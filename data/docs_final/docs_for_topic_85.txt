It\u2019s very important to know which one you have because the treatments may be completely different. Understanding these differences can help you to accurately diagnose your condition. So what exactly are these differences and how can you tell them apart?\nThere are several signs that can give you a clue as to which one you might have. For example, usually those affected with psoriasis share the condition with a family member. However, just because psoriasis may run in your family doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you will inherit it. Besides a familial tie, psoriasis can occur in those with certain triggers. The most common triggers include stressful situations, taking certain medications such as lithium, weather conditions, and even a diet.\nOn the other hand, eczema is usually not related to genetic factors. The body\u2019s immune system plays more of a role in this case. Eczema generally affects children and infants whereas psoriasis is more commonly present in adults. In cases of eczema, your skin appears to be very itchy at first and the rash presents itself later.\nThe most helpful sign in telling the difference is the location. If your rash is on the back of the elbows or the front of the knees then it is most likely psoriasis. However, if it is on the inside of the arms or the back of the knees then it is safe to assume it is eczema. While scientists are still trying to figure out exactly what causes psoriasis and eczema, one thing they can be certain of is that psoriasis and eczema are not contagious. You cannot get them from touching someone who has either.\nTreatments for both include lotions, creams, and even medications. While the conditions are different, the goal of the treatment is the same: to smooth the skin and relieve any discomfort.\nSchedule an appointment today with one of our board certified physicians to gain more knowledge about your skin so it can reach its fullest, healthiest potential!\nContact Knoxville Dermatology Group at 865.690.9467.\nThis entry was posted on Thursday, August 18th, 2011 at 9:05 am and is filed under Uncategorized .

Using reports from 150 million dermatology visits logged into the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey, researchers found 4.7 million visits for psoriasis. They then compared this figure to the number of patients diagnosed with depression.\nThey found that the risk of depression was 4.5 times more likely in younger patients (age 40 and under) with psoriasis. The risk was also elevated, but less so, in those over age 40 (1.8 times more likely). They attributed this difference to the significant effects of psoriasis on socializing, finding a partner and establishing a career in younger persons suffering from this disease. The degree of depression has also been correlated with the degree of itch in some patients.\nSource:\nJesitus J. Depression and Psoriasis.

With careful inspection, it should be possible to differentiate these psoriasis posers from the real thing. Psoriasis is most likely to be confused with another rash based on the location of the rash. For example many things can cause a red scaly rash in the groin area other than psoriasis.\nScalp Rashes That Aren't Psoriasis\nScaly red rashes on the scalp can be caused by seborrheic dermatitis, also known as dandruff. The difference is that psoriasis of the scalp often has significant thickening of the skin and thick adherent scales. Seborrheic dermatitis usually just has some pinkness of the skin of the scalp with much finer scales. Seborrheic dermatitis often involves the eyebrows and the sides of the nostrils as well, so sometimes involvement of these areas will help to separate this disease from psoriasis.\nFungal infections of the scalp are not so rare in children and so a child with a scaly scalp may have fungus, psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis. Hairs can be plucked and examined under a microscope to help confirm a diagnosis of fungus.\nFlexural Area Rashes that Aren't Psoriasis\nIn the creases of the armpits and groin area, as well as under breasts, the increased moisture present tends to macerate scales creating a pasty white substance. Redness and maceration can be seen with both psoriasis or candidiasis (common yeast infection). A dryer red rash with scales around the edges is typical of tinea cruris or \"Jock Itch\". A darker discolored patch in this area without scaliness may be erythrasma, a minor bacterial infection. Your dermatologist can examine skin scales or debris under a microscope or use an ultraviolet light called a Wood's Light to help differentiate these rashes from psoriasis.\nHand and Foot Rashes that Aren't Psoriasis\nHand and foot rashes may be the most difficult to differentiate from true psoriasis. Eczema, fungal infections, allergic reactions and irritation from chemicals can all cause changes which may be confused with psoriasis. Most of these rashes cause thickening, redness and scales on the backs of the hands or feet but may cause a blistering rash on the palms and soles. Nail changes can occur in fungus or severe eczema involving the cuticle areas. Skin biopsies from hand and foot rashes can be confusing and often show mixed features in the same specimen. Differentiating hand and foot rashes from psoriasis requires significant skill and usually necessitates examination of other body parts, ie: scalp, elbows, knees, to look for clues.\nSuggested Reading\n"}, {"score": 1240.8479, "uuid": "73d8ebc5-12eb-53e0-a11a-a233c30b23dc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0005wb-77-27475", "target_hostname": "psoriasis.about.com", "target_uri": "http://psoriasis.about.com/lw/Health-Medicine/Conditions-and-diseases/Complementary-and-Alternative-Psoriasis-Treatments.htm", "page_rank": 1.1787884e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Alternative <em>Psoriasis</em> Treatments - Complementary and Alternative <em>Psoriasis</em>", "snippet": ". * Alternative, Complementary and Integrative Medicine and Therapies * Alternative Medicine in Asthma - <em>What</em> <em>is</em> Alternative Medicine in Asthma * <em>What</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> <em>Difference</em> Between &quot;Alternative&quot; and &quot;Complementary&quot; Medicine?", "explanation": null, "document": "Complementary and Alternative Psoriasis\u00a0Treatments\nNon-Drug Therapies Used in the Treatment of\u00a0Psoriasis\nFrom\u00a0Lia Tremblay,\nAbout.com Health's Disease and Condition content is reviewed by the Medical Review Board\nFiled In:\nPsoriasis\n(LifeWire) - Conventional medicine works to discover new drugs and procedures that can treat an\u00a0illness. However, even in the presence of such conventional medicine, individuals frequently explore complementary\u00a0or alternative therapies to help address what ails them. For psoriasis sufferers, this search can include anything from massage to tea tree oil.\nBut what do these alternative\u00a0remedies do? Are they safe? Do they even work?\nWhat Are Complementary and Alternative Therapies?\nComplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies include a number of healthcare practices that are considered outside the scope of conventional medicine. Some doctors, however, do practice a combination of approaches, referred to as integrative medicine.\nComplementary therapies are used in addition to conventional medicine; alternative therapies are used instead of conventional medicine; and some treatments can be complementary or alternative, depending on how they are used. In either case, the use of CAM therapies should be discussed with your doctor to be sure that what you have chosen to try is safe for you.\nCAM Therapies for Psoriasis\nMind-body Practices\nYoga and meditation are popular complementary therapies for many chronic conditions. These types of therapy may help provide relief from\u00a0both the physical and emotional pain\u00a0associated with\u00a0living with an illness.\u00a0Many individuals\u00a0believe that massage can be particularly helpful in alleviating the pain of psoriatic arthritis. No clinical studies have\u00a0evaluated the effect of mind-body practices on psoriasis, however.\nDietary Supplements\nOmega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in flaxseed oil and fish oil supplements, are said to decrease inflammation and itching. However,\u00a0studies evaluating the utility of omega-3s\u00a0in the treatment of psoriasis\u00a0have proved inconclusive.\nA variety of topical remedies have been used by psoriasis sufferers:\nAloe Vera\nFluid squeezed from the leaves of this common houseplant has long been a favorite natural remedy for burns and cuts. Its effectiveness in fighting psoriasis has\u00a0received mixed results in clinical trials.\nApple Cider Vinegar\nPrized for its disinfectant qualities,\u00a0apple cider vinegar\u00a0is available at any grocery store. Individuals who use apple cider vinegar say that it can soothe psoriasis flare-ups when added to bathwater or moisturizer, or applied directly to the skin. There is no clinical evidence to support or refute this claim, but it remains popular among patients.\nCapsaicin\nExtracted from cayenne peppers, capsaicin acts\u00a0to block pain and itch sensations from reaching the brain. It is often used by sufferers of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It is sold over the counter in lotions, creams and patches. Studies have shown that it can decrease redness and scaling in psoriasis patients, but care must be taken to keep it away from the eyes, nose and mouth.\nDead Sea Salts\nIsrael's Dead Sea is situated 1,200 feet below sea level, the lowest point on the Earth's surface. Its remarkably high salt content is said to give the water curative properties and has made the area a haven for clinics that cater to psoriasis sufferers. For those who cannot visit\u00a0Israel, products containing Dead Sea salts and mud have been imported for use at home. However, studies indicate that the benefit of a Dead Sea visit is in the exposure to the area's sun and climate, rather than the water.\nEmu Oil\nThis oil is made from the fat of the emu, a large bird native to Australia, and is found in many products that claim to protect and soften skin. The oil and the products that contain it can be relatively expensive,\u00a0and no clinical research in humans has been performed to determine its worth.\nEvening Primrose Oil\nThis oil is usually found in capsule form as a dietary supplement, but the oil inside each capsule can be applied directly to the skin. It has been found to be successful in treating eczema, another skin condition. However, two studies\u00a0performed to determine the\u00a0effectiveness of this oil\u00a0in treating psoriasis found no benefit.\nOats\nDerivatives of the oat plant have been used for years in bath preparations to soothe irritated and itchy skin. They can be found in a number of commercial products or added with oil directly to a bath. While no clinical research has been done to specifically address the effect of oats\u00a0on psoriasis, anecdotal evidence suggests that they temporarily relieve dryness and itching.\nTea Tree Oil\nNative to Australia, the tea tree produces an oil that is said to have antiseptic qualities. It has been used in everything from dentistry to dermatology, and may be particularly helpful to sufferers of scalp psoriasis. However, it may cause allergic reactions in some\u00a0individuals and should be used with care. Additionally, no clinical studies have examined the effectiveness of tea tree oil in the treatment of psoriasis.\nA Word to the Wise\nBe sure to talk with your doctor before trying any of these products. Even the most harmless-sounding plant\u00a0may cause an\u00a0allergic reaction or interact dangerously with\u00a0conventional drug treatment.

They follow logical rules. The problem can be solved, so long as one is able to discern those rules.\nOne or more of the common substances in your home and outdoor environments that you or your child is touching, eating, and possibly inhaling, is causing the eczema and you can track it down.\nThrough this approach, we were able to completely eliminate our son\u2019s breakouts without steroids or any other medication.\nPlease remember that I am not a doctor or health care professional. I am just another parent trying to share what helped us track down the cause of our son\u2019s eczema. Please read my disclaimer , use your judgment, respect your individual sensitivities, and consult your own doctor as often as necessary.\n_top_\nWhy I didn\u2019t just wait for my child to outgrow the eczema.\nIt\u2019s hard to talk to anyone about infantile eczema without someone suggesting the baby might outgrow it. Personally, I couldn\u2019t see waiting helplessly hoping this might happen.\nMy infant son\u2019s eczema was so severe, it began affecting his development. He couldn\u2019t sleep, his mood, personality, and behavior changed. The broken skin became infected easily. To my husband and me, finding the cause was a matter of urgency.\nAlthough doing the detective work and eliminating the cause from our home has required a lot of work, NOT eliminating the eczema seemed far more labor intensive and detrimental. The unpredictable and often serious medical, social, personal, and emotional aspects of dealing with such severe, ongoing eczema were, to us, far more time- and energy-consuming.\nIn his book Touchpoints, Dr. T. Berry Brazelton writes about the emotional consequences: \u201cAvoiding frightening outbreaks of asthma or eczema is very important to the future well-being of a child\u2026. Once an allergy is set in motion, and if a treatment that works is not found, children feel increasing anxiety and helplessness.\u201d\nIt made such a huge difference emotionally to all of us to find the key that made the outbreaks predictable and allowed us to clear our son\u2019s skin completely.\nAfter a long discussion with our pediatrician and a pediatric nutritionist, as well as additional reading, I also felt that even if my son did \u201cgrow out of it,\u201d my efforts to eliminate the cause of the eczema might mitigate future asthma symptoms.\nIt seemed that there was no reason to believe the eczema would likely go away on its own anyway.\nNot every informational source I\u2019ve read agrees about the prevalence of eczema, and prevalence seems to differ from country to country, but I am in accord with the following:\nFrom ( http://www.healthnewsflash.com/conditions/atopic_dermatitis.htm ):\n\u201cScientists estimate that 65 percent of patients develop eczema skin symptoms in the first year of life, and 90 percent develop eczema symptoms before the age of 5.\nRoughly 60 percent of these infants continue to have one or more symptoms of atopic dermatitis into adulthood. This means that more than 15 million people in the United States have symptoms of the disease.\nMany children who outgrow the symptoms of eczema go on to develop hay fever or asthma.\u201d\nEczema and asthma cases have soared in recent years, and no one really knows why. In our modern world, we are exposed to thousands of new substances that didn\u2019t exist at all 20, 50, 100 years ago. My son wouldn\u2019t have had eczema 90 years ago, because synthetic detergents didn\u2019t exist on the planet. Their use has skyrocketed since the \u00e2\u0080\u009870s especially.\nSo, when people ask if I think my son will outgrow his allergy, I have to answer that there is no basis to know, because the presence of such high levels of detergents on our persons and in home environments is so new. The same is probably true for other allergens like latex. I read recently in Science News that two common plasticizers, the residues of which are commonly found in household dust in western countries, have been linked to allergy and asthma. These weren\u2019t nearly so common 30 years ago, if they had been invented at all.\nPast experience as to whether children will outgrow eczema is probably misleading. My guess is that as eczema rates continue to rise, the percentage of children that continue to have symptoms into adulthood (the percentage that don\u2019t outgrow it) will also rise.\nMaintaining our son\u2019s clear skin has been less work than removing detergent sources at the start.\n_top_\nHealthy Skin, Unhealthy Environmental Exposures\nA great deal of research and publication have gone into the subject of finding a defect in the skin of eczema patients, ostensibly to find treatments. One such line of inquiry concerned whether persons with eczema have ceramide deficiency. Ceramides \u201crepresent the major constituent of the free extractable intercellular lipids and play a significant role in maintaining and structuring the water permeability barrier of the skin.\u201d [Farwanah H, Raith K, Neubert RH, Wohlrab J., Ceramide profiles of the uninvolved skin in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are comparable to those of healthy skin, Arch Dermatol Res. 2005 May;296(11):514-521.]\nThe above researchers found that if they looked at the ceramide profiles of both \"lesional involved\" as well as the \u201cnormal-appearing uninvolved\u201d skin, the uninvolved skin was just like healthy normal skin. There are other similar lines of inquiry in the literature, which in my opinion point more strongly to an environmental cause of virtually all eczema than anything else, i.e., the eczema results from something AFFECTING the skin rather than something ABOUT the skin.\nCertainly, skin type is an issue \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some people seem more susceptible to the effects of detergents and other causes of eczema. Since genes determine skin type, it would be possible to make genetic correlations. But in that case, correlation does not mean causality. If skin type makes one more susceptible to eczema from products that were only invented in the last century, that in my opinion is a failing in the design of these products that are not safe for all skin types, not a defect in people with more affected skin types.\n_top_ Eczema breakouts follow logical rules, the trick is seeing them.\nEczema breakouts can seem maddeningly random. It would have been very easy for us to believe that the solution would never be obvious, obscured by the complexity of the human body or the mystery of some complicated genetic defect.\nAt least I could quickly see that trying this and trying that, thinking the cause was too elusive to track down, was leading more to frustration than solutions.\nThat has also been the case for other parents I have tried to help. The least successful haven\u2019t put in any less work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in fact, often they put in more \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but the efforts were unfocused, as if somehow solving such a problem is a game of chance rather than a mystery to solve by logical steps and persistence. It is easy for even very educated people to begin behaving in an almost superstitious manner, trying this product and that product, and avoiding all the unknown and unseen exposures in a random and desperate way.\nI see over and over again how parents solve their children's eczema \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from this and other causes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when they accept that the problem isn't random, and that the breakouts really are directly related to concrete and proportional exposures. Figuring out what those are is of course the difficult part, because of how complicated the environmental exposures can be. Detergents in dust (which can adhere to the skin), for example, cause a whole set of unseen exposures, complicated by the nonlinear effect in the presence of small amounts of water (such as sweating).\n_top_\nNot Everything That Affects Eczema is a True Cause\nIt is easy, too, to become a slave to addressing the \u201ctriggers\u201d rather than getting to the true cause. Dryness, for example, is often called both a \u201ccause\u201d and a \u201ctrigger\u201d for eczema. The CAUSE of our son\u2019s eczema was detergent, dryness was a trigger. Every winter, when the heat comes on and dries out the air, our son\u2019s skin becomes more susceptible to breakouts from lower levels of detergent exposure. But absent the detergents, his skin can be very dry with no eczema. With detergent exposure, we can moisturize our hearts out, and it might help, but we have to keep at it and keep at it, and still it won\u2019t make the eczema go away.\nExposure to pollen has worked the same way. When our son is exposed to oak tree pollen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which gives him the usual respiratory symptoms \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he then breaks out from lower levels of detergent exposure. But absent any detergent exposure, the pollens don\u2019t seem to cause him eczema.\nI have heard a good analogy for allergy as a bucket \u00e2\u0080\u0094 exposure to different things we are allergic to fills the bucket. We experience symptoms when the bucket is filled to overflowing. If the bucket is always close to overflowing because of a lot of exposure to one allergen, then even small exposures to that allergen or to other things we might otherwise tolerate cause the bucket to overflow. But if we are able to keep the bucket relatively empty by avoiding enough of the thing or things to which we are most allergic, then we may be able to tolerate occasional exposures without problems.\nIn the above analogy, the presence of triggers might make it easier to overflow a full bucket, but removing the triggers doesn\u2019t help us empty the bucket like removing the cause(s) does.\nIn his book Touchpoints, Dr. T. Berry Brazelton recommends a preventive approach. \u201cOnce an allergic symptom is out in the open, it is harder to get rid of. At that point, we must eliminate not only the immediate cause but also the milder offenders. If a parent is willing and able to do this, the child may be able to tolerate the more potent stimulus from time to time. So, with a child who gets hay fever with each cold, or eczema every time he eats wheat, or asthma every time he is upset, a preventive approach will seek to eliminate all of the allergens he lives with, even though he can live with them most of the time.\u201d\nAs I point out in my letter , the advice in Touchpoints helped us figure out the cause of our son\u2019s eczema. The chapter on Allergies is worth reading: while the chapter is fairly compact, the advice and perspective are unique among parenting books and consistent with my own experience with allergy. I recommend reading through the chapter two or three times to start, and again as necessary. The general allergy prevention approach will help some to \u201cempty the bucket\u201d to allow a more clear stage to track down any unidentified major offender. Brazelton recommends a list of general allergy control measures in this chapter.\n_top_\nThe Detergent Piece of the Puzzle\nIn the course of trying to figure out why our son has this reaction to detergents, I have come to believe that the problem has to do with skin membrane permeability.\nDetergents increase skin membrane permeability in a way that soaps and water do not. This type of eczema \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which I believe is probably 25-60% of the eczema problem, depending on the age group \u00e2\u0080\u0094 seems purely to result from how detergents increase the permeability of skin. The behavior of the eczema is entirely consistent with that premise.\nWhen my son and other children like him are not exposed to detergents at home, their skin becomes normal and isn\u2019t especially dry. There is no need even to moisturize.\nRegarding membrane permeability, a microbiologist explained the difference between soaps and detergents like this:\nHumans have made soaps for thousands of years, by reacting fats or oils with alkaline substances, such as ashes or soda ash. Synthetic detergents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which can be synthesized from many different kinds of starting ingredients, but were initially developed from petroleum \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were invented in the 20th century. Soaps and detergents are long molecules which are attracted to oils on one end and water on the other. Among other differences, detergents are far more hydrophilic (water-attracting) than soaps. Detergent residues also seem to be far more persistent in fabrics and tissues.\nHumans evolved with the natural fatty acid profile of skin that best repels water while maintaining necessary functions, such as perspiration. Both soaps and detergents remove lipids that help maintain that barrier.\nWhen we use soap, even if residues remain on the skin, we are swapping the skin lipids with something that has essentially the same hydration properties. But detergents are longer, skinny molecules that can slip into deeper layers of skin, and the end sticking out \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the hydrophilic end \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is far, far more hydrophilic than the water-loving end of soap molecules. There can even be more than one hydrophilic branch on that end of a detergent molecule. The natural barrier to water penetration (and loss) is lost as these highly hydrophilic molecules build up on the surface. We need that barrier to maintain the integrity of the skin.\nIn my experience, the effect of detergents on membrane permeability is nonlinear \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it goes up exponentially in the presence of small amounts of water (where there is sweating or in the moist environment of the lungs). So someone may touch or be exposed to detergents and seem fine until they sweat, and then the skin will break out, especially in the moist areas. Much of the seeming randomness of eczema affected by detergents comes about because of the unseen exposures from household dust, how they adhere to and are absorbed in the skin, and the nonlinear effect of detergents on skin membrane permeability in the presence of small amounts of water.\nAn interesting side note: modern high-tech fabrics for outdoor clothing and gear specify washing in soap, not detergents, because detergents destroy the water repellency. From the Nikwax web site www.nikwax-usa.com :\n\u201cAll detergents work in basically the same way. They contain molecules that enable them to be soluble in water and attract oil and dirt to them. These molecules clean by attracting themselves to dirt via the oleophilic (oil attracting) end. The dirt is thereby surrounded by hydrophilic (water attracting) ends which allow it to be wetted and carried away by water. Detergents molecules can remain in clothing causing them to attract water and diminish the water repellent properties of the garment. Nikwax Tech-Wash is a non-detergent soap that does not leave a residue and actually removes the detergent residues from garments that have been washed in them.\u201d (Nikwax makes a soap product for washing outdoor gear that may be appropriate for general clothes washing. I have not tried it. Please see the last section for a list of different soap products.)\nThe effect of detergent residues on the skin membrane is analogous to what happens to these water repellant fabrics.\nThere is a substantial body of relevant research in fields like patch test dermatology and ophthalmology outlining these effects. For example, in 2005, some ophthalmological researchers published a paper about their attempts to develop a better skin test for substances used in the eye. The eyes are more sensitive than the skin and more prone to bad reactions. These researchers wanted to be able to predict allergic reactions of the eye with skin testing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to essentially amplify the skin response. They accomplished this with sodium lauryl sulfate, the most common household detergent, which \"increased antigen penetration.\" [Corazza M ,Virgili A, Allergic contact dermatitis from ophthalmic products: can pre-treatment with sodium lauryl sulfate increase patch test sensitivity? Contact Dermatitis 2005 May;52(5):239-41.]\n_top_\nThe Atopic March \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Asthmatics May Benefit From Switching to Soaps\nBecause of the increased antigen penetration associated with detergents, the way they pervade household dust, and the longer time required to clear those exposures from the lungs, there is almost no way that detergents in the dust of people's homes ISN'T a primary reason for the upswing in asthma rates in recent decades.\nIt was very clear to us that detergents make up a great part of household dust (from residues on hair, lint, skin cells, etc., even flaking from washed surfaces), and that dust is impossible to keep from affecting the skin.\nSwitching to soaps may be helpful for all children with allergies and asthma, even those with no eczema. Detergents are breathed in with household dust, and their presence in lung tissue increases susceptibility of those tissues to allergens that may be causing the asthma. Detergents have been shown to increase membrane healing time, which may also have an impact especially where viruses are associated with asthma. Because the detergent effect on membrane permeability is exponentially greater in the presence of small amounts of water, the unseen effect on the lungs could be significantly greater than the visible effect on the skin.\nI hear over and over again from people who \"outgrow\" eczema only to develop asthma. It\u2019s called the \u201catopic march\u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 first eczema, then asthma.\nWith detergent-reactive eczema, it\u2019s a logical progression from ongoing detergent exposure. Babies have highly permeable skin and spend a good deal of time with their skin against fabrics or a parent's skin or hair. As children get older, they spend less time lying down or crawling across surfaces. Their skin becomes naturally less permeable, absorbs and retains fewer detergents. They could easily seem to \"outgrow\" the eczema. But they also become more active and push more air in and out of their lungs. Any damaging effect of detergents on the skin is now unseen in the lungs.\nRecently, a mother of an asthmatic preschooler thanked me for my web site. Her 5-year-old developed early asthma. She\u2019s a supermom who does everything in her power to minimize the allergy risk in her home, yet still they had inhalers and occasional trips to the hospital. When she removed detergents from their home environment, they finally got the asthma under control. Her son never had eczema.\nDetergents aren't the underlying cause of the asthma, they merely amplify other processes. Their presence in dust causes a whole set of unseen exposures, complicated by the nonlinear effect in the presence of small amounts of water.\nA major study of women employed in domestic cleaning in Barcelona, Spain, concluded that \u201cemployment in domestic cleaning may induce or aggravate asthma,\u201d and that the risks probably extend to \u201cpeople undertaking cleaning tasks at home.\u201d [Medina-Ramon M, Zock JP, Kogevinas M, Sunyer J, Anto JM, Asthma symptoms in women employed in domestic cleaning: a community based study. Thorax 2003 Nov;58(11):950-4.] The study authors felt the asthma was probably related to cleaning products but did not make specific conclusions.\nA plethora of new studies demonstrate that asthma rates in the industrialized world have soared in the last twenty years, even where smoking and air pollution have declined. In that time, breastfeeding, which Brazelton (and research studies) suggests is protective against eczema and asthma, is way up in industrialized countries. And as much as some people suggest that we are too clean today, when I was a child in the \u00e2\u0080\u009860s, I remember women under far greater social pressure to keep clean houses, using a potent armament of cleaning supplies: powerful disinfectants, bleach, ammonia, soaps, unmentionable chemicals we don\u2019t even use today like dry cleaning solvents, and they were WAY more casual about using them. Newsweek dedicated a cover story to the topic of how much LESS we are cleaning today than our parents did. They smoked more, breathed in more polluted air, cleaned house more, and had less asthma.\nWhat they didn't have so much then, that we use now, that we eat every day, that we are covered in from head to toe, that didn't exist on the planet 90 years ago, are detergents. The use of detergents in first-world home environments has increased every decade since their introduction around World War II, skyrocketing in the last few decades. (The use of soaps, by the way, began to decline with the introduction of detergents, and leveled off to a constant level around 1960.)\nThe switch to soaps for asthma will not have the relatively rapid and obvious effect that the switch for eczema will, because it takes weeks for the residues to clear from the lungs. It may take two or three months from the time a home is made detergent-free for the difference to be obvious.\n_top_\nIncreased Healing Times and Other Effects\nKeith Green, Ph.D., D.Sc., Regents\u2019 Professor Emeritus, Department of Ophthalmology, and Professor Emeritus, Department of Physiology, and School of Graduate Studies at the Medical College of Georgia (now deceased), published a number of studies on the effects of detergents and preservatives on rabbit eyes (rabbit eyes are a close animal model for human eyes). I found a lot of alarmist interpretations of his work on the web, and one even more inaccurate and misleading letter supposedly debunking them, but I did find one web-listed paper that seems to summarize his work fairly well: \" Detergent Penetration into Young and Adult Eyes\" http://www.personalhealthfacts.com/carcinogens8.pdf . The paper is ostensibly by Dr. Green and lists many of his references at the end. The summary seemed a fair representation of his work:\n\u201c Using animal models, we have examined the effects in the eye of one of the detergents, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), that is included in soaps and shampoos. We also have determined how SLS is taken up by the eye. Four findings have ensued: first, SLS is rapidly taken up and accumulated by eye tissues. SLS is retained for up to five days in most eye tissues. Second, SLS uptake is greater in younger rabbits with decreasing amounts with increasing age. Third, SLS causes changes in the amounts of some proteins of eye tissues whether they are treated in the living animal or tissues are bathed in SLS while in tissue culture. Fourth, SLS treatment extends the healing time of the corneal epithelium (the cellular surface layer of the cornea) to 10 days, far beyond the normal two days.\u201d\nNo conclusions were made about the protein changes, it was merely an observation made in the course of the research. However, since Dr. Green was an ophthalmologist, he was concerned with the issue of extended healing times and how small amounts of detergents might affect healing from surgery. He did other work investigating other preservatives and detergents from that standpoint.\nWhen our son's eczema was at its worst, both I and my husband noticed a marked slowing in our son's ability to heal the usual baby cuts (usually from his fingernails, often from scratching his eczema). Instead of a couple of days to heal completely, a cut might take ten days or two weeks. I thought this was an interesting potential correlation with this eye research. When we got rid of our son's breakouts, his skin started healing normally again.\nBelow is an excerpt from a Reuters story (Oct. 9, 2002) about a research study which showed slower immune response on the skin of people with eczema \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I have also wondered if this ties in. There is no way, given what I have seen, that these patients were removed from detergent sources on the skin for long enough \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or at all \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to know whether the sluggish response tied in to the same detergent sensitivity as my son\u2019s. I would be very curious to know the results of an identical study before and after people had detergents removed from their skin and environment, and even more curious to know how lung tissue is affected under the same circumstances in the same patients (especially since viral problems seem to play a role in asthma):\n\u201c The new study, led by Peck Ong of the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, found that the skin of 8 people with the most common form of eczema, known as atopic dermatitis, was sluggish in producing small chemicals called peptides that thwart bacteria, viruses and fungi.\nIn contrast, they discovered that 11 volunteers with a similar condition, psoriasis, had skin with high levels of peptides to fight off germs. Even though psoriasis also breaks down the natural barrier that keeps microorganisms out of the skin, people with that condition are less prone to skin infections than those with eczema. Generally, 30 percent of the millions of people with eczema, characterized by itchy red swollen skin, often in the folds of the elbows or the back of the knees, have skin infections. That's four times higher than the 7 percent who have psoriasis, which affects 5.5 million Americans and is characterized by the growth of unsightly patches of thick skin, the Ong team said.\u201d\nThe reference for this research: Peck Y. Ong, M.D., Takaaki Ohtake, M.D., Ph.D., Corinne Brandt, B.S., Ian Strickland, Ph.D., Mark Boguniewicz, M.D., Tomas Ganz, M.D., Ph.D., Richard L. Gallo, M.D., Ph.D., and Donald Y.M. Leung, M.D., Ph.D. (2002 Oct 10) Endogenous Antimicrobial Peptides and Skin Infections in Atopic Dermatitis, NEJM 347:1151-1160.\nPeople with other types of eczema also often benefit by removing detergents, though they may not completely resolve their eczema. Eliminating detergents in the diets of infants (mainly from dishes) may be preventive by reducing allergens that enter the bloodstream early on. I have been corresponding with a woman who has a similar patient-run site to my own, for a type of eczema called dyshidrosis. I believe from everything I have read that the cause of this type of eczema is probably microbial. The eczema behaves very differently from detergent-reactive eczema. Yet this woman has told me that switching to a detergent-free household last year has essentially ended her breakouts. I think just allowing her skin membrane to function normally allows her immune system to keep the problem under control.\nSince detergents are ubiquitous in medical environments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on surfaces, fabrics, surgical tools, and even in fractionated blood products \u00e2\u0080\u0094 recognizing and understanding this sensitivity may be of some importance to the outcome of other medical care for affected children, perhaps all sick children.\nIf Your Child Might Have This Problem\nIf you think your child\u2019s eczema might be caused by detergents, removing ALL SOURCES of detergent may be necessary to tell for certain. I note with some irony that the \u201cbefore\u201d photo used in my letter to the National Eczema Association for Science and Education (NEASE www.nationaleczema.org ) was taken after we had already switched to soaps to wash clothing and linens, soap to wash household surfaces, and soap for handwashed dishes. (Download the letter and photo from the Downloads page.)We hadn\u2019t yet realized we needed to wash our own hair with soap, use a non-detergent product in the dishwasher, or eliminate hidden detergents in processed foods \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all relatively minor sources compared with those we had already eliminated. Indeed, at the time, our son\u2019s eczema looked considerably better. But he continued to have breakouts like the one in the photo until we knew how to eliminate all detergent sources.\n_top_\nAnaphylactic Allergies Are A Different Story\nAlthough this is only my opinion, I believe that anaphylactic allergies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the kind that cause deadly reactions, such as to peanuts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are different than \u201cnormal\u201d allergies. It is possible for anyone to be allergic to anything, and it is certainly possible for someone with anaphylactic allergies to also have this detergent sensitivity. However, in my experience so far, I would guess that eczema in a person with anaphylactic allergies is likely from a different cause than detergents, though there may be a secondary benefit in strengthening skin and gut membranes from reducing detergent use as described in the previous paragraphs.\nHowever, the risks associated with such a switch need to be considered: many soap products come from the \u201cnatural\u201d products sector, and \u201cnatural\u201d products may contain food derivatives, such as citrus oils, nut oils, wheat protein, you name it, to which a severely allergic child could react. Parents of children with such severe allergies know how to track down every little ingredient in foods to protect their children; the same vigilance is necessary here.\n_top_\nOther Types of Eczema With Solutions\nWhen I first started writing this site, I felt I could only address our direct experience. However, I am frustrated by the poor resources parents are given to problem solve eczema. While switching to soaps is probably a prudent step for anyone with allergies, it will not eliminate everyone\u2019s eczema, other measures are necessary depending on the underlying cause. Some of these measures I hear over and over again from parents who figured them out the hard way. I felt I should share the most common ones.\nThis list is a work in progress based on observations I have made over the years and feedback I have received from my web site. It is my opinion at the present time and not from scientific study. I will likely revise and update it in time, especially to expand solution steps.\nI note again that I am not a medical professional. Some of these steps, especially #2 below, have their own pitfalls and have to be dealt with in concert with an experienced medical professional. As anyone who has dealt much with eczema knows, there is a wide range of knowledge and opinion in the medical profession about eczema. It is worth finding those doctors with relevant experience. In the case of the eczema causes below, allergists who understand a lot about fungi, and naturopathic physicians with a research background are probably good resources.\nAs I see it, these as the major \"types\" of full-body eczema in children:\nDetergent-reactive eczema, per this site. In the absence of detergents in the environment, these people have normal skin and no eczema. This eczema has been described precisely in research concerning dermatological patch testing, so I believe it constitutes 25% of adult eczema and what I now believe is probably 40%-60% of infantile eczema. Now that detergents are so ubiquitous, this type of eczema almost exclusively begins in infancy.\nThe increased membrane permeability from detergents probably contributes though is not the cause in other types of eczema as well.\nGiven the mechanism for the eczema, measures that eliminate the eczema should be maintained to reduce susceptibility to asthma, even as the skin becomes naturally less permeable (naturally absorbing less detergent and becoming less reactive to detergent exposures) with age.\nMicrobially-induced eczema, systemic, mainly from an internal yeast/fungal problem. The eczema seems to result from something brought to the skin in sweat, so it behaves similarly to detergent-reactive eczema. The diaper area may be clear, the skin is most affected when and where there is sweat, washing with non-drying soaps seems to help.\nThese people benefit from a switch to soaps but it doesn't get rid of the problem. Typically they resolve the problem through dietary changes, mainly yeast-suppression diets (not possible with an infant), and antimicrobial measures, mainly antifungal measures that may range from taking probiotics (beneficial bacteria) to antifungal medications prescribed by a physician. Sometimes other support for the immune system is also helpful.\nI believe this is the segment of eczema that is largely prevented when pregnant women and infants are given probiotics, thus I would put it at about 25-40% of eczema cases, probably closer to 30% of infantile eczema.\nAssociated with this type of eczema (prior to effective interventions) are higher rates of: multiple food allergies and anaphylactic allergies, learning disabilities, autism, asthma, other GI problems, high levels of staph infection, and in adults, Type II diabetes, hayfever, and depression. Frequent washing of the sweat and antibiotic therapies seem to help but result only in short-lived improvements. This type of eczema can appear at any age.\nThere is a great deal of literature by allergists worldwide on the topic of yeasts and the role of antifungal medications in treating eczema. I haven\u2019t found any research I think of as definitive, or offering true solutions, but each paper and experience offers pieces of the puzzle. The following list is a good place to start, though is by no means comprehensive.\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&cmd=Link&dbFrom=PubMed&from_uid=12364369\nIn that link alone are 157 articles on atopic dermatitis and fungi. Such as, \"Framing the future of antifungals in atopic dermatitis.\"\nExcept for the important measures of taking probiotics (beneficial bacteria, as many strains as possible) and possibly dietary changes that sharply reduce simple sugars and gluten, I strongly recommend against experimenting with antifungal remedies, especially herbs, since the potential pitfalls are far greater than with detergent-reactive eczema. See a medical professional truly experienced in treating fungal problems. I can\u2019t emphasize that enough. An experienced medical professional should be able to explain the potential for Jarisch-Herxheimer responses in fungal treatment, and know how to reduce it. I strongly recommend against taking any general measures involving chronic intake of antifungal treatments (especially herbs), since this can result in serious pitfalls, such as major depression and gallbladder disease. A true solution more likely involves environmental review and a course of treatment intended to completely resolve fungal problems and restore a more normal internal microbial environment. Proper environmental mold control and a household elimination of detergents should drastically reduce or eliminate asthma symptoms.\nFood-induced eczema. Foods involved are mainly those with high protein/albumin content or those that contain the highest levels of molds/mycotoxins or promote mold growth: eggs, milk, nuts, wheat, etc. Eczema resolves when the offending food is removed from the diet.\nAccording to Dr. Sears, \"over 90 percent of food allergies, especially in young children, are caused by seven foods: dairy products, soy, shellfish, wheat, tree nuts, peanuts, egg whites.\u201d Corn, citrus, and tomatoes are also likely suspects \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially corn which is a hidden ingredient in so many processed foods. This type of eczema typically begins in infancy but can begin at any age.\nEczema from albumin-containing foods is more often \"outgrown\" than eczema from other foods. The foods triggering eczema may sometimes be safely reintroduced when a child is older. In contrast to children with detergent-reactive eczema, I think in this case the problem truly is outgrown \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the more mature gut becomes naturally less permeable and is no longer letting those proteins into the bloodstream.\nThe health and permeability of the GI tract may be an issue; not eating detergents (mainly from dishes) will probably help but will not eliminate this problem. Eliminating detergents in the diets of infants may be preventive by reducing allergens that enter the bloodstream early on. Probiotics (beneficial bacteria) will likely also help (see section on probiotics and eczema). Research has demonstrated not only reduced rates of infantile eczema with probiotic use, but also a reduced rates of milk allergy.\nMicrobially-induced eczema, mainly fungal (or then complicated by bacterial or viral), superficial. This segment probably includes dyshidrosis and other conditions which behave as if the skin is infected more superficially. The eczema behaves differently than the above types. Removing detergents may reduce frequency of breakouts but will not resolve an existing breakout. Simplistic antimicrobial therapies are often only temporarily helpful and lasting relief involves steps more close to a combination of 1 and 2 above, plus topical antimicrobial therapy and/or scrubbing affected skin with antimicrobial solutions to end an existing breakout. This type of eczema is more a problem for adults and far less so for infants. Immune support or resolution of other health problems may in some cases be enough to prevent recurrence of this type of eczema.\nAll children with eczema are prone to superficial infections, which can require appropriate antimicrobial treatment before eczema will resolve, regardless of the underlying cause. If microbial infections recur quickly after resolving with treatment, sometimes a more thorough approach is necessary. Underlying fungal problems, for example, can create an environment that favors recurrence of pathogenic bacteria, such as with chronic sinusitis.\nEczema from low levels of essential fatty acids (EFA\u2019s), which seems to respond in an uncomplicated way to EFA supplementation, eliminating the eczema. Those in category 1 & 2 (detergent-reactive eczema and myco-responsive eczema) will likely have no apparent benefit or may experience a slight increase in eczema from EFA supplementation. Those with eczema that resolves with EFA supplementation will see the least improvement from detergent removal.\nUncomplicated contact reactions from irritating substances such as nickel or dyes and perfumes. Some of the classic contact irritants are more likely to be problems in older children and adults than infants. Uncomplicated contact reactions happen right where the skin touches the irritant, so removing the contact irritant resolves the breakouts. Eliminating detergents should decrease susceptibility to reactions.\nAll other reactions, probably less than 10% of the overall eczema population. Includes more idiosyncratic causes like exposure to latex (another ubiquitous substance in modern households). Removal of the offending substance from home environments and possibly immune support typically resolve this kind of eczema.\nI believe rosacea and psoriasis are probably infectious, and are a different subject altogether. There are also eczema-like rashes that can appear after acute illness; I\u2019ve heard of a few misdiagnosed initially as eczema. I think they go away relatively quickly without any intervention.\nSome integrative and natural medicine practitioners approach eczema by taking general steps to strengthen the immune system. Given my own feelings about what allergies are and aren\u2019t, I see it as a different approach that complements rather than conflicts with the above. When carrying too great a load, one can either lessen the load or strengthen the carrier. My approach is more the former, which I think is prudent even if one decides also to do the latter. Eczema and allergies can begin throughout life; I personally feel that the later they appear, the more warranted is attention to the overall health of the immune system.\n_top_\nPriobiotics Reduce Eczema in Some Cases\nRecent research on the use of probiotics (beneficial bacteria) has correlated probiotic use by pregnant woman and infants with a significant reduction in the prevalence of eczema and cow\u2019s milk allergy among at-risk infants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than 30% reduction in incidence of eczema.\nThere is a growing list of scientific publications on this topic which can be found on Pubmed by linking to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and searching on keywords \u201ceczema probiotics.\u201d\nFull text of newer articles isn\u2019t usually available in full, but I believe this one can be found on the web: Kalliomaki M, Salminen S, Arvilommi H, Kero P, Koskinen P, Isolauri E, Probiotics in primary prevention of atopic disease: a randomised placebo-controlled trial, Lancet 2001 Apr 7;357(9262):1076-9.\nThe above authors state that the probiotics used in their study are \u201csafe at an early age.\u201d\nAlthough I could cite other encouraging research on the use of probiotics in some disease prevention \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I think they are worth using for a lot of reasons \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I have my doubts that probiotic use has much impact on eczema in detergent-allergic children. And it so happens, on our doctor\u2019s recommendation (for other medical reasons), I used probiotics during pregnancy, and we supplemented with probiotics very early, and it had no apparent impact on my son\u2019s eczema.\nOn the other hand, it would be consistent with my own theory about the underlying cause of anaphylactic allergy that children at risk for developing anaphylactic food allergies and the systemic yeast/fungal type of eczema would benefit from (prenatal and possibly early) probiotic supplementation.\nUntil the 20th century, mothers passed beneficial bacteria to infants in an unbroken chain for thousands of years, as did dairy animals. From a recent review article on probiotics:\n\u201cMost probiotics fall into the group of organisms' known as lactic acid-producing bacteria and are normally consumed in the form of yogurt, fermented milks or other fermented foods. Some of the beneficial effect of lactic acid bacteria consumption include: (i) improving intestinal tract health; (ii) enhancing the immune system, synthesizing and enhancing the bioavailability of nutrients; (iii) reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance, decreasing the prevalence of allergy in susceptible individuals; and (iv) reducing risk of certain cancers.\u201d [Parvez S, Malik KA, Ah Kang S, Kim HY, Probiotics and their fermented food products are beneficial for health. J Appl Microbiol. 2006 Jun;100(6):1171-85.]\nResearch has demonstrated the important role of beneficial bacteria in human disease prevention. Antibiotics, for all the good they have done, wipe out the good bacteria with the bad. They were used for decades without much attention to restoring normal internal flora, in humans and dairy animals. When I was a child, 90% of babies were bottlefed with sterile milk. The chain was broken. It\u2019s truly not surprising that restoring normal bacteria to a child\u2019s milk would aid digestion and decrease the likelihood of dairy allergies and eczema in a certain population.\nSince these supplements are generally regarded as safe (so long as one is not allergic to anything in a particular formulation, most prominently, dairy or corn), they may be helpful as a part of a preventive approach for allergic kids, and they may be helpful in disease prevention (since children with eczema are more susceptible to certain kinds of infections). There is evidence that they support the immune system. I would personally take them in addition to a problem solving effort, not instead of. But in this case, the potential benefits appear to be great and according to the research, the risks low (unless, again, someone has a severe allergy to any of the ingredients). A probiotic supplement may be worth trying, per your pediatrician\u2019s recommendation.\n_top_\nEczema Prevention in Pregnancy and Early Infancy\nDr. T. Barry Brazelton (who no longer practices but teaches at Harvard Medical School) felt that he could prevent eczema in virtually all cases by identifying at-risk parents (when one parent had a history of allergy) and giving them simple allergy-reduction steps to follow during pregnancy. He points out that it's a lot easier to prevent problems than eliminate them after the allergy surfaces. This is where I first learned of the difference between soap and detergent, in his description of what to do in his book Touchpoints.\nIn his day, there were fewer sources of detergent in households, but even today the switch during pregnancy would be far simpler than after eczema surfaces. Preventive steps during pregnancy would mainly involve switching washing products. I would love to someday see a simple study done on this. I actually called Brazelton looking for citations, and he said he didn't have any research, he simply realized this from decades of medical practice.\nGiven his experience, plus recent research on probiotics and eczema, I would guess that following his simple allergy-reduction steps, eliminating detergents, and taking probiotics during pregnancy would prevent the vast majority of eczema cases in infants and small children.\n_top_\nAdult Allergies Are More Complex\nI don\u2019t want to discourage adults from trying to see if detergents cause their eczema \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I have in the past year received numerous letters from parents who cleared up a child\u2019s eczema by removing detergents from the household, only to discover that the measures also cleared up the skin problems of one or more adults in the household \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but adults have a wider range of experiences, health problems, and environmental exposures, and their skin problems can be more complex. Particularly for people whose eczema develops later in life rather than in infancy, I am skeptical that detergent sensitivity is the problem, though I stand to be corrected. There might be a rationale for reducing contact with products that increase membrane permeability as detergents do, but switching washing products has its risks as well. If anything, adults considering this switch need to be highly cautious in how they go about it.\nTHE DETECTIVE WORK\nDeciding that detergents are the main cause of eczema breakouts takes a great deal of work. It may be obvious to you from reading through this that your child has this problem, especially if the eczema is very severe. This section contains some general observations about breakouts, exposures, and the detective-work.\n1)\nThe breakouts follow certain rules, they aren\u2019t random. Figure out those rules, and the breakouts make sense.\n2)\nWork from general hypotheses, not from specifics that can\u2019t be generalized. Helpful hypothesis: my child may be allergic to latex in her pacifier, bottle supplies, clothing, mattresses, and other sources I haven\u2019t yet tracked down. (A testable theory.) Unhelpful hypothesis: my child\u2019s eczema flares after she sits in the car seat. (Maybe so, but why? This is a clue, not a hypothesis. Try to get a general theory that is consistent in all situations.)\n3)\nMake a list of probable causes and write it down!! Make a list of everything your child touches, eats, or breathes that you think could be causing the eczema. Try to form some helpful hypotheses as in #2, and write them down. Don\u2019t just make a mental note of everything, don\u2019t try to analyze and weed through the possibilities, just write them down. Once you have a list, arrange the causes with the most likely at the top. Then think of ways to eliminate or \u201ctest\u201d each probable cause. Write them down, too!\n4)\nWhen you try each \u201ctest\u201d, consider whether the test is good enough or well-implemented enough to draw conclusions from. If the test isn\u2019t good enough, think of more \u201ctests\u201d before drawing conclusions or throwing out the possible cause.\n5)\nObserve whether the rashes seem to be from something the baby is touching (for example, the eczema might be worse/better under the diaper area or clothing) or if it\u2019s from something the baby is eating (the rash might bloom after every meal or reliably 4 days after a certain food is eaten).\n6)\nTiming is important: what changed in the baby\u2019s life in the month, days, and hours prior to the first breakout? Add any new possible causes to the list!\n7)\nTiming is important! Contact-related rashes typically happen within a few minutes or hours of touching the irritant (remember that traces may then remain on the skin and continue to cause reactions). Ingestion-related rashes can happen quickly but they can also take up to a week to show up after the offending food or substance is eaten (in my experience, most things show up by the 4th day). If the offending food or substance is eaten again, the rash will persist; if not, it may still take another 4 days to a week for the rash to go away. If the rash becomes infected, it will likely not go away until the infection is treated.\n8)\nIn my experience, contact-related rashes occur on the skin where the contact occurs; ingestion-related rashes can occur anywhere, but they tend to happen in common spots (such as the upper arms or legs) and new breakouts tend to happen where the skin is already broken out. Because ingestion-related rashes tend to be more persistent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 provided one has a safe washing procedure to remove contact irritants so that contact-related rashes go away quickly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 ingestion-related rashes are therefore more susceptible to infection.\n9)\nBreakouts are proportional to exposure: big breakouts happen from big exposures to the offending allergen, small or delayed breakouts happen from smaller exposures. Mitigating factors such as a change in humidity could change the absolute measure, but the proportional relationship still holds.\n10)\nKeep a detailed diary of what the baby eats if foods are suspected, and what products are used on the skin and other household surfaces if contact rashes are suspected. Be exact \u00e2\u0080\u0094 dehydrated rice cereal is not the same as cooked brown rice is not the same as white rice porridge (white rice cooked for 2 hours in a lot of water). If a washing product is suspected, remember that there are traces left on surfaces no matter how much water was used for rinsing. In that case, rice cooked in soap-washed pots is not the same as rice cooked in detergent-washed pots. Canned pears are not the same as fresh pears are not the same as processed frozen pears.\n11)\nBe aware of ingredients. Allergens \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even food allergens like citrus and wheat protein \u00e2\u0080\u0094 may be found in soap or detergent dishwashing liquids and dishwasher powder.\n12)\nMinute traces of some allergens can cause severe breakouts. Whatever chemicals you last washed your child\u2019s clothing, skin, hair, bottles, etc., in \u00e2\u0080\u0094 traces of those chemicals significant enough to cause a reaction can remain on those surfaces in spite of Herculean rinsing with water.\n13)\nDifferentiate between what improves the eczema, and what makes it go away completely. Is dryness, for example, the cause, or a mitigating factor? If you think it is truly the cause, the breakouts will be absolutely proportional to dryness, and this can be quantified. If there proves to be no other variable, and moisturizing isn\u2019t enough to completely make the outbreaks go away, a naturopath, holistic allergist, or nutritionist may be able to recommend dietary changes to help hydrate the skin. If the breakouts continue, or don\u2019t track dryness absolutely, dryness may be a mitigating factor rather than a cause, and it may be worthwhile to continue searching.\n14)\nIt has been my observation that bottle fed babies are more likely to develop early, severe eczema, and eczema in breastfed babies often surfaces when breastfeeding tapers off (although it certainly can start during breastfeeding, especially if the cause is a food). If eczema begins as breastfeeding tapers off, it may be that the irritant has been present in the baby\u2019s environment all along \u00e2\u0080\u0094 breastfeeding tends to have a protective effect with \u201cnormal\u201d allergy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in this case, the clues from timing are a little different.\n15)\nSome clues can be misleading. For example, this detergent allergy can easily make it seem that foods are the cause of eczema, some foods more than others because of how they are processed, prepared, or served. Detergent sensitivity can behave exactly like multiple food allergies or dust-mite allergies. Skin allergy testing results could inadvertently reinforce a wrong conclusion.\n16)\nRemoving the allergen from one\u2019s environment is not linearly related to clearing the eczema, at least it wasn\u2019t for detergent exposure. You don\u2019t get 50% improvement by removing 50% of the allergen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 exposures don\u2019t quite work that way. If you remove 99% of the sources, but your child spends a few hours in contact with the one sheet or article of clothing you didn\u2019t wash in soap, you have a bad breakout to deal with. You pretty much have to get as close to 100% detergent-free as possible. But then if you have the right answer, the eczema will clear up as if a miracle has occurred.\n17)\nOnce you have cleared up the eczema entirely, it is possible to see how new breakouts make absolute sense relative to exposures.\n_top_\nYour Doctor has a Wealth of Knowledge and Experience\nWe gathered our list of possible causes from suggestions given by our pediatrician, naturopath, allergist, and from the most common allergens mentioned in parenting books (including Touchpoints). We consulted a pediatric nutritionist along the way, too.\nThe medical professionals we consulted may not have had the answer for us, but they imparted plenty of wisdom: they told us which kinds of allergens, from their experience, caused very bad cases of eczema; they gave us information, resources, ideas, and interpretations that proved invaluable.\nThey offered practical advice: our son\u2019s pediatrician, for example, clued us into the difference between barrier-type and emollient-type moisturizers, so that we were able to use the barrier-type moisturizers to help track down contact-related breakouts.\nAlthough our pediatrician suggested moisturizing and using cortisone (not a solution in our case), and the naturopath and allergist suggested such a severe allergy had to be from milk protein (which made no sense to us given the timing), everyone gave us a clear idea of what to expect with each suggestion, and that helped us define the problem. Our pediatrician was pragmatic about treating infections empirically, and this too proved invaluable. Had we needed it, the pediatric nutritionist could have outlined a safe allergy elimination diet for us.\nI can remember one watershed moment, after we had already switched to soap products for washing laundry and household surfaces. Our son was starting to eat solid foods, and he seemed to be allergic to everything. I called and spoke with our pediatrician\u2019s assistant. \u201cHe\u2019s allergic to pears!\u201d I wailed, \u201cWHO is allergic to PEARS!\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know that he\u2019s allergic to pears,\u201d she said, \u201call you know is that he\u2019s allergic to CANNED pears.\u201d She was absolutely right. It was as if a light went on in my head. I resolved to be as analytical about the situation as I needed to be to solve the problem completely.\nWe were blessed with professionals who were willing to give us the benefit of their knowledge and experience, trust our judgment, and talk over our concerns and anything we disagreed with. It made all the difference. Even though they did not have all the answers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 no one had the answer we needed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we benefited from their wisdom and help immensely. We could not have put the whole puzzle together without their help.\nIt is important to have a good relationship with experienced medical professionals when trying to solve a problem like this. They can help immensely even if they do not have all the answers. It is really essential to implement something this complicated in concert with a good medical professional. They can help sort through your individual situation from a trained perspective, ensure that everything is done safely, and respond to any problems that arise.\nThe NEASE web site has a wonderful slide show for professionals. Although it does not have this answer, the information compiled about eczema is consistent with this detergent sensitivity as one potential part of the puzzle. It\u2019s a great informational resource and worth watching. (I\u2019ve logged on many times when it wasn\u2019t working, if so, do send them email.)\n_top_\nEliminate Food Allergens, Too\nYou may wish to eliminate serious food allergens first before trying to eliminate detergents, or you won\u2019t know how much of an impact the detergent elimination has relative to food elimination.\nAccording to Dr. Sears, \"over 90 percent of food allergies, especially in young children, are caused by seven foods: dairy products, soy, shellfish, wheat, tree nuts, peanuts, egg whites.\u201d Corn, citrus, and tomatoes are also likely suspects \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially corn which is a hidden ingredient in so many processed foods.\nAllergy testing can be a helpful way of discerning food, pollen, mold, animal, and other allergies.\nOn that note, I feel I should weigh in on the blood vs. skin allergy testing issue. Please remember that this is just my layman\u2019s opinion, I am not a medical professional. Both the allergist and naturopathic doctors told me that allergy testing in infants before the immune system is mature is dicey and can be misleading. In my own experience, doctors who do skin allergy testing can be very convincing that skin testing is more reliable, and doctors who do blood testing are equally convincing that blood testing is just as good or better than skin testing. I have walked out of allergists offices completely convinced of one side or the other, depending on the preference of the allergist.\nThe big difference, in my opinion, is that skin allergy testing hurts. A lot. It just seems cruel to do such tests on infants and very young children, yet I have known any number of parents who have been talked into subjecting their babies to them. I\u2019m sure there must be exceptions out there, but of the people I know, not a one feels the skin tests were worth it. The performance of the tests depend on so many more human factors than the blood tests, the skin tests have more avenues for introducing errors and flaws. In the case of this detergent allergy, skin tests could be highly unreliable. One possible result is that the child reacts to virtually everything by skin test, but very few things by blood test.\n_top_\nA Test for Detergent-Reactivity?\nDetergent-reactive eczema is caused by how detergents affect skin membrane permeability and is not a true IgE-mediated allergy. In fact, very few people (if any) have a true allergy to detergents, most detergent allergies are actually allergies to product enzymes and additives. You could not test for detergent reactivity with traditional allergy blood tests.\nOne of the enduring puzzles in dermatology seems to be why skin patch testing and blood allergy testing often yield very different results. From what I gather by reading papers on the subject, I would guess that the tests would yield much more similar results if study subjects came from detergent-free households.\nA recent research article, which summarized patch test data for nearly 6000 patients, found that a reaction to a sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) patch test correlated with a \u201chigher skin susceptibility\u201d and greater \u201cskin irritability.\u201d SLS is the most common household detergent, and has been shown in other research to \u201cincrease antigen penetration.\u201d\n[Reference: H. Loeffler, D. Becker, J. Brasch, J. Geier, Simultaneous sodium lauryl sulphate testing improves the diagnostic validity of allergic patch tests. Results from a prospective multicentre study of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group, British Journal of Dermatology, vol. 152, Issue 4, Page 709, April 2005.]\nWhat these researchers call a \u201chigher skin susceptibility\u201d appears to be in the population which is most affected by detergents\u2019 effects on skin membrane permeability. The researchers\u2019 detailed description of the eczema in these patients is identical to detergent-reactive eczema.\nSome relevant quotes:\n\"...the degree of skin reaction depends on the concentration [of SLS]\"\n\"..in acute eczema (allergic, atopic or irritant eczema) reactions to patch tests can be much stronger, up to an 'angry back' reaction.\" (Note: a patch would create a more moist local environment, which would exponentially increase the detergent effect on membrane permeability, causing a reaction regardless of the allergen tested. I do not mean detergent on the patch, I mean traces in the skin which are likely causing the acute eczema in the first place.)\n\"... patients with an increased skin susceptibility (defined as a visible skin reaction to SLS) developed a higher rate of nonspecific erythematous reactions to several allergens.\"\n\"An increased skin reaction to SLS will decrease again ... after acute eczema has healed...\"\nIn plain English, if you react to an SLS patch test \u00e2\u0080\u0094 SLS being the most common household detergent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you are also more likely to react to many things by skin test that you aren't truly allergic to.\nOne of the features of this detergent-reactive eczema is that one may be positive to many things by skin test but few things by blood test. The apparent positive would come from detergent traces on the skin and the nonlinear increase in local skin membrane permeability from the increase in moisture at the test site (such as from the enclosed patch or fluid from a skin prick test in that case).\nThe research describes how, when the acute eczema of study subjects healed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in detergent-reactive eczema, that means detergent exposures are reduced \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the SLS reaction decreases again. In detergent-reactive eczema, the reactivity of the skin to a given detergent exposure decreases when the skin is allowed to heal and become normal away from persistent detergent exposures, and increases again in the presence of persistent exposures.\nMy conclusion from this very thorough research study is that an SLS patch test may be useful to identify someone with this detergent-reactive eczema. A clinical trial would have to be done to establish how specific an SLS reaction is to detergent-reactive eczema, in other words, how well a reaction to an SLS patch test identifies someone with this detergent-reactive eczema \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but I think the results of this study imply that the correlation would be good.\nSince sodium lauryl sulfate and similar surfactants are so ubiquitous in home environments today, it may be useful even now to talk to a doctor about an SLS patch test. If it is positive, these detergents removal steps will almost certainly help. Based on my reading of the above research, an 0.5% SLS patch test for 48 hours would be better than the 0.25% test.\nSince no research has been done on the specificity of this test for detergent-reactive eczema \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I have no idea of the safety considerations for infants, it\u2019s important to ask the dermatologist or allergist \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the results should be an informative guide but not regarded as definitive. No one yet knows the parameters for proper performance of such a test for this purpose.\n_top_\nHOW TO ELIMINATE THE DETERGENTS\nI received a large number of responses to my letter in the 2004 NEASE Advocate newsletter. (Download it from the Downloads page.) Many of the respondents had already been at the detective work for years, and just wanted to know how to implement this solution. Some people wrote asking for a \u201ctest\u201d or other clues to decide whether they had this sensitivity. The above numbered section on The Detective Work outlines some important general clues. Here are some specifics:\nPossible Signs of this Detergent Sensitivity:\nThe following signs are not necessarily unique to this sensitivity, but they may help identify it. Your baby/child may have a general detergent sensitivity if:\nHe gets eczema all over, but you use disposable diapers and the diaper area is relatively clear of eczema.\nHer eczema changes noticeably, either for better or worse, following a bath or shower.\nHis eczema sometimes seems to fluctuate wildly from day to day.\nWashing just with water can sometimes cause an outbreak.\nShe gets particularly bad eczema on her cheeks or chin where she rests it on your shoulder or against your hair when you hold her.\nHis pattern of eczema from foods is inconsistent or follows strange lines: he might seem allergic to cooked or canned foods but not to fresh ones, or he reacts more to cooked foods than to raw ones (if it\u2019s a protein allergy, it should logically be the other way around).\nHer eczema is worse on exposed skin, especially as she crawls around during the day.\nSweating makes the eczema markedly worse. Or the eczema is worse in areas that remain moist, such as behind the knees.\nHe reacts to just about everything on the allergy skin tests, yet his blood tests show very few allergies.\nHer eczema does seem related to what you are using to wash her or the laundry with, but switching products has maybe improved it but never made it go away.\nHe seems to get eczema from just about everything he touches and eats.\nHis eczema improved after infancy, but you just can\u2019t seem to make it go away. After the eczema started getting better, the asthma symptoms started up.\n_top_\nA Simple \u201cTest\u201d\nImportant note (July 2007): I used to recommend unscented Dove for this test. As of January 2007, the makers of unscented Dove have discontinued the product and changed the surfactant formula in unscented Dove Sensitive Skin. Until further notice, I cannot recommend unscented Dove Sensitive Skin at all. Most especially, do not use it for the washing test. I am searching for an equivalent replacement. Until I can find one, use Cal Ben's liquid dishglow from a foaming dispenser. DO NOT USE IT STRAIGHT AS IT IS QUITE CONCENTRATED. As always, test on a small area first for individual sensitivities. For more information about the changes to unscented Dove, see my blog www.solveeczema.wordpress.com .\nI have suggested the following to some people as a simple \u201ctest\u201d to judge whether more \u201ctests\u201d or work are warranted. It is not foolproof. People can be allergic to anything; if one has a specific allergic to any of these products, the results will be misleading. If the eczema is infected it won\u2019t clear up even if this is the answer. This test will only affect contact-related eczema (eczema from touching the irritating substance), it will not affect ingestion-related eczema (eczema from eating the irritating substance).\nThe principle here is to remove all detergent residues from the skin and coat it with a thick layer of a barrier moisturizer long enough for the skin to start healing. This \u201ctest\u201d will allow the skin a few hours\u2019 relief, enough to see a difference in contact-related eczema. If one has this detergent allergy, emollient moisturizers will make things worse and should be avoided for this test. Detergents are so ubiquitous in our environments, and so persistent in human tissue, water alone will not be sufficient to remove them.\nThe washing product I recommend for removing the detergent residues for this test is Cal Ben's liquid dishglow from a foaming dispenser. Do not use it straight as it is quite concentrated. Rinse especially well.\nRemember that some residues of anything you use will be sealed in by the barrier moisturizer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if you have any concerns, consult your doctor and if necessary, start with a small area as a test for individual allergy to the soap ingredients or the Aquaphor.\nSUBSTITUTING A DETERGENT PRODUCT FOR THIS TEST IS NOT OKAY, EVEN IF THE DETERGENT IS COMBINED WITH OILS. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE WITH A DETERGENT PRODUCT LIKE CETAPHIL, EVEN IF IT IS CONSIDERED \u201cHYPOALLERGENIC\u201d. Cetaphil is a great product for someone like me who is not allergic to detergent. But it is a problem for someone with this detergent allergy. One mother I was trying to help used Cetaphil without telling me, and her child\u2019s skin blistered. Use only a good cleansing soap for the purposes of this test.\nBarrier moisturizers include Aquaphor and Vaseline Petroleum Jelly. One person responded to my letter in the NEASE Advocate by making a general recommendation for a product he manufactures called Hydrolatum, which appears to be a benign barrier moisturizer as well, though I have no experience with it myself.\nEucerin (made by the Eucerin company, which also makes Aquaphor) is NOT the same as Aquaphor and is NOT a barrier moisturizer for the purposes of this test.\nPlease be aware that words for moisturizer categories are non-standard and even contradictory. Some researchers in the UK have published papers touting \"emollient\" moisturizers as best for eczema sufferers; the specific types of products they mean are the same as I describe as \"barrier\" moisturizers.\nThe Washing Test/Washing Procedure:\nPlease read through the entire washing procedure before starting; safety in the bathroom comes first. If it\u2019s not possible to follow these instructions safely, another option is to wash a cup for rinsing, or the bathroom surfaces, or anything else as necessary, with soap, and rinse well. Cal Ben's liquid dish soap (straight) works well for removing detergents from hard surfaces. Rinse well, it is quite concentrated.\nThe best time to do this test is in the evening just before your child goes to bed, because s/he will be less active.\nFirst wash your hands well with the Cal Ben's dish soap foam. Rinse them well under the tap. Dry them only with new paper towels such as Bounty, not with fabric towels. Try to take the paper towels right off the roll, don\u2019t set them on a flat, washed surface.\nIf your child gets eczema on his/her lower arms or legs, wash one arm or leg well with the Cal Ben foam (using your hands or paper towel, not a washcloth). Rinse the arm or leg well under the tap only, not in a bath or sink. Do not use a container to pour the water. Use the water directly out of the tap and use your hands if necessary to direct it. Do not let the skin touch the sides of the sink or tub. If that happens, wash and rinse the skin again.\nDry only with paper towels. Do not allow the washed skin to contact anything (especially not your clothing) before slathering it with a thick layer of a barrier moisturizer like Aquaphor. If you have a used tub of this moisturizer, be sure to scrape off a layer of it with your soap-washed hands before using it so that no residues of detergents from past use have made it into the mix.\nImmediately following this procedure, the bumps or skin may look a little redder for a short while, even if the procedure is helping, but the redness should go away fairly quickly. The skin should not start to break out, and it shouldn\u2019t hurt or itch more. If your child experiences a bad reaction of any kind, immediately wash everything off with whatever you normally use and call your doctor. (I\u2019m not expecting a reaction, but as I said, people can be allergic to anything.)\nIf the procedure is helping, the eczema should look improved within as little as a half hour. If your child\u2019s eczema in the test area looks markedly different after a few hours, then there is a good possibility that a contact reaction to detergents is involved; it\u2019s a virtual certainty that a contact reaction of some sort is involved.\nIf your child\u2019s eczema doesn\u2019t look different at all, it could be because the eczema is ingestion-related rather than contact-related, or because it is infected and will have to be treated before it will go away.\nIf the eczema on the tested areas virtually disappears with this test \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least for a few hours \u00e2\u0080\u0094 then making the switch to soaps will probably help. If this \u201ctest\u201d works well, then this washing procedure will help whenever contact rashes appear from unknown sources outside the home. We\u2019ve brought our son home covered in eczema from contact with the dentist\u2019s chair or other people\u2019s clothing, and the breakouts quite literally wash off. Even a bad breakout is usually gone completely within the hour when it\u2019s washed. I\u2019ve heard this from other people I\u2019ve helped, too, that you can almost see the eczema wash away. (Once you have soap-washed towels and bathroom surfaces, this washing procedure gets a little easier.)\n_top_\nSWITCHING TO SOAPS\nThe most commonly asked question of people who responded to my letter in the NEASE Advocate was: where do I find soap products?! I put a list at the end of this discussion. I tried to include as many different kinds of soap and non-detergent products as I could; I have not used all of them, and I am not endorsing any of them. It\u2019s always possible that I have overlooked a detergent ingredient in a product I have not used; I tried to be careful, but these days even very thorough research isn\u2019t always enough. Please read the entire discussion before making any changes. Be aware that sometimes companies will switch ingredients without warning. It pays to be aware of the developments in surfactant chemistry and labeling to know what you are using.\n_top_\nA Brief History of Cleaning Products\nThe Soap and Detergent Association (SDA) has a nice web site at http://www.sdahq.org/cleaning/soaps_and_detergents.html . The site includes information about the history of soaps and detergents, and some basic chemistry. The history of soaps and detergents is well worth reading, especially the last section that describes the introduction of new detergent cleaning products by decade in the 20th Century.\nSoaps and detergents are both surfactants. They are similar, but not the same. Humans have made soaps for thousands of years, by reacting fats or oils with alkaline substances, such as ashes or soda ash.\nDetergents are an invention of the 20th century. From the Soap and Detergent Association (SDA) web site http://www.sdahq.org/cleaning/history/soaphistory3.html :\n\u201cHousehold detergent production in the United States began in the early 1930s, but did not really take off until after World War II. The war-time interruption of fat and oil supplies as well as the military's need for a cleaning agent that would work in mineral-rich sea water and in cold water had further stimulated research on detergents.\u201d\nThe web site further defines detergents thusly: \u201c\u2026synthetic detergents are non-soap washing and cleaning products that are \u00e2\u0080\u0098synthesized\u2019 or put together chemically from a variety of raw materials. The discovery of detergents was also driven by the need for a cleaning agent that, unlike soap, would not combine with the mineral salts in water to form an insoluble substance known as soap curd.\u201d\nDetergents can be synthesized from many different kinds of starting ingredients, but were mainly developed from petroleum. In developing something similar to soaps, the aim was also to overcome the shortcomings of soaps \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to make something that would work over a broader range of water mineral conditions and temperature extremes.\nSoaps and detergents thus historically differed both in their starting ingredients and in the chemical properties of the end result.\nInitially, the general public distinguished soaps and detergents only by their starting ingredients: surfactants made from plant and animal fats were called soaps, surfactants made from petroleum were called detergents. Especially during the times of fat and oil shortages, it was a valid distinction. To this day, many people still distinguish soaps from detergents this way.\nBy the SDA definition, however, detergents can be made from other ingredients. In today\u2019s climate, petroleum derivatives have lost favor with consumers of \u201cnatural\u201d products. Manufacturers have filled the niche with a plethora of products synthesized from non-petroleum starting ingredients \u00e2\u0080\u0094 considered more \u201cnatural\u201d by some \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and which work better in hard water than soap.\nBy the SDA definition, such products could be considered plant-based detergents, especially where they have different washing and molecular charge properties than traditional soap. But because of the long-standing public understanding of soaps and detergents as differentiated by their starting ingredients, many of these manufacturers justifiably call these products \u201cnon-detergent\u201d or \u201csoap-based.\u201d\nFor the purpose of switching from detergents to soaps to eliminate this eczema, most of these plant-based surfactants would be considered detergents, not soaps. Unfortunately, the confusion in definitions makes an already difficult hunt for true soaps even harder.\nI think this is one reason more people haven\u2019t figured this difference out today as Dr. Brazelton did in his practice.\n_top_\nIf You Make the Switch, Stick With Traditional Soaps\nIf you are trying to make this switch from detergents to soaps, use only traditional soaps. Products that contain soap will say \u201csoap\u201d as the first ingredient on the INGREDIENTS label. All-soap-based products will not have further \u201cnonionic vegetable-based surfactants\u201d or other non-soap surfactants listed in the ingredients.\nIt is possible that a manufacturer could list a soap ingredient as a \u201cvegetable-based surfactant.\u201d If the manufacturer otherwise advertises that the product is a soap product (as opposed to a detergent), follow up with questions. Ask point blank: is this product a traditional anionic soap? In my experience, sometimes it is, most of the time it is not.\nIn one case, the maker applied the historic distinction between soaps and detergents, and claimed in an email that their product was a soap product, even when it was clear from the label that it was a combination of a soap and a nonionic vegetable-based surfactant, clearly not all traditional soap.\n_top_\nThe word \u201csoap\u201d means absolutely nothing on the FRONT label of the product and is commonly used for detergent products. Even organic or \u201cnatural\u201d products that say \u201csoap\u201d on the FRONT label are often all detergent and contain no soap.\nSome products on the market are a combination of traditional soap and \u201cnonionic vegetable-based surfactants.\u201d I do not know if these products are okay for children with this allergy. I suspect that some of them may be, particularly if the nonionic surfactant is a minor ingredient relative to the soap, but I would not recommend trying them initially because the effect is unknown. If you clear up the eczema by making the entire switch, you can always experiment with new products later. But this switch is so much work and fraught with so many pitfalls as it is, I would not personally recommend adding an unknown like a combination product to start.\nMany cleaning products on the natural-store shelves are made from 100% nonionic vegetable-based surfactants. I do not know if these products are okay for children with this allergy. I strongly suspect that they are not. I would consider them detergents for the purposes of this allergy. Parenthetically, a spokesperson from Nikwak pointed out that their company deliberately does not use nonionic vegetable-based surfactants in the soap washes they make for waterproof high-tech outdoor fabrics.\nWater conditioners like Borax or Oxo-brite are not detergents and are okay so long as one does not have an individual allergy to them. I use them in addition to soap, not instead of. Many soap-based washing products contain other ingredients to boost the efficacy of soap, which is okay, again, so long as one does not have an individual allergy to the ingredients.\nEven if you do everything by the book, and your child\u2019s eczema proves to be caused only by detergents, you will probably still have detective work to clear the eczema 100%. Be diligent and don\u2019t guess. If you want to make this switch and have any concerns that something MIGHT not be traditional soap, don\u2019t use it. Stick with what you know.\nSoaps do a marvelous job of cleaning in soft water; in my personal opinion, the result with soaps is better than from detergents in soft water. But since the introduction of detergents, which work over a broader range of water conditions, home water softeners have become rare. Absent soft water, consumers complain that soaps don\u2019t work as well, and stopped using them. At the end of the 20th century, true soap flake makers began to pull their products from supermarket shelves. Ivory Snow, once the premier soap flake for baby clothing, became a detergent about ten years ago. White King stopped selling soap flakes in stores around 1998. I do not know of any traditional grocery or natural foods chain that sells true soap flakes anymore in the United States, though they can be found in markets in countries like France and England. I have a provided a list of online sources in the List of Products .\n_\n\u201cNatural\u201d and \u201cHypoallergenic\u201d Hype\nSome soap products can be harsh and drying; many fine soap products are not. Finding them is the trick. Many baby books recommend \u201csuperfatted soaps\u201d for babies.\nBe aware of advertising hype as you try to locate products. Consumers Union sponsors a site to explain labeling terms http://www.eco-labels.org/home.cfm .\nOne term you can completely ignore here is \u201chypoallergenic.\u201d According to the eco-labels site, \u201cThere is no government or official definition for this term.\u201d According to the evaluation by Consumers Union, \u201cThe hypoallergenic label is not meaningful.\u201d And \u201c\u2026the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that \u00e2\u0080\u0098There are no federal standards or definitions that govern the use of the term \u00e2\u0080\u0098hypoallergenic\u2019. In 1974, the FDA tried to establish definitions for the use of the term hypoallergenic, but the regulation was overturned in court. Manufacturers of cosmetics labeled as hypoallergenic are not required to submit substantiation of their hypoallergenicity claims to the FDA.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cThe FDA \u00e2\u0080\u0098does not know of any scientific studies done to see if \u00e2\u0080\u0098hypoallergenic\u2019 products produce fewer allergic reactions than those that don\u2019t have the claim.\u2019 The same is true for the terms \u00e2\u0080\u0098dermatologist-tested,\u2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0098sensitivity tested,\u2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0098allergy tested\u2019 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098nonirritating.\u201d\nThe term \u201cnatural\u201d is no more helpful. \u201cThere is no government or official definition for this term except on meat and poultry products.\"\nImportant Points\nSwitching to soaps is a lot of work.\nClearing up eczema by removing the detergent exposures in the environment is not a linear process. You don\u2019t get 50% improvement by removing 50% of the sources, exposures don\u2019t work that way. If you remove 99% of the sources, but your child spends a few hours in contact with the one sheet or article of clothing you didn\u2019t wash in soap, you have a bad breakout to deal with.\nYou have to get as close to 100% removal of all sources of contact as possible to eliminate the eczema.\nIf you are willing to do the work, and this is the problem, the results are nothing short of miraculous. If you aren\u2019t willing to do the work, it\u2019s probably not worth the effort to do it half way, because you probably won\u2019t even see half improvement.\nOn the other hand, the reactions are proportional. Two hours spent in contact with a fabric washed in a strong detergent will cause worse eczema than two hours spent in contact with a fabric washed in a mild detergent. This is why, for example, someone with this allergy might see an improvement using a mild detergent like Dreft, yet fail to eliminate the eczema.\nTo get 100% removal of all sources, at least at the start, everyone in the household should make the switch if feasible.\nYour child spends time in contact with you and your clothing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if you don\u2019t make the switch she will be exposed to detergents every time she touches you. Your clothing, skin, and hair will continue to leave detergents in the household dust from lint, skin cells, etc. Combining soap and detergent laundry products in the wash is problematic, and detergent residues in the dryer will have to be constantly washed out rather than once at the start. It\u2019s better if everyone switches, provided everyone tolerates the switch. You can always experiment with changes once the eczema is cleared up.\nOne of the things that I remember from working in chemistry labs (before studying engineering) is how incredibly difficult it is to remove all residues of anything from any surface. Detergents can be very persistent. Think of nothing as clean; _top_ think of everything as coated in a layer of whatever it was last washed in at the very least. For the purposes of someone who is very allergic, you can\u2019t really wash anything completely away with water. You can only find things that don\u2019t cause the rashes to wash away the things that do.\nDon\u2019t assume anything is detergent-free unless you\u2019ve removed the detergent yourself (with soap).\nThere are grades of detergent strengths.\nThe stronger detergents seem to be a greater problem for children with this allergy. All are a problem for children with this allergy if you want to make the eczema go away rather than just improve it. Many detergent products are mislabeled as \u201csoap\u201d, but you can tell the difference by reading ingredients.\nOne chemist told me that many detergents have a chemical name that resembles sodium lauryl sulfate, i.e., \u201csodium [something something something] \u00e2\u0080\u0093ate\u201d. The chemical names will start with sodium or potassium. This is not true of all detergents by any means. When in doubt, check with the manufacturer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 ask if any of the ingredients are classified as detergents. The online dictionary www.thefreedictionary.com is another good resource for checking the classification of some chemicals. The National Institutes of Health and the National Library of Medicine sponsor a site http://householdproducts.nlm.nih.gov/index.htm . You can type in the names of household products or the chemical names and get a flood of information about them, such as the entire ingredients list. If you find a chemical using the search function, click on the link to chemical information. Once there, click on the \u201cFull Record\u201d link on the left side of the page. You won\u2019t find \u201cthis is a soap\u201d or \u201cthis is a detergent\u201d stated explicity, but the information is usually in there somewhere.\nThe Environmental Working Group http://www.ewg.org has a cosmetics database with thousands of personal care and household products. For every product, there is a list of ingredients and specifics about each ingredient. These entries should say whether an ingredient is a detergent/surfactant.\nExamples of names of common detergents (there are far too many to list):\nsodium lauryl sulfate/sodium dodecyl sulfate\nsodium laureth sulfate\nammonium xylene-sulfonate\ncocomide monoethanolamide\nTraditional soaps are anionic. \u201cNonionic vegetable-based surfactants\u201d are not traditional soap, even if they have been made with plant-based fats.\nHowever, some of the plant-based soap/nonionic surfactant combination products may prove to be okay for this allergy, I don\u2019t know. I would not start with these or any of the 100% nonionic products. Once you clear up the eczema, you can switch products one at a time to see if they are okay. Many detergents that cause this eczema, like sodium lauryl sulfate, are anionic like soap\u00e2\u0080\u0094 the molecular charge is not the deciding variable here \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but knowing soaps are anoinic can help you avoid compounds that are not traditional soap.\nTrue soap is a premium ingredient. While manufacturers have many vague or complex terms for detergents, such as \"nonionic surfactants,\" soaps are a very specific product that can be identified on ingredient labels much more easily. There may be legal reasons for this, too. A product is a true soap if the INGREDIENTS label says:\n\"soap\"\n\"saponified [oil]\", e.g., saponified olive oil (which is castile soap)\n\"castile soap\", which is one of the most common soaps\nsimple chemical names for soap, e.g. sodium cocoate (soap from olive oil, or castile soap), sodium tallowate (soap from tallow), sodium palmate, etc. Soaps can also be made with potassium hydroxide, in which case, for example, soap from olive oil would be \"potassium olivate\".\nTraces of detergents significant enough to cause severe eczema persist in clothing in spite of Herculean rinsing. An extra rinse or two is nothing with this allergy. Traces of detergents stay on dish surfaces despite repeated rinsing with water.\nFragrances are not the issue either, though they are common irritants; the problem here is the detergent. Fragrance-free detergent is not the solution here.\nThis solution is a great deal of work at the outset, but it does get better.\nOn balance, I felt it was easier to take steps to prevent the eczema than to cope with the problems caused by it. Once we eliminated the eczema, our son\u2019s skin became stronger and less fragile. Once it healed and wasn\u2019t broken out all the time, it was less susceptible to breakouts from dry contact with detergent-washed surfaces.\nWet contact with detergent-washed surfaces \u00e2\u0080\u0094 contact in the presence of water \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is a more serious problem than dry contact.\nThis is why sweating causes someone with this allergy to break out. (Fortunately, if detergent sensitivity is the cause, the sweating outbreaks can literally be washed away by the above washing \u201ctest\u201d procedure, as can virtually all contact-related eczema.)\nInfected patches have to be treated before they will go away.\nBacterial problems may be obvious, but for the most part, fungal problems are hard to diagnose and have to be treated empirically. Having a good pediatrician or dermatologist who is experienced and willing to work with you is key. Be alert for antimicrobial products containing ingredients that cause breakouts. Try to find ones that don\u2019t cause breakouts (of the ones we\u2019ve used, only a few did, most did not). When the antimicrobials caused breakouts themselves, in our experience, neither the infection nor the eczema cleared.\nIn my experience, tallow soaps give the best results and are the least drying.\nVegetarians should take care as tallow can come from animal fats. In fact, I thought all tallow came from animal fats, but the soap we use from Cal-Ben Soap Company lists ingredients as \u201cvegetable-based tallow\u201d or from \u201cvegetable tallow oil.\u201d If the source of the oils is important to you, please double check with the manufacturer.\nI\u2019m sorry to say this, but if you don\u2019t have access to your own washing machine and dryer, I don\u2019t know how to advise this switch.\nMachines at a Laundromat would have such high levels of detergents in them, I personally couldn\u2019t see a way to realistically use them for the purposes of switching to soaps. Combining soap and detergent laundry products in the wash can be a bigger problem than the detergents alone. (More on this later.)\n_top_\nSoaps Work Better In Soft Water\nSoaps work better in soft water than hard water. In my experience, soaps are superior to detergents in soft water. But they don\u2019t work well at all in hard water. That is one advantage of detergents, although they don\u2019t work as well in soft water (in my opinion), they work better over a greater range of water conditions than do soaps. A good site for understanding basic surfactant chemistry is http://www.cleaning101.com/cleaning/soaps_and_detergents.html .\nIf you have very hard water, soaps may not work well enough to remove detergent residues, and they won\u2019t work well for cleaning. Soaps form scum in hard water.\nMost people underestimate how big an impact water hardness has on their ability to wash anything and on their skin. Hard water by itself does a poor job of rinsing, whether it\u2019s soaps or detergents. Recent medical studies from England demonstrate that the incidence of eczema in areas with hard water is greater than the incidence in areas with soft water. [Atopic eczema and domestic water hardness, NJ McNally, et al, Lancet. 1998 Aug 15;352(9127):527-31.] If you have very hard water, my suggestion would be to install a mechanical water softener. You can use chemical softening agents like Borax, but having a mechanical softener works much better.\nIf you have hard water, the transition to soft water is an adjustment. All surfactants foam better in soft water, so you use far less to wash hair, dishes, laundry. At first it seems harder to get things clean, until you realize it\u2019s only because of superior sudsing. When you realize that all of those residues remained in your hair and clothing with hard water, and that the feeling you associated with \u201cclean\u201d was really the friction from unwashed residues, then you appreciate how much cleaner you are with soft water!\nIt is possible to get by without a softener if you have medium water, but if you have hard water, it may be necessary to get a mechanical softener to make this switch to soaps.\n_top_\nRemoving Detergents From Your Home and Your Child\u2019s Skin\nEverything in your home that has been washed is covered with detergent, unless you went out of your way to use soaps. Assume new clothing, fabrics, and stuffed animals have detergent residues in them.\n_top_\nStep 1: Get a good vacuum. Seriously.\nThe household dust contains detergent residues. If you don\u2019t already have a good HEPA or electrostatically filtered vacuum, get one, preferably with a hose attachment for dusting surfaces. Be sure to get a high quality one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I know about at least one cheaper product that leaked the air around the electrical cord without filtering it.\nMiele makes very good vacuums, but there are many others. Having a household air filter is not the same thing, the vacuum is essential for removing detergent dusts from carpets and other surfaces. In this case, dusting by vacuuming is the way to go, not wiping with a wet rag!! You may have to change the filters more often than recommended by the manufacturers, especially if you use electrostatic filters.\nKeep up the vacuuming throughout the detergent removal process. Once you\u2019ve made the switch completely, your dust won\u2019t contain detergents anymore and you can reduce the vacuuming to whatever level you need for general allergy control. It may be impossible to remove enough residues from fabric floor coverings, but in my experience, low levels of detergents can come off of nylon carpeting over time just from vacuuming.\nChildren who get severe eczema like this generally have other allergic susceptibilities. A vacuum with an adequate filter is an important allergy control measure.\n_top_\nStep 2: Superwash the laundry.\nFabrics that have been washed in detergent have stubborn traces of detergents in them, often high levels of detergents if they have been washed many times. Most people with eczema use the extra rinse cycle, but it\u2019s really nothing when it comes to this allergy.\nIt\u2019s necessary to do extra washing at the start to remove detergents residues in fabrics. This is such a difficult but important step, it\u2019s a good idea to sequester the things that have already been superwashed in soap. New clothing and towels have detergent residues in them usually, but it\u2019s far less than the clothing most people already have. Once you have removed the detergent residues entirely, you will be able to wash everything normally with soap.\nAgain, it\u2019s not a good idea to just wash the baby\u2019s things in soap and everyone else\u2019s in detergent. Don\u2019t mix the two, make the switch entirely until you see the results.\nAs I have tried to help other people with this allergy, I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to completely remove detergent residues with soaps, or the intermediate stage with residues of both can actually be more irritating. (A microbiologist who understands detergent chemistry has offered me an explanation for this, but I will have to ask about it a few more times before I understand it well enough to pass along.)\nI wish I could give exact advice for superwashing the clothing, but I don\u2019t have all the answers. When I get hand-me-down clothes from other people, sometimes I have to wash them ten or more times in soap before I get enough detergent residues out that my son stops reacting to them. (Water alone in this case would be hopeless.) Don\u2019t despair, though, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to do that much washing in all cases.\nIt\u2019s even more difficult to remove residues from some synthetics than cottons, so my suggestion would be to start only with 100% cotton clothing and fabrics. This summer, for example, my son wore some hand-me-down cotton shirts that had been washed many times and didn\u2019t seem to give him any trouble. But when it got hot and he sweated, he got a ring of eczema around the collar area \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it turns out, the synthetic combinations in the collars don\u2019t have to be labeled, and they hang onto the detergent residues better. I knew this was contact eczema because it \u201cwashed off\u201d using the washing procedure outlined previously. When I washed the shirts several times more with soap, they no longer caused the eczema where the collars touched my son\u2019s skin, even when the weather was very hot.\nProducts like Borax, Oxo-brite, or old-fashioned washing soda (Arm and Hammer sells one) can help boost the efficacy of the soap flakes. Vinegar might help remove residues, but use it alone, don\u2019t use it with the soap; vinegar lowers the pH, soap works better at higher pH. Vinegar in the laundry can make blue dyes run, don\u2019t use it with blue and purple fabrics. I\u2019ve never used vinegar with soft water, I suspect it\u2019s not necessary.\nWhat I suggest to people at a minimum to start is this: wash the laundry once or twice with soap flakes and a booster like Borax or Oxo-brite, then do one more full wash cycle with just soap, then do at least two more wash cycles with just water (nothing added). Use the prewash and extra rinse cycles each time if available.\nBefore drying the first soap-washed load, wash the detergent residues out of the dryer the best you can. Again, I don\u2019t have any exact advice to give, just don\u2019t use detergent-washed rags, and don\u2019t expect water alone to do the job. One possibility might be to use a true soap dishsoap product to wash out the detergent and fabric softener residues, then rinse very, very well with soap-washed rags. (That works nicely if your first load of superwashed fabrics is a load of rags!)\nRemember to wash any laundry room surfaces on which you set the clothing with soap (preferably a good dish soap \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but be careful, these are the most frequently mislabeled when they are actually detergent). Also, wash your laundry basket the first time as well. Don\u2019t take anything for granted, every detergent exposure could affect the outcome.\nDo not use fabric softeners. If your laundry comes out so hard that you think you can\u2019t live without them, your water is probably too hard for effective cleaning with soap. Once the laundry has been superwashed, and the eczema eliminated, it may be possible to reintroduce a liquid fabric softener, using extreme caution with the ingredients. I wouldn\u2019t recommend adding back a softener, but some people feel it\u2019s necessary. Do not use a fabric softener during the superwashing process, it makes the detergent residues harder to remove and may be an independent source of allergy problems as well.\n_top_\nA note on fabric flammability and soaps/detergents:\nI know very little about this topic, but since it is a safety issue, I will simply pass along what I have read or been told.\nSome clothing, especially polyester children\u2019s clothing, specifies on the label that it should be washed in detergent, i.e., not soap, because the flame retardant properties are affected. Polyester is now the standard for flame retardant children\u2019s clothing. When Ivory Snow switched from being a soap product to a detergent product, a company spokesperson admitted to me that this was one reason, probably over potential liability concerns.\nI wrote the American Fiber Manufacturers Association (AFMA) about this issue, and this was the response:\nAs for the effects of soap on fabric flammability, the major effect comes from the calcium and other metal ions left on the fabric. The effect is, of course, more pronounced when using hard water. The calcium interacts with the fatty acids that make up the soap. This interaction can form insoluble soap residues that may remain on the fabric. If there is sufficient buildup of this residue, the fabrics may become easier to ignite and may burn more easily. This can happen with virtually all types of fabrics - natural and synthetic.\nMost detergents are made up of materials that do not form insoluble calcium salts, so there is less of an effect. Calcium salts can still build up and affect fabric flammability, but the residues do not contain the fatty acids and usually produce a smaller effect on the fabric's burning characteristics.\nWhile these effects can be clearly demonstrated in laboratory tests, such as the test required for children's sleepwear, they are not something that most consumers would ever notice. Fabrics washed in soap or detergent can be safely worn as long as reasonable safety precautions are observed. All fabrics will burn under the proper circumstances and should always be protected from potential ignition sources.\nIt may be another reason to get a mechanical water softener (which removes calcium) if one plans to use soap for the long term. I do not know the implications of using soap and soft water and whether that solves this problem or not.\nThe government standards for flame-retardant children\u2019s clothing also include snug-fitting cotton clothing.\n_top_\nStep 3: Wash all household surfaces with soap and rinse using running water when possible, and soap-washed rags or towels if not \u00e2\u0080\u0094 chairs, tables, counters, sinks, floors, high chairs, etc. Don't forget the baby equipment like strollers, playpens, etc.\nFrom this point on, use soap rather than detergent products to wash household surfaces. Disinfectants like pure bleach are not detergents, though they can be irritating unless properly removed. Vinegar is an effective household cleaning agent, as is borax. If you decide to use disinfectants like Lysol cleaner that contain detergents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I do sometimes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just be sure to wash the same surfaces well with soap to remove the detergents after disinfection. (Do not mix any of these products together.) Soap should be sufficient for most household cleaning.\nIf your child takes a bath in a tub used by the rest of the family, you will have to scrub it well with soap to remove all detergent residues. Virtually all shampoos these days are detergent products. Even tiny traces remaining on surfaces can cause severe eczema. Exposure to detergents in the presence of water is a much more serious problem than dry exposure. It is essential to be fastidious about removing detergent residues from bathroom surfaces and completely switching to soaps, or be religious about washing off the detergents before every use by your child.\nFor surfaces you cannot wash with soap, such as a sofa or stroller seat that cannot be washed, it may help to put a layer between your child and the surfaces, such as laying down a soap-washed sheet or baby blanket. Just a warning \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one layer may not be enough. My son got some eczema through three layers of fabric \u00e2\u0080\u0094 fabrics are not impermeable \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we had to wash the stroller seat in soap to keep him from reacting.\n_top_\nStep 4: Wash all the dishes, pots, pans, utensils, and all other food preparation gear with true dish soap or in the dishwasher with non-detergent dishwashing powder.\nIt is not necessary to superwash hard surfaces like dishes, but rinsing with water alone is not enough. Use a dish soap to remove dish detergent residues.\nBefore you start, be sure to throw away the old sponge that contains detergent residues, and use only soap-washed kitchen towels or paper towels from now on. I think new sponges may contain detergent surfactants, try to \u201cwash\u201d them out with soap. The dried sponges from Trader Joe\u2019s are probably a good bet \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this is just a guess, but my suspicion would be that the detergents in new sponges are there to keep them soft (detergents are highly hydrophilic and don\u2019t dry out easily), therefore the dried, super-compacted sponges probably don\u2019t have a lot of detergent in them if they have any at all.\nThis is probably the easiest step, it just requires throwing away the old sponge and switching to a true dish soap and non-detergent dishwashing powder, and making sure everything used from that point on has been washed in soap.\nStep 5: Change all personal care products to non-detergent, including toothpaste.\nStep 6: Make bath time an eczema-removal time\nYou will still come into contact with detergents outside the home. As your child\u2019s skin heals, it will withstand these contacts better, but you will still need to remove them on a regular basis.\nThere are different theories about bathing when it comes to eczema. Some doctors think bathing and moisturizing every day is important for hydration. Some doctors think it causes dry skin and suggest bathing as infrequently as possible.\nWe came to the conclusion, for our son at least, that bathing every day was too drying. While it removed the detergent residues, it also made his skin more susceptible to outbreaks from lower levels of detergents.\nWe also came to the conclusion that washing only once a week wasn\u2019t enough, because the detergent exposures needed more frequent removal to keep the skin healed.\nBathing twice a week, or every other day in summer, is probably a good balance, at least it was for us. We didn\u2019t plan the baths on a schedule, rather we tended to bathe after major exposures every few days. Scheduling baths after play or visits outside the home that bring your child into contact with detergent-washed surfaces is a good contact-eczema control measure. If your child attends preschool and comes home every day with a contact rash, bathing every day is probably unavoidable, just be sure to wash with a true, cleansing soap (like Cal Ben's liquid dish soap from a foaming dispenser), rinse well, dry with your soap-washed towels, and coat the clean skin with Aquaphor or another barrier moisturizer immediately after. As the skin becomes stronger and the home more and more free of detergents, the Aquaphor may become unnecessary, especially in the summer.\nBefore applying barrier moisturizers, use the washing procedure to clean skin of any detergent residues that may have accumulated during the day. If you cover the skin with a barrier moisturizer, you seal in whatever is underneath, and a reaction will follow if your child\u2019s dry skin has any detergent dusts on the surface. The dry skin may not react, but once you put the barrier moisturizer over it, the skin becomes more moist and permeable under the barrier, and thus more susceptible to any trapped detergent residues.\nBathing only removes contact eczema, it will not remove ingestion-related eczema. Bathing will not remove infected eczema, which usually needs treatment before it will go away.\n_top_\nStep 7: Remove or Reduce Detergents From Food Sources\nWashing dishes and kitchenware in soap removes the greatest source of detergents in most people\u2019s diets. Normal cooking and eating from detergent-washed dishes can introduce significant traces of detergents, from some foods more than others depending on the preparation or serving method. It may mistakenly seem as if those foods are causing the eczema.\nOnce the dishes and kitchenware have been washed in soaps, detergents in foods are a minor part of the problem but the toughest to ferret out. To get rid of the eczema completely, it is necessary to eliminate detergents in foods entirely. If you get a huge reduction in eczema from transitioning to soaps, but there remain hard-to-pinpoint breakouts that tend to be in the same areas, they are probably from detergents in foods.\nA woman in New Jersey, whose 3-year-old son had been the worst case of eczema in her pediatrician\u2019s practice, said she and the pediatrician used to cry together over it. Early in our conversation, she gave me a long list of foods she thought her son was allergic to. After she was able to clear up the majority of his eczema by switching to soaps, she said that he was only allergic to nuts and eggs after all.\nMany processed and prepared foods have detergents in them, as we have found. At least, when our son has gotten eczema from certain foods and we\u2019ve been able to get the same food completely unprocessed or with absolute certainty that no detergents were introduced, he didn\u2019t react to them. He got eczema, for example, from canned, jarred, pureed, and frozen peas, but he did not get eczema from fresh peas that we shelled and prepared in our own soap-washed kitchen.\nIt would have been easy for us to assume he was allergic to rice: he reacted to the processed baby rice cereals, so we gave him cooked rice porridge. He reacted to that. We of course observed these reactions before we figured out the detergent sensitivity, but we initially assumed he was allergic to rice. I wonder how many people do the same thing as we did, and assume their child is allergic to rice after they cook it themselves, not realizing the allergen could have come from whatever the pot was washed with.\nDetergents get into foods during processing. When I say \u201cprocessed,\u201d I\u2019m not just talking about foods people usually think of as processed, like Twinkies, but foods people think of as basic, like milk, oil, eggs, bananas, and poultry. If anybody did anything to the food except pick it and bring it to the market, consider it processed for the purposes of this discussion. The more that has to be done to the food to prepare it, especially in the presence of water, the more opportunities to introduce detergents.\nInfant formulas might have detergents in them, or at least that was our deduction from our experience. We tried virtually every major brand sold in this country, including hypoallergenic ones, and they all caused our son eczema. We could easily have assumed our son was allergic to milk, but that didn\u2019t make sense either, because he was more allergic to yogurt than plain milk \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if the problem had been the protein, it should have been the other way around. Yogurt is a more equipment-intensive product and probably has more detergents in it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the yogurt we make ourselves with whole milk from a large local organic dairy does not cause the eczema. We did find one infant formula from Europe that did not cause the eczema, but interestingly some of the other formulations from the same company \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with additional ingredients that require washing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 did cause it.\nMany food ingredients are washed, opening avenues for surfactants to end up in the final product. Detergents are used to wash equipment; small-batch, equipment-intensive-produced foods tend to cause breakouts. Plastic containers do not have to be washed, but at some point along the way, metals that become steel cans do. Canned and jarred foods tend to cause problems, though I am not sure whether it is because of how the cans and jars themselves are prepared, or because the contents tend to be wet-processed foods which are generally more of a problem than dry-processed foods. Detergents are among the substances approved for washing produce for canning or freezing, see: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=173.315 , 21CFR173.315 Chemicals used in washing or to assist in the peeling of fruits and vegetables. Remember, tiny traces of detergent can cause eczema in susceptible children \u00e2\u0080\u0094 traces that would easily remain on food-processing equipment that was regarded as clean. Quaternary ammonium compounds (detergents) are used in sterilizing some food processing equipment after it is cleaned.\nAlthough completely removing detergents from diet for any length of time is a tough step, it is worth doing all the way at least once, just to let your child experience completely healed, eczema-free skin. Even if you can\u2019t maintain a detergent-free diet \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is truly tough given our reliance on packaged and processed foods \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is worth doing at least once. When your child is completely clear, you can test foods for detergent reactions the same as you would different food groups on an elimination diet. It will allow you to see which foods are more of a problem than others, and allow you to make better judgment calls later, because it is truly difficult to maintain a completely detergent-free diet.\nGetting completely clear at least once is also worthwhile because it prepares you for when your child has a major ingestion exposure and needs to go detergent-free for awhile to eliminate a bad breakout.\nMost importantly, it is a huge psychological relief to be able to see exactly where all the eczema comes from, understand completely how it works, and to see how much control you have over eliminating it.\nThe breakouts from ingested detergents can happen immediately or up to a week after an ingestion. Our pediatric nutritionist told us that four days was usually as long as one needs to watch, and our experience bore that out.\nBreakouts from ingested detergents last longer than contact rashes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 contact rashes can be eliminated easily with a good washing procedure. A single ingestion-related breakout can last up to a week even if no other detergents are ingested.\nIn our experience, ingestion-related exposures can cause eczema anywhere, but there are common spots such as the upper arms, legs, back above the hips, and upper chest. Ingestion-related exposures tend to break out in the same spots, where the skin was last broken out. Thus, if the eczema becomes infected, it can be difficult to eliminate the open spots unless one has the ability to completely eliminate detergents in the diet for awhile.\nTo be honest, this is the one area where most people compromise and live with some eczema. But if all the other steps make a huge difference in the visible eczema, I would recommend trying to go detergent-free with foods for at least two or three weeks, taking care to maintain a balanced diet, of course.\nMost food manufacturers don\u2019t even think about detergent \u201ccontaminations\u201d beyond the rinsing measures they use \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I\u2019ve talked to many manufacturers who are so used to thinking of food purity in terms of preservatives, additives, and commonly allergenic food ingredients, that they automatically deny their products could have detergents introduced at any point. I have to usually press people to discuss the processing of each item in detail to get them to think about the issues relevant to this allergy.\nOften when I explain this allergy to people, they ask if using organic foods solves the problem. Like the manufacturers themselves, they confuse food purity vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis pesticides with absence of detergents. We do use organic foods for a few reasons. For one, pesticides may be sprayed using surfactants for even coverage. Non-organic foods may be subjected to other processing steps that introduce detergents, for example, one local grocery promises the food is guaranteed washed free of pesticides. Lastly, when one has to make so much food from basic ingredients, it\u2019s better to start with good quality ingredients, and at least where we live, the organic food is usually better.\nHowever, \u201corganic\u201d should not be confused with \u201cdetergent-free\u201d in regards to processing. Organic food processors have to comply with FDA food processing regulations, and that means washing equipment and raw produce. Do organic standards allow detergents? I can\u2019t say for sure, but based on the requirements and personal experience, I don\u2019t see how they could avoid it. This discussion is interesting to read, on whether potassium hydroxide (not a detergent) should be allowed under organic standards for peeling vegetables: http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:V4dyCnqT5B8J:www.ams.usda.gov/nop/NationalList/TAPReviews/pothydroxidel.pdf+21CFR173.315+organic&hl=en . Exceptions seem to be made for cleaning with synthesized products, since alternatives are not available. Organic makers are often smaller, and smaller batch processing has the potential for introducing greater amounts of detergents. We\u2019ve had the best luck getting detergent-free processed foods that are made in very large, high-tech facilities, but it is no guarantee.\nI am currently trying to find a contact in the FDA who can help me navigate the food processing industry to better identify processed foods my son can tolerate. As with so many aspects to this problem, I am still investigating.\nThe best advice I can give for now is to cook as many things from basic ingredients as possible, avoiding canned, jarred, and frozen foods. In our experience, baked goods with simple ingredients from large bakeries have been the most benign. We\u2019ve had good luck with organic maple syrup packed in plastic containers, mustard packed in plastic, spices, egg yolks, some pastas (we tend to buy brown rice pastas, though, I do not know whether wheat pastas would be processed differently), whole milk packed in cartons and plastic from a large, local organic dairy. (The dairy chemist told me that low-fat milk is a more processed product \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not only is the fat removed, but processed protein is added back to the final product. She said whole milk was probably a better bet for us.)\nFoods we\u2019ve had problems with: processed sugar (even brown sugar and ostensibly less-processed crystallized sugars), poultry, egg whites, bananas, ketchup, anything packed in recycled glass, have all been problematic. It\u2019s always possible our son is allergic to those things, but anytime we\u2019ve been able to test that by being absolutely certain no detergents are introduced, he has not had problems. When we\u2019ve made ketchup with homemade concentrated pear sweetener rather than processed sugar, and basic ingredients identical to our store-bought ketchup, our son had no eczema from it, but he\u2019s had a mild reaction to every brand of processed ketchup we\u2019ve tried. Acidic and fatty processed foods seem to be particularly susceptible to collecting detergent residues.\n_top_\nStep 8: Maintain a detergent-free home even when skin heals and seems stronger and less susceptible to breakouts\nAs children grow older, their skin becomes naturally less permeable and one would expect them to exhibit less eczema after infancy. The skin of children with detergent-reactive eczema will seem far stronger and healthier in a safe home environment where their skin is not subject to persistent breakouts. Even when children seem less susceptible to eczema breakouts, it is important to maintain these changes.\nMaintaining these changes will keep detergents out of dust in the home, and thus is an important step for mitigating the almost inevitable development of asthma in children with infantile eczema. (See the discussion on asthma on this web site.)\nIt is important for everyone in the home to make this switch in order to completely eliminate the eczema. To reduce asthma and seasonal allergies, everyone has to make the switch in order to keep detergents out of house dust. I cannot stress this enough. When people contact me after seeing that going detergent-free is making a huge difference but they still have breakout problems, the number one reason they fail to eliminate the eczema is that the whole household did not make the switch. Often, people think they can get away with switching just for the baby \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this is a huge amount of work, and makes too little of a difference. Other times, there is a holdout in the household, someone who is just so attached to their personal care products, they figure one little face wash or moisturizer isn't going to matter (it does). Often I find that the holdout is an adult with their own history of eczema or skin problems \u00e2\u0080\u0094 people with a history of sensitive skin are understandably reluctant to change. Many of the happiest success stories I hear from adults who resolve their skin problems by going detergent-free come about because they made the switch initially only for a child but didn't switch the whole household \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but when they finally did switch the whole household, found their own skin problems resolved, too.\n_top_\nWashing products that have worked for us:\nSince so many people ask me to make it easy to purchase products in one place, I have set up an Amazon.com astore where all of the products mentioned fit within the SolveEczema.org criteria. (A small portion of sales through that link will go to support this site.) Amazon.com is not necessarily the most optimal place to buy personal care products, but they had the tools to make more things available in one place. http://astore.amazon.com/solvsblogastore-20\nThere are a few companies that have a large selection of mostly just non-detergent products, I'm sure there are others not listed here (I have usde Cal Ben, Keys Soap and Dr. Bronners products, see below for more information):\nCal Ben\u00a0 www.calbenpuresoap.com\n"}, {"score": 1194.9095, "uuid": "b047acdd-4a94-545c-b425-b1f5ad7e158a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0402wb-69-26246", "target_hostname": "www.coradhealthcare.com", "target_uri": "http://www.coradhealthcare.com/Dandruff/dandruff_1.htm", "page_rank": 1.2022945e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Dandruff, scalp <em>psoriasis</em>, seborrheic dermatitis, ketoconazole, <em>psoriasis</em>", "snippet": "You should notice <em>the</em> scales begin to disappear and <em>the</em> scalp should become soft.

It is a very easily treatable condition. Seborrhea commonly manifests itself as a red, scaly, itchy rash most commonly seen on the scalp, sides of the nose, eyebrows, eyelids, skin behind the ears, and middle of the chest. Seborrheic dermatitis can also effect the navel (belly button), buttocks, skin folds under the arms, axillary regions, breasts, and groin, or other places where there are flaps of skin.\nCauses of seborrheic dermatitis: Seborrheic dermatitis can occur within patients that have neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Patients recovering from traumatic events such as heart attacks can develop seborrheic dermatitis. People in hospitals or nursing homes and people with immune system disorders can more prone to the disease. Most research will support the theory that a microorganism called \"pityrosporum ovale\", which is normally present in the skin, but can begin to feed on the dead skin cells and cause a rapid shedding of the skin, which appears as large, oily flakes and causes a red, itchy scalp. Normally, the skin will shed every 28 days, but this microorganism can cause the skin to shed every 7-21 days, like dandruff. Seborrheic dermatitis can also be called \"Cradle Crap\" and can occur in small infants.\nSeborrheic Dermatitis treatment: Seborrheic dermatitis can be easily treated with our DHS Tar shampoo, which contains a 2.9% solution of coal tar. Our coal tar formula is as effective as prescription brands, yet costs about 1/3rd as much. We recommend purchasing our DHS Tar formula in an 8 oz bottle, which should last about a month. We also offer our DHS Tar Gel formula, which contains a citrus fragrance (since tar can have an odor associated with it). You should start seeing results with our tar formula within a few days of treatment. You should notice the scales begin to disappear and the scalp should become soft. Unlike with psoriasis, you don't have to worry about building up a tolerance to shampoo treatments that include salicylic acid and ketoconazole.\nDandruff affects approximately 50% of the population in some mild to severe form. Dandruff Seborrheic dermatitis, a more severe form of dandruff is a chronic skin condition that affects the scalp. Dandruff manifests itself as dry skin, flakiness, itchiness and oily skin. Shedding of the skin is natural. Most people shed a layer of skin per month. People who suffer from dandruff shed their skin much faster and the result is a noticeable amount of flakiness.\nIn the normal healthy process of the scalp, new skin cells are continually being generated and are formed at the lowest level of the skin. These cells when formed, move to the outer surface about every 28 days, where they become flat and they shed unnoticed. With dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis, this process accelerates (most likely due to the fungus) and the skin rotates or sheds much faster and more like every 7-21 days. The result of the faster shedding is rather than flat, unseen cells, large clumps agglomerate from hundreds or thousands of microscopic cells and what you see are the flakes.\nDandruff Causes: Dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis are caused by a naturally occurring fungus that we all have called Malassezia that feeds on the skin's natural oils. Malassezie can cause irritation and speed up the shedding of skin. What determines the amount of dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis is a person's tolerance to the fungus.\nDandruff treatment: Dandruff can be easily treated with our DHS Tar shampoo, which contains a 2.9% solution of coal tar. Our coal tar formula is as effective as prescription brands, yet costs about 1/3rd as much. We recommend purchasing our DHS Tar formula in an 8 oz bottle, which should last about a month. We also offer our DHS Tar Gel formula, which contains a citrus fragrance (since tar can have an odor associated with it). You should start seeing results with our tar formula within a few days of treatment. You should notice the scales begin to disappear and the scalp should become soft. Unlike with psoriasis, you don't have to worry about building up a tolerance to shampoo treatments that include salicylic acid and ketoconazole.\nWhat is the difference between dandruff and just dry skin? The main difference iare flakes from dandruff are medium to large in size. The flakes are usually white and oily in appearance. The flakes are believed to be caused by Malassezia, a naturally occurring fungus found on the scalp. Dry scalp on the other hand is not quite as noticeable and is characterized by smaller flakes, excessive itching and occurs when your scalp lacks its natural oils.\nPsorias: Psoriasis is similar to seborrhea and eczema in its symptoms. According to the American Academy of Dermatologists , psoriasis is a \"persistent skin disease that got its name from the Greek word for \"itch.\" The skin becomes itchy, inflamed and produces silvery scales which are thickened and occur most often in the scalp, knees and lower back. The scales are also common in areas of the body where there are folds of skin. Psoriasis is not contagious. Approximately 2% of the population is affected with psoriasis. Approximately 150,000 new cases of psoriasis occur each year. Although the cause of psoriasis is unknown, the same result occurs as dandruff and seborrhea, which is the rapid shedding of skin. The skin becomes inflamed for some reason (perhaps due to a white blood cell abnormality), and the skin begins to become inflamed. Because of the inflammation, the shedding begins. In fact the shedding of skin is approximately every 3-4 days. Psoriasis can also be activated by cuts, abrasions, sun burn and scratches.\nPsoriasis flare-ups often occur in the winter when the skin is dry and flaky and as a result of the lack of UV sunlight. Each flare-up differs in severity, duration, location, and in the shape and pattern of the scales. The most common form begins with little red bumps. Gradually these grow larger and scales form. While the top scales flake off easily and often, scales below the surface stick together. When they are removed, the tender, exposed skin bleeds. These small red areas then grow, sometimes becoming quite large. Elbows, knees, groin and genitals, arms, legs, palms and soles, scalp and face, body folds and nails are the areas most commonly affected by psoriasis. It will often appear in the same place on both sides of the body. Nails with psoriasis have tiny pits on them. Nails may loosen, thicken or crumble and are difficult to treat.\nPsoriasis treatment: Psoriasis is treated effectively with several medications including our 2.9% coal tar shampoo, salicylic acid. We recommend starting with our tar shampoo. Most patients will see results within the first few days of shampooing. We also recommend that you shampoo every day until you see your flakes reduce in size and number. Your scalp should become softer as well. 80% of patients treated with our 2.9% tar shampoo will see excellent results. It is important to note that ALL SHAMPOO TREATMENTS (including prescription Nazoral) may become ineffective after a year or so of use. In this event, we recommend switching to our 3% salicylic acid formula (DHS Sal shampoo). Unlike other manufactures, we offer two very effective formulas for continuous, effective psoriasis therapy. If and when the DHS SAL becomes ineffective, switch back to the tar and you should see good results again. It is important to keep the bacteria in \"confusion\" and not let them get accustom to one treatment.\nin addition to medications such as a prescription of 2% ketoconazole, which can be found in shampoos such as Nazoral. J&J has recently introduced a 1% non-prescription formula of Nazoral as well. Our 2.9% tar formula and salicylic acid will work as well as the Nazoral. Nazoral costs about $30.00 per 8 oz bottle for the 2% solution and approximately $10.00 for the 1% solution. Our tar and salicylic acid formula's are as effective, yet 1/3rd - 1/2 the cost of competitive brands. Assume you use one bottle per month of ours or a competitor's brand. If you utilize our products, you will spend < $70.00 per year, vs. $120 - $300 per year.\n"}, {"score": 1069.3032, "uuid": "a0a1d8ca-09a1-5e69-bdd2-2fde1f810f5a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0208wb-58-14634", "target_hostname": "www.skintherapyletter.com", "target_uri": "http://www.skintherapyletter.com/2006/11.1/1.html", "page_rank": 1.1958421e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Etanercept for <em>the</em> Treatment of <em>Psoriasis</em>", "snippet": "<em>The</em> rate of serious infections did not increase over time, and there was no significant <em>difference</em> between <em>what</em> had been observed in <em>the</em> etanercept group <em>vs</em>. <em>the</em> placebo-treated patients, as well as cohorts of patients with RA.", "explanation": null, "document": "Etanercept for the Treatment of Psoriasis\nR. Bissonnette MD, FRCPC\nInnovaderm Research, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\nABSTRACT\nEtanercept has recently been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis at a dose of 50mg twice per week for 12 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 50mg once weekly thereafter. Clinical studies have shown excellent efficacy and a good safety profile in patients with psoriasis. Extensive information on etanercept safety is available as this biological agent has been used for many years for other indications such as rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis.\nKey Words: etanercept, plaque psoriasis, Enbrel\u00ae, psoriatic arthritis\nEtanercept (Enbrel\u00ae, Amgen/Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) is a fusion protein with affinity for soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and has been US FDA approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) since 1998. This biologic treatment is currently approved in several countries, including recent approval in Canada, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The approved dosage for treatment of psoriasis is 50mg subcutaneous (SC) twice per week for 3 months followed by 50mg once per week thereafter. This dosage regimen is different from the dose commonly used to treat RA, which is 25mg SC twice weekly.\nCurrent Therapies for Psoriasis\nCurrent treatment options for mild psoriasis include topical treatments such as calcipotriol, corticosteroids, and tar. For patients with more severe or extensive disease, phototherapy, including narrow band UVB and PUVA, has been shown to be very effective. Patients with severe and/or extensive disease, disease unresponsive to topical treatment and phototherapy, or disease that has a severe impact on quality of life, such as hand or foot involvement, are usually candidates for systemic therapy.\nThe three most frequently used oral medications for psoriasis in North America are methotrexate, acitretin, and cyclosporine. Biologics are a new therapeutics class for the treatment of psoriasis , and three agents are currently approved in the US and Canada for the treatment of psoriasis: alefacept (Amevive\u00ae, Biogen Idec), efalizumab (Raptiva\u00ae, Serono and Genentech/Xoma), and etanercept (Enbrel\u00ae, Amgen/Wyeth Pharaceuticals). This article will review safety and efficacy of etanercept in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.\nEfficacy of Etanercept in the Treatment of Psoriasis\nPASI (Psoriasis area severity index) is the primary endpoint used in studies assessing the efficacy of biologics for the treatment of psoriasis. PASI takes into account the extent of the disease, as well as the severity of erythema, scaling, and thickness in different body areas affected by psoriasis. Clinical improvement in biologics trials for psoriasis is usually reported as PASI-50 or PASI-75. A PASI-75 represents an improvement in the PASI score of at least 75% as compared with baseline (i.e., before the biologic was administered).\nEtanercept at a dose of 50mg SC twice per week has been shown to induce a PASI-75 response in 49% of patients after 12 weeks.1,2 Papp, et al. reduced the dose to 25mg twice per week for an additional 12 weeks and found that the percentage of patients exhibiting a PASI-75 response increased to 54%.2 In this study, 23% of patients lost their PASI-75 response when the etanercept dose was lowered to 25mg twice weekly; however, only 3% of these patients lost their PASI-50 response.2 Despite lowering the dose after 12 weeks, 32% of patients who did not reached PASI-75 at week 12 reached PASI-75 at week 24.2 Studies conducted with 25mg of etanercept twice weekly for 6 months (the last 3 months being open-label) demonstrated that 42%-44% of patients reached PASI-75 at week 24.1,2\nStudies were also conducted where etanercept was stopped after 3 months of continuous treatment to determine if this would lead to a rebound phenomenon, as this can be seen with other systemic agents used to treat psoriasis. Rebound was defined as an increase in PASI of at least 25% compared with baseline, or an erythrodermic, pustular, or severe inflammatory flare within 12 weeks of treatment cessation. Of the 409 patients studied, only one etanercept treated patient presented with an increase of PASI of more than 25% above baseline.3 This patient received a lower starting dose of etanercept (i.e., 25 mg weekly.) No cases or erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis were reported, suggesting that etanercept can be safely stopped.\nIn the same study etanercept was reintroduced when the disease relapsed, and the PASI-75 response was assessed following retreatment. The percentage of patients achieving a PASI-75 response was the same after retreatment as that seen in patients who received etanercept for the first time.3 These studies suggest that etanercept can be stopped and reinitiated without the induction of rebound or loss of clinical response.\nEtanercept has also been shown to reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis and has been approved in the US since June 2002 and in Canada since Jan 2004 for this indication.4 Etanercept should be considered as a treatment option in patients with both plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis.\nMechanism of Action\nEtanercept binds soluble TNF-a, thus preventing its interaction with TNF-a cell surface receptors. This inhibits the effects of TNF-a in the skin, such as the release of proinflammatory cytokines by keratinocytes and lymphocytes, as well as the increase in expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells. This mechanism seems to differ from some of the other TNF-a antagonists that have an affinity for soluble as well as membrane bound TNF therefore enabling cell lysis following interaction with TNF-a.5,6\nAdverse Events\nThe current information on etanercept safety comes from clinical studies conducted in patients with various diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, RA, ankylosing spondylitis, and juvenile arthritis as well as from post-marketing experience. To date it is estimated that more than 337,000 patients worldwide, including over 74,000 patients with psoriasis, have received etanercept. Clinical studies are ideal to study the incidence and severity of frequent side-effects but are usually not powerful enough to assess less frequent adverse events. For example, clinical studies conducted with etanercept have given precise information on injection site reactions but cannot adequately assess the incidence of less frequent events such as serious infections.\nThe most commonly reported adverse event is injection site reactions, which occurred in 14%-20% of patients in psoriasis studies.1 These are characterized by erythema and edema at injection sites and are usually mild.\nSerious infections, sometimes resulting in death, have been reported in patients treated with all anti-TNFa agents including etanercept. In patients with psoriasis who participated in placebo-controlled studies, the number of serious infections per patient per year was similar in patients treated with placebo and patients treated with etanercept.1,2 In an ongoing long-term, open-label study of patients treated with etanercept for RA, there was no increase in serious infections.7 There were 1272 patients with either early RA or long-standing RA enrolled in this trial, with some having received continuous etanercept for more than 8 years. The rate of serious infections did not increase over time, and there was no significant difference between what had been observed in the etanercept group vs. the placebo-treated patients, as well as cohorts of patients with RA. The exact role of etanercept in these serious infections is currently unknown.\nCases of demyelinating disorders have been reported in patients treated with anti-TNFa, including etanercept. A study conducted in the past with another anti-TNFa agent (lenercept), used to treat patients with multiple sclerosis, was stopped because of worsening of the disease under study.8 Cases of new onset multiple sclerosis, exacerbation of established multiple sclerosis, as well as optic neuritis and myelitis have been reported in patients treated with anti-TNFa agents, including etanercept.9 Some of these cases were reversible upon cessation of etanercept whereas others were not. In an ongoing long-term, open-label study in patients with RA, two cases of MS were reported.7 The causality of etanercept in these events as well as the exact risk of demyelinating disease with etanercept is unknown.\nPatients with active tuberculosis should not be initiated on anti-TNFa agents. Cases of reactivation of latent TB have been reported with anti-TNFa agents, including etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab.10 Most cases were reported from patients treated with anti-TNFa antibodies as opposed to the etanercept fusion protein. The current US and Canadian monographs do not require TB screening before initiating etanercept,9,11 but many physicians currently prefer to perform a purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD) skin test and/or a chest X-ray. This should at least be considered for patients at higher risk of TB including patients coming from countries where TB is more frequent.\nClinical trials with etanercept, including a long-term, open-label RA trial, have not shown that patients are at higher risk of solid tumors.7 Cases of lymphoma were reported in patients treated with etanercept.7 In a long-term, open-label RA study, four cases of lymphoma were reported in patients with early RA and 7 cases in patients with long-standing RA when the expected number, based on the SEER database, were 0.8 and 1.1, respectively.7 These data should be interpreted with caution as patients with RA are at higher risk of developing lymphoma, and the risk increases with severity of the disease.12,13 It is currently unknown if the lymphoma cases seen in etanercept treated patients represent the fact that severe patients with RA are more at risk of lymphoma than the general population, or if etanercept has a role in the genesis of lymphomas. Interestingly patients with psoriasis (not treated with biologics) have also been reported to have an increased risk of lymphoma.14\nCases of an increase in pre-existing as well as new onset congestive heart failure (CHF) have been reported.9 The role of etanercept in these cases is unknown. Two clinical trials that were designed to assess the safety and efficacy of etanercept in the treatment of CHF were stopped because of lack of efficacy.9\nAdverse Events\n"}], [{"score": 991.4217, "uuid": "4e640de9-e0c4-56ed-a8b7-797450a86b2b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1509wb-24-28290", "target_hostname": "www.eczema.ndo.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.eczema.ndo.co.uk/log9707.htm", "page_rank": 1.2105145e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Eczema</em> Mailing List - July 1997 Archive", "snippet": "Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to tell <em>what</em> <em>is</em> herpes <em>vs</em> regular <em>eczema</em> but <em>the</em> herpes always starts on my eyelids .

A food SENSITIVITY, however, may take as long as a day (or more) to show up.\nIf what you're sensitive to is a byproduct of the digestion of a given food, or is related to things like Leaky Gut syndrome, you're not going to see an immediate reaction. The food has to reach a certain point in the digestive process before it causes trouble.\nI'm told by both an allergist and a dermatologist that tests for food allergy or sensitivity are not accurate for anyone, with or without eczema. Having never had any food allergy tests, I can't judge...\nOn a more personal note... My eczema seems to be calming down lately. Dunno if it's significant, but right about the time it seemed to start easing off is when our water softener clogged up, and we disconnected it. I've been showering in hard water for the last few weeks. This is especially interesting, given that I never in my life had eczema until we moved into this house with the softener. Probably not related, but it's certainly one of those \"things that make you go 'hmmm'... \"\nDate: 1 Jul 1997 From: John Subject: interferon\nInterferon is a shot that I take intravenously. The way I understand it works is that it suppressed the T cells. My body produces too many T cells so this medication controls the production. Im sure there are more knowledgeable people out there who can explain more about it.\nThere are 3 different kinds of interferon; alpha, beta and gamma. The beta is not used for eczema but the other two are used. I tried the alpha (cheaper cost) initially but this did not work. My dr got me on the gamma (more expensive) and I have been doing much better.\nDate: 1 Jul 1997 From: Susanne Subject: Balnetar Bath Oil and Boric Acid Ointment\nWhen I was a baby, my mother swore she would stay away from using steriod treatments due to a fear that it would someday cause more harm than good. She resorted to soaking me in Balnetar Bath oil and using 10% Boric Acid Ointment after these baths. By the time I was three the eczema had disappeared for years to come.\nDate: 1 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: interferon\nAnyone with eczema has a problem with their T cells. Someone mentioned that interferon's another immunosuppressant like steroids are, so they weren't interested, just remember the interferon is working on the cause and the steroid is just treating a symptom.\nDate: 1 Jul 1997 From: Robert Subject: Balnetar Bath Oil and Boric Acid Ointment\nDid your eczema come back?... mine also went away after the first few years and then came back with a vengeance later on. I would doubt that the bath oil and ointment were the cures, but rather relief during the time it was active.\nDate: 1 Jul 1997 From: Sue Subject: birth order, stopping emolients\nJust wanted to update people on our experiment with stopping all emolients on Isaac's skin (he's 2, had eczema since 5 mos.). One month ago we stopped putting Aquafor on him; we'd been slathering him with it a few times a day. The first few days after we stopped he looked pretty bad--very dry, cracky skin--and he scratched maybe a little bit more than normal. Then he started to get better, and now his skin actually looks pretty good. He has no scabs anywhere on his body (except for some skinned knees), and although his legs and elbows are very dry looking, they don't seem to itch him very much.\nDuring this month, we have put a light layer of almond oil on his skin about 8 times--when he asked for it. We probably could have gone completely cold turkey, but we decided to let him decide on this.\nIn the last couple of days, we have been forced to use some sunscreen on him, and that definitely is NOT helping the situation; he gets little acne-like bumps a few days later. We are still experimenting to find one that doesn't mess him up.\nAbout the birth order question: Isaac is our first and only kid, and he has eczema. I was allergic to dairy as an infant (and grew out of it), and my husband was allergic to wheat as an infant (and grew out of it). My husband is now allergic to pollen and cats. Because both of us have a tendency to \"atopia,\" which can be manifested as eczema, allergies, or athsma, it was pretty likely that Isaac was going to have one of those things. However, I don't really buy the genetic argument about not having kids for fear of passing on the errant gene. First, the passing is not that clear-cut. Second, the environmental factors contribute to whether the kid gets it or not. Third, even if a kid DOES get it, who's in a better position to parent that child than someone who knows a lot about it and knows what it's like? If we assume that ALL children are going to inherit genes for some problem or other, this seems more like a \"so how can we give our kid the best chance possible?\" question, not a question of deciding (for that reason) to not have kids at all. Of course, there are good reasons for not having kids, so maybe this just fits in a larger decision not to have them. And adoption is a great alternative, but still, you're going to get a kid who's genetically predisposed to SOMETHING...\nDate: 1 Jul 1997 From: Karen Subject: EJ Update\nKay, According to what I've been reading lately, if dust or something lingering in the AC ductwork is an allergen for EJ, that very well could account for the eczema getting worse after turning on the AC. Have you had EJ tested for allergies? My 3-y-o's eczema didn't start improving until after she had allergy testing and we knew the specific culprits to watch out for.\nDate: 1 Jul 1997 From: Suzannah Subject: food allergies - birth order\nYour allergist said what all doctors say. Food allergies are immediate - this is in many ways true, if I eat crab I come up in very itchy red welts therefore this is a true allergy.\nBut food intolerances can indeed show up much later. This is something most of us have realised. You do have to be on an elimination diet, introducing 1 new food a week - the results are pretty clear if you try this. It took 4 days back on yeast for a fairly severe eczema reaction in my case, but only 12 hours for a reaction to champagne (not a hangover!!).\nIt is the standard medical response to say 'you would know what you were allergic to' - but why should we if it is a minor allergy, only getting cumulatively worse. Why are the medical profession so resistant to the idea of food intolerances? They give us muscle relaxants to treat 'irritable bowel', steroid creams to treat eczema, pain killers for headaches, then say 'you've just got to learn to live with it' - but they refuse to consider we may need a more holistic approach and may be affected by food.\nIts incredibly hard work to work out your own allergies and its easy to give up. I am sure that not everyone with eczema has food allergies, but I think quite a lot actually do.\nBTW, I have come across something in a book today saying that it is usually the oldest child who has the worst allergies. In latter days the eldest had the strongest immune system and most immunity to parasites and nasty diseases and was most likely to survive childhood, now that these are not such a problem and these firstborns with these strong immune systems fight off substances that are no threat with eczema, hayfever etc - totally overreacting to a harmless substance.\nMakes sense to me as the eldest and most allergy prone.\nDate: 1 Jul 1997 From: Richard Subject: Supplements\nGood Stuff: vit C minimum 2000 mg/day vit E 2000 units/day Calcium 3 tabs twice per day 100% daily requirement Flax seed oil caps 7 @ 500 units per day Grape seed extract 4 caps twice per day 1 cap vit B complex 2 caps of Chinese herbs twice per day\nNot so good Stuff: Pyruvate Caffeine Slim caps (guarana) Calms Forte (for sleep) Ambien (sleeping pill when needed)\nDate: 1 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: Doctors disagree.\nMy allergist and dermatologist are both recent grads of med school and both are telling me to get retested with skintests for food allergy . I have been reluctant but am going to do it again, for the third time. Once as a kid. Once at age 29 and about 30 years ago. Both tests gave results that seem accurate for me. But my dermatolgist feels my allergies may have changed. I am not sure why. I gotta ask why next time I see him. The allergist agrees. I have had eczema since six months age.\nDate: 2 Jul 1997 From: Judith Subject: Prevention Mag's vitamins\nI have been following the Prevention Magazine (and a large assortment of their home remedy books) for many years now. I got myself to the local GNC and stocked up on all their recommended supplements including the ones you mentioned above PLUS Evening primrose oil, max EPA (fish oils) zinc, Vit. E, and massive doses of C. The evening primrose oil (both taken internally and applied to the skin) helps keep the skin from getting really dry and the maxEPA works the same way - don't use the maxEPA topically. since I have been taking them, I have not had a really bad flare - but who knows - maybe it is just in remission now. I just keep on taking the supplements because I am afraid not to and they seem to be helping the rest of my body, so it's not a complete loss. It can't hurt - except if you take overdoses of the ones that accumulate. Check an RDA guide for maximum dosages.\nDate: 2 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: Prevention Mag's vitamins\n>> Check an RDA guide for maximum dosages. <<\nThe RDA is for the healthy and non-stressed with no history of disease, does anyone know anyone like this? An old trick for taking high dosages of supplements (especially oil-based), choose one day a week that you don't take any supplements.\nDate: 2 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: food allergy/sensitivity\nThanks for your info about food allergy/sensitivity. What you write makes a lot of sense. Yet, I must say that like Anjum, I went on a very strict diet for 4-5 years eating only rice, lentils, bananas, pears, turkey, beans, water, and spelt products, and vitamin supplements. It was such a drag. I did keep records of what I ate and even included a rating of how itchy I was each day. Honestly, it didn't seem to help. Like I said earlier, I'm not on a diet anymore (well, I avoid dairy products because of the immediate reaction), and I seem to be doing better than when I was on the diet.\nI really think that my eczema much more has to do with the environment in which I live. One year after my family moved into our present house, both my sister and I started getting bad e. But I don't know... even went I went away to university, I didn't seem to get better. Anyways, I hear that the area in which I live is supposed to be one of the worst areas for allergies in Ontario. So, yes, I'm moving out.\nBut you have got me thinking, and I will try to cut down on the junk food and to vary my foods more, so I don't accumulate mild reactions. and I'll let you know if I get any better.\nDate: 2 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: interferon\nI'm going to ask my derm about interferon. Just a few more questions: How long does the shot last for, and what are the side effects? Do you know if it can cause any possible long-term damage?\nAlso, Kelly, you wrote that interferon works on the cause whereas steroids only deal with the symptoms. What do you mean by that? Do you recommend interferon? and has it really cleared you up as well as steroid injections have?\nDate: 2 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: Grape Seed Extract\nI was having a wonderful several-month-long remission of eczema, then recently started taking grape seed (for reasons other than skin), and about a week later, my eczema has begun to flare up worse than it's been in months. I really don't believe this is an adverse reaction to grape seed at all, but I was wondering if maybe you have to take it for 8 weeks to see a positive effect, like with EFAs?\nAlso, how much is 8 capsules in milligrams?\nDate: 2 Jul 1997 From: Faith Subject: Doctors disagree.\nBoth the dermatologist and the allergest I spoke to were fairly young (at least to my eyes), but I don't know how long it's been since they graduated medical school, or where they did their training. I do know I had to push the dermatologist before he would do basic patch testing, so you may want to take what he says with the same grain of salt I use...\nI should get a better idea on the water softener sometime next week -- the plumber's coming in to put a particulates filter ahead of the softener. Once that's in place, we shouldn't need to worry about having the softener plug up again, and can get it back to doing its job. Then we'll see what happens to my skin...\nDate: 2 Jul 1997 From: Tina Subject: weighty question\nI am just curious... most eczema parents say that their children are growing slowly, most likely due to diet (I believe that with my son) and that they are at the low end of the growth scales. With all the diets that adult eczema sufferers put themselves through, are most of you light on the scales? Are most of you adults smaller than your siblings?\nDate: 2 Jul 1997 From: Kim Subject: To: Kim & el\nEl is almost three and has been eating beans for a long time. I read that Kidney beans had a lot of EFA's so he eats them plain about twice a week. But the baked beans at the picnic were the sweetened up with who knows what ( I am alway suspect when somebody else is cooking) Anyway he did not sleep very well but he had eaten a lot of beans. No itching, his skin looked great but I think with was the digestion thing. Anyway, I noticed that he was kind of clamy feeling and I remember that from last summer nights. He was just in his undies, (we don't have AC) but he seemed warmer that typical. So I don't know if he was having a reaction or he was warm for being restless. The next day skin still good, but he and I were grumpy do to lack of sleep. Last night he sleep good, but I could not go to sleep.\nWe will try another new food in the next couple of days. If we did not have to avoid corn, life would be a lot easier. But I know he eat a better diet than typical for his age, he gets very few sweets (most have corn syrup) So I try to tell my self he won't ever have a weight problem. El has never been skinny. At his 2 year check he was at like 5% height (we are short) and about 40% weight. Is you son thin and has he had trouble gaining weight. Also, you guys don't do wheat and my El is a bread lover so I can see some difference there.\nDate: 2 Jul 1997 From: Kim Subject: Mile Stone for E baby\nJust wanted to share this with people who would understand. I remember last July 4th holding my son so he would sleep. It was really hot 100+ and the only cool place we could find was my folks basement family room. El was covered with E and if I laid him down to sleep he would wiggle to scratch him self from one end of the bed to the other. We had just been to the Dr. for the 16th time since he was born (1 year and 8 months) with anitiboitic for yet another ear infection. All I could do was sit there and cry and wonder what I was ever going to do to make him comfortable. Well, in the last year we have been to the Dr. 4 times. After taking some foods out of his diet, joining this list, and deciding that the dr. was not as close to a god as he thinks we are 200% happier. Skin is even what I would call good and we are going to the lake over the weekend, it seems we have come along way in the last year and I want to thank everybody on this list for being there for us.\nDate: 2 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: interferon\nEczema is part of a bigger disorder, by applying topicals we won't cure anything, in fact steroids worsen the condition, we need to work on what is going on inside our bodies, not the final result.\nI have not tried interferon but it still in consideration, I haven't found anything that would make me eliminate is as a treatment option and no, I will never do steroid injection EVER again, you'll kill your adrenals doing that and when your adrenals function less or die your eczema will become severely worse. You guys should really quit playing with this before you become steroid dependent.\nDate: 2 Jul 1997 From: Susanne Subject: About Balnetar and Boric Acid Ointment\nI agree that Balnetar Bath Oil and Boric Acid Ointment is no cure for eczema. In fact, I believe there is no cure available for eczema, but I do see it, in my case, as an alternative to steroid treatments.\nAt age 3 my eczema did go away, but it did reoccur at the age of 14. Since then it is an occational thing, coming and going with activities such as stress and changes in the season. I still continue to treat it with Boric Acid Ointment and direct applications of Balentar Bath Oil. This seems to work pretty well, clearing it up for a while.\nDate: 2 Jul 1997 UT From: David Subject: weighty question\nI am the tallest in my family (although only slightly) at 6'5''. I'm skinny, but so are half of my siblings, none of whom have eczema.\nDate: 2 Jul 1997 From: Cindy Subject: update on Nathan\nWe took Nathan to the pedi yesterday. Turns out he'd spent the weekend at a conference and heard a pediatric dermatologist speak and he thought about Nathan. She suggested using Triamcinolon ointment rather than the cream (we were using the cream) because it will absorb better and therefore be more effective.\nShe also said that bathing is fine just as long as you remember to grease up (hydrate) immediately afterwards.\nWe started round two with the Triam. yesterday and already are seeing a big improvement on N's feet (it was really thick there). Hopefully we can get it to clear up and then can see if we can determine triggering factors.\nAnyone know if grass allergies can trigger eczema? He's just started playing outside in the yard in the last couple of weeks (he's been walking for about a month now).\nDate: 5 Jun 1997 From: Robin Subject: asian kids/eczema\nOur dermo also says that much of the worst eczema he sees is in Asian people. I have no idea why this would be so. The dermo has a theory about the immune system and the intestines and eczema in Asian people and he explained it to me but I couldn't follow it well enough to repeat it. I am on an email list for adoptive parents of chinese children and eczema is a regular topic there.\nDate: 5 Jun 1997 From: Robin Subject: interferon\nI mentioned recently that my dad died a few months ago and that we were told it was likely connected to long-term interferon use. Last week we got the autopsy report and are advised that the cause of death was primarily leukemia, combined with a number of systemic infections, all as a result of a severely weakened immune system - this weakening having been caused by long-term interferon use. He took interferon shots for five years, from 1986-1990. We were told that the form of leukemia he had can be tolerated and held in remission for years and years, often with the person dying of something unrelated. With the immune system problem, however, dad was not able to handle it. So, please be informed when using interferon.\nDate: 3 Jul 1997 From: Jolie Subject: weighty question\nMy son's pediatric gastroenterologist who knows a lot about infant eczema stated that in some cases the children with bad conditions of eczema do not grow at the proper rate. Since my son is not one of those, I did not probe any further. I know that a few subscribers here describe their children on the light side.\nDate: 3 Jul 1997 From: Jolie Subject: To: Kim & el\nThanks for the information, I will try kidney beans next. Aren't baked beans made with tomato sause? Citris (ie. tomatoes) is definately out for my son at this point. I forgot to mention three additional items he is eating, celery, barley and watermelon. As far as weight, he was born at 10'9 a pretty hefty weight since I am 115 lb and 5'6\". His weight and height are still above average, thank god. My doctor said it is not unusual for children with this condition to have problems growing, I did not probe any further since my son was not one of those. You asked me about, corn, he was prick tested and corn was a low allergen. However, he can only eat white corn. You are right about eating pretty well, a friend's 5 year old survives on hot dogs, pizza and junk cereal. My son eats more than this kid so I've stopped worrying!\nDate: 3 Jul 1997 From: Jeremy Subject: E & Air Conditioning\nMy skin has been pretty good the past month or two... And all of a sudden it has started to get worse again. I really haven't changed my diet that I am aware of. The only thing I can think of is the use of air conditioning.\nNow, I know that air conditioning is better for allergies and such... However, I am wondering if the fact air conditioners remove humidity from the air could be making my skin conditions worse?\nWhen I sat down and thought about it... My skin cleared up really well after the winter cold had left and I wasn't really using heating anymore. Perhaps that heating and cooling my apartment are removing too much moisture from the air?\nI'm wondering if I should get a vaporizer to give this a shot. However, it seems to me that either 1) The air conditioing would remove the moisture pretty quick or 2) I might cause mold growth if I'm not careful, and I know I can be lazy (ie not cleaning the moisturizer properly).\nNOTE: I live in an apartment... Electric heat, and room air conditioners. I know the baddies of forced air heating and cooling hehe.\nAny input on this would be appreciated. I'm been turning off the A/C at night and opening the windows in an attempt to balance the amount of time I'm spending in the air conditioning.\nDate: 3 Jul 1997 From: Richard Subject: LYNN - GRAPE SEED EXTRACT\nLynn - It took months to see any effect and I cannot be sure its the GSE. However, when I upped my dose from 4 caps in the AM to 4/AM, 4/PM, my skin got even better. Coincidence? Ingredients: 40 mg GSE/cap and 830 mg of yucca, hawthorne berry, bilberry, gingkobiloba and milk thistle/cap. It is a product put out by New Visions International.\nDate: 3 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: fixing up your insides\nI went to a new derm today and she said I shouldn't try any new-fangled treatments like interferon until they were thoroughly researched 4 or 5 times.\nI told her I wasn't keen on using topical steroids, but she said that was the best way of treating eczema and that mild dosages wouldn't thin out my skin. I also told her that while they cleared up my skin for two days, the eczema would come back where ever I used the ointment, and even worse. She told me to taper the treatment.\nNow, what do you think about that? should I or shouldn't I try steroids again? I've been going cold turkey these past three weeks, and I sometimes I think that little by little my skin is clearing up, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's just my imagination.\nHow do we go about curing the insides of our bodies? I spent 3 years with a naturopath who said the same thing. She treated me with hydrotherapy, acupuncture, homeopathy, diets, and all sorts of vitamins and chinese herbs, all no no avail. I gave up on her when I began to suspect her of tomfoolery; when I ran out of a certain herb, I would ask for a re-fill, and she would give me a different bottle with a different herb. Everything was in Chinese so I never knew what I was taking. I also realized that she eventually stopped taking records of what she prescribed.\nI'm sorry to bother you again, but I'm very interested to hear what you mean by fixing up our insides... detoxification? Kelly, what are you doing, presently, to treat your eczema?\nDate: 3 Jul 1997 From: Heather Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nI have had eczema as long as I can remember. When I was younger I mainly had it around the folds of my skin. I am sure it is inherited my father has eczema still to this day and he is 55. Doesn't give me much hope that it will ever get better!\nThe eczema never was much of a problem until recently. I can remember some times when I was younger that it would get worse, usually over the summer because I like the outdoors and to swim. I realized that sitting in a wet bathing suit really aggravates the eczema.\nAt the beginning of this year I developed eczema much worse. It is still a mystery as to why. It was all over and I was constantly scratching. I changed allergists. I thought that if I took predisone for a few days it would clear up and go away. I was really only concerned with my face. I never had eczema on my hands. When one area cleared up another would get worse.\nAt the beginning of the summer it was all over my legs. It is still an enigma to me. I don't know what I do to make it worse or better. All of my past doctors have told me to stay out of the shower. I am young, and active and care about my appearance and therefore sporadic bathing was out of the question especially when showers are what made me feel better.\nThis allergist says that showers are okay if the temperature is cool. The eczema and the scratching gets much worse after dinner. At first I thought I was allergic to the foods that I was eating at dinner and that was why the eczema flared up at this time. My allergist told me that cortisone levels decrease in the evening. So who knows ???? but I do think that especially spicy foods and acidic foods like tomato sauce cause the eczema to be worse. Does anyone else notice this??\nPresently the eczema is as good as it will ever be --some days better than others. I drown myself in cetaphil lotion on my legs and cetaphil mosturizing cream [it is in a tub like eucerin] on my upper body. The cream is the best one I have ever tried and feels amazing on the skin -- it is not as thick as eucerin and cold on the skin when you apply it. It is also very good for sunburn I have found. I use westcort on the very bad areas which seems to work the best for me of the cortisone creams. My doctor actually said it is the least concentrated. I asked my eyed doctor about using it on my eyes and he said he never heard about a connection with cataracts. I also use zonalon cream which is an anti-itch cream which burns a little but actually takes the itch away.\nIt is hard I like to exercise and run around especially sweating but I am afraid of any flareups. For now I have been walking in the evenings when it is cooler and also air conditining on as much as possible. I strongly believe that keeping cool is the best remedy. I take Zyrtec at nights which keeps me from itching and keeps me sleeping.\nMy daily routine with all the creams takes a long time and is annoying but it seems to work for now!\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Yolande Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nI'm wondering about the effect of steroids on the eyes, as sometimes I am tempted to use a little near my eyelids when they start to get red and irritated. I heard that steroids getting into eyes could cause glaucoma. Have not heard about the cataracts bit. Has anyone heard about this from their doctor?\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Sue Subject: Birth Order\nBoth my father and me are firstborn children with eczema. All four of my siblings are allergic to varying degrees, but I'm by far the worst. Lucky me.\nI'm second from the tallest and the heaviest of the bunch and have the worst allergies/eczema of the family. One of my brothers (the tallest) is also the thinnest of the family, and he's got very slight allergy problems and no skin problems whatsoever.\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Rebecca Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nWhen I sat down and really thought about it, I asked my self whose needs were more important, mine or my son's. Putting wet pajamas on my child before he goes to bed makes me feel uncomfortable too. I *need* to feel like a good mother. But, I decided I needed to put *my* discomfort aside in order to make my son more comfortable. My son still hasn't expressed an interest in doing the \"wet jammie treatment\", but if he does, I will try it.\nI think my son doesn't want to do it because he is tactically defensive and can only tolerate the feel of certain clothing styles and materials against his skin. He didn't start with eczema until about four months ago, however, he has been tactically defensive since birth. My son's dermo swears by the treatment because his two daughters suffer terribly with eczema. He said they are to the point now where they will ask him to do the \"wet jammie treatment.\"\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Karen Subject: asian kids and eczema\nSince I have eliminated milk from my diet, I feel much better and my skin is better too. Milk is not a component in Asian diet, so this does not surprise me. It was virtually impossible for me to eat out with friends unless we went to an Asian restaurant. I think the diet has a huge role to play. Chinese people eat a lot of rice, tofu, fish and vegetables. There is almost always a clear soup at every meal, providing lots of water. In Hong Kong, the many times I have been back, the food was bought fresh every day. It was cool and humid in the winter, and my skin felt better. Many North Americans eat a lot of junk. Going to the grocery store cracks me up but also depresses me when I see what others buy. Why would you give your kid a fruit roll-up when you could give him a piece of fruit for so much cheaper? And whole milk! Just because they're kids doesn't mean they need all that fat. Don't even get me started on what's in cereal, or the myriad of processed snack foods aimed at children.\nFor those of you with Asian kids, maybe try feeding them on a diet that more closely resembles what there bodies were built to handle. It certainly can't hurt them, and it is much healthier than what they'd be eating otherwise.\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: asian kids and eczema\nIt's interesting that you should note that Asian kids seem to have eczema the worst. I wonder if it could be one or both of these factors:\nPerhaps the North American climate is not suitable for Asian kids prone to eczema. After all their ancestors spent years and years in hot climates, perhaps asian kids are genetically not \"prepared\" for cold, dry weather and drastic weather changes. I find that the parts of my body where skin has no eczema is even even less dry during summer when I'm not wearing piles of clothes.\nPerhaps our North American diet is not ideal for eczema-prone children. Asians have a very different diet and even Chinese food here is not authentic Chinese food. The fruits, vegetables and basic meals are very very different.\nWhen my sister went to Korea, I wonder if it was the change in climate or the drastically different diet that helped her out so much. I wonder if kids living in Asia who are prone to eczema have it as bad as Asian kids living in North America.\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: cetaphil creme\nI agree that having eczema on your face is extremely bothersome. I'm glad to hear that you have found a way to control it. After 9 years, I'm still groping in the dark for a way to keep it under control without too much topical steroids.\nI've been using Eucerin creme a lot, but I really don't like the heaviness of it. This Cetaphil mosturizing creme that you're using, did your derm recommend it, and does it have lanolin in it? Also, what are the active ingredients?\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Patsy Subject: cetaphil creme\nIf you don't like heavy moisturizers, let me recommend several things I've found that work beautifully. Both creamy petroleum jelly and creamy baby oil are great. The pj is heavier and stays greasier longer, but I'm able to use the baby oil and get dressed within a few minutes w/o worrying about stained clothing. Check ingredient lists to make certain neither contain anything that further exacerbates your problems.\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Shelley Subject: Genetics\nYes, there IS research showing linkage to at least two genes. But as I have said many times before, this condition is multifactorial, it involves other factors including environmental, etc. in addition to the genes. This makes research difficult, so there is much more research done on diseases that only involve the genes, like cystic fibrosis (CF). They can now do gene therapy for CF, which means they insert a normal gene and that gene takes over for the mutated gene and makes the disease go away. If only eczemawas that simple...\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Shelley Subject: The problem with interferon\nYes, interferon can lead to fatality. I posted a message awhile ago mentioning that many transplant patients who take it get cancer as a result and die from that.\nMy mother died last year. She had chronic leukemia for a long time and finally died of congestive heart failure. She didn't take interferon because of the known problems with it.\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Shelley Subject: Despair & Acceptance\nI spent my entire childhood on various diets and it did nothing to help my skin. I couldn't go anywhere without this 10 page list of things to avoid. At one point I was only allowed to eat apples, meat, and vitamin supplements. The whole experience was awful, and all to no avail. Food allergies seem to cause SOME people's eczema, but not all.\nSalty foods, spicy foods, and other specific foods make a problem I already have worse, but they do not cause my problem in the first place. If I put all my focus on food, or looking for other specific causes, I would feel despair the way I did as a child. What helps keep me sane is simply accepting my condition, and focusing on what I can do to feel better when I feel bad. I put absolutely no energy into wondering why? For me, that leads to despair because there is no answer to that question. My condition just is the way it is. I have no control over it. It comes and goes in various forms without any pattern at all. It's like an ongoing art piece that is created involuntarily. Every day I wake up and see what my body looks like today. I'm a walking art gallery.\nNow remember, I am 40 years old and have had severe problems since birth, so my philosophy must be put into that context. If you have not yet explored the possibilities of \"causes\" then go for it. I'm just trying to say that after you search for years without success, it becomes necessary to let go and accept the basic condition. I focus on trying to alleviate the day to day suffering. I need ALL my energy for that.\nWhen I was a child, my mother was so focused on the causes and the why? that she had no energy left to focus on ME and alleviate my actual suffering. I guess that's partly my reason for mentioning all this.\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Steve Subject: Cataracts and E.\nUnfortunately I have had cataracts in both eyes. The lens in my right eye was taken out ten years ago after an accident. Now I have to have the same done to my left eye. But my surgeon has told me that the cataracts is caused not by the accident I had BUT probably by my eczema. I mentioned that I was always wary of using steroids on my face but he said it was more likely to be the eczema rather than the steroids. This reqally gave me a jolt.\nPersonally I beleive my cataracts did start with the accident I had in 87. The combination of my eczema and steroids has just accelerated the problem.\nMy surgeon is one of the top in his field so I do take his word, but if I heard it from anyone else I would have to take it with a large pinch of salt.\nCan anyone else verify that it is eczema and not the steroids that may cause or worsen the effects of cataracts or is it a fallacy?\nIf I had a choice I would swap eczema for cataracts anytime. Cataracts is easily treatable after some minor surgery and I have been told I will not have to worry about getting cataracts in my later years after my op.\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Rebecca Subject: heavy moisturizers\nYou might also try using pure jojoba oil or almond oil. They are both powerful moisturizers and feel very light. I don't have eczema, but I have suffered from acne all my life. There are very few moisturizers I can use, but these two oils are light and powerful!\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Diane Subject: cetaphil creme\nI believe Cetaphil cleanser (is that different from the cream you are talking about?) does contain lanolin.\nDate: 4 Jul 1997 From: Karen Subject: Heather-eczema on legs\nHeather, You mentioned bad eczema on your legs. I used to have awful splotches of it all over my legs too, but I've cleared it up, and without steroids too, so maybe this will help you. I'm even wearing shorts these days, for thie first time in about 4 years!\nMy mom took me to see an acupuncturist for two weeks over holidays in december. She did some needlework, and recommended I take the following vitamin supplements: B, C, E, calcium and magnesium, and a multivitamin. Also, every night, to take one tablespoon of psyllium seed, mix it into a glass of water and drink it. Psyllium is supposed to detoxify the blood. She also gave me needles to apply to myself and taught me some foot massages to do everynight. I have been following her routine since then. I should also mention I haven't seen her since January. Anyway, in April my boyfriend said my legs looked way better and all the splotches were gone. I hadn't even noticed because the eczema that bothers me most is on my face and neck, and it hadn't cleared as a result of her treatment.\nAt the end of May I decided to try the flax oil and borage seed oil. It's been about six weeks since I started, and am starting to notice results now. My skin on my face and neck is actually soft! It feels moisturised from within, and although some parts are still red, the skin is soft and elastic, and I no longer wake up in the morning taut, flaky, and itchy! I apply moisturizer to my face and neck once in the morning, and it lasts almost all day, where before I had to do it several times a day. I don't even put it on my legs, except once after my shower at night. I have also eliminated all dairy products from my diet, eggs, and junk food. I feel so much better and am able to get more work done each day. I have not used steroids on a regular basis for the past 2 years now, although I keep a little on hand for emergencies.\nThis is what has worked for me. I hope it works for you. Anyway, it involves no steroids or anything harmful, so it's probably worth a try.\nBTW, heat and sweat also make my skin crazy. So does Indian food (spicy). I take walks in the evening too to avoid flares. And I have always showered everyday. It's the ten minutes I look forward to all day! All derms say not to, but I find moisturiser is best when applied when the skin is nice and moist. Also if your legs are really dry, maybe you should apply some oil while in the shower. this feels really good. And honestly, in retrospect, all derms I've been to have produced a short term recovery at best (read: completely useless). Maybe you don't need to see one. I haven't been to a derm since 4 years ago.\nDate: 5 Jul 1997 From: Elizabeth Subject: e babies\nI've written a few times about my now 8 month old son, Isaac, who has suffered from severe eczema since 2 1/2 months old. We've had a horrible time managing his symptoms and have tried practically every cream on the market. I understand that topical products treat the symptoms but as Shelley recently said, it feels hopeless at times to look for the source of the problem. Sometimes the only way I can stay sane is to accept the eczema as part of our lives and to make my son as comfortable as possible.\nEven so, this is an extremely difficult thing to do. During the entire course of his illness we have only had one clear reprieve and that was a couple of weeks ago when, because he was so infected (he was biopsied and found to have a strep infection on his skin), he was put on Zithromax. His scalp and face eczema cleared up like magic, only to return when the 5 day course ended. Our allergergist told us to put him back on the antibiotic for 10 more days. Warily we obeyed. However, within a few days his face flared again and he looks infected. So much for overreliance on antibiotics. We have no idea for sure what caused the flareup (A/C, something I ate and transmitted to him through breastmilk?), but it is certainly depressing this 4th of July weekend to watch him suffer. We have sworn off steriods ointments but I can tell you I am very tempted to use a little Elocon or Westcort on the very bad spots. My husband disagrees and feels the steriod ointments are mildy effective at best (he still seems to itch) and that once we stop them Isaac flares up again. So I am restraining myself...\nMy questions: Everyone seems to have varying stories about the effectiveness of dietary retrictions. The only thing Isaac eats is Neocate (an expensive elemental formula made entirely of amino acids and no large proteins) and breastmilk. I've been on a diet avoiding allergens which came up on his RAST test. Now I think it might be a good opportunity to wean him (I have resisted due to the emotional comfort the breast seems to give him) because then we would give him only Neocate for a couple more months until we would begin introducing solids. Any advice about this?\nSecondly, I'm interested in the possibility of adding some things like EPO or Flaxseed oil to his diet. Can I put this in his formula safely? I have been taking EPO myself but I don't think he breastfeeds enough for it to have a therapeutic effect. Anybody have experience introducing vitamins and oils to babies at this stage and in our case, when the baby hasn't begun solids?\nLastly, about cortisone: have people noticed a \"rebound\" effect when they've stopped using steroids suddenly. Do other parents have the problem we do of constant infection (ie. during a flareup the skin not only turns red but also becomes wet and weepy). How do folks deal with this without the use of constant antibiotics and steriods? I worry that if we don't treat the infection it will spread to his blood or to his internal system. By the way, we are also using Zyrtec daily to help with scratching.\nJust for the record: Isaac is a firstborn, is quite sturdy (22lbs and only eating formula and breastmilk). There is no hx of eczema or allergies in either me or my husband and only mild eczema and hayfever in my husband's family. None of Isaac's cousins (all at least 4 to 7 years older) have allergies. Interesting because Isaac's allergies and eczema are quite severe.\nDate: 5 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: Birth Order\nNot me, I'm the third child and no ones compare to mine.\nDate: 5 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: fixing up your insides\nTell her steroids are probably still the most effective (not best) way to treat a symptom of eczema but not eczema itself.\nHow strong is the steroid? How much body coverage? If you don't NEED steroids and other treatments are effective, stick with the other treatments.\nI'm still working on all the little things that are going wrong in our bodies that are related to this disease, these are the things we need to fix but being able to identify disfunctions and knowing how to correct them are 2 different things. The point I was trying to make was, you can put all the crap in the world topically on the skin and you will still have the disease tomorrow. I trying to get rid of it, not make my days easier by putting a topical on but BTW I must as my body is steroid dependent but I am working on getting my adrenals back.\nDetox is a huge consideration of this disease and yes this is part of what I'm using currently in the forms of colon cleansing (which I hate with a passion but I know it's effective, so I continue) and liver flushing. I'm on week 3 and will do this for 8 weeks straight and then every other week for maintenance.\nDate: 5 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: e babies\nWhen introducing solids avoid any and all animal fats and limit animal meat. For the body to able to produce inflammation it needs Arachidonic Acid and the number one source of this is animal fats. Diet plays a role in any disease, in our case, it's not just about food allergies.\nGLA is the active component in these supplements that we take them for but our bodies can produce them there selves and mother's milk is good source for GLA, so without taking any supplements, he is getting this already. Consult with a Naturopath (a truly licensed one) as to how much.\nDate: 5 Jul 1997 From: Sage Subject: DH and update on Nathan\nGrass definitely triggers my eczema. Mainly kentucky blue grass. This was especially high on my allergy test. Bermuda grass doesn't bother me, but doesn't grow where I live. I'm going to try to plant fescue soon. For now, since I live in a new house, I just have dirt. But when I go to a picnic or park I try not to have direct contact with the grass. Sometimes just sitting above it in a chair can get me itching or turning red. I hope you can find some alternatives for play for your son. It's tricky. When I was young I didn't have the grass allergy so I can't offer much in the way of ideas.\nDate: 5 Jul 1997 From: Cindy Subject: e babies\nOur 12 1/2 mo son has had eczema since he was 6 months, mostly on his feet and ankles but occasionally spreading/spotting elsewhere. We are in round #infinity (or so it seems) for getting it to clear up so we can then try to identify the source. Because it isn't a severe (as in all over his body) problem, we think maybe we can find the source, but who knows? We've just started our quest seriously to get to the bottom of it.\nAbout 3 weeks ago, Nathan's was so thick and looked like it could be infected. Our pedi had us use Bactroban to help fight infection. We haven't used an oral antibiotic.\nWe are using Triamcinolon for Nathan. We did an 8-day round of it and it got considerably better but didn't clear during the 8 days. We stopped using it after 8 days to let his skin *rest* (per instructions) but on day 10 it was already getting worse again. We took him back in to let the pedi take a look on day 12. He switched us to the Triam. ointment (we had been using creme) and he said use it till it clears and then one more day afterwards. Nathan's minor spots on his wrists, elbows and back of knees have all cleared (within 3 days) and his feet are just about better. This is day 17 (so it's day 5 of the Triam. ointment). I don't want to continue using steroids on him, but I figure since it's working, if we can get it to clear in the next 5 days, then we'll have success... but if it flares back up after it clears and we stop the steroids, then I want to find something else (i.e., find the source) to get it to clear. (Am I being overly optimistic?)\nWe use aquaphor and also have just started using Eucerin to help keep his skin lubricated and that seems to help with scratching. Also we put him in footed jammies at night and he doesn't seem to scratch, tho as soon as they come off in the a.m., he starts to scratch if we don't get the ointment on him fast enough. When the itching seems to not be controlled with the ointments/lotions, then we use Atarax, but we don't have to use it very often and one dose seems to take the itch out for him.\nNathan is also first-born, was breastfed till 8 1/2 months (and then only because we're pregnant again and he weaned himself), and eats a limited variety of solids. No history of eczema for me or DH, tho my mother has a skin disorder that isn't eczema but has similar symptoms and treatment.\nDate: 5 Jul 1997 From: Jolie Subject: to: Elizabeth & Isaac\nPerhaps I already wrote concerning a pediatric gastroenterologist, he helped my son go from 90% eczema coverage to 15% with in 4 days. He was on a very strict diet and some medication but now he eats 20 foods and his eczema is limited to knees, hands and feet. We all sleep at night.\nDate: 5 Jul 1997 From: Elaine Subject: sick and tired\nSorry all, but I just need to vent. I spend so much time trying to take care of my skin that I know some of my efforts work against me. Like my face - I HATE the pealing and flaking. I rub the dead skin off so hard that I bleed. Then my skin gets so dry. I'm ready to totally give up. I know that my hot showers that I turn to for relief only make things much much worse but for that instant or two I find pleasure. It's summer and that means my activities are limited. Heat and humidity are my number one enemy.\nDate: 6 Jul 1997 From: Karen Subject: asian kids and eczema\nI'm Filipina, and have had eczema all of my life. On those few occassions when I went home to visit family in the Philippines with my parents, my eczema completely disappeared. From what I was told by my derm, many other Filipinos have eczema, but the condition doesn't usually come out until they come to the US. Like Mary wrote, diet could probably effect my eczema as well. What I ate in the Philippines is much different than what I eat here, much of it was less affected by pesticides and less processed (free range chicken as opposed to eating chicken that's lived most of its life in a cage in some warehouse). I'm 22 now, and my eczema has subsided only because of the summer weather and because of steroids. Hopefully, my eczema won't be as bad as it was when I was a child. But we can only hope, right? That's my two cents. Oh, by the way, does anyone know of shampoos that are really gentle that don't aggravate eczema on the ol' scalp?\nDate: 6 Jul 1997 From: Shannon Subject: Happy socks\nI have a 17 mo old granddaughter with eczema - it appears in the folds of her elbows, her face and back of neck. On this digest (I think) I saw a hint that has worked for her arms. We cut off the toes of white cotton socks, and after splashing a little water on the bends of arms, slathering with some lotion recommended that starts with E... ?? (sorry, can't remember, and I'm not at her house where the lotion is), then we slip the socks on her arms. She wears the socks (sockies, to her) all day, doesn't try to take them off. In fact, one night she woke up about 4 am crying because of the itching, asking for \"sockie, sockie\" - her mother put on the sockies, and she went back to peaceful sleep. We had read that just the little amount of pressure that the socks apply help relieve the itching, and it sure is true with little Carley. The socks are really cute as sleeves sticking out from under the ends of her shirt sleeve. Try it on the little ones, and the bigs ones. We are really pleased how this relieves the itching, keeps the area clean and out of the sun, clears up the redness and swelling, and makes the baby happy. Yeah!!!\nDate: 6 Jul 1997 From: Cindy Subject: Happy socks\nProbably Eucerin lotion. We've just started using that with our 12 mo old and it seems to really work. That's a great idea with the socks. He occasionally gets it in the folds of his elbows so I'll have to remember that for the next time.\nDate: 6 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: Steve/Cataracts & Eczema\nI have had cataracts since teenag-dom. Eczema since 6 months age. Am 60 now and they are developing slowly. Mostly right eye. My mom has them too. She is 87. She had one removed and a lens replaced. All doctors have given me the same information about them. Eczematic people have more cataracts than others. Steroids advance the process more quickly.\nDate: 6 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: cetaphil lotion\nCetaphil lotion for cleansing does not contain lanolin.\nDate: 6 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: No scratching. No eczema ?\nMy dermatologist told me long ago,that If I didn't scratch I would not have eczema. I think there is a lot of truth to that, but it eliminates the violent allergic reactions that are effected entirely by allergens.\nDate: 6 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: fixing up your insides\nHi Kelly, I use Elocom only on my face and neck, and the derm said that it probably wouldn't thin out my skin and would not get absorbed into my adrenals. I hope she is right! I broke down the other day and gave into using Elocom, and so now my skin is beautiful. If only it would last! (sigh!) I am tapering the treatment to see how long I can be off it without using it.\nI really don't want to be steriod dependant, but I do break out when I'm not using topical steroids, and so far, I have found nothing that really clears it up, other than Elocom. You spoke of other effective treatments. Can you suggest any? Some people have been mentioning Grape Seed Extract, and I'm thinking of giving it a try. I have to admit that I'm weary of the Naturalist approach after my experiences with my old naturalist, but you're not about to rip off a buck from a desperate patient, and so I'm happy to try anything you might suggest. Also, could you tell me what liver flushing is?\nFinally, you mentioned that animal fats allow the body to produce inflammation. Are you a vegetarian then? Or, are there certain parts of an animal that you avoid, and certain parts that are safer?\nDate: 6 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: asian kids and eczema\nI am Chinese but I was born in the US. My eczema is quite severe now but not until 5 years ago. I also had it bad in my infancy. For what it's worth, 4 of my friends have eczema who are also Asian (1 Korean, 3 Chinese). Only one of my non-Asian friends have it. Of course, this is biased b/c I now have more Asian friends than not! I have also heard that Asian skin is meant for the typical Asian climate : hot & humid.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: Liver cleansers\nAfter using steroid creams for many years and noticing the visible thinness of my skin occurring and my ability to fight allergens (especially from any kind of perfumed product) diminishing, I decided to take another course of action. I discussed these issues with doctors and eventually managed to get myself down to 1 and 1/2 percent hydrocortisones, taking about 6g of evening primrose oil a day (about 600mg of GLA I think) and went under the sunbed every now and then to relieve the soreness. I no longer use a sunbed as it could cause other problems and I reduced the intake of evening primrose oil to a minimal amount.\nI was really pleased and although I had to be careful about the products I used on my skin and watch my diet everything was fine, until recently...\nMy eczema started to worsen and, being summer, so did the hayfever and asthma. I decided to do something to help. I read that sometimes if the liver isn't functioning properly it may be something to do with the liver. About a week or two ago I started on a dose of antihistamines, milk thistle, evening primrose oil (only 3g a day), aloe vera juice, 3g Chorella (building up slowly) and linseed (ie flaxseed). The only problem is that my skin appears to have worsened. I was just hoping whether someone may have had similar experiences and whether I should eliminate one or more of the products or if this could be a sign that my body ridding itself of toxins.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Corinne Subject: asian kids and eczema\nI'm filipina and have had eczema all my life. My eczema disappeared during my teen years, but ever since I moved to the City to attend college, it came back with a vengeance. Like Karen mentioned, I think the change in climate, vegetation and eating habits are big factors. My eczema is worse during the winter months (can't wear wool), and whenever I visit Hawaii it dramatically clears up. Diet is another culprit. Now that I'm on my own, I've found it harder to find and cook those rice and Philippine vegetable dishes. My eczema usually subsides in the summer months, but this year it's become worse. I think it's due to working all day in a dry, air conditioned office.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for immediate itch relief in an office setting? I immediately feel better when I step out into the humid summer air, but I can't take these relief breaks that often.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Susanne Subject: Ingredients for Balnetar Bath Oil.\nThe ingredients for Balnetar Bath Oil are as follows: Coal Tar 2.5% in mineral oil, laureth-4, lanolin oil, PEG-4 dilaurate, fragrance and decusate sodium.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Carrie Subject: e babies\nElizabeth, my daughter who is now 7 1/2 also has eczema and has had it since she came to us from Korea at 5 months. She has been quite severe at times but is getting better as she gets older. I too did not want to use steroid creams but find that if I do dab just a little on spots when they appear - it goes away and she is much more comfortable. I also found from this list that baking soda baths really do help her. They soothe her skin and offer at least a short relief from the itching. I also double rinse all her clothes and wash her white clothes in hot water. I also learned from this list that airconditioning units can hold mold and then it comes into the house when you turn on the air.\nWe did and do not restrict Sam's diet but she really doesn't eat much junk - she prefers fresh fruit to cookies and cakes. I did find that artificial colors and dyes in soda such as orange soda do cause her a problem if she drinks too much. Chocolate and nuts are not friendly to her skin either. Sam also has Asthma but that has been under control for quite a long time without the use of steroid sprays or medicines. We use cromolyn sodium daily and albuterol when she gets tight or weezy. I know what you are going through because I spent many nights holding her because she hurt so much and there was no more cream in the world I could put on her.\nSometimes I would put her in a lukewarm bath (sometimes at 1:00 in the morning) and that would provide some relief to her. We also found that benadryl would help the itching and let her fall asleep but can't use that anymore because of her asthma. As I said her eczema and asthma is under control now but only I think because she is getting older and I limit her stress and make sure she gets enough sleep. A routine seemed to very important in the management of her eczema - if we were out late or she got overtired it seemed to flare up. I could always tell when she was a baby when she was going to get sick because her whole body would become inflamed and a day later she was sick usually with bronchitis. I hope this helps and hopefully your baby will get better as mine did.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Carrie Subject: Allergy Tests\nYour pediatrician can do a blood test and then send it out for an allergy test called a RAST test or you can go to an allergist for the skin prick tests.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Jodi Subject: Steroids and the body\nI have nummular eczema- little round patches on my legs and arms. I have recently quit using my steroid cream after my OBGyn said it was not good to use while trying to get pregnant. I just wondered if anyone knew how long the chemicals stayed in the body. I was using a potent cream twice a day, although I wasn't using a lot.\nI also wondered if others had heard about or tried essential oils. I am using lavender oil right now in place of steroid cream. I use it in a carrier oil. It has not made the eczema disappear, but it is not as red and itchy as it has been on the steroid cream. It is almost as if the steroid cream was irritating the skin too! Anyway- I wondered if anyone has had success with other oils. Thanks for the information. I have learned more from this list than from my derm.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: scratching a habit?\nHow many of you find that you scratch even if you're not itchy?\nSometimes, when I get anxious or frustrated, my first reaction is to scratch. Night time scratching is the worst. Even if I'm not itchy, my fingers still want to go nuts. Taking red clover capsules, and staying up until I'm so exhausted that I fall asleep right away seems to help.\nI wonder if eczema-prone people are also generally people with strong habits. Thinking about it now, I used to have a really bad habit of biting my nails. It was about the time when I got braces and was forced to stop that I started to scratch instead. I'm thinking of trying to develop another habit (not a bad one!) to replace the habit of scratching. I guess this sounds like a crazy idea, but perhaps I can teach myself to respond to anxiety/frustration, etc. by twiddling my fingers or playing with a small ball instead of scratching.\nHowever, there are times when I get eczema even where I haven't scratched, so I don't know if it's completely true that if we didn't scratch, we wouldn't have eczema. But, of course, scratching does aggravate eczema.\nBrigit, how is playing with your little ball helping the itch, lately?\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: Depleted Adrenals/Kelly\nKelly, Could you please share with us some ideas on how to \"get your adrenals back\"? I, too, am steroid dependent, having taken oral prednisone for 13 years straight (a major mistake). I just got off it this past spring,and my drs. say it can take up to 2 years for my adrenals to come back. In the meantime, I am having various aches and pains, allergies and infections that I believe are a consequence of my present cortisol deficiency.\nDoctors also say there is nothing to do about helping the adrenals except to wait it out. However, the alternative health lit suggests various things such as ginseng and glandular supplements. I would be grateful if you could let us know what you have discovered in your research about supporting one's adrenals, and what you do personally.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: Asian Eczema/Japan\nSome people have suggested that eczema in people of Asian descent is aggravated by their living in the US/Canada. But I have read (in Andrew Weil books and elsewhere) that there is a high incidence of eczema in Japan. They apparently have developed a somewhat successful treatment there that involves bathing in and drinking water from a certain spa (in Japan), combined with some kind of mind-body intervention (visualization or hypnotherapy, I think). It sounded promising, and an extra-added great reason to visit Japan.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Heather Subject: happy socks\nI find that if I lie on my back on cool cotton sheets when my back itches, the pressure makes it feel better. Also helps, sometimes, to put on a snug-fitting cotton tank top or t-shirt. For this same reason, I remind my fiance when he touches me too lightly that it tickles, and makes me want to scratch. A firm (but not abrasive!) touch feels better.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: e babies\nOur baby Christopher is 7 months old and has had eczema from almost the minute we brought him home from hospital. He too is in the middle of a bad flare up of dry eczema and we can relate to the stress and the feeling of being unable to help him in anyway (or so it seems!). We just feel so helpless watching him scratch and itch until he bleeds. I believe that when the eczema is just beginning to break through the skin then steroids can help - short term. I have not used them for a week, and to be honest, he doesn't seem any better or worse without them.\nWhen it turns weeping & sore -- I managed to speak to a dermatology nurse (very old fashioned) who told me to put 1 tablespoon of salt into 1/2 pint of very warm water and apply to area with a compress and bathe for ten minutes, then apply a very good emollient cream. It seems to work by drawing all the 'nasty' out of the skin and seemed to work just as well as antibiotic cream.\nWith regards to diet, the dietician said that a few children will benefit from Soya milk, but if a difference is not seen in a few weeks, then this will not be of any benefit at all. I've just started Christopher on solid foods and I've noticed that foods with acid things in them, like lemon juice etc., will redden his skin on contact.\nTo stop a very bad itching session, we have applied calamine lotion straight from the fridge - this really helps to cool the skin down. I would like to know if it is safe to give flaxseed oil with formula milk, and if you can apply evening primrose oil direct to the skin or can 7 month old babies have it mixed in their milk? Does anybody out there know?\nWe are about to embark down the alternative therapy path of Homeopathy (after being given three large tubes of steroids and three large tubes of antibiotic cream by the doctor, \"to keep us going for a while\"). The Homeopath and I had an hour and a half consultation and she is now preparing a remedy for Christopher to take tomorrow. I feel really nervous about this but maybe it will be the thing to sort him out.\nOur son is the second child and we call him Mr Sunshine because he is nearly always laughing & smiling and we love him to pieces. Just remember - there are lots of us in the same boat with the same worries and extended sleepless nights - it is nice to share it with somebody else across the world. Last word, I promise, the way I see my Christopher is grotty skin, but perfect in every other way.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Steve Subject: Steroids and the body\nI wondered if anyone has had success with other oils.\nFor the past month I have been using Jojoba oil on my face and just once a week a small amount of 1/2% hydrocortisone. Though not an essential oil it is non irritating (for me anyway) and is highly moisturising. I just need to find something for my body.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Steve Subject: scratching a habit?\nYep. same here. Scratching is become an instinct I'm trying to get out of. Mmmmmmmmm. I have tried to start the habit of biting my nails to keep them short but I have failed many times.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Rita Subject: Jodi - Asian E Baby\nJust to report that Jodi is now 95% clear. She is sleeping through the night and her skin is the best it has been since she broke out with eczema at about 3 weeks old. She'll be 16 months tomorrow and has 17 teeth altogether. She's drooling a lot because a molar just cut her gum and her skin around her mouth and face is slightly red deal to her drool but not eczematic anymore. I'm happy to report that she is 85% in height and 25% in weight in terms of growth.\nI truly believe I have found a cure for her. Being an Asian baby, with my ancestry's diet and eating habits so different from most American diets, dairy and junk food being the major ones, Jodi broke out with eczema around the time when she was first introduced to baby formula. [Chinese eat mostly rice, leafy greens, lots of fish, fresh fruit and very few junk food, of course bad cases of eczema can still be found in China and I now know why.] I nursed her till she was about 7 months old and from than on, her eczema was totally downhill. After the Elocon side effect, I realized that treating her from the outside was useless. I started her on Chinese herbal treatment when she was about 6 months old but didn't get her to a good herbalist with the best herbal mixes available until she was 9 months old. She was so much better the month and a half when she received that intensive Chinese herbal treatment in China, though I still could not find a satisfactory explanation why the herbs helped her until now.\nI remember my older one developed a form of rash when I supplemented her with baby formula the same time as I did with Jodi but the rash lasted for only about 2 weeks and she never has any problem with eczema after that. So, when Jodi had it, I thought it was just a matter of time, not knowing what I was getting myself into.\nYou see, Chinese herbal decoctions are very bitter. So, I disguised the decoction in her formula. Big mistake. Dairy product, not being the main group of dietary element in Chinese food, caused Jodi to react terribly to it. When I took dairy away from her, her eczema was 80% better. In the process of cutting dairy out of her diet, I stopped consuming dairy myself and found out that my sinus problem for the longest time disappeared. Who could have thought that the problem rooted from me, the mother? I always want to believe that eczema is JUST a result of bad genes, but that is just too convenient.\nWe all know that eczema is a combination of things. I began to ponder what is causing the rest of the 20% to flare. Playing detective for more than 14 months, I'm beginning to get good at this trade. I looked back on my notes and Jodi's condition and began to see the connection. Recently, I've ventured in to a new avenue to treat Jodi with parasites, kind of similar to colons cleanse but with more emphasis on the balance of intestinal flora than cleaning the build up on the intestines. Jodi being never exposed to any oral antibiotic or oral antihistamine convinced me that something very wrong in her intestines before she was born is causing her to flare up. All this time when she has her herbal mixes and extracts, she never has an ear infection or any constipation(she has good bowel movements at least 2-4 times a day, every day).\nYou see, the herbal mixes and extracts I use now are very bitter, just like the Chinese herbal decoction. It's just that Jodi doesn't need to take as much in terms of fluid oz. It began to dawn on me that part of the bitter herbal decoctions were used to kill the bad parasites, which I believe, are the real causes of her eczema. No wonder my older one has no problem with eczema - I was on Chinese herbal decoctions, which was slightly bitter, for general health before I was pregnant with her. I didn't have time to take any herbal decoction before I had Jodi. I believe Jodi got the parasites from me when I was pregnant with her, which means that I did not have a balanced flora when I was carrying her. I can still remember vividly symptoms of parasites which I thought was just a normal course of pregnancy.\nThings are beginning to make more sense now. That explains why when the first round of quality herbal mixes killed off her parasites, Jodi was so much better. Unfortunately, as soon as she was back with our baby sitter who has 2 dogs, she was reinfested again. Therefore, with me feeding her dairy without the use of Chinese herbal decoctions (not yet realizing the connection between eczema and dairy immediately after our return to the States), her eczema started all over again.\nI always wonder - when someone pays so much attention in the food one consumes, how can there still be so much toxins in the body? Where did the toxins come from? Now I know the answer to my question. To top it off, antibiotics and hormones in meat and pesticides in produce etc. in our diet are elements that are very difficult to get rid of with a society so vested in quick results. It would be ideal if I can grow my own produce and raise my own livestocks but... well... at least there are organic alternatives which are sometimes available and affordable. From now on, I'll make sure that raw meats are cooked thoroughly, water is boiled, hands are washed often etc. and parasites maintenance is a main part of my family business.\nWell, just a long note from a mother who's been combatting this eczema business for 16 months. Noticing and knowing the different between typical American way of lives and where my ancestry came from, I certainly hope that Jodi will benefit from it and be well soon. I have a feeling that when Jodi has a balanced flora, she is not going to react to dairy as much as she does now. We'll see. Next time when I order a dish of bitter melon in a Chinese restaurant, I know that I'm actually taking a preventive medicine used in ancient China to combat parasites and I'll probably enjoy it much better than before.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Glenn Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nHas anyone heard any good or bad things about Aveeno/oatmeal cleansing bar or the Aveeno mosturizing lotion? This bar is mainly made of Oatmeal which is supposed to being an anti itch substance.\nDate: 7 Jul 1997 From: Rebecca Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nMy son applies Aveeno oatmeal lotion immediately upon finishing his shower. Of all the lotions he's tried so far, he seems to like that one the best.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Samantha Subject: liver cleansing\nI had a severe reaction to a cleansing diet I went on. I ended up out at the hospital crying for some cortsione after 5 or so weeks of not sleeping from the itch and the pain. I could not go on any longer. Although I can't be certain, I suspect that I was malnourished from the diet.\nI have never tried Aloe Vera juice but it aggravates my skin if I apply it topically.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Brigit Subject: Mary-- scratching\nMary, The little ball does indeed help, but only when the itch is not too severe. You know how sometimes the itch comes from within while there's nothing wrong with the skin? That's when distraction helps.\nNow, here's what my book says (you may remember I got this book that's very strong on not-scratching and habit reversal): They say scratching is TWO phases, first you reach for the itch, then you scratch. So in order to reverse the habit, you do TWO substitutions: instead of reaching for the itch, you clench your fists as tight as you can, counting to 30; then (ONLY if you still feel the itch), you PINCH the itching spot hard.\nThe reason this does not work for me is that the eczema is on the palms of my hands, so clenching my fists is for me the same as scratching...\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Yolande Subject: Asian skin and Asian climates\nI'm Chinese by race. I live in hot and humid Asia and I have had eczema since infancy (about 29 years now). The humidity makes me perspire and that makes me itch, so I don't really know if a hot and humid climate is all that good for me. Perhaps the humidity here is too high-almost 90% at times. On warm but dryer days, I found my eczema was not causing so much irritation. But warm, relatively dry days are very few and far between.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Rebecca Subject: Steroids and the body\nI am into herbs and essential oils heavily. A few days ago, someone asked for a good moisturizer that didn't feel so \"heavy.\" I recommended that person try Jojoba oil. Glad to hear you've been using it for a while and like it. As for the rest of your body, you might want to try almond oil. It is another potent light moisturizer!\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Jolie Subject: to: Rita\nRita- is there a resource for your information on intestinal parasites? What is the product you are using on the baby, the diet and the length of time for results.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: Pill\nI wrote about the liver cleansing yesterday and I think my skin's slowly beginning to clear up. I take linseed (flaxseed) in seed form and sprinkle it on salads, fruit, cooked dishes and in yoghurt. I don't know whether it has the same effect as the oil - but the taste's a lot better!!\nMy main point today is about the pill. I take a brand called Minulet which contains gestodene. However I've heard that there are brands that can aid different conditions (eg acne) and was wondering whether anyone had taken a particular formulation and think that it's actually helped the eczema.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Linda Subject: Ups and downs\nChristine, I think you wrapped up a lot of feelings expressed on the list recently and offered good support/advice. I agree that we must not focus on the downs or hard times. Think positive and don't let our eczema consume us -- it's just part of our flesh. But we ARE more than flesh after all.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: fixing up your insides\nMary, If you're using Elocon, you won't become dependent from its strength. But you're still in contact with the allergen.\nMy all-time first choice is Pau d'arco and secondly is Licorice Root.\nThe liver controls toxins and we have too many (normal for people with allergies) it becomes overloaded and cannot neutralize then fast enough as to not cause the body harm, so if you flush the liver, you unload it.\nNot anymore a vegetarian but I don't eat red meat. The main part to avoid is the fat but just because you can't see the fat doesn't mean it's not there, take skinless chicken is still 20%+ fat and for milk, 2% has 36% fat.\n>> About a week or two ago I started on a dose of [snip] The only problem is that my skin appears to have worsened. <<\nEliminate all and start over, introduce one by one, you just put several chemicals in your body at once, introduce them slowly with at least a week in between introductions to see if you do react to one of them. Even though everything that you are introducing are good minus the antihistamines, that's a lot for the body to take at once.\nThere's several things you can do to \"get your adrenals back\" if they aren't dead yet. I tend to like raw adrenal glandulars but make sure it is raw strictly. Do your adrenals hurt, this is actually a good sign? Also Pantothenic Acid [B5] is a good choice.\nFind a new doc. I'm not saying this because he said there was nothing to help but because he mislead you and let you and made you steroid dependent.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Linda Subject: Baby improved/ summer heat\nKim's words were very encouraging. I can also say that since finding out Brian's allergies, he is 10 times better than he used to be. Since we got rid of pets, changed daycare, changed formula to Alimentum, eliminated all food allergies, baking soda baths, Brian has had tremendous improvement. Yes, he still scratches sometimes, especially his eyes/face when tired, and also his hands. But when I think about how severe he was just 2 mos. ago, he has come a LONG way. The difficult thing is that my in-laws have 2 cats and 1 dog (previously our dog) and I've noticed that every time we're at their home, Brian starts rubbing his face/nose and gets VERY congested and itchy. So obviously my mother-in-law can't argue with me any longer that he IS highly allergic to cats & dogs.\nI wish I could say the same for me. My skin is worse now, so I guess I'm one of those eczema people that have it worse with the summer heat, and probably due to environmental allergies. I have severe allergies to all outside grasses/pollens/trees/etc. I am not outside very much at all, mostly stay in AC, but still my eczema is flaring up and spreading. I have been getting allergy shots weekly for about 9 mos. now to help alleviate my sinus problems from these allergens, but I have to wonder if the shots are contributing to my eczema in a negative way. Any wisdom/experience would be appreciated.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Priscilla Subject: Aveeno, etc.\nI bought some Aveeno cleanser and a bottle of Aveeno anti-itch lotion, which contains calamine and other ingredients. I've been washing with the cleanser and am not sure if this has really improved things, but the anti-itch lotion has been the best product I've tried in a long time for being completely sucessful at relieving my itching, and thus scratching, which has been discussed as a big part of the problem. Several very raw looking patches on my arms have cleared up about 80% just from this effort over less than a week (and being more conscious of not scratching).\nI started getting eczema when I was 17. I'd get a really big breakout of it during the spring, then it would go away. Over time, it's become more chronic, but not as widespread. Steroid creams have only worked for me for a few days, then I'd have a \"rebound\" breakout which was worse than the initial. So I've slowly concluded that the current \"Western\" medical answers to this problem aren't helpful for me. Stress is a big factor. I'll have eczema for months, then go on vacation for 2 weeks and have it go away completely, then have it return the first day I go back to work. Hmmm.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Linda Subject: Socks on arms/hands\nI just use infant/baby socks over my son's hands to try to prevent him from scratching his hands and face. Sometimes his hands and wrists get very itchy and he'll scratch and rub them on anything (especially carpeting). However, he pulls them off in 2 seconds if he really doesn't want them on. I also worry about deterring his motor skills, etc. if his hands are covered during the day. Hmmm... maybe I could try cutting a small slit in the sock to free his thumb. What do other moms do/have done? Did you keep the socks off for learning purposes and let them scratch as long as they didn't cause bleeding? I try to only cover them when he's *really* itchy and at bedtime.\nMary and others, I do find myself sometimes scratching even when not really itchy. My first response when I get up every morning is to scratch while on the way to the shower. Or to scratch when awoken by my son for a bottle in the middle of the night. I think it's a habit just like eating is to someone overweight. They eat, gain weight, get depressed, and eat more! In the same way, we scratch, eczema gets worse, we get depressed, and scratch more! Sounds crazy I know, but I think most of you can relate.\nI liked Shelley's idea previously of a squeeze ball or something like that to keep the hands busy. I know that sometimes I just scratch to keep myself occupied. I don't think I know what it means to sit and really relax. If I'm sitting for a long period of time, I'll start to squirm and can't sit still. This nervousness (whatever you want to call it) then comes out in scratching especially if I can't get up and walk around. Hmm... maybe I need a little less caffeine (Hah!). I really do try to watch how much caffeine I intake.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Sue Subject: Rating Steroids\nDoes anyone know anywhere on the internet where I can find ratings of different steroids? I have three different prescriptions from three different doctors and have always wondered how to find out which was stronger than the others so I could use the lowest one first. The three medicines I have are Diprolene, Westcort and Psorcon. I always assumed the Westcort was the lowest since the doctor who prescribed the Diprolene gave me Westcort to put on my face when I needed it instead of Diprolene, but that's just my assumption.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Nancy Subject: Rating Steroids\nI just found a helpful site at http://lib-sh.Isum.edu/fammed/intern/steroid.html\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Sue Subject: Aveno Lotion\nI have used the Aveeno oatmeal cleaning bar in the shower and found that it made me a little bit itchy and dry skinned, so it's not always among my favorite soaps. I've never used the lotion. However, I do find their anti-itch cream to be excellent for hand excema when it's blistery and oozing--seems to dry it up and stop the itching.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: oils and moisturizers\nRebecca, I was wondering if you have ever tried Emu oil. I have read that it has helped some people with their eczema and is a potent moisturizer and carrier. I have tried Jojoba oil and it dosen't seem to \"last\" on my skin. Plus, I think my skin might be sensitive to it b/c some places wouldn't heal until I stopped using it. I don't know if it is b/c of the jojoba oil or not.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Mallika Subject: UPdate\nDoes anyone know of any good sunscreens that are non irritating. I thought of using Lubriderm or Neutrogena. Sound good?\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Suzannah Subject: Steroids and the body\nSteve, Have you tried aqueous cream - its nice on wet skin as a body moisturiser. I've also used a Boots hypo-allergenic baby oil in the bath to very good results on dry skin.\nThose are both mineral oils and you may want to avoid them. But you could try sweet almond oil - its a bit cheaper than jojoba - I find it a bit lighter - the jojoba is a bit irritating when the skin is not healed.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Suzannah Subject: What's working / sodium cromoglycate\nI am feeling very pleased as my skin is healing beautifully around my mouth and is not getting irritated again.\nI'll tell you what I'm trying:\nI'm avoiding all suspected foods (but not 100 pc strictly - as in eating them as a minor ingredient) - I've done this up to now with limited success even on complete avoidance - possibly I've passed the hypersensitive stage of elimination?\nI'm taking zirtek - non-drowsy antihistimine for hay fever - I think that stops that deep itch.\nEvening primrose, multivit and mineral, vit c, extra zinc.\nUsing sweet almond oil, aqueous cream, emulsifying oint, jojoba and vaseline on skin.\nAdditionally I am using a few drops of Opticrom (sodium cromoglycate eye drops) a few times a day. This was a result of discussion a few weeks ago on this chemical. Has anyone else tried using this for any length of time?\nI have one niggling doubt - I have been using Elocon - stong? steroid on my hands for a couple of days. My doctor assured me that this does not pass through to the rest of the body - but could that be the reason for the 'cure' - if so, its not so great.\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: David Subject: AVEENO CREAM\nGlenn asked about Aveeno products. His query, and a reply, mentioned Aveeno Lotion. I'm not familiar with an Aveeno lotion, but Aveeno Cream (Manufactured by Rydelle, distributed in Britain by Bioglan Laboratories) is my mainstay, and I can't speak too highly of it. It is only available in 100ml tubes in Britain, though I believe a 500ml size is in fact manufactured (in Italy.) The product is a soft, easy-spreading cream, roughly the colour of porridge (and smelling ever-so-slightly, and not unpleasantly, of porridge, too!).\nIt is based on colloidal oatmeal, and the packaging lists the following ingredients: Water, glycerin, distearyldimonium chloride, petrolatum, isopropyl palmitate, cetyl alcohol, dimethicone, Avena Sativa, benzyl alcohol, Allantoin, sodium chloride. Avena sativa is the oat plant, and Allantoin is a substance derived from Comfrey (Symphytum Officinale). When I started to use emollients, and joined the National Eczema Society, at the time when my atopic tendency really manifested itself in eczema, I obtained numerous samples of emollients, and tried them all, some for extended periods.\nOf all I tried (excluding steroid creams) it was immediately apparent that, for me, Aveeno was ahead by a mile. For me it seems to possess a mild but definite anti-inflammatory property in addition to its non-greasy and non-occlusive-feeling moisturising ability. I get it on prescription from my G.P., and have been using it for a couple of years now. I have tried to be a little 'scientific' and done some experimental controls, where I've treated one side of the body or one arm with Aveeno and the other side with something else (eg diprobase or aqueous cream). I've also tried leaving off Aveeno altogether and using something else, for a couple of days. Each time, the result has been the same: Nothing works nearly as effectively as Aveeno. As an added benefit, since the film it leaves is not greasy, it's pleasant to use on the face. Because of the consistency of the product, it is quick and easy to apply all over the body. I have been intending to write about this for a while, but have delayed till now as I have been trying to investigate the properties of oatmeal and have been (& still am) awaiting information by email from Bioglan Laboratories and/or Rydelle. (Both have websites, so perhaps if a few more write with inquiries, we might get some info.) I'd be very interested to know of others' experiences with this product, and to confirm if it's the same as the Aveeno Lotion Glenn refers to.\nI have also used the Aveeno Oilated bath sachets and the oatmeal cleansing bar. The bath sachets are rather expensive and one can easily do a home-made version with a cloth full of fine oatmeal in the bath (and, if desired, a little oil added to the bath water too. You can help the oil to disperse by mixing it in a jug with warm water and a little hypo-allergenic shampoo, before adding to the bathwater. I use soya oil from the supermarket, which is considerably cheaper than commercial dermatological bath oil products which are basically the same thing. Don't take risks, though, if your skin is extremely bad, or if it's a young child.)\nChanging the subject, today I picked up the book that Brigit recommended (Atopic Skin Disease - A Manual for Practitioners. ISBN 1 871816 32 7) and I'd like to second her opinion that it's really excellent!\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Wendy Subject: What's working / sodium cromoglycate\nMy derm gave me a list of different steroids and their strengths based on a scale of I being the most potent to VII which is the weakest. Elocon ointment is a II and Elocon cream is a IV.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Wendy Subject: E around mouth\nI have been having a problem around my mouth too. I have been tested for a bunch of food allergies and came up with nothing so I don't think that that is the problem. Recently I asked a question re use of Cutivate on the face. The reply said that it didn't have the same harmful effects but not to use it around the mouth. Does anyone know why? Or is it just the absorption factor? Also, should I just give up completely on any form of Chapstick, Blistex, etc? And last but not least, what kind of toothpaste do you guys use?\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: Emu oil, exfoliating, media coverage\nTo everyone who wanted to know about emu oil: I first saw it mentioned in some description of a moisturizer. Supposably, emu oil is a powerful moisturizer and is a good carrier of other ingredients into the skin. This could all be b.s. but I was interested anyway. I then did a search on the internet for \"eczema treatment\" and emu oil came up. The URL for this site is: www.hubofthe.net/emu/bene.htm There are tons of other sites selling emu oil but I think this one in particular mentions eczema. I have not tried it myself b/c I haven't found anywhere that carries it (other than the internet). Check out that site and other emu oil sites and tell the group what you think.\nMy next question concernes exfoliating dead skin. My skin gets a TREMENDOUS build up of dead skin and I don't know what to do. I try rubbing it off gently but sometimes I rub too hard and screw up my skin even worse. If I don't rub hard enough, it doesn't come off. I find that if I just leave it alone, moisturizers can't penetrate well, I have to moisturize a lot more times during the day, my skin feels very tight and dry, and my skin itches more. Does anyone know how to exfoliate gently yet effectively?\nLastly, why hasn't eczema been given much media coverage? It really pisses me off. Maybe we could write 20/20, Dateline, or some other news program and have them do a report on eczema.\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Jeannette Subject: Socks on hands/arms\nI have a son who had eczema beginning when he was 6 weeks old from head to toe. At first I thought it was baby rash but then it never went away. I started putting baby socks on his hands when he got really itchy during the days and all the time during naps and at night so that he wouldn't scratch himself raw. The socks were just a way of life and he got used to them. I tied them with a tie around the wrists (not too tight) so that he wouldn't pull them off. He is now almost 11 and still sleeps with the socks. The socks keep getting bigger as he gets older!! In fact, he won't go to sleep without them because it doesn't \"feel\" right. His eczema is better now although by no means is it gone.\nThe socks have not impaired his motor skills. In fact, he takes piano and is doing quite well. I had eczema when I was a child and my mother tied my hands. My motor skills were not affected either.\nDate: 8 Jul 1997 From: Jose Subject: Liver cleansers\nI have had an eczema patch on the shin of my right leg since September of last year. The patch is about 1 inch wide and 2 inches long. I do not want to use steroid ointments topically on the area.\nThree weeks ago I visited a doctor who practices alternative medicine. He said that I was not getting complete digestion and when the undigested food reached the large bowel, gas and toxins were formed due to bacterial action on the undigested food. He suggested I take digestive enzymes and I should notice a difference in three weeks. I used the Solgar product labeled 'Vegetarian Digestive Aid' (I have been a vegetarian for two years).\nI did notice a difference after the first week. The area changed color from bright red to a brownish red. The itching almost totally stopped and the scales of skin that tried to overgrow the affected area stopped. The area seemed to be healing from the \"inside out\".\nUnfortunately, I have stayed on this plateau and have not noticed much further improvement. I started doing some research and found that a malfunctioning liver can cause skin problems. Two days ago I started taking Milk Thistle, standardized to 60 mg. Silymarin per capsule, two capsules three times per day. Two days is too soon to expect any dramatic results although I wish there were some. I also take Evening Primrose oil and Flaxseed oil as part of my normal, daily nutritional supplements.\nIn addition to the Milk Thistle, I have started taking an infusion (tea) made from Wild Yam (Dioscorea sp.), Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) and Hops Flowers (Humulus lupulus). These are mentioned by a countryman of yours, David Hoffmann, in his book, The New Holistic Herbal.\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Faith Subject: Emu oil, exfoliating, media coverage\nDunno if this will help you at all, but I throw it out as a suggestion: if you go into your local drug store, hunt around in the skin care aisle for a \"Buf Puf\" cosmetic scrunge thing (a white or off-white spongy-looking thing) or a loofah. Try using them gently on your skin for a week or two, see if they help you exfoliate the skin without doing damage. I use a Buf Puf to help keep the acne on my face down to a manageable level, and find it also work well as an exfoliant in eczematous areas.\nLet me just hazard a guess as to why eczema doesn't get much media attention -- too many folks know too many other folks who had a little tiny itchy rash that was called \"eczema\", and they can't understand how that little tiny spot could be life-threatening (as it has been in the case of folks like Kelly and I think Shelley), or even so much as health-threatening (as many others who have had their eczema get infected, or worse, have had). They hear \"eczema\", and that little rash patch picture pops into their head, totally driving out whatever the television is trying to show them of people with more severe cases. Or else they figure that those more severe cases are a real rarity, and \"that will never happen to me or anybody *I* know!\"\nOf course, that's just a guess...\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: Liver cleansers\nThanks for your advice. I think that introducing so many different supplements at the same time gave my body a bit of an overload, so I've cut down to milk thistle, evening primrose oil and linseed in addition to my usual antioxidant.\nThe idea of of incomplete digestion is an interesting one. I often feel bloated and gaseous as if there's food sitting on my stomach. I'm not a vegetarian but I do not eat a lot of meat. However I do go out a lot and often eat fatty foods late at night. I've always been called skinny but recently have acquired what I feel is a bit of a pot belly and always seem to have indigestion. Is the Solgar treatment available over the counter in England do you know?\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: Linda/allergy shots\nDuring my nine years of dealing with eczema, I tried two times to take allergy shots. My first round was perhaps 7 years ago, and my second round was 2 summers ago. I know that when you first begin taking allergy shots, your eczema is supposed to get worse, and then eventually get better. But both times, in my case, the eczema got worse and worse until I was forced to stop the shots. My latest allergist told me that allergy shots don't work well with eczema patients and that the shots do make the eczema worse.\nI hope this doesn't upset you. The shots may work in your case - everyone seems to have slightly different causes and treatments for their eczema. My 2 cents worth advice is to hang in there and hope that the shots do help, but if after a few months they dont, try something else.\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: opticrom and vaseline\nI asked two derms about using sodium cromoglycate. Both said that they had never heard of it being used topically. One derm said that she was not impressed with it either as an pill or as an eyedrop.\nI haven't tried it yet, but I am curious about it. Have you tried using the sc without elocom?\nAlso, you mentioned that you are using vaseline. I used to use vaseline a lot, until I discovered that it only made my face redder and hotter. Vaseline clogs the pores and does not allow the sking to breathe. Perhaps you might want to try a mosturizer that makes your skin feel cool. Neutrogena gives that effect.\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Tina Subject: socks on baby's hands\nI just wanted to say that Daniel does better without socks on his hands at night. When we were putting socks on him, he would wake up with blood all over his face from what looked like rug burn from the socks. He does better if we just keep his nails short. He may also be sleeping better since he is getting older, but we sure are getting more sleep in this house than we were just a couple of weeks ago!\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Karen Subject: Elocon\nMy daughter's derm told me that if a person uses Elocon on the same spot daily over about 6 months, it will permanently turn the skin in that area red. So he cautioned me to use it very sparingly.\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Nadine Subject: Toothpaste, etc.\nJust wanted to mention the experience I had with fluoride toothpaste. I had been using it for some time and I started to break out around my mouth. My Derm said it was from the fluoride and that the cream I had been using on my face for a fungus outbreak also had fluoride in it! I immediately stopped the fluoride toothpaste and the cream. It is very difficult to find a toothpaste without fluoride but I was able to find one called \"Natural White\". I had to take a course of tetracycline for a month to get rid of the fluoride that the Derm said had accumulated around my mouth... he said the tetracycline was not being taken for its antibiotic properties but to carry the fluoride out of my cells. My face is finally cleared-up and if I start to break out I just use a little tea tree oil skin ointment and it seems to clear up right away.\nI have also been using Aveeno Anti Itch lotion when I have a patch of eczema show up and it really does seem to work. So far this summer the only eczema I seem to have continually is under the elastic of my panties. I try to buy only underwear with the elastic covered by cotton, but I still break out a little.\nI'm curious too... how many people with eczema also have hypothyroidism?\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Patsy Subject: Suggestions Please\nWhat does anyone do who injures an area that already has eczema? I needed to wear a band-aid today, and it drove me crazy. Are there bandages that aren't as bad as others? I'm really looking forward to anyone's ideas.\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Melinda Subject: Temovate\nI just finished using Temovate Emollient cream for 4 weeks. It's the first thing that successfully and totally cleared up my legs in two years. (No more sores, no more itch! Yes! I never thought I would see the day! ;-). Other steriods and therapies did not help. My derm told me it was a very strong steriod to be used for short periods of time, but she did not give any warnings about it. What are the probable side effects?\nAlso, the pharmacy messed up and gave me Temovate cream instead of the Temovate emollient cream. The emollient cream works *much* better and is less smelly than the more powdery regular Temovate. I see the derm tomorrow for hopefully the final visit for a long while. (Yes, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.) I plan to ask why the different style creams have different effects on me when they both have the same active ingredient.\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Elizabeth Subject: emu oil\nA woman at my work who knew about our struggle with our son Isaac's eczema, brought me a sample of emu oil along with a testimonial and order form. She told me that a friend of hers with severe eczema used it and got immediate results as far as itch-stopping. He continued to apply it without much effect on the rash but over time he said that it also helped the rash. We have tried the sample, usually whenever desperate, on Isaac with no result whatever. It doesn't smell, seems harmless and applies like any oil. Here is an excerpt from the testimonial: \"Emu oil is a member of the lipid family, like any other fatty acid that is derived from an animal. Lipids, or fatty acids are made of carbon chains. A carbon is the basic building block for all organic compounds. How these carbons are built and bonded together detemine the nature of the lipid. Unlike so many synthetic compounds made in the lab, emu oil in its purest form is a natually complex compound showing significant potential use in many types of applications. Both laboratory testing and actual use of the oil in various type of products on humans have shown emu oil to have desirable characteristics and effective results.\"\nApparently an Emu is a bird, closely related to the ostrich. There is a farm in Massacusetts which breeds these birds and sells the oil. Here is the place: Arrowhead Farm and Apiary, 416 Bay Road, Amherst, MA 01002 tel 413-253-9769. 1.3 oz of the oil is $15.00. They claim 100% satisfaction money back guarantee on all products. Hope this is helpful and let us know if any of you has success with emu oil.\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: fixing up you insides\nPau d'arco and licorice root are supposed to be taken daily but I have found that anything taken daily ends up ineffective eventually. For me I take them (or just the Pau) right before, during and after my period as this is a hard, hard time for me but if I was looking for regular routine, I would do 5 days on, 2 off or 4 on, 2 off.\nYou take them orally, I tend to like everything in extracts (not tinctures), this way I have better control over the dosage, that you don't get with pills.\nPau d'arco is an antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, it kills our little buggies. We with eczema have higher than normal staph counts at any given time, this includes times when you won't have any physical signs of eczema, your count will still be higher. This has always been a very overlooked part of our disease until we get an infection then they like to give you an antibiotic.\nLicorice Root (not the deglycyrrhizin type) is an antiinflammatory and antiallergenic, it does this partially by supporting the adrenals so they can work more efficiently.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: emu oil\nThanks for the info about the emu oil. I didn't really think it would help \"cure\" eczema, I just wanted an alternative moisturizer. The moisturizers on the market contain tons of ingredients, many of which I have no clue (however, I am starting to learn about a lot of them). I figured emu oil sounded like a good replacement.\nDate: 9 Jul 1997 From: Suzannah Subject: Pill\nSarah, I am very interested in this point - are you saying that you think your pill helps your eczema? I have read that the pill really messes up your system and alters your metabolism and hormones so that all sorts of food intolerances etc can occur.\nI would not trust my own doctor to be very interested in this point as he believes I should just learn to live with it.\nAmongst other big 'life events' my eczema got bad at around the time I went on the pill, I have been considering coming off it, but don't really want to - I'm hoping to have got enough other factors under control not to need to.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: Pill\nAmong other things I've been very bloated and irritable since I started the particular combined pill that I'm on and I think these factors can contribute to the eczema. I tend to scratch even when I've not got an itch purely out of frustration.\nI went to the clinic last night and told the doctor about all my trouble and she said that the pill itself should not affect the eczema. So I reckon it may just be a chain reaction. However she's put me on a new pill which still contains the same amount of oestrogen but coming from a different source. The pill I was taking contained gestodene and this new one has it in the form of norgestidol (I think that's more or less what it's called!!). However I will let you know the results. The problem is that pills affect people in different ways and I suppose it's to do with out genetic make-up how we react to them and whether they are beneficial to other aspects of our lives. As with all remedies it's a case of trial and error which eczema sufferers often become very disheartened about!!\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Donna Subject: Suggestions Please\nI always have problems with the plastic strip bandages, and in the past only could use the fabric strips without getting a reaction... but I've found I've been able to use the new 'sports strip' style, too...\nYou may have to make your own, using a square cotton bandage pad and hypoallergenic paper tape.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Donna Subject: Thyroid\nWhen one is hypothyroid, one usually is ALWAYS hypothyroid... I would suggest going to an endocrynologist and being retested.\nOf course, many years ago it was common for pediatricians to prescribe thyroid supplements for children who were even slightly overweight... a practice which is no longer followed... so many adults who remember having to take thyroid supplements as children may in fact not have had a hypothyroid condition.\nBTW, if I haven't answered the first query already, I DO have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, which results in a hypothyroid condition... it was first diagnosed when I was 29, I probably had been suffering with it for a good 6 or so years before it was diagnosed -- but I never had a problem as a kid (neither did I have eczema or any other allergy as a kid... )\nMy eczema started a few years after my thyroid condition was diagnosed, and there's a definite relation to my consumption of cow's milk (but not an EXCLUSIVE relation)... again, I never had any allergies, especially to cow's milk, as a kid...\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Tom Subject: Getting off oral steroids getting your adrenals back.\nI have been off and on oral steroids for most of my life (44 years). I have now been off oral steroids for over 2 years. When I first tried to go off them I kept having flare-ups. My reduction went from 75 mg/day to 50 for 1 week, 25 for 1 week then 15 mg. for 1 week, 10 then 5 for 1 week, then finished. Almost immediately I flared up. I discovered that my adrenals weren't producing anything. It was suggested that my reduction needs to be even slower and smaller increments at the lower doses. I went back to 50 for 1 week, then 25 for a month, 20 for a month, 15 for a month 10 for a month 5 mg for a month 4 mg for 2 weeks, 3 mg for 2 weeks, 2 mg for 2 weeks, 1 mg. for 2 weeks.\nThis gradual reduction allowed my adrenals time to get going. I got off the oral steroids and except for 2 separate 1 week bursts over the past 2 years I have stayed away from them. Because my adrenals are working again I can eat small amounts of things I am allergic to and get away with it. I take inhaled steroids for my asthma and use steroidel creams on a sporadic basis. For the itching I use either cold or extreme heat to stop it. I take \"Reactine\" (Zyrtec in the US) also for the itching and it does a good job as long as I am careful and don't overdo eating the wrong things (milk and milk products, most fish, nuts, certain fruit). It can be real tough but I wear glasses today because of cataracts growing as a result of long term steroid use. You ladies are at higher risk for osteoporosis as you get older than us guys, but steroid use multiplies that risk dramatically.\nIt isn't easy to get off them; it takes time, work and itching but the other health benefits are really worth it. I suffered with different joints that used to ache off an on. I wore orthotics for a long time for my feet, I couldn't even throw a stone or ball properly because my shoulders ached so much, my knees ached as well. Since I got off the oral steroids my joints have all cleared up and I feel great.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: liver flushing/cleaning\nA few years ago, I went to a naturalist who told me that I had to clean up my liver, and so every week for a year, I went for hydrotherapy, which was supposed to get rid of the toxins in my body. For the incredible amount of money my parents spent, it didn't seem to help much.\nNow, what is the difference between liver flushing and cleaning? I have noticed that my eyes are a little on the beige side, instead of white. Someone mentioned that is a sign of liver problems. Do other people with eczema have beige eyeballs?\nAlso, you mentioned that Pau d'arco is an antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic. I heard that eczema is caused by an overactive immune system. Now, if our immune systems are hyper, wouldn't they kill bacteria, fungi and parasites one their own? When my eczema was really, really nasty a few years ago, I rarely ever got sick from a virus, and I always assumed it was because I had a hyper immune system. Do you know if it is true that our immune systems are over-working?\nI'm not doubing your advice to try Pau d'arco, I'm just trying to understand why we have eczema. I'm definitely going to give it a try.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: fixing up you insides\nLiver cleansing is a slow process, much gentler than flushing which dumps a lot of bile and toxins at once. My choice for flushing is castor oil, then I follow up with colon cleansing 6 hours later to remove all of it.\nMilk Thistle can be classified as both, it is still by far the number one choice for supporting and rejuvenating the liver.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: hypothyroid\nI had hypothyroid when I was 12, and was treated for a year.After the treatment stopped, and just before I turned 14, my eczema began to get really bad. Coincidence? I wonder...\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Sage Subject: emu oil\nI have been using grapeseed oil for the past couple months as a moisturizer. I really like it. It is very affordable at my health food store as well. Occasionally I'll augment the grapeseed oil with almond or jojoba oil. I bathe in baking soda and try only to bathe every other day--or to shorten my baths.\nI have all over body eczema which has been very debilitating emotionally and physically since my four year old was in utero--but for the last six months or so it seems to be under control. Now my eight month old son is getting really red patches on the backs of his knees and he's learned to scratch his legs on the carpet as he crawls. This is indeed a frustrating condition.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Sage Subject: fixing up your insides\nKelly, you mentioned that your period is a hard time for you. This is an awful time for me too. I guess I'm fortunate in that I am nursing my baby still and have not started again. But pregnancy also makes my skin crazy. Have you ever tried Julius Roth foundation's creams? They are an England-based non-profit foundation. I found them on the web during my pregnancy and their therapy oil, cream and gel helped my stay sane through the remaining five months of pregnancy.\nI have wondered if other eczema sufferers also have irregular periods. I was recently tested for thyroid problems, since I have so many of the symptoms, but the test was negative. Is it just eczema that causes irregularity?\nAnother question I have is if all other eczema sufferers have digestive troubles. It certainly seems so. And I believe what others have said about eczema being largely due to ineffective digestion--among other things.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Sage Subject: exfoliating, media coverage\nI've found this thread interesting as my eczema has been so debilitating for 4 years. People do not know what bad eczema is like. I thought what Faith said about other people's reaction to eczema is very true. Many have little spots on their bodies that their dermatologists have called eczema. I just don't believe that what many people suffer with and what we (those with the all over body stuff) have is the same thing. I wish the derms knew more and cared to know more so that we could at least get some research help.\nI also disagree with the notion that if we didn't scratch we wouldn't have eczema. This is garbage! Even when I have no active spots of eczema on my whole body, my skin is not like other people's skin. Only recently with giving up aquaphor for grapeseed oil has the redness eased up on my skin. But I'm still contstantly battling my itching, dry skin. If this is the same disease that afflicts the small spots on other people's bodies someone needs to prove it to me.\nSorry about the griping. I just wish some derm had helped me even a little. I just don't even trust them anymore--or respect them where eczema is concerned. Not one ever suggested food allergy connections when I was younger. Etc. etc. The last one I had, I kept telling him I didn't want any steroids because they just made me flare up worse. He just kept giving me more steroid prescriptions. And he had the gall to say that I would soon be writing him a thank you note because he would clear it up! I was the one suffering and working each day to overcome it. I stopped seeing him.\nI do wish we could alert derms and media and others to this disease and seek help. It seems like there are so many pieces to this puzzle. If only we can work together to put them together and find relief from this.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Sage Subject: Toothpaste, etc.\nMy parents used to brush with baking soda and salt. You might try it sometime. It's extremely affordable.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Shelley Subject: Tying up hands\nI'd be more concerned about the psychological effects. When I was a child my parents tied me up to stop me from scratching, and it was the worst thing for me mentally. I am still effected by it, at 40 years old. Perhaps if you only do it briefly it wouldn't be so bad. My parents did it every night for years. It made me scratch harder and more furiously as soon as I got out of the restraints, and created a terrible pattern of suppression of scratching followed by frenzied scratching.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: Adrenal Insufficiency/Kelly (More)\nKelly, Thanks for your answers. I have some follow-up questions for you. Regarding raw adrenal glandulars, do you know a reliable source and how much to take? I was always wary of such products because of concerns with the health of the animals they are taken from (some have suggested that the donor cows could have undetected mad cow disease or somesuch). It would be nice to know if there were conscientious and careful suppliers of this stuff -- e.g. organic cow farmers. Are there any \"vegetarian\" glands?\nNo, my doctors never said that there was a possibility of my adrenals not coming back. They considered that on 10 mg. a day of prednisone, they probably did not shut down completely in the first place. However, towards the end before I gave it up for good, I was frequently overdosing on the prednisone without my doctors' knowledge (I would hoard it up during good times, because I felt my doctors would not prescribe larger doses as frequently as I thought I needed them). That might have screwed up my adrenals for good.\nYou ask if my adrenals actually hurt, and imply that is a good thing. What do hurting adrenals feel like? And why would that be a good sign? (Does it mean they're not dead?)\nFinally, I *did* change doctors. The ones who told me that are not the ones who prescribed it in the first place. They were just stating the possible consequences (and patting me on the back for having quit).\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: Emu oil & Media coverage/Shawn\nI've seen emu oil sold at health fairs and herb fairs (I think there are emu farms in Texas; they also market emu burgers).\nFaith had some good ideas for why eczema has not made the headlines. Another possible reason is that perhaps eczema is perceived as icky, like leprosy. Carpal tunnel syndrome is OK because it doesn't make you look ugly; also because it is caused by working at a computer which (1) is relevant to a lot of people, (2) is a cool thing to do, and (3) you might be able to sue your employer for.\nIf a certain amount of media coverage could lead to destigmatizing eczema (like a public service announcement saying, \"this really isn't contagious, you know\"), then that would be a good thing. But you know how the media are; they might try to sensationalize it. I don't think they ought to do a big \"sympathy\" story, since that's not what we're after.\nI wonder if more research is not being done on eczema not because the public is not so aware of it (even if they were, would non sufferers be pushing for more research?; as Faith said, \"it will never happen to them\", and it is not contagious like AIDS, so why should they care?), but rather because it is so elusive and unresponsive to standard medical intervention that researchers feel frustrated and that the payoff is not large enough relative to the effort they would have to make. (sorry about that dense sentence). After all, just the term \"atopic\" denotes that they have no idea what the cause or the cure are. I think there would have to be researchers who truly want to think in more unconventional terms rather than barking up the same standard trees of conventional dermatological wisdom to make a quantum discovery about this disorder.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: Flaxseed/Sarah\nThe references I have read to flaxseed other than the oil imply that it works best if ground up (e.g. in a coffee mill) and then sprinkled in cereal or other things, or even drunk in water. I think unground flaxseed is probably a good laxative, but possibly the omega fatty acids & lignans are not released as well in that form.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: flaxseed oil, evening primrose, borage oil\nIs there really any difference between flaxseed oil, evening primrose, and borage oil? I compared the three and they basically contain about the same. I heard of evening primrose being apply topically, can you do that with flaxseed and borage?\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Megan Subject: pill\nHi all, There is a new brand of pill out that is supposed to also clear up severe acne, I saw an add for it but I cannot remember the name- it did not claim to have an effect on any other skin conditions.\nAs to the pill and eczema, I have been on and off the pill several times and have never noticed an effect on my eczema, although I never stopped taking the pill for more than 6 months, which maybe isn't enough time to see the effects of it.\nHowever, a homeopath I went to stressed that I should discontinue the pill because he felt that it was a major contributor to a buildup of toxins in the body, which he felt either caused or strongly contributed to the eczema.\nI decided that the stress I kept putting myself through worrying that I might be pregnant while I was not on the pill was worse for me and my eczema than being on the pill, so now I am back on it.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Megan Subject: emu oil\nOK, maybe I'm a softhearted liberal, but I would want to know more about the process they use to get the oil from the emus before I used it on my body.\nOn a more cautionary note, I would think that those of us who react badly to lanolin should also be careful with emu oil, since they are both animal byproducts rather than plant derived products.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: David Subject: oils\nI've never heard that Flaxseed oil contains Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA) which is the part of the other two which is thought to help eczema sufferers, according to what I have read.\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Steve Subject: Everchanging weather\nI would like to discuss how my eczema is affected, not so much by whether it is hot, cold, windy, or rainy; but how often the weather changes. In the UK we can see all four seasons in one day.\nThe UK had a pretty lousy June. It just rained and was cold for the time of the year. Last week it all changed and is now hot (well hot for us Brits) and humid. My eczema went berserk last week. This is down to my body not adjusting quickly enough to the change in weather. At the moment I feel uncomfortable in this heat. However if this weather stays the same for the rest of the summer then I know I will get used to the heat and my eczema will settle down. Fat chance!!\nI have lived in places that have pretty settled weather, compared to Britain, and on all occasions my eczema was very very minimal. In one it didn't exist. Does anybody else agree with this? Or maybe explain in more detail why my eczema does flare up when there is a change in the weather.\nAs much as I love my beautiful island I do not think it is the best place for my eczema. I am seriously considering moving to a country that has definate seasons. I would love to hear from anyone who has moved for similar reasons and have found a benefit, or even disagree with anything I have said.\nI know I have mentioned this before but my main allergies are dust mites, certain molds, cat and dog dander. Now all these are prevalent in the air I breath in. I GOTTA MOVE!!\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Steve Subject: My disease is worse than yours!!\nWhen I had eczema aswell as asthma when I was a kid I was always changing my mind on which one was the worst. Of course, it was always the one that was playing up at the time. If I was having an asthma attack I would wish it would go and I would gladly swap for eczema. The reverse was true when I was in pain because of my eczema.\nWhat I am trying to get at is that if you suffer from a certain condition, no matter how serious or trivial it may appear to a third party, you will think it is worse than another disease. This is because you live through all the discomfort, pain, anger your condition causes. You will not be fully aware of how another disease or disability affects you until you get it.\nI mentioned that I have cataracts in my eyes and that I will have an operation to get rid of this soon. I see this as a minor problem but it made me think to myself that I would gladly swap my sight for my eczema. This was of course a silly thought but it did make think how serious I perceive my eczema to be if I have actually thought about that. Now a healthy person would definately say that being blind is by far a bigger disability than having full body eczema. I couldn't disagree with that but being blind does not keep you up all night. It does not make you mutilate your body and you won't have to look at yourself and see how bad you look. I could go on. Then again I wouldn't appreciate all the things we take for granted with our eyes.\nNB. I have only used blindness as an example and sincerely hope this has not offended anyone.\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Suzannah Subject: opticrom and vaseline\nI have been using elocon on my hands and the sc on my face, but I've stopped using the elocon now anyway. I only use the vaseline very sparingly and just when it 'seems' right and more on my lips than around them.\nI've got Neutrogena, but I don't like the stickiness - I will give it another go next time I need a new cream. I have found I need to rotate my creams and only use each one a very little and then to change.\nI've actually been using these eyedrops around my mouth and then putting on a little sweet almond oil and it feels very nice and hydrated for ages, but not occluded.\nIt does sound really silly to use eye drops, but it is helping and it is not steroids!\nDate: 10 Jul 1997 From: Kim Subject: flaxseed oil, evening primrose, borgage oil\nI use Evening primerose on my son, stick the gelcap with a pin and rub it around. I can't say that it really makes a difference except if he is scratching after I use a lotion, he does not have the itch effect after using the EPR oil. So it is an okay moisteriser for us.\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Jeannette Subject: Tying up hands\nFortunately I never had any psychological effects from my mom tying my hands. She did it for years when I was in grammar school, and in fact, it was kind of a game at night to see if I could get out of them. I've been tying my son's hands for the past 10 years and now he does not like to go to sleep at night unless he has the socks on his hands. His hands are not actually tied together. I tie a shoelace type tie around his wrists to prevent the socks from coming off.\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: opticrom and vaseline\nIt doesn't sound silly at all, I've heard about eyedrops being used to treat spots because it has a drying effect and also being meant for the eyes it will have to be a very sensitive non-irritant formula. So has you eczema dried out?\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: Everchanging weather\nI never really thought about it until you mentioned the difference in your eczema with regard to climatic conditions. My eczema had been pretty much under control for the last few years but the weather hasn't been as changeable as it has recently. I went on holiday to Cornwall for a week at the beginning of June. The air was clean and although it was a bit damp I was fine. However when I came back and the weather started going loopy and the pollution hit me I just turned into a ball of red flakes - my worst in years!! Therefore I agree with your point and feel that it's not only the weather but sudden changes in environment with large influxes of toxic substances that the body just overloads and gets confused and says: \"Hey, stop this!!\" and tries to tell you by reacting furiously on the surface. But what do you do? If I could afford it I would gladly live on some Swiss health farm, but unfortuantely for the majority of us all we can do is try and cope in these situations the best we can with what we've got.\nWhat we need to do is find something that will hope us cope better with these increasingly common changes environment. Everyone, with eczema or not, reacts in someway to unsettled weather but I think ours is more visible and uncomfortable than most.\nDate: 5 Jun 1997 From: Robin Subject: asia/eczema\nMy Chinese daughter had severe, infected eczema when she lived in southern China, cleared up somewhat after coming to Alaska, then got severe again after a few months. For the past 18 months, she has been improving with discovery and elimination of allergens and daily long baths. Improving is a relative term, I guess - she no longer has skin infections, no longer looks like she has a brown mask on her face, but all is not well, so we keep at it.\nToday at The Body Shop I found a soap made only of \"vegetable base\" and tea tree oil, so we shall try that for a while. Anyone else ever try it?\nDate: 5 Jun 1997 From: Robin Subject: exfoliation\nI could never get that rough-skin build up off my daughter until I started giving her long luke-warm soaks in the tub. She soaks at least 20 minutes a day - on days when she wants to and I have the time, this goes up to 1.5 hours. She no longer has that rough skin build up because it softens and flakes off in these soaks - it was odd during the first few long soaks to see all the little pieces of skin flakes float to the surface - the entire surface of the water was covered at times - now it is just tiny bits sometimes.\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Sheila Subject: Do any of you know...\nDoes any of you know how to reduce the effects of cortisone creme?? We applied cortisone for a few months regularly on our baby and now her skin where we have applied has become dark. We did not know then but now we know that it is a side effect of cortisone. But we do not know what to do to get her normal skin coloring back. If any of you know any solution to this problem please let us know. If any of you out there is using cortisone please don't!!!\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Linda Subject: Socks -- to Shelley\nShelley, What do you mean exactly when you say your parents \"tied you up\"? Did they cover you from head to toe with protective clothing so you couldn't scratch, use socks, or what? Just curious about the technique they used.\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Gabrielle Subject: misc\nHYPOTHYROIDISM: I have hypothyroidism. It was diagnosed about 5 years ago. My eczema has not gotten worse or better since I've been taking Synthroid (although my skin as not as dry as it was). To those of you who say that you took thyroid medication as children, I've been told and read that once you begin taking the medication, you never quit taking it. So maybe you should be tested again.\nTHE PILL: I've never taken the pill, and I have full body eczema. I've often wondered if taking the pill would help my eczema, however, after reading some of your posts, it's pretty obvious that it would not.\nDIGESTIVE TROUBLES: I, too have digestive problems. It takes a very long time for food to digest. If I eat after about 6 or 7 p.m., my body seems to be chugging away at digestion for the next 12 or 14 hours.\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Heather Subject: To Suzannah re:Pill, and a bonus question for everyone\nSuzannah, do you remember where you read the information about the Pill affecting metabolism/absorption? I'd be interested in reading it myself. I have irregular periods now which started after several months on the Pill (can't remember which one; I tried several to try to stop the periods-every-two-weeks). I'm not on any birth control pill now, but I am on Zoloft, and wonder if that affects my period as well.\nI find that the cervical cap or regular-strength Nonoxynyl-9 jelly and a condom work just as well as the Pill at preventing pregnancy. I use regular-strength jelly because extra-strength was really irritating. No babies yet! ;-) I will never go back to the Pill, because my worst eczema started while I was on it, and so did the depression that I'm recovering from.\nBack on topic with a personal question: does anyone think that their bowel movements have changed when their eczema has been worse? Sometimes I think that I'm not digesting my food as well...\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Shelley Subject: media coverage\nIf there was media coverage of this, we'd have to come forward and be photographed. I doubt that there's many of us who would be willing to display our gruesome bodies for the world to see.\nE-mail connection has flourished, in part, because of the nonvisual quality of the communication.\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Shelley Subject: weather/Temperature\nMy eczema definitely gets triggered by changing weather. Usually the weather doesn't change much here, that's why I like it, but when it DOES go through a period of frequent changing, like right now, my eczema is much worse. It's driving me crazy at this very moment. And I don't know whether the problem with responding to temperature is actually getting worse or if I'm just more aware of it now.\nAll I can tell you with certainty is that my experiments with temperature over the last few weeks confirm that my skin responds to very subtle changes as well as extreme changes. It appears as if part of the problem is that there is some kind of delay or perception distortion between the skin and the brain.\nLet me give you an example that occurs without even leaving the house: If the temperature is higher in one room than another, I can now feel that my skin reacts when I go into the hotter room. But if I can ignore my skin reaction and just think whether it's hotter, I will think No, it's not hotter. My skin and my brain give me two different messages and the confusion makes my skin realize I'm not listening and it feels frustrated and I start getting itchy and when I scratch, that makes me get hotter, and that makes me more itchy and triggers an itch-scratch cycle.\nThen if I move between rooms, there's a start to cool down but then it gets hot again, and my whole system gets even more confused. And if I put ice on my skin, I will think immediately that the ice is cold, but there's a delay in the amount of time it takes for the skin itself to react to the cold. It takes about half an hour for my skin to actually cool down from direct ice application. Whereas it can take 30 seconds to get hot from a slight temperature increase.\nAt night time, I'm going through a terrible time of trying to adjust to the temperature problem of skin versus brain feeling of hot and cold. My brain likes to be warm in bed. I like feeling cozy under the covers and sometimes can't sleep unless I wear a hat because my head feels cold. But my skin gets too hot. It's so bizarre. I have to have a fan on all night and try to achieve a delicate balance of not too hot and not too cold which keeps changing during the night.\nJust the other night, I turned the fan off because I thought the air was cool enough but then a few hours later I was an itchy mess despite being naked under one light blanket. I realized that despite what my brain said to me, my skin was too hot, and indeed, when I turned on the fan and applied ice, my skin felt much better, but as I said, it took half an hour for the ice to show a real effect. I don't know whether the difference between how my brain registers the temperature and how my skin registers it, is a result of eczema or a contributing cause of it, but for me, there's a definite correlation that exacerbates the condition.\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Shelley Subject: periods & digestive problems\nI have very regular periods, 28 days pretty much like clockwork. I don't think of myself as having digestive problems, but I have to be careful of what I eat. I don't know how much of that is within normal sensitivity or is actually a symptom of a problem.\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Shelley Subject: doctors\nIt would be interesting to put together a list of all the \"my doctor told me\" lines to show how contradictory or just plain wrong they were. We could probably have a class action suit against dermatologists if we had the energy to make a case. My brother-in-law was a dermatologist and he confessed to me that most of the time they didn't know the answers to questions, but would never admit they didn't know. He said that patients needed to believe in the knowledge of the doctor, so it would be detrimental to the relationship to admit how much they didn't know.\nThe thing that amazes me about some of the statements they make is how they generalize. Each case is so unique that I don't see how they can act as if every case will react the same. There's no way for them to predict how your particular condition will respond to a treatment. But they don't want to tell you the truth about how much of a gamble the entire situation is...\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Jeremy Subject: Elocon - Skin Redness?\nThis is the first I have heard of this. How is the skin turned permanently red? Does the Elocon increase the size of blood vessels or something?\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Angela Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nMy daughter is 3 and she has eczema. Has had it since she was about 3 months old. It gets better, but since this last round it has not gone away. We have tried OTC cortisone and Desowen lotion. We also use Cetaphil cleansing bar and lotion. I have taken her off peanut butter (unfortunately her fave food) because of something I read about food allergies. If it makes no difference in about 2 more weeks, I will let her have PB again, but take her off milk.\nToday we bought some evening primrose oil capsules. Doctor said it probably won't be the miracle we are looking for, but it can't hurt. I give her small dose of antihistamine each night so she doesn't itch. She seems worse in the evenings and when she is hot. I remember having something like this when I was a kid. I grew out of it, I hope and pray that she does too.\nDate: 11 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: Linda/allergy shots\nLinda and Mary, I had the same experiences with many years of allergy shots. I got much better after stopping them. In addition to their apparent innate ineffectiveness for eczematics, they were administered sloppily by an unhearing nurse. They should always be injected or \"Over the shoulder\" supervised by the doctor. This nurse would have my syringes all filled up and ready to inject before she ever saw me, or heard of my condition for that day, or consulted with the doctor. Inexcusable.\nDate: 12 Jul 1997 From: Shannon Subject: socks on arms/hands\nThe reason we cut the toes off the socks and put them on the baby's arms was (in addition to interfering with scratching) was to apply a slight pressure to the eczema area which reduces the itching - which reduces the scratching, blah, blah, blah. We never have had to cover the baby's hands because her hands don't have eczema on them. But I think the approach to preventing scratching is to prevent itching - maybe if the eczema on baby's hands could be controlled with snug little gloves. Anybody know where to get those? Our baby Carley has eczema pretty bad on the back of her neck, and we are not looking for a snug little anything to put on it...\nDate: 12 Jul 1997 From: Sue Subject: flaxseed oil, evening primrose, borgage oil\nAs far as I know, Evening Primrose & Borage Oil both Omega-6 oils and as long as you compare how much Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA) you're getting in each, it's pretty much taking the same thing. (Do check the GLA numbers as one can be much cheaper than the other, but it's because of the difference in how much GLA is in it.) Borage Oil is one of the cheaper ones (and what I use); Evening Primrose one of the most expensive (probably because it gets the most publicity).\nFlaxseed oil is an Omega-3 oil. Both Omega 3 and 6 are needed by the body, but I've been told that if you can only afford to take one, Omega 6 is supposed to be the better one since (I think) the body can convert Omega 6 to Omega 3, but not the other way around--something like that.\nDate: 12 Jul 1997 From: Sue Subject: Liver cleansers\nInteresting... My eczema had gotten distressingly bad, and then all of a sudden it just seemed to disappear (other than my hands). My arms were clear for the first time in years, and it was odd since I had not really done anything differently than I had been. When you mentioned digestive enzymes, I realized that about two months ago I had a doctor tell me that I should probably take papaya enzyme tablets after meals since I often had gas/digestive problems after meals. I've been taking 4-6 tablets daily since then and not only am not having digestive problems, but I'm hoping this might be what's helping my eczema. I hope so, since this is relatively easy and cheap.\nDate: 12 Jul 1997 From: Stewart Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nI have heard that the parents should vaccum the babys crib as often as possible and change the sheets, etc etc. I guess this would help build up the infants immune system.\nI'm not saying that the first born usually lives in a pit. It's just that the parents are just learningtheir parenting skills with their first born. Do remember, once the baby is born, no book comes out with the baby.I'm the youngest of four and I have the worst allergy of the four. I guess I bucked the trend.\nDate: 12 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: Shawn/\"Removing\" Dead skin\nRegarding the removal of dead skin: First shower in cool or mildly warm water. Clean your hands and feet thoroughly. Scrub the nails with a stiff brush. Use soap only on these areas. USE NO SOAP on other areas of the body. Gently shower the other areas. Using a personal shower attachment makes things much more thorough.\nAfter showering, try just soaking in a very clean tub of cool to mildly warm water. Stay in the water for at least 15 minutes. Or shower. Just relax in the water. VERY GENTLY stroke the skin with a smooth wash cloth. About 20 very light strokes per area. If you feel the dead skin has not all come off you will be right. It takes a few weeks. Be patient. ( I know. I know.) After your \"Wetting\", while your skin is wet, apply a non-lanolin moisturizer. The moisturizer will reduce the visibility of the dead skin that remains. I find Vaseline good. Some people find that Vaseline bothers them. Gently massage the moisturizer on the wet skin and either let your skin dry off by itself or gently towel dry. If it feels a little greasy, allow an hour or so and the feeling will subside as the skin becomes moisturized. You skin will not feel \"taut\" and dry if it is kept a little greasy. USE NO SOAP WHEN YOU SHOWER. At night repeat but do not apply the vaseline unless you feel you have to.\nIf you see more flaking that bothers you, an electric razor will reduce the most obvious flaking in visible places. Then re-apply some water and a moisturizer. Don't use a blade razor. Be sure to keep the electric razor clean. After blowing and brushing out the hairs, put the cutting parts in the sun. Do this after each use.\nThis may have to be repeated two or three times a day (very gently). Be sure to moisturize. Water removes natural skin oils. Hot water removes almost all of the natural skin oil. Cold water removes less oil but the water is necessary to remove the dead skin. If you are itching and scratching it is primary to stop the itching and scratching. That is another story.\nThe main thing to do is to find the cause of the dead skin. It frequently means the skin is healing from an irritant. If the irritant is an allergy then finding the allergen should be a primary activity in life, in my opinion.\nDate: 13 Jul 1997 From: Angela Subject: questions\nJordan's eczema is so much better after a week of no peanut butter. I have given her 2 capsules of Evening Primrose oil, so I know it's not that. I have also washed her clothes separately this week and double-rinsed. Also used Cortaid (I know, I know, it's a steroid creme), but I used just a teeny-tiny amount twice a day. She said her Cetaphil lotion is starting to burn her legs, though, so I have reduced the use of that until right before bed. Any other ideas on moisturizing will be greatly welcomed as we cannot use Eucerin (it burns also).\nOil in the bathtub seems to be pretty good for her. I am confused, though, on whether to limit her baths, or increase them. I have read conflicting accounts. Anyone know what the safe dosage of Evening Primrose oil is for 3 year olds who weigh about 30 pounds?\nDate: 13 Jul 1997 From: Shelley Subject: Socks -- to Shelley\nMy parents started using gloves taped around my wrists so I couldn't get them off at night. Then when I figured out how to get them off, they progressed to more serious methods including ropes, chains, handcuffs, and strait jackets. I studied Houdini and other magicians and after years, eventually figured out how to get out of everything. Each time I escaped I would scratch myself to pieces in triumph at my success. I remember thinking \"I'll show you! You can't stop me from scratching!\" It established a very firm sense of rebellion in me that exists to this day.\nOn the days when I couldn't figure out how to get out, as soon as the restraints were removed, to go to school or doctor or elsewhere outside the house, I would find a bathroom and scratch myself to pieces in a private frenzy of fury. So the end result of the restraints, whether I escaped or not, was to make me scratch harder and more furiously at my next opportunity.\nI understand that my parents were desperate, but I wish they had gotten some counseling to help them deal with the situation. They needed to learn how to TALK to me about what was going on with my skin instead of just tying me up.\nBecause I had severe eczema from birth, it was as much a part of me as brown hair and eyes. I accepted it as a normal part of myself, because that's all I knew. But to other people, there was something \"wrong\" with me. I considered myself \"a person who scratches,\" so to be kept from scratching, and basically told that I shouldn't be myself, felt like people were implying that I wasn't acceptable enough to pass as a human being. To this day, I have trouble believing that I deserve to live. This is what I meant by saying that restraints had a detrimental effect on me.\nDate: 13 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: thanks for the \"dead skin tips\"\nI have done similar routines to what Howard describes but I get so impatient and want to scrub off all remainders of dead skin I can find. This ends up causing sore and tears, making it much worse. I TRY to be patient but it feels so disgusting having all that dead skin on my body. How can you \"soak\" your face? I've been trying to find a way to do that for quite a while. The best I could come up with is take a long shower and let it spray my face. I guess I could float face down in a pool but the similarites to the dead would surely cause me to be hauled off to the mortuary! Maybe I could use a snorkel!\nRegarding setting the shaving parts in the sun, why? Does it help to kill the germs?\nDate: 13 Jul 1997 From: Faith Subject: thanks for the \"dead skin tips\"\nIf you don't want to deal with a snorkel (great idea! :), how about just taking a washcloth that's been quite heavily soaked in water and not wrung out, and just draping that across your face for a while? If you want to breathe while doing that (always helpful... :), maybe take two separate cloths -- one for the left and one for the right, or one each for top and bottom of the face, and leave a small space at the nose for air to get in.\nYou'd probably want to do this while you're soaking the rest of your body in the tub, as the runoff from the washcloths would likely be a bit much outside the tub.\nDate: 13 Jul 1997 From: Jose Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nSue, Glad the papaya enzymes are working for you. You might also consider taking Milk Thistle seed extract, it's available in gel caps.\nThe liver secretes bile into the duodenum and bile is a vital part in the digestive process. If the liver is not producing enough bile then the digestion problem could be a malfunctioning liver. Milk Thistle is the best herb for repairing the liver. I started taking it a week and a half ago and have noticed an improved, healing look in the area where my eczema is. I am continuing with the digestive enzymes as well.\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: thanks for the \"dead skin tips\"\nFaith, Thanks for the suggestion. Actually I have been using a damp pillow case (for doing \"evaporation\", which I found out on Christine's web page). I find however, actually soaking the skin helps remove the dead layers. I don't know why, but laying cloths, sheets, etc. I guess doesn't really \"unglue\" the dead skin. Maybe I should practice holding my breath :) Anyway, hope your eczema is not flaring up.\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Linda Subject: Skin darkening/discoloring\nThanks for the warning of the side effect of using cortisone creme. I've been using cortisone on my son off and on as prescribed practically since birth. Now I use it on my son's face and a few spots on his body 2x a day for the past month. I was wondering how long you've been using the cortisone creme, the name of medication/creme, where on your baby?\nI am sorry to hear about the skin darkening and grateful for your warning as I've never been told by the derm. that this is a side effect. If I were you, I'd contact your child's dermatologist for advice.\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Corinne Subject: Media Coverage\nThere seems to be a lot of unfair blaming of the media for not producing enough coverage of eczema. I know that there are many factors involving which stories make it from conception to completion. In magazines, the biggest concern is reader interest. Editors won't run a story if their audience wouldn't be interested in reading it. If there is an overwhelming response from readers wanting us to cover a particular story, they would definitely research it.\nAs I write, I am aware of eczema stories being researched and considered, but the difficulty lies in how complicated eczema is to write about. There are so many different angles to approach and explain eczema, and space can be limiting (and expensive). News value is another factor. I believe the reason why CTS has received more coverage than eczema is because CTS was a relatively \"new\" condition. And the purpose of the media is to report the news.\nI do my best to encourage coverage of eczema, but until I'm in a position where I can select and assign stories, there is only so much I can do. As for everyone on this list, you CAN do something. Write a letter to a health magazine, newspaper, etc. Inform publications of your wanting more eczema coverage. People in the media industry are not immune to eczema; it affects us all.\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Linda Subject: Hand restraints/Shelley\nDear Shelley, Being tied up must have been absolutely awful for you -- I can't even begin to imagine what it was like. Now I understand why you write about the psychological effects! I'm VERY sorry you had to go through that. And it must be painful to re-live by answering my question, so I apologize.\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: Do any of you know... .\nSheila, You could try wheatgerm oil as, because it has a high Vitamin E content, it is often used to get rid of scars and also dark circles and crows feet around the eyes. I have very sensitive skin but I can't remember reacting adversely from it. The oil I buy is from the Body Shop and is relatively cheap. You could try it on a small area, as you should with all new products, to see whether there is any reaction.\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Donna Subject: we have found something that finally works amazingingly well\nSomeone wrote: >> We have found a product that actually seems to work that has recently become available. It is called skin-cap spray and it is not a hormone treatment!! <<\nUnfortunately SkinCap is INDEED a 'hormone treatment'... the recent studies in the Netherlands disproved this claim...\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Carol Subject: Web site\nHi Everyone - I found this site completely by accident, looking something up for a friend. But I found it of interest so thought you might, too. It is about skin conditions as seen in movies.\nhttp://itsa.ucsf.edu/~vcr/Dermcin/html\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Marilyn Subject: Dead Skin tips - facials\nI've been thinking about the problem of removing dead skin from the face... this is hypothetical, I'm afraid, since I generally have the problem only behind my ears...\nI have often used steam inhalation to help with colds, and once found a herbal mixture for facial cleansing (various mixtures exist: Swiss Kriss is the only commercial name I can recall). Basically, you boil a large pot of water, let the herbs steep, put a towel over your head and the pot, and breathe the steam for awhile. The steam (especially with herbs, but by itself if as well) opens the pores, and gives your face a mini-steam bath (respiratory passages as well, of course). Now sweat may not be the best for eczema-traumatized skin, but follow the steam treatment with a cool rinse, and it might be an effective way to exfoliate dead skin gently.\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: Eye eczema\nHas anyone else noticed that their own mucus can induce an eczema flareup?\nI have been having quite bad asthma, respiratory allergies and colds this spring... accompanied, miraculously, by the clearest skin I've ever had without prednisone. (Although the Big Three often appear together, I thought perhaps all my \"toxins\" were coming out in my lungs and nose and thus leaving my skin alone.)\nAnyhow, eventually the colds/allergies seemed to go into my eyes and they became very watery and then very mucusy (sp?). At this point, my skin was still clear, including the skin around my eyes. However, as my eyes became more irritated internally, and the mucus kept increasing, my eyelids became cracked and red and eczematous (while all the time the rest of my face was still OK -- no generalized e outbreak, just my eyes).\nMy eyedoc diagnosed it as eyelid eczema, asked me if I had a tendency toward eczema (I was ecstatic that he had to ask, since normally it is so obvious!), and gave me a steroid/antibiotic to put in and around my eyes. After a week, this did in fact clear up the skin almost perfectly and reduced the mucus as well. But it all came back worse than ever after discontinuing the ointment. (At this point, my whole face is acting up, probably due to the stress of defending my dissertation, so my eyelids are just another spot among many).\nWhat I am wondering is, though, did the mucus *cause* the eczema? My eyedoc implied it was the eye skin irritation that led to the eye inflammation, but I know that the mucus came first and only after I had had it for a while did the eczema appear. This leads me to suspect I am \"allergic\" to my own mucus, or that mucus has some chemical properties that make it an irritant. If this were so, I would try to track down what the components of eye mucus are and look for a commonality with other things that I might then avoid. (We are always trying to track down some unsuspected link!).\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Suzannah Subject: we have found something that finally works amazingingly well\nThere has been a huge amount of info on skin-cap - but it has been wiped from the archives as it has been discovered that this product contains a very strong steroid, which is why it works so well.\nI would advise you to discontinue use immediately, this is probably one of the cruelest 'false dawns' you will come across with eczema.\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: Eye eczema from a food?\nHello Lynn, Sorry to hear about your eye problem. To make them feel better, take a lot of vitamin c and a (water soluble A) and D with meals. Rinse them with cool-cold water that has a few grains of salt in it. Or use a drop called Naphcon-A. It is over the counter and is effective at stopping itching.\nI think the stress factor is bogus, especially in your case. I know nothing about being allergic to one's own mucous but my first reaction is, \"I doubt it.\" But who knows.\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: Eye eczema from a food?\nI already take those vitamins, and tried Naphcon-A for 10 days, to little avail. At least, they didn't stop the irritation or mucus, but maybe helped with the itching a little bit. But I'll try the salt water trick (do you keep your eyes closed? or is it like the ocean?). BTW, I read in Prevention that eye itching can sometimes be caused by little mites that live in our eyelashes (yuck). The recommended treatment was to baby shampoo the lashes and avoid putting oils around the eyes, which they thrive in. I don't think mites are my problem right now, but this is interesting to keep in mind.\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: Eye eczema from a food?\nDefinitely keep your eyes open. Flush thoroughly. Just plain cool water in the shower and very gently wiping with a wash cloth will help. With eyes open. But I would shower with water that had not been standing in the pipes for a long time. Same thing for drinking it.\nThose mites are everywhere. Everywhere. It is a good idea to clean the lashes for everyone.\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Beatrice Subject: Evening Primrose Oil\nThere is some strong relation between Evening Primrose Oil and estrogen production, which I can't remember exactly. I came across this in a nutrition book that I was browsing. In fact, it went so far as to say to avoid using it (EPO) if you have hormone-affected illnesses, such as breast cancer. Does anybody know anything about this?\nDate: 14 Jul 1997 From: Karen Subject: dead skin removal\nOnce when my skin was flaking terribly, I had an idle thought: how would the pattern of flakes look on scotch tape? I tried it, and found it removes a layer of dead skin very evenly, smoothly, and I am no longer tempted to scratch it off, as the skin aftyer taping is smooth (although a little red).\nI still use this method to get rid of build-ups. I get home from work, tape the areas that need help, then shower right away. I feel much better after doing that, and my skin responds better to moisturizer. If you have large areas, buy packing tape, it's much cheaper. For face skin, use clear scotch tape, packing tape is a little strong, unless you have years of practice.\nDate: 15 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: dead skin removal\nHi Karen, Thanks for the tape tips! I thought it was pretty amusing but I sincerely am going to try it! Don't worry, no blame will ever befall you! I remember as a kid I used to tape ants b/c they would invade the kitchen since squashing them made such a mess. Sorry to gross everybody out. Anyway, I digress. I am willing to give everything a shot once! By the way, I'm 23 also and I know about parents' paranoia about eczema treatments. My mom kept bugging me about taking Evening Primrose Oil, saying she never heard of it, and blah, blah, blah. It does getting REALLY annoying when she has absolutely no knowledge at all about eczema. Well, happy taping. Hope your skin buildup stays low.\nDate: 15 Jul 1997 From: Brigit Subject: SkinCap\nSkin-Cap has been found by many eczema and psoriasis patients all over the world to be extremely effective. So much so, that doubts arose as to the validity of the manufacturer's claim that the product was steroid-free.\nThese doubts resulted in independent testing being performed by a number of organisations in the Netherlands, not the least of these TNO laboratories. In almost every test that was performed, steroids were found in the product.\nSkin-Cap's official line is one of denial, of vague references to research that proves invalid on even superficial inspection, and of various attempts to cover up.\nAnyone whose medical practitioner recommends the use of Skin-Cap should make these facts known to him or her, as the medical profession is still completely unaware of the latest developments.\nAll reports on this matter are in Dutch, as it was the Dutch Ministry of Public Health that started the investigation (and has banned Skin-Cap from sale in the Netherlands). I will try to obtain a reference in English; in the meantime, this notice will have to suffice.\nI am very sorry to have to crush some hopes like this...\nDate: 15 Jul 1997 From: Heather Subject: to Lynn re: eyelid E.\nI've found that when my eyes are mucous-y (from allergies, primarily) I tend to rub them a lot. This irritates my sensitive skin, and then I start itching. The only thing I can really do for the itching is to wash my face in cool water and apply Eucerin or vaseline; I apply Vaseline thickly to the cracks in the corner of my eyes, and also do this to my eyes when I'm going someplace windy (just as a preventitive).\nDate: 15 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: eye eczema\nI too get eye eczema; right now it's under control because I went to an eye doctor and he gave me eye drops for allergic conjuctivitis. People with eczema tend to have mucus build up in the eye and red, irritated eyes and eyelids.Sometimes my eye eczema gets so bad that I have great difficulty opening my eyes in the morning. He gave me two drops - one over the counter, and one corticostoid. This helped a lot, but I know that if I stop taking it suddenly, it will get bad and even worse. I plan to taper the use of the corticosteroid eye drop, just as I am presently tapering the use of elocom on my face.\nSteve, thanks for your advice - I will try out the salt water and let you know how things go. Just a question - what is the generic name of Naphron-A, so I can find it?\nDate: 15 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: dead peely skin\nI too have been looking for ways to get rid of my dead peely skin (mainly on my face) without peeling or rubbing it. Many of you have suggested letting water evaporate on the affected area then mosturizing. I have tried that many times, but it seems to make my skin go crazy with itches when ever I leave water on my face and neck. Sometimes I wonder if washing my face (only with cold water) does more harm than good. At times, I don't wash my face for days, but then I hate the thought of pollutants sitting on my face. Does anyone have a way of cleaning their face without making their skin scream with itch?\nOn a happier note, I have been taking licorice root and red clover, and by golly, I think they're helping. I'm finally sleeping much more soundly without having scratching sessions as I lie in bed.\nHave a wonderful day, everyone. One day, we're going to kick this eczema into ancient history.\nDate: 15 Jul 1997 From: Rita Subject: To Jolie - Alternative Treatment\nI started my search on herbal effects on eczema a while back and read books about herbal healing and the last ones were by Dr. Clark, Ph. D., N. D. and Dr. Jensen Ph. D., N. D. They are not drs. but naturapathic drs. I gave up on conventional medicine in the treatment of eczema a long time ago.\nThe herbal extracts Jodi is taking include a 23 herbal extract drink in a base of pear juice as a overall supplement (invented by Dr. Leung, Ph. D.); green hull of black walnut, wormhood and clove extracts to combat parasites, enchinacea for cold and flu to boost the immune system.\nConsidering Jodi's blood type and ancestry, I make her food which I believe would agree with her based on my research. I am still not convinced that allergy tests are good for her because I believe most of the times it's the chemicals and additives she is reacting to, not the food. In stead of using the test and trial method, I study what food groups were consumed by my ancestry and I take it from there. Whenever possible, I buy organic meat and produce. I prepare her food from scratch since day one which include mainly rice, leafy greens - many only available in China town, artichoke, yam, broccoli, cauliflower, lean meats - chicken, pork, turkey, lamb, fruit - apple and pear, basically the food groups her body takes well and Alimentum, her formula. Snacks are Beechnut's apple or pear and Chex toasted rice cereal and only use them when we are on the road.\nIt took a good 4 months before her body cleaned up the damage done by dairy intakes. She received parasite treatment for 2 weeks at first about 2 months ago and I now give her a dose once every week except when she has a cold or something which tends to lower her immune system.\nNow that my sinus problem is gone (after I stopped consuming dairy), I'm also taking the parasite herbs once a week just so I feel good if the girls want to have a bite of the food I have, which is often the case.\nDate: 15 Jul 1997 From: Laurie Subject: I'm Free of Eczema (finally)!!\nI never had a problem until around 12-14 years ago. I was Dx'd with eczema. Given creams, try. I ended up using 2 different creams, depending which eczema spots I was treating. The round patches located on my upper arms, and upper legs, I used 1 cream. These round patches would burn when ever I was in the sun. These patches would appear with no apparent cause, and the cream made them go away. They would reappear in different spots.\nThe other \"eczema\" patches were located on the side area of each breast, in the hallow, under each armpit. The skin would be dry and flaky, it would get worse in the summer, to the point it would be so dry/cracked, it got painful. Nothing made this heal, or get better. I used a cream with acidic properties. And yes, I tested my bra's and antiperspirants...\nNow, I am free of both kinds of eczema. The skin problems, along with the migraine headaches I've lived with, roughly (and curiously) for the last 12-14 years are gone. I stopped drinking Diet Coke, last November, and both my migraines ceased, and skin cleared up. My guess is that the Nutrasweet was the cause of my miseries.\nDate: 15 Jul 1997 From: Mallika Subject: Mary and eye eczema\nI used to have a lot of problems with my eyes also. I always had allergic conjuctivitis and had great difficulty getting my eyes unglued in the morning. This was a few years ago. During the summer months, when my allergies are worst I use opticrom or vistacrom which requires a prescription. This is good for maintenance however, to get rid of it in the first place the doctor gave me FML which is a powerful steroid. I only used it for 2-3 weeks, then used the relatively harmless opticrom to keep it under control.\nWhen your eyes get really itchy, try ice packs, it really cools the eyes down, and takes the itch factor away.\nDate: 15 Jul 1997 From: Mallika Subject: Try aveeno\nAveeno is great to take away the itch for dry skin because it contains oatmeal. It's expensive, but give it a try. By the way does anyone know of a good sunblock that doesn't irriate their skin. I just bought neutrogena sunblock spray today in hopes of protecting my skin.\nDate: 15 Jul 1997 From: Elaine Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nThe whole flaking dead skin issue is my #1 problem. I find I must check and recheck my face several times during the day to see how much I'm flaking. I think I'm developing OCD!!! I usually have to disappear for 20 minutes at work to a remote bathroom on another floor where I can soak my face and exfoliate, cream up, notice more drying, re-rub my face with a tissue, cream up, on and on and on and on. Then, if all goes well, I reapply my makeup and head back to my office. My coworkers often say, \"Gee, your face looks fine!\" AGHHHHHH - if they only knew how much time it takes!\nI just came home with a new moisturizer - some $40 Clinique product that so far feels great. It's called Clinique Moisture On-Line (not sure about the name - it's not like it squirts out from my monitor... then again, that would be a good idea.) I love seeing the expression on the sales person's face when I tell them I often use vaseline to moisturize!! I'll let you know how it works. At least it's Clinique Bonus Time.. (sorry men, if you don't get that one). Everyone, stay cool and itch free. Keep your nails short!\nAbout the wash cloth thing - I've cut eyes, nose and mouth holes out of an old soft cloth that I then soak in ice water and drape it over my face during bad times. The first time I did it, I immediately felt like \"Phantom of the Bathroom\"! It helps.\nDate: 15 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nYeah, this dead flaking skin thing sucks. I also go to the bathroom every few moments to rub off more dead skin, moisturize, calm down from being pissed of about this condition, etc. What are the ingredients for Moisture On Line (yeah, I know about Bonus Time only b/c I have been looking at department store moisturizers for the past few months in desparation of drug store ones not working to well). Anyway, I think I can construct a whole new person from all the flaking, dead skin I have peeled, rubbed, exfoliated off! He will be a great, admired superhero and will be called Ex-Man. Yes, he will stop villains in their tracts by bombarding with dead skin, making them itch until they have disintegrated and then the world will be free! Okay, I'll stop.\nEczema self esteem tip of the day: Since it is summer time all of us blend in b/c everyone is sunburnt! Now, the key is to tell people \"yes, I got this sunburn laying out in Jamaica (substitute with your choice of exotic vacation). However, this will only be fun if you can make them JEALOUS! Then, you go off laughing to yourself.\nDate: 16 Jul 1997 From: Brigit Subject: water hurts\nMary, you wrote: >>Does anyone have a way of cleaning their face without making their skin scream with itch?<<\nYes, I do: use aqueous cream pretending it's a liquid soap. My eczematous skin bits love it!\nDate: 16 Jul 1997 From: Judith Subject: Diabetes\nI was wondering if any of you were diabetic. I have just recently (within the past month) been diagnosed as being diabetic. In this same time frame, my eczema has gotten extremely bad. The main concern here is that diabetics are slow to heal, so any time the eczema opens the skin or I scratch it open, it takes forever to heal and I must take antibiotics to avoid infection.\nThis has been a vicious circle for me because prednisone, while it controls the eczema, ALSO kicks up the blood sugar. On my internist's advice, I have gotten completely off prednisone and am really watching the other steroids. What it boils down to, I guess, is that I can have really bad eczema and no high blood sugar, or be clear and have dangerously high blood sugar. What a choice!\nIncidentally, he also told me that that theory of undigested food was pure nonsense. Undigested food gets passed, and if your food was not properly digesting, you would be losing weight like crazy.\nDate: 16 Jul 1997 From: Angela Subject: Golden Seal Tea\nI found an Internet site that suggested use of compresses soaked in Golden Seal Tea. Anyone ever heard of this/tried it? BTW it seems that a big part of Jordan's eczema is stress related. (I know you're thinking, how much stress could a 3 year old have?). Amazingly she has a lot. If she gets mad or frustrated you can just watch her trouble spots redden up. Someone let me know about the Golden Seal Tea.\nDate: 16 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: Healing through cleansing\nI'm really pleased to report that my flare up of eczema has passed and my skin's looking (and feeling) really healthy. My hands are still a bit dodgy but as my job forces me to endure dusty books and surfaces a lot I suppose that's not surprising. My back's also got the odd spot on it but it's going... slowly...\nI think it's because I've been watching my diet carefully - lots of organic rice, fresh fruit and vegetables and tons of water... The supplements I'm taking are as I said before - 3g of evening primrose oil, milk thistle capsules, linseed, aloe vera juice and an antioxidant daily. Basically I've cut down (I wish I could say cut out - but it's not that easy!!) on all the pre-packaged food, alcohol, crisps and chocolate I love so much so I haven't got so many toxins clogging up the system. Unfortunately I do have dry areas where the eczema was but I think they should clear up in time with large amounts of moisturiser! I've just got to be careful that I don't slip into a false sense of security by returning to my old habits of overindulgence. Basically all eczema sufferers want to do is be normal but unfortunately you can't be too careful... .\nDate: 16 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: aqueous cream/sunblock\nMallika, thanks for the opticrom info. With regards to sunscreen, my derm suggested PreSun 30 Gel (not the lotion). I have used it and it does not irritate my skin. Lately, I haven't been using it because I hear that sunlight is supposed to be good for eczmatic skin, and anyways, I'm dark-skinned. Actually, some mornings, I sit out in the sun (my neighbours must think I'm courting skin cancer) with the hope that it will help... but it doesn't seem to make such a big difference. I wonder if it's because the humid air does more damage than the sun does good. Also, I have been trying out the Aveeno anti-itch, and it does help.\nDate: 16 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: contact lenses and long hair\nDoes any of you wear contact lenses, and does it irritate your eyes? The eye doctor said I should use them instead of glasses. I'm considering getting them, but I know I have a tendency to rub my eyes, and I wonder if it's such a good idea after all.\nAlso, does anyone find that their hair bothers their skin? I have long hair which I always have to keep tied back because it tends to aggravate my skin. It seems funny that I should be allergic to my own hair, I wonder if it's the shampoo I use, which has a very faint perfume that I can smell only while washing my hair. Also, I wonder if having long hair means catching more dust, pollens, etc.\nDate: 16 Jul 1997 From: Elaine Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nI hate this weather sooooo much. I like your exotic vacation idea. The on line cream feels good, but alas, (big surprize) flakes are back, they're just softer!\nRe eye problems - I developed \"herpes eczemetis\" about 7 years ago. It's pretty gross - combo of herpes blisters and eczema on my eyelids and sometimes in my eye. To keep it under control, I take Valtrex everyday. As long as I do that, I'm fine with the herpes part (no relation to genital, by the way). If I feel an outbreak coming on (lots of sun or stress) I load up on the Valtrex. It can't hurt.\nIf there was a way I could make myself take only cool showers, my skin would be 90% better. I need to join HWA. (Hot Water Anonymous)\nDate: 16 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: dead peely skin/Washing?\nI really don't wash. It is more like a very long long gentle rinse with NO SOAP of any kind. Swishing the washcloth at least 10 times over the soaked flaking areas, will remove the gross stuff without irritating the skin.\nI keep reading about doctors who recommend little or no water on the skin I tried it and it is not for me. I think the no-water-method is ill conceived out of the idea that flaking skin is dry skin and that water removes the oils from the skin. It does. But cool to cold water removes the least amount of oils\nSkin is flaking because it is irritated, just as the sun causes irritation, sunburn and flaking. Any irritant of the skin will cause flaking. That is not a dry skin problem. Although some people must have dry skin as a problem, I do not think it is an underlying cause of eczema. It is a symptom or result of eczema.\nThe important thing is to give the water time to really loosen up the skin, and then gently remove only the loosest layers of the flaking skin with very gentle swishing of washcloth. Let the water do the work, not the friction. Trying to get all of the flakes off will make things worse. The rubbing will cause irritation which will cause itching. There will always be some flakes left. If you get it \"All off\" there has been too much scrubbing which irritates more and causes more flaking. Vicious circle. Ice will slow down the itching fast if the skin does itch. The remaining flakes can be slicked down with whatever moisturizer works for you and those remaining flakes can be chased away some more during the next \"Treatment.\" But the moisturizer might be a culprit too. Try changing the moisturizer and see if it makes any difference. The less the number of ingredients the better.\nAnd as I mentioned before, if the flakes do get noticeable during the day, they can be shaved off with an electric razor (I like the rotary Norelco. Others do not help in this situation) and/or remoisturized with water and some Vaseline or something. Bathroom breaks. Someone mentioned using a non-irritating tape to remove the flakes. Maybe that will work. I also saw an advertisement for a hair removal product that is supposed to be non-irritating. \"Alexandria's Sugaring\" or something like that. It looks like a gel, that is spread on the skin, covered by a sheet of something, let alone to set for a few minutes and then SNATCHED off quickly. It yanks out the hair. I think it could be tried on a hidden part of the body for a while to see if it works without irritating. Of course hairy guys who want to be hairy guys might have a problem remaining hairy but...\nThe MAIN THING THOUGH IS TO DISCOVER AND AVOID THE ALLERGENS.\nDate: 16 Jul 1997 From: Patsy Subject: contact lenses and long hair\nMary, I wear contacts and have for a very long time. My eczema is nowhere close to my eyes, so I'm not certain I'd be much help to you on that score. But believe this - if you're wearing contacts, you WON'T be rubbing your eyes!!\nDate: 17 Jul 1997 From: Steve Subject: Let's move!!\nOK guys, I've decided I have gotta find my own little Utopia. It must have the following qualities:\nFree from dust mites\nNo hairy cats and dogs - sorry pet lovers.\nA stable climate.\nNo pollutants - that includes cars!\nAll products free from chemicals.\nA relatively stress free environment - that means the dollar/pound do not rule our lives.\nI know I know I'm dreaming again. Seriously though, if I get rid of ALL of the above I believe my eczema will go away.\nOf course if anyone is lucky enough to live anywhere resembling the above PLEASE CONTACT ME. In the meantime I'm gonna contact NASA and try and hitch a lift on the next Pathfinder mission to MARS :-) :-)\nDate: 17 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: contact lenses and long hair\nI wear high water content soft lenses which I find ok. They're supposed to be best for people with allergies.\nI've got long hair and a bit of a fringe. I find that if my fringe gets too long it interfers with my lenses and then makes my eyes itchy and then... well I'm sure you know the story. If I use anything remotely perfumed as a shampoo it irritates my face, neck and back, so I steer well clear of anything that's perfumed. I use Nutralia which I find doesn't irritate at all and - compared to a lot of those heavy anti dandruff/allergy type shampoos - makes my hair feel fresh and clean without being weighted down.\nDate: 17 Jul 1997 From: Nancy Subject: accolate\nI have not read any discussions on the use of Accolate, an asthma medication. My husband was put on it by his derm in mid-march and felt immediate relief from severe eczema. He was \"the first one in the world\" to be put on this and will be written up in the NYU medical journal shortly. Check with your derms about Accolate.\nDate: 17 Jul 1997 From: Heather Subject: long hair\nHere's my theory about eczema and \"tickly things\". This is strictly my own experience: since the worst eczema flare almost 2 years ago, my skin has become *very sensitive*. Not necessarily to allergies, but to pressure, rubbing and tickling. If I'm wearing a backpack that bounces against my back as I walk, or a tight bra, or if I nuzzle my perpetually shedding but adorable cat, this stimulation to my skin is too much. While other humans who don't suffer from eczema might be able to casually scratch at the itchy area, I can't scratch once without scratching again (and again and again). Then the spot becomes irritated and eczematous. This is not to say that I don't have spontaneous irritated spots, which are the hallmark of the disease; I just know that I can easily develop other eczema spots by overstimulating my skin.\nSo, back to hair: my guess is that you'll feel better if you keep your hair tied back, piled up or cut short. I know that stray hairs make me itch, and my partner does pick them off me (what a nice guy!) when he puts lotion on my back.\nDate: 17 Jul 1997 From: Rachel Subject: BAD DERM\nI'm back from vacation and feeling fan-friggin-tastic. My skin is in good shape-not perfect, but very good. It took a while, as it alsways does, to get better. I was able to get in the ocean without stinging on the very first day!!!\nAnyway, I didn't get to thank those of you who responded to my posting about my evil dermotologist and her lecturing tirade. I just wanted you to see the letter I wrote her. There's nothing like a little venting to clear the mind. Your support was very much needed and appreciated. Thanks would probably be an understatement.\nJune 17, 1997\nDear Dr. L, I am writing in response to our meeting today. It was upsetting and disappointing. I was puzzled by your antagonism. What may have been a genuine concern for the well being of one of your patients, came across as the judgement of my character and overall outrage against my choice to remain without insurance. To call me irresponsible and essentially thoughtless in my actions was insulting.\nDespite my not renting a small room in your office, I do take care of myself. Actually, the care starts as soon as I wake up in the morning and ends only when I shut my eyes and sleep at night. I only have one small cup of coffee, I avoid chocolate, berries, eggs, I wear only cotton, use Dreft for washing clothes, Softsoap or no soap when bathing, put cream on at least three times daily, avoid the sun, avoid sweating too much when exercising, deal with stress, etc.\nI also joined an eczema support group on the Internet, which mails postings every morning. The people on this mailing list talk about what is ailing them, suggest remedies, and offer good advice and support. It has been a tremendous help to me. I have learned things from these people that were never offered to me at the dermatologist's office.\nWhy did I experiment with the Chinese herbal tea remedies? I was in California with no doctors at my disposal, and yes, I was concerned about my allergic reaction to the sulfa medication I was taking for a urinary tract infection. So, I was willing to give it a go. As nothing from the dermatologist has ever truly cured me, I feel obligated to keep an open mind even if it means practicing a little blind faith. I like to think I am cautious, but admittedly under these circumstances I acted out of desperation. So, sue me.\nI have called you twice in the past three months to ask you about my skin, with inquiries such as, should I be concerned, do you think I should come in, can you give me an idea what's going on, etc. You were too busy to even bother to take the time to talk to me on the phone. Quite frankly, I was completely turned off by this sudden coldness on your part. Where had the doctor-patient relationship gone? Where was the Dr. L to whom I referred two new patients?\nTo blame me for my financial difficulties is unfair. If I have a hard enough time coming up with $85.00 to see you for roughly fifteen minutes, what makes you think I can chalk up $240.00 without even a flinch? Obviously, it's unwise to be without insurance. This is not a new discovery. Your superficial aspersions did nothing to shed light on my skin problem. Rather, your hostile and accusatory tone left me feeling like I'd been hit hard below the belt, and consequently defenseless. Both during my visit and immediately after, I was brought to tears. I was shaken by your attack, and my skin responded as it normally does when anxiety overwhelms me. If your cruel attack was meant more as a means to invoke a response, fine. Those tactics aren't working for me and make me feel less inclined to see you in the future.\nI came to you in need of help, and I got an uninspiring lecture about what wrong I was doing. You seemed more interested in telling me how bad I was for not having insurance then in figuring out the scientific cause for my severe allergic reaction. If you were angry with me for taking so long to pay my balance, fine. But leave that for discussion after my physical examination and diagnosis. At this point, I can only express regret that you let me down. I thank you for your treatment over the past and wish you well. I will start looking for a dermatologist who can work with me, not against me.\nDate: 17 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: Diabetes & Eczema\nThere is a cool web page you might want to check out. Some guy who wrote a book called \"Flakes\" who has psoriasis and diabetes, and writes about it with a humorous perspective. It's at http://www.beachassociates.com/flake/start.htm.\nI got to it by following links from a page recommended to us by someone else on this list, about dermatology in the cinema (very interesting!). The original page with all the links was at http://itsa.ucsf.edu/~vcr/Links.html. When I have time, I plan to pursue some of the other links as well.\nDate: 17 Jul 1997 From: Sheila Subject: Skin darkening/discoloration\nHi Sarah, Thanks a lot for your tip. I haven't tried wheatgerm oil. Now I am trying I will let you know if it reduces the effects of cortisone. I sincerely hope it does. If any of you know any more details on how to reduce the effects of cortisone please let me know.\nDate: 17 Jul 1997 From: Greg Subject: Neoral\nI have been a long time eczema sufferer. I have had it in varying degrees since 6 months of age, ranging from the traditional infantile eczema problems to the youth problems of eczema mainly in the joints and being tarred and my hands, knees and ankles tied with bed sheet strips to try and prevent me from getting at the eczema in the night. During my later schooling years, the eczema seemed to subside and only flare up now and then, primarily on my hands. However, about 15 years ago, the eczema came back in storm, with it being on my back and stomach as well as hands and arms, and then to my face. I tried to control with various salves with little luck.\nAbout 10 years ago, I gave in to cortisone shots. This cleared up the eczema, just about completely, but it would then return in a few months. I received the shots about every four months and this lasted for about 3-4 years. I started to get worse earlier and earlier following the shots. About 4 years ago, after getting the eczema back in full force about 2 months after the cortisone shot, I began a search for alternative -- and ended up trying Acupuncture -- and it worked !! I had acupuncture administered 1-2 times a week for about 4 weeks and then weekly for another 3-4 weeks, and the eczema was gone -- at least from my back and my stomach; and it was much better on my hands and arms.\nThe one trouble spot that remained was my face. I am still free of eczema on my back and stomach, my hands and arms are fair (although I now have more on the palms of my hand than I ever had before) -- but my face remains a major problem. About 15 months ago I got an infection on my face that I could not get rid of. I tried various salves and whatevers that my dermatologist had, went to an infecteous disease specialist, both to no avail. I decided to try a dermatologist that I used to go to until the trips just to get cortisone shots seemed excessive. He had me do a blood test to see if I was ok to try an experimental oral capsule that was designed to be used by those having organ transplants, but that sonehow, had gotten into the dermatology field. The product is called NEORAL and is both strong and expensive (about $6 a pill). I took the pill for a few days and the facial infection was gone -- as well as most of the eczema.\nI was desparate and found a cure -- But, insert in package contains the warnings about its use and physician management. I now have the facial eczema back again and am tring to control it thru Westcort cream and other salves.\nDate: 17 Jul 1997 From: Suzannah Subject: weddings\nThanks again to all who replied to my 'should I just go for it' e-mail. I have written to my hotel and asked my caterer to provide allergy free meals. But, yet, at the same time I am taking my steroids - only cortico (and I'm afraid, using them in advance to be looking my best) and I am going to eat meals with cheese, tomatoes etc, etc, etc if necessary, without worrying. I see this as the middle path.\nWhen I get home again I'm going on a strict diet and to see a homeopath - it seems crazy that I can't eat these foods and I am sure that it must be an imbalance of some kind. I do find that dietary restrictions make me obsessed with food, but normal moderate eating leads to no obsessing.\nOne more thing - I do not have whole body eczema, and I do feel immensely for those who do, but the 'little patches' of bad as can be eczema are really bad too, especially big oozy scabs all around the mouth, with read raw skin and being completely unable to eat, kiss or smile without cracking, itching and weeping some more. Please do not underestimate the physical or emotional effects of this 'minor' degree of affliction. I want to point this out without detracting from the worse degrees that others suffer, but it IS the same 'condition'.\nDate: 17 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: Skin darkening will disappear.\nThe darkening will go away by itself, my dermatologist and doctor say. The skin just needs time to heal and regenerate.\nDate: 17 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: weddings/feasting/JOY/suffering\nSuzannah, I took your approach many times. \"A little steroid and a little \"lapse\" in keeping my diet, and it will be ok, for now,\" I thought. That really messed me up. There always seemed to be an important event coming up that justified more steroid and more lapsing.\nPlease. Your body does not philosophize about a \"... middle path\". All your body knows is good or bad. You health is either getting better or worse. A choice to eat allergens is destructive. It will make your body worse. Avoid ruining your body. Avoid feasting on poison. Enjoy health.\nLife comes with much suffering we cannot avoid. Why CHOOSE more suffering? Food allergens will not provide joy at your wedding. Love will.\nTell the caterer *EXACTLY* exactly what you want for YOU. If the caterer cannot provide it, get someone else. Have lots of your allergy free healthy food at each meal and stay ON your healthy diet. With health and love, the world is yours. Without health, how well can we express and accept love?\nDate: 17 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: [Fwd: Re: peely skin]\nLicorice root (which Kelly tells me serves as an antihistamine by helping the adrenals) and Red Clover (nervine relaxant) can both come in pill form at health food stores. You can also brew a tea out of licorice root which can come as the root itself or ina bag of chipped root. I use both inthe pill form.\nI will try out what you suggested. I know that rinsing my face and then massaging it with mosturizers helps to hide the peeliness, but only temporarily.\nI know that finding the allergen is the key, but it's a mind boggling thing, and has caused me a lot of disappointment, frustration and stress( all of which aggravate my e), to the point where I have given up. In the past, I have had almost every type of allergy testing, but avoiding all sorts of food did not help one bit. I now think that my eczema is caused by something in the environment that I yet can't pinpoint. How did you discover your allergens?\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Samantha Subject: Everchanging weather\nHere we have two seasons. Wet season and Dry season (both hot). I have found that this is the best climate for me - it is not horrible and changing and the temperature range is small (rarely cooler than 20 degrees, rarely warmer than 33 degrees). It is great. When I lived down south with changing weather I hated the changing temperatures and my skin did too.\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Janice Subject: herpes, kids\nTO: Elaine Can you tell me more about the \"herpes eczemetis\" you mentioned, or suggest where I can get more information about this? My three-year-old daughter has eczema in various places at all times... the eczema on her hands looks very different and though I have read about \"hand eczema,\" I also have wondered for a while if it might not have some kind of herpes infection mixed in.\nTO: Angela and others with \"e\" kids: Just want to support Angela's thoughts about \"e\" kids and stress, esp. the toddlers ages. I've probably said this before, but my daughter, (3) flares during stressful times... not so much tantrum-type stress; more when the stress is recurring or on-going, like when we did a major bedtime routine change and there was stress every night for two weeks. She starts pre-school in Sept. and I'm interested to both watch her skin during this transition and to help her have a calm life during that time period so maybe her skin won't go crazy...\nWe also seem to be having good luck with lots of baths and pool swimming, after a long time of following the \"stay away from water\" gospel. Summer means playing outside and getting very dirty and needing a bath. A new neighborhood YMCA means swimming in a chlorinated pool, which I was worried about. More baths and swimming at least haven't made things \"worse\"... . I'll need more time to determine if it is \"better\" . I have also been following the great advice of not drying her off and slathering on lotion (Cetaphil Creme) before she is dry.\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: Lanolin\nI was wondering whether anyone knew about the difference between normal lanolin and hypo-allergenic lanolin? I'm a bit wary of using the hypo-allergenic stuff as I know I'm allergic to the normal product. However I lanolin is an excellent moisturiser so has anyone with a similar allergy to it used the hypo-allergenic formula with positive results??\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Karen Subject: Contact lenses\nWhat about the daily wear disposables? I'm not the one with eczema in my family, but I had problems wearing the regular contacts (eye allergies) but can wear the daily disposables quite well, and they cost about the same.\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: liver flushing/cleaning\n>> I have noticed that my eyes are a little on the beige side, instead of white. Someone mentioned that is a sign of liver problems. <<\nIt is sign but may also be associated with something else.\n>> Do other people with e have beige eyeballs? <<\nNot me.\n>> Now, if our immune systems are hyper, wouldn't they kill bacteria, fungi and parasites one their own?<<\nThere are different facets to our immune systems, our immune systems are messed up (confused), it's rather unpredictable.\n>> do you know if it is true that our immune systems are over-working?<<\nPeople mention both that during a breakout that they either have no other illnesses or catch everything and somewhere in between. I think it all depends on how weakened the immune system is at the time. It definitely is working overtime during an outbreak (or about anytime in our case) but I think it depends if it's exhausted yet, it does have it's limits.\n>> I'm just trying to understand why we have eczema.<<\nI know for a fact that we with eczema have abnormally high staph counts, even in our skin that has never been effected by eczema, this is the reason why I use the Pau d'arco. Now, I don't know why our counts are so high but that they are and we need to keep it in check.\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: Neoral\nCyclosporine: Neoral, Sandimmune\nDescription: Cyclosporine is an oral and parenteral immunosuppressive agent. It is one of several polypeptide antibiotics produced by certain fungi. Cyclosporine is used primarily as an immunosuppressive agent to prevent allograft rejection, but it also has been administered in various other autoimmune conditions such as uveitis, psoriasis, type I diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain nephropathies. The use of cyclosporine for these conditions is still under investigation. Cyclosporine was originally approved by the FDA in 1983. The patent for Sandimmune expired in September 1995. A new, microemulsion oral formulation was recommended for approval March 31, 1995 and the FDA accepted this recommendation in July 1995. On February 4, 1997, an advisory committee recommended that the microemulsion oral formulation be approved for the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis.\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: fixing up your insides\nIt is well documented in the medical community, that we with eczema do not digest fats or proteins properly or completely. This is definitely part of the makeup of our disease, it's a given.\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: fixing up your insides\nKelly, If this is so, does this mean that eczema sufferers tend to store more of their fat intake than non-sufferers - or is it just discarded from the body as waste?? The reason I ask is that I guess it could have other implications such as the build-up of fat deposits in blood vessels etc.\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: Adrenal Insufficiency/Kelly (More)\n>> Regarding raw adrenal glandulars, do you know a reliable source and how much to take?<<\nNatra-Bio, dosages go by what you feel is working for you and this will change at different stages but I wouldn't exceeded the maximum dosage without supervision when it comes to glandulars.\n>> Are there any \"vegetarian\" glands?<<\nI would doubt this.\n>> They considered that on 10 mg. a day of prednisone, they probably did not shut down completely in the first place.<<\nAgreed.\n>> You ask if my adrenals actually hurt, and imply that is a good thing. What do hurting adrenals feel like?<<\nOh that definitely varies. An ache, more than a dull one and sharp pains but not shooting. The pain tends to be in the middle ranges of pain.\n>> And why would that be a good sign? (Does it mean they're not dead?)<<\nBingo!\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 UT From: David Subject: staph counts\nThe thing about high staph counts rings true for me as I am still battling a recurring folliculitis (infection of the hair follicle) on my arms and thighs. This is a staph infection according to my derm. Could it have to do with a lack of good bacteria in our digestive systems? I've heard a lot about that lately.\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: replies\n>> Could it have to do with a lack of good bacteria in our digestive systems?<<\nThis is a possibility and by adding probiotics (good bacteria) you will bring the bacteria (good & bad) back into balance. When you battle infections, your bad bacteria is dominant and antibiotics are not the solution.\n>> If this is so, does this mean that eczema sufferers tend to store more of their fat intake than non-sufferers - or is it just discarded from the body as waste??<<\nI know the body eventually rids itself of the undigested protein but I do not know about fat.\n>> The reason I ask is that I guess it could have other implications such as the build-up of fat deposits in blood vessels etc.<<\nNow because you posed the original question I'm curious, I'll let you know what I find out.\n>> I compared flaxseed oil, evening primrose, and borage oil and they basically contain about the same.<<\nNot really, all 3 contain GLA [Gamma Linoleic Acid] but flaxseed contains so little, it's usually not considered one of it's components, flaxseed is known for it's EPA [Eicosapentaenoic Acid]. Evening Primrose Oil averages 7% GLA while Borage Oil averages 22%, a big difference since this is why we take it.\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 UT From: David Subject: Eczema and MS\nMy dad suffered from eczema as a child and young adult. He no longer has eczema but around the age of 45 he was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, which is quite severe. MS is a serious auto-immune disease where the body seems to attack itself.\nDoes anyone out there know of any link between MS and Eczema or does anyone know of someone who has suffered from both?\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: digestion\n>> So why don't dermatologists mention this?<<\nI always marked it up to lack of interest or overwhelmed by the complexity of the disease. To me, this never mattered much due to I realized early on how the medical community operates due to their training and it's not all their fault, they're trained to treat a symptom not fix a cause and we as individuals are responsible for our own health, if anyone is depending on a doc to save them, their depending on the wrong person.\nAll illness is internal, if you're given a fungal medication to get rid of a fungus, you're only treating a symptom, you need to address what went wrong internally that allowed the fungi to grow.\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: Suzannah/Cortisone/Mouth Eczema\nAbout eczema around the mouth: I do have full body eczema but find that the mouth scabs are the worst part because they are so painful as well as unsightly. So don't think you're overreacting!\nAlso, I think your mental health and happiness are very important (and can even influence your skin). Since this will be your Big Day, a little cortisone and a little \"lapsed eating\" may help you enjoy it fully. Howard suggested that it may be too easy for some of us to fall into the habit of thinking that *every* event is so special as to warrant a little cortisone. But you sound like you're determined to get back to healthy living when you get home. And after all, how often does one get married? (though it may be several times, nowadays!)\nHave fun and may you go down the aisle scratch-free.\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: Eczema and MS\nEczema attacks the skin and MS attacks myelin sheath. MS is caused by a virus and I'm not so sure that eczema isn't either, if you take Thuja which is strictly antiviral your eczema improves.\nThis is not a new area for me but also not well investigated due to I marked it partly up to a possible virus connection. My mother got MS in her mid to late twenties, she has the slow progression type, and if you notice, both MS and eczema tend to have the same types of treatments, one being GLA. Eczema ran very mildly in her family but my father is the one with respiratory allergies.\nJust a note... Children of MS parents do not usually contract the disease due to we build up antibodies to it young, it's like being vaccinated.\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: Judith Subject: Aveeno anti itch cream\nThank you, thank you, THANK YOU to whoever it was that suggested the Aveeno anti itch cream! I got some yesterday (was amazed that it was so inexpensive- $3.69) and had my first itchless night in several weeks - not since my last celestone shot! My calves and shins have been particularly bad lately with thickening, blistering and weeping and not only did the Aveeno stop the itch, but it dried up the oozing. And the skin around it actually seemed soft and moist. I also found that it comes as a lotion (about twice the price), but I went with the cream. (Was all the money I had on me at the time I found it.)\nAlso, thanks for the referral to the \"Flakes\" web page, but I read the whole thing through and could not find anywhere that he said he was diabetic. He also mentioned Skin-Cap, so they (the Skin-Cap people) have evidentally made inroads to the Psoriasis people as well. I was going to write to him about it,but he does not seemed too concerned about steroids. In fact, he says he PLANS his steroid use to coincide with times he must make a psoriasis free appearance. His only objection to the Skin-Cap was the cost.\nDate: 18 Jul 1997 From: John Subject: BAD DERM\nHi, Rachel: Loved your \"BAD DERM\" letter. I'm sure that all of us would also like to hear the reply - if any! BTW, I think my last derm went to the same school as yours.\nDate: 19 Jul 1997 From: Yolande Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nI used to wear soft disposable contact lenses (disposed fortnightly). When fresh, they felt wonderful, but as the day(s) wore on, my right lens would get very dry and irritated, and move about in my eye or stick to the lids. I don't know if this is due to having eczema or not, but it probably is as my right eyelid is often itchy and so is the eye sometimes. Also, they became a hassle as after a hard day's work, I found it bothersome to have to clean and disinfect them. So I've gone happily back to glasses and only wear the lenses on SPECIAL occasions when I want to be 'vain'. (If that is at all possible for an eczema sufferer!) I then dispose of them immediately instead of keeping them.\nMy hair, which is short, sometimes bothers my face when the eczema is acting up there. I tie it back every night. It may be the shampoo that you use that is bothering you. Does anybody know what sort of shampoos are good for us?\nDate: 20 Jul 1997 From: Nelson Subject: Dr. John Pagano's Healing Psoriasis Book\nI have been reading the book, Healing Psoriasis, by Dr. John O.A. Pagano. Basically, he believes that Psoriasis and Eczema is caused by toxins that are escaping into the blood from the intestinal tract. These toxins over-work the liver and kidneys and eventually pollute our skin. Dr. Pagano believes that if we cleanse our body of these toxins, our skin problems will disappear. He writes of different cleansing treatments in his book. Any thoughts?\nHis treatments consist of internal cleansing with high colonic irrigation, home enemas, natural cathartics (foods that motivate evacuation of the bowel), proper diet (alkeline foods, vitamins, and herbs) .\nHas anyone tried this? Are there any opinions?\nDate: 19 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: Neoral\nThe main place to get drug info from is http://www.cponline.gsm.com/. Usually what I put on the list is quick info but this site does give extensive info. They have a member's area that is quite nice but you need not subscribe to get the drug info, the member's area is more in-depth.\nDate: 19 Jul 1997 From: Elaine Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nJanice - I'm not sure what I can tell you but I'll tell you what I know re herpes eczemetis. The first time I came down with it was about 10 years ago. I had a regular eczema patch on my neck, which then developed into little blisters that seem to multiply daily. It didn't look like regular old eczema but I always think everything looks like eczema! It then spread to my eyelids, since I had small cracks and eczema there too. I started taking prednisone and all the usual stuff, but it wasn't getting better. Then I noticed some blisters on my eyelids and inside my eyelids and got scared.\nMy doctor took a culture and came back a few minutes later and said it was the most pronounced case of herpes eczemetis he had ever seen. He even brought in the interns to see. Great. Anyway, I had to be admitted because herpes in the eye is not good. I was on an IV drip on acyclovir (sp) for a few days. He told me the herpes is a virus that will always be with me and that I should watch for the signs carefully to nip it in the bud with valtrez (actually it was acyclovir then - the valtrex is a newer drug) at the first signs. Sometimes it's hard to tell what is herpes vs regular eczema but the herpes always starts on my eyelids . It spreads very quickly so that if I have a blister on my eyelid I will soon have one on the upper part of my eyelid - where the two touch when I blink, if that makes any sense.\nI'd suggest asking your derm to do a culture. Prednisone will make herpes worse - so don't take it if you think it is herpes.\nDate: 19 Jul 1997 From: Patsy Subject: Dr. John Pagano's Healing Psoriasis Book\nWhile I have no quarrel with \"alkeline\" foods, vitamins, and herbs, the rest of what this doctor Pagano is suggesting sounds dangerous. Other opinions?\nDate: 19 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: acupunture\nI too tried acupuncture a few years ago, and unfortunately, I don't think it helped me at all. A year and a half ago, I was also given a steroid injection which kept me clear for almost a whole (happy and exquisite!!!) year. When my eczema came back, my derm offered to give me another one, but I decided to wait, and use it only if my eczema got so bad I was driven to despair.\nBut since being with this group, I have decided not to ever have another steroid shot, and your info on how each shot lasts for a shorter and shorter period has strengthened this resolve. There are other ways to control our eczema - we just have to find what works for us.\nDate: 19 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: Kelly's herbs\nThanks Kelly for your answers to my many questions; they're very helpful. Just to let you know, I've been using the red clover and the licorce root, and they are helping to keep my eczema in control. (It's such a good feeling to know you have some control over your eczema)\nI still use elocom, but have been tapering to the point of using it once every three days. Today is a milestone for me, because I have been relatively clear for two whole entire happy weeks- still some peely skin, but not red and perpetually itchy, and my skin is not burning hot- in fact it's nice and cool at times.\nI'm going to get some of that Pau D'arco and chase those staphs out of my system. I'm also considering trying some milk thistle as well. I wonder why the naturopath I went to a few years ago never told me about these herbs...\nDate: 19 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: Karen/Roben/Tests\nIT IS A MATTER OF DEGREE as the allergist says. BUT... . If several of your allergies are mild you might not know that you are having allergic symptoms at all, but you should be aware that they can be manifested in practically any way. I wish I had the list here, but symptoms can range from headache, blurry vision, hearing/congested ears, breathing problem/asthma, bad breath, muscle ache, stomach ache, skin problems, misco-ordination, reduced mental acuity, joint ache, difficulty in urination, and on and on. Allergies can affect every part of your body.\nThe effects of so called MILD ALLEGIES, if not detected and stopped by eliminating exposure to the allergens, can build up. I would not ignore those items on the testing results that seem to be minor until you are sure that they are not a problem. Until you repeatedly try exposure to them in a controlled fashion you cannot be sure. The tests are only a beginning of the discovery experience. Finding the offending allergens may be a painstaking process which requires change of habits, changing environments, food elimination trials, diets. It may take many months, depending upon the degree of use of a scientific approach. Ease and joy will be the results when the exposure to the allergens are eliminated. Putting this off will extend any suffering. There is no easy way out . yet\nDate: 20 Jul 1997 From: Sherry Subject: BAD DERM\nDear Rachel, What a great letter - Bad Derm. I think you said what all of us have been thinking about many of our derms for years.You are also a very skilled writer. Hats off to you!\nDate: 20 Jul 1997 From: Steve Subject: Everchanging weather\nHi Sam, I am seriously thinking of moving to a steadier climate but I have become very sensistive to the sun. You say that it is always hot where you live and that this suits you best. Do you have any problems with the heat and the sun? Or did your body adjust accordingly?\nI used to always improve in the summer because of the sun. Now my skin erupts when it is exposed to the sun for more than five minutes. Before I make the decision to move I need to know if this can be reversed over time.\nDate: 20 Jul 1997 From: Elaine Subject: Prozac & Eczema\nHas anyone who is on Prozac (and I know that's gotta be lots of us - who wouldn't get depressed over this hell???!!) ... noticed increased sweatiness as a side effect? Any other meds that aggravate the condition for anyone?\nDate: 20 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: Elaine/Howard/DoxepinLessItching/Prozac/Eczema/\nAsk your doctor about the antidepressant Doxepin. It was prescribed for reducing itching. It works. I take it about 5pm or earlier, depending on my bedtime. I take it about 2-3 hours before bedtime, or anytime I'm itchy and/or depressed. One of doctors said it gives you a boost. That might be true, depending on the dose. He suggested a maintenance dose of 10 mg a day at bedtime or 30 when you are itchy.\nAs far as any other meds that aggravate eczema, I could give you a list of antibiotics that bother me, but they might not bother you. Sulpha too.\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Samantha Subject: Everchanging weather\nI am still a itchy in extreme heat (in the wet season when it is excrutiatingly humid) when the sweat is rolling from every pore in my body, but heat is easier for me because I don't have to breathe in dust from bedclothes and carpets and curtains. We leave our doors and windows open all year round here - always fresh air flowing through the place. We do not have to sleep under tons of dusty stinky doonas and blankets - we like to sleep buff up here ;-).\nI tend to be more itchy in cold, dry weather - I think it is because of the amount of clothing one has to wear and the drying heating and stuffy smelly closed up houses. When I go in the sun in cold, dry climates I get a prickly, itchy sensation (btw I also get this sensation from fluro lighting).\nI don't go in the sun very much here - it strikes people as strange but very few people up here in the tropics have tans - it is becasue it is simply too hot to go in the sun.\nWhen I holiday in the summer I am at the beach all day and in the sun I don't have a problem but being on holidays and swimming in salt water most likely helps on that front.\nThe main reason I live here is because of the warm weather - I live thousands of kilometers from my family but I cannot cope with winter. I have had to make a hard choice to live away from them for the sake of my skin. I miss them terribly and I have missed out on seeing my my sisters get married, my nieces and nephew grow up and other family things. But I cannot live where I cannot have warmth and I cannot live where I have to close the windows.\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Dale Subject: Prozac and St. John's Wort * coral rash that persists\nThe herb \"St John's Wort\" has received a lot of media publicity recently - ie \"20/20\". Seriously, it is claimed to improve mood and is suggested as an alternative to Prozac and other anti-depresants. I started taking it, as I felt I could use an improved mood -- I have not taken any Rx anti-depressants - only sometimes too much coffee to get revved up. In any case, I can't say I have any positive or negative reactions yet, since I ran out of my first bottle of 60 after re-reading the dose and going from 2 capsules per day to 6. I then found out there is a shortage, at least here -- both Walmarts were out and the GNC was keeping it behind the counter and limiting people to 2 bottles of 100.\nIt costs between 8-12 cents a capsule so should cost you less than a buck a day - which is cheaper than Starbucks coffee but more expensive than instant Maxwell house or NoDoz. It is certainly cheaper than a Shrink or Prozac. If it is chiefly a placebo, thats all the better - just dont get placebo side effects.\nThis is my 2-cents worth. I doubt that any anti-itch will occur, but I am anxious for others to give their experience with St. John's wort.\nOver 10 years ago I was scuba diving in Bonaire, in the Netherland's Antilles (yes be jealous - it was wonderful!) and carelessly got a coral scrape on my left shin. It gave me a problem immediately, even though I applied a papain based coral neutralizer within the hour. I had remissions for years and recurrances for a few weeks and then remission. However, about 6 months ago it came back and has stayed. I tried 1% hydrocortisine and got some temporary relief but it bounced back when I stopped.\nI saw the note about digestive enzymes and got some papaya enzymes from the health food store. I know some are Rx - any other OTC enzymes that may work?\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Dale Subject: Cleaning \"Toxic Wastes\" from your Colon, etc - bad scene\nSure your intestines resemble a toxic waste dump - that's what they were designed for. They were not designed for the highly refined, low fiber/residue diet of the Western \"civilizations\" and that an increase in fiber to decrease transit time (time between ingestion and defecation\" is desirable. Coffee (decaf or hi-test) enemas, etc. seem very unwise. They wash out the desirable as well as alleged \"toxic\" products.\nI have been using wheat bran and psyllium (generic Metamucil) for several years and it appears to keep things moving well. I have an inherited trait that grows polyps in stomach, small and large intestine (Peutz-Jaeghers Syndrome), and also take Vit C and E for their anti-oxidant properties.\nIt just seems to make the most sense to allow the body to work the way it was designed, not use a hydraulic roto-rooter to clean it out. You wouldn't flush your eyes every 10 minutes with a fire hose if your tear ducts were blocked. You would get them unblocked and let the natural tears do the eye cleansing job they were intended to do when Nature (Mother or Mother-in-Law) designed it. The same with your colon.\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Subject: medicinal marijuana for e\nThe New York Times Magazine for July 20 had an article about the medical uses of marijuana. It mentioned that the San Francisco Buyers' Club had among its customers people with psoriasis. I wonder if anyone with eczema has used marijuana for relief from itching.\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Patsy Subject: medicinal marijuana for e\nMickey, I have not used marijuana for relief from itching, but if it still itched, I bet you wouldn't care <g>!\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: medicinal marijuana for e\nThe problem is that when I smoke marijuana it tends to make my skin erupt, so although it may relieve itching at the time (I've never thought about it one way or the other in fact), it makes my skin worse for a few days after because of all the toxins - so I think as an aid to relieving eczema I think it's a bit of a dead end.\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Robert Subject: Rachel's letter to derm\nI once had an incident with a derm who really wasn't interested in hearing my input into the scenario about the flare up (condensed version of what happened). I wrote a note saying that I was not going to pay for the visit (and why that was) and that I would gladly like to have the rationale arbitrated by the AMA.\nI received one phone call and again explained what I felt was wrong with the interaction. After that, it was the end of it. I hoped my message got through but I really doubt it.\nBTW, this derm is still practicing and doing very well... I went back to her when she was covering for my derm (after not seeing her for about 15 years). She did not remember me and gave me the fix (prednisone injection).\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Heather Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nAbout 2 weeks ago I had an unusually bad flare up so I went to see my allergist. He gave me the okay to take some predisone, because the eczema was on my face. UGH! I started out on 30 ml and then decreased by 5 ml daily till about 10 mls. My skin never looked and felt better. For the first time in a while, I felt \"normal\" again. I figured that during this time my skin would heal and then when I stopped taking the predisone I would try very hard not to scratch. During this week I also only took warm showers and no HOT WATER. I was playing tennis and not scratching and it felt great.\nI stopped taking predisone the other day and the eczema is starting to come back, mostly just dry skin around my lips. it is amazing how one drug can do wonders! Everyone says that cortisone pills are bad for you, but are they really that terrible? I would like to hear from any one out there. Anyone a long term user dealing with the terrible side effects. These drugs have never done anything but help me and I never experienced any side effects at all.\nI am going to a new allergist tommorow to hear what he has to say. I have found that I look and feel the best for the first hour after I shower after I have fully creamed my entire body with all the different lotions. I wonder if increasing the cool showers and thus moisturizers might help?\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Brad Subject: Prozac & Eczema\nI used to take Prozac but didn't like it at all. It made me edgy. I'm taking a similar antidepressant called \"Paxil\". At first, Paxil would cause me to sweat. However, after awhile (like, maybe 6 weeks) that side effect disappeared. How long have you been taking Prozac? Perhaps the side effect will disappear for you too.\nAnother supplement that works *very* well to increase alertness and memory recall, as well as to enhance one's mood is Ginkgo Phytosome which is manufactured by Enzymatic Therapy. You can get a bottle of 60 softgel capsules at a health food store for about $20. I take two capsules a day between meals. I notice a BIG difference if I don't take the capsules for a couple of days. Ginko Phytosome (in addition to Paxil) has definitely improved my overall mental state.\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Nancy Subject: Dr. John Pagano's Healing Psoriasis Book\n>> His treatments consist of internal cleansing with high colonic irrigation, home enemas, natural cathartics (foods that motivate evacuation of the bowel), proper diet (alkeline foods, vitamins, and herbs).<<\nBeen there. Done that. Didn't help!\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Kim Subject: Dr. John Pagano's Healing Psoriasis Book\nI read this book and saw some things I felt were relevant. But I really did not like the way the book read. (I am great, me, me me... ) Get my meaning? I thought of that Heaven's Gate Leader. Also I thought that the treatments were to extreme for my 2 year old. But if the recomendations sound good to you go for it. I think that we all have the feeling of the right way to treat our spectific eczema if you can listen to your body. Example, Kelly is a less-is-more kind or person while Mary thinks that a restricted diet does not help at all, another person on the list does not care what is in SkinCap because it works. So follow your (not the Dr.) feeling and see how it goes.\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Bas Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nMy son (17 mths) has severe eczema all over and I've found this discussion list very very useful so thanks to everyone for the practical suggestions. I'm scared to try a lot of the alternative therapies suggested since he's so small but would be really grateful if someone with a really young child with eczema could let me know their recipes for reducing the scratching - some days I'm ready to tear my hair out!\nI find a long soak in cool water with a squirt of mineral oil or Aveeno helps him temporarily. A new allergist we're seeing recommended zyrtec even though he's so small because he put up quite a display in his office! He's sleeping much better now though he has a really tough time during the day. Does anyone know of any company that sells clothes specially for children with eczema? (100% cotton, full sleeves, feet covered) My son's favorite distraction is a CD ROM for children called My First Incredible Amazing Dictionary and it keeps him scratch free for 1/2 hr at a time.\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Patsy Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nHeather asked if cortisone was really \"that bad.\" Well, I had an orthopedist who was injecting it into my knee at one time for a non-eczema related problem call it \"liquid leukemia\".\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Keith Subject: <No subject given>\nI would like to relate my daughter's experience with eczema. She is 5 years old. It first surfaced after a visit to Disney World. Apparently the stress of traveling combined with an impetigo infection upon return was enough to launch her into a full scale eczema flareup. For those with young children Disney is loud and dark and scary on most rides. Now we know!\nAfter a dose of prednisone and a year of using cortisone cream, avoiding unecessary baths we were able to bring it back under control. Instead of every month derm visit we graduated to once every 3 months. This year she needed to have immunization shots for kindergarten and freaked out. She was a screaming meemie and kicked the nurse, etc. In other words the stress in her life was high. On top of that she had to have a umbilical hernia fixed. The two events again put her eczema into overdrive.\nI am trying the Evening Primrose oil in the morning and putting Vitamin E oil on her skin at night and trying to avoid wholesale use of the cortisone cream. I have also started giving her 3 doses a day of Zinc. There was another woman who mentioned a 3 year old under stress and it definitely does happen. I am giving my daughter backrubs in the morning because they relax her and the oil rubs at night help too.\nI don't think that food allergies play a big role for her. My son had terrible eczema on his face/body as an infant looked like an alien baby and we finally narrowed it down to a milk allergy. He drinks rice milk and his skin has been clear for the past two+ years (he'll be 4). Whereas my daughter did not show any signs of eczema prior to the stress event of Disney. I hesitate to think hers is food related. Though I have read that removing all food colorings and preservatives will take care of a lot of eczema in children. Has anyone gone to this extreme? While it may not be an allergy issue, has other behavior (i.e. tendency to be overly sensitive) changed?\nDate: 21 Jul 1997 From: Helen Subject: Kids with E and salt water\nI just discovered this weekend that Daniel, 2 1/2, has an immediate burning reaction to salt water. Fortunately, we were at a beach that had a fresh water stream flowing almost into it so I was able to wash his legs off there. But I was so surprised because the chlorine in my parents' pool doesn't seem to affect him negatively except he gets a funny reddish rash across his belly and probably more when he's in the pool--it doesn't itch or make him yell or scratch or get sores, though. In fact, if anything, the chlorine either is neutral or improves his condition.\nThe baking soda in his bath has done wonders. We teeter on the brink of breaking out but it keeps disappearing lately, thank God. Any other parents with eczema kids, or adults with eczema experience this chlorine/salt water difference in reaction?\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Brigit Subject: Dr. Pagano's book\nHi Patsy- You and I seem as usual to be of the same sort of mind... I read the book, bought it actually, and I think it has a very strong smell of quack.\nJust MY opinion, don't fall all over me <g>!\nDate: 6 Jun 1997 From: Robin Subject: cotton clothes\nBy catalog, Hanna Anderson and Biobottoms (call 800 directory for the numbers) has clothing like this - pricey, though. I buy at their sales. My favorite brand 100% cotton footed stuff is Agabang - they are sold in the real pricey stores here for $30 per outfit - but they are also sold for about $11-15 at Costco warehouse outlet, which is where I have stocked up. Good luck, many of here know what you are going through. Have you tried a humidifier? That's helped my Mollie a lot.\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Kay Subject: Leg covers!\nSurprise! EJ is sleeping at night! EJ is not scratching! (much) EJ is GAINING WEIGHT and growing hair! EJ's mommy is not sure why... but she has an idea.\nThe only things that have changed around here are: I bought six pairs of little girl's (sorry, EJ!) leotards and EJ wears them ALL THE TIME under his snap onesies (haven't figured out how to undo them, yet... give him time!) so he can't tear himself apart. We are keeping him inside out of the heat ALL THE TIME (sorry, EJ!) If we renege about that, he goes rashy all over his legs in under an hour.\nBut this combined therapy seems to be working at present. He has little interest in scratching until I diaper him (and the leos are off) and then he starts scratching like mad behind his knees. (I am now almost as quick as an Indy 500 pit crew when it comes to diaper changes!)\nHis legs look sooooo marvellous. Still not perfect, though. Eczema bumps all over, but no horrible broken leathery skin and crusty nickel-size patches anymore.\nOf course, we can't do this to him forever. Maybe he will grow out of it before he learns to shuck his leotards and wants to go out very badly with his siblings. Please, God? :-)\nWish I could abound in joy when things are tough. For now, I am abounding for joy given a wonderful cause.\nHope each one of you has a lovely day with NO itching.\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Angela Subject: Kids and e\nI have started Jordan on Evening Primrose oil. She's only been taking it for a week and I only give her one capsule a day. She has one good day and then something will set her off (this last time it was going outside to play) and she has many days of bad, but her overall skin seems so much softer. She takes Benadryl at night so she won't itch. That's when it seems the worst.\nWe keep her very moisturized so her eczema patches are red, but they don't flake very much if at all. Her panty elastic seems to cause a bad flare-up, but so far we have not found a pair that doesn't. I let her run around the house naked sometimes so nothing touches her bad spots. She really likes to do that.\nWhen I notice her scratching really bad, I sit down with her and rub her itchy spots. Obviously her fingernails are practically nonexistent. We are contemplating another trip to her derm because this last attack has been going on for a while now. I am concerned about using Cortaid on her so often because I know it thins her skin. What else can it do?\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Richard Subject: MARIJUANA & E\nI smoked pot for years and itched badly when I did it. Yes, Patsy, I didn't care (I also took a lot of prednisone to make up for it). I am allergic to grasses and pollens, so it makes sense that pot would make me itch.\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: Kelly/Thuja?\nThe problem I have with eczema is I'm not sure what the cause is and not knowing the cause, it's hard to figure out which treatment path to take and because I'm forever searching for the cause it takes me in different directions.\nThuja is a homeopathy remedy for viruses. Thuja Occidentalis 6X is recommended for eczema not 30X. There are many different routes in the treatment of eczema but this definitely is one of the more cheaper. I did it for awhile but I have a problem with taking a lot of little pills, I tend to forget to take them.\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Tina Subject: update\nJust wanted to say that Daniel has been sleeping through the night for a few weeks now. It sure feels good to get some real sleep! He wakes up about once a night and whines, but falls right back asleep. He has also been off the bottle for over a week now and doesn't seem to miss it!\nHis skin still doesn't look real good, we are avoiding all known food allergens, but it has been hot here lately and he does't do well in the car. We have been going into town and also going on little lake trips--even though we have air conditioning in the car, it is still warm in his car seat and he scratches like a maniac.\nHis skin never really gets oozy anymore just red and bumpy and then a little worse when he scratches. He has also developed deep grooves in some of his bendy places---wrists and big toes. But he seems to be happier than ever and the best thing is his sleeping at night, we even skipped his antihistimine one night and he still slept through.\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Tina Subject: Leg covers!\nKay, I just wanted to say how happy I am to hear your good news about EJ! (Just don't show him any pictures of himself in leotards when he is a teen, maybe that would be good blackmail material--ha ha.)\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: Kelly's herbs\nI've personally have had much problems taking Red Clover, it's supposed to be an excellent choice for eczema from what I've found but I have taken 3 different ones and react to them all but that's not to say it wouldn't be a good choice for others, my body just rejected it.\nMary, was your naturopath licensed? My Derm is now studying to become a Naturopath, he's like in a state of awe, the principles are so different than what he was trained on. Sounds strange but I'm actually proud of him.\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Kelly Subject: Kids and e\nI don't know any particular panty elastics for kids but I have to wear ones that the cotton covers the elastic, making sure no elastic is exposed.\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Linda Subject: Food allergies\nLast week I went to my allergist for a followup visit. I asked him about the possibility of food allergy testing, and he basically said he doesn't feel they are accurate 'cause don't have \"root\" of the food. Makes me wonder why they did all those skin-prick tests on my son then (different allergist, of course). Personally I believe the RAST test is more accurate.\nI then explained to my allergist why I was interested in food testing -- b/c of my eczema. He said that if I stay away from the following foods, I should see a big improvement within a month. So here's the list: chocolate, nuts, strawberries (any kind of berries), citrus, egg *white*, peas and beans.\nHas anyone else heard this from their derm or allergist? I already know that peanuts, chocolate are on the list of things to avoid. However, I LOVE chocolate! This will be a biggie to give up, but I think it's worth a try. Does anyone have experience with avoiding these specific foods and has it helped?\nI think I'll try it, just have to get geared up/psyched/right mindset to do it. Chocolate will definitely be the hardest -- probably go thru withdrawal.\nI continue to take Borage oil capsules and Zinc, and Multi-vitamin. I'm so tired of this skin \"problem\". It's really annoying sometimes, especially in the summer when you want to wear shorts or go swimming. I do wear shorts and don't get embarrased, but hesitate to wear a swimsuit (might scare someone!) ... a couple years ago a little boy at the lake asked me what was wrong with my legs. That's when I realized how obvious and unsightly the eczema is to others, and I've just become so accustomed to seeing my legs look that way. Pretty weird that something like eczema becomes \"normal\" to us after awhile.\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Michael Subject: Food allergies\nCarob has the same texture and smoothness of chocolate and a similar (not that close) taste. If you use it in baking (carob chip cookies) you can hardly tell the difference.\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Tina Subject: Food allergies\nWe got asked a few days ago if Daniel has the measles...\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: Is cortisone really that bad?\nHi, Heather, I used oral prednisone daily for 13 years, and never experienced any \"obvious\" bad side effects either. I thought the 2-page-long list of bad stuff in the PDR was just theoretical and didn't apply to me. After all, I ate carefully, exercised, liked my job, practiced stress reduction, consumed dairy products for my bones, and felt so much better when on prednisone that I convinced myself that it couldn't possibly be all that bad, and that only people in poor health or unlucky ones would fall prey to those side effects.\nWell, when a routine bone density scan at age 47 indicated that I already had severe osteoporosis, it was quite a shocker. I started taking some medication that is supposed to rebuild bone but (still being in denial) felt I could not stop using the prednisone.\nThe following year, when a follow-up bone density scan showed some more deterioration, despite the osteoporosis meds, I finally heard the clarion call to abandon demon prednisone. Fortunately, at about that very same time, I discovered this list and learned that (a) I wasn't the only one in the world who suffered, (b) there were a host of alternatives I hadn't yet tried (I thought I knew them all), and (c) if my skin did flare up, there were sympathetic ears I to whom I could bemoan my fate.\nI have now been off prednisone for about 4-1/2 months, and am well pleased with my decision. My eczema cleared up spontaneously for a while, but has now deteriorated again. However, the fact that it could clear up even while not taking prednisone convinced me that I *can* live without it, and I will just try to ride out the bad times using other means while waiting for another natural remission.\nIn retrospect, I am not sorry to have ever used prednisone. It certainly contributed to my well-being and quality of life at certain strategic times, like my wedding day, or on vacation trips, or when I had to give a major presentation at a conference. I *am* sorry, though, that I used it unthinkingly for 13 years. There were times I probably could have been fine without it, but I was always afraid of a flare-up if I quit. And eventually I built up a tolerance to it whereby it no longer worked at low levels and I needed to take larger doses.\nMy bottom line opinion (sorry to have gone on for so long) is that cortisone is not a horrible poison but neither is it a benign friend. It has its occasional place for very severe, debilitating outbreaks (or weddings), but should be used judiciously. I believe my osteoporosis (and any other consequences which may make themselves known down the road) were the result of the protracted, daily use, and would not have occurred with just infrequent, short-term use.\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Nancy Subject: Food allergies\nI definitely felt improvement when I gave up sweets (not just chocolate). The homeopath I saw asked me to give up dairy, wheat and red meat as well. The severity of my eczema has been fluctuating regardless of dietary restrictions, but I still do try and avoid sweets for the most part.\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Charlie Subject: From Helen\nMy daughter is almost 3. Her eczema has gotten progressively worse in the last 2 1/2 years. Numerous foods allergies and sensitivities (there is a difference) trigger her eczema. We have been down a long road of doctors and allergists who have confused us, misinformed us, have given us prescriptions for anti-histamines and cortizone treatments. Throughout this time she got worse. She is getting better now. The severe inflammation has been gone for weeks now, although her skin is still dry and flaky, Here's what we are and aren't doing.\nI'm reading a lot. Doing this has made me realize that doctors don't know as much as society gives them credit for.\nInterro food sensitivity testing. (EAV - electroacupuncture by Voll). Your allergist will tell you that it doesn't work. It measures electric tension on the skin when the technician holds a probe at acupuncture points on the a finger. Because food is a big trigger for Valerie's eczema avoiding is critical. Pin prick tests measure anti-bodys that are produced (as I'm sure you already know). Valerie is \"allergic\" to about 10 things but is \"sensitive\" to about 40.\nYour doctor will tell you that parasites only exist in 3rd world countries. Faecal tests are ineffective since they give false negatives 50% of the time. A technology called \"Darkfield Microscopy\" is awesome (your doctor will probably discredit this as well). A small pinprick is made from which a drop of blood is extracted. The \"live\" blood is placed under a microscope and you along with the technician see the blood on a video monitor. I saw with my own eyes!!! You may not have parasites, but evidently these organisms are responsible for a lot more eczema than we realize.\nHere's how we're treating her (finally!!!):\nEssential fatty acids. 1 TBLS. 2x daily (particularily flax, hemp, evening primrose)\nHigh quality multi-vitamin\nO.P.C (oligemeric proanthorcyanamim) from grape seed extracts for detoxifying and fortifying the blood.\nZinc to help the immune system and skin health. Also a mild sedative, so we give it to her each nite.\nCINA 4ch. A homeopathic pellets form for the parasites.\nUNDA #44. another homeopathic medicine to aid the kidneys in cleansing.\nUNDA #270 an ointment that soothes without suppressing the eczema WHICH IS WHAT CORIZONE DOES.\nUNDA SOLVAROME. Essential oils that soothe itchy skin.\nClean drinking water. Reverse osmosis removes the most garbage.\nOrganic fruits and veggies whenever possible\nShower filters that remove harmful chlorine (linked to cancer as well)\nEchinacea. 15 drops 2x daily for two weeks. Take two weeks off and restart.\nAcidophilus. 2x daily to help build the healthy bacteria in the gut.\nPapaya chewable enzymes to aid digestion.\nIn closing, I would like to say that orthodox medicine has left a bitter taste in my mouth. My experiences with arrogant doctors who believe that orthodox medicine is the only thing that works have prolonged my daughters' agony unnecessarily. (I hope I haven't offended anybody.) Remember to treat the problem not the symptom.\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Elaine Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nHeather, I REALLY know what you mean about prednisone being the miracle drug. I was recently on it for a few weeks after having been off of it for about 8 years. I want it back!\nThere are side effects for long term use. I developed skin sores, gained a bit of weight, was sweating more and had a flushed face most of the time. Other than that, I felt great... I too, like most of us, feel best right after a long cool shower. I bought a new shower massage head the other day (thanks to someone's suggestion here) with a detachable handle on it. The flow of water is more evenly spread than my old shower head. I also hop in the tub in the morning (I usually shower in the evenings) and do a quick rinse on my body without the hassle of taking a full blown shower. Then I cream up.\nOne other tip - fill little dixi cups withwater and put in freezer. When you wake in the middle for the night with an itch attack, use it to cool you down. Ice takes away itch like nothing else can.\nDate: 22 Jul 1997 From: Tom Subject: Danger of prednisone\nI have taken prednisone off an on for most of my life. I have asthma and eczema. Numerous allergies including food allergies. I thought I was doomed to live my life stoned because all the antihistamines at the time made us sleepy. Prednisone it seemed was the only answer. My weight went up significantly (Huge gut, round (\"moon\") face. The last 4 years or so I had to increase my doses before they would be effective. My knees began to ache, then my hips, my feet needed orthotics, I couldn't lift my arms above my head without shoulder pain. I didn't connect this with my prednisone until I noticed my vision deteriorating. An eye Dr. told me that I had cataracts growing as a direct result of steroid use.\nThen I woke up. A new antihistimine called Reactine (Zyrtec in the U.S.) came out. It was the first antihistamine I had taken that worked on the itching but didn't make me sleepy. I tried weaning myself off of prednisone over 1 month and flared right up. It took me close to 4 months to finally get off and have been off (except for 2 -1 week bursts of prenisone) for over 2 years now. I monitor my diet fairly closely avoiding milk products primarily. So far so good.\nConclusion: Woman are at something like 4-5 times the risk for osteoporosis more than men . Adding long term prednisone to that risk factor puts it up astronomically. Get off the prednisone ASAP (I know it's hard). Take 3-4 months to get off it in order to build your adrenal glands up. I wish I had better news but that's the story from someone who took too much for too long.\nDate: 23 Jul 1997 From: Kristen Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nActually, extremes of warm and cold bother me, no matter what month it is. I avoid sweating because that makes me itchy, along with high humidity--nearly the same thing as far as I can tell. Don't you guys have any pollens blowing around in all that free air? How does one avoid fluoro lighting when that's all there is in office buildings?\nRobert, Quite an innovative challenge to the dull derm! Here's another scenario about derm doc's--my regular derm referred me to the Univ here, and I got this very empathic, excellent derm (PhD, MD) who I liked very well. We were about to tailor a regimen for me when university politics yanked him out of his PT clinical practice and planted him FT over at the VA Hosp. Seems it was a political move decided by the omniscient management gurus on campus who didn't give sh-- about his patients. He wasn't given the option of saying goodbye. He wasn't given a choice either--if he wanted to work and feed his family. How I love politics!\nHeather, Couldn't resist commenting on your note about lengthy use of cortisone. You voiced what were exactly my sentiments--get relief and normalcy now and pay the piper later. I still do that, but after 35 years of topical use, primarily facial, I'm having severe problems because of highly acute sensitivity to absolutely everything and anything on this green earth I might be inclined to use on my face for lubrication--the only safe stuff is heavy grease akin to vaseline, and even then I have to read labels. I tried the latest Johnson's samples of baby lotion and baby cream--samples I got in the mail from the Eczema Assn--wonderful feeling! But even that gives me negative--if mild--reaction. However, I had used highly potent stuff like Valisone on my face for too many years--with big problems--but perhaps you and your doctor will have better sense.\nAt the moment I'm alternating between 2.5% and 1% hydrocortisone, with attempts to skip periodically and more consistently use the 1%. When I'm not using the right mix--all touch and go, and trial and error--I'm either highly inflamed or blotchy. Such a lovely choice. It's a tightrope walk. As for ingesting the pills, at 55 I am beginning to have unexplained aching at night of the left hip joint as well as weak knees. I will soon be going for a bone scan and won't be surprised if I have advanced osteoporosis of some joints, probably due to cortisone, esp if other bones are in better shape. Going up and down stairs is more effort than I can ever remember in the past, so I heist myself up with a pull on the rails at each step. Going down stairs reminds me that my joints aren't as fluid as they used to be either. I do understand your euphoria about feeling normal on the pills, tho for me it was all topical stuff then--I thought it was an elixir from the god's when I was in my 20s. I actually forgot that I had always been a freak and began to live and do like everybody else. It lasted about 20 years overall, if I pound it all down into one pot of decent living. I don't have much expectation now for return to any kind of normalcy skinwise. I've run the cortisone course out to its end and am now trying to back off it. Really basically impossible, based on my slow progress to date. I don't think I'll beat the clock.\nElaine, As a female, I can comment on sweatiness definitely being a lousy symptom of menopause. I never ever experienced sweating ever until I hit the curse of curses. If you're not that age, get rid of any of your clothing that doesn't \"breathe\"--my Dr told me never ever to wear fabrics that aren't at least a blend. I can't stand rubber next to my skin either. I'm taking heavy duty antihistamines that clear up my nose and allergy eyes. One other outlet that used to work when I wasn't aware of it--gross involvement and concentration in a specific interest--got my mind off the eczema, or if I was in a situation where I literally could not scratch or was too embarrassed to scratch, I sometimes got past it. But yes, it is the biggest pain in the a--on the planet, and depressing as well.\nI find myself indulging in solitary interests. Drowning in good books is the best outlet of all. I used to take (age 19) Valium but was mostly so groggy I couldn't get to the dinner table when I was called!! haha My philosophy is: Take whatever you need at the moment to get you through it. Sometimes I knock myself out with heavy anti-histamines just before I hit the sack at night--it makes for a truly restful night and ultimately a slightly better start on the next day.\nBrad, I'd love to try more of the herbs and latest Vit's, but my budget doesn't have that much room for trial and error. My derm Dr did mention trying black tea, and at first I thought it reduced inflammation, but I don't know how consistently one must drink it to get benefit. Anyone tried Chinese tea, aside from the mixed concoction that has to be individually tailored to the person?\nNels, A family member of mine has psoriasis and she has used PUVA and other light treatments with good success. As a kid out in the summer pool for three months each year, I hardly recognize myself in pictures because my skin looked fantastic--a light even tan and no blemishes anywhere. But that was before cortisone.\nAhhh, to the mother of Naren--I relate well to your feelings and most everybody else probably does too! From what I've seen, all cotton clothing costs a mint. Know any good seamstress in your city/town who could improvise what you need? My grandmother used to create all her dresses from one pattern, which was very basic. Just cut your pattern out of newspaper and tape it together, cut your material, and sew away. Should be relatively easy since you don't have to worry about esthetics. Just plain cotton sheeting or dish cloth material.\nDistracting the mind is one of the best solutions to itching. I've read that itching is 90 percent psychological, altho at such a young age one may wonder. In my case, I know now (at 55) that my relationship with my mother was central to my disease. Eczema is a two-person disease, to quote from Skin Deep.\nJenny, We all know how stress affects us personally. It's got to be harder to assess your child's personality and figure out what stresses a child. You are right about sensitivity tho. We are all highly sensitized emotionally, psychically, and physically because of how we look and how we feel--all the time. It's hard and impossible for some people to relate even minimally. Sounds like you've worn your child's moccasins a few times. We each interpret stress by our own standards, but how one figures out a child's stresses in advance I haven't a clue. Eczema is all trial and error--try a small patch somewhere and watch it for 24 and 48 hours. That's what my Dr tells me lots of times. Read the labels of everything--even Vitamin E oil may have preservatives in it that might be a problem. And it might work for a long time, and then suddenly it won't anymore. That's when one has become so used to a faithful product, it never occurs to anyone that it might have become a culprit. That's exactly what happened to me and my use of cortisone. It worked for so many years, it took me ten more years to find a dermatologist who finally told me my faithful product had become the source of so much misery. Just be ready to have another reliable product in the wings when you need it.\nDate: 23 Jul 1997 From: Judith Subject: Is cortisone really that bad?\nThis response is for Heather who wondered if cortisone and steroids were really that bad long term. YES!!! Like you, I figured that if it made the eczema go away, why not? Then I found out \"why not\". Prednisone and steroids kick up your blood sugar and I ended up with type 2 diabetes. Now, not only am I covered with itching, weeping open sores that take longer to heal because of the diabetes, but I have to follow an extremely rigid (for me) diet and take yet another medication for the diabetes! So in the long run, taking prednisone brought on more problems than it solved. I have resolved never to take prednisone, cortisone or celestone again for the eczema, even if it means that I look like I have leprosy. The results of diabetes are much more devastating to me - blindness, gangrene, open sores that will get infected, coma and death. Please look at the big picture.\nDate: 23 Jul 1997 From: Jolie Subject: <No subject given>\nJenny- Congrats to you all you are doing will help you figure out what is the ultimate cause to your child's eczema. I personally do not believe in the \"stress\" concept as my child was so called stressed at age 2. Well yes she had behavior problems but as soon as I found the allergen, she was not a \"stressed\" 2 year old anymore. There is a book I used as a guide, available at any Walden Book Store called, Is this your Child? by Dr. Doris Rapp. Read the first three chapters then pick and choose that which fits your child.\nDate: 23 Jul 1997 From: Rachel Subject: my bad derm\nWell folks, I''m sure it will come as a great surprise to you that I never heard a thing from my dermatologist. It just solidifies my decision to stop seeing her.\nIncidentally, my skin is still doing well after my long holiday. I also found a swell apartment that my bo' and I can thoroughly enjoy living in, which is a HUGE load off my back! I am hoping that my eczema will stay in remission for a few weeks. Of course, each day that goes by without discomfort is a gift and I'm relishing it.\nI know I asked you guys this question before, but has anyone experienced hyperlymphitis? (Or swollen glands in regions other than those associated with sore throat.) I'd appreciate any info in that area.\nDate: 23 Jul 1997 From: Linda Subject: Kay and EJ\nKay, So glad to hear that EJ is doing better. You mentioned you don't take him outside at all anymore. My son, Brian (1 yr. old), also has mild allergies to outside things -- grasses, trees, pollen. However, I do take him outside sometimes for family gatherings, etc. His eczema had been doing so well and just the past couple days, it's spreading more on his legs and arms again, and the itching is getting worse. I just have to wonder what is causing it b/c he hasn't been outside very much and no changes in diet. Dust was also low on his list of allergies, but maybe I should try one of those allergy dust sprays that kills dust mites. It's virtually impossible to have a completely dust-free home, unless you hire cleaning people to keep up with it (which I can't afford to do.)\nAnyhow, thanks for the update on EJ -- it's good news!\nTina: Nice that someone is getting more sleep -- you and Kay (not me). Brian had been doing pretty well, waking just once a night. But last night he awoke 2x and the second time, kept on scratching when he was almost asleep so I had to keep getting up and checking on him several times. So it was very hard to get out of bed this morning. Well, I know that there are good days and nights w/eczema.\nDate: 23 Jul 1997 From: Wendy Subject: my bad derm\nI have a couple really swollen, sore lumps on the back of my neck and assume that they are glands. I had a bad reaction to something along my neck and shoulders so I just figured it had to do with that. (I saoked in an oatmeal bath two nights in a row and think that was what caused it.) Hard to tell these days. : ( Anyway, I get these sometimes and they usually go away in a couple days. I'm curious too though and look forward to hearing others responses.\nDate: 23 Jul 1997 From: Debbie Subject: e babies\nOur daughter is 17 mos. old. And we've gone the homeopathy route. I attribute her success to the homeopathy, although it was not an easy go of it. The first remedy was not the right one (after three months: a starter dosage and then an increased dosage). The homeopath had said it's very common to not always get the right remedy for these chronic illnesses... might take a few to get it right, esp. for an infant who cannot speak for themselves. We tried a new one in Dec. She definitely got worse before getting better, which was really tough to take. Especially with everyone related to me being unsupportive about it and acting like I was practically being abusive for not simply appling hydrocortisone.\nAt this point, even my husband was seriously doubting. But then, she cleared up miraculously, for the first time. It was right when I thought I couldn't take it anymore. This took 6 weeks. The homeopath described that she should show progress in waves of the flare-ups being less severe each time, and further apart from each other. It pretty much did happen like that. For the next few months she remained good to great. The homeopath wanted to increase the dosage to prevent even mild flaring that she experiences with teething. Again, she flared. For the next 6 weeks, she remained at a level that was worse than where she'd been for the 3 months prior--but not nearly as bad as she used to be. Then she cleared again---Better than ever.\nThere have been other factors too. The seasons have changed: It is now humid here. But she also eats far more foods now, she pats all kinds of animals, etc.\nWith homeopathy, you're not supposed to give them any medicines. I took that literally with the first remedy. But during the beginning of the second one, I wasn't so sure about the effectiveness of the homeopathy and we really needed sleep. So, I gave her the prescription antihistimine, Atarax. And even applied some hydrocortisones to bad areas or to help prevent bad spots. For a few months she had a dose at bedtime, but about 6 weeks ago, she started giving it to her only as needed... Realized she didn't need it. So for the last month, she's received no Atarax, and barely ever even gets lotion applied to her! Most days she's completely clear with soft baby skin; some days she has a tiny bit in her creases, sm. patch on her face, etc. (nothing that seems to bother her much). It seemed as though the Atarax might have helped heal her intestines as well. And perhaps the chiro. work helped prevent further damage to the intestines... (just conjecture).\nSo, although I did a bunch of things (chiro., changed diet, gave her various supplements... .) this is the only thing that's been consistent. I still stay away from some foods that are just known to cause trouble for little ones, but I have reintroduced a lot of other things back in--even some of the no-no's (wheat on a daily basis, an occasional dairy product, potatoes, etc.)\nSo, my advice is, if you go the homeopathy route, think of it as more of a long-going therapy and less of a medicine. Patience is definitely needed. No quick fixes with homeopathy for chronic illnesses. We started 11 mos. ago! And she's still taking one (since we lost a few months with the first one being wrong). But I'm glad we did it!\nDate: 23 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: Abandon chocolate?\nHi, Linda, Chocolate is on the standard list of things they are always telling you to avoid. However, my recent 4-month incredible beautiful remission from very bad, allover eczema coincided with a 4-month binge on Hershey's kisses. Can't say the chocolate helped improve my skin (unless I had had a hidden magnesium deficiency?), but it obviously did not hurt. Thank goodness, chocolate is not a culprit in my case!\nHowever, if you're having a bad flare-up right now, sometimes a dramatic change in diet (simplification, elimination of all possible allergens) can help alleviate it. Once you get back to a reasonable skin stage, you might be able to eat chocolate again with no bad effect.\nDate: 23 Jul 1997 From: Debbie Subject: To Suzannah re:Pill, and a bonus question for everyone\nMy 17 mos. old daughter's bowel movements do change when her eczema is worse --from normal to orange, loose, soft, and a strong odor.\nDate: 23 Jul 1997 From: Keith Subject: Tights\nI read the posting about EJ and his tights. I did this with my son while he was having his eczema breakouts. He particularly liked the striped ones and would ask to wear those. He was about 2 at the time. It really kept him from tearing the skin up.\nDate: 24 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: medline, chinese herbs\nWell, I'm back from my trip. While I was up there I went to see a Chinese herbal doctor and he mixed together this concotion of 10 herbs (1 was just to lower the bitterness). So far I can't really say much except that it tastes nasty! I took the \"tea\" today (2 times which is recommended) and I didn't take any antihistamine which I normaly do daily. I didn't really itch all day (okay, a tiny bit) so I wonder if I could attribute it to the tea. The stuff is quite expensive (around $8/day) but I was told it will take a while to produce results. I supposably have too much wind/heat/and something else I forget in my body. I still am somewhat of a sceptic about this. I will continue to give my report on this short trial period.\nIf anyone else is taking these (I think someone mentioned it before) herbs please tell me your experience and which herbs are in your mixture. My Chinese is not that great and it will take me a while to translate (if possible) the herbs in my mixture. Also, does anyone know if Evening Primrose Oil will react negatively to this mixture? I was told to strictly to eat hardly any shrimp, beef, and greasy deep fried food (french for examples).\nDate: 24 Jul 1997 From: Marie Subject: I'm new to this\nMy darling baby son has eczema it seems. One friend says, \"Don't feed him any orange juice and it'll go away.\" (pretty simplistic advice, I think). His grandmother says, \"Oh, no, he'll have that forever - I hope it doesn't appear on his face. It's caused by nerves, you know.\" (Whatever in the heck that means!) The doctor says, \"Oh, he has eczema. Here's some hydrocortisone. Apply some every day and it'll go away.\" Actually, it hasn't. My poor baby is constantly scratching and Mommy doesn't know what to do!\nI read in the FAQ that hydrocortisone is a steroid and everyone knows that they are bad. He just turned a year old - a pharmacist told me that they'll have to up the strength of the cream in a couple of years, but already it's just BARELY keeping it manageable (that is, he has red, itchy spots, but none of those horrible oozy sores!) If he has to use the cream for the next seventy-eighty-ninety years (don't laugh - most people in my family pass their eighty-fifth birthday), well, what does this mean?\nYes, I'm a worried Mommy. Could someone PLEASE help me? How important is it to put him in all-cotton? 95% of his clothes are gifts from the grandparents - I can't afford a big outlay. Sigh ... I'll shut up, but could someone please advise me? How worried should I be? Also, forgive me for being shallow on his behalf, but how great a chance is there that it will appear on his beautiful face???? I KNOW what kids are like! Hell, grownups, too!\nDate: 24 Jul 1997 From: Keith Subject: Tonsils\nSomething I forgot to mention on the first posting I did regarding my 5 year old daughters eczema was that her tonsils are huge. The doctor commented on it before her surgery and since I had never really taken a look I did... and WOW they are each about the size of a boulder ( for those of you who played marbles). I wonder if this is an indication that her immune system is in overdrive over something. Any thoughts? Any other eczema sufferers that have large tonsils?\nI don't believe in removal as they are serving a purpose. I think I just need to discover what has been occupying their interest.\nDate: 24 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: Tonsils\nActually I have large tonsils and have always suffered from eczema to varying degrees and so does my sister who is also a sufferer - but not to such an extent as me. So there could be something in this...\nDate: 24 Jul 1997 From: Tina Subject: I'm new to this\nHello, Marie, welcome to the group. You are not shallow to worry about your son's condition, there are a lot of us Mothers out here worrying about the same spots all over our children. My son Daniel has been covered from head to toe at times and it is very hard to deal with--just remeber that your son is dealing with it too and it is hard on him, too. I sometimes forget that and think it is my problem and forget how miserable and itchy he is. By the way, he 21 mos old.\nIf you have read the archives you will see that a lot of the E is worsened by food allergies, but I doubt that just cutting out o.j. will do the trick... . it would be nice though. When did he first start breaking out?\nWe only use the steroid creams when our son gets real bad, since we don't like steroids either.\nI know that kids are cruel and so are the adults. We have been asked by children and adults alike whether our son has the measles, the chicken pox, been in a fire, etc etc etc... gets rather annoying... .\nWell, thats enough for now. Just wanted to let you know there are a lot of us eczema parents out here listening. Oh yah--I haven't noticed that cotton clothes really help my son all that much--just keeping him covered as much as possible so he doesn't scratch open his skin bad. We also use \"free and clear\" type laundry soaps.\nDate: 24 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: Hyperlymphitis, diabetes\nRachel, I get swollen lymph nodes in the sites nearest wherever my skin is inflamed or broken -- can be underarms, in groin, on neck. It occurs so predictably that I don't worry that it is cancer. I take it as a good sign that my lymph system is working as it should (although I hate to be stressing it out so often). When I had early stage breast cancer, I made sure they did not remove any lymph nodes (which they wanted to do just as a \"routine\" check), because I knew I needed *all* of them to deal with my eczema inflammations.\nJudie, I'm sorry to learn you've developed diabetes. It seems to be becoming much more prevalent nowadays, probably because of our diets, and having prednisone kick up our blood sugar is like insult upon injury. It's as if prednisone were saying \"nyah nyah, you can't have good skin without paying the price\".\nAs a long-term prednisone user, but recently on the wagon, I am petrified of developing diabetes myself. I do believe my blood sugar is somewhat out of whack, although it has never shown up on the routine screening tests doctors do, but I have never had a true glucose challenge. I used to have a big sweet tooth, and would eat tons of hard sugar candies at a shot (pure glucose), so I'm afraid I really messed up my sugar-regulating mechanism. (Interestingly, my craving for sugar diminished when I went off prednisone.)\nI was wondering, Judie, how much prednisone you were taking and whether the diabetes showed up while you were still taking it or after you had stopped. In other words, is one always at risk of diabetes because of a history of prednisone use even after stopping it?\nMany thanks for your thoughts about this, and best of luck (and courage) with your treatments. Hopefully the stringent diet will be beneficial to the eczema as well.\nDate: 24 Jul 1997 From: Heather Subject: assorted responses\nRachel, I get a swollen lump under my chin (between jawbone and neck) near one of my chronic eczema spots. It comes and goes, not always related to flare-ups. Does this happen to anyone else?\n>> Skin diseases may substantially diminish a patient's quality of life [... ] Patients typically see these diseasees as more troubling than their physicians do. <<\nI guess that's why they act puzzled when you cry or start ranting. And you should see the look on my face when my pharmacist says,\"Our pharmacy doesn't carry that; you'll have to go to another pharmacy to fill that prescription\" [and pay full price!]\nDebbie, I've noticed that my eczema is worse when I'm a little constipated (others have mentioned this). Also, some foods seem to \"go right through me\" (sorry folks, you can hit \"delete\" right here if this is grossing you out!). Raw carrots and cooked spinach seem as if they don't \"break down\" very much in my system. In case anyone knows: is that just because of the fiber in them?\nDate: 24 Jul 1997 From: Nancy Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nJust as effective and much less messy than ice cubes are those reusable gel packs you keep in the freezer in case of sprains, etc.. You can find them in any pharmacy. I know 3M makes them. I've also used the reusable cold packs used to pack picnic coolers.\nDate: 24 Jul 1997 UT From: David Subject: Tonsils\nI for one find the question about having larger tonsils interesting because I do have enlarged tonsils or at least I frequently have suffered with tonsilitis and inflammation there which no-one else I know has to deal with.\nDate: 24 Jul 1997 From: Megan Subject: tonsils\nI didn't start to get eczema until I was in my early twenties, but I have always had, and still do have huge tonsils, I've probably had strep throat 16 times, and it get worse every time, I was so sick from it last fall (during a hurricane as well) that I definitely would have had my tonsils removed if I had had health insurance. I don't remember the exact link, but I can remember my pediatrician telling my mother & I that my big tonsils had something to do with the fact that I contracted strep throat so frequently. Maybe Kelly can tell us a little more about the relationship between tonsils and our immune systems. Aren't tonsils just big lymph nodes?\nDate: 24 Jul 1997 From: John Subject: Lecithin\nLecithin, anyone? I have a friend who credits the ingesting of powdered lecithin mixed in any handy liquid (Ugh! It doesn't dissolve) for eliminating her facial psoriasis. My son-in-law says lecithin capsules twice a day have improved his mild case of eczema. Another friend who runs a horse farm says she feeds lecithin to the horses \"to keep their coats smooth and silky\".\nI've just finished a bottle of 100 capsules at the rate of one 2x per day and have great improvement in my mild case of eczema. Problem is, the improvement coincides with the arrival of summer weather and a daily dip in the lake and several visits to the beach. So I have no way of knowing what the reason for the improvement is. Has anyone tried it? Guess it's just ground up soy beans... Be of good cheer. No matter how gross your eczema it's better than not being able to breathe from an acute asthma attack.\nDate: 7 Jun 1997 From: Robin Subject: tonsils/cotton clothing\nRegarding large tonsils, yes, I have been told that my daughter's tonsils are abnormally large - this is an interesting thread - what might the significance of this be?\nFor Marie and her son: I'm so sorry that you and your son are struggling with this disease. My 2.5 year old daughter has had severe eczema all her life. Things that have made a noticeable difference include:\ndiscovering and eliminating allergens\ndaily 20 minute+ soaks in a cool bath, followed by Aquafor\n100% cotton clothing and bedding washed in hypoallergenic detergent and\nhumidifier in her bedroom.\nShe's not \"cured\" but at least I don't have strangers commenting anymore on her face - I just want to scream when these helpful souls say, in front of her, \"is there something wrong with that baby?\" or \"does she have a rash?\" - or my all-time favorite: \"have you taken that baby to a doctor - she looks like she has a skin problem.\" I used steroids on her a lot at the beginning, based on the recommendations of the dermos. Now, I don't and won't. The rebound when I stop or taper off is always worse for her, anyway - the risks to this little one are just not worth it, IMHO.\nDate: 25 Jul 1997 From: Carol Subject: Medline\nI found this blurb in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL on 7/17/97. I have not accessed it myself, so you are on your own!\n\"Thanks to PubMed, consumers finally can get free access to Medline, the medical database managed by the National Institute of Health's National Library of Medicine. The database contains 8.6 million summaries and abstracts from 3,800 medical journals.\nhttp://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/PubMed/\nDate: 25 Jul 1997 From: Marie Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nI guess I want it to just GO away. When I think about it, I realize I'm angry. He's the most beautiful child in the world - very German looking (throw-back - he looks like his maternal great-grandparents!), with fine blond hair and blue eyes and a smile that charms everyone. I thought he might end up in modeling. I guess I feel cheated. I know that most of you have been dealing with this for a while, and my concerns - at the moment - are centered around my angel's appearance. But why does MY baby have to have this awful condition?! Did I do something wrong? AM I doing something wrong? And why didn't the doctor give me any real information beyond \"He seems to have eczema.\"?\nI'm sorry that Daniel is so bad. Maybe I'm lucky that Alexander's seems to be mild, but, oh, the horror in his grandmother's voice when I said he has patches on his knees, insteps, arms, a little on the back of his shoulders, and a constantly itchy bum (at least the last one I know he can't scratch, so it doesn't get very red or inflamed!!!)\nHow do you track down allergies in a baby? Since there are many, many allergies in my family, and most of them very serious, I wanted to get allergy tests on him. I was told not until he's four! Four! Another three years! I keep him away from anything that I'm allergic to, and we severely limit and monitor his exposure to animals, but I'm not sure what else to do. As for when he started breaking out, the patch on his instep was really always there, mostly as an extremely dry, rough spot. When he has shoes on, it flares up (and when he doesn't, people scold me for having my baby outside without shoes - can't win for losing!). Aloe vera lotion on it to sooth the dryness caused an instant allergic reaction (both legs turned bright red and hot and he screamed like he was burning - cold milk soothed THAT!) He was born in the summer, and we were really careful to keep him extremely cool, since he was so young, so we never saw any real flare ups. But then, this summer, as soon as the temperature hit about 25C, red patches started appearing on his skin. When he scratched one patch raw and oozing, I went to see the doctor. Now, I at least know not to take him out when it's very hot out, because the sun makes his skin red and blotchy, like it does me. I know I'm supposed to use sunscreen on him when we go out, but it makes his skin red, so I just keep him covered and under shade.\nThe doctors may think of thinning skin as a minor side effect, but it really concerns me. Especially since the cream will eventually be ineffective, I'm told, and he'd need oral steroids. That REALLY worries me.\nI guess I'm feeling a new empathy. However - and forgive me if I upset anyone - I keep thinking of a woman I knew. She always wore long sleeves, high necks, long skirts or pants, never a bathing suit or shorts, and she wouldn't touch anyone. She was in her thirties and had never had a date - not because she wasn't a nice person, but because of the way she had been treated by people in the past. My son is gorgeous - I mean, it amazes me that such a beautiful boy came from the two of us - and I'm just terrified of him FEELING like an outcast, a monster - whatever it is that she felt like to make her hide herself from everyone.\nDate: 25 Jul 1997 From: Jolie Subject: e babies\nTo add to the homeopathic discussion, this is how remedies are made. Take the main ingrediant place a drop of this substance in a quart of sterial water, shake it up then poor several drops of this into the next quart bottle of sterial water. Repeat this 30x. Yes this is the number on the bottle! This is how many times it was diluted. Homeopathic remedies are benine. You can eat the entire bottle of pills with no side effects. How does it work? The identical method as immunizations, the body heals against the microscopic amount and therefore heals the whole. In the hey days of medical confrontations (1920's) it was the allopathic healers versus the homeopathic healers. The allopathics won the financial fight and we now know them as our medical doctors as opposed to allopathic healers. The only concept that the allopathic doctors adopted from the homepathic doctors was the concept of immunizations. I use homepathic remedies on my entire family with great success. As a side note, I did have the opportunity to talk to the CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Maryland. He was on Hilary Clinton's alternative medicine review pannel. When I asked him about homeopathic medicine he said, we know homeopathy works. When asked why the insurer does not cover homeopathy, he said \"IT WOULD PUT TO MANY DOCTORS OUT OF BUSINESS\". Unbelievable!\nDate: 25 Jul 1997 From: Jolie Subject: To: Marie\nMarie, see if you can isolate the CAUSE. Creams and medicines only cover up the symptoms. Start a food/location chart. Where was he what did he eat when was he worse, better, etc. You may have success with this approach.\nDate: 25 Jul 1997 From: Rachel Subject: large tonsils\nI, too, have gi-normo tonsils. It's never really been a problem. But I am very intrigued that so many of us have big tonsils. If you hear anything, do tell!\nAlso, while I was on holiday, I picked up something called \"Sedax\", which is a pure form of glyceride, or something like that anyway. It is used to stop itchiness. It actually seems to work. Has anyone ever heard of it, or anything comperable?\nDate: 25 Jul 1997 From: Kai Subject: Acupuncture as a cause ??\nThe climate is very hot and dry here in summer and cold and (dry in winter. My eczema is worse in winter than in summer, mainly because I'm covered most of the time in winter.\nI had eczema as a baby, it seemed I had outgrown it until I was about seven years old when I started having trouble with hay fever, which over the next years worsened until I was asthmatic almost all of the time. In 1985 (when I was 13) I went to a Korean acupuncturist who promptly got rid of all the hay fever symptoms and my asthma within a few sessions. Three years later 'old friend' eczema started showing its face on my arms again (and spreading to the rest of my body over the years). I went to various derms and allergists, up to now they narrowed my allergy down to mainly plants and pollen.\nNow: Has anybody had experience with acupuncture? Ultimately: Did acupuncture cause my eczema ?\nDate: 25 Jul 1997 From: Linda Subject: Marie and E Moms\nMarie, My son (almost 1 yr. old) has had eczema practically since birth. He had it much more severely in the beginning. We found out he has many allergies that affect his skin condition and that has helped with his improvement. Regarding face eczema, the derm. originally told me it is always a FOOD allergy when it appears on the face. The environmental allergens contribute more to the rest of the body. I don't know if other eczema sufferers have been told the same thing.\nIf you haven't seen a dermatologist (specialist) for your baby, I would definitely do that first and see what he/she recommends. The other thing you might want to try in the meantime is wet wrapping arms and legs with gauze after applying just plain water or medication/ointment. Another idea mentioned on here was wrapping with cotton diapers (cut into strips).\nAs far as clothes, I usually buy mostly all cotton, but never avoided certain other fabrics. It's something to consider though. I too have eczema and know that those fleecy materials for winter clothing make me very itchy (although they seem very soft to the touch).\nDate: 25 Jul 1997 From: Tina Subject: naturopath for my E child\nI just wanted to tell everyone that I took Daniel to his first Naturopath appt. It was interesting, to say the least. She drew blood from his ear to test for toxins and food intolerances. Also she looked at his eyes for some Iris test that is suppose to tell you where some of your problems are. Looking at Daniel's, she said stomach and skin... well, that would probably mean his food allergies and eczema.\nWe will be going back in a week for the blood test results and plan of action.\nJust thought you would like to know... .has anyone done this blood test before?\nDate: 25 Jul 1997 From: Tina Subject: to Marie\nMarie, You should try and see another allergist..We have an HMO that didn't seem to want to do much until I started really complaining. They tried telling me that Daniel couldn't have allergies yet, as a baby and that nothing is passed through breast milk. Why do they tell you not to smoke or do drugs then? Daniel was 1 year old when he was tested for allergies. First they did a blood test because his skin was so red and inflamed they wouldn't have been able to get accurate results from the skin test. Then after a couple of weeks of steroid creams and antihistimines they did a skin test. I would definitely recommend it. If he has a peanut allergy it could be deadly. Daniel has a list of probably 30 things... .\nThe naturopath we saw for the first time today said we need to cut the antihistimes out and steroid creams because that is suppressing the eczema and it could come out in another form, such as asthma.\nDate: 25 Jul 1997 From: Judith Subject: prednisone and Diabetes\nAs a long-term prednisone user, but recently on the wagon, I am petrified of developing diabetes myself. I do believe my blood sugar is somewhat out of whack, although it has never shown up on the routine screening tests doctors do, but I have never had a true glucose challenge. I used to have a big sweet tooth, and would eat tons of hard sugar candies at a shot (pure glucose), so I'm afraid I really messed up my sugar-regulating mechanism. (Interestingly, my craving for sugar diminished when I went off prednisone.)\nI was wondering, Judie, how much prednisone you were taking and whether the diabetes showed up while you were still taking it or after you had stopped. In other words, is one always at risk of diabetes because of a history of prednisone use even after stopping it?\nMany thanks for your thoughts about this, and best of luck (and courage) with your treatments. Hopefully the stringent diet will be beneficial to the eczema as well.\nDate: 25 Jul 1997 From: Stewart Subject: update\nThe air conditioner (AC) in any car has mold and fungi in it! Because it is damp, dark and poorly ventilated (when not on). Once you start the AC, you are essentially blowing the mold and fungi into the car. The way I find useful to combat this: Turn the heater on! (yeah, yeah, I know it's hot out.) for one minute before leaving for your destination. Now you could turn the AC on. Around a minute before arriving to your venue, turn your heater back on.\nThe heater should kill the mold and fungi in your AC. Hopefully this method makes a more pleasant ride for your young one. This should be good for Asthma suffers also.\nPS-- I usually keep the windows wide open once the heater is on. Once the AC is on I close the windows.\nDate: 26 Jul 1997 From: Sandra Subject: Breastfeeding & Eczema???\nMy 6-month old son, Christopher, has had eczema since the age of 3 months.. it first appeared on his face-the first time, I didn't know it was eczema until it got REALLY BAD, sigh... Anyway-it's AMAZING how I've been getting different advices from different doctors, friends, etc.\nHis pediatrician recommended that I use .5% hydrocortizone, the stuff you get over the counter, followed by Aquaphor. I did that and it didn't seem to help. Now at age 6 months, we saw a dermatologist for the first time. He prescribed Hitone (2-1/2% hydrocortisone) with Atarax (an anti-anxiety drug to help him sleep at night). I felt EXTREMELY uneasy about using both medications but he assured me it was safe.\nI'm not sure how severe some of the kids eczema on this n/g is but Christopher's seems to come and go every 3-4 days. Eczema lingers for 2 days sometimes 3 days and then goes away.\nFor the first time (1 day ago) his eczema flared up across his chest. Usually it's only on his face... .I was desperate.. I used the hitone for the first time and even gave him 1/2tsp of the atarax to help him sleep...\nDay 2: I bought Aveeno(colloidal oatmeal) bath. I also bought a bottle of their lotion. I read somewhere on the net that lanolin can do more harm than good so I switched lotions, AGAIN. I have SO many brands of creams/lotions.. Amazing enough, the Aveeno seems to be helping. BTW: Dermo told me to bath him only once a week. I think that actually caused his eczema to flare up along his body.. The aveeno bath and lotion seemed to re-hydrate his body.\nBREASTFEEDING: I'm also breastfeeding still. Doctor says what I'm eating won't effect Christopher's eczema but I really question it. If I eat chocolate or dairy products it seems to make his eczema worse. I'm going to experiment and rotate my diet around to see if it helps. Has anyone tried this??\nDate: 26 Jul 1997 From: Jolie Subject: naturopath for my E child\nTina, I am very interested in this alternative method. I too visited a natropath but I was unable to follow his advice since my son was on such a few number of foods. I hope to follow up with him as soon as I find an alternative to the Alimentum formula. He believed the sugar levels in the formula were throwing his system off. He cannot have milk or soy and is allergic to brown rice which is what rice milk is made of. There is a new product on the shelves I want to try, a multi-grain milk.\nDate: 26 Jul 1997 From: Charlie Subject: Dump the derms\nAll in favour say yes!! My daughters' derm insists that there is no relationship between her eczema and what she eats.\nDate: 26 Jul 1997 From: Elaine Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nNancy, Yes I too use the gel packs, but after 2 minutes, they've lost their punch. I need it reeeeeeaaalllll cold!\nRe asthma, I know you'd think that not being able to breathe is worse than eczema, but I for one, would rather not be able to breathe every once in a while than to constantly suffer from itching, redness, peeling, flaking, social embarassment, pain, and general distress!!! My hunch is I'm not alone...\nDate: 26 Jul 1997 From: Tina Subject: Breastfeeding & Eczema???\nMy son's eczema goes in cycles, also. His face will be clear for about 3 days, then he starts getting red bumps for about 2 days, then gets real scaly for 2-3 days, then he gets up in the morning looking smooth and clear again. Then we start all over.\nBathing--you have to do what you feel and your baby feel comfortable with. My son does about the same no matter how much we bathe him. But this being summertime he is getting very dirty playing outside so he needs a bath every night. We just make sure we moisturize well after.\nBreastfeeding--My general practioner said that what I was eating couldn't be a problem. I don't believe that. The Naturopath we saw yesterday said that when we breastfeed *our* food intolerances affect the baby. Not the baby's. I don't know what is true though.\nDate: 26 Jul 1997 From: Kim Subject: Dump the derms\nThe Derm we saw said no relation to what is eaten or nutrition. Dump the Derms.\nDate: 26 Jul 1997 From: Helen Subject: babies with e...\nLinda, I've never heard this but we have just been going to our family doctor for eczema--she has to give us a referral to see the derm and has been unwilling to do so and it's been okay. Things are actually good with Daniel, 2 1/2, now, but whenever he had eczema on his face I would have had a hard time believing it was a food allergy. It is possible because I haven't tried to narrow it down, but we seem to be reacting more to weather. In the winter it got really bad on his face, but now in the summer it's better but we are also using baking soda in his bath and that seems to really smoothe down his skin. He hardly ever has bumps on his face these days, but has been itching other places the past few days.\nDate: 27 Jul 1997 From: Janice Subject: reply to parents!\nTO: Sandra: I have a three-year-old with eczema and my biggest bit of advice is stick with this group for a while. You'll learn tons... not necessarily black and white answers, but lots of ideas to try and lots of helpful people who care. There is a lot of email to wade through each day, so it would be easy to give up. Keep reading!\nHere's a few thoughts: At your son's age, my daughter had lots of eczema on her face... always flared when she was teething. I am still not clear on the cortisone cream debate, but from what I have read here I have backed way off and only use it in extreme emergencies and I would never get it near the face. She hasn't had eczema on her face since she got all her teeth (crossing my fingers!) She has it all over her legs, exp. behind knees and tops of feet/toes. Also inside elbows and on her hands.\nHeat and sweat seem to be particular irritants in her case. I did some experimenting with food early on, but it is so hard to get her to eat anything I'm holding off on real hard core diet experiments until she is older. She's already pretty skinny! My dr. said the same thing about baths, so we faithfully only gave her one or two baths a week for her first 2.5 years. Now (again, after joining the list) we have been bathing her almost daily and swimming a lot, too. Hasn't made it worse, sometimes seems better, esp. now that it is summer... . we are washing all the sweat off which probably helps.\nWe have been using baking soda baths (approx. 1/2 cup per bath). They must feel good... she now asks for them! We also slather her in lotion without drying her skin after bath, which seems to have helped. We really like Cetaphil creme (not lotion). It is almost the consistency of Crisco. We have been buying it by the \"tub\" for about $7.50 at Costco.\nDate: 27 Jul 1997 From: David Subject: Homeopathy, Lanolin, Skin-Cap\nHOMEOPATHY\nThere was some discussion recently about homeopathic principles, and the preparation of homeopathic medicines. Vaccination was stated to be homeopathic. Here are a few thoughts, perhaps not directly entitled to be on this list, 'cos they don't bear directly on eczema. However, it might prove helpful as background info for any trying homeopathy.\nHomeopathic medicines, which may be of animal, vegetable or mineral origin, are prepared by SERIAL DILUTION & SUCCUSSION, usually from a MOTHER TINCTURE made by macerating the medicine (say a plant) in alcohol. SERIAL DILUTION is usually either CENTECIMAL or DECIMAL, and takes place as follows (we will illustrate centecimal dilution): One measure of tincture is added to 99 equal measures of diluent (possibly alcohol or water, let's say water). This gives, obviously, a dilution of 1 in 100, which is called the First Centecimal Potency, and is written 1C. To make 2C, one measure of 1C is added to 99 measures of water. 2C thus has 1 measure of tincture in 10,000 of water. One measure of 2C further diluted by adding to 99 measures of water brings us to 3C, which has one part original tincture in a million parts water. 4C in one part medicine in a hundred million parts water. 6C, a commonly used potencey, has one part tincture to a million million parts water. Decimal potency is similar, but uses a ratio of 1 plus 9, rather than 1 plus 99. Now, by the time we get to 30C potency, we are getting to extreme dilution. (Paradoxiacally, higher dilutions are supposed to be more potent) We started with a finite number of molecules of the medicine, and at some point (after a thing called Avogadro's number) there simply isn't any medicine left, just water. As someone put it, it's like mixing a gram of something (say graphite, a homeopathic remedy) with a mass the size of Jupiter. What's the chance, if you could grab a handful of your Jupiter mix, that it'd have any of your graphite in it? This extreme dilution is a great stumbling block to orthodox scientists, for which, if good supporting evidence is lacking, they can't be blamed. Here's where the crucial SUCCUSSION comes in. At each stage of the serial dilution, the mix is vigorously, agressively shaken, or 'succussed'. It is thought that this causes some non-material 'pattern' to be imprinted from the medicine to the vehicle (the water). This is thought to take place at a sub-atomic, quantum physics level. Has it been demonstrated? Not yet, so far as I know. I should mention in passing that the principle of using tiny dilutions is secondary to the main homeopathic one of 'like cures like' Note too that 'Like' is not 'Same'. Symptoms of Lead poisoning would not neccessarily be treated with homeopathic dilutions of lead. Treating same with same is more strictly called 'Isopathy' Conventional vaccinations are more Isopathic than Homeopathic. Homeopathic doctors aren't keen on vaccinations, as they introduce material doses of pathological substances into the bloodstream. Also, vaccinations work by causing the body to produce antibodies in the blood, while homeopathic medicines ares supposed to work on a more subtle level. So it isn't strictly correct to call vaccinations homeopathic. It's worth mentioning (OK, maybe it isn't!) that there are different 'schools' or lines of thought that developed, in homeopathy. In continental Europe the trend is for lower potency (less dilute) medicines containing a number of different mediicinal substances, while in Britain 'Classical' homeopathy is followed, in which the Single Remedy is used. In Britain, to join the Faculty of Homeopath (MFHom) you have to be already medically qualified (at least MB ChB) before you can undertake the training, so that it's an ADDITIONAL, postgraduate, qualification. Homeopathy is available on the National Health Service. The Glasgow Homeopathic hospital is a world leader. There is also, however, a parallel strand of private practitioners who have done other homeopathy courses but are not orthodoxly medically qualified. Where do I stand on all this? Open minded, and fairly widely read. (Also, impatient of waffle, woolly thinking and pseudo-science.) One pharmacologist said, of homeopathic ideas of potency \"It's like saying, the less whisky you drink, the more drunk you get!\" It would appear at the moment that there is no way in physics to explain how homeopathic dilutions could work. Nonetheless, looking at it the other way round, if it can be proved statistically that it does work, then we'll need to look again at physics! So, has it been proved, eg, in controlled 'double-blind' trials? Some studies do appear to have gone some way in that direction. However, it'd take a great mass of unequivocal evidence before the thing would be considered proven enough to amend physics. More work is needed. Meantime, I don't think an informed interest, and personal trial, would do any harm. (Actually, I'm inclined to believe there might be something to it, even though it would seem to mean that one drop of vinegar in the ocean changes the planet irrevocably.) I'd stress that my interest is entirely a lay one, and I'm open to correction if any spot errors.\nLANOLIN\nMakers of some emollients seem keen to stress that they don't contain Lanolin. (Lanolin is sheep sebum). There is a perception that many people are sensitive or allergic to Lanolin. A couple of years ago a very well researched and annotated article in \"Exchange\" the National Eczema Society magazine, showed that this notion is quite false, based on a large statistical error subsequently uncorrected, in studies in the USA decades ago. Also, employing Lanolin of dubious purity, containing wool alcohols. (It should be mentioned that the man who wrote the article works for a firm producing medical-grade lanolin! Nevertheless, it was a rigorous article.) Ever since this article, I've been annoyed by adverts for emollients that say virtuously \"Contains no Lanolin\". Why perpetuate a mistake, and make a virtue out of it? Now, however, (at least, in May 96) the Advertising Standards Authority in Britain has upheld a complaint against a company for precisely this. The ASA has a website where you can find this - I've lost the address at the moment.\nSKIN-CAP\nThe wicked, wicked Skin-Cap people seem now to be thoroughly discredited. Something occurs to me however: The product was found to contain steroids. People said it worked, and the steroid was evidently why. BUT, did it work better than other preparations of those same steroids? Might there in fact be a case for a legitimate product containing Zinc Pyrithione and triamcinolon or clobetasol?\nDate: 27 Jul 1997 From: Dale Subject: breast feeding - derm is wrong\nThe comment that a derm. told you that what you ate would't exaccerbate your son's ezcema seems wrong on the face of it. Virtually any mom that has breast fed will give you examples of the effect of her diet on the baby. If they don't want you taking drugs because it will get in the milk, why wouldn't food you eat also get in the milk?\nI used to teach pre-Med students at Northwestern when I was a grad student there in the 60's, and they seemed pretty smart. I can only conclude that later in Med school or out in practice the dumb genes get activated and the common sense ones get deactivated?! Of course, there are a few Doc's out there with an open mind and common sense -- but it is the old needle in the haystack routine to find them.\nDate: 27 Jul 1997 From: Tom Subject: Breast feeding and eczema in your baby.\nI'm not sure if your Derm got his degree from Mickey Mouse university. It is a fact known for years that when you eat foods highly allergic your baby will flare up. It does pass through mom's milk to the infant. As you have already done, start monitoring your foods and eliminating suspicious ones (as long as you breast feed) and you will see his eczema clear up. (As long as he isn't eating anything causing it.) Another small note from my allergist and other doctors: The longer you breast feed the more secure your child will be as he/she grows up and the lower the risk of developing long term allergies. My allergist has suggested as much as 1 year of breast feeding.\nDate: 27 Jul 1997 From: Robert Subject: prednisone and Diabetes\nIf you are suseptible to diabetes, prednisone will put your blood sugar in the diabetic range (over 120)... I have had it happen to me and my sister became diabetic very young (30's) and she used prednisone a lot. I once had an experience with my derm where he wanted to put me on prednisone and I said \"will this make me (bring on) diabetes.\" He said \"if you are prone to diabetes, it will show up while you are taking the prednisone and then your blood sugars will return to normal.\" I said to him, \"can you guarantee that my taking this prednisone will not make me a diabetic?\" He thought about it awhile and than said that \"he thought I should hold up on the prednisone for awhile.\" So, like everything else in life, there are no guarantees, but diabetes is another reason to avoid taking prednisone until the eczema is absolutely unbearable.\nDate: 27 Jul 1997 From: Kay Subject: Eczema and breastfeeding\nWanted to put my two cents in here as a breast feeding mom who has had experience with SIX children. Food allergies are DEFINITELY aggravated by Mom's diet. You don't even have to be an E-kid to get into trouble on this one. Some of my children (not E-kids) would have bloody, mucousy diarrhea and failure to thrive when I drank or ate milk products. We went to the emergency room at five days (my milk had sufficiently come in, DUH!) for two of them, not connecting two-and-two. I gave up on the first two, studied hard before my third in the Index Medicus (before the Internet and you guys!), realized that my diet could adversely affect my little ones, and have successfully nursed the last four.\nWhen I stray, there is heck to pay. As they wean down their frequency, I can dabble into forbidden dainties with a minimum of suffering on their part. You will laugh when I tell you that I couldn't figure out for a while why EJ was ALWAYS grumpy Saturday night/ early Sunday morning. I looked like I was hung over each Sunday at church. It was awful. Then we figured it out. Bill and I have our \"date night\" on Saturday night. I usually deviated from my diet and would find nuts, chocolate, and seafood at the salad bar. Eureka! Now that I have changed my ways, he sleeps all night unless his eczema is acting up due to other causes.\nAre my kids odd? Absolutely. They definitely have proven immunodeficiency problems relating to genetic defects of the small intestines: eczema is just our latest wrinkle in the equation. Is my observation a universal truth? Nah. But I am positive that food allergens CAN cross from mom's milk. Positive.\nEJ's eczema and general miserable tendencies during the night were directly attributed AT TIMES (not always) to my nursing, but we have still not weaned (20 months) because solid food definitely affected him MORE and my ped. and I feel the nutrition and immune goodies in my breast milk outweigh the indiscretions. Big offenders (I eat and he is miserable) are peanuts, seafood, milk products, chocolate, and beef.\nExperiment away with your diet. Record your findings. Wait a while and do a \"challenge\" when other factors are calm. Your child's best advocate is YOU.\nDate: 27 Jul 1997 From: Keith Subject: Baby/breastfeeding and eczema\nSandra, Your son sounds a lot like what was going on with my son at the same age. My little guy had terrible eczema on his face and body at 3 months on up. At age 6 months I was feeling desparate and could not see how it could be a food allergy since he was only being breastfed. I finally got to the point that I thought maybe he was allergic to me, so I quit breastfeeding. It was a cold turkey kind of thing that I do not recommend:).\nAnyways, I was trying Soy formula and anything and still the eczema would not clear. The doctor said use the hydrocortisone and all that jazz. We also dicked around thinking different foods were the culprit because he was starting on solids. We did find he reacted to corn, but in a different way. One day in a health food store I came across Rice Dream rice milk. He was a year old so I thought that this was one alternative I didn't try. I bought the enriched and his skin started to clear within a few weeks, though I used some cortisone on some tough spots behind the knee and stuff. He now has beautiful skin and he is nearly four and has had since at least 18 months.\nHe still has rice milk but can now tolerate small amounts of dairy ( string cheese ) every few days or so. If he has a lot of dairy stuff in a row he will start to itch. It seems that his eczema was food allergy related and is managed with the rice milk which he loves. I was mad about ending the breastfeeding after all this was found out. If I had eliminated the dairy from my diet he would have been fine. You do pass on milk proteins etc in the breastmilk. I would have been passing on a dairy farms worth because I really focussed on drinking enough milk, eating cheese etc. so I would be healthy too. Could've taken supplements and managed my nutrition.\nThe rice milk would be worth a try as would eliminating dairy from your diet completely while breastfeeding.\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Sandra Subject: Breastfeeding and Eczema\nThis is what I have done since my posting 3 days ago.\nDay 3 of baby's eczema: I dusted the house/vacuumed/steam cleaned carpets from top to bottom. Closed off all the windows and am using air conditioning and HEPA filter AIR cleaner on full blast in bedroom where baby sleeps. Since I'm breastfeeding, I'm on a oven roasted chicken with rice and salad (italian dressing) meal. I want to see if it's my diet. As hard as it is, I'm staying away from the chocolate ice cream, and dairy products.\nBaby's diet: breastmilk, apples with rice cereal, sweet potato\nEvery evening I give him an Aveeno bath followed by Aveeno moisturizing cream (w/o lanolin).\nRESULTS: Day 4: The eczema has gotten better. It seems to have subsided for the time being (knock on wood)... He sleeps through the night and starts to itch, not as much as he used to, at around 5AM.. As soon as he wakes up he doesn't itch at all..\nNow the question I'll have to deal with is, is it my diet, or is it the dust bunnies? In either case, I'll have to monitor my diet and gradually add the dairy products, tomato based food, and fish and see how my little one reacts to each.\nDate: 27 Jul 1997 From: Mike Subject: Introduction and Questions\nI have suffered on and off since I was 5. I have consistently had the problem since I was 23. Some of you appear to have worse cases than mine, but it's nice to know there are others out there who understand and can sympathize with the situation. I have been reading through the recent commmunications and have read through the FAQ's. I am attempting to make a controlled approach to some of the alternatives and ideas that have been presented. In my case, I know stress is a serious factor. As with all of us, I would like to pose a few questions to the group and hopefully I will soon be able to contribute with the rest.\nI have eczema all over. The worst is on my scalp (often looks like a snow storm around my desk at work from the dry skin), face and in the genital region (seriously, and this can be really uncomfortable). Does anyone out there have some possible controls for the latter. Obviously, this is a difficult area to treat. I will be attempting to work on my scalp and face with some of the other methodologies recommended.\nSecond, during recent scuba dive trips I have noticed that my skin does extremely well. I have formulated several possible reasons. 1) I'm on vacation and therefore less stressed. 2) Exposure to the sun and UV. 3) During the dives there is long term exposure to salt water. Does any one have any thoughts on the salt water as a possible treatment? If so, some details please. It does sting a little during the first few exposures when my skin is still broken. But after a few dives and days it is not a problem.\nMy last question concerns hypnosis or subliminal suggestion as an alternative method for controlling the desire to scratch. Has anyone tried this? I am assuming it would be similar to those who have used it for smoking cessation or weight loss.\nDate: 27 Jul 1997 From: Sage Subject: Tina with Daniel in the car\nLast year when I was in the car a lot during the summer and the air conditioning didn't help, I started bringing a bag of ice with me to put on the itching areas. This helped a lot. Then I used J. Roth Foundation's therapy and stopped having so much trouble with sweat.\nNow I use just baking soda in the bath and mostly grapeseed oil as a moisturizer plus almond and avocado oil, and sometimes jojoba. I am better than ever!\nDate: 27 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: Elaine/Howard/DoxepinLessItching/Prozac/Eczema/\nElaine, Ask your doctor about the antidepressant Doxepin. It was prescribed for reducing itching. It works. I take it about 5pm or earlier, depending on my bedtime. I take it about 2-3 hours before bedtime, or anytime I'm itchy and/or depressed. One of doctors said it gives you a boost. That might be true, depending on the dose. He suggested a maintenance dose of 10 mg a day at bedtime or 30 when you are itchy.\nAs far as any other meds that aggravate eczema, I could give you a list of antibiotics that bother me, but they might not bother you. Sulpha too.\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Jolie Subject: Breastfeeding to Sandra\nOf coarse what you eat directly effects your son's eczema. My son's eczema totally covered his body at age 4 months. We never slept a night, in the morning his bed was all bloody. I switched from straight breast feeding to formulas, to changing my diet, putting him on raw goats milk. Every change effected his e differently. Perhaps for adults, eczema is not directly related to food intake, but food seems to be the main culprit for those of us with eczema babies. We have even swapped lists of tolerable foods. See the archives.\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Sue Subject: cheap cotton sleepers\nWe solved the need for cheap cotton footed sleepers by sewing socks into regulary cotton jumpsuits. I didn't have trouble finding the cotton jumpsuits cheap at yard sales; I sewed cotton socks into them, either by hand or machine. You can do this with stretch cotton pants, too. The advantage of this method is that you can then put the kid's shoes on and go out without them looking like they're in pajamas...\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Sheila Subject: naturopath for my E child\nHi, I am very interested in what the Naturopath says. We have taken our baby to a Homeopath and they told us the eczema was due to food. If the food is not digested properly it could cause eczema. I would like to here what the Naturopath has to say!!\nMy dermatologist doesn't seem to have a thorough understanding of what eczema is all about. Looking at the different information provided within this group looks like all derms are like that. The suggestions given by my homeopath seems to work. She said to give my baby a massage in the back next to the spine and below the hip bone. This supposed to cause bowel movements and clear your stomach. She gave us a food chart which basically has lots of greens and fruits. My baby's eczema doesn't seem to erupt as long as I take care of her diet, making sure she has enough fiber in her food.\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Sheila Subject: Breastfeeding &Eczema???\nHi Sandra, I am sorry to hear about you son's eczema!!! I can understand how it must be for you since I had the same problem.\nMy baby started having eczema when she was 3 months old. It started on her face at first and then all over her body. We thought it was prickly heat since it was in summer but found later that it was eczema. My pediatrician recommended hydrocortizone also! But those don't work.\nThe best thing that seemed to work for me is aveeno. I used to massage the aveeno oil on her before her bath. Use the aveeno powder on the skin instead of soap and use aveeno mosturiser. This seemed to help a lot. I used to give her baths everyday. Until this took effect I used to apply cortisone everyday. Cortisone causes skin discoloration. I am not sure if the discoloration will eventually go away or not!!! Try to avoid hydrocortisone and go for the aveeno, it helps a lot!!!\nBut most of all the diet is very important. What you eat will definitely effect her. Chocolate will definetely make eczema worse. 100%cotton clothes will definetely give relief than synthetic for people suffering with eczema. Don't expect miracles! Keep on applying mosturizer and the massages. You will slowly see difference within some months. Also vitamins help I think.\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Victor Subject: Eczema and Fertility\nI have had eczema since I was 12 years old. It flared up pretty badly the past few weeks. I still could not trace the cause although I am on a \"safe\" diet not. My eczema has spread to my groin area and I am applying Betnovate there. I now need at full strength to keep the eczema in check.\nMe and my wife are also trying to start a family but without much success. Does anyone knows whether steroids have any effect on fertility (ie; sperm count, sperm viability, etc). I noticed that my skin temperature is also quite high when compared to my wife's, even after I had just taken a shower. Does this also have an effect on fertility because high temperature will denature the sperms. Also will steroids applied to groin area affect normal sperm production? I don't want to end up with a deformed baby.\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: ARRGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\nOkay an update on my eczema. Well, first of all I have taking Chinese Herbal Therapy. I didn't think it has done much for me but now I definitely notice smoother skin, less puffiness, less itching, and less redness. In fact, I have been able to use less anti-histamines to control the itching.\nNow, the bad news, which is really not related to CHT (Chinese Herbal Therapy). I have gotten a really bad staph infection along with possibly some viral infection. It started out as a small patch on my chin and has now taken over the right side of my face and is starting to creep over to the left. It is also beginning to appear around my collar bone area. I now have to take antibiotics to get rid of it. I AM GETTING SICK AND TIRED OF THIS INFECTION CRAP!!!!! It seems like am always taking antibiotics to rid my skin of these infections.\nWhat can I do to boost my immune system? I am already up to 4 grams of Vitamin C a day (1000mg taken 4 times a day). I am so fed up with have my skin infected no matter how clean I keep it. I try putting Bactroban on the open sores when I see them but I guess there are always ones I don't see. Is there anyway I can get off this infection - antibiotic loop? My face looks awful, even I can't stand to look in the mirror that long. It looks like poison ivy but more pronounced. I went to my derm today thinking it might be an allergic reaction to the Chinese herbs but I didn't tell him I was taking them (so not to bias him at onset). He told me it was definitely NOT an allergic reaction. In fact, looking at areas other than my face he said my skin is the best he has seen it.\nI contribute that to the CHT but will not continue it until my infection disappears just to be safe. Has anyone had a severe infection outbreak when first starting to use Chinese Herbs? I just don't know why it became so erupted this time when my other infections have been more minor. I am about to give up and accept infections as just part of my life.\nI will continue to tell my experience with CHT when I begin again. For now it's like getting a fresh new coat of paint on your car only to have a bird crap all over it and have grafitti painted on as well (sorry, only example I could think of for now :) Take care everybody and thanks for hearing me whine.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Sandra Subject: Liquid softener or Dryer sheets?\nAfter my visit to the dermo, he recommended I use liquid fabric softener instead of the fabric sheets for my son. I noticed that the liquid fabric softener is \"blue\" which means it has some type of dye in it, no??\nWhat have you been using, that is, if you've been anything at all?\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Ken Subject: ARRGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\nShawn, CHT (in combination with the book Skin Deep) has given me 98% control over my eczema. I would strongly recommend that you stick with that tea... it works wonders for me.\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Shelley Subject: Mike's Questions\nMike, you asked about your eczema in genital region and stated that you do scuba diving as a hobby. My immediate thought was, perhaps the rubber wet suit is irritating your skin in the genital area. You said diving seems to be good for skin in general, which it very well may be, but different areas of our skin can react in different ways.\nIf not the wet suit, then other underwear seems like an obvious suspect. Experiment with different articles of clothing to see if you notice any change. Also, try different laundry detergent. Or could be it's not eczema, but a fungal infection. Ask a doctor for Nizoral cream, or ask a pharmacist for something comparable to try.\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Shelley Subject: New drug like Skin-Cap\nInteresting point you have there David. Perhaps a legit drug company needs to investigate the potential for a new steroid treatment that works as well as skin-cap seemed to work for many people.\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Wendy Subject: Liquid softener or Dryer sheets?\nI tried Downy Free but had to stop using even that. Now I just use Bounce Free dryer sheets and so far have not had a problem.\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Tina Subject: Liquid softener or Dryer sheets?\nWe use Bounce Free... they are dryer sheets... .\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: ARRGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\nKen, What is this book \"Skin Deep\"? Is it widely available? Also just wondering how you were told to prepare your CHT. I was told first time to let it soak in water for 15 minutes, then boil 4 \"bowls\" of water. Afterwards, let it simmer until you have one bowl of liquid left. Then for the second time I was told to just use 2 bowls, bring to a boil, then simmer down to 1 bowl. Is the same instructions you were given?\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: Liquid softener or Dryer sheets?\nI've just completely stopped using ANY fabric softner b/c it always irritated my skin. On a related note, has anyone used those \"miracle washing disks\" from Japan. Supposably, you just throw them in with the water and it work and has antibacterial properties. It makes the water \"wetter?\" to help penetrate better or something like that. Anyway, it sounded intriguing b/c there seems to be no possibility of having an allergic reaction, unlike detergent.\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Ken Subject: ARRGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\n>> What is this book \"Skin Deep\"? <<\nAssuming you have a web browser, check out \"http://grossbart.com/\". The author was nice enough to actually put up about half of the book on the web.\nMy CHT instructions are to put the \"package\" into 4 cups boiling water and let it boil for 30 minutes. Take what is left to make a serving for the morning and one for the evening.\nNOTE that your prescription most likely differs from mine, depending how you were diagnosed. [I was diagnosed with \"excess heat\". What was yours?] Also, your doctor will probably change your prescription if s/he is like mine as the body gets used to the same thing so it has to vary a bit. I was taking it twice a day until my skin cleared, now I only drink it once every couple of days.\nI've found that I can now go back to eating a fairly normal diet with only very slight effects from things that I had been pretty allergic to.\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Sue Subject: Breast feeding and eczema in your baby.\n>>The longer you breast feed the more secure your child will be as he\\she grows up and the lower the risk of developing long term allergies. My allergist has suggested as much as 1 year of breast feeding.<<\nEven if the parent who is breastfeeding *is* highly allergic, like those of us in the group? Just curious.\nDate: 28 Jul 1997 From: Robert Subject: New drug like Skin-Cap\nI agree... I continue to use SkinCap sparingly because no other external steroid I have ever tried has worked anywhere as well as skin cap. Also, internal prednisone often does not either.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Brigit Subject: SkinCap overview\nI just spoke with the original investigator of all the SkinCap testing. Here's her overview of what happened:\nThe whole thing started when a group of psoriasis patients approached Utrecht University saying, this SkinCap stuff works like a charm and that in itself we find suspicious.\nUU looked into it and discovered testing in Spain (where SkinCap comes from) had revealed corticosteroids.\nUU then tested one charge batch and found triamcinolon.\nThe importer then had a countertest performed on a later charge batch, and no triamcinolon was found.\nUU tested the same, later charge batch and found nothing either.\nThe Inspector at the Ministry for Public Health then ordered a test, and found clobetasol.\nUU will be testing for clobetasol soon.\nBTW, if it helps, then I'd say (and my spokeswoman from UU agreed) by all means use it! As long as you're aware that corticosteroids are found in some but not all batches...\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: Solved easily/Liquid softener or Dryer sheets?\nLiquid softener or Dryer sheets? This problem is VERY easy to solve. You know what to do.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Jolie Subject: To: Sandra\nSandra - I would not use either, never, ever!\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Kay Subject: Rice Dream Warning\nOur older children use Rice Dream and are content with the flavor. If you are a new mom with a nursing baby, do NOT wean in favor of Rice Dream, however. The carton clearly says it is NOT to be used as a formula substitute. It is too incomplete. Older babies with a varied diet would be OK.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Charlie Subject: ARRGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\nShawn: You were asking about boosting your immune system. I swear by ECHINACEA. I use a mix that contains all 3 parts of the plant (angustifolia, purpurea, pallida). Echinacea is generally taken for 2 weeks at a time, Follow this with a 2 week break, and the start the cycle again.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Lynn Subject: CHT & Whining\nShawn, Why don't you ask the practitioner who prescribed the Chinese Herbs if there could be a relationship between their use and infection. Some other people on this list have said they needed to switch their herb combination several times until they got it right, if I recall.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: ARGGGHH!\nShawn, have you tried Pau d'arco to lower your staph count? Hang in there, you'll get over this infection. By the way, I really appreciate your funny jokes. After all, humor is the best medicine.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: vaccinations\nSomeone mentioned that homeopathic doctors aren't keen on vaccinations. I have just read in a magazine that doctors are now thinking that tuberculosis vaccinations may be the cause of asthma and other allergies (maybe eczema too?). This made me wonder... none of my parents or grandparents had eczema, but my sister and cousin have it, as well as myself. Is eczema primarily a disorder of the 20th c.? Does anyone know of their ancestors having eczema? And were allergies so widespread way back then as they are today?\nPerhaps, in giving us vaccinations against tuberculosis, doctors screwed up our immune systems.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Mary Subject: softeners\nHello moms. Just a word to say, no fabric softeners for your kids! My roomate's mom is an allergist and she says that fabric softeners are taboo for anyone with allergies, and especially for folks with eczema. And when you do your laundry use ivory snow or make sure you rinse twice after each wash. I also like President's choice extra white - they make my clothes the softest I've ever had without softener. And don't dry your clothes hanging out in the yard. Lots of pollens get into them. yuck!\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Tara Subject: Breastfeeding and eczema\nDear Sandra, Just reading your message made me break out in a sweat. You made me relive everything I went through (multiple doctors, shelf full of creams, trepidation of using coritizones, etc) with my now 2+ year old. From my experience, YES, what you eat does affect how the baby reacts. The tricky part is that you don't know all the foods your child is allergic to. I cut out the big allergens while I was nursing (eggs, nuts, dairy, and some others), but learned later that my son was also severly allergic to barley, garlic, among other foods that I never could have pinpointed. It's a catch 22 'cause on one hand it is supposendly important to breastfeed allegy prone kids, but the foods you eat definitley do seem to affect their eczema.\nSecond, you should bathe your child at least once a day soaking in water for 20-30 minutes and then immediatly cover with Vanicream (which I've found the most effective). However, we did not gain relief from eczema until our child was 21 months at which time he was seen by a pediatric food allergist. Our visit changed our lives and for 3 months now Jeremy has been more or less itch free. The trick? we cut out ALL the foods he's allergic to from his diet, and prepare all foods for him. It comes down to not being able to trust any of the products on the market as they are often contaminated. But this is all a little premature for you, the best advice I can give you is to be extremely vigilant when introducing foods, this includes spices. one food at a time for about a week before you add anything new. If your child reacts, remove the food completely from his diet. Beware of all store bought foods. For example, graham crackers don't list dairy in their ingredients, but it is present in an ever tiny trace which will affect highly sensitive kids. You'd be surprised. My heart bleeds when I hear stories like yours 'cause it reminds me of how much I went through and I desperately do not want other parents or children to have to go through it all over again.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Richard Subject: Shawn (CHT)\nI was diagnosed with excess heat also. I dont know the ingredients as my CHT doc made the stuff up right there in her office and changed it each time I visit.\nWhen I take it, my regimen for CHT is to let the herbs soak for 30 minutes, put in 2 1/2 to 3 cups of water, bring to boil, empty, put in 1 to 2 cups of water, boil and put with other liquid. Divides into 2 drinks.\nI didn't get an infection with CHT at any time. Currently, I am not boiling tea but taking herbs in pill form. That's after about 9 months of tea. I'm no longer watching my diet, and am doing very well.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Karen Subject: E and infertility\nI'm not sure about the relationship between eczema and infertility, but if you and your wife have been trying unsuccessfully to conceive for a year or more, I encourage you to contact an infertility specialist, not a local ob/gyn or urologist who lists \"infertility\" in their yellow pages ads, but a real infertility clinic where all they do is try to help infertile couples bring healthy babies into the world.\nI haven't personally experienced eczema but my husband and I have experienced the heartbreak of infertility. And now we're raising a beautiful child who just happens to have eczema.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Karen Subject: Writing a book\nI'm writing a book for young children about having eczema, allergies, and asthma. I want to include how having these conditions makes a young child feel, physically and emotionally. I'll talk about using creams for the eczema, allergy shots, and nebulizer treatments, how it's important to do exactly as the doctor says.\nI'm writing mostly from our family's own experience, but the main character in my book is a child. I've discovered I need help in developing my main character. Since my 3-year-old is the one in our family with these problems, I need input from someone a little older on how having this condition makes them feel. Angry? Sad? I'm looking for a specific description of the itchy feeling. Also, any issues faced at school (specifically kindergarten and elementary school) when a child's eczema is in full bloom. Do other kids make fun? Tend to be afraid to touch? And how are children coping with this? Is getting rubbed down with creams and greasy ointments a drag? Do some of the skin meds make eczema sting or burn?\nIf anyone who has had eczema since childhood would be so kind as to offer input in helping me develop my young character, I would be most appreciative.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Karen Subject: Laundry softener\nI stopped using any laundry softener shortly after my daughter was diagnosed with eczema.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: Pau d'arco\nMary, Could you please tell me more about Pau d'arco? It sounds intriguing. Actually I sounds like some sort of department store fragrance! Anyway, thanks for any info you can give me.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: David Subject: Skin-Cap, Fabric Softeners\nWhat IS the truth on SkinCap, and how do we know? Actually the debate is academic for me, since the product has never been available in Britain. But it'd be nice to know, definitively. Who's kidding whom?\nAlso, there was some talk of fabric softeners. People with eczema should not use fabric softeners at all. We should use minimum quantities of non-biological washing powders/liquids (which have no enzymes and are less likely to provoke a reaction) and rinse thoroughly. Fabric softeners are superfluous chemicals. Aviod them.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Tina Subject: vaccinations\nThe Naturopath we saw Friday made the comment that the vaccines probably caused Daniel's eczema to come out especially since his eczema came out bad at about that time. But his skin looked different as soon as he was born. Then of course it got real bad at about 4 mos when he started baby foods.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Elaine Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nShawn, Sorry you're going thru a bad time. Hang in there - relief is around the corner.\nDate: 29 Jul 1997 From: Mike Subject: <No subject given>\nJust thought everyone would like to know about a word I found recently that sounds funny but describes our situations. The word is \"scurf\" as a noun or \"scurfy\" as an adjective. As a noun it describes thin dry scales detached from the epidermis esp. in an abnormal skin condition; specif: dandruff. This is from Webster's Ninth New Collegiate. The adjective is much more fun. I like to tell my wife that I'm scurfy. For some reason, just saying it makes me grin. If nothing else it gives everyone another term for describing their situation.\nDidn't see any returns on the hypnosis or subliminal suggestion question from the other day. Does any one have any reasons why I might not want to pursue such a route for controlling the need to scratch the itch?\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: Richard (CHT)\nI'm interested in the herbs in pill form. Are they just as effective? I'm sure they are much easier on the taste buds! If they work the same I would rather try them not only b/c of the taste factor but mainly b/c of how inconvient boiling the herbs are.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: thanx Elaine\nThanks Elaine. Any words of encouragement are always appreciated! The infection is getting better. My skin now looks like it has all these little bumps all over lilke it is bubbling. Still, better than having big bumps that look liked it was being boiled!\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Paulina Subject: Writing a book\nHi Karen, I've had eczema since childhood and let me tell you, it was not easy being a kid with eczema. I remember feeling very ugly because my skin was always dry, peeling and/or infected. I remember always having to answer questions about what I have and if it was contagious. I felt like a toad sometimes because some kids did not want to touch me. It was hardest when I was in kindergarten. By grade 2 or 3 though, it was not too much of an issue because all my classmates knew me by then and were used to me.\nI remember feeling left out when we had parties at school and I could not eat anything but the food item I brought. I remember tears swelling up in my eyes, the lump in my throat, and thinking why me? Why do I have to be allergic to everything? I also remember when I was about six, these older kids (about eight) made fun of me in the playground and said how disgusting my skin was. I cried. The teacher made them apologize to me and I cried again.\nI also remember feeling sorry for myself when I had to put on creams that stung. I remember hating my mom and the doctor for making me put on those creams that hurt and taking baths when I had sores and bleeding all over my skin. I remember looking forward to going home so that I could scratch until I was too tired and fell asleep. I remember waking up the next morning with my skin hurting all over.\nIn Physical Education (PE) class, I remember feeling left out because everyone wore shorts and t-shirts except me. I wore long sleeves and long pants to cover all my eczema. I remember feeling angry when I was eleven and my doctor advised my mom to not let me take PE (because the sweating was aggravating my eczema). I actually did well and enjoyed PE class and I felt like I was being punished again.\nDespite all these negative things I felt, I do have some fond childhood memories of having eczema. I remember the kindness of the many teachers and adults that made me feel special. I remember the countless hours my mom put in each day & night to try to make me happy and more comfortable. She even helped me scratch sometimes. I enjoyed those rubbed down with creams and ointments that don't hurt. I also sometimes got special dishes prepared just for me at banquets and dinners. In the summers, when it was really hot, I got to move the electric fan into my room at night. And last but not least, I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed not having to do many of the household chores that my siblings had to do (including dusting and dishwashing).\nWell, I think I've gone on long enough. I hope I am of some help to your book and I hope that your book will be of some help to a child dealing with eczema, asthma or allergies. Good luck!\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Richard Subject: Skin Cap and TNO\nStrange, strange... The importer of Skin Cap in the Netherlands confirmed early July that the TNO research they asked for did show that corticosteroids where in Skin Cap. Another strange thing is that TNO would report to Nancy's brother, since they are only informing the one who ordered the research. I will try to check this matter.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Charlie Subject: softeners\nI have to agree with you about not using fabric softener. I took it a step further switch to a product line by \"Nature Clean'. Their cleaning products list the ingredients on the boxes -- free of petroleum and animal products, dyes, phosphates, and perfumes. The stuff even cleans!!! If you can't give up your fabric softener, Nature Clean make one that gets its fragrance from lemon essential oil. Easy to find in health stores here.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Charlie Subject: Breastfeeding and eczema\nTara... Where does one get Vanicream? Do you know its ingredients? My daughter Valerie, who is 3, has horrible eczema. In my desperation to make her better, we were trying everything on her. It seemed that everything made it worse (including cortizone). For weeks now I'm hardly putting anything on her and incredibly her skin seems better.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: Chocolate!!\nWell, my eczema is stabilising. I go through good and bad patches - it's always worse on my hands though, but I guess that's not surprising.\nI'm watching my diet a bit more than I used to and eating a lot more healthily and ensuring that I drink loads of filtered water during the day and, when I feel that \"cup-of-tea-feeling\" coming on, trying to substitute it with herb teas to reduce my caffeine and tannin intake.\nHowever I was wondering about this chocolate thing. As we all seem to have admitted being total lovers of the naughty stuff, is there any way we can get round it without resorting to carob which, on its own, is a poor substitute. I was wondering whether pure chocolate - or that which is high in cocoa solids - would be ok, as it doesn't contain as much milk fat which (I assume - but don't quote me on this!) is the main allergy culprit (and also it's less fattening with a better taste)\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Angela Subject: Jordan' derm visit\nWe had to Jordan to her derm on Monday. Eczema was just creeping all over her, spreading to places it had never been before. She has an infection on her ankles and knees so she is on antibiotics. Also have aclovate cream to clear it up this time. Derm said that there could be a link between eczema and food and I told him about the peanut butter experiment. He said to take her off dairy for a couple weeks and then give her a challenge. Hope to get her cleared up of this round and then find what her trigger is.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Sara Subject: cause of eczema\nMy son is 6 and a half and he has had severe eczema for most of his life We have been to the best derms and homeopaths. The latter of which caused such a severe reaction that he ended up in hospital with septicemia. More than three months I was unable to persevere.\nI now have him on a changed diet which includes as many raw foods as I can possbly give him; foods high in fatty acids, such as nuts and cold pressed olive oil, maize (polenta); no eggs, no sugar, very little wheat and dairy; and food combining (not mixing protein and starch).\nAnd now for the first time I've not had to use cortisone creams. He does still have itchy spells at night. The WET RAG method has not worked too well and am still bathing him. Has anybody on this list had success with it? I used loads of rooibos tea, in the bath and it is as soothing as any cream. Afterwards I use the emulsifying or jojoba only. A very well known nutritional consultant says that allergies go back to high sugar intake (basically a normal western comsumption) which knocks the immune system, particularly the adrenal glands which then fail to work and produce natural cortisone. This Natural Way of eating, I'm finding is working for my son. Perhaps it'll be food for thought?\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Erik Subject: Ocean water\nI have eczema only on my hands and nowhere else. Since I've been receiving your daily updates, I have been trying to wean myself off the steroid ointments. For about ten years I've been rotating the use of Diprolene, Temovate and Psorcon (I'm currently using Ultravate) without a break in its use from week to week. Since I've been on this 'one-way' treadmill, I've become severely allergic to fish, chicken, peanuts, garlic and a host of other food products. If I eat fish, my reaction now is so severe that I either give myself a shot or get to the emergency room within a half an hour. Just ten years ago, I could eat as much fish as I wanted without any reaction. Could my overuse of steroids have caused this allergic reaction ? Neither my Derm nor my Allergist think the two are related, but what can you expect from these myopic professionals ?\nYes I do believe that the Ocean does have a healing effect on my excema too. Up until about two years for about six months out of the year I would surf at least once a week. The Ocean seems to have a drying effect and helps in stopping the oozing, helped to heal the open cracks I had in my skin. I don't feel that saltwater could ever stop the cycle, but it certainly expedited the healing.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Kim Subject: Liquid softener or Dryer sheets?\nI know softener makes thing feel better but just double rinse and call it good. We have had lots of problems even between detergents, I have not used softener in the last year and half and am sure it is for the better.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Kim Subject: Helen /Vanacreme\nHelen, I think you just made a good point. Sometimes less is better. I have been down the whole creams route and my son does best with just some natural oil. I think vanacreme (yes, a vat of it is sitting on the changing table) is just too heavy.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Tina Subject: Liquid softener or Dryer sheets?\nI posted a few days ago that I use Bounce Free in the dryer. The reason I use it is for static, not really to soften. What do you do for the static that the dryer causes?\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Suzannah Subject: Pill, and wedding update!! also Linseeds/flaxseeds - bloating\nHeather, my main source of info on the pill was a book called Nutritional Medicine, by Dr Stephen Davies & Dr Alan Stewart, published by Pan.\nPS - thanks to everyone who sent a good luck message and advice and support re my wedding and honeymoon and eating.\nAt first I was very careful about food, using steroid cream to look my best, but not eating my suspect foods. I slowly became less careful in the face of delicious temptation and exquisite foods on offer.\nI then started to worry about the steroids. So I tapered them off slowly (I used the creams on my face for about 2 weeks altogether - usually diluting them in a base of aqueous cream and applying sparingly). I am now still eating everything, but not to excess and using no steroids anywhere. I am a bit red, itchy and dry in my problem areas, but no weeping so far. Rest assured, I shall keep you posted as to my progress. I am following the naturopath storyline with interest.\nI am hoping to do something to improve digestion without needing to eliminate all nice foods!!\nThere was some discussion about problem digestive systems some weeks ago and I firmly believe this is a very likely cause for me. I have always had bloating and pain - which actually got worse after 2 months on a completely non-allergy diet.\nI then cut out LINSEEDS aka Flax seeds and that relieved a great deal of the extra bloating - so beware - I keep seeing these hailed in the press as the great new all purpose health food!!\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Kim Subject: Liquid softener or Dryer sheets?\nI take things out of the washer before they are all the way dry or hang things around the bathroom while somebody is in the shower. I usually only dry El's things and \"good\" clothes in the dryer, the rest goes out on the line.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Shawn Subject: CHT update, reoccurence of eczema\nAlright my update. First, my infection finally seems to be going away but I still feel like Quasimodo and limit my public excursions! The little bumps are calming down though. I have now been off CHT (Chinese Herbal Therapy, Zemaphyte for all you MDs) for 4 days and noticed this morning that my skin is returning to its red puffy state. So, I conclude that CHT is definitely good stuff and will start taking it again when I get some more. For those who haven't tried it yet I definitely encourage you to do so (maybe a 2 week course at first). While on it, my skin when noticeably smoother, evenly pigmented, and hardly itchy. Apparently the effects lasted for a couple days after going off it.\nNow, my question. I was told I had eczema in my infancy and childhood and then it went away. I remember in my teens I had very,very, little signs of it (maybe a FEW little bumps but I didn't notice them really). In my sophomore year of college I remember walking through the student union and constantly itching my forehead. The redness wouldn't go away after a few days and I finally got it diagnosed as eczema. I've been thinking about this a lot and since I can almost recount the exact day my eczema popped up again I thought back to my lifestyle and diet in the years preceding it. Well, I remember falling asleep w/o showering after racquetball and more importantly, eating spaghetti with tomato sauce night after night after night... . Well, my point and question is this: do you remember eating something you were apparently allergic to in your childhood in MASSIVE quantities for weeks then your eczema reappeared? I wonder if I so overwhelmed my system b/c of the tomato (and my skin by not showering the sweat off immediately, yes disgusting) that it has taken several years to recover. Can anyone remember when their eczema reoccured and your lifestyle and diet in the preceding weeks/months?\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: brac Subject: <No subject given>\nTO THE MOTHER WHO IS BREASTFEEDING... I have a seventeen year old son who has suffered with eczema since infancy. I noticed it for the first time behind my son's ear just after breastfeeding. I thought it was dried milk and tried to clean it off. It wasn't milk, of course, he was just a little \"scurfy.\" (I like that word!) We found out later that he was extremely allergic to cow's milk. When he was four months old, I dipped my finger in my glass of cool milk and put it to his lips one hot summer day. He broke out in hives all over his body from just that drop of milk, and his soft tissues swelled. A bottle of milk might have killed him. I am so glad that I breastfed my son for a long time (two and a half years). Even though he was affected by what I ate to some degree, he had the clearest skin of his life during that period. Keep breastfeeding! My son eats and drinks dairy products pretty regularly now, and even though they may still affect his skin to some degree, I don't think they are the primary source of his discomfort.\nCONCERNING SWOLLEN GLANDS... my son's glands are ALWAYS swollen. Once, when he was five years old, he contracted impetigo because of his vulnerable, open skin. A couple of other times, he looked like he might have a mild staph infection. But he has not had a huge problem with infection.\nCONCERNING SELF ESTEEM... surprisingly, my son has not suffered greatly in this department. He is well-liked by his peers, teachers, and co-workers. He was recently chosen to attend Boys' State based on his leadership qualities. He has also been nominated for Homecoming Prince, class officer, etc. He has even gone so far as to say that having eczema makes him feel unique and special, because there aren't any other kids in his school who have it. When he was younger, the boys his age thought gory looking things were cool, and he'd show off the cracked and crusty areas where his arms bend. He has been fortunate to have very little eczema on his face. He got it pretty bad on his face for the first time this winter when he wore a baseball type cap to work every day. He would go on cart runs in the parking lot when it was raining and his wet hat would stay against his skin all day. Then he didn't want to go without the hat, because the hat hid the eczema which was bad on his forehead. So the problem escalated. But during some days off, he was able to get some sun and things cleared up. Sun has always been his greatest ally. He looks great in the summertime. Sweat does cause problems, but the positive effects of the sun outweigh any sweat problems.\nWe stick to cotton clothes, short sleeved shirts, Arm and Hammer (Perfume and Dye free) laundry detergent, no fabric softeners, cotton bedding, etc. My son is a very sensitive and caring person. I don't know if this adds to his eczema (because he may carry more stress than others), or if it is a result of his eczema (giving him more compassion and concern for the feelings of others).\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Shelley Subject: vaccinations, hypnosis\nI was told by pediatrician when I was a child to make sure that I never got any vaccinations because it would be bad for my eczema. My original passport even had a document attached stating that I was not allowed to get vaccinated. This was back in the 50's/60's. I have no idea what theory it was based on but to this day I have never been vaccinated for anything.\nI tried hypnosis and it did nothing for me. That doesn't mean it wouldn't work for you. Try it and see. You have nothing to lose but your time and money...\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Pat Subject: Dermaguard\nI'm trying the sample of Dermaguard I just received and found it to be extremely drying on my skin, no hint of moisture and my skin felt like it was cracking a bit... Does anyone have experience with Dermaguard that can add advice??? You're supposed to have your skin dry and clean when you apply it, but can you add something like Eucerin after?\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Heather Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nI just went to a new allergist and he recommended a higher dose of Zyrtec at night. I was taking 5mg a day and now I am taking 10 ml. At first I was drowsy in the morning, but now I think that my body has got used to it. He also recommended Allerist which is the new and improved Seldane. He told me that many of his patients had success with Zyrtec. I have been taking it for almost a week, and the eczema is so-so. I had just gone off taking predisone for a week prior to my allergist visit. He said that if I didn't notice a difference he would give me the numbers of some dermotologists who use experimental ultraviolet light therapy like the tanning salon. I am trying a new dermo next week who is supposed to be good, I will ask them about this.\nI went to a natural food stores and bought primose oil and jojoba oil. We will see how this works? As for new creams I feel like I have experimented with everything in CVS. I just bought Alveeno cream it comes in a tub and there is a new Clinique cream with small amounts of hydrocortisone. The Clinique cream seems to be working but it is very expensive. $15 for a very small container, I only use it on my face for now.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Jolie Subject: vaccinations\nCertainly vaccinations should be questioned. The medical community has been totally brainwashed on this subject matter, we give our children vc's for diseases not seen for 20 years, why? Follow the money trail... there is big bucks in vc's. I discovered my first born had an allergic reaction to the diptheria vc. This caused chronic ear infections. Once treated she never received another ear infection. Is the medical community listening? The ped's office is 40% ear infection business but they are not asking why. It is a crime as far as I am concerned.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Chris Subject: Fabric Softer or Dryer Sheets\nTalk about deja vu! As I was doing laundry this evening I was thinking about asking what everyone uses as far as dryer sheets. I don't want static in my clothes coming out of the dryer, but I have yet to see an unscented dryer sheet. I have seen unscented fabric softener. What I have found is reusing my dryer sheets several times. It seems to help control the static, but not add so many of the chemicals that cause allergic reactions. I've found that out of all the dryer sheets I've tried, the general Lucky brand dryer sheets are the least irritating.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: Shelly/hypnosis\nI was told that one has to be susceptible to being hypnotized. I don't think I am. (I keep doubting that it will work, while the attempt is being made.) But I sorta wish I was susceptible. Maybe you can find out if one can be made to be susceptible by one's self or with help.\nDate: 30 Jul 1997 From: Howard Subject: SUN kills staph. Scrubbed nails reduce.\nSun kills a lot of bad bugs including staph. SCRUBBED fingernails reduces transmission of bugs when scratching.\nThe fingernails are the dirtiest part of the body. (Just think what your hands touch.) The fingernails of scratchers need to be kept scrupulously clean. A surgeon's stiff nailbrush should be kept at each washing area in the home and at work. Carry your own if you need to. Especially scrub before going to sleep.\nBefore you go in the sun have some calcium/magnesium and vitamins c and A in a balanced diet the day before. The whole week before would be better. It will help you relax and reduce the itching. Drink a lot of water.\nTake a coooool shower for a FEW MINUTES with NO SOAP first to increase your comfort in the sun, if you feel you need to. Or don't shower at all before. Don't allow your skin oils to be washed off. Oils allow the body to make vitamin D. Make it COOOL or cold and FAST. (2 minutes or less )\nWhen you go in the sun, stay near a cool shower. (Again make showers very fast, and only to increase comfort. The less the better during the exposure.) Don't allow yourself to burn. Take it easy. Ten minutes on your back. Ten on your tummy. Increase by 5 minutes a day. This is for noon-time sun. Earlier or later it is less effective. Get a very very light tan and try to keep it. Don't allow yourself to burn. (Don't fall asleep) Bring an alarm watch.\nSome people are bothered by the sun, but I think that is because their body is filled with allergens which are expelled as waste partly through the skin by the perspiration. That is my theory. I think these people should drink a lot of water and reduce their diet to a minimum of foods that they are sure are not allergens, and/or reduce other allergen exposure for a few days before going into the sun. Then continue to reduce their allergen exposure afterwards.\nDate: 31 Jul 1997 From: Sarah Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nHeather, As the anti-histamine I was taking wasn't working, my doctors put me on \"Zirtek\" which contains 10mg of cetrizine dihydrochloride mainly for the hayfever but also to relieve the itching caused by the eczema - is this the same thing as Zyrtek? Does it have any side affects that you know of?\nDate: 31 Jul 1997 From: Kay Subject: Limiting peer cruelty in e-kids (home education)\nI have been saddened to read the cruelty stories regarding e-children. At forty, I have realized that most cutting remarks stem from people either 1) being fearful of something they don't understand or could happen to them 2) needing to increase their self-esteem foothold by belittling others.\nI do have a practical suggestion which may help one or two of you in the future, though.\nWhy not consider home educating your children? Home schooling is legal in all fifty states. While home education is not about isolation, it CAN provide enough controlled insulation for you to shield your child from the foolishness of peer cruelty, especially in the early years. You can \"bus\" in friends who are kindhearted and sensitive to the circumstances. (Insert: children whose parents have trained them well)\nA new book entitled \"Strengths of Their Own,\" has just been published by the National Center for Home Education. It follows all kinds of meticulous evaluations which have been tracking the academic, social, and psychological prowess of America's home educated youth for the last twenty years. The results are overwhelmingly positive on ALL counts.\nAs for our family, we have been home educating now for TEN years. Our eldest graduated early at seventeen and was swooped up by Coke Corporate here in Atlanta (Fortune 500 says the #1 company in America!) two years ago at post-college pay. We were in shock; Coke does NOT routinely hire minors! He has had two promotions already and is half the age of most his co-workers. Coke is now footing the entire bill for his college degree. (Aren't we blessed!) :-)\nOur son believes home education gave him a solid academic footing (1480 on his SAT--we'll take that!), a chance to manage his own home business for four years (13-17) and learn a solid work ethic, superior curriculum, freedom to study about his faith and develop biblical wisdom, and shielding from the abject cruelty and foolishness of Generation X (of which he is demographically a part).\nLest you be extremely intimidated, I do NOT have a four-year degree, nor does my husband. A degree does not a good teacher make! (Especially when you are talking about one-on-one tutorial education such as home education.) Studies show that parents with just a high school diploma or GED often make the BEST home school instructors, for they are not so hidebound to traditional instructional methods. Neat, huh? (I do have a two-year degree, so I don't quite qualify in that statistic!)\nAt the library, look for these titles:\nTHE RIGHT CHOICE--HOMESCHOOLING by Chris Klicka\nTHE CHRISTIAN HOME SCHOOL by Gregg Harris\nSTRENGTHS of THEIR OWN by Dr. Brian Ray\nWISDOM'S WAY OF LEARNING by Marilyn Howshall\nTHE WAY HOME by Mary Pride\nDUMBING US DOWN by John Taylor Gatto\nSUCCESSFUL HOMESCHOOLING FAMILY HANDBOOK by Dr. Raymond Moore\nHOMESCHOOLING for EXCELLENCE by Colfax\nFOR THE CHILDREN's SAKE by Susan Schaeffer Macaulay\nOn the Internet, try:\n"}, {"score": 969.30695, "uuid": "f3d14652-a4d8-501c-9263-c13024d160f0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1509wb-24-28287", "target_hostname": "www.eczema.ndo.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.eczema.ndo.co.uk/log9612.htm", "page_rank": 1.2103233e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "<em>Eczema</em> Mailing List - December 1996 Archive", "snippet": "For those of you who don&#x27;t know <em>what</em> Zemaphyte <em>is</em>, just to clarify that it&#x27;s Chinese Herbal Tea in pill form and not decoction.

Their \"results showed\" that I could eat foods that had been a problem for me all my life. They also showed the opposite in shocking opposition to personal experience.\nWe were herded into a lecture room to watch/hear a slide show by the doctor, and never saw him again. The \"Doctor\" discouraged all questions at his mass lecture, and there was NO plans included for any of the \"patients\" to speak with the doctor. The \"Doctor\" said to ask the questions at the end of the lecture. I asked during the lecture but was not specific enough.\nThe results of the tests were reported to us by a lady whose credentials were not apparent. She told me of foods that I could and could not eat. There were gross inexcusable obvious errors to me in both directions.\nHow do I know the errors were gross and inexcusable? I went to the lab at about 49 years of age. I have had food/dust/mold/pollen allergies since six months of age. I almost died from asthma from a doctor that administered steroids improperly when they first came out. (This was ignorance, not deceit and I do not blame the doctor. He was in his first year of practice.) I have had skin tests for foods/allergens three times in my life and have taken desensitization shots for about 20 years. I have seen about 8 allergists in my life. I am always asking about the latnews/approaches.\nThe medical literature at the time I was considering taking the tests said that these lab tresults were not reproducible. My mother and aunt put a lot of pressure on me to go to get the blood tests. I could not convince them, even after showing them an article from NewsWeek about the invalidity of the tests. They still clung to the idea that the blood tests were some kind of cure for me. The fact that they were only a tdid not penetrate. I knew what my major food allergies were. I had learned the hard way.\nMy Mom had suffered with me for sooo many years. I could go into gory details. Suffice it to say there were daily sheets to wash and hospitalizations. Yet she refused the very traditional approach to food allergies, an elimination diet. If I had done so as a kid it would have saved my whole family a lot of agony. Only as an adult of 35 did I do an elimination diet when I was on my own far from home. I learned of a lot more foods that I am allergic to. In childhood I had eaten so many and so much of them every day that I didn't know which food was affecting me to what degree. I tore myself apart with scratching. Now I am comparatively good. I cannot attribute much improvement to anything but the elimination diet, nutrient supplements, and avoidance of allergens. Sad to say.\nI still have hopes though, and continue to look for alternative therapies.\nWhat else can I say to convince you? Probably nothing. I recommend you ask, as many questions as you have, and get definite written answers. You will probably have to write them.\nDate: 1 Dec 1996 19:14:12 From: Steve Subject: ice stops itching/ rotating meds\nHow is evaporation different, in effect, from using ice cubes held by a washcloth? Ice almost immediately stops itching and the melting cool water mildly cleanses the skin of possible irritants that may be contributing to the itching. This prevents scratching which allows healing to occur, thus contributing to the breaking the itch/scratch/medicate cycle.\nUse in conjunction with an medicated ointment that you know you are not allergic to. Don't assume you will remain non-allergic to any ointment/cream you use. Eventually it may do more harm than good, even though it started out as a miracle cure. Rotating medications is a normal need for some allergic people.\nDate: 2 Dec 1996 06:52:27 From: Christine Subject: Evaporation vs. Ice In Cloth\nEvaporation is the conversion of water into vapor. That's the difference.\nNight before last I woke up in the middle of the night because my back was hot, sweaty and really itchy with raised rashy patches. I got a pillow case, wet it in warm water, squeezed out the water, took it to my bed, laid down on my stomach, put the pillow case on my back, covered up with my blanket, the itch went away after a couple of minutes, I slept well, I woke up, and the inflammation had subsided. This is a pattern. This routine has become dependable in my life. Ice never did that for me.\nDate: 2 Dec 1996 10:13:21 From: Ann Subject: allergy shots\nAllergy shots appear to have helped my skin dramatically. At first, I got worse and it took over a year (of going for shots once or twice a week) to see any improvement. So this is not for those expecting a quick fix. Many doctors once believed that pollen and dust did not contribute to eczema; hence the myth developed that allergy shots don't work for eczema. THEY DO WORK- IF YOU ARE POLLEN AND DUST SENSITIVE! Don't expect a complete cure, particularly if you have other allergies (i. e. foods). And be prepared for an initial rough period.\nDate: 2 Dec 1996 21:55:17 From: Sherry Subject: treatments\nI just find that no matter how many derms. I go to, they always put you on cortisone cream. Nothing else ever comes up. Any idea why their field of treatment is so narrow?\nDate: 3 Dec 1996 05:20:21 From: Brigit Subject: Sherry-- doctor's one-track mind\nSherry, surely that's a bit unfair...?\nThe last dermatologist I went to see mapped out a regime of Betadine scrub, bath oil and thorough greasing up, as I've described before. Reading through the archives I find that others on this List report about having things prescribed other than cortisone, too.\nI think it's just that cortisone is the only thing that really helps, at least temporarily, whether we (and the doctors) like it or not!\nDate: 3 Dec 1996 07:08:45 From: Sherry Subject: Sherry-- doctor's one-track mind\nI certainly don't want to start a fight over cortisone creams. I should say in my personal experience I have only been shown one path for my troubles.I am glad that others have found doctors who were open to other avenues and looked at the long range problems of certain products over time. Hats of to all doctors and patients that have had good results with whatever.\nDate: 3 Dec 1996 14:00:05 From: Rita Subject: Zemaphyte\nI have received a response from the Chief Operating Officer from Phytopharm Ltd. that \"Zemaphyte is being developed as a prescription medicine, and as such will only be available in Canada after the product has been registered. We are in the process of collecting the necessary clinical work to achieve registration of the product, but do not anticipate having a registration into Canada in the near future...\".\nFor those of you who don't know what Zemaphyte is, just to clarify that it's Chinese Herbal Tea in pill form and not decoction. Info on Zemaphyte has been posted on the list in the past.\nDate: 3 Dec 1996 19:33:22 From: Ken Subject: eczema vs. psoriasis\nCan anyone tell me what the differences between eczema and psoriasis are? I've read the descriptions of both under http://tray.dermatology.uiowa.edu/PIPs but there seems to be an overlap in descriptions.\nThe reason I ask is that my eczema seems to have changed (at least for the latcouple of flareups) from relatively flat and reddish itchy spots that turn dark and remain for a while before they go away to a bumpier condition that widens and the scales are thicker. Right now I have this condition on my forehead and on the sides of my face along with spots on other parts of my body.\nPerhaps I have psoriasis as well as eczema?\nDate: 4 Dec 1996 06:01:45 From: Christine Subject: PSORIASIS\nFrom http://www.hkma.com.hk/std/psorias.htm:\nPsoriasis is a chronic erythemato-squamous condition characterized by sharply circumscribed salmon pink patches, plaques covered with silvery scales. The most useful form to confirm the diagnosis is to use the wooden spatula to scrape the surface of the suspected lesion, profuse silvery scaling can easily be generated.\nDate: 5 Dec 1996 18:23:39 From: Gary Subject: doctors\nAs I've written here before, I saw a dozen dermatologists over the course of ten years all of whom wanted me to use industrial strength steroid ointments every day all over my body. I asked each one if there would be long term harm from such a regime. None indicated that there would be any significant problems. Then my skin changed as a result of the steroids: I have thinning in a few places and it takes me forever (seems like) to heal when I get a bruise or cut. God knows how much damage I may have incurred internally or if I will get cataracts in later years (granted, this is rare).\nMiraculously I have now found a doctor who is willing to work with me. We have devised a regime of lotions ranging from no steroid to moderate steroid intensity that I alternate everyday depending on how bad (or good) I am. He says my thinning skin could return to normal in a few years.\nLesson learned: I used to think that you couldn't really trust a general practitioner to treat most ailments; now I believe you can't even trust most specialists to treat ailments within their specialty. If you truly want quality care, it seems you have to seek out the bdoctors in the country or in the world. Also, you have to educate yourself (and treat yourself if necessary) as much as possible.\nDate: 6 Dec 1996 12:00:37 From: Shelley Subject: Goodbye Soap\nCetaphil is what I use when my skin cannot tolerate soap. It is a liquid lotion that can be used with or without water. You can smear it on and just wipe it off with a cloth, or you can use it like soap and wash it off with water. I use it when my skin is totally raw. It can be bought OTC but is not cheap. I pay $12 for a 16-oz bottle. It is made by Owen/Galderma in San Antonio, Texas.\nDate: 6 Dec 1996 20:56:25 From: Steve Subject: Peter/MoldSprayWorks? Allergy Catalog list?\nPeter wrote: >> I just saw a spray product in an allergy catalogue that presumably stops and prevents mold growth in car air systems. Anyone have any experiences with such a product? <<\nI am interested in knowing more too. I wonder if it really works! My allergist said that vinegar kills mold, but I don't know how one would use vinegar in a car air-conditioning system.\nDate: 6 Dec 1996 22:27:47 From: Edward Subject: allergy to shoes and clothing\nI don't personally have the shoe problem (rubber glues), the sock problem (elastic), or the undergarment problem (elastic). But I can point you in a few directions that may help. I assume from this post that your son may be latex allergic, either type 1 or type 4 or both, and also has an allergy to formaldehyde. I assume you have seen an allergist or dermatologist, and he has been tested.\nFor socks without elastic, my information suggests calling The Vermont Country Store, 802-362\nYou can visit the ELASTIC Website, at http://www.latexallergyhelp.com - you can then click to reach a sub-page that discusses products that contain natural rubber latex. You will want to look for the list that contains information about products found in the home.\nYou can purchase neoprene elastic (synthetic elastic - no natural rubber latex) if you wish to do your own sewing. Nicci Paris runs what she calls \"The Alternative Resource Catalog,\" and she sells this. Phone 708-503 or maybe 800-618. But before you use neoprene elastic you need to know what you are doing - it will be an appropriate solution for a type 1 latex allergy, but may not work for type 4 rubber allergy. You may need to ask his allergist about this. I do not know if neoprene elastic contains formaldehyde.\nDate: 6 Dec 1996 23:55:08 From: Julie Subject: Goodbye Soap; Good Riddance.\nOhmigosh! I hadn't heard that Ivory soap is connected to finger tip eczema problems. I had just started to use contacts, and my eye doctor had told me that using Dove soap leaves a residue on contacts. He suggested that I use Ivory, just to wash my hands before using my contacts. Since then, my fingertips have broken out and I lost the finger nail on my right ring finger... twice! Until now, I haven't made the connection to the Ivory soap. I had never had problems losing finger nails before those episodes.\nEureka! Uh oh, now what do I wash my hands with before applying my contact lenses?????\nDate: 7 Dec 1996 05:22:35 From: Patsy Subject: Contact Lens and Soap\nI wear contacts. Before inserting them, I wash my hands in an antibacterial soap. Afterwards, I apply lotion or cream. I've never had problems with either the contacts or fingertips.\nDate: 7 Dec 1996 05:53:19 From: Christine Subject: Soap\nRemember I said that Ivory gave me fingertip eczema and that after I quit using it, my fingertip eczema cleared up? Well, don't be fooled by Ivory's pureness, \"it's one of the most drying soaps.\" That quote came from a dermatologist. No wonder it made my skin crack open. A friend of mine shared my same experience.\nDate: 7 Dec 1996 12:53:19 From: Patsy Subject: Contact Lens and Soap\nAny anti-bacterial soap - Dial, Irish Spring, store brand - etc works fine. I just wash my hands thorougly, then after I'm through doing contact lens stuff, I apply my regular lotion or cream. I think you'd be wise to look on the label of whatever hand soap you use and make sure it doesn't have creams or lotions in it.\nI have eczema on my hands, but have never had fingertip eczema. And, my dear, I've been wearing contacts since before the Dead Sea got sick.\nDate: 8 Dec 1996 05:21:53 From: Christine Subject: FYI & Miscellaneous\nMy latimprovement: Since I quit using soap, I have cuticles again. I hadn't seen my cuticles in a long, long time. My fingernail even grew back after it was half way gone for a couple of years, and the deep ridges smoothed over.\nDate: 9 Dec 1996 09:51:05 From: Martin Subject: New subscriber\nI've had eczema since birth. I also suffer from asthma. I hear that these two diseases often go together. Growing up, my eczema was pretty bad, covering most of my body. My skin would bleed if I would scratch it. I tried every type of medication that my doctor would recommend. The skin creams would usually have a temporary affect. My skin would improve for about a week then my skin would break out again.\nI also tried ultra violet radiation. That helped a bit. About 5 years ago, my mom suggested that I try acupuncture. I agreed because nothing else worked. The first thing that the acupuncture lady did was put me on a diet. She told me to avoid milk, eggs, red meat, wheat, tomatoes, and fish. Within about a month, my skin improved so much. The rashes that covered my body disappeared. This is amazing since the condition of my skin was so bad. Since then, I've rarely had any break-outs on my body. I do occasionally have problems with red patches on my cheeks and forehead. But on the whole, my eczema is pretty much under control.\nDate: 9 Dec 1996 10:08:18 From: Ann Subject: vaseline\nVaseline (petroleum jelly) is probably NOT good for one's health from a chemical sense. In fact, my allergist strongly recommended that I switch to Crisco or some edible oil to avoid the toxicity and inpurities of vaseline. But for me, the more wholesome alternatives just aren't heavy enough.\nI need something to really seal the skin off; I crack more and seem to be much more powdery with out the vaseline. So I go with vaseline figuring that the dryer skin that comes with other moisturizers leads me to more infection and antibiotics and more steroids, none of which are healthy. I have never noticed that vaseline caused more eczema, but greasy skin often looks redder because of the shine.\nDate: 9 Dec 1996 11:43:18 From: Patsy Subject: vaseline\nAgain, creamy petroleum jelly has been a lifesaver for me. When I wake up itching in the middle of the night, I reach for my jar at bedside, apply a coat, and I'm able to get back to sleep. I'm afraid I'd have trouble with using Crisco - would someone mistake me for a Caesar Salad?\nDate: 9 Dec 1996 11:48:50 From: Christine Subject: White Petrolatum Addendum\nRemember I said my cuticles were growing back since I stopped using soap, well they are continuing to grow. Yep. You know that the cuticle is the root of the fingernail. When eczema eats away the cuticle, it can impair the growth of the fingernail. My Dr. said my fingernail would grow back as soon as my cuticles did. Somehow I didn't believe it was going to happen. I'm glad it didn't do permanent damage; miraculous how our bodies mend themselves when we quit abusing them.\nDate: 9 Dec 1996 11:58:56 From: Ralph Subject: White Petrolatum (Vaseline)\nMy personal experience with petrolatum is that it is okay and useful in small quantities and not used for more than two or three days, but is irritating when used in larger quantities (a thick coating) or for more than a few days in a row.\nBecause petroleum jelly excludes air and water, it can cause irritation with heavy or long-term use.\nAquaphor, a product recommended by Shelley, has proved to be a superior emollient in my experience, but the same precautions still apply: use it sparingly, and not every day.\nDate: 9 Dec 1996 16:43:04 From: Fayez Subject: vaseline\nI have been using Vaseline (not the less greasy kind) and it has done wonders for me. I use it after I shower. And every time my hands look dry.\nIt and basic oils (olive and vegeatable cooking oil) are the only things that keep my skin mosturized. I have been using it religiously for about a year, and I am starting to finally see some healing of the skin on my hands.\nDate: 9 Dec 1996 17:41:54 From: Kelly Subject: Crisco\nI believe Christine was referring to the solid Crisco which doctors have recommended for many, many years.\nDate: 9 Dec 1996 20:11:13 From: Steve Subject: White Petrolatum (Vaseline)\nAny lubricant has to be applied with some degree of restraint. Too much and the oil or whatever will encourage the growth of fungus (white spots). The skin needs time to itself for a while. I am not sure how long. Perhaps once a day every other day or so?\nDate: 10 Dec 1996 06:22:45 From: Brigit Subject: Petrolatum, oil, acrylics\nHere's my comments on the petrolatum and (of course, again!) vegetable oil threads:\nVaseline, petroleum jelly, petrolatum: it's made from crude oil, the stuff that the Gulf War was fought over. It's a *mineral* oil, which will *not* be absorbed by the skin (but may of course very well irritate it). It's really as simple as this: mineral oils are not absorbed by the skin; vegetable and animal oils are. So, you may use a mineral oil based product for shielding off, but only vegetable (or animal) oil will moisturise.\nFor moisturising, you cannot use any *pure* oil, you need an emulsion of oil in water (OiW) or water in oil (WiO). This is because the natural lipid layer of your skin is itself an emulsion, which cannot accept significant quantities of additional oil. Water and oil simply do not mix; that's why you need an emulsifier in every moisturising skin product.\nPure oil that is applied topically may sometimes help: for example, pure borage oil is good for many types of eczema. However, it still does not moisturise; think of it as an agent carrying goodies (in the case of borage oil, gamma linolenic acids).\nIrritants. It can hardly be stressed enough that any list of irritants is statistics-based only. Top of the list will be what irritates most people; bottom of the list that which irritates only a minority. However, everbody is different and what is an irritant to one person need not be that to another. Avoiding all known irritants regardless of whether it's an irritant to *you* is folly. If I, for example, were to avoid lanolin because many others react adversely to it, then my eczema would be a *lot* worse; and so would it be if I allowed lecithin near my skin, which is a well-known skin healing agent!\nLong Chemical Names Do Not A Toxin Make. Everything has a complicated-sounding chemical name, including air and water. My sister once told me in horror that something she'd bought contained ascorbic acid, she was very much taken aback on learning that this was vitamin C.\nDate: 10 Dec 1996 09:50:49 From: Diane Subject: Glaxal base\nWith everyone talking about petroleum jelly, I was wondering if I am the only one who uses Glaxal base as a moisturizer? Sure it is greasy, but it certainly works for me, and contains no lanolin. I also use Vaseline sometimes, and that works great too.\nDate: 10 Dec 1996 09:53:58 From: Bradley Subject: Anyone with Nummular eczema?\nJust wondering if any of you are afflicted with the nummular type of eczema. I often wonder if that's really what I have because every description of it I can find always describes one of the characteristics as \"itchy\" or \"weeping.\" Dry and with circular (sort of) scales bdescribes mine, though they definately are coin-shaped; they have never itched and eventually disappear only to leave a darkened spot (which also fades away after several months). Alas: new ones pop up here and there just as fast as they disappear.\nRight now I would say I have 12-15 scattered about me (arms, legs, torso) that are slightly smaller than a dime. I am particularly interested in this: why did it choose this particular form?? I am impressed with the amount of research you have all undertaken in an attempt to control things yourselves. I hope I can contribute in some way. Just Sunday I purchased Neutrogena Emulsion (mainly glycerin) and used it in moderate amounts once a day. My skin feels as soft as it did 2 years ago, though no discernable effect on the spots. Also: antibiotics (kephlexen, I believe) completely do away with the spots (and my dandruff and itch scalp), but it certainly makes one whistle! In this repect, at least, it is better to smell good than look good :-)\nDate: 10 Dec 1996 15:59:33 From: Rebecca Subject: Vaseline\nI use a lotion called \"Vaseline Intensive Care\". It has a cooling and soothing effect when my eczema is bad, and I have never had a bad reaction from it.\nDate: 10 Dec 1996 19:55:33 From: Steve Subject: MINERAL? OIL. Vaseline, vitamins\nIs there such a thing as \"mineral\" oil? Don't all oils that are pumped out of the earth come from plants and animals of eons ago? When I put Vaseline on my skin, it seems to absorb. It will disappear after a while. Where does it go? Of course if you put gobs of it on, it won't.\nAre we talking facts here? Let's say the Vaseline is NOT absorbed. Doesn't it provide a coating that holds in the moisture that the body has? And is your skin really dry? It may not be dry at all. Much of the flaking of eczema is the damaged skin flaking off just as a sunburn eventually causes your skin to peal. Much can be removed with cold water and an electric razor. Really, ladies! Buy an electric razor for your flaking skin. But don't rub your skin with it. Go lightly. And go lightly with the oils too. They may cause problems even if you are not allergic to them. Too much promotes fungal growth..\nTruly dry skin can be treated with B vitamins or foods containing them. Taken properly they can stimulate the oil glands to work. Unless he oil is produced internally we are just patching.\nDate: 10 Dec 1996 20:56:01 From: Ann Subject: scalp eczema\nI always have scalp eczema ranging from just heavy flaking to painful burning cracks. I also get lots of sores there which feel much bigger and worse than they actually are; I think this is because the scalp has so many nerve endings. My scalp is RELATIVELY easy to deal with as my hair is very thin; but even for me it is difficult to get the ointments on exactly the right spots.\nI think scalp eczema is one of the worst areas to have. T gel shampoo helps with flaking, but it does nothing for the inflammation and broken skin and possibly makes it worse. Some of my scalp spots have been steadily inflamed for the past 13 years! Scalp eczema has kept me away from hair salons. I have had exactly 3 professional hair cuts in the past 35 or 40 years! I cut it as bI can myself because of fear of infection. We eczema people do not lead normal lives, do we?\nDate: 10 Dec 1996 22:12:16 From: Gayle Subject: eczema and shoes and clothing\nI have found that I cannot tolerate any shoes with that foam rubber lining. I use all leather on the inside. Moccasins work nice. Instead of tennis shoes, try hiking shoes (from a camping outfitter). They may be synthetic but you can get those with breathable fabrics- I can wear those.\nDate: 10 Dec 1996 22:21:14 From: Gayle Subject: Goodbye Soap; Good Riddance.\nI find that if I use a detergent rather than a soap, I do not have problems. I cannot tolerate any soaps. Zis a detergent that I use with no problem. I don't use contacts so I don't know about if it affects them. Zrinses off (your skin) better than soaps do.\nDate: 11 Dec 1996 06:01:36 From: Brigit Subject: *MINERAL* oils?\nSteve, I was talking elementary facts that may be confirmed by going to an academic bookshop and picking up any serious book on the subject. The black goo that oozes out of the desert is *chemically* different from the organic stuff it was produced from.\nFrom this crude oil many products are made, including mineral oil (aka petrolatum) and most plastics (which bear no chemical resemblance to organic materials either).\nYes, Vaseline \"shields\" (as I phrased it), which equals to saying it \"provides a coating\" (as you phrased it). But it won't moisturise your skin; it smoothens the top layer of dead skin cells in much the same way that rubbing it onto leather smoothens the leather.\nDate: 11 Dec 1996 06:57:09 From: Steve Subject: Fingernails/Ivory/Zest\nIvory vs Zon fingernails: I have the opposite experience with these two. I scrub my nails vigorously (30 or 40 strokes) with a very stiff nail brush and ivory soap and my fingernails are getting better and better. A very dramatic improvement. I thoroughly rinse while continuing to scrub. I do this before and after washing dishes and before and after showering. My nails are short and I use nothing to push back cuticles. I am told that doing so causes major problem. My nails look great now.\nThere may be other factors playing here.\nDate: 11 Dec 1996 09:01:04 From: Kelly Subject: Supplements\nJust some thoughts on supplementations for us with eczema after Steve bringing up the Vit. B's.\nGLA - A simple tto tell if you're deficient. Pinch the skin on the back of your hand, then release it, if it lays flat immediately, you're fine but if holds any form (for any amount of time), you definitely need supplementation.\nBeta-carotene - not Vit. A, A is toxic in high dosages. Try starting at 50,000 IU (25,000 IU = 15 mg.) increasing by 25,000 but not to exceed 100,000. If your skin takes on a yellow-orange tone, your body is completely saturated with beta and you need to lower the dosage, should this happen, you are in no danger, just reduce.\nZinc - Most people don't realize that zinc should be taken on a empty stomach, your body absorbs very, very little when taken with food. Try zinc supplementation starting at 30 mg. and not to exceed 100 mg. Zinc is used in high dosages to induce vomiting, higher than I suggbut if you should feel nauseated, reduce.\nAll 3 of these are highly proven supplementations for eczema. With beta and zinc you will almost immediately notice a speed in healing for non-eczema wounds. Give all supplementations at the very least 1 month to kick in and don't overlap INTRODUCTION of supplementations, put some time in between them, so you can see what works for you and how much.\nWith single supplementation, you MUST take a decent multiple vitamin & mineral (no grocery store crap) or don't even bother trying this, it's not worth it, you still would notice improvement but not the kind of results you would get if you were doing this properly.\nDate: 11 Dec 1996 10:14:36 From: Ann Subject: scalp eczema- Steve\nThanks for the suggestion about Ionil. The active ingredients are the same as in Tgel. Tgel works great on the flaking. The problem is that the sores, cracks and open skin don't respond well to any thing except steroids and vaseline.\nDate: 11 Dec 1996 13:52:01 From: Sherry Subject: Skin Cap\nI have been using a product called Skin Cap for about a week. I must say that my eczema as well as the itch is much better. The nozzle broke off so I returned it for a new one. I also think that the creamy petroleum jelly and ITCH-X also helped so that when I actually started using Skin Cap, my condition was much better.\nI should tell you that the can was $40.00. I was ready to do anything to get rid of this itch and the rash. For those of you who don't know me, I spend a good amount of time and money worrying about wrinkles, rashes, and if my pocketbooks match. You know the type, right? Anyway, I used it on my face too. I can't promise that it will work for everyone, but I am pleased with it. Now the big debate, do I buy more wrinkle creams, pocketbooks, or Skin Cap cans. A special thank you to all of you for giving me a variety of methods to try!\nDate: 11 Dec 1996 14:32:19 From: Rebecca Subject: Scalp eczema and hairdressers\nAnn, I felt exactly the same way as you do about hairdressers. However I went to one recently, and I admit I was incredibly nervous and lowered my voice as I said \"I have eczema on my head, is that ok?\" She was wonderful and she was the one who showed me how to *massage* my scalp to promote the blood circulation there, and recommended olive oil applied and left overnight on the scalp (I have not tried this yet).\nPeople who are trained properly as hairdressers should know all about the different infections that people can get on their heads, and to be honI imagine that if you find a good one (and by that I don't mean a more expensive one necessarily) they will be more sympathetic than you imagine. They also sterilise their equipment so there is no fear of infection.\nPS I did try T-Gel, and for me it made the itching a lot worse too.\nDate: 11 Dec 1996 15:36:34 From: Ann Subject: scalp eczema\nI tried a liquid form of steroids on my scalp (I think it was called textacort) but it was much too drying (it was alcohol based). So the derm dr. told me to just use the regular ointments. He implied that the liquid forms were developed so the hair doesn't get greasy. I don't care about that as my hair is already fully saturated with grease from the ointments on my neck face and hands! BTW, I had trouble getting the liquid stuff on the right spots too.\nDate: 11 Dec 1996 17:04:07 From: Patsy Subject: Supplements\nLet me add this note to Kel's discussion of vitamin supplements. She made the point that one should be able to tell a deficiency in GLA by pinching the skin on the back of the hand and seeing how rapidly it returns to normal. Please bear in mind that as we age, our skin loses elasticity, and will therefore not go back down as quickly. Is there another tfor GLA deficiency?\nDate: 11 Dec 1996 20:48:02 From: Man Subject: Glaxal base\nI use Glaxal Base and have for a few years. I find it has less of a \"grease\" factor than vaseline and seems to do a fine job for me. Actually, many of the topical steroid mixtures that I have gotten at pharmacies use Glaxal Base as the base substance because of its moisturizing qualities (or so I've been told). I also use Petroleum Jelly during flare-ups and find that you need to really clean your skin to avoid blocked pores (?..small red pimple-like eruptions). I haven't tried the \"creamy\" variety as yet as recommended by Brad (I think).\nDate: 11 Dec 1996 20:49:40 From: Steve Subject: Ann/*TREATMENT BLAST*\nAnn, I'm glad you answered. Try using *ALL* of the above. One of the shampoos has a tar derivitive, an old classic remedy that is used effectively by many traditional dermatologists.\nGive yourself a *TREATMENT BLAST*. I mean do everything that helps for several days in a row maybe up to two weeks or three weeks, like *even* the Terrible Steroids just for a few days... but taper off slowly. Vitamins take about two weeks for hard cases to show some relief. Take one multivitamin in the morning and one at lunch with food. Don't take the multivitamin at night. I think they may keep you up. Two per day is ok according to my doctor and two pharmacists I checked with.\nConcentrate on the vitamin C because it really helps the itching. You can take it at night with calcium/magnesium tablets and you will be more relaxed and comfortable. If you want more information the cal/mag I can send you a few paragraphs. The C will help the asorption of the cal/mag.\nGet some sun on your scalp. If only a little to start with. Several doctors recommend it. It kills lotsa bacteria... like staph infections and the vitamin D you get from it helps the cal/mag absorption. If you heal up enough so that there are no openings, get some sea water on you, if possible. It's amazing what a swim at a clean beach can do for the skin and the spirits, especially if your swim.\nDo the shampoos with Tar. Do the vaseline, but wash it off every night and sleep with nothing on your scalp. Give it a chance to \"breathe\" so to speak. In the morning put on the Vaseline.\nTry \"Head and Shoulders\"? There have been several reports that it cleared up cradle cap in just two uses. Of course I don't know what the heck cradle cap is. But it might help. I have not tried it. After your scalp is calmed down keep on doing everything except the steroids. And consider the cause. Do you have some suspects that could be the culprits? If the vitamins help, the cause may have been a minor nutritional need. If not... what else?\nDate: 11 Dec 1996 23:59:13 From: Ken Subject: evaporation question: sweat okay?\nI like to run/jog about 3 to 4 times a week and usually stretch for about 20 minutes afterward. I perspire well, so after a (good) run, my t-shirt is about a half to three quarters sweated out. It occurred to me after reading the thread on evaporation that maybe \"evaporation is evaporation\" so keeping the soaked tshirt on while I stretch might actually be a *good* thing. I tried that today (instead of my usual habit of immediately towelling off and changing into another tshirt) and amazingly, it seemed more soothing than irritating (like I had assumed). Slightly gross sounding, but any thoughts?\nDate: 12 Dec 1996 07:21:22 UT From: Susan Subject: Allergy to the Sun?\nOne thing I'm prone to in the sun are hives. Ever since I was little, I experience itchy hives after initial exposure to strong sunlight. On my vacation I'll be equipped with level 30 sunscreen (no frangrances or PABA, to which I am allergic), but I can't say that I ever noticed that sunscreen has ever helped in the past. I don't think sun screen causes the hives because I get the hives even if I don't have anything on my skin.\nI was wondering if anyone else is prone to solar uticaria? If so, can you suggany herbal or medical remedies?\nDate: 12 Dec 1996 08:52:33 From: Kelly Subject: Goodbye Soap; Good Riddance.\nFrom my understanding of Ivory, we shouldn't use it. As long as I can remember, every doctor has told me to stay away from Ivory, never heard one suggI use it. Don't know why, this started back when I was little and back then I wasn't asking questions.\nDate: 12 Dec 1996 09:11:25 From: Kelly Subject: scalp eczema\nAnn, True, alcohol-based liquids are very drying. You say you had trouble getting the liquid stuff on the right spots too. Didn't it come with a nozzle?\nI don't know the reason behind why it is alcohol based but I do know the scalp eczema is highly bateria based so to control it you need something to kill it, that's why I don't mind the alcohol and drying is a problem, I apply lotion with an old solution bottle. My hair is thick, so just getting through the hair to the sore with ointment isn't realistic for me, it would come off on the hair I was passing by to get to the spot.\nSo what do you use for disinfectant on your scalp?\nDate: 12 Dec 1996 09:32:21 From: Kelly Subject: Fingernails/Ivory/Zest\nSteve, It's apparent you are not doing all this scrubbing for your eczema condition, so your Ivory statement doesn't apply here unless you do use in an area that does have eczema. No one with eczema could withstand vigorous scrubbing, especially with a stiff nail brush. You might want to see someone to get this properly diagnosed.\nPushing back a cuticle is much less damaging than your scrubbing. The scrubbing is more apt to cause major problems, with or without having eczema.\nDate: 12 Dec 1996 10:13:07 From: Kelly Subject: Ann/*TREATMENT BLAST*\nSteve wrote: >> Take one multivitamin in the morning and one at lunch with food. Don't take the multivitamin at night.<<\nSorry but I have to disagree, you need more time in between the 2 supplements. If you take one in the morning and then at lunch, your body doesn't have time to use the morning supplement so when you take the one at lunch, your body won't need it and it will be expelled/wasted.\nTake 1 with breakfast and 1 with dinner but always with food.\nVitamin C helps the itching because it's a natural antihistamine. Calcium and magnesium work together but it's the mag that is the muscle relaxer. Some calcium supplements come with added vit. D, if you are taking 2 multi's a day, don't use an added D cal supplement because the multi usually contains 400 IU and you shouldn't take more then 800 IU total for the day. Vit. D actually isn't a vitamin, it's a hormone that is EXTREMELY dangerous in high dosages. Don't play with this one.\nFor assimilation of calcium, you need: Iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, vit. A, C, D and F. For assimilation of Magnesium, you need: Calcium, phosphorus, potassium, vit. B6, C and D. So always take at least 1 good multi daily when you are trying single supplements.\nDate: 12 Dec 1996 10:51:34 From: Ann Subject: no experiment is a failure\nKen, I experience the same phenomenon from sweat. Whenever it is real hot (like 90+) all day for several days, my skin clears almost completely. My theory is that the constant sweating keeps the skin moist at all times (as in a 24 hour wet wrap). My allergist says it's more likely that with weather like that there is no wind, so pollen levels drop; but I think the sweat plays a role. For me, sweating heavily for an hour or so during exercise doesn't have the same effect; I need a longer period of time. CAUTION TO OTHERS: some eczema patients are irritated by their own sweat; so be careful!\nDate: 12 Dec 1996 22:45:43 From: Edward Subject: mice\nMy problem has to do with the mousepad, but the cause is my rubber allergy. The underside of your mousepad (unless you have a trackball) is made of rubber, and I am definitely allergic to it. I realized a few months ago that if the base of my hand contacts the rubber underside of the mousepad, then I will have my typical delayed hypersensitivity reaction (small tense blisters called vesicles) at that exact location when I wake up the next morning.\nHere is one solution to this problem: I bought a wrist support covered with fabric (these are sold at computer stores as ergonomic aids. They attach with a velcro strip to the base of the mousepad, and are designed to reduce wrist fatigue, but I use it to avoid contact with the rubber). Also, the little ball inside your mouse is rubber - I thought that this might possibly leave a bit of \"rubber residue\" on the top of the mousepad, so I wear thin 100% cotton gloves every time I use my computer.\nDate: 12 Dec 1996 18:16:53 From: Sherry Subject: evaporation question: sweat okay?\nI too run on a treadmill at a Gym when I have time. When I start to sweat, I start to itch like crazy. I then run home as fast as I can and shower. I guess we're all different.\nDate: 13 Dec 1996 05:13:47 From: Brigit Subject: Ken- new formula\nIf your eczema pesters you not too badly you might try a sort of patch tfor new lotions and potions: place a drop of the suspected substance on a soft bit of skin (the inside of your elbow is often recommended), cover with a sealing-off sticky plaster (Band Aid) and leave alone until your next shower, at least overnight but preferably 24 hours.\nThen (before showering, obviously) remove the plaster and check for any sign of irritation.\nDate: 13 Dec 1996 06:21:22 From: Steve Subject: Scrubbing Fingernails/Ivory/Zest\nKel, you wrote that \"the scrubbing is more apt to cause major problems\"; I disagree. My experience tells me the opposite. My nails are continuing to improve dramatically. My cuticles are smooth and beautiful. They look great.\nPushing back cuticals is dangerous. It damages the seal the cuticle forms and allows the introduction of bacteria where the pushing is done.\nI am not relating any of this to eczema.\nDate: 13 Dec 1996 10:18:31 From: Ann Subject: scalp\nKelly, I disinfect my scalp with polysporin ointment which is what I use everywhere else. Cleosin-T was prescribed for my scalp, but I found it to be too drying.\nDate: 13 Dec 1996 15:23:40 GMT From: David Subject: mice\nAs a heavy computer user I can suggtwo soloutions to problems with rubber and mice:\nUse a piece of rough cardboard instead of the rubber mouse mats; the type you get on the back of pads of paper work quite well.\nGet an optical mouse; they can be had for about GBP30; they are based on a special mat which has a special printed pattern on it and a pair of sensors in the mouse. The mouse has no ball and the mat usually no rubber.\nThis rubber discussion has just made me think about something quite important. I think I am allergic to rubber (my lips swell if I blow a balloon up but I've not noticed problems with rubber bands etc.) but I've always used a latex mattress and pillows because of its potential benefits for my asthma over things with feathers in - now I wonder if that is doing my skin in? I have a mattress cover but I wonder.....\nDate: 13 Dec 1996 17:49:24 From: Ken Subject: Ken- new formula\nThe patch testing sounds like a good approach, thanks.\nOne aside on this is that the things that bother my skin usually aren't obvious to me (maybe I need to try to be more in tune with what my skin is saying) until a substance bothers it for a prolonged period. I seldom get a smoking gun kind of reaction.\nFor example, I used cheap lotion for a while and it worked... later I had to switch to Eucerin and it worked for a while, then I was irritated by it (probably a reaction to lanolin?). A few months ago, I switched to Vaselin and only recently has it started to not work nearly as well as it did the first month.\nIn the same way, I can't tell what specific foods bother me in the majority of cases. I usually write down everything I eat every day. If I get a skin reaction, it is usually a day or two later. Then I have to analyze everything I've done, felt, ate, touched, etc.\nDate: 13 Dec 1996 18:22:29 From: Ken Subject: evaporation question: sweat okay?\nI guess we all are slightly different with respect to how much we are irritated by our own sweat.\nFunny thing, the amount of irritation I've faced from my own sweat has varied quite a lot. Not sure how much underlying facts like what I've eaten and my mood reflect in that.\nFor a period of about 3 months in 1994, I was so allergic to my own sweat, that rushing to catch public transportation caused bump like hives to appear within minutes. They disappeared, assuming I stopped sweating, after about an hour. I told my allergist about this and he was unaware about such a condition so I said, \"I'll be back\" and then ran up and down the stairs a few times. Sure enough, itchy bumps.\nMore commonly, when I sweat like Ann described, I'm irritated by the continuous sweating and then drying out. If I sweat profusely over a short time (like going for a run), but am able to take a shower before the sweat completely evaporates, it doesn't bother me. Strange, but true...\nDate: 13 Dec 1996 19:00:54 From: Rebecca Subject: Product to stop the itch\nI had such a bad time this morning with my scalp eczema itching, that at my lunchbreak from work I went to the local chemists. As well as buying a magnesium supplement (thanks to whoever suggested that!) I found a cream called Eurax, by Zyma Healthcare, Holmwood, RH5 4NU, UK. Well, I applied it as soon as I got back to the office, and it stopped the itching immediately. It claims to soothe it for 6 to 10 hours, and it did actually stop my itching totally for 5! I hope this helps other people.\nThe Eurax cream is \"Crotamiton BP 10% in a vanishing cream base\". It does say though, not to use on broken skin, so if your eczema is bad enough that it has caused cracking etc, then it is probably not a good thing to use...\nDate: 13 Dec 1996 19:22:03 From: Marilyn Subject: Scrubbing Fingernails- Steve\nSteve - I would like to know what the problem with your fingernails was, before the fortunate improvement. My eczema occurs mostly on my hands and fingers, but I have no problem (yet) with fingernails. I have heard that many problems with nails and cuticles are fungal in nature, and two friends have told me had years of ragged, inflamed cuticles and topical application of tea tree oil cured the condition immediately.\nDate: 14 Dec 1996 07:43:20 From: Christine Subject: Salty Sweat & Scalp eczema\nCould it be salt in sweat that causes it to aggravate the skin when the skin in raw from eczema? When my skin was raw, my sweat burned. Now that I'm better, it doesn't bother me. Regarding sweat and evaporation and particularly if you have raw skin, since tap water isn't salty like sweat, it should feel better than sweat.\nDate: 14 Dec 1996 10:28:36 From: Steve Subject: Scrubbing Fingernails- Steve\nThe fingernail problem was not serious, it was mostly in appearance. My fingernails looked sort of ragged with \"unsmooth\" skin which was slightly peeling. My fingernails had a beat up sometime soiled unkempt look. Under the nails at the front edge was a ridge of something that made my nails look double. The nice \"manicured look\" was distant. The nice clean ridge of white along the front edge which is present in a attractive manicured look was not present. All that is now gone and my fingernails have a \"well cared for neat clean\" look.\nCuticle problems I am pretty certain can be avoided by avoiding such things as cuticle sticks.They break the seal between he nail and the skin. Just a stiff brush and Ivory will keep them looking good. If Ivory does not agree with you, some other mild soap.\nDate: 14 Dec 1996 10:35:42 From: Steve Subject: sweat okay? H20? Sherry,Ann,Ken\nThe skin is THE major excretion organ. Perhaps when your sweat is irritating you it is excreting something you took in which is a problem. You folks who have different effects from sweat, how does the amount of water you drink effect these \"sweat effects\".\nI am thinking if your body is flushed with fresh water, perhaps your sweat will be less irritating. AND perhaps what you are eating has an effect on your sweat reactions. So many variables.\nDate: 14 Dec 1996 11:02:05 From: Steve Subject: Allergy to the Sun/PABA\nI am wondering about FOUR things: ( for this moment anyway )\nIs your 'sensitivity' to the sun a vitamin deficiency? If so, could it ironically enough be a PABA deficiency? PABA is: para amino benzoic acid, which is one of the B vitamins.\nHow would do if you took the PABA as vitamin? I did and found it quite effective as a sun protector.\nIs your sensitivity to PABA externally really a sensitivity to one of its carriers?\nAre there several sources for PABA? As you know there are several sources of calcium ranging from Oyster shell to milk. Could it be that PABA has a multiple sources also, and that you might avoid a PABA sensitivity by finding another source? (If so, I too, would like to know how to determine the source of PABA.)\nTry exposing to sun 2 minutes at a time before 11AM and after 1PM.\nDate: 14 Dec 1996 15:51:59 From: Ann Subject: exercise allergy?\nKen, What you described (hives upon running for the bus) as an allergy to your sweat sounds more to me like exercise induced allergy. I'm surprised that the allergist to whom you demonstrated the phenomenon didn't know about it. I think this can be serious so it wouldn't hurt to mention it to your current doctor. The fact that this doesn't happen to you now could be because maybe you are no longer eating the \"trigger\" food before running. I remember reading about someone who went into anaphalaxis any time they exercised after eating celery!\nDate: 15 Dec 1996 12:16:15 From: Kelly Subject: Eurax\nRebecca, I looked up Eurax and it's classified as: Scabicides & Pediculicides; that's all I found, that it was used for treatment of scabies.\nDate: 15 Dec 1996 22:50:42 From: Ali Subject: bad hand eczema flareup\nAnybody out there with any good suggestions (besides dermatologist) for a bad hand eczema flareup? I'd like to avoid steroid creams/ointments if possible. Am looking for alternate treatments. I know the usual, wear rubber gloves, avoid soap, etc. I work with books and that's extremely drying to the hands, so any suggestions are appreciated.\nDate: 16 Dec 1996 04:30:08 From: Gary Subject: Hand eczema\nFor a bad hand eczema flare-up, try Lac Hydrin without the steroid in it. Your dermatologist should be able to prescribe it for you.\nDate: 16 Dec 1996 07:42:06 From: Kelly Subject: New subscriber\nBig effect, the antibiotics destroy our intestinal flora balance allowing yeast to become overgrown. When our flora is unbalanced, we loose some of our protection and allergens pass through our intestinal tract more easily and rapidly. Anyone on antibiotics needs to supplement with acidophilus (yogurt in this case just won't cut it), check with a Naturopath, I wouldn't have a clue how much to give someone of your son's age.\nDate: 16 Dec 1996 11:24:11 From: Jolie Subject: Advice needed\nMy doctor has prescribed the following for my 9 month old: Soaking baths 1-2 xs daily. Apply Vanicream moisturizer afterward. Then apply triamcinalong (.025%) ointment. At bed time apply Hydroxyzing. Does all this help? Every time a cream blocks his pores he goes crazy.\nDate: 16 Dec 1996 12:48:01 From: Patsy Subject: new idea?\nThis weekend, a nurse told me she had cleared up her son's eczema by rubbing hemorrhoid ointment on the lesions. When I began laughing, she said, \"Think about it. Swelling, itching, irritation.\" I'd never heard of anything like that, but what she says makes sense and I'm willing to try most anything. Has anyone heard of or used hemorrhoid ointment on their eczema?\nDate: 16 Dec 1996 14:01:43 From: Kim Subject: New subscriber\nThanks for the input on the antibiotics, the doctor thinks I am crazy when I come up with questions like that! I read a book called Superimmunity for Kids by Leo Galland. He is really big into the essential fatty acids and talked about a simple prick tto tell if a person had become allegeric to Candida Albicans. I guess the next step is to find a new doctor. My son just had a bad breakout as he was comming down with a cold, that seems his MO. Sound typical to you?\nDate: 16 Dec 1996 16:19:04 From: Jolie Subject: To: Debi\nMy son had eczema covering his entire body from the age of 2 months, I tried every possible allergin from breast milk elimination (including changing my diet), to all the different formulas. After many doctor visits to all types, I finally decided he had to have a digestive disorder. At age 4 1/2 months he was diagnosed with leaky gut syndrom and placed on a very strict diet. If this sounds like your case, let me know and I can give you more details.\nDate: 16 Dec 1996 14:05:08 From: Kim Subject: Advice needed\nTom, I can't say I know what will help, I think the baths do. Some doctors say diet isn't a factor but I think you have found a food allergy.\nDate: 16 Dec 1996 17:22:21 From: Ken Subject: exercise allergy?\nI had thought the same thing... it had to be something I was eating or something else I was doing. It made me crazy those 3 months trying to figure out what is was. First I eliminated everything that I haven't been eating/drinking for years. When that didn't work after about 2 weeks, I went on kind of a clean out diet which was basically rice, spinach, lamb, and pears. I was still getting the save exercise induced hives after 2 weeks of that diet.\nAfter 3 months, the symptoms just went away and my sweat only slightly irritated me. Because I've had 2 pretty bad flareups in the last 4 months, I'm starting to write more in my journal to try to put things together... trying to find that trigger or triggers that are involved.\nDate: 16 Dec 1996 17:38:10 From: Ken Subject: Salty Sweat & Scalp eczema\nI agree that perhaps the salt in sweat causes it to aggravate the skin when the skin is raw. About a month ago, I did a lot of snorkelling. My skin got more and more irritated by the salty water every day so that after the 4th or 5th day, it burned too much to go in the water.\nA very good point: Anyone with eczema or dry skin on their scalp should not be using a blow dryer.\nDate: 16 Dec 1996 21:22:33 From: Ann Subject: Patsy's new idea\nPatsy, I've never tried it, but what a great idea. Prep. H is an anti-inflammatory so it makes sense that it would work. And the best part is that it is NON-STEROIDAL! I may get some and try it myself.\nP.S. when I was on Naprosyn for a shoulder injury, my skin cleared up and I wanted to stay on it to avoid steroid use. (Naprosyn-spelling?-is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory.) I was told however that long term use of this drug is bad on the stomach.\nDate: 17 Dec 1996 11:06:14 From: Kelly Subject: New subscriber\nThey come from the same gene because of this our eczema could disappear and we could get asthma or end up with both like you. I've always hoped the asthma would become dominant and the eczema would be gone, it does happen so I may get my wish yet.\nDate: 17 Dec 1996 11:46:33 From: Fayez Subject: sweat okay?\nI have trouble with my skin when I sweat. But I noticed that if I keep my body flushed with fresh water, it is less trouble. I imagine because whatever is in the sweat, leaves my body through my bladder rather than through my skin.\nMy hygiene teacher taught us, that a good way to measure your intake of water, is the color of the water you pass at night. It should be clear. If not then your water intake is probably not enough.\nAs for sweat, I find that I need to shower more often, to remove the sweat from my skin. Otherwise I will have a miserable time. But if a shower is not practical, I will merely wash the area that is giving me trouble. Usually it's my neck, the top of my elbow, and back of my knee. I use lukewarm water, and soap and then immediately apply vaseline to the area. And I'm ok.\nDate: 17 Dec 1996 12:19:30 From: Wren Subject: eczema and Sealed Buildings: Are they linked?\nAs an update to the rest of you who've known about my experiment with the herbs: after cooking up the Chinese herbs for about 6 months (with strength and frequency decreasing over time), then drinking a pleasant tasting prepackaged tea once or twice daily ever since, and applying ointments to my open (formerly) or rough spots, I am 98% well.\nI now eat almost everything, including wheat, sugar, and occasional dips into beef, lamb, fish, citrus fruits, and, gulp, even wine. I'm amazed and feel very blessed that Dr. Yu's diagnosis of \"excess wind and heat\" and her subsequent treatment have been successful. I wish I could transmit my healing energy to all of you - and believe me, I try. May you all have delightful holidays and improved health in the coming New Year.\nDate: 17 Dec 1996 13:00:26 From: Kathy Subject: New subscriber\nI have tried the evaporation method - and I have mixed feelings. I felt better at the start - the inflammation went down, but, it came back with a vengeance the next day. I have had better luck with \"Calendula Gel\". It relieves the pain and itching - and I'm curious as to whether this is going to have a lasting effect. The lesions are crusting, and they don't itch. Time will tell...\nDate: 17 Dec 1996 13:48:30 From: Shelley Subject: Advice needed\nJolie: Noticing that your son goes crazy when his pores are blocked is a good first step to dealing with this condition. Everyone who lives with eczema must learn to tune in to the body's reaction to treatment. All treatment must be adapted to each individual and reactions vary from moment to moment. Experiment with putting less cream/ointment. Use less each day to see how much he can tolerate and yet still have affect. Notice if he can tolerate more of an ointment-type medication or a cream-type. Some parts of his body may prefer an ointment and for some areas a cream may be better tolerated.\nThe amount of bathing and the temperature of the water are also factors. You must experiment with what works for your child. My personal experience is that 10 minutes is long enough. Soaking in baths for hours always made my skin worse. And cool to cold water is better for me than warm. I have seen children screaming with agony from eczema calm down as soon as a cold wash cloth was placed on their back, or wherever it itched. Overheating is a common problem. When your son \"goes crazy\" as you say, he may be too hot, especially with creams/ointments blocking his pores. Experiment with temperature relief. Ice packs may be too strong for an infant but a cool to cold wash cloth may be fine.\nSoothing humming or classical music is also good.\nGood luck from a former screaming child, 40 years later...\nDate: 17 Dec 1996 23:04:09 From: Debi Subject: Leaky gut syndrom\nHi I have not heard of the leaky gut syndrome .What is it? I have noticed that any change to her diet is cause for a flare up. I really noticed it when she ate anything that had a hint of wheat in it. Is there a correlation between ezcema and gluten intolerance? My daughter really wants finger type foods but I'm really limited in what she can eat. Does anyone have any good suggestions for things like soft breads that are gluten free ?\nDate: 18 Dec 1996 10:01:17 From: Jolie Subject: Kim\nKim, My heart goes out to you. I am sorry you have had such a difficult start with your son. Why antibiotics? Ear infections or eczema? Any way, there is no tfor leaky gut syndrom - this is a layman's term. He was born with this physical defect. Adults get leaky gut from chemical exposure and/or poor diet. There are literally holes in the stomach and small intestine lining. The food toxins \"leak\" into his blood stream and then escape through his skin in the form of eczema.\nThis is why my son is allergic to everything. His first allergy test showed he was allergic to corn, soy, raw goats milk, milk, wheat, etc. I thought how could he be allergic to wheat when he had never touched wheat? This is how I made the digestive disorder connection. When I found a pediatric gastroenterologist he confirmed my thoughts.\nMy son was placed on Allimentum formula (the first three days were hell!) then the worst was over, from total body eczema coverage to 25% coverage. He could only eat gerber pears, applesauce and baby rice. He was placed on periactin (benedryl type medicine) to reduce the intestinal swelling and keep his symtoms to a minimum. The theory is that it would give his body a chance to heal.\nAt nine months he is doing great, we have been able to add chicken and maybe oatmeal (we are now testing). He uses the medicine only for flare-ups related to the foods being tested. Let your doctor roll his eyes as you go elsewhere for help.\nDate: 18 Dec 1996 10:08:16 From: Jolie Subject: Debi\nOthers in the group will be able to answer better than I about the food-eczema relationship. In my son's case yes there is a direct relationship, for others there is none. If wheat is the problem, the health food stores sell plenty of wheat alternatives since many people are wheat sensitive. Try OTIOS, a cherio substitute with no wheat. There are some great rice flour breads, etc. Good luck and my thoughts are with you.\nDate: 18 Dec 1996 10:21:41 From: Jolie Subject: Kim\nKim, I just got my answer, your son had ear infections, ah the curse of modern medicine. My daughter also had severe ear infections and guess what they can be caused by (oh your doctors eyes will roll off his head now) the diptheria immunization!! No kidding we have an epidemic of ear infections in this country and the doctors are blaming it on daycare centers, babies drinking their bottles upsidedown, pooping sideways, etc., etc.\nLook at your son's immunization records. If his first ear infection occured 5-7 weeks after the DPT shot, he is a strong candidate! Go to a homeopathic doctor and let them know your thoughts, they will give him an antidote, his ear infections will never return. Am I crazy? No both of my children were successful with this treatment. The candida yeast is a real problem. My daughter at age 8 still has a touch of it. We have worked for 5 years on a no-sugar/low sugar diet. Isn't this fun trading such wonderful health secrets!\nDate: 18 Dec 1996 12:08:32 From: Kelly Subject: Ear infections and food allergies\nJust a note to all you people who have children with chronic ear infections, many, many moons ago chronic ear infections in children was connected to food allergies, so you might want to consult an allergist.\nDate: 18 Dec 1996 12:44:12 From: Heather Subject: Evaporation\nI'm a little confused by this evaporation idea; if eczema has much to do with dry skin (as mine does), then why would letting water evaporate off it be better than trying to seal in moisture by taking lukewarm baths and putting on lotion afterward? I just want to know before I try it. Perhaps evaporation soothes a different type of eczema? I have itchy spots, which become rashy when I scratch them, and spontaneous \"bubbly\" spots, which tend to weep more than the former. Sounds like evaporation would do a better job of treating the latter. Experiences?\nDate: 18 Dec 1996 20:42:37 From: Joe Subject: eczema and Diet\nBefore my diet, I used to eat everything. Milk products, wheat, citrus foods, eggs, etc. And my eczema was very bad. I was covered from head to toe, my skin would bleed and I just felt awful. I asked my doctor if my eczema was related to what I eat and he said no. He just told me that it was hereditary and the bway to treat it was with medication. In fact I got this type of reaction from more than one doctor. When I tell doctors that I'm a vegetarian, they don't seem to take the food - eczema relationship very seriously. Someone on the list posted that food is responsible for eczema in 10% of the cases. Honestly, I think that it should be much higher. I respect doctors, but I think that they should be more receptive to the idea the diet plays apart in controlling eczema. How can someone say that putting something in your system by eating it, does not have an effect on your body?\nAs for my diet, I started it about 5 years ago and I'm still on it today. Along the way, I've added a lot of different fruits and vegetables. Like I said before, I'm a vegetarian. I haven't had any red meat, eggs, milk products for the last 5 years. I'll occasionally have white meat (without the skin). I've eaten chicken maybe about 5 times this year. Mostly because of social circumstances. It's very hard to plan sometimes, especially when you invited out, stay late at school or at work. In those situations, I'll eat meat. I've noticed that in small doses, white meat does make my eczema break out like it used to. I went \"cold turkey\" from the very beginning. I admit that it's very difficult. I've lost weight and gaining it back is very difficult. I also cut out wheat products, which means no bread. I try to avoid any food that has been processed. Processed foods generally contain either milk or wheat in some form.\nSo what do and don't I eat? Like I said before, I've cut out milk, eggs, wheat, meat and citrus foods. Everything else I eat. There are so many different fruits and vegetables out there, that being a vegetarian isn't as difficult as I thought. For breakfast, I'll have some sort of \"soft fruits\". Soft fruits include dates, figs, prunes, dried bananas, mangos, papayas. Dates I find especially good and nutritious. I read somewhere that dates contain the essentially 8 amino acids that the body needs. Can anyone confirm this? They're great for snacks too and for giving the body energy. For supper and lunch, I steam every kind of vegetables that I can find. I usually mix steam vegetables with potatoes. There are a lot of great vegetarian recipes out there. Lentils are a great source of iron and I include those with my meals.\nI guess you could consider my diet as extreme. I'm pretty sure that I've cut out a food that I'm probably not allergic to. But overall I think that it's worth it. This type of sacrifice is worth it if it means that I can have a social life. Like I said, growing up, my eczema covered my body from head to toe. It was awful and very humiliating. I never went to the pool in the summer time, never wore shorts, had long sleeve shirts, etc. Since I began my diet, my eczema has disappeared on my body, I don't put any sort of skin cream on anymore and most importantly to myself, I have a social life.\nDate: 18 Dec 1996 22:41:22 From: Faith Subject: Evaporation\nTo add to Christine's description of what happens with evaporation, remember that evaporation is a cooling process. Your body takes advantage of this on hot days by making you perspire. The moisture on your skin surface evaporates, cooling your skin and making you feel cooler (eventually, anyways!). Translate this into the eczema world, and remember that, for most folks, cold helps calm the itching and inflammation. The hydration involved in the thin wet-wraps that Christine speaks of is not the focus; rather, the evaporation of moisture out of those sheets cools them, and with them touching your skin, cools your skin as well.\n(caveat -- I've never tried this particular treatment, just throwing in a bit of science. Makes sense, and it's something I may try soon, but I haven't yet done it...)\nDate: 19 Dec 1996 06:25:34 From: Christine Subject: Ear Infections\nMy toddler was having ear infections one after another (practically continuously) for a little over a year. The day his adenoids were removed, all those ear infections stopped. This was related in my son's case.\nDate: 19 Dec 1996 08:34:46 From: Kelly Subject: leaky gut question\nI think I can clear this up a bit. When undigested food and toxins collect in the intestines (bowel toxemia), they are then absorbed into our blood stream, our bodies see them as foreign invaders (antigens), producing antibodies to destroy them and at the same time destroying healthy tissue. One problem being, a deficiency IgA (which binds with the undigested foods and toxins in the bowel), when deficient, doesn't bind, allowing these items to pass through. Another problem being, when this process does happen, it causes abnormal cell reproduction. Yet another being that it overloads our liver, decreasing it function that has already been decreased from the bowel toxemia. There are many complications to this condition. Leaky Gut Syndrome has been connected to several autoimmune diseases and eczema is one of them.\nIt's a long time known FACT, that animal fats (your meats, milks, etc...) cause inflammation (forever we have been told milk is good, which while they were telling us this, they knew it was crap), this is not an allergic response, so this has nothing to do with food allergies, just how the body reacts to animal fats, we should never consume them, even the skinless chicken breast has way more fat then they lead you to believe. The vegetables fats (oils) are anti-imfammatories, eat them. The common diet for eczema is 50% - 75% raw veg/fruit. Scientists have known for a long time the role that food plays in our condition, again none of this has anything to do with food allergies, say none of us had food allergies, we still would need to change our diet to improve our condition, there's no way around it.\nDate: 20 Dec 1996 00:31:32 From: John Subject: New subscriber\nHISTORY:\nFor 55 of my 57 years, I had no signs of any kind of skin problems. As a kid, I do remember getting lots of warts, mostly on my hands. I still have 20 or 30 on my hands, but they're small and not even obvious to me unless I look close. They don't give me any problems, and never really did. Then, at age 55, eczema exploded on the backs of both hands. My hands looked terrible and the itching drove me to scratching furiously. Naturally, they became infected and stayed that way for months. Like most men, I guess, I was reluctant to see my doctor, even though he is a close personal friend and never charges me a nickel. Then I started getting a strange sensation around my mouth and nose, and thought that I might be \"spreading\" this curse of mine (I had no idea it was eczema at the time) and was more than a little worried. So I went in to see my dr (finally) and he took one look and gave me the bad news - eczema - live with it - that I'll probably take it to the grave. (pleasant thought, eh?) He did give me a shot (cortisone, I think) and a sample tube of Beta-Val (betamethasone 0.1%) and told me that my scratching was making it worse by infecting it. The one shot worked pretty good. The cream worked (works) pretty good - when I remember to put it on.\nA year or so BEFORE my first eczema outbreak, we adopted a stray kitten here at the office. He has had all his shots, been neutered, and is - more or less - a house cat now. But when he was a kitten, I used to play with him and my hands would sometimes be cat-scratched in many places - mostly on the backs of my hands. THIS is what I attribute to the start of my problem. I have never been allergic to anything - I eat any food I want - or try to, and am generally a meat-and-potatoes-type guy. I do not drink alcohol, but I do smoke cigars. I also work with chemicals, and have for years, but I have never had any bad reactions to any chemical. Of course, I AM careful - I use surgeons gloves when handling even diluted chemicals.\nI don't know if this has any bearing on anything, but at age 25 or so, I had a severe bout with rhumatoid arthritis. At the time, I had constant pain in my hands, fingers, my back, and just about every joint in my body. The doctor (the same one) thought it might be gout, but when there was no respite with the then standard medication, he told me it might be RA and sent me to hospital. There, I was diagnosed with RA, and immediately went on the gold therapy for the next two or three years, administered by my doctor friend. I started out with weekly shots, and tapered off to zero after a couple of years. The results were miraculous - after six months, I was virtually free of pain and swelling and had 99% mobility back. As far as I'm concerned, I have been in complete remission in the 30 years since then. But since RA is also an auto-immune disease (disorder), I'm wondering if this makes me more prone. I know of no other cases of eczema or RA in my family.\nWHAT HAPPENS TO ME My eczema started on backs of my hands and fingers (almost symmetrically), and is still (primarily) there. I have noticed that it tends to pop up other places too. I have had it appear (sporadically) on the soles of my feet (it looks different) and, lately, just above the small of my back - (don't know what it looks like). When I start to feel it on the edge of my nose and upper lip, I know it is on a \"peak\".\nMY TREATMENT(S) So far, the cream is my main treatment. It works pretty good. I apply it VERY sparingly, to only the raised or obviously affected area. I always use a Q-tip and a 45 gram tube can last me months. I don't think the cream is expensive - we have a $10 prescription pay plan and I think they only charged me $5 for the last tube.\nThe itching on my hands is a love-hate relationship. The urge is irresistible and sometimes I scratch and my hands get torn up before I realize what I'm doing. The Bthing (for me) is hot water. I have a rutual I use several times a day: First, I run the hot water until it's just a tad hotter than I can stand. Passes in the water stream are bliss! And it doesn't tear up my skin. I DID burn myself a couple of times before I had the procedure down pat. Now it's easy and almost a high point of the day.\nTHIS IS WEIRD I do use something else too - I haven't seen any mention of it, but it has helped me - especially with cracked, open skin cracks and small sores. Actually, I started using it when the kitten (remember the kitten?) started tearing up my hands. Even when I washed my hands immediately after getting scratched up, the scratches would sometimes get red and angry. The kitten (now a cat) is more careful now and so am I. But since then, I have also used the same stuff on my eczema sores also with good results (my sores are all small, not larger than a quarter). ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? Crazy glue. It sounds crazy, but it works. I use a thin coating of crazy (cyanoacrylate) glue over the sore. What it seems to do, is to seal off the wound against infection. In a couple of minutes it forms an air-tight and waterproof coating that wears off in a couple of days. By then, the sore has healed or I reapply. Under the glue coating, the itching seems to subside too, although I still use the hot water routine.\nI have developed a morbid interin the progression of this disease on my body. After my first sessions with the glue treatment, my eczema disappeared almost entirely for almost a year. In the past few months it has been creeping back to essentially the same places, but I am smarter now, and resist the temptation to scratch it with my fingernails, and use the hot water, then the cream to handle the problem. If the skin breaks, I immediately glue it up, because it only gets worse if I don't. Also, small injuries to the skin seem to prompt an eczema attack, so they all get the glue treatment. When treated with the glue, injuries heal within a day or two and don't develop into the typical eczema sore.\nDate: 20 Dec 1996 05:32:13 From: Brigit Subject: leaky gut\nIn addition to what Kel said on this topic, I'd like to add that the \"holes\" in the intestines are not really that, of course, you'd be quite dead indeed if they were. The idea is that macromolecules (big un-broken-up molecules) pass the intestine lining into the blood stream, causing no end of trouble.\nI asked my gasto-enterologist about leaky gut syndrome, as in, is this a \"respectable\", professionally accepted theory? He said yes it is, whenever he attends a conference there will be a lecture or two, however it's just a SYNDROME, meaning a bunch of symptoms that go together. They have no idea what to make of it, or even whether it's relevant.\nIf you search on the Web you will find only \"alternative\" sites talking about it, often *very* alternative indeed. That's why I asked my gasto-enterologist.\nIt's often linked to candidiasis.\nDate: 20 Dec 1996 10:31:30 From: Jolie Subject: eczema and Diet\nThis information will help my son in the future, he too was covered head to toe at age 2 1\\2 months, we have greatly restricted his diet and have the eczema under control. At nine months he eats 6 different foods but his eczema covers only 15% of his body. I test a new food every week. I will take your list, ie. lentils and thim. If you have time, some food pointers would be greatly appreciated, I have noticed that citrus bothers him.\nDate: 20 Dec 1996 11:02:15 From: Alex Subject: New subscriber\nI do the hot water trick on occassion when the itching is unbearable, but one of the doctors I've been to explicitly told me not to do this, because, even though it does feel good and relieves the itch, it will aggravate the inflamation and make the problem worse in the long term.\nIf I remember correctly, crazy glue was originally intended as an alternative for stiches. I don't know why it never caught on for that use. I've been using Skin Shield Liquid Bandage , you know, that liquid stuff that you paint on to protect small cuts (and cracks, in our case). It's a lot more subtle than having three bandaids on your hands all the time! Anyhow, it's 4 or 5 dollars for a small bottle at Walgreens, so that might be cheaper than Crazy Glue, but maybe not as durable.\nDate: 20 Dec 1996 11:27:23 From: Kelly Subject: leaky gut\nAll those holes people are talking about don't exist, technically, I think they're referring to the normal passages between our small intestine and our bloodstream, when our mucous barrier is damaged and our baterial balance is off, anything can pass through more easily, things that don't belong but if our digestion was strong, this wouldn't be a concern.\nDate: 20 Dec 1996 14:00:44 From: Michael Subject: CHT\nFor some background, I have had mild eczema since childhood. My eczema gradually became much worse though when I started attending school. After four years, it got to the point where I had constant full body eczema, infections, and I was put on many different antihistamines, antibiotics, and topical and oral steroids. It was fairly debilitating as I'm sure many of you understand.\nI have since moved home and have done all the things my assortment of doctors have suggested such as air filters, hardwood floors, making my poor cat stay outside all the time, dust barrier coverings for my beddings, shaved my head to avoid shampoos, started in a different course of study which kept me out of biological labs, all kinds of moisturizing techniques and bathing regimens, dietary restrictions, relaxation techniques, Chinese herbal tea under a different herbologist and acupuncture. I did improve significantly yet I still had constant eczema, I just didn't have to take so many drugs to control it from getting full blown.\nAt the suggestion of my acupuncturist and since I have heard Wren talk about her success with CHT, I decided to give it a try. I have been seeing Dr. Yu and taking her herbal prescription for approximately 3 months. I feel almost back to normal and I am taking no other medications. Currently I have 6 small sores on my face and scalp that are being very stubborn to go away yet they are improving. I still have mild eczema on the middle of my back and every once in a while, my forehead gets kind of rough. Other than that, my smooth skin has reestablished itself in all other places and I no longer have sudden bouts of sweat, heat, and inflammation unless I stray from taking my medications or the dietary restrictions Dr. Yu has put me on. This is a huge improvement from my symptoms before I started the regimen.\nI feel very comfortable with saying that there is a strong correlation between my symptoms and whether I am drinking the tea. The correlation between my dietary restrictions and my symptoms are a little more vague yet a lot more correlative than my experiences with other dietary restrictions. Since I tend to be a lazy patient, I have strayed from drinking the tea and very clearly, my symptoms have returned. Although, they have been returning with less force than they used to.\nI am still apprehensive though that the herbal tea I am drinking may contain natural forms of steroids or other drugs that may cause serious complications later in life. I noticed when I began drinking the tea, side effects of restlessness and slight nausea which cortisones also produce. Yet these side effects were much milder than say courses of prednisone and currently I do not feel much restlessness or nausea after drinking the tea.\nMy reasoning for still taking the risk of drinking Chinese herbal tea that may contain natural steroids are as follows. Sorry this is taking so long.\nI was miserable with my symptoms and the way they were changing the course of my life, especially my studies. I was fairly desperate.\nMy mother was recently diagnosed with cancer and she needed me to be healthy. This certainly helped me to bypass my apprehensions.\nI have a certain degree of trust in Chinese medicine since it is a fairly old system of medicine and I have been exposed to it since childhood.\nThe following reasons represent why I still am continuing with Dr. Yu's regimen. I am trying my hardnot to rationalize to this list my reasoning. I admit though, there is a very strong motivation for me to do this since I am very frightened at the thought of returning to my previous medications and eczematic skin.\nFirst and foremost, I have developed a trust in Dr. Yu who is a very nice and knowledgeable woman. She has been trained in western dermatology as well as Chinese herbology and acupuncture. She seems to genuinely care about the welfare of her patients and does not tend to overexaggerate my improvement as other alternative practitioners have done. She works primarily with patients with skin disorders similar to mine and she has been doing this for quite a while. Although, she does seem to be extremely confident in her medications which for some reason turns me off.\nDr. Yu has told me that she has had her herbal tea tested for steroid compounds and antihistamines and so far they have come up negative. She plainly admits though that these compounds might be found in the future. She has also related to me that through her experience, she has not seen her patients develop liver or kidney problems. This is not extremely comforting to me since it is hard to follow up on your patients and to draw a correlation. It is nice to know though, that she has thought about this.\nI had my acupuncturist, who I used to see until I realized acupuncture wasn't helping much, look over my prescription. He has also been trained in both western and Chinese medicine and I have a very strong trust in him since he is fairly intelligent and a friend of my family. He said that my prescription used commonly prescribed ingredients that have been used for a long time and the dosages were average. He is fairly confident that I won't develop problems with long term use of this medication. He also monitors my symptomatic progress as well as my physiological progress which Chinese medical practitioners do by feeling your pulse at different places. Again I don't know first hand if this pulse feeling thing they do works but I trust them enough to believe it.\nThe alternative to taking this Chinese herbal medicine is my limited life with eczematic symptoms and intermittently taking drugs that for certain can be damaging. I have been on the maximum oral/injected steroid usage for 2 years and it really scared me.\nI definitely do not want to suggthat this medicine is for everybody. If you absolutely cannot drink really gross stuff twice a day and if you can't afford the uninsured 130$ per visit approximately every 2 weeks this is definitely not for you. I also understand that people have a variety of apprehensions about Chinese medicine.\nI just wanted to relate the debate I've had in my head for the past 3 months in case it may help someone considering Chinese herbal medicine. It basically boils down to my trust in Dr. Yu and my former acupuncturist. I want to again state that I have a strong bias of rationalizing my arguments since I desperately do not want to return to my previous condition.\nDate: 20 Dec 1996 14:08:06 From: Jessica Subject: Infantile eczema\nMy son (8-months old) had eczema on his face when he was almost 2-3 months old. I switched his formula from Milk-based to Soy-based at that time, which helped a little bit, his face eczema got Controlled by using 0.5% Cortide a couple of times a week then. Around his 6-months old, we started to introduce solid food to him, this time, the eczema expanded to all over of his face and legs, we have to use prescribed cortisone almost once everyday to make him feel better, we also tried Benedryl, antibiotics, even Chinese herbs, they didn't help too much.\nFor last a couple of weeks, I switched his formula from soy-based to Allimentum, we saw improvement the next day. Now his face is almost clear up, his legs stop getting worse. we use Aquaphor on the legs several times a day now. the bis we don't need any cortisone at all.\nThe only thing I still concern is if he is getting enough nutrition. Currently, we feed him only Allimentum, Apple (sauce, juice), Rice Cereal, a little bit carrot and green leaf vegetables everyday, we are trying oatmeal now. I know eczema baby are very sensitive to Milk, Egg and some Meat, But we would like give him a try. Anybody knows what kind of food (Milk, Egg, Meat related) are less sensitive to those kinds of babies?\nDate: 20 Dec 1996 14:46:16 From: John Subject: Hot water & glue\nHOW 'BOUT THAT! Just goes to show you that not all doctors are alike! Mine said that the hot water wouldn't hurt, and, actually, said that before I apply the Beta-Val to use the hot water. He said that hot water opens the pores of the skin & tends to make the skin absorb the preparation faster.\nOne thing he told me was NOT to slather the stuff (Beta-Val) all over the area. Seems as though cortisone is one of the chemicals (medicines) that is subject to \"overload\" (whatever that means). Cortisone, apparently, is only really useful to the injured area - and one of the drugs that should be used as sparingly as possible - on the outside AND the inside.\nI tried the liquid bandage stuff too - but I like the crazy glue better. It dries faster, stays on longer and is cheaper. I bought a pack with three little tubes in it the other week for $1.49. A lifetime supply, I figure. I guess the only downside is that you have to remember not to touch your mother-in-law for a few minutes after the application.\nDate: 21 Dec 1996 14:21:13 From: Steve Subject: Salted Wounds/Trip To Beach/YES IT HELPS!! GO!!\nIf you don't live near the ocean, it is worth saving up for your next vacation near the ocean and making it an experience. If you do do that, start preparing a few weeks before by exposing yourself to the sun in increasing amounts, so when you get to the beach you will be ready to stay in the sun for an hour or so each day and dipping in the ocean several times. This may be the bthing you have ever done for yourself. If your skin in open and would be stung by the saltwater get yourself medicated and heal yourself up however you can so that you can get yourself to the beach. It is a sacrifice that will be worth it a hundred times over.\nDate: 21 Dec 1996 22:45:46 From: David Subject: New subscriber\nI have had eczema since I was in my early twenties. It has mainly been located on my hands and feet. I call it the \"boiling\" type. My daughter has the exact same condition. She started showing signs of her first flare-up when she was fourteen. We both use eucerin and ultravate. It seems to control it most of the time. We both stick to a diet that omits red meat, wheat, eggs and ALL dairy products.\nWe both eat chicken moderately although we feel this should be omitted also. We avoid all processed foods, foods with high fat contents and all acidic citrus foods. If we stay with our diet, we both do well. I have a son who has had various allergies all his life. In the last year he has developed a condition that's new to his dermatologist. It's a peeling of the skin about 1/4 inch wide all the way around his eyes. His doctor says that it is eczema but just a different type than I have (he does not have the \"boiling\" type anywhere on his body). He applies ultravate (.05%) with a cotton swab. It seems to help but not much.\nDate: 22 Dec 1996 01:52:57 From: Debi Subject: Infantile eczema\nMy 8 month old daughter has infantile eczema. I have her on breastmilk because all formulas including Allimentum seemed to make her worse. My doctor recommended I continue to breastfeed for the full year since the bulk of all the nutrients at this age come from the milk or formula.\nMy daughter got worse whenever we introduced any gluten (wheat) foods. Since barley and oatmeal should be avoided in gluten diets we have deleted these. She gets rice cereal, yorgurt, sweet potatoes, carrots, squash, peas, and green beans. She hates all fruit.( spits it back out if you give it to her). To give her some texture I give her plain rice cakes. She loves them. I am also talked with my doctor about meat. She stated that I should try chicken or turkey but not the jar stuff. Smash up real food.\nDate: 22 Dec 1996 10:37:55 From: Steve Subject: David/Son With eczema Around Eyes\nHello David, I have \"general\" eczema but my eyes are usually free of problems, until I get off my diet. I am not sure but I think chocolate and/or nuts affect my eyes more than other parts of my body. They affect my whole body but ...\nWhen I eat other products, they affect my hands more. Corn products of a certain type. I haven't narrowed that down yet either. It takes painful trial and error. I see no one else talking about this \"body specialized\" kind of allergy. More thinking needs to be done about this.\nDate: 22 Dec 1996 12:36:05 From: Heather Subject: Eye eczema\nHi David, This sounds like what has happened to me in the past-- peeling red skin, with dry & tight eyelids when I woke up, and cracks at the corners of my eyes. I had this last winter, and it cleared up over the summer (I had also been applying topical betamethasone valerate in an intensive plastic-bag treatment over my torso for one week in June). I've managed to stave it off since June by:\nwashing my face only once a day (morning) with generic Cetaphil lotion\napplying generic Eucerin *cream* to the eyelids and under the eyes 2x/day (immediately after washing, and before bed)\napplying a little dab of petroleum jelly to the corners of my eyes before going for long walks outside in the winter cold.\nI was instructed not to use steroids near my eyes, and haven't needed to. However, Eucerin and its generic copies have lanolin in them, which could definitely be a problem if your son is sensitive to that!\nDate: 22 Dec 1996 13:13:59 From: Bob Subject: Infantile eczema\nAt 6 mos all your child needs is formula and Allimentum is a fine formula. The other foods you are trying are also fine. The only people in the US who are convinced you need milk to grow up well are the people who sell milk and advertise on TV to drink milk. For 20% of the worlds population nothing is worse than milk because they are allergic to it's protein. Add only one new food a month to the list you wrote and you will do well--stick with rice cereal and avoid milk products. After one year old you can add calcium fortified juices like OJ. and any table food is OK. Until one year old keep it simple and basic, nature will take care of the rest.\nTry eliminating all cows milk products from your diet, many patients have had astounding success with this simple intervention. And it is free too.\nDate: 22 Dec 1996 14:34:49 From: Man Subject: E around eyes\nI have had eye difficulties (glaucoma diagnosed in last year) partially due to long term (27 years) daily use of topical steriods on face and not particularly around eyes although I do have eczema on eye-lids inside and out! I use Glaxal Base around the eyes and petroleum jelly (vaseline) when they are irritated and stave off dryness.\nDate: 22 Dec 1996 22:14:16 From: Kay Subject: New subscriber\nFive of my children have unusual allergies and rare medical problems directly associated with impaired small bowel function, missing enzymes, elevated IgE, and suppressed immune function. They do get better as they grow up, thank God.\nThese problems with my babies have necessitated a pro-active position on my part. (I have read countless abstracts from the Index Medicus over the years in self-defense.) The Internet is an indispensable ally to my cause and I am grateful this group is online.\nEthan (also known as E.J.) is 13 months old. He first presented with RSV at 4 weeks of age. My pediatrician commented then that he might develop asthma down the road. She also remarked about how dry his skin felt and commented that this was the fifth child I had brought in with pretty aggressive cradle cap. She mentioned the possibility of future eczema based upon these findings. I pondered this and waited. We have since been blessed to have only two episodes of reactive airway disease (like baby asthma) so far. We were not so fortunate to avoid the eczema.\nWhen EJ was about six months, the eczema appeared as if on cue. It primarily affects his legs, especially the creases of his ankles. He occasionally scratches the back of his neck and elbow creases. Those are the only significant outbreak areas. I have read so many severe accounts of eczema that I am almost embarrassed by the lightness of our problem, except for the fact that he is now failing to thrive and spends so much of the night crying and scratching. I, too, am exhausted by so many sleepless nights.\nI have prayed for wisdom and answers all week long and am finally starting to see movement in the log jam. If I recall correctly, as soon as EJ began crawling off the blankets I set out for him, our troubles began. I only realized that last night and have a strong suspicion that 10 years of HEAVY traffic on carpets may be a MAJOR culprit. We must be dust mite heaven around here!\nToday was EJ's one year check up. He is developmentally doing well, but is falling quickly behind physically. Having been born at 10 lbs. 3 oz., he is only 21 lbs, now. His height percentiles far exceeds his head measurements and weight. He and I are both shadows of our former selves. It is time to act.\nMy pediatrician (who is also my bfriend and incredibly open to non-traditional medical suggestions) and I drew up a seven-stage plan of attack:\nBegin 1 tsp. Benadryl at bedtime (only), starting tonight.\nThe day after Christmas, get a hotel room for the children while my husband and eldson pull up all the carpets. We will have to live on the sub-floor for the time being as we will have to re-floor (we have chosen Pergo laminate because it will stand up to high traffic better than wood flooring) each room as we can pay cash. The living room will be first.\nInstall a whole-house water filter system and get chlorine out of EJ's bath water.\nEven though I was using \"All Free and Clear\" for my wash, I am going to pick up some Japanese laundry discs from \"Real Goods\" catalogue so I can stop using laundry soap altogether. (No kidding!)\nAs soon as we possibly can, husband and son will clean out the heating and air conditioning system by vacuuming and washing. Good filters are changed monthly, but the ducts are really nasty.\nContinue nurse EJ while avoiding corn (major offender), wheat, beef, nuts, shellfish, eggs, milk, and soy in my diet. If he does not begin successfully expanding his diet and gaining weight in the next for weeks we will experiment with a low allergen formula like Nutramagen ($$$) : - ( EJ currently has failed to tolerate oats, rice, or barley.\nContinue to keep his skin covered at all times. (He is wearing his sisters' leotards as the socks come off and he tears his ankles up within minutes.) Keep nails short. Use Aquaphor on his entire body at EVERY diaper change. Lukewarm baths 3x week and Aquaphor within three minutes of removal before the pores close.\nThat's it. We have no pets. I use no soap on EJ. He wears mostly cotton. He has no stuffed toys. No one smokes. Did I leave anything else out???\nDate: 22 Dec 1996 22:14:16 From: Ralph Subject: New subscriber\nKay, there is a lot of material relevant to EJ's problem in our archives. My own son suffered from moderate to severe eczema until he was almost two years old, including significant delay in his height and weight progress. At that time, he was virtually cured (!) by an intensive two-week course of topical steroid, tar baths, and oral antibiotics. He has not suffered any significant eczema since then.\nHe just turned eight last month, and is now growing well, although he is still somewhat small for his age. We were reluctant to use steroids, as was the pediatrician, but in retrospect, it was well worth it. I will always be grateful to the dermatologist who helped us.\nDate: 23 Dec 1996 10:55:34 From: David Subject: E around eyes\nUltravate is halobetasol propionate made by Westwood Squibb. My son informed me that he no longer uses it around his eyes. A physican's assistant prescribed this to him. A return visit to the dermatologist resulted in him telling him not to use it in or near his eyes. Now he only uses Eucerin (by the way, he doesn't wear spectacles).\nThe product Eucerin does contain lanolin alcohol. Myself and my children seem to tolerate any allergic effects from it. I no longer use any steroidal creams on my feet but I do use it elsewhere. The eczema on my feet is completely gone through the use of Eucerin.\nDate: 24 Dec 1996 03:03:44 From: Tom Subject: Infantile eczema\nJessica, My son is on the same diet. We also have periactin, a benedryl type product that the doctor prescribed. Recently my son has expanded to prunes, pureed chicken and sweet potatoes. His other foods are pears, applesause, infant rice and squash. Oatmeal is definately out. We are looking for other foods, which ones have you been successful with? Please respond. There are not very many of us with this type of problem. My son is now 10 months old.\nDate: 24 Dec 1996 03:15:51 From: Tom Subject: to Kay and EJ\nMy son had eczema so bad it covered his entire body, he too never slept. My gastroentrologist place him on a diet of allimentum formula, gerber pears, applesause, rice. His eczema was reduced to 15% total coverage. It too had to give up breast feeding even after radically changing my diet.\nDate: 24 Dec 1996 11:43:04 From: Brigit Subject: crazy glue--what is it?\nTo all of you Americans: What on earth is crazy glue??!!! Please describe in such a manner that us Olde Worlders may recognise what you're talking about...\nDate: 24 Dec 1996 12:37:25 From: Christine Subject: Crazy Glue Is ...\nAn all-purpose instant glue. It specifically says on it, though:\nWARNING: EYE AND SKIN IRRITANT. BONDS SKIN INSTANTLY. It contains ethyl cyanoacrylate and says to avoid contact with skin and eyes. When John said that he uses it to bond his skin, I was surprised.\nDate: 24 Dec 1996 13:26:26 From: Donna Subject: crazy glue--what is it?\nCrazy Glue is a popular brand name of a type of cyanoacrilic glue, collectively known as 'superglues', which bond almost instantly. Types of 'crazy glues' are used in medicine and dentistry to seal tissue, but its use is limited as it can be quite toxic.\nIt's also used to attach artificial fingernails, and commonly causes allergic reactions.\nDate: 24 Dec 1996 15:51:49 From: John Subject: crazy glue\nHi, Brigit: By now you have your answer as to what \"crazy glue\" is. It is available on the continent, under the same brand names as in the USA.\nMostly, it is used to instantly bond any non-porous substrate. In my case, I have used it to help my eczema.\nMy eczema is mostly on my hands - If my skin breaks open (by itself, by cuts or by scratching) I apply a SMALL amount of the glue to form a cover. It dries to a hard coating in a couple of minutes, seals off the area from germs, dirt, water and reminds me not to scratch the area. If I see a new eczema welt starting, it gets glued! My eczema starts with small white bumps under the skin which soon break through, and sometimes exudes a pus-like substance. The glue gets applied to those areas and usually within an hour or two the itching seems to subside. After that, many times the welts never develop. Actually, my hands look pretty good right now. Remember, my eczema is on my hands, so it is easy for me to treat.\nToxic? Well, I guess if you ATE some. Topically, on the skin, it isn't \"toxic\". I guess that there might be some people who are allergic to it - after all, there are people out there that are allergic to Mother's milk!\nThe tube I'm presently using is another brand (Super Glue), but they are all cyanacrylate esters - a different name, but all the same stuff. My tube says that you shouldn't use it internally or near the eyes. It doesn't say it is irritating to the skin.\nActually, I have been using this stuff for about three or four years now - it doesn't seem to hurt ME - I don't know about you. I work with my hands a lot, and wash my hands MANY times a day, and sometimes small cuts on my hand develop into eczema sores. Even if they don't, I use the glue to seal up those small cuts. It has helped me almost more than anything else.\nIt seems to me that with eczema, it's \"whatever it takes\" - and I don't think my treatment or experience is any more bizarre than the \"urine treatment\" - whatever THAT may be!\nDate: 24 Dec 1996 17:58:19 From: Christine Subject: Crazy Gluing Cuts\nI originally laughed pretty hard when I first heard of that. Then, I wondered why not try it. Then, I kinda chickened out. Now, though, I have a cut that doesn't seem to want to heal (that's unusual for me); and, I feel like trying it if you're sure it doesn't hurt or anything like that.\nDate: 24 Dec 1996 18:22:12 From: Ralph Subject: crazy glue\nJohn, I have personally experienced mild itching from various glues, and I'm mildly surprised that you haven't felt anything similar. The fact that you aren't allergic to such substances might be consistent with the possibility that your skin problem is not, in fact, atopic dermatitis.\nAs Donna pointed out, cyanoacrilate glues are often used by surgeons to bond tissues, so one might speculate that these glues are probably not very dangerous in small quantities. I've glued my fingers together by mistake several times using Crazy Glue, with no apparent long-term effects. Even the short term effects did not go beyond some mild irritation.\nIf I were going to tthis method on myself, I would certainly be inclined to try a *very* small amount of the glue on a non-inflamed area of skin before putting it on a raw cut. After waiting perhaps 24 hours to see whether any reaction develops, I might then try a tiny bit on a cut.\n(The above is not intended as medical advice. Consult your dermatologist for skin questions, as well as your mental health professional for general advice on trying bizarre treatments).\nDate: 24 Dec 1996 21:16:40 From: Steve Subject: ViT. C./Crazy Gluing Cuts\nTry vitamin C in large doses ( about 2 grams a day) along with one or two daily vitamins a day and some protein daily in a balanced diet.\nDate: 24 Dec 1996 21:19:06 From: Steve Subject: Addendum to Crazy Glue Message\nUsing the glue may seal in bacteria. Wounds usually are supposed to heal from the inside out, I thought.\nDate: 25 Dec 1996 00:14:36 From: Donna Subject: crazy glue\nCYANOACRYLATE ADHESIVES: Monomers of N-alkyl cyanoacrylate that have been used as a tissue adhesive. This use is limited by the toxicity of the glue... -- Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary\nThis is another common side-effect with those using superglues to attach artificial fingernails... it commonly traps moisture and causes fungal infections of the nailbed. I would imagine the same thing could happen to skin, if it isn't thoroughly washed and thoroughly dried beforehand... and I don't mean towel dried, I'm talking running a hairdryer over the area for a good ten minutes or so.\nSuperglues commonly cause a reaction around the cuticle and fingertips with those wearing artificial nails... it's a common ailment, taught in cosmetics school and discussed in the industry mags... nail techs commonly get a reaction to it themselves. The liquid bandages on the market are similar, and in addition have antiseptic properties...they warn NOT to place on draining wounds.\nYeah, there are two types of eczema...I get the pussy bumps myself, after they break and exude the skin then gets thick, dry, and cracks open...\nDate: 25 Dec 1996 08:31:47 From: John Subject: crazy glue redux\nWOW! I never thought the crazy glue remedy would generate this much controversy! To me it was a natural. The first time I tried it, was on a series of wounds to my forearm by a rose bush I mistakenly raked across my arm. Later on that day, as I was gluing two pieces of plastic together and then, on a whim, glued ONE of the injuries. Miracle of miracles - THAT one sore healed in a couple of days while the others took a week or more to entirely clear up. None of them were serious enough to apply any other medicine, so it was more or less a tof the glue. I was intrigued. Over the next few months, anytime I had a cut or sore, I used the glue. Every time it has worked just as I said.\nI have used it on the eczema ever since, and it has definitely helped ME. I use it on EVERY stage (that I have) and have not had any ill effects so far. I have one sore right now that started the other day, I put the glue on right away and now is almost gone!\nMy secretary uses artificial nails and I looked at the glue she uses. I didn't try it on anything - it's three times as expensive - (does that tell you anything)? Also, the fingernail itself is not like our skin. First of all, it isn't changed as much as our skin - it takes MONTHS to grow out. Our skin can shed itself and regenerate NEW skin in a matter of a couple of days. This is what happens under the glue - as you can see for yourself, since the covering is transparent.\nAnd about sealing germs IN? I don't know about that - I'm not a doctor. But what is the alternative? Leave it open - to garner MORE of the germs or irritants in our world? Maybe cover it with a band-aid? There can't be anything more \"germy\" than an old band-aid that sits there gathering MORE germs and holding them against the wound. Band-aids do a lousy job - how many times do you have to replace a band-aid? Especially if it's on one of those places that are impossible or impractical to bandage - like a knuckle or finger. The glue does the bjob, forming its own bandage that allows you to use your hands and giving your body a chance to heal the wound itself. I imagine most humans, without compromised immune systems, can conquer those few germs that might be under the glue. I just know that MY sores (of any type) just never get red and slowly go away. I can't be too much different from anyone else.\nAll I can say is \"try it - you'll like it\". The next time you get some little cut that bothers you, glue it - you'll see! A couple of weeks ago, my wife cut her finger, in the kitchen, at home. She complained about it and I suggested she \"glue it up\". She resisted, but finally relented, and I put some glue on the cut on the end of her finger. Now she's hooked! It IMMEDIATELY stopped hurting and bothering her. A few days later the cut was GONE! And this was in an area that always takes a long time to heal on anyone.\nAnd no, I hold no stock or any financial interin crazy glue!\nDate: 25 Dec 1996 13:09:46 GMT From: David Subject: Crazy glue\nHi, I've been reading the messages about Crazy glue. My thoughts are:\nBE CAREFUL - did I say that loudly enough?\nWhile it may be true that surgeons use cynoacrylic glues for sealing I'm sure they are more carefully produced than the stuff which is designed for gluing plates together. I don't know if they are chemically the same - even if they are they won't have been sterilised etc. - and anyway I suspect there are many different formulations of the glue and the surgeons use ones chosen for the job.\nThe other thing is the size of the affected areas - I can imagine this being useful for a crack on a finger or something like that but not for a large scale problem. My tip for finger cracks is to find a really thick cream (e.g. unguentum merck) and keep rubbing it in - the trick is to keep the healing wound edges soft so they don't crack more.\nDate: 25 Dec 1996 18:22:29 From: Steve Subject: Tom/Infantile eczema/Poi,Yams,Turkey\nFor a diet low in allergy for babies try poi. It may be available in health food stores. It is made from the taro plant in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific. It may be hard to find. Come to Hawaii and have some. Poi is noted for being easily digestable for babies.\nAlso yams and sweet potato are not likely to hurt. They are not the same. Yams taste bwhen they are cooked unconvered whole without peeling in the microwave. Scrub them well first. The longer you cook them the better they taste up to a point when they start drying out. Try about 10 minutes at first. If it is not dried out increase the time. Puncture the skin in several places so the yam does not explode. Yams are highly nutritious. High in vitamin A, fiber, and potassium. There are tribes in South America that live almost solely on yams.\nIf the baby is ready for meat, try unprocessed natural turkey breast. Read the label to find a brand that adds nothing to it. Cook it well and then put it in a food processor.\nI would ask about vitamins too. But tthem out just as you would a food. A daily vitamin, I think might help to balance the nutrition. Doctors don't seem to know much about vitamins. Vitamin C is most helpful for reducing itching and increasing healing.\nDate: 25 Dec 1996 19:07:53 From: Donna Subject: Crazy glue\nChemically the glue and the surgical stuff is the same, formulation somewhat different. Actually, it is sterile -- one of the big difference between medical superglues and the OTC stuff.\nSurgical superglue is the same, regardless of the particular medical application.\nYou are correct, it's not used for large wounds -- and the larguse is actually in dental applications for sealing extractions, root canals, etc.\nDate: 25 Dec 1996 19:07:53 From: Steve Subject: Part3/Tom/Infantile eczema/Green Beans,Yams,Turkey\nI just remembered another food that probably will be ok. Green beans. They come in many varieties. If you can find \"Italian\" they are most tasty and substantial and are a little more expensive. Next in line are the *whole* Blue Lake green beans. The cut frozen variety lack something, but the whole ones are good. These both are available in frozen form, but are hard to find in the freezer. You may have to ask someone in the grocery store to order them for you.\nDate: 25 Dec 1996 19:44:08 From: Donna Subject: crazy glue redux\n>>Also, the fingernail itself is not like our skin.<<\nActually, it is EXACTLY like our skin...it is a specialized form of epidermis which is created about 1/4 inch below the cuticle (which is also a specialized epidermal tissue).\nA nail consists of a body, composed of keratin, the exposed portion, and a root, the proximal portion hidden by the nail fold, both of which ron the nailbed or matrix. The latter consists of epithilium and corium continuous with the epidermis and dermis of the skin of the nail fold...\nAverage nail growth rate is 1mm per month.\n>> regenerate NEW skin in a matter of a couple of days. <<\nActually, it takes longer, you just don't see the internal processes at work...\nThe reason one should 'leave it open' is that the normal healing process, i.e. scabbing, requires oxygen. One would be safer washing the cut, thoroughly drying it, then putting a thin coating of antibiotic ointment on it and covering it with a bandage for the first stage of healing -- the bandage just basically protects it from further injury as the scab is forming, and keeps large grains of dust and dirt off. But if it's a deep cut, then you'll need to periodically remove the bandage, bath and dry the wound again, and put a new bandage on.\nCrazy Glue would risk sealing in pseudomonas fungi, and salmonella and staph bacteria, all of which are normally present on our skin, but don't present any problems until they get into a wound....remember the infamous tabloid stories of 'flesh-eating bacteria' -- well, that's caused by the staph that's normally present on your skin, and which got into the victims' wounds....\nActually, as long as they are dry, band-aids they are extremely effective...most 'germs' cannot penetrate dry fabrics (hence the use of sterile cotton surgical gowns, caps, and masks in OR)...but germs easily transport wet bandages -- hence, the need to constantly change the bandage. Think about it -- if Crazy Glue was so great to use on wounds, it would be SOP in hospitals, especially ER...\nYou have to replace a band-aid lots of times. That's the point. One bandage is not meant to be used for the whole healing process.\nYou can get bandages specifically designed for those impractical areas like a knuckle or finger.\nDate: 25 Dec 1996 21:03:23 From: David Subject: crazy glue\nHi, John, It sounds like you and I share the same type of hand eczema. I also have the clear \"bubbles\" that appear under the skin. Within a day or two they open, the skin begins to peel, itching begins and the drying effects makes the skin crack and bleed until the healing process gets hold of the situation .\nI usually have a few good days before the process starts again. I also from time to time get these \"welts\" that originate from under the skin. These welts are usually in the middle of the worst area of \"bubbles\". At first they are very sore and red. Then they begin to fill with pus (from within). They then break open and begin to heal. These are not infections from an outward source. My Dr. says they are a reaction in my immune system. I think he's right. When or at what point do you apply the glue? To what areas? How much? Do you apply it only once or several times (to the same welt)?\nDate: 26 Dec 1996 09:59:10 From: John Subject: glue redux - Part 2?\nI realize, of course, that the same cells form fingernails AND skin - and probably everything else too, I guess. What I should have said is that fingernails and skin LOOK different, FEEL different, and grow at much different rates. Skin may take a while to COMPLETELY regenerate (as in the disappearance of a scar) - but that is not what we need. We need cuts, scratches, etc, to SEAL over - and be out of danger from being opened again. Bandages, of course, are supposed to do that job, and there are bandages for fingers, knuckles and other places, but they're just not as good as my super glue! (for me)\nOn my body, (is it different?) the glue seems to take the PLACE of a scab: That is, applied after the bleeding stops, and BEFORE the wound scabs over, the \"red\" underneath doesn't turn dark as in a typical scab - it just heals over and disappears. Cuts also don't bleed under the glue.\nAs an example, I had one crack (on an eczema sore) that has been on the side of my index finger for about three days - an injury from my day-to-day work. It is about 10-15mm long, never did bleed, just stayed red and didn't heal. Since this is Christmas, I haven't done any physical work for that time, and left it alone (no glue, just my Beta-Val creme, traditional stuff) LAST NIGHT was glue night. Guess what? Since JUST LAST NIGHT (as I write, it is now 6am) the cut has now sealed over and I can hardly see the red crack that I saw before. Not only that, but that very slight pain that accompanies these types of cracks disappears within MINUTES of the application. What else can I say?\nDoctors are great. (most of them) --- The medical profession STINKS! (my doctor thinks so too) The medical profession is so wrapped up in their own invincibility, yet are so thoroughly frightened by the threat of litigation that they are LOATH to admit or try new alternatives. I also cannot believe that the \"Crazy Glue Company\" would go through the complicated procedural gymnastics to properly register cyanoacrylates in a use that is extremely limited - especially since they can make FAR MORE $$ from marketing it for its present use as a glue. Even Johnson & Johnson never actively marketed their liquid band-aid. When was the last time you saw a commercial for the stuff? And guess why? Because they can't make any money on it! They make far more (surprise!) on band-aids, I'll venture to guess. Capitalists all, no empathy there.\nDOUBLE WOW!! Fortunately, I have had none of THAT! - Yet. - But I can't help wondering how many germs get on a bandage from the time you unwrap it, move it through the air and put it on your skin. And don't germs grow end to end? Seems they would quickly penetrate the edges of a bandage, and .........!\nActually, I just seem to have terrible luck with band-aids. They never stay on, always get wet and/or dirty, and just like a cop - never a clean one around when you need it. While I still have band-aids in the first-aid kit of my vehicle, it is usually my second choice. Once I put the glue on, it is completely unobtrusive, I can wash my hands, do my work, brush it against something, all without worrying about \"my cut\". It stays on, forms a hard coating, and wears off in a couple of days. I rarely (but sometimes) have to reapply. By the time it wears off, my cut is GONE!\nI hesitate, somewhat, to say this, but I have even applied the glue to a fresh, still BLEEDING cut! Horrors! But guess what? The progression is EXACTLY the same. The bleeding stops - and the cut heals over in a day or two! (under the glue, a scab doesn't form, and, lo and behold, the next few days it still disappears!\nI must say, that my glue treatment has developed over the last couple of years and I have gotten much better at it. I know now exactly how much glue to dispense, exactly how much to use, and where to put it. I used to put too much on - and the applicator tips don't help much. But even when I put \"too much\" on, it still worked - I have, however, worked out exactly how much to use (for me).\nBut to all those willing to try something that FINALLY WORKS, you'll just have to try to see.\nDave, I have experimented with ALL the stages. I have applied glue to the bumps as soon as I see them - before they break. I cover the area of the bumps with the light glue cover. Most of the time the bumps are apparent for a day or so - sometimes they go away completely without anything else happening. If they don't, and the pus comes through, the glue seal is broken and the glue comes off. I wait an appropriate period of time and reapply. This works just as well - I cover the same areas. For me, it even seems to help supress the itching. My eczema does tend to go to the same places, and go in cycles, but they also go away quicker when they HAVE returned - mostly because I get them healed before I re-injure them. I work physically, with my hands, every day, and can't be hobbled by the status of my hands. For me, it works.\nOn cracks, (actually any cut), I try to \"flow\" the glue into the crack alone, and try to limit the application to the crack itself. Not to worry if you over-cover - doesn't seem to matter. It's just that it's not necessary to cover anything but the wound itself. In a matter of a minute or two it's dry, and you can safely touch yourself in any X-rated place. If you're good at the glue application, you can hardly feel it. Until you get proficient, it can look a little sloppy. Still works, though!\nNormally, I don't have to reapply - sometimes I do, even over a previous cover of glue that is currently in the process of wearing off. No problem, but the succesive layers of glue make it look like a sloppy application.\nApplication takes a little self-practice. I have a special pair of eyeglasses (10 power) that gets me right down to the nitty-gritty. The applicators attached to the glue tubes are a little sloppy, so I get it flowing on a section of newspaper, get a TINY bit on the tip of the applicator and flow it into the crack. I have even used a toothpick for really delicate applications. HEY! Now I'm really into this!\nHERE'S WHAT I DO: I prefer doing this procedure at home or the office, where I can apply a drop of alcohol on the cut, (use the 91%, or grain alcohol) let it dry, then apply the glue. If I do any of this out on the road, I might not have the alcohol handy. But it really doesn't seem to make any difference in the healing process, I never used to use alcohol, just the glue. The alcohol is a recent revision, and, like I said, doesn't seem to make any difference. I mention it only to expose all aspects. To understand how well this works (or doesn't work) you have to try it yourself! To this day, I remain amazed at how fast my cuts heal using this stuff.\nFOR THE BRAVE, A TEST: Find two cracks (cuts, wounds, whatever) at the same stage, apply the glue to one. On the other, apply your conventional treatment as you always have. Measure the time it takes to heal and I'll bet the one with the glue heals faster, easier, better and more comfortably!\nDate: 26 Dec 1996 10:57:25 From: Wren Subject: Methods of Cooking Sweet Potatos and Yams\nI agree with Steve that yams and sweet potatoes are filling nutritious foods. When I was on my gluten-free diet I ate lots of rice, white potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, quinoa, and a few other lesser known grains.\nHowever, I have read in several places that microwaving destroys some of the nutritional content in foods, so recommend that the potatoes of all types be baked. I poke holes in them with a fork, put them in the regular or toaster oven for 30-45 min at 350 or 400 degrees. I poke poke them with a fork when I think they're about done. Try sweet pototoes or yams with butter for breakfast - yum.\nDate: 26 Dec 1996 11:02:27 From: Donna Subject: glue redux - Part 2?\nDermis and epidermis is specialized, and are not the same cells as make up the internal organs, veins/arteries, muscles, etc.\nThe key is, you are not sealing anaerobic bacteria in when you put on a bandaid -- the wound, being exposed to the air, does not facilitate their growth.\nWell, the bandaids *I* use have adhesive all around the cotton pad part -- and again, the thing is you don't want to seal IN anaerobic bacteria or fungi -- you WANT the wound to 'breathe', you just want to make sure you keep obvious dirt out of the wound.\nHey, it's your body, do your thing -- I just feel I have to warn about the potential hazards...\nDate: 26 Dec 1996 12:49:42 From: Toby Subject: corn\nThis week I've made a wonderful discovery. I'm allergic to corn. I've been trying to figure out if there was a tie with food and my ezcema. If I eat corn (I love popcorn, you could almost say I'm addicted to the stuff) I break out one to two days after... same with eggs(which I've hated since I was a kid). I'm going to stay away from it and see if my skin clears (wish me luck). The solution is probably not that simple, but it's a piece of the puzzle. I've been tested for allergies to food but my skin was so reactive and broken out the results were questionable.\nI've also been taking selenium for a week and am hoping to get good results from that.\nDate: 26 Dec 1996 14:13:43 From: Jessica Subject: Infantile eczema\nI summarized the food we all successfully tried to our 7-10 months old, we can try those we haven't added to their diet yet. Everybody is welcome to add any less allergy food to this list. I haven't found any less allergy food which is high in calcium.

I've had several years of living like a normal human being, but your condition sounds tons worse overall.\nVaseline can be a problem by itself, too, tho I don't know for sure if it is helping or hindering at this point. I have some white petrol, plain and mixed with stuff, from pharmacy for now.\nHave to tell everyone about my experience at the Hosp ER where my derm dr told me to go for admission. They refused to admit me--my problem didn't warrant admission! Chronic edema, erythema, unrelenting heat, and itching, but my problem was (to them) not really a problem. No conception at all about what CHRONIC means with a derm condition.\nThat's what I love about derm--it's always minimized so easily by other people. As long as you are walking and talking, you couldn't possibly be in pain or agony worthy of much attention. ER Drs were pleasant enough but with no experience with derm, the handout they gave to go home with was a huge laugh (I told them it was a joke!): 3-line description of eczema and what it is (haha), suggestion to contact the Burn Unit (my recent minimal sunburn on top of antibiotic, contraindicated), and more suggestions to use Aveeno, Aquaphor, Lubriderm, and cooling showers! Christ, that's what I've been doing to no avail--and none of those products work for me any more. I SAID I'd had eczema from birth--nobody was listening! As if I couldn't know what eczema is!! I needed to scream just then.\nDate: Sun, 16 Jun 1996 17:34:28 -0700 From: Chuck Subject: Too many blankets/UV Treatments\nA couple of recent messages struck a chord. Samantha's interview transcript pointed out the problem of getting overheated at night from too many blankets. I am always cold, except in the warmest weather, and used to bundle up with lots of blankets until I discovered that they were a primary cause of my severe night itching. I found that I would sweat a lot under the covers and the sweat would irritate my skin. Then, of course, I would start scratching in my sleep and would awaken the next morning a bloody mess. Wearing light pajamas and using a lighter blanket helped significantly.\nRelated to this, I have always had the problem of being allergic to my own sweat. Whenever I exercised or got overheated, my skin got itchy. I posted the problem on one of the health groups, and several people told me I was not drinking enough water. As soon as I increased my water consumption, the sweat allergy greatly diminished.\nLastly, I'm interested in Stephen's good result with UV treatments for his son. I have come to believe from personal experience that Candida (yeast) infection is often a cause of eczema. When people have Candida, it resides in the colon and comes out on the skin, causing itching. I wonder if the UV treatments may be killing the Candida colonies on the skin???\nDate: Sun, 16 Jun 1996 19:48:14 -0500 From: Gayle Subject: Too many blankets/UV Treatments\nI call the night overheating problem the \"nest effect\" and deal with it this way. For some reason Egyptian cotton sheets seem to keep my body cooler than any other all cotton sheets. They feel so wonderful on the skin, but even on sale they are about $50 a sheet. Then I use a light cotton throw over my shoulders only. When it really gets hot and my skin is really bad I take those reusable ice packets (like you would put in a picnic cooler) wrap a couple in towels so they don't sweat and put them in the bed.\nDate: Sun, 16 Jun 1996 17:54:12 -0700 From: Chuck Subject: Samantha's Regimen\nSamantha, Great to hear that you've had as much luck with the Candida diet as Brent and I did. You added a number of points which were helpful, such as drinking filtered water to avoid chlorine. I do that also. Many of your other tips were equally helpful.\nFor the benefit of others who might be intimidated by the diet, there are only a few vital components. Other things help a little here and there, but the most vital thing is to KILL the CANDIDA. To do this, try the following:\nTake garlic or Capryllic Acid at least twice a day.\nTake Acidophilus (good) or Acidophilus with Bifidus (better) at least twice a day.\nAvoid foods you are allergic to.\nAvoid ALL yeast products, including breads, pickled foods, alcholic beverages, soy sauce...anything fermented because it adds yeast to your body when that is what you're trying to get rid of.\nSamantha, you also mentioned Sorbelene cream. What is it? How about a list of ingredients. I still have a few patches of dry skin that I would like to keep lubricated but haven't found anything other than hydrocortisone ointment that doesn't cause an allergic reaction. Maybe Sorbelene will work???\nDate: Mon, 17 Jun 1996 17:32:47 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: Shampoo\nIt seems an awfully obvious thing to say, but how about washing your hair under a hand shower or mixer tap? I know that doesn't remove any problems you have on your head, but at least it keeps it off the body.\nDate: Mon, 17 Jun 1996 09:44:54 -0400 From: Mark Subject: New subscriber\nI came down with the condition about a year ago. My GP misdiagnosed a small patch on my left arm as an infection, and prescribed topical and oral antibiotics. (I was also under great business stress at the time). Within a couple of days, my skin exploded!\nThe dermatologist I was referred to immediately diagnosed eczema, put me on prednisone (oral) and cleared the acute attack. The question then became: what to do about the now-chronic condition.\nJust received my second set of (comprehensive) patch tests, which showed a few allergic reactions, but none to anything I am in common contact with.\nAbout four months ago, I decided to stop using the topical steroid creams for, while they worked, they were certainly not going to 'cure' the condition. While fully aware of the lack of scientific validity of the approach, I've been seeing a homeopath, who has perscribed 'remedies'. After an initial flare-up when I stopped the hydrocortisone, the condition has settled down somewhat, but still flares up. I do not suffer the extreme itchiness that others reportedly experience.\nI have ready access to medical databases, literature, etc., but through all my reading, I am still stumped about why, at 43 years old, I should suddenly be confronting a condition that never before bothered me.\nDate: Mon, 17 Jun 1996 08:53:33 -0800 From: Ann Subject: scalp and genes\nShelley, When your \"friends\" said you wouldn't be selected because of \"bad genes\", you should have said, \"I definitely would be selected because I have survival genes; you haven't been tested ...yet.\" Your statement that there is no magic cure that works for everyone made me think about cures and treatments in general. Many eczema people experience dramatic improvement or total remission at various times in their lives without having tried anything different. So when you do something ( tea, shots, diets etc.) and you get better, it COULD be just chance, with no cause and effect (except for maybe the placebo effect). A true martyr for science would \"challenge\" the results by going back to the old habits to see if the skin got bad again. But most people cured of eczema would choose to not rock the boat; so we hang onto a new regime without actually proving that it was the key.\nKristen, What a frustrating experience you describe! The fact that your scalp isn't bad makes perfect sense to me. Most peoples' scalps (eczema covered or healthy) need to be dried out. The shampoo you were using did the trick. But your skin elsewhere is already dry or, at least, it is easily dried out; so the run-off from your head did damage to face, neck, and chest. That's why I go thru the nylon jacket ritual (it can backfire if shampoo gets trapped under the neck and cuffs, look out!) or simply wash my scalp in the sink, or thickly coat the bad spots with vaseline. You are right, I don't know what it's like to live like in normal skin. But for years, all I had were patches and even though they often looked like lunch meat or worse, they were just patches and I felt in control of the situation and didn't spend hours a day on it. For me, the breaking point comes with the total person rash ( my feet are always almost clear); it's also scary - \"what next?\" Other people may find it easier to deal with the milder all-over stuff and are rocked harder by the small raw patches. Take your pick?\nDate: Mon, 17 Jun 1996 12:48:01 EDT From: Julia Subject: Wet Wraps & UV treatment\nWe've been wet-wrapping our daughter since September and have been very happy with the results. We have tried a variety of other treatments but in the past her skin would veer between not too bad and very bad. Since wet wrapping her skin is between pretty good and clear. It is time consuming but well worth the effort I think. We haven't tried UV because it hasn't been necessary. We continue to use steroid creams and moisturizer, though we use steroids in much smaller amounts than before.\nDate: Mon, 17 Jun 1996 19:11:21 -0100 From: Sandy Subject: Radio National Report - LONG\nHas anyone tried glycerin sorbolene, is there a product called that or do I just go to the pharmacy and ask for them mixed together?\nAnd what about washing your hair with conditioner did anyone try that yet? What do you think? I'm really tired of going to doctors for different cremes and ointments. Maybe this approach could work for me.\nDate: Mon, 17 Jun 1996 10:16:00 PST From: Wren Subject: scalp and genes\nI asked my Chinese herb doctor, about whether people with allergies to plants would be able to use her herbs? She replied that since the herbs are all dried, the substances that people are allergic to are disarmed.\nDate: Mon, 17 Jun 1996 21:34:44 -0800 From: Ann Subject: clarification\nI recently made a quantum improvement when our local grass pollen count dropped . Also I have reduced the allergy shots to once every 3 weeks so that may be helping too. When you commit to allergy shots, you have to expect flares from the shots until you are at a steady level for a long time.\nOn food allergies, I don't eat any \"unnecessary\" plants like seasonings. I do eat high nutrient, high calorie veg products, and try to get a good variety and avoid overdoing any one thing. (For many many years I was a total vegetarian and I think I overdid the soybean products.) I am responding so well to the allergy shots that I may ease up on the diet as foods probably aren't causing any appreciable problem. (my food allergy tests produced a few size 1 hives; pollens and dust produced many size 8 hives - size 4 is the largest standard!)\nOn drying herbs to get rid of the allergens - doesn't make sense to me. Opening a package of POWDERED egg whites used to send me into asthma. DRIED mustard just touching my skin causes a major flare. I came very close to death (yeah, I saw the tunnel of light) from a ROASTED Brazil Nut. I had to jump off a hayride truck once because of the DRIED grass on board. Anyhow, for me food is fuel for athletics and other activities of life so I don't mind eating unseasoned stuff or missing out on certain foods. I think Shelley expressed the same feelings once.\nDate: Tue, 18 Jun 1996 11:03:53 -0400 From: Christopher Subject: New subscriber\nThe only thing that does work is Prednisone, dosage 40 mg a day. But... I have to taper it off as soon as the condition is better and as soon as I go below 40 mg it starts to come back. My wife is suffering worse than I am and I really want to do something positive to stop scratching.\nDate: Tue, 18 Jun 1996 11:06:42 -0400 From: Amy Subject: New subscriber\nI have had eczema for most of my 29 years. For the last nine months it has been very bad, meaning it spread to regions it never had, and when the triamcinolone and other stronger (harder to remember) named corticosteroids failed to work, I quit them cold turkey, about two months ago. Thus my disease expressed itself even worse and I have been in absolute terror of myself since. I finally opted to take the oral steroids to give my skin a break. I am amazed at the improvement and fearful that the bad skin will bloom again once my taper is finished.\nSo now I am seeking help for alternative therapies that don't involve the cycle of corticosteroid dependence. I am going to start the elimation diet to see if wheat, corn, soy, etc, may be the culprit. I already don't drink alcohol or coffee, or eat sugar or dairy products.\nDate: Tue, 18 Jun 1996 16:13:07 -0400 From: Gary Subject: New subscriber\nI have had a lot of luck with my dermologist in treating my eczema without resorting to prednisone except for one three- week burst. He claims to have treated hundreds of eczema patients over the last 30 years and states that in all his experience, eczema is a seasonal disorder - worse some parts of the year, better at others. It's a function of the types of allergens present in the air and elsewhere during given periods. When he told me this, it gave me a lot of hope because I knew that, once my conditions worsened, it was likely to get better again. And it has. And I expect it to get worse again.\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 07:50:17 +0930 From: Samantha Subject: misc.\nStrangely enough, this time of year (the 'dry season') my skin is *always* much worse, but this time 'round it is much better being off all of those foods that I react to.\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 07:50:28 +0930 From: Samantha Subject: hospitals\nOh Kris: How appalling! It is true isn't it? It is \"just your skin\". I don't think they realise the incredible pain that goes with it. The unrelenting, mind blowing, all encompassing itching, burning, stinging etc etc.\nDate: Tue, 18 Jun 1996 22:02:19 -0400 From: Ralph Subject: No dermatologist?\nI was able to locate a Web presence for the American Academy of Dermatology, at\nhttp://www.derm-infonet.com/\nbut unfortunately their server was not responding at the time I tried to reach it.

Maybe I could afford to buy an Egyptian handkerchief to try out the concept!\nDate: Tue, 18 Jun 1996 21:59:12 -0400 From: Ralph Subject: Wet Wraps & UV treatment\nGlad to hear that wet-wrapping has worked for your daughter. This has been explained to me before, but it didn't stick, so here's my question: is there any medication included with the wet wrap, or just water?\nDate: Tue, 18 Jun 1996 22:30:40 -0400 From: Ralph Subject: Interesting Web material on eczema/atopie\nFrom a Web search, I just located the following URL, with some information about atopie:\nhttp://www.rrze.uni-erlangen.de/docs/FAU/fakultaet/med/kli/derma/vorlesun/atopie /atopisch.htm\nThis site includes a sort of atlas of photographs of skin ailments, for anyone who might want to look at such pictures -- not exactly pleasant viewing, but they might be useful in some situations.\nI also found a page about Enzyme Potentiated Desensitization (EPD), which is a special kind of desensitization (by injection) against allergies:\nhttp://www.think.com/users/ephraim/epd.html\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 07:19:34 EDT From: Julia Subject: Wet Wraps & UV treatment\nThere is no medication included in the wet wrap. Wet wraps is just a double layer of plain cotton bandage (brand name Tubifast) and the bottom layer goes on soaked in plain warm tap water.\nHowever, before the wraps go on we put on topical steroids and moisturizer. We are using considerably less steroid cream than before we wet wrapped though.\nI'm interested to know how widespread this technique is. I know it's quite new in UK. Is it used in other parts of the world? And if so what sort of success has it had? It's been brilliant for our daughter but has anybody had a bad result from using it? Also our daughter is a rather skinny 8 year old. Have adults tried the technique?\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 07:47:42 -0400 From: Gary Subject: Wet Wraps & UV treatment\nI've used this technique with great success this year on the advice of my dermotologist. My approach is to apply a combination steroid/antibiotic zinc oxide based cream (a formula developed by my dermotologist) to the affected areas. Then put on a pair of long underwear (\"long johns\" to some; covering from ankles to to neckline) that have been soaked, and wringed out a little, in tap water. Then, since this outfit is somewhat cold and miserable, I put on a couple of jogging outfits on top. I then function normally like this, leaving the wet outfit on for about two hours per time. During chronic outbreaks, I do this about two or three times per day and, according to my experience, within 3 or 4 days, the skin is almost perfect. This is by far the best quick fix for severe eczema outbreaks I've found that doesn't involve taking oral steroids (prednisone). I've seen a dozen dermotologists over the years and the present one (trained at Mayo Clinic and Stanford) is the first to prescribe this wonderful, albeit temporary, cure.\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 09:26:41 -0400 From: Ralph Subject: Wet Wraps & UV treatment\nWould the wet wrap work without the steroids? (This question is for anyone with experience using wet wraps.)\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 12:46:15 EDT From: Julia Subject: Wet Wraps & UV treatment\nApparently wet wraps are beneficial for these reasons:\nThey act as a barrier, thus protecting skin from scratching.\nThey soothe the skin, thus reducing itching/scratching.\nThey keep the skin moist.\nThey make a mild steroid more effective somehow.\nSo the first three reasons are nothing to do with steroids.\nI note that Gary makes some similar arrangement using long johns and jogging suits which he finds effective. Improvement showed in 24 hours once we started wet wrapping and was considerable within 3 days and, on the whole, her skin has stayed good.\nAlthough I'm very enthusiastic about the technique I must also say that eczema does like to pop out somewhere and we found that with Esme her buttocks and shoulders, which were not wrapped, got eczema but this cleared after a week or so. But we don't wrap her face and that, at present, is the most difficult area.\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 12:55:16 -0400 From: Robert Subject: Wet Wraps & UV treatment\nI tried a \"home grown\" pseudo wet wrap routine on myself in bad eczema times by soaking pajamas and wearing them at night. I found it was a bit of a help but very uncomfortable. I only tried it for a few days. I think that it is analagous to wearing a bandage over a bad area with some cortisone which seems to promote rapid healing by concentrating the ointment and reducing the ability to physically impact the open area.\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 09:33:13 -0800 From: Ann Subject: wet wrapping\nI have done a lot of wet wrapping on myself. I slept in wet wraps, head to ankle, every night for about 10 months when I was in my 40s. It really improved the condition of the underlying skin (restores the moisture lost from inflammation), but the allergic rash was still there unless I zapped it with steroids.\nThe only adverse reaction I had were that my fingernails seemed to be disintegrating so I stopped wearing wet gloves. I quit the body wraps because of time constraints but continued the face, scalp and neck wraps for years. Unfortunately I learned how to use the semi-dry cotton T shirt that served as a head wrap (you breathe thru a sleeve) to abrade my jaw area while I slept. So I gave the whole thing up.\nI would advise plastic mattress and pillow covers to guard against mildew. I found that heavy cotton clothes held the water better than the medical wrapping stuff, but if it works for your child, keep it up! This is a wonderful thing you are doing for her. I hope her skin completely clears (most kids do outgrow it), but in any event, she will have nicer skin because of what you are doing.\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 15:32:56 -0400 From: Shelley Subject: hospital ER\nKris: Your experience at the hospital ER sounds awful. I know exactly what you mean about their infuriating ignorance. And on top of it, they assume YOU are ignorant too! When the truth is that you could teach them quite a bit about it. In those kinds of situations, I want to start screaming at the top of my lungs.\nI wonder what it would take for the medical community to finally GET IT about chronic cases like ours. Unfortunately, it often takes a tragedy for change to occur. Someone would have to come to a breaking point, get a gun, and start shooting in a doctor's office or hospital to get their attention. I'm not advocating this as a solution. It's just that their lack of concern is an outrage of that magnitude. I have had so many episodes where I've been treated the way Kristen describes. Those of us who have lived with this condition our entire lives are the only ones who seem to appreciate how much of a crisis it is. (Perhaps if we just shot at the ceiling.....)\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 15:32:49 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Shampoo\nHi Brenda, Until I get a diagnosis of this latest flare (photosensitivy, as far as I can tell now but have no definitive diagnosis yet), I may end up with my head in the bathroom sink. Showering and shampooing is so much more efficient, but how does one test these shampoos prior to use?\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 16:34:21 -0400 From: Stephen Subject: u.v treatment\nThe theory behind the U.V treatment is to burn off the outer eczema/infected skin and hopefully allow the new skin to come through. In our case this procedure is repeated a number of times to thicken the skin but we don't know what happens when the treatment finishes or if it is on-going treatment\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 16:08:44 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: clarification\nAnn, You are probably the most highly allergic person I have ever talked with. As for dust, it's so pervasive, how does one attempt to live without it? If one can afford a cleaning service, great. Only I certainly can't on a regular basis. And how does one get away from pollen? Or keep it away? There may be solutions, but most of them are so impractical as to be totally useless. Glad you are doing so much better for now.\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 15:59:59 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: scalp and genes\nAnn, I think you hit the nail on the head here--we ourselves are probably the only real key to research, but we have neither the time or the resources or whatever to pursue the real answers. Trouble is, the answers may pertain to only one person and never to anyone else. We are defeated before we even begin. Eczema has to be the curse of Job.\nAs of today, I am better. Am using 0.1% hydrocortisone in white petrol creme all over (so I am a greasball but not a 'dirty' one!), and 500 mg of Atarax. The Atarax knocked me out so I could at least sleep, and they took 2 biopsies off my back, so go back to get stiches out next week. Surprisingly, the UW derm dr seemed to recognize my condition as \"photo- something\" and \"classic\" something, but I may have gotten 5 seconds of his time. Very little conversation between patient and Dr. I find this trend disgusting. He asked me if I had ever been hospitalized before, and if my hair was natural color. (It is still dark brown without coloring, lest I had used something on it.) Never asked me about shampoo use or what else I might have used on it. So I still have no diagnosis, but I mean to get one before this is over. No instructions about when to stop the cortisone with petrol (I'm cold turkey cortisone now, or was before this happened).\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 16:48:07 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Wet Wraps & UV treatment\nGlad to hear wet wraps prove so beneficial. My mother used to apply something similar when I was a kid--you wouldn't want to hear what we used! But the face is the most difficult area to treat with any kind of compresses, etc.\nWhen one is a kid whose parent applies all the trappings, it is workable. But if you are an adult trying to play doctor to yourself, it becomes highly impractical and mostly nonworkable, and dissatisfactory to boot.\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 11:55:34 -1000 From: Alix Subject: Sort of like Wet Wraps\nI've had eczema all of my 43 years, its been mild, its been severe, and its been almost gone! Reading about recent discussions on wet wraps reminded me of a treatment I have used in the past when my eczema was real bad. After applying cortisone cream, instead of wrapping the effected area with wet cloths, I wrap the area with plastic wrap (handiwrap, saranwrap, etc) and leave it on overnight. This method was recommended to me by a dermatologist years ago--I still use it once in a great while when things get out of control.\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 20:54:47 -0500 From: Gayle Subject: Too many blankets/UV Treatments\nI wonder if candida infections are caused by eczema treatment rather than cause eczema. The cortisone would make a nice growth environment for the candida. I have found also, following a candida diet has made improvements in my eczema. Candida yeast infections are very hard to treat and many MD's don't even believe in them, so getting advice from them can't be counted on.\nEgyptian Cotton sheets are available at any large department store. Here I have gotten them at Macy's, Bloomingdales, and Dayton's. Egyptian cotton fibers are much longer and thinner than most varieties allowing them to have more fibers per inch (320). That makes it feel nicer than silk. By the way, they seem to last much longer than other sheets.\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 22:03:09 -0400 From: Gary Subject: Sort of like Wet Wraps\nThis technique multiplies by several times the rate at which the steroid is absorbed by your skin and hence by your body. Consequently, while it can be a good approach for a short period of time (say, less than two weeks), it is not good over the long term because you can actually absorb a huge amount of steroid systemically. The technique is what derms call an occlusive seal. Incidentally, my understanding is that a wet wrap is considerably less sealing than an occlusive seal because, with a wet wrap, the skin can still \"breath\", at least as the moisture evaporates. Consequently, in contrast to what someone said earlier, a wet wrap is not analogous to a band aid or occlusive seal. I believe the latter could actually produce some fairly significant systemic side effects if done too much over a longish period of time. Can anyone respond more authoritatively on the difference between wet wraps and occlusive seals? My knowledge is based mostly on hearsay and inferences.\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 19:42:00 GMT From: Stephen Subject: Aloe vera\nHas anyone tried using Aloe vera gel internally or externally for eczema? I have just started to take it by mouth and would be interested to hear of any other experiences.\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 20:30:42 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: Shampoo\n>>Showering and shampooing is so much more efficient,<<\nSure, but it seems a lot easier than trying to protect your body with a plastic raincoat under the shower and risking bits sneaking down the collar.\nWould a small patch test of the shampoo on a regularly sensitive bit of skin help do you think?\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 09:10:23 -0400 From: Christopher Subject: Wet Wraps\n25 years ago I was admitted to the major skin treatment hospital in London UK with a really bad flare up of eczema. The treatment included something called among us patients, mummyfying!\nAfter a supervised bath, ointment was applied, then we were wrapped in gauze bandages that had been soaked in zinc oxide. They were bright yellow and made a squishy sound as they were unwrapped. Then a layer of regular crepe bandages and then the tubigauze bandage over that. We did look like mummies!\nHowever, the treatment did work for me for a while. I think the name of the bandages was Quinaband. I know it provided excellent moisturizaton and helped the skin absorb more of the topical ointments that were applied before the bandages.\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 09:50:50 -0400 From: Ralph Subject: Too many blankets/UV Treatments\nI have been experiencing an unpleasant itching episode in the last few days. It's what is euphemistically called \"jock itch\" -- that is, itching of the male genital areas. (I suppose this can happens to women too, but I don't know for sure). It seems to be yeast (\"fungal\") in many cases. I started using an antifungal powder spray, which has helped this in the past, and it seems to be getting better.\nI don't think this could have been caused by any eczema treatment, since I haven't been using any treatments in the last few weeks, and I don't currently have eczema in that area anyway.\nMy dermatologist has recently been prescribing antifungal medicine by mouth along with antibiotics. If the spray doesn't fix the problem, I may try taking some of that medication.\n(Parenthetical note: I'm a bit confused by the fact that \"yeast\" and \"fungus\" seem to be synonomous in this realm of human pathology. Yeast to me is the white stuff that makes bread rise. Fungus is what a mushroom is. I must confess that I don't see the connection.)\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 18:37:35 +-100 From: Simon Subject: Fungus and Yeast\nCurious, I looked in the shorter OED.\nFungus\nAny of a large division of organisms, including mushrooms, toadstools, moulds, rusts, yeasts and constituents of lichens, which lack chlorophyll, reproduce as cryptograms(!) and grow on and obtain nutriment from organic matter.\nA growth of a soft or spongy diseased tissue on a surface, as a tumour etc\nA growth of facial hair, a beard (slang)\nYeast\nAny of the unicellular ascomycetous fungi of the genus Saccharomyces, capable of converting water into alchohol and Carbon Dioxide; a yellowish-grey preparation of such a fungus used esp. as a fermenting agent or to raise bread dough etc. b. A unicellular fungus in which vegetative reproduction takes place by budding or fission.\nFroth or foam, esp on new or fermenting beer.\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 12:46:04 -0700 From: Amy Subject: Aloe vera\nI have been using aloe vera, the drinkable kind, on my skin. It burns like heck but heals too. I am now using a lotion that is 84% aloe vera since my eczema is temporarily under control, thanks, sort of, to the oral steroids I am on for a while.\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 12:11:11 -0800 From: Ann Subject: dust control & wet wraps\nAny allergist can tell you about dust control. It can mean a major lifestyle change. Plastic covers on mattress, box springs and pillows. Frequent hot washing of all bedding. No carpets or unwashable rugs; no unwashable curtains. No open bookshelves or stacks of paper; No stuffed (or overstuffed) chairs. As few knick-knacks as possible unless you want to dust them frequently. Frequent vacuuming with a specially filtered vacuum.\nAs there are 3 of us here who are highly allergic, our house is exemplary (except we do have one couch). It took me a while to get everything done, but it's worth it because even if I don't get the vacuuming done on time, there's very little dust anywhere. And people always exclaim how clean and open our house is. Only later do they realize that there's not a comfortable chair in the place! But that's OK with me because we are all so busy that we don't sit for long anyhow.\nAlso, there are desensitization shots for dust mites. The mildew shots are usually not given because people have such heavy flares from them. So we also did mildew control (mainly install fans in kitchen and BR to get rid of extra moisture).\nThe main reason I kept the wet wrapping going for so long is that, for me anyhow, wet clothing on my skin completely kills the itch. So it was much easier for me to get to sleep in wet rather than dry clothing.\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 15:23:03 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Sort of like Wet Wraps\nI've heard of the of the plastic wrap idea--that would drive me crazy inside 15 minutes--the stuff doesn't breathe. It does force penetration of the meds applied into the skin, but the other effect is worse than the remedy--for me, at least.\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 16:22:23 -0400 From: Stephen Subject: wet wraps without steriod\nIn our experience we currently are wet wrapping our son with diprobase and very occasionally applying steroid cream on the bad areas when they flare up - along with the wraps he is also recieving U.V treatment which we believe is also helping.\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 15:25:23 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Too many blankets/UV Treatments\nHas anyone ever tried growing candida in cortisone in a Petri dish? I'm not a researcher, so have no idea what this would involve.\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 15:33:30 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Shampoo\nNot sure about patch-testing shampoo, since usually the skin on my arms vs my face vs my scalp usually reacts differently. My face is most sensitized due to cortisone overuse. I can have a bad facial flare without any scalp involvement whatsoever. And what duration? I'm one of those 24-hour or longer responders. Putting a blob of shampoo on my head for 24 hours isn't really true to life, since shampoo is rarely applied without water in some ratio.\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 16:07:59 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: dust control & wet wraps\nHi Ann, Your efforts are truly remarkable and sound very attractive! It's not that I don't know about dust-free living, but I find the idea of no curtains or rugs repulsive. I have the bedding covers, just haven't gotten motivated to put them on. Funny thing is, I have good times and bad times whether I do the dust-free thing or not. The forced air furnace/AC makes things worse, I think. And I'm a book reader of long standing, so no comfortable chairs to read in is unthinkable. But your statement about wet being more comfortable than dry gives me pause. I will keep that in mind when I'm in trouble.\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 22:53:52 -0700 From: Chuck Subject: Fungal/yeast infection\nRalph, as someone pointed out, yeast and fungus are one and the same. An antifungal is exactly the right thing to do for a fungus/yeast infection, and antibiotics are exactly the wrong thing to do.\nAntibiotics CAUSE yeast infections by killing the beneficial bacteria in your body, which opens the door for fungus/yeast to replace the \"good\" bacteria. Yeast infections of the colon, genitals, and skin are a common side effect of heavy doses of antibiotics. That's why some GP's prescribe an antifungal and lactobacillus supplements along with antibiotics. The antifungal kills the yeast, and the lactobacillus is a good bacteria that crowds out the fungus in the body and prevents it from growing back.\nDate: Fri, 21 Jun 1996 20:02:07 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: Shampoo\nCould you use one of the non-soap soaps on your hair? Whatever doesn't upset your body should work on your hair. The detergent in shampoo seems to be particularly damaging, but our grandmothers managed without it (probably used Sunlight soap), so I guess we can, especially if you use conditioner.\nDate: Fri, 21 Jun 1996 07:58:05 -0400 From: Donna Subject: Unmentionable itching\nYeast IS a fungus -- unicellular, of the genus Saccharomyces. It makes bread rise by fermenting the carbohydrates (which is why it needs sugar). The commercial type of yeast one buys in the store for baking is really a meal impregnated with yeast cells.\nFWIW, yeast is very high in B vitamins. ;-)\nDate: Fri, 21 Jun 1996 09:48:57 PST From: Wren Subject: Computer and Office Related Itching\nA coworker sent me this bit from in the on-line Risks Forum (comp.risks).\nAnn, it made me think of you. Do you work in an office that has to be kept clean? I work in a cubicle on a large open floor. The surfaces are dusty, and floor only cursorily vacuumed. Probably doesn't help.\nFrom the electronic edition of the Swedish newspaper, Svenska Dagbladet (14 Jun 1996) http://www.svd.se/svd/ettan/X0002_Damm_och_dator.html (My rough translation and summary).\nWorkers using video display terminals in dusty and poorly cleaned offices had increased risk for skin damage, as shown by a study by the Norwegian \"national work environment institute\" (statens arbetsmilj=F6institut). The study showed how dust particles in combination with static electricity caused skin irritation in people working with computer displays. ...\nBy wiping the screens with a special ionic solution and, at the same time, grounding the hard disk, the static electricity was led away from the apparatus. The result was a noticeable lessening of skin irritation. \"There were on average 20% fewer skin problems when the static electricity field disappeared,\" said Dr. Knut Skulberg who, together with Dr. Knut Skyberg was responsible for the project. In the control group where the ground lead was not used, there was no noticable change.\nA careful analysis of the indoor environment in the offices showed how a number of additional factors were affected by static electricity. -- If there is a lot of dust, skin problems worsened. Less dust meant less skin reaction.\nThe researchers also discovered that few displays had strong static electricity fields directly in front of the screen. Instead, they measured the greatest values along the side and above the displays.\nNorwegian studies show that 16% of people who work frequently with computer displays have had some form of skin irritation, primarily redness, itching, and dry skin.\nDate: Fri, 21 Jun 1996 10:02:18 PST From: Wren Subject: Shampoo\nBrenda's idea is a good one. I've been using a grapefruit extract non-soap for months. I forget the name of it, but can get it for you if you are interested. I buy it at my local health food store, and it may even be sold in bulk at some.\nDate: Fri, 21 Jun 1996 18:25:40 -0400 From: Andrew Subject: hope/?hair\nJust wanted to thank everyone for being so open and honest. I became involved after a hospitalization in April and I do believe that this list is helping to save my life. I cannot believe how the medical community treats us at times.\nI keep telling myself I am my inner person and not my skin. I am trying to start a support group in my area and would you believe that a few Docs have said to me \"I cannot see why you would give people false hope\" or \" I really don't think it is needed\".\nI then tell them my \"horror\" story and try to be polite, but I can't stop picturing them with the devil himself roasting marshmallows!!! I have run an ad in the local paper and sent out letters to local derms, but have only received one response (she is a lovely and wonderful contact and we already have given each other much support). My husband of 1 year needs support too since this thing resurfaced only after he placed the ring on my finger. Any suggestions for getting to more patients would be helpful.\nAlso-- quick question- I am using Aquaphor on my face and chest and it has worked into my hair at night. I CAN NOT GET IT OUT! I am now a real grease ball. ANY SUGGESTIONS???? Thank you again folks.\nDate: Fri, 21 Jun 1996 23:23:00 +-100 From: Simon Subject: re. Computer and Office Related Itching\nAlso, the humidity near to a VDU is very low and this has a significant drying effect on the skin. Unfortunately there's not much that can be done about this (anti static/radiation filters in front of the screen aren't very effective in this regard).\nI have two VDUs at my desk, I always turn off the one I'm not using.\nPS. I've discovered to my cost that I'm highly allergic to cleaning products. The way I've combat this is to having a sign 'Please do not polish this desk/computer/phone etc'. I wipe my phone and computer with a damp cloth every morning, just in case ;-)\nDate: Fri, 21 Jun 1996 15:57:05 PST From: Wren Subject: Chinese medicine & herbs & food allergies\nSince, as most of you know, the Chinese herbs have really done the trick for me, I'm a real advocate. My Dr. diagnosed my condition as excess wind and heat, and as mentioned, recommended that I not eat seafood, beef, and any fruits containing citrus or having bumpy skin, especially berries and pineapple.\nAlso, I probably have some food allergies going on. Since last November I've been eating a restricted diet recommended by my homeopathic allergist. Among the items were no dairy, sugar, fruits (as they contain sugar), wheat and gluten containing grains, yeast-containing and fermented foods (tofu, vinegar, soy sauce).\nSince I've been feeling so much better I decided to throw hell to the wind and in the last 2 weeks ate pizza, spaghetti, bread, cookies, salad dressing, and anything else I wanted. Except seafood, beef, and fruit with bumpy skin.\nWhat happened was that my itching did increase some, maybe 15-20%, which was livable. But interestly, I became sluggish and drowsy throughout the day every day. Even though I was sleeping well, I just wanted to sleep more. Had no desire, no motivation, no get up and go, no urge to exercise. Just felt like sleeping all the time. Have returned to a better diet and am feeling better. Now I have to clean myself up, then add items one at a time to find out what the offending item or items might be. After that I don't know what I'll do. Either just keep these items out of my diet, or perhaps look into desensitization.\nAccording to the Chinese diet, I'm not supposed to eat spicy food, including all peppers. This is the hardest thing for me to say no to. I like that salsa on my carnitas (roast pork) tacos.\nBye from the land of eat and itch.\nDate: Fri, 21 Jun 1996 22:44:28 -0400 From: Thomas Subject: New subscriber\nMy 3 month old son has eczema covering his entire body. This poor child is very uncomfortable and especially at night. After reading all I can about eczema, he does not fall into typical patterns of just behind the knees and crease in the arms. The typical solutions of creams ect. appear to make matters worse. Anything blocking the pores causes him problems. I truly believe he has a digestive disorder since he is allergic to everything. Mothers milk, cow formula, soy formula, hypo-allergenic formulas and now raw goats milk. Anyone have experience with this?\nDate: Fri, 21 Jun 1996 21:45:25 -0800 From: Ann Subject: misc comments\nMy computer is in a virtually dust free environment and I don't spend much time at it these days. When I worked in an office, I don't remember having much skin trouble, but it's good to know about the potential problem.\nI too had an increase in skin trouble when I got married. Looking back now, I bet it was the wall to wall carpets (full of dog and cat hair), the 2 cats we adopted, and the heavy mildew level that bothered me rather than my change in marital status. So tell your spouse not to feel guilty!\nI too have the chronically greasy hair problem, but any moisturizer that doesn't mess up the hair isn't heavy enough for my skin. I used to fret about this, but one of the benefits of being older is that comfort rules over looks.\nThomas, I am sorry to hear that your baby is so badly affected. I was severe all over for several years starting at 3 months. So far, I've never been that bad again. My mother refused to experiment with food elimination. I wish she had and maybe I would have gotten better sooner and stayed clearer forever. Have you tried elemental formulas? (They were suggested for my son at one point when he seemed to be allergic to everything; but he got stronger before we needed them). I think they are by prescription only and are expensive but as a last resort, until your baby gets stronger, you might ask your doctor.\nDate: Sat, 22 Jun 1996 17:35:32 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: Water\nI've been mulling over an earlier thread about water, having just smelled the reek of chlorine when I turned the tap on. The domestic water supply is fairly heavily laden with chemicals I imagine, chlorine and fluoride being only two. Some sensitive skins may be reacting to these and I wonder if it would help to install a filter. I don't mean the type that many of us use for drinking water, but one that goes into the main system so all the water in the house is filtered. I'm very vague about how these work - they must surely use some kind of holding tank system but I can't quite picture how the water pressure would be maintained. However, I do remember seeing them advertised so they're not a figment of my imagination.\nNaturally you wouldn't want to leap into this kind of expense without good justification, so perhaps it would be possible to trial it by filtering some water with drinking water equipment and just trying it on your face and hands for a while.\nPerhaps just another crackpot idea, but while there's no cure for eczema you have to keep trying to think of measures to alleviate it.\nDate: Sat, 22 Jun 1996 11:17:35 +-100 From: Simon Subject: Screens and things\nIf I know I'm going to be sitting in front of screens all day I avoid wearing contact lenses - because they dry out within a couple of hours.\nWork makes my skin worse - but what are you going to do?\nDate: Sat, 22 Jun 1996 12:47:12 EDT From: Michael Subject: Water\nI have installed a water filter here in my home. It is quite simple; it's about 9 inches long and 2 inches thick and is plugged in line with the drinking water tap. It has been in use for a year or two (the filter has to be changed evry three months) and seems to do its job properly. As far as I can tell, it consists of a `block' of carbon, but there may be other items in it as well. It removes all traces of chlorine smell and gives us more confidence in what we are drinking. However, it has made no difference to my eczema!\nDate: Sat, 22 Jun 1996 12:07:26 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: hope/?hair\nIf your face and neck, ears, etc., are okay, try using a healthy ordinary shampoo that you feel confident about. Most will cut grease very well. You might try blotting the Aquaphor up as much as you can first with soft paper towels, and then use shampoo. I do know Prell cuts grease like nothing else, but I don't know what effect it may have on your scalp. I used Prell to get tar off the lapel of a coat once!\nDate: Sat, 22 Jun 1996 12:12:25 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: re. Computer and Office Related Itching\nI must be one of the few who prefer a dry environment to humid. But I'm also careful about cleaning products--mostly the commercial ones. I use vinegar and diluted bleach products for cleaning at home, but use mostly Windex at work for cleaning. It seems to be the least offensive to my skin as well as my nose.\nDate: Sat, 22 Jun 1996 12:19:16 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Chinese medicine & herbs & food allergies\nWren, I assume you are keeping a log of your foods/times/reactions. Any elimination diet wil produce reactions. Like my year without dairy foods which, when resumed, produced an intolerance to lactase--a definitive response that I could not ignore, nor had any illusions about. Food diaries are really hard to maintain (I think) and then try and figure out which if any was the probable culprit for a specific response. I always found them to be futile (by and large), but good luck!\nDate: Sat, 22 Jun 1996 12:28:56 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Shampoo\nAbout greased up hair: In the 70's when I had bad scalp problems, I would wash my hair at night, load up on the meds to my scalp (which made my hair icky again, sleep with my head covered, and then in the morning when I went to work, I put on a wig!!\nDon't laugh! I really like wigs! Now they are very airy (cap part), and fluffy and never go flat, and are washable in detergent--after which they can be air dried over the tub. One of my favorites cost me $30. They come in all styles and colors, still not expensive. But try them on at a shop so you know what colors are good for you--shadings, etc., since it's hard to know out of a catalog. There's more than one way to skin a cat (ugh).\nDate: Sun, 23 Jun 1996 12:40:25 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: Water\nI didn't mean for drinking but for washing. That's why I referred to a total-house system. A number of people have commented on the effects that just plain (but not pure) water have had on their skin.\nDate: Sun, 23 Jun 1996 17:22:19 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: Itchy races\nDoes anyone know if the eczema battle is drawn up along racial lines? I've never noticed any Polynesians with it, but that may be because it's less obvious on a darker skin. However, it may also be because paler skin reacts more to U.V. etc. Can anyone cite any research?\nP.S. If anyone wants to stop their skin from drying out, let me sell you a plane ticket. It hasn't stopped raining for one minute the whole weekend!\nDate: Sun, 23 Jun 1996 02:38:11 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Itchy races\nMy derm dr says eczema is patriarchal civilization's disease, and that it's mostly our lifestyle--industrialized--tho we are killing that misnomer off these days with high tech. Have no knowledge of eczema or psoriasis in other races. I only met my first black people when I was 30!\nDate: Sun, 23 Jun 1996 07:46:25 -0400 From: Ralph Subject: Unmentionable itching\nMy eczema is also under good control right now. Is that a coincidence, or some sort of connection, I wonder? I do think I may possibly have caused the jock-itch by wearing some too-tight underwear.\nDate: Sun, 23 Jun 1996 15:24:27 -0400 From: Christopher Subject: Quinaband Bandages\nDoes anyone have a supplier and price of the bandages called Quinaband? It is a crepe bandage soaked in zinc oxide. The Dr's in the U.K. used it on me 25 years ago and it seems to me that these are a lot easier than wet wrapping. The quinaband bandage goes on then that is covered with a regular bandage then the whole lot gets tubi-gauze bandages over that to hold it all in place.\nAlso, has anyone used Hydroxyzine or Polaramine tablets? What doses do they take and did they get any weird stomach side effects? I look forward to your replies.\nDate: Sun, 23 Jun 1996 15:33:39 -0700 From: Keith Subject: Hydroxyzine\nI use the Hydroxyzine tablets 10-mg. No stomach problems, but they make me feel pretty drowsy the next day. I only take them when I am really itchy. Has anyone tryed Zonalon Cream 5%? Its good for small areas, otherwise it makes you pretty drowsy.\nDate: Sun, 23 Jun 1996 19:38:53 -0400 From: Gary Subject: Hydroxyzine\nI find that if you take Hydroxyzine for a few days, the drowsiness side effect wears off. But different people may react differently. My derm maintains that the best solution for itchiness is to use a steroid ointment or cream in the affected areas sufficiently that the itchiness effect does not arise. However, some are loathe to use a steroid ointment/cream.\nDate: Sun, 23 Jun 1996 21:04:24 -0400 From: Ralph Subject: Zonalon\nThe following material about Zonalon is from the Eczema List non-automated period (8/95 - 11/95), archives for which are not yet available on the server:\n>>The topical medication doxepin (Zonalon) appears to mute the persistent itchy rash of eczema, often within 24 hours after application. In this study, side effects--including stinging, burning, and drowsiness--were generally mild and tended to subside with continued treatment. [ Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, 10/94 ]. Does anyone have any experience with this medication?<<\n>>My Dr suggested I try it for itch. I did. It works. Price: made my throat dry and made me drowsy. I put some of it on face, where the skin is thinner , and it works but it knocked me out. My reaction came within 6 hrs, not 24. Everyone's different. It may work for you. I use it only when I know I can deal with the consequences or if the rubber bands don't work. I wonder how children and teens react to it.<<\n>>TIP# 4 There is a \"new\" prescription cream called Zonalon which helps stop itch. Side effect: it make you drowsy and dry in mouth. Best time to use it is bedtime. See your dermatologist for samples. I don't know if kids should be using it.<<\n>> Zonalon is the brand name of an \"antipruitic\" (anti-itch) cream manufactured by Genderm Corp. This cream is another form of doxepin hydrochloride, the latter which is taken is pill form to manage itch. Doxepin is also used for psychotherapeutic reasons. As I said in an earlier communication the cream does work for me; but I get drowsy, have a dryness in my mouth, and experience a sort of hangover. The stuff is potent: the active ingredient comprises 5% of the cream. It is applied on the itch spot. Of course, it works faster on thin skin than it does on thincker skin. <<\nDate: Sun, 23 Jun 1996 19:13:20 -0700 From: Keith Subject: Climate and Eczema\nMy derm doc has mentioned several times that I would be better off living in a warmer climate.I have noticed that when on a trip to Mexico a few years ago my eczema seemed to be a lot better. Anyone else have thoughts on this.\nDate: Mon, 24 Jun 1996 18:21:56 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: Climate and Eczema\nIt can get pretty warm here during the summer but I've found that this seems to increase the eczema rather than reduce it. My own experience is that heat is the last thing thing you want, but having said that, someone I know gets relief from her eczema by taking a weekly sauna. For what it's worth, A has a fairly bad record for eczema and asthma. However, who's to say what the cause might be. High humidity? Too much pollen? It all sounds rather too unsbstantiated to risk packing your bags.\nDate: Mon, 24 Jun 1996 09:36:52 PST From: Wren Subject: Water\nLast year I installed a shower head with built-in filter into the shower, and it the filtered water is definitely less irritating to my skin. We have a built-in filter in the kitchen sink to provide us with chemical free drinking water. All the other taps give us regular water, which is fine with us.\nThe shower head filter supposedly lasts some years - the exact number escapes me now. I bought it a Wild Oats health food store in Berkeley, and have seen them advertised in health catalogs. I bet different countries have different piping standards, and our standard is undoubtedly in inches rather than the more practical centimeters.\nDate: Mon, 24 Jun 1996 09:52:39 PST From: Wren Subject: Food Diary\nNo, I haven't kept a food diary, but keep sort of a running log in my head. It's a good idea though, and I think I'll use it when I start experimenting again. My itching has definitely lessened with the reversion to my former diet.\nDate: Mon, 24 Jun 1996 14:22:43 -0400 From: Shelley Subject: Climate and Eczema\nI'm not sure if I mentioned this before, but I have become aware of a problem that exacerbates my eczema. My brain seems to have difficulty sensing the temperature of the rest of my body. Because my brain doesn't signal \"Too hot!\" I don't take appropriate action to get cooler until my body has already reacted with a visible itch or rash. Only when I have the visual cues do I realize \"Oh, I'm hot.\" My friend Robert has noticed this because we have been together many times now when his brain alerts him to the heat and he takes off a sweater or moves to a cooler location and he sees that I have not taken similar action. He'll say \"Aren't you hot?\" and I'll reply No, I'm not hot. And then a little while later he'll say \"Look at your skin. You ARE hot, it's getting all blotchy.\" And only then will I realize he's right. My brain signals work fine when the heat is quite intense. The problem is when it's a subtle heat that apparently my sensitive skin recognizes before my brain does. This may add to the overheating at night problem too.\nDate: Mon, 24 Jun 1996 19:06:02 -0400 From: Chuck Subject: Fungal/yeast infection\nYou can get Lactobacillus at any health food store and even some pharmacies. The best type to get is a combination of Lactobacillus and Bifidus. One is good for the upper digestive tract and the other for the lower (I forget which is which). Also, if you can find a brand with an enteric coating, that's better too. It delivers the capsule whole into the intestine so that the stomach doesn't digest the bacteria as though it were a food.\nJust FYI, I used to have itchy patches on my hands and feet that had a different appearance than the eczema on the rest of my body. It seemed to respond to topical antifungal creams, so that was a tipoff to me that I had a yeast infection. After I went on the full antifungal regime, not only did my eczema improve dramatically all over my body, but also it disappeared completely from my hands and feet.\nDate: Mon, 24 Jun 1996 22:06:19 -0400 From: Christopher Subject: Hydroxyzine\nI've tried Zonalon but I find that it stings really bad when it goes in a cut and then doesn't seem to relieve the itch. Hydroxyzine seems to be pretty mild and I guess you can take 4 or 5 a day. Does your doctor allow that?\nDate: Mon, 24 Jun 1996 21:58:57 -0400 From: Ralph Subject: dust control\nAnn, I've done some of the anti-dust-mite program: covers on the mattresses and pillows, moving books out of our bedroom, switching to lint-free tissues (Marcal), and a general attempt to reduce dust. It definitely seems to have helped. My hand eczema is much better (not gone, but currently not very bothersome), and my allergy symptoms are significantly reduced. All in all, a big win. I definitely recommend it. Thanks for bringing this up. By the way, the mattress and box spring covers are considered to be one of the best and most cost-effective medical interventions for asthma patients.\nFor anyone who doesn't already have this information, you can order The Allergy Relief Catalog from National Allergy Supply by calling (800) 522-1448 from the USA or Canada, or by writing to:\nNational Allergy Supply, Inc.\n"}, {"score": 965.8831, "uuid": "d33db418-f133-503c-83e8-c724a17b5688", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1509wb-36-26567", "target_hostname": "www.eczema.ndo.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.eczema.ndo.co.uk/log9604.htm", "page_rank": 1.2093391e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Eczema</em> Mailing List - April 1996 Archive", "snippet": "<em>What</em> happens with my <em>eczema</em>, once it <em>is</em> set off and &quot;settled&quot;, <em>the</em> causes multiply and <em>the</em> body gets out of balance.", "explanation": null, "document": "Edited Archives\nApril 1996 Eczema Mailing List Archive\nThis file contains most of the traffic on the Eczema Mailing List during April 1996.

I find that very interesting! Actually, myself, I don't smoke. But,except for the harm the smoking might do to you, I'm glad we have at least one smoker in our group because only you can answer a question I've pondered for a long time: IS SMOKING OR SCRATCHING HARDER TO QUIT? I often feel very weak compared to people I know who have quit smoking, because I've tried to quit scratching so many times - never successfully. Nicotine is supposedly the most addictive drug there is. Yet when I watch smokers smoke, they don't appear to be in orgasmic ecstasy like I am when I scratch. So which, for you, is the bigger rush: scratching or smoking?\nDate: Mon, 1 Apr 1996 15:51:12 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: scalp treatment\nYes, scalp eczema is a real problem. I use Temovate scalp application 0.05%. I also want to mention a tip that Ann told me years ago: to use the smallest amount of shampoo possible and make sure that you rinse thoroughly. Since using less shampoo (just a few drops) and rinsing more than I used to, my scalp has improved. The temperature of the water is also important, the colder the better, in my opinion. I also use a series of three shampoos. I find that if I use the same one every day, my scalp reacts. I tried various combinations until I found a group that seems to work in a series of using a different one each day. But periodically I have to change one or all the shampoos. So be prepared to go through the trial and error period over and over again. I seem to be able to live with a group of shampoos for about 6 months before needing to change, but I'm sure everyone has a different reaction time.\nDate: Mon, 1 Apr 1996 18:06:14 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: talking face to face\nSamantha: I'm so glad you found someone to meet with in person. This online network is great, but talking face to face is even better. I like the combination of daily eczema-mail and periodic face-to-face visits. I urge everyone out there who hasn't met someone else with eczema in person to ask their doctor, and other dermatologists in your area, to give your number to other patients.\nIt's amazing when you see with your own eyes someone who looks like you. Or they may not. Out of all the eczema folks I've met in person, only one whose skin had the exact same physical appearance. \"So that's what I look like,\" I thought. The others were all slightly different. But it was close enough to recognize people in our clan. Be aware, though, that you may have expectations about developing a close connection with these people. Just because you have ezcema in common doesn't mean that you'll have everything else in common too. Yes, it's exciting to create a friendship based on the shared struggle with this disease, but be careful of expecting too much. Just because someone else has ezcema doesn't necessarily mean that they'll be your soulmate....\nDate: Tue, 2 Apr 1996 14:15:49 +0930 From: Samantha Subject: smoking\nI would definately say that smoking is easier to give up than scratching. The nicotine withdrawal only lasts about 40 hours but the urge to scratch is constant.\nScratching is like a relief and sometimes (as has been discussed on the list) and almost orgasmic feeling. Smoking, on the other hand is simply a topping up of nicotine which your body cries out for when the levels drop too much. Not much of a \"rush\" at all.\nDate: Tue, 2 Apr 1996 14:15:56 +0930 From: Samantha Subject: How I am today/face to face\nWas what I found great/interesting was looking at Alicia (who is going through a pretty bad bout at the moment) and thinking - hey, it doesn't look so bad.\nI have been thinking about this and wondering whether these thoughts were because I am so used to seeing *my own* eczema that someone else's would not seem terrible or whether we feel that our own eczema is so awful to the non-eczema world that we exaggerate our own ugliness?\nDid I make any sense there?\nI think that I do sometimes exaggerate my skin's ugliness and think that people notice it more that they do. I mean, like I look at myself in the mirror at a distance of about 2 cm seeing every bit of flakey skin, evey tiny eruption and think that this is how the world sees me but no-one out there in the day to day world gets that close to me so they would never see my skin up that close.\nBy the way - I had a horrid night scratching scratching scratching and tore all my arms and stomach up. I kept waking up and scratching, getting up to pace up and down, calming down, going to sleep, waking up to scratch, getting up to pace...and on and on. What a night.\nMy shower this morning was very painful with all of the raw skin and I feel a bit yukko.\nDate: Mon, 1 Apr 1996 21:26:04 -0800 From: Ann Subject: nicotine\nSamantha, Thank you for explaining the differences between the scratching and smoking habits. I don't feel so morally weak now. I think also that while a motivated-to-quit smoker can distance himself from nicotine ( I.eczema. throw out all smokes; don't hang out where people are smoking), I can't distance myself from my nails or from every single object that would make a good scratcher. I have periodically thrown out all Q-tips (to get control of ear canal scratching) only to find myself pilfering them from other people's bathrooms!\nDate: Tue, 2 Apr 1996 17:26:29 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: talking face to face and cortisone\nYou're lucky to have found a friend with whom you can commiserate. Was there anyone like that in your childhood, or a sympathetic parent or aunt or uncle?\nDate: Tue, 2 Apr 1996 17:28:39 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: smoking\nAnn, From the little I have read thus far in Grossbart's book Skin Deep--truly fantastic stuff--he says there is no such thing as using will power to stem itching. I'm seriously thinking about hypnosis, but he has lots of other methods to help oneself--which I haven't gotten to yet.\nDate: Tue, 2 Apr 1996 18:57:57 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: smoking/scratching & appearances\nSamantha and Ann: Both of you made good distinctions between trying to quit smoking and scratching, especially the parts about itching being a constant that never wears off and never being able to get away from our implements of destruction. I will remember to bring up those points when people find it hard to understand why scratching is such a problem.\nAnd Samantha: I know what you mean about seeing another person with eczema and thinking \"It doesn't look too bad.\" I remember that I was afraid to go to my first eczema group meeting because I thought I would be repulsed by everyone's skin and was afraid that I'd feel even more disgusting to identify myself as part of a group of horrible-looking people. But I had the same reaction you did, thinking, gee, they don't look too horrible to be seen with. When I discussed my fear with the group, it turned out that most of them had had the same fear the night before.\nDate: Wed, 3 Apr 1996 10:21:56 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: face to face\nI have been wondering about that. My only facial involvement has been occasionally on my eyelids and a little bit of roughness on cheeks, and even with that it's pretty hard, maybe impossible, to be objective about one's own appearance.\nAlthough there is one way I have found, actually, to do that: videotape. When I see myself entirely \"from the outside\" on a tape, I get a much clearer idea what I really look like. Enough so that I'm getting used to my appearance, including the shock of being... But I digress.\nWhat I wanted to get at is that I wonder if some of us with facial eczema are feeling worse than we actually look. I do know one man professionally whose face is always red, in varying degrees. I don't know for sure whether this is eczema or something else. But it has no effect on my interaction with him, nor have I ever mentioned it.\nDate: Wed, 3 Apr 1996 10:26:45 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: scalp treatment\nI never have been hypnotized. Not sure I want to. Intriguing, but scary.\nDate: Wed, 3 Apr 1996 12:36:14 -0300 From: Justin Subject: Greetings and Dyshidrosis\nIt's truly comforting to know that a group like this exists on the net and I compliment all those who have helped make this happen.\nAs I guess is rather typical of most human beings my interest in eczema lies with my own skin problem which may or may not be eczema or a derivative thereof. Basically for about the last year or so, and for the first time in my life (age 43) I have developed very dry patches of skin on my thumb and my ring finger. These dry patches are only on the tips of those fingers. The conditions varies from very dry and (what appears to me to be very thin skin) to better times when the skin is thicker and I might even see some semblance to a finger print. Since I'm mostly \"printless\" on those fingers perhaps I should enroll in a safe and lock opening course! I'm sure there is work for someone like me!\nI've gone to two different dermatologists here and the first said categorically \"Dyshidrosis\" which according to my books, pretty much describes the problem. No known cure, use creams, cortico-steriods, don't rub the skin dry, relieve stress etc. I guess everyone on this list know that routine pretty well. The other dermatologist said \"maybe\" dyshidrosis but also possibly a contact allergy problem. I did the allergy patch tests which indicated an allergy to resins which are found in lots of plastics. Now I do hold my computer mouse with the effected hand for hours on end and more or less exactly where the problem lies. So I covered my fingers with a cloth for a month and unfortunately saw no improvement. I removed the cloths a week ago. However just yesterday I got this brilliant insight that although I had use cloths to cover my fingers, I possibly reversed the material during the month meaning that the outside was on the inside and perhaps the resins or chemicals got on the cloths and then did touch my fingers. So I guess there is a bit of hope that my problem is still the mouse. I'm not too convinced though but it does offer a bit of hope for another month. In the meantime I have switched hands for my mouse. No an easy job after so many years using my right for everything however well worth the effort.\nDoes anyone out there have any experience with anything similar to this problem? I've read a few good things about using Evening Primrose Oil on affected skin which seems to offer great help at least to a few eczema sufferers. I started using it a week ago with no immediate benefit but I understand one does not see results until after a month of use. I guess if Primrose Oil was so fantastic everyone would be using it.\nOne more thing, I've never lived in a tropical country before and believe me it is often very warm here. If this is eczema that I have, and as it did start shortly after arriving here, might it go away by moving to a colder climate? Or is that just wishful thinking? One does need to be optimistic with these things yet a dose of realism doesn't hurt either.\nWell that's my story. Thanks for listening. And naturally any and all suggestions, comments or the like are greatly welcome.\nDate: Wed, 3 Apr 1996 11:13:10 -0500 From: Alicia Subject: New subscriber\nI live in a tropical, monsoonal part of the world. Since I have been living here my eczema has been basically pretty awful. I had infantile eczema as a result - my mother said- of being fed cows milk by nursing staff at the hospital where I was born. That cleared up when I was about 3 - I don't actually remember ever having infantile eczema, I was just told about it, although I've always had asthma - not too bad but enough to be carrying a Ventolin around just in case.\nI've also always had dry flakey skin - especially in winter- and wrinkly palms which I believe is all part of the same syndrome, but it wasn't until I was about 19 that my eczema reoccurred. I was living in an old house probably filled with dustmite, and I was also working my way through Uni by waitressing at night. The eczema reappeared on my hands - which I thought was a result of doing too much washing up. Doctors had prescribed cortisone cream but because I was doing Biochem at Uni, and knew what they were, I tried to aviod using them. By the end of that year though my lower arms were a complete weepy mess and little spots had started coming up on other parts of my body. I then went on a month long summer holiday in the country and moved out of the inner city and all my eczema cleared up for 1 and a half years. I was pretty happy about that.\nIt came back again on my ankles got pretty bad but went away again when I went on a holiday to Bali. I moved up here 3 years ago and it came back on my lower arms, neck, face, knees. I got skin tested and reacted strongly to dustmite and grasses. I went on a desentisation treatment for dustmite and that nearly gave me a nervous breakdown. I was pretty bad before I went on it, but an absolutely tragic weepy mess coming up to the end of it. All my joints and all my exposed skin was just oozing. I cleared up a lot at the end of the treatment and still have boosters. The eczema however didn't entirely piss off, and I've just got half way through a desensitisation treatment for grasses before I stopped it I was getting the same reaction as I got with the dustmite treatment, and basically didn't want to go through with it again.\nI'm leaving this place in a couple of months because eczema is dominating my every waking thought - besides being painful and uncomfortable. Because I've never relied too heavily on cortisones, and because I've cleared up from bad eczema before, I feel pretty confident that I can do it again, although I know it will take time - like a couple of months in the right environment - which isn't here.\nI was wondering whether anyone knows of any research involving hormones and the eczema. My skin is a lot better just after a period and my sister's mild eczema cleared up when she was pregnant.\nI also was wondering whether the metabolism of cholesterol has anything to do with immune responses. Cholesterol is the precusor to the body's own corticosteriods, sex hormones, and glucosteroids. It is metabolised in the adrenals and ovaries by a phytochrome called P450 which also help detoxify the body. P450 if inactived incorrectly however, can also stimulate a cancer.\nEveryone knows that people with Atopic Disease have too much IgE and that there is an over reaction to stimuli - but I haven't heard much about the \"off\" switch to the stimuli -ie the utilisation and levels of the bodies own cortisones. There are a lot of people who have allergies - but no extra inflammation or allergenic symptoms so I was just wondering whether there was a problem in people with AD with the metabolism of cholesterol which seems to make sense why allergies, cortisone treatment, diabetes and low hormone (especially female hormone) levels resulting in PMT, post natal depression etc.. can be linked. Lack , varying or low levels of cortisone also results in a thinning of the skin - in the case of a particular adrenal disease which I can't quite remember the name of.... which might account for wrinkly hands and flakey dry skin.\nBreastfeeding babies giving them the correct sized fat and cholesterol molecules might develop the correct responses in the adrenals...\nAnyway it's just a theory of mine.. Is there any research that anyone knows of in this direction? Anything involving allergies, fat metabolism, hormones, fish oils...... anything???\nDate: Wed, 3 Apr 1996 11:40:37 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: face to face\nRalph, you are certainly a diplomat. I'm having some kind of allergic, bright red blotchy facial problem. For some reason it doesn't feel too badly, but I know it looks like h---. A few people say nothing, but when someone does ask me, which happened just this morning, I say I'm having an allergic reaction to something--I'm a longterm cortisone user because of eczema. Then I get a sympathetic response. A few years ago I would have died a thousand deaths or just stayed home. Now I can at least discuss it like it's not a big deal. I splash alcohol on it to kill slight itchiness, and to keep my hands off it.\nShelley mentioned attending an eczema group, worrying about how awful everybody would look--only no one did. Don't you think that's a huge testament to how exceedingly well we AD people hide or cover up our problem? And then we wonder why there's not much interest in our problem--heck, we appear to be functioning just like everybody else. Why should we require any special dispensations?\nSkin Deep is validating thousands of things I've known for years about this disease. It is such a relief to see it in print--no longer do I have to minimize my problem.\nDate: Wed, 3 Apr 1996 15:00:47 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: hypnosis\nKris: I tried hypnosis years ago. I didn't feel any affects from it. In fact, the whole time the guy claimed I was hypnotized, I simply felt like I was laying in bed thinking about things with my eyes closed, like I do at night before I drift off to sleep. I think that's called a hypnogogic state, where you're conscious but very relaxed. Anyway, I went for a number of sessions and then stopped because I already knew how to relax. I mean, I had expectations created by the movies. I thought that while hypnotized my subconsciousness would be given some kind of instruction to stop feeling itchy and then I would mysteriously not be itchy or not scratch even if I was itchy. The hypnotist that I saw said that was not how it worked. But you might as well try it if you need to learn techniques for guiding yourself gradually into calmer states of mind when you're agitated. Or perhaps you'd have an entirely different experience.\nDate: Wed, 3 Apr 1996 16:56:56 -0500 From: Francisco Subject: hypnosis\nSome patients are highly hypnotizable, and from your description you are not. Recently there was a pilot study on patients with psoriasis. There were good responses in those that were highly hypnotizable, whereas the moderate to low hypnotizable individuals did not improve. Interestingly most patients felt overall better, and I assume it is the result of learning relaxation techniques.\nI agree with you that laying there hearing strange suggestions of improvement does not magically result in clearing of skin lesions. Recently there was an article published in the British Journal of Dermatology examining the effect of hypnosis in eczema patients, and they report excellent results. Unfortunately it was not randomized, blinded and controlled, but this is very difficult to do in these kind of studies. Since this disease intermittently gets better and worse, it is also difficult to validate studies.\nDate: Thu, 4 Apr 1996 10:01:09 GMT+0930 From: Alicia Subject: hypnosis\nI've had about 4 hypnotherapy sessions and I can't say I really got a lot out of them. I've heard the theory that an allergy develops in infant if that child is not attended to and comforted in time, creating a cycle of rage - as in the old 60's style of santisized birth where children were carted off to nurseries straight after birth and given only 4 hourly feeds - usually on bottle not breast milk, instead of the current and more sane trend of demand breast feeding. I certainly know that I was one of those 60's babies, but I personally put my allergy down to the fact that I was a 2 week premature baby who was feed cow's milk - not really the fact that my mind is in a state of anger about being periodically deprived of my mother. Mum always said that I was an \"angry\" baby but any baby with infantile eczema usually is. Mum also said that she was extremely angry throughout her pregnancy with me (marriage problems..) but I really doubt whether that has much to do with it either as my brother who was born after me, not premature and feed exclusively on breast milk for 6 months at least, would've gone through the same kind of pregnancy and although he has the same kind of skin as me, it's not as dry, doesn't have as wrinkly palms and he has absolutely no allergies.\nCall me a reductionist, call me a cynic, but to me hypnotherapy is a good tool to control your stress concerning eczema but the cause of ezcema and allergies is more biochemical and physiological - it's not a state of mind. Reprogramming initial responses to the outside world and your bodies chemical responses to it is a pretty tall order anyway - especially if even the therapist has no idea of the stress triggers. I've also never been able to link my eczema to stress. My ezcema causes stress, but I've been through some pretty stressful times and not broken out in eczema.\nThe mind is an amazingly powerful thing, but as anyone who's taken a trip will tell you, it's a chemical organ just like the rest of us.\nIt is interesting to note however that the pituarity which controls cortisone production in the adrenals - sits just below the hypothalamus in the brain. The hypothalamus is the mediator between the emotional and analytical brain. The pituary also controls some sex hormones and it is often said that is why women who are emotionally upset often skip their periods. So you know....maybe for some people hypnotherapy can work... but it didn't seem to be the answer for me.\nDate: Thu, 4 Apr 1996 13:30:27 +0930 From: Samantha Subject: Different climates\nJustin and Alicia mooted the ideas of climates being better/worse for eczema. I think that of all the places I have lived in tropical places are best but it seems that both Justin and Alicia have had bad experiences with the tropics.\nI have lived in almost every climate possible (except extreme desert and arctic conditions) and had severe eczema in all.\nI have never found that one place is better than any other in terms of skin - it has been bad everywhere but here I find that I like the wet tropical climate even though I react to moulds quite severely.\nDate: Thu, 4 Apr 1996 13:30:34 +0930 From: Samantha Subject: EPO\nIn regards to evening primrose oil, it is said that benefits won't be seen until it has been used for three months or so. I have used it for longer periods and haven't noticed any dramatic improvement. The only side effect I noticed is the hole it makes in my pocket - it is sooooo bloody expensive!\nDate: Wed, 3 Apr 1996 21:38:47 -0800 From: Ann Subject: Alicia's allergy shots\nAlicia, Welcome to our group. I am going through desensitization treatments (allergy shots) for dustmites, trees, grasses, and weeds. Because I am a \"skin reactor\" with so many severe allergies, I was started two full dilutions down from what other people start with. It's been almost 2 years and I never missed a week (I started by going twice a week but moved to once a week to reduce the flares). I have just made it to the top level for all but grasses; I hope to get there for grasses late in the summer when pollen level are lowest.\nMost people get to the top in a few months, but my doctor (bless her!) has found that it's best to move very slowly with people like me. Anyhow, my skin is so much better and continues to get better, although I know the shots are probably not going to be a complete cure. I know how bad the flares from shots can be; I remember hearing (or imagining that I heard) my face skin popping (like those plactic packing bubbles) as I gently pressed it to release the ooze!\nAnyhow, after a flare like that, (which always spread to full body in a few hours) we would drop the strength of the shots back and then gradually move back up. The nurses said I'd never make it to red (the strongest stuff) for any of the antigens. I ( and my patient, smart doctor) are proving them wrong (very friendly competition - these nurses are the ones sticking the needles in me!) Anyhow, if you do try the shots again, be sure they start you very low and move very slowly.\nOn the hormone issue, when I was pregnant, my skin was not great. I had predisone shots during the pregnancy which made it better. The predisone was (I think) to make the babies lungs develop as I kept going into labor early (I was fLat on my back for the last 3 months); the skin clearing was a side effect. When I was nursing my skin went downhill- arms and legs particularly. My skin is now a lot better than it was 2 to 3 years ago and I'm 49 so I must have less hormones now than I did then. When my face was red all the time they tested my estrogen level to see if it was a hot flash type thing; the test said my estrogen (and other female hormones) were not at all low. ????????????\nDate: Thu, 4 Apr 1996 11:01:17 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: scalps\nI just thought of another factor in dealing with scalp eczema. If you can't shave your head (don't laugh, I did it once when my scalp eczema was really bad) you have to be really careful with combs and brushes that you use. If the tips are sharp, they are digging into your head every time you use it. I even realized that I had a problem with a brush I was using, even though it had little balls on the ends of the tips, because the little balls were also irritating my scalp. Now I make sure to only use a brush that has big enough balls (I don't know how else to say that) on the tips so that they don't dig into the soft/raw skin on my head.\nDate: Thu, 4 Apr 1996 12:57:33 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: hypnosis\nAlicia, Thanks for sharing your experiences and ideas. It is incomprehensible to a lot of people that an infant can develop rage. I would have agreed years ago, except that of four children in my family, only one of us doesn't have an ax to grind--my mother's favorite son. I see the same symptoms of anger in myself and my other two siblings--not a pretty sight. And they know less than I do about the source of their anger.\nI was a term baby, born with a \"veil\" over my face, nursed the old fashioned way in 1941--no new scientific methods there! Rage that originates from the cradle is not easily dissipated, even when one understands why. We three siblings (the rejected ones) have all had eczema tendencies and symptoms--mine being the worst--the \"loved\" son has never had any.\nI have to disagree with you about eczema being a state of mind. I never related body and mind before either, certainly not in my youth--not until I reached middle age and discovered my skin reacting to my emotions. Part of the problem was that I learned so thoroughly to dissociate my feelings from circumstances in my life, I never connected the two. Until I was forced to pay attention to my feelings when I realized a longtime \"friend\" was treating me like dirt. Thus began my stress-related eczema--after a number of years when I had been entirely free of it. Yes, I agree that eczema itself causes stress and a ton of anxiety and apprehension.\nDate: Thu, 4 Apr 1996 15:49:11 -0500 From: Francisco Subject: hypnosis\nI have no idea what makes somebody a good hypnotic subject. There are textbooks addressing this matter, but I think that it remains unresolved. There is a standrd test that we administer to determine the degree of hypnotizability, but basically it consists of going through the motions of hypnosis itself. The more \"liberal\" and Ericksonian hypnosis practitioners will strongly disagree with the conclusions of my study, but as I mentioned earlier, only the highly hypnotizable subjects improved, and they represent only about 15-20% of the population. I also can't tell you why it worked. I did not attempt to resolve any past or hidden conflicts. I believe that with the use of hypnosis I am able to deliver a very powerful \"placebo\" effect. It is also interesting that about 20% of the population responds to placebos. Maybe they are the same people.\nDate: Thu, 4 Apr 1996 17:16:25 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: EPO\nI'm cracking up!! No one else has mentioned much about the cost of keeping our disease in the comfort zone. I remember in my 20s skipping the prescription fill because I just couldn't afford it. Then when my doctor asked me if it worked, I was too ashamed to tell him I didn't buy it.\nDate: Thu, 4 Apr 1996 17:27:57 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Alicia's allergy shots\nI'm absolutely amazed that shots seem to help you, Ann. I gave myself my own shots when I was in my 20s, but I really don't remember any beneficial effect. And I was told long ago that once past puberty, shots aren't particularly effective. In other words, one's cells are set in stone. I can remember times when I felt like I was in statuary because of taut skin. You must have a wonderful physician--female, no less!! Why do we females feel better with female doctors? They are much better listeners and more empathic, even with a full schedule, generally speaking. Although my first real dermatologist was Jewish, white haired and balding, who told me I could write to him whenever I wanted. He was the first derm dr to connect me up with a psychiatrist, and would write me a letter afterward telling me why I had to see a shrink. He was the exception to the rule! Your doctor sounds like that. In my 30s I lost him to the grim reaper, and that's when my troubles really began. My records were lost to me. What a fool I was not to ask for them.\nDate: Thu, 4 Apr 1996 17:30:49 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: scalps\nI admire your audacity, Shelley--shaving your head. I was always too concerned about covering it up, let alone bare it for the world to see.\nDate: Thu, 4 Apr 1996 22:32:39 -0800 From: Ann Subject: Doctors and Scalp eczema\nShelley, I'm a comb person. I think what hair I have would be gone if I tried to brush it! Anyhow, I find that any new comb is too sharp for my scalp. So I let other family members break in the new ones before I use them. I guess the plastic or rubber wears smooth with use.\nKristen, Yes, my allergist is excellent. But her gender is not the one I would choose if I could (she's the only allergist in town)! I'm probably the only female in the world who prefers male doctors, but I do. I think it's because of the old locker room comparison trauma. I'm extremely thin and women in general are insanely jealous of that (even though I'm obviously not healthy- shows how screwed are society is). Anyhow, undressing in front of any woman (even doctors) always seems to elicit comments about my weight; whereas men dont react on a personal level. About truly cold, uncaring doctors: I'm sure there are some out there, but I think one thing we eczema patients have to realize is that doctors HATE not being able to help a patient. So when someone walks in with global long-term eczema, which is essentially incurable, the doctor is not going to feel real successful or project his best personality. So, as I see it, what we patients perceive as insensitivity is actually a feeling of failure. I guess doctors could learn to be better actors, but I'd rather they spend the time learning other things and I'll get my strokes elsewhere.\nDate: Sat, 6 Apr 1996 17:01:40 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Male vs Female doctors\nAnn, You are certainly not the only woman who prefers male doctors. I've heard of many that do. It does seem that, for ob/gyn exams in particular, many women prefer a woman, but even in that situation many women want a male doctor.\nOtherwise I guess most of the male ob/gyns would be out of business, and I don't see that happening.\nI find that I am fairly comfortable with a physician of either sex. When my prostate has to be examined (finger in the rectum), I do find it slightly embarrassing to have a woman do it. But in fact I'm not extraordinarly fond of having *anyone* do that particular exam.\nOne female doctor did cause me to say \"ouch\" during that procedure with, I think, a fingernail that was too long. And oddly, long fingernails were mentioned by a male doctor whose Compuserve post I once read on the subject of women preferring male ob/gyns. At the time I thought it was a trivial point, but since I got poked, I'm not so sure. I should mention that responsible women practitioners seem to keep their nails very short.\nI think it is very poor practice for a doctor of any gender or sexual orientation to make non-medical references to a patient's body appearance. I suspect that most male doctors, these days especially, wouldn't dare say anything like that for fear of being accused of sexual harrassment or something similar.... even if they too felt jealousy or desire upon glancing at a patient's body.\nBut simple considerations of patient privacy and dignity should rule out such comments from *any* health care professional. After all, you're only undressing because it's necessary for the medical exam, not to show off your bod.\nAlso, who's to say whether a given female doctor prefers male or female sexual partners? Believe me, any person is capable of sexually harrassing any other person, regardless of gender.\nI think it's fair to ask, what is the ethical way for a physician to handle that \"feeling of failure\"? The patient is always in the rather helpless position of having to ask the doctor for advice and assistance. If the physician is feeling helpless, why not say so, or at least express some kind of (perhaps detached) awareness of the level of suffering?\nUnfortunately, I think the problem may be that the physician doesn't want to get into the position of offering comfort, thereby exposing him/herself to more feelings of sadness, and possibly encouraging the patient to return for additional sympathy in the future. Many doctors can't tolerate that.\nI came to the conclusion that few people are really cut out for the job. A rare combination of emotional strength, technical ability, and compassion make for a truly excellent doctor. There are probably a few in each medical school class.\nDate: Mon, 8 Apr 1996 10:37:26 GMT+0930 From: Alicia Subject: New subscriber\nDiane, Why jacuzzi? If it's causing you such problems why don't you avoid it, at least until your skin clears up. You can also change the chlorination system to be a salt one. Salt water, I've heard is very good for some people's ezcema.\nIt's sounds like your skin problem is a specific contact one. About the only thing you can do about it is avoid the allergen - chlorine. Where I live they put bucket loads of chlorine in the drinking water. You can sometimes smell it as you turn on the tap. A lot of asthmatics claim that it causes their asthma and thus get their own rainwater tanks for drinking water. Anyway I hope it clears up for you.\nDate: Mon, 8 Apr 1996 10:49:07 GMT+0930 From: Alicia Subject: psychiatrist\nDid the psychiatrist help? I wasn't rejected by my mother in any way. I asked last Christmas whether or not she was ashamed of me as a baby because I'd broken out in ezcema and she says that she was desperately concerned for me but never ashamed. I proposed to her that she was disappointed in having another girl (I was the third girl and she was hoping to have a boy) and she said that she would've always loved any baby of hers and Dad's regardless of sex, and although she (not Dad) was hoping for a boy, she was happy when I was born -until I broke out in eczema at 4 months -and then it was a bit of a nightmare - having 2 other little kids - and a screaming baby who wouldn't be put down in the cot.\nI think that I developed a mentality that was intense and competitive and sometime very angry, but that was a result of, not the cause of my ezcema. Apparently I was a sweet little much loved thing before the onset of infantile eczema.\nDate: Mon, 8 Apr 1996 11:14:45 GMT+0930 From: Alicia Subject: Alicia's allergy shots\nThat's very encouraging. How much better are you off now? eg Where did you have eczema before you started on the programme?, where you do have eczema now? I've gotten through a treatment for dustmite although I don't know whether I am really desensitised at a skin level or not. I can take a 5000 concentration dose - they started my on 20 - and not get a flare up reaction, but I still seem to get itchy when I'm sleeping in a place where I know there are lots of dustmite.\nI'm still having the dustmite boosters, but I'm still getting over the last flare up for the grasses injection (that was 3 weeks ago!) I might try it again only this time a lot more slowly. Thanks for the encouragement.\nThe hormone issue is interesting. How does predisone make babies lungs develop? The doctor I went to last time said that pregnancy will either make eczema better or worse - it just depends on which type you are - which seemed very strange to me. I've never heard of cortisone being used to aid development though. Do you know any more about this? Maybe it's a link to asthma.\nRight. When you are nursing your oestrogens and progesterones are meant to drop right off (causing post-natal depression among other things) but there doesn't seem to be any link between your hormone levels and your state of skin does there? So who knows hey? It's just that it can be quite a definte thing with me that just after my period, my skin is definitely a lot better. I thought that maybe it was just that I was coping with it better, but no it is better.\nDate: Mon, 8 Apr 1996 12:45:38 GMT+0930 From: Alicia Subject: Alicia's allergy shots\nI know a number of people with bad allergies - mostly hayfever - who have virtually been cured by desensitisation treatments. They were well out of puberty. The doctors that I went to to get the densens' treatments also claimed to have fixed up a few people with bad eczema due to dustmite. I will ask my doctor next time whether he can ask these people to get in contact with me so that I can see for myself how well the treatment worked. My problem was that the dustmite wasn't my only allergen. My doctor was quite surprised that it took so long for me to clear up, because he'd had a few success stories before me.\nDate: Mon, 8 Apr 1996 10:16:24 -0800 From: Ann Subject: allergy shots\nAlicia, When I started the shots, I was covered with eczema (except for most of my feet); I guess it was mostly moderate. I am still covered but it is much better - lots of mild areas. I think I'm using less steroids and I know that the facial flares are not as wild looking. (At my worst, I often had dark red cheeks and a yellow nose.) I had to wear wet clothing to sleep and now I only sometimes wet wrap the face,neck and scalp. I am allergic to most foods, molds ,animals etc., so I know the shots won't cure me completely. But I was almost suicidal when I started the shots (mainly because so many hours of my day and night were comsumed with eczema I didn't see the point in continuing). Now, I am enough better that I can cope with it. I still do flare almost every night (except when loaded with steroids) but it's much less of an event. Also, my respiratory ailments are better. I can't remember exactly why they gave me the prednisone during the pregnancy, but it was a nightmare 9 months: many drugs etc..\nDate: Mon, 8 Apr 1996 11:10:03 PST From: Wren Subject: How I am today/face to face\nAm catching up on your messages after a wonderful relaxing week. Samantha - my scratching is worse at night too. I rotate between Tylenol, Advil, and hydoxine HCl (I can't remember the common name for this) to calm the itching. It does help me sleep and not itch.\nDate: Mon, 8 Apr 1996 12:03:39 PST From: Wren Subject: scalp treatment\nKristen, I tried hypnosis last year, but it didn't work for me. I don't know if I'm just not that suggestable or if the excema itch symptom overpowers my mental strength. Or perhaps my hypnotist wasn't so great. It really doesn't matter, it didn't work for me.\nBut I encourage you to try it, because I firmly believe that we have to find what works for each one of us, and our cures will be different according to body chemistry and emotional chemistry.\nDate: Mon, 8 Apr 1996 13:03:53 PST From: Wren Subject: Greetings and Dyshidrosis\nJustin, Give EPO (evening primrose oil) and many other \"natural\" therapies AT LEAST 6 weeks or longer to evaluate. They really have to have time to change your body chemistry, which in turn may help your eczema.\nDate: Mon, 8 Apr 1996 14:07:59 From: Richard Subject: FAST REPORT\nHi, everybody. Well I fasted for 7 days and have eaten very little since as I come back to eating normal foods. Last 3 days was cooked veggies. Tomorrow I start on raw veggies and fruit. My skin got worse as the fast progressed. I think I would have had to fast for another week to get to the bottom of it. Once I started eating, my skin got better. The problem with AD is the prescription stew we all ingest to keep going. I've gone 1 1/2 weeks without any medication (except topical steroids). That in itself is a blessing.\nMy skin does much better when my diet is extremely limited to veggies (green). If I can maintain it, it is the way to go.\nRe: Cortizone: Samantha, I was on prednisone for years. As soon as I started to flare, I would just take more. Though I felt good (except for the mood swings), I was moon-faced, bloated and developed cataracts at age 45. The minuses definitely outweighed the plusses.\nDate: Mon, 8 Apr 1996 16:51:49 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: FAST REPORT\nRichard--Fascinating report on fasting and cortisone. Appreciated hearing about your firsthand experiences, esp. eating veggies, smoking, and effects of cortisone. I think I been on the moon(face) planet on and off. Wonder if you had some kind of withdrawal reaction while fasting. Never interested in smoking--the thought of smoke in my nostrils was a turnoff long ago.\nDo you have any sense of whether milk products help or hinder your skin? Reading your report makes me think we are all destined to go to hell in a handbasket! haha Even the simple pleasures are denied to AD persons. How does chocolate affect your skin?\nDate: Mon, 8 Apr 1996 17:12:24 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: scalp treatment\nThanks for the encouragement, Wren. It is interesting that no one on the List has had any particularly positive results. I don't expect it to do anything for itching--believe it or not, itching is not a huge problem for me anymore. I want to try hyposis more for head work and integration of feelings/thoughts. Provided I can find someone who is worth the trouble. Not sure how to go about it yet. Emotional chemistry is a big factor even in working with a shrink, or any other doctor. It's all trial and error--just like AD. We've all probably been spinning our wheels over the same simple problems because we had no rudder for our quest.\nDate: Mon, 8 Apr 1996 20:30:34 -0800 From: Ann Subject: doctors\nKristen, When I said I hated to undress in front of a doctor, I didn't mean I did a striptease act! They comment on the thin thing even through the paper frock. Maybe they are just concerned that I have anorexia ( I'm not THAT thin) and want to rule that out as a factor in my health problems? There I go being charitable to doctors again! Anyhow, I've always wished for a derm dr. with skin problems; You are lucky to have one.\nDate: Tue, 9 Apr 1996 11:03:10 -0400 From: Robert Subject: FAST REPORT\nRichard, since you got worse while on the fast and only better later, it may be that both the getting worse and better were totally or paritally unrelated to the fast. What do you think? I find that what works at one time doesn't at another and visa versa. Also, contributing factors (stress, food, etc.) which impact me at one time don't at others.\nDate: Tue, 9 Apr 1996 11:38:07 From: Richard Subject: FAST REPORT CONTINUED\nKris -- I dont do dairy (except for the occasional pizza). I dont have 1st hand experience with it causing skin flares. However, since I have respiratory stuff from time to time, I breathe better without it. Chocolate is no good for me. It makes me itch within 10 mins of digesting.\nI have started eating raw veggies and fruit as well as cooked veggies (no grains or what's called nightshades). I've got to say that my skin stopped flaring and except for itching on my wrists and elbow crooks, I feel pretty darn good. I also added epsom salts to my aveeno baths at night. Seems to help. This is a minimalist diet but the effect is to reduce itching. Foods will start be added one at a time to see the reaction. More to come....\nDate: Tue, 9 Apr 1996 16:07:03 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: FAST REPORT CONTINUED\nI'm amazed at the instant reaction you get to foods. Nothing like that happens to me with any particular food. I get more rapid responses being around cats, dogs, outdoor winds with pollens, etc. I don't envy you the limited diet--it bored me stiff when I was on a no milk-no wheat,grain,bran,gluten diet. I was also irritated as all get-out because pastas, pizza, all \"real\" breads, and just about everything else is made with those ingredients. I finally just scrapped it--when I returned to milk after a year, I found out I had become lactose intolerant. So breakfast became a forgotten entity. I like fruits and vegetables--but not a straight diet of nothing else but. How do you stand it?\nDate: Tue, 9 Apr 1996 17:18:13 PST From: Wren Subject: FAST REPORT CONTINUED\nRichard, I was surprised and interested in the fact that your itching got worse as the fast progressed. Any ideas why? Do you think that your body was releasing toxins that caused you to itch?\nDate: Wed, 10 Apr 1996 08:51:14 From: Richard Subject: 1 WK AFTER FAST\nHi, everyone. I was doing really well until right before bedtime last night when I let myself scratch myself deeply in my elbow joints. I'm always so pissed and upset afterward, not to mention in pain. My skin is really dry and flaky so anywhere I scratch even lightly feels good. Anyway, I think it may be the popcorn that I ate that day. Today is raw veggies only. We'll see how that goes.\nKris--I've been a vegan for almost 2 years so it's not tooooo bad. I miss deep fried foods. But, I wouldn't go back.\nWren & Robert--I think the fast caused the toxins to release though you never know for sure. I wish I would have had 2 to 3 weeks to fast and see what happened. So far the best thing for my rash is taking 3 baths a day and not working.\nDate: Wed, 10 Apr 1996 10:17:37 PST From: Wren Subject: 1 WK AFTER FAST\nRichard, I just started drinking a Chinese herb tea made by an experience Chinese Derm MD. The results have been phenomenal. My sloughing has stopped. Itching has lessened, the skin all over my body has improved. It's smooth everywhere except my hands, feet, and elbow and knee outsides. I still itch and have some sores, but the improvement has been practically miraculous. The MD is sure that I'll get much better yet.\nDate: Wed, 10 Apr 1996 13:21:05 PST From: Wren Subject: Diane\nDiane, I too would beg you to find another way to exercise. Repeated exposure to the chlorine will only worsen your condition. With time it can keep you in constant pain with sores. Your body is giving you a strong message: it doesn't like chlorine. Stop now while you can control it. Also, you may want to install a chlorine filtering showerhead if you shower.\nDate: Thu, 11 Apr 1996 14:06:47 +0930 From: Samantha Subject: chocolate\nConcerning the query about chocolate that Kristin posted - well with Easter just passed and the tons of chocolate bunnies, bilbies* and eggs consumed - I am certainly feeling it but *any* very concentrated food aggravates my skin.\nDate: Wed, 10 Apr 1996 21:06:13 -0800 From: Ann Subject: Misc. helpful(?) hints\nDiane, I agree with Wren. You have a strong suspicion as to what's causing your rash; so get away from the irritant. Most of us have been itching and scratching for so long because of so many irritants that it's an impossibly complex puzzle with no workable solution. When eczema first appears may be the last chance to get it under control! You mentioned a jacuzzi. Could it simply be the hot water in the jacuzzi? It might make sense to try the pool without the jacuzzi and see if you clear up. (Also it seems to me that jacuzzis have more chlorine in them than regular pools.) I know that when my skin was relatively good, I could swim in pools, but never could I stand the heat (or extra chemicals?) of the jacuzzi.\nEveryone, You've probably all figured this out already, but a way to minimize scratching damage is to repeatedly dig your nails in but don't actually scratch. It's not the greatest thing for the skin, but the damage is less than full scratching. I use it mainly on my back.\nAlso, having a thick coat of nail polish (on short nails of course) on and under the nail tips cuts down on scratch damage. Don't try this if you are allergic to the chemicals in nail polish! If you don't want to look polished ( still listening, guys?), use clear polish and smudge it with kleenex when it's almost dry.\nDate: Thu, 11 Apr 1996 08:52:03 -0400 From: Robert Subject: Misc. helpful(?) hints\nI agree strongly about the advise concerning chlorine. What happens with my eczema, once it is set off and \"settled\", the causes multiply and the body gets out of balance. Therefore, I would strongly advise that you avoid the chlorine, spa (go to a different one or find a substitute that doesn't involve chlorine, install a jaccuzzi in your house which in the long run would be cheaper, etc.)\nDate: Fri, 12 Apr 1996 14:35:08 -0400 From: Shelley Subject: Rage and Brains\nI agree with Alicia that my rage is a result of the eczema, not the cause of it. I believe that it's impossible to blame any one factor for this condition, it's clearly multifactorial. Part of my problem is perhaps in the brain's connection to my nervous system. I seem to have a need for stronger and more frequent tactile sensory input than do \"normal\" people. I mean, I need to constantly give my brain tactile feedback. When I've gone a long time without being able to touch my skin, (for instance when I'm dressed up all day), I get itchy. That of course triggers a scratching frenzy and causes the damage of scratching and subsequent skin reactions. But if I can take my clothes off, and use a washcloth to moisten my skin, or just squeeze my skin all over, that seems to give my nervous system the stimulation that it wants. It's as if the brain creates the itch to get the scratching to get tactile stimulation. And many other factors seem to be related to my hypersensitive nervous system. For instance, I'm very sensitive to heat and can get itchy just from sitting in a chair close to the window where the sun is shining in. My body reacts to very subtle changes in the environment, changes that I may not even be consciously aware of until I've gone into a scratching frenzy and later wonder what happened. I don't discount entirely the theory of infantile rage but for me, at least, it could only be a contributing factor among many. Perhaps the rage is created by the nervous system to get stimulation. You could select any theory as a center and shape the factors around it.\nDate: Fri, 12 Apr 1996 18:03:31 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: refferal from eczema pdx\nWayne for Trish---I've seen catalogs for completely cotton clothing--actually quite expensive--but I know there's a manufacturer of all cotton stuff out there. I wonder if there isn't something on the Net. Or even talking to a buyer for women's clothing who would probably know where to direct her search. I can't stand rubberized stuff next to my skin either, so I no longer wear any garments like that unless the rubber is encased in the fabric.\nDate: Fri, 12 Apr 1996 21:41:40 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Rage and Brains\nInteresting, but I also happen to believe that there is something wrong with our SKIN. I certainly don't subscribe to the theory that this is \"all in our minds.\" I haven't made my way through the entire \"Skin Deep\" book, but I get the impression that the authors believe that it's mostly mental? I just can't buy that.\nMy son had eczema starting from the time he was about three months old. Was he remembering some infantile trauma? Nah, the eczema WAS the trauma.\nIn other words, I agree with you, Shelley. Our skin isn't supposed to be this \"sensitive\" or itchy. Something ain't right.\nDate: Sat, 13 Apr 1996 13:38:03 EDT From: David Subject: Cotton clothing\nI have found elastic-free cotton socks which stay up without making red marks on my legs. This is particularly important to me because the worst area of eczema I have is on my lower leg.\nThey (the socks that is, not my legs) are manufactured in the UK.\nDate: Sat, 13 Apr 1996 21:06:33 -0800 From: Ann Subject: something sure ain't right!\nRalph, The way I look at it, I basically have normal skin. BUT my immune system is out of whack; I am allergic to many, many things. My skin happens to be my primary \"target organ\"; most of my allergic reactions occur in the skin (via the bloodstream - I don't seem to have many contact allergies). The resulting rashes and the endless scratching have altered, and maybe even re-wired, the nerves in the skin. I believe that if my immune system could be completely fixed, my skin would be normal except maybe for the hypersensitive nerves which might have been permanently altered. My allergist agrees with me on this. My derm dr., however, believes that my skin is just plain devoid of oil, and therefore is very susceptable to irritation. He thinks that even without any allergies, I would still have friable skin. None of us seems to think that the nervous system plays much of a role in CAUSING the eczema.\nDate: Sun, 14 Apr 1996 01:13:28 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: something sure ain't right!\nThanks for explaining your point of view. I see what you mean about our possibly having normal skin. I have had allergies all my life, too, and yes, the problem seems to me to be coming from \"inside\" the body somehow. So maybe you're right about ths skin being normal. I must admit I had never thought of it in quite that way.\nDate: Sun, 14 Apr 1996 17:39:25 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: Diane\nThe only really satisfactory treatment I've had was from a Chinese herbalist. You are given something which looks much like dried compost, boil it for about an hour and drink the results. The taste is quite appalling. I actually saw this treatment reported on in an English documentary. A dermatologist at one of the major London teaching hospitals was liaising with a Chinese herbalist in attempt to find a treatment which would be effective for all eczema sufferers (when you consult the herbalist he/she prescribes for you specifically). His colleagues were sceptical, but the results were impressive.\nIf I'm desperate, I go back to the herbalist (yes, the problem does recur, but only after a long interval), but there have been some negative reports about this treatment concerning liver damage and lack of controls over preparation which would apply to Western medicine.\nPersonally, the results I had were worth the risk, but I must admit that now my eczema is more minor, I'm looking for other alternatives.\nDate: Thu, 11 Apr 1996 08:56:02 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Rage and Brains\nI don't think Grossbart is denigrating or reducing eczema to a mere \"all in your mind\" theory. I do believe that the emotional component of the skin ailment is related much more heavily to our psychic status than meets the eye. I went thru this same thing: When I wanted concrete help for a derm problem, and got sent to a shrink, I was furious. I didn't recognize until much later that my deep-seated anger did have a detrimental effect.\nBut, itching and scratching my way from birth to adolescence to adulthood myself obviously points to more than just mental status. We have all inherited our condition or tendency to eczema from our parents or their parents genetically. The particular problems we may have in our personal lives puts more stress on our skin's fragile balance. Discounting the emotional component and reducing eczema to a total physical base is selling the disease short of all its implications. But each to his own--hindsight is definitely a plus in evaluating the overall picture!\nDate: Thu, 11 Apr 1996 09:13:52 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: something sure ain't right!\nHi Ann, I like your description, which I can relate to 100 percent. I don't think emotions CAUSE eczema either, but I do believe, at age 54, that my mental state has exacerbated the skin problem, depending on the stresses at different times in my life. I do remember feeling like I was being driven to self-destruct by certain people in my life when I was still at home. I know I don't imagine that, especially in retrospect, since living alone removed those kinds of stresses from my life.\nDate: Mon, 15 Apr 1996 18:21:55 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: Chinese herbal treatment\nKristen, as I mentioned before, the ingredients change according to the patient. This doesn't seem to be a do-it-yourself type of treatment. My herbalist brings the \"herbs\" in from China and they seem to comprise a lot more than what we understand as herbs. In my treatment I get a mixture of powders, pieces of what appears to be wood, leaves, seeds. etc.etc. The mixture is not always the same every time. We are fortunate in Auckland and have a large Chinese community who bring their doctors with them, but I imagine they would be found in most areas. I can only recommend you seek one out - when I first went I had eczema over large areas of my body. I now only have a little on my hands.\nAn interesting sideline - my herbalist questions me about how hot I am. I so happens that I didn't even get eczema until the onset of the menopause, when I was plagued by hot flushes, and I still feel that my thermostat is somewhat out of control. Perhaps there's some sort of clue here. To scratchless days!\nDate: Mon, 15 Apr 1996 16:24:21 GMT+0930 From: Alicia Subject: Chinese herbal treatment\nBrenda, You're probably pretty right. There's been a lot of talk about how doona's as opposed to sheets and blankets are making people too hot at night and causing eczema and skin problems. I know I feel cold easily at night and try and cover up (understanding of course that I already live in the tropics) and a few people who have shared a bed with me have commented about how I feel like a hot thermos... and they weren't just talking about my amazing noctural performances.\nI'm glad you've had good results. It's encouraging to hear stories like yours.\nDate: Mon, 15 Apr 1996 19:59:25 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: General itchiness\nFor a new subscriber to the list and a newbie to boot, I may be being a bit vocal but there is one other small thing which I have found very helpful. As recommended by my doctor, at the end of a shower I rub the very basic stuff *emulsifying ointment* (is this the right thing to use for quotation marks?) on to my skin (in fact when my eczema was very bad I actually used to wash with it). This keeps your skin moist and less prone to the dryness which seems to start the eczema off. Even now I'm so much better, I never use soap but some kind of non-soap or synthetic soap alternative. I know this sort of stuff is getting at the effects and not the causes, and brings up the question yet again of whether the whole thing has a psychological base, but my experience is that if you feel you've got the thing under control the problems are considerably lessened.\nDate: Mon, 15 Apr 1996 11:36:42 PST From: Wren Subject: refferal from eczema pdx\nIn this same vein, I've found organic cotton underwear at natural clothing and living, if you will, stores.\nDate: Mon, 15 Apr 1996 11:39:41 PST From: Wren Subject: Rage and Brains\nMy theory is that the eczema is caused by a systemic imbalance of some sort that is expressed through the itching and sensitivity of the skin nerves, among other factors.\nDate: Mon, 15 Apr 1996 12:26:01 PST From: Wren Subject: Diane\nI'm having great success by drinking the Chinese Tea that my MD is making for me. However, I don't think the recipe is generally available. And I don't think it should be either. Each of us has different symptoms, bodies, and needs. The doctor evaluates all of these, then makes up a the batch of roots, seeds, and other ingredients according to one's health on that day.\nAs I improve my doctor has been changing my recipe.\nHerbology is a science as well as an art; my doctor has a degree in it. The ingredients are clearly powerful chemicals that need to be handled as carefully as other medicines. I recommend that you find an EXPERIENCED acupuncturist/herbologist, or if you are lucky, an acupuncturist herbologist who specializes in skin disorders.\nDate: Mon, 15 Apr 1996 12:44:01 PST From: Wren Subject: Chinese herbal treatment\nBrenda, I agree with you about the thermostat being a little out of wack. I was cold constantly for months. Now that I'm feeling better I'm feeling normal - not warm and not cold - most of the time.\nDate: Mon, 15 Apr 1996 23:30:40 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: regime\nI went to see my dermatologist this afternoon. My hands have been getting worse and it's time for another antibiotic treatment -- it's been about six months since my last one. He prescribed his current set of coordinated remedies:\n* Diprolene ointment used with occlusion\n* Soaks with Zetar solution (tar dissolved in \"polysorbates\") in warm water\n* Biaxin (antibiotic) 500 mg twice a day for 10 days\n* Nizoral (anti-fungal) 200 mg once a day for 10 days\nDate: Tue, 16 Apr 1996 19:48:22 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: General itchiness\n>>What is emulsifying ointment?<<\nIt appears to be a base normally used for prescription ointments. It contains emulsifying wax 30%. white soft paraffin 30%. liquid paraffin 40%. Presumably most drug companies would make it. I just get it from the local chemist in 500g. pots.\nDate: Tue, 16 Apr 1996 09:50:41 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: General itchiness\nOkay, now I understand. Shelley has recommended a product called Aquaphor Ointment, which is also used by pharmacists. I have tried it and found it to be very soothing; much better than plain petroleum jelly.\nDate: Tue, 16 Apr 1996 12:45:40 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Chinese herbal treatment\nBrenda, My experience with menopause began as long-term migraines and the ultimate hot flashes--the bane on my already present curse of eczema. It was another wrack on the wretched ladder of \"maturity.\" I had to choice but to go with estrogen and progesterone. Can't say it did much for the eczema tho--just added itself to the misery.\nDate: Wed, 17 Apr 1996 17:40:17 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: gluten\n>>My homeopathic allergist has me on a no gluten diet too, though I must say it didn't appear to lessen my itching. Evidently one symptom of a gluten allergy is itching. <<\nCan't say I'm very surprised. I was told the same baloney and did the no gluten thing in my early 30s. I did not enjoy giving up bread, one of the few enjoyments left to an AD person when nearly everything else is off limits. It really made no difference in my skin condition. Unless a person is truly gluten-sensitive which is a colon problem of digestion, not eczema. Food allergies and food sensitivites, not to be minimized, are not the same thing at all. But I suppose it is hard to tell the difference unless one spends most of one's life in the diagnostic laboratory under a doctor's microscope. Guess I'd rather be like Ingrid Bergman--keep smoking to the end and lung cancer be damned!\nDate: Wed, 17 Apr 1996 17:25:15 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Pat\nHi Pat, Welcome to the Itch List. You probably already know eczema is one accommodating disease. It will burrow its way into your life one way or another, and none of us seem to have a lot in common except that we all have the itch/scratch/go nuts syndrome. I pursue comfort to all other exclusions, whatever that takes. I'm 54 and have never documented any relationship between eczema and hormonal levels. In fact, I rarely have any itching, nothing morbid at least, that causes me to dig myself up. But the 'Pause could go away.\nAside from that, because I'm a longterm, regular user of cortisone facially--and getting off it-- my face is now so acutely sensitized to absolutely everything, I have inadvertently given myself acute facial edema and intense heat from lotions I had used before that were never a problem. Now I'm trying to find a simple, low viscoid oil for lubricating the skin of my face. A pharmacy here suggests grapeseed oil because it's very thin. Any commercially prepared lotions have so many chemicals in them, they are all hopeless. Vitamin E oil seems okay as well as vaseline, but it's so heavy for the summer and so sticky, I can't stand it.\nWhen itching used to keep me away at night, I would take anything I could to knock me out, even if it was just aspirin. But tranquilizers are the best. I use Doxepin with good results, from 10 mg for daytime to 50 mg for bedtime, but Shelley has had negative results with Doxepin.\nDate: Wed, 17 Apr 1996 23:03:05 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Throw caution to the winds?\nYup, I had the same experience. No difference at all when I was on a highly restrictive diet. In fact, my skin seemed to be slightly worse.\nUm, bread vs. cigarettes, hmmm. I'll take gluten over nicotine any day.\nDate: Thu, 18 Apr 1996 12:41:32 -0400 From: Shelley Subject: Staph Bacteria\nRalph, Your mention of superantigens and staphalococus bacterium was interesting to me because I know I had a staph infection after an operation when I was about 9 years old. Do the doctors think that staph bacteria somehow help create this superantigen? I don't quite understand the connection. My eczema was no worse after the staph infection, but no better either. Before you mentioned it, I assumed it had no effect at all on my eczema. Could the staph infection have created a superantigen that set me up for a lifelong chronic condition instead of a condition that disappeared at puberty (as some eczema conditions do)?\nDate: Thu, 18 Apr 1996 10:44:40 From: Richard Subject: To Glute or not to Glute...\nMy experience is that the intensity of the itching reduces with the more retrictive my diet. The problem with wheat is that it's in everything and who knows what the threshold level is. I think it's very important what goes in one's mouth as it gets pushed out to the skin. The question is, in the scheme of things, is this more important than smog, pollens, dyes in detergent or dirt? I don't think so, but in my way of thinking that doesn't mean I shouldn't try everything possible.\nWhen I realized *they* were never going to make it better, I got stronger and took control of my life. I still wince when I feel like a *case* instead of a person. But, I think docs do care if only for 15 minutes.\nI'm starting 3 weeks after the fast, still on a highly restricted diet of cooked veggies, raw veggies and fruit. My skin, though not flaring goes through cycles of better 1 day, worse the next. If I could only get it through my thick skull that it always feels worse after scratching than before when I am about to go for it....\nDate: Thu, 18 Apr 1996 11:08:51 PST From: Wren Subject: Throw caution to the winds?\nI asked my homeopathic allergist if I could start eating wheat again after my great progress using the Chinese herbs. She replied emphatically, \"No.\" I have no idea if not eating wheat and other glutinous carbs, fruit, dairy, sugar, and fermented foods has made any difference or not. But I sure miss sourdough bread slathered with butter. I may just start eating wheat and see what happens. This MD also thinks I have a yeast and dairy allergy, but who knows.\nDate: Thu, 18 Apr 1996 17:24:50 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Throw caution to the winds?\nAfter a year of no milk products, when I decided it was a useless quest, I discovered much to my chagrin I was lactose intolerant. You might want to think seriously about whether you are willing to give up some foods for a trial period, because you might end up giving them up permanently, whether you like it or not. I used to take the allergen drops under the tongue for supposed food allergies--another big waste of time and money. Some people don't consider giving up certain foods as living a deprived life, but I do. I would be bored beyond tears with Richard's veggie-veggie-and-more veggie regimen. I would go stark raving mad if that's all I could exist on. I admire his perseverance. There may be some saving grace in attaining middle age, because I rarely have the horrific itching-scratching binges anymore--I attribute it to reducing the underlying tension in my life to almost nil. My only real skin problem now is the result of cortisone overuse and finding a substitute lubricant.\nDate: Fri, 19 Apr 1996 09:01:08 GMT+0930 From: Alicia Subject: Throw caution to the winds?\nI've been told that restricting you diet too much can actually cause sensitisations. A nurse I know warned me not to stay of wheat for too long because people who have avoided wheat for 4 weeks or more have developed a gluten sensitivity or become ceoliacs (or however it's spelt). Wheat allergies are common apparently as genetic engineering to overcome moulds and insect suspectibility in wheat has resulted in the development of new wheat proteins that the human body doesn't recognise and regards as foreign.\nTo me though, if you have a known sensitivity - avoid it - but it is dangerous to start playing around and restricting your diet - increasing the liklihood of deficiencies and perhaps lowering your body's tolerances to certain foods. If you really want to avoid food intolerances then start eating seasonally and macrobiotically. The development of technologies to preserve food, canned, frozen, sulphur dried etc... really hasn't been such an amazing thing. It has just meant that we can eat whatever we want when - overdosing and underdosing on everything. Often a complete change in my diet -that I get from going overseas - holidaying in Asia for instance - clears my skin up and it stays good for a long time after I get back.\nThe sad thing about our condition I think is that it highlights the fact that humans are changing our environment faster that we can evolve to fit it. But that's another 80 page essay....\nDate: Thu, 18 Apr 1996 23:28:50 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Throw caution to the winds?\nIt is common practice among good allergists, in my understanding, to \"rechallenge\" with a substance that's been withdrawn to see if it really is playing a role in the problem situation. If I were in your (gluten-free) shoes, I would certainly try it.\nDate: Fri, 19 Apr 1996 14:15:22 GMT+0930 From: Alicia Subject: Eczema research\n>>Allergists, in my always-humble opinion, will tend to let on that they know what is happening with the immune system, but I think the truth is that they haven't a clue. Or rather, they do know, but the stuff they know is wrong. And you can't really hold that against them. The poor dears are trying, really they are (sob).<<\nYes, they are very trying. There's something seriously wrong with the investigation of allergies. I don't really think that it is a big global conspiracy to sell more drugs but it think there is far too much concentration on the symptoms of allergies rather than the sensitisation process. For instance it is a pretty widely accepted truth that breast fed babies are less likely to develop eczema than bottle fed ones. Why? Babies put on goats milk ( like I was) clear up a lot. Why? Size of fat molecules, sugars, cholesterol breakdown, mother's antibodies to infection..???. A lot of people grow out of their allergies at a certain age. Why? Pregnancy seems to affect allergies Why? Exposure to certain materials - like formaldehyde - can cause sensitisation. Why? You'd think with all the evidence researchers have got to go on there would've been a bit more progress by now. I mean this sort of stuff is 20 years old. Everyone knows that allergenic people have higher levels of IgE. Big whoop. That's symptomatic. What generates the high levels of IgE? I think you're right Ralph, for all their research grants, for all their time and efforts, they are still stumbling around in the dark. Poor dears.\nDate: Fri, 19 Apr 1996 09:23:19 ... From: Richard Subject: Response to Kris\nSo far middle age has had its problems as well. I agree that the intensity seems to be waining (I.eczema., I don't think I'm in \"stop my life for 2 weeks while I recover\" anymore. However, when I was younger and more carefree, I pumped myself with so much prednisone, who knows what would of happened without it.\nDate: Fri, 19 Apr 1996 09:30:58 -0800 From: Ann Subject: environmental factors\nAlicia, You mentioned that when you go to Asia you clear up completely because of the diet change. Could it also be the change in flora (I.eczema. pollen) and fauna (I.eczema. dust mites)? If food is the factor, have you tried eating an Asian diet all the time? That's easy for me to suggest because I'm not a food person. I think the itch - scratch sensation is so intense that hunger-taste just doesn't register in me.\nEveryone, I just realized some irony. Back when all I had were some small areas of eczema, my derm dr. prescribed more than adequate quantities of steroid ointment. I can remember having 30 or 45 gram tubes and sometimes throwing out expired stuff. Now that I'm covered with eczema, he is very stingy with how much I get. I understand that it is because you absorb more of a steroid if it is spread over a larger area. But it just seems funny that I now am \"entitled\" to so much less when I need it more! I am always cutting open the empty tubes and rubbing the insides on my skin to get the last little bit. This is why I would like to see a stick form of Elocon; I think I could stretch my ration further.\nDate: Fri, 19 Apr 1996 16:48:15 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: environmental factors\nAnn, I'm a saver type, so rarely throw out expensive tubes of anything, regardless of expiration date. I don't think it is all that unsafe to use a few months past an expiration date. Esp. if budget figures into the equation. But my HMO has been more generous with my scripts since I complained about their being chintzy.\nDoes anyone know if Aquaphor has a base of wool alcohol?\nDate: Fri, 19 Apr 1996 16:26:27 PST From: Wren Subject: environmental factors\nKristen, I always thought it was fine to use drugs well past the expiration date, thinking the manufacturers built in an extra cushion of time. Now that I work for a manufacturer, I can tell you that testing is done and products potent, if you will, within the date marked on the container. After that time, the company may not have data or results that showing potency or antimicrobial properties in the drugs. The dates are for real!\nDate: Sat, 20 Apr 1996 20:32:11 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Hunger-taste doesn't register\nI'm very interested in your comments about hunger and taste, Ann. When my son Saul was about a year old, he had fairly severe eczema over most of his body. He also was not eating well at all. The dermatologist, Dr. Koblenzer, told us that the itching could be so severe that it interfered with sensations of hunger! At the time, I could hardly believe him. Not that I disbelieved him, if you know what I mean, but the idea seemed so outlandish that my mind couldn't quite accept it.\nNow that you, as an adult, are reporting the same phenomenon, I feel that my Dr. knew whereof he spoke.\nIs this still the case (as you seem to imply)? Is it related to current itching, or is it just a habit of perception, so to speak, that persists even when you are not very itchy?\nFinally, has anyone else on the list had this experience?\nDate: Sat, 20 Apr 1996 17:14:45 -0800 From: Ann Subject: hunger vs. itch\nRalph, I can't correlate low appetite times with high itch times. I just know that I have always had a pretty weak appetite. Part of it is probably a survival mechanism; I have lots of food allergies, some anaphalaxtic. So many times for me, not eating at all has been the healthiest thing to do!\nDate: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 09:25:16 GMT+0930 From: Alicia Subject: environmental factors\nCould be flora and dust mites. But I don't know why there should be dustmite here, but not in Timor (Indonesian Island 300km north). Flora is a big one though. I think I'm definitely allergic to something that grows here. Unfortunately there are no region specific skin tests (something for someone to make a lot of money on..) so the grasses etc.. that I got tested for on the skin test probably don't even grow here.\nThe other thing is all the pesticides, termite poisons, electromagnetic pollution, man-mede crap that we toxify our industrialised world with, may not be in use in some of the primitive places that I was staying in in Timor/Bali. There are so many environmental things. I just know that I come back from Indonesia eczema free and a vision of health. If I go back to S the eczema comes back 4 months to a year later, when I flew back to D it started to come back with 2 weeks.\nDid try for a while to stay on an Asian diet. Which excluded bread and a lot of diary products - used fresh unrefridgerated veges, rice, and has tropical fruits - paw-paw, mangos, pineapple and heaps of bananas but it's very hard to stay on this lovely diet when you are living a modern lifestyle, and don't have a lot of time to prepare you're own Asian dishes. I always seem to get back to work and snack on chips etc.., eat breads and drink coffees. I have been on gluten, lacto free diets before, and it didn't really seem to clear it up like a trip to Asia did. Ohh... it's such a lovely place.. I recommend it.\nDate: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 09:41:52 GMT+0930 From: Alicia Subject: hunger vs. itch\nIt's the same for me Ann. I just have a low appetite constantly but this is a new thing for me. I got up here and just thought that the effect of the heat meant that my body didn't have to warm it's self quite so much therefore I didn't have an appetite to eat so much. But it was the same time my eczema got a lot worse as well. I miss liking food as much as I used to. Apparently a low appetite is a result of your liver not working as well as it should - not producing enough bile salts... which goes back to my cholesterol thoery... but others who I have talked to say their eczema doesn't affect their appetite at all. So I don't know...\nDate: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 18:38:37 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: hunger vs. itch\nI just wonder if hunger isn't a luxury you enjoy when nothing else is occupying your mind. Who hasn't spent hours on an absorbing task and just forgotten to eat? Maybe when the state of your skin takes priority over everything else, the appetite just disappears. I've got to admit my meals have become pretty scrappy since I bought my new computer!\nDate: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 20:25:56 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: Eyelids\nDoes anyone have a suggestion as to what you can do to cope with eczema on the eyelids? Obviously you don\"t dare use the type of treatment you use elsewhere, but simple emollients aren't enough.\nDate: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 09:27:00 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Eyelids\nI had eyelid problems for years, although they've largely gone away now (the problems, that is; my eyelids are still there). I would use opthalmic steroid ointment, which is very mild and formulated for the eyes. Of course that would have to be prescribed by your doctor. I wash my hands first, since the eyelids are very susceptible to irritation, then apply just a tiny bit of ointment before going to bed.\nSometimes when my eyelids were hurting, I would just hold a damp washcloth over my eyes; that was soothing.\nI never found any emollient that didn't irritate my eyelids. They are so sensitive, it's enough to drive a person crazy.\nDate: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 09:17:13 PST From: Wren Subject: Hunger-taste doesn't register\nI've had just the opposite experience. I was ravenous for months, and my appetite is just now waning a bit. I attributed the increased hunger to\n1) being awake and scratching for hours at night, so that I didn't rest. So maybe I needed more energy, and thus, food.\n2) I'm on a no wheat, no gluten, no sugar, no fruit, no dairy, no caffeine, no fermented foods diet, so maybe my metabolism changed. My weight did drop (I feel as if I'm gaining some back now, although my diet is the same), and I felt hungry all the time. So I ate portions that were, gosh, double, what I'd previously eaten. Whether it had to do with the systemic properties I attribute to the eczema too, I don't know.\nDate: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 09:24:23 PST From: Wren Subject: Response to Alicia\nHi all. Yep, I'm a real advocate for the Chinese herbal tea. I just started seeing a Chinese dermatologist with 30 years of experience. She checked me out, said, \"You'll be fine\", dispensed the self-prepared herbs and ointments, and true to her word, I am feeling VASTLY better. I get comments daily about how much better I'm looking. Which is great, but really secondary to me. I was more consumed with the constant itching, sloughing, and obsessing with the condition. My sloughing stopped after about 10 days, the itching is still with me, but reduced maybe 75-80%, and my skin is soft and looks normal everywhere except my hands. All I can say is that it's working for me.\nDate: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 12:33:45 -0400 From: Shelley Subject: Hunger-taste doesn't register\nRalph, I have never been interested in food. To me, eating is like putting gasoline in a car. Food is fuel and that's all. I could eat the same thing every day, and frequently do. I also eat very plainly. I often had trouble living with people because they spent so much time planning and preparing meals. I was amazed and annoyed by their need to make eating an elaborate ritual. I've had a lack of interest in taste/smell since infancy. I don't think my brain developed in those areas, because as your Dr. said, my brain was too busy processing the itch. I can barely taste/smell most food. Also, like Ann, I get anaphylactic shock from nuts and seeds so perhaps a lack of hunger is partly a self-protection mechanism. I rarely feel hungry. I eat when I think \"It's been awhile since I've eaten, I should probably eat something\". Only when I start eating and feel enthused about it do I realize, \"Oh, I was hungry\"...\nDate: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 12:32:43 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Eyelids\nBrenda, I've had eyelid problems for the last several years with miserable results. When I finally got a correct diagnosis--blepharitis--I also received a strict regimen to follow:\nWhen itchy, use Acular (nonsteroid) drops and cold compresses.\nWhen dry, gitty and teary feeling, use hot compress and lid scrubs with Ocuclenz morning and evening--religiously.\nDuring the day, when treater volume of tears are needed, use Bion tears and/or compare with Ocucoat.\nAt night before retiring to bed, use Celluvics drops (viscious).\nAfter all the years of doing the eczema routine, this is one more routine that I have trouble following. I am so sick of this daily-nightly ritual of taking care of skin problems. And so I pay with blurry vision and other eye miseries constantly. I'l like to order a new set of eyeballs.\nDate: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 12:37:19 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: New subscriber\nHi, We are all mostly longtermers with eczema, but I have lately become interested in hypnotherapy as well. It's not very well supported as legitimate therapy in this area that an insurance company will pay for. I'm checking into access. They will approve hypnotherapy for cessation of smoking. I fail to see why skin disease is considered less important than smoking.\nA few people on this list have reported less than optimal results with hypnotherapy. They were looking for relief of itching. I'm past that point, and want it more for my \"head\" than any physical problem.\nDate: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 13:12:17 PST From: Wren Subject: Throw caution to the winds?\nAlicia, Thanks for your long and thoughtful response. My homeopathic allergist put me on the restrictive diet - I sure wouldn't have dreamed it up. I did stop eating candy, and stopped drinking coffee and alcohol because they were real itch provokers. But the rest she discovered through testing. I may be a guinea pig for the acquired allergy from not eating foods theory. Will let the list know if I break down and have some sourdough bread.\nAnd I agree with you about eating the freshest, purest food possible. I am lucky to live where I can buy a great variety of fresh, organic vegetables year round. Plus all types of organic rices nonwheat pastas, and other grains. I also buy no-chemical fed chicken. It's expensive, but I'm sure it's better for my health, plus it all tastes better.\nDate: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 12:25:53 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Hunger-taste doesn't register\nGolly gee, Wren--are you sure you are still alive? On that diet, it sounds like you are ingesting nothing but air.\nI just read an article by a Dr. Thomas Brunoski, a physician in private practice in Westport CT who specializes in treatment of medical problems with nutritional and allergy therapy rather than medication.\nHe reports that studies done in the 1930s at Mayo Clinic suggested a link between sugar intake and asthma. A sugar-free diet helped control or even cure asthma in children. He advises against caffeine if one has asthma also. He administers oral immunotherapy (liquid allergy treatment administered under the tongue). Can't vouch for his success rates, but the latter certainly did nothing for me.\nBrunoski says it is almost impossible for a person to identify offending foods on his/her own.\nDate: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 19:41:12 -0500 From: Diane Subject: Redness\nEveryone writes about itching; however, my daughter's main complaint is redness. Not just pink but bright red. The redder her hands become, the skin becomes thicker accentutating all lines and creases. All lotions make her hands redder.\nDate: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 06:25:25 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Hunger-taste doesn't register\nHas your \"no wheat, no gluten, no sugar, no fruit, no dairy, no caffeine, no fermented foods\" diet led to your feeling better, either in your skin or in terms of general well-being? I tried a similar diet, but one that did allow fruit, for ten days and my skin didn't feel better at all. I'm curious as to whether it has been helpful to you over a longer period of time.\nDate: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 06:29:51 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Hunger-taste doesn't register\nThanks, Shelley. That gives me some very helpful insight into my son's food habits, which seem to be similar to yours. In his case, it seems to be a healthy pattern: he is pleasantly lean, while the rest of us in the family tend to be on the heavy side.\nDate: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 12:49:53 EDT From: Julia Subject: Children with Eczema\nWe have an eight year old daughter who has had eczema since she was a baby. She get it all over her body. We have not been able to identify any food allergies, but she is allergic to house mites.\nAlthough we have tried various alternative medicines, we find the only thing that has any real effect are steroid creams + emollients + moisturizers. For the last few months we have been wet wrapping which has had a very beneficial effect.\nDate: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 12:33:51 PST From: Wren Subject: Redness\nMy Chinese Herb MD has me soaking my hands in a special powder dissolved in warm water to soften and heal my hands. The powder comes from something that is soaked out an herb, then dried. It is acidic and in soaking my hands for 40 minutes a day, is supposed to positively change the pH of my hands. My hands and skin were redder than they used to be when my eczema was bad, but I wouldn't call it a bright red. Now that I'm using the Chinese Herbal Tea, the ointments, and this soak, my skin color is getting back to normal. Don't know if this helps, but thought you'd like the info.\nDate: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 20:49:48 PDT From: Peter Subject: New subscriber\nI was about 10 when I had chickenpox and the resulting eczema. The doctor did not seem too surprised at the time as both sides of my family have histories of asthma and eczema, and he had just treated my brother for a severe reaction to some medicines he'd been prescribed for pneumonia. (popular family myth has it that my great grandfather, who was immigrating from Sweden entered via Canada to avoid being rejected by the US immigration officials because of his eczema. Don't know how that true that is but it makes a great story!). At the time I was out of school for a month, and was given plenty of oral steroids. My mother had to put the pills into jelly beans to avoid my spitting them out because of the vile taste.\nIt eventually became manageable, and almost disappeared when I went to university. I may have grown out of it, but I also think despite the extremes, my skin prefered the drier climate to the moister climate where I had grown up.\nIt stayed relatively managaeable until about a two years ago. My sense was my skin had finally rebelling against the English climate (I miss the sun incredibly). Evening primrose oil worked for awhile, with some steriod creams prescribed by the doctor here (who by the way has eczema himself and seems to accept it as an inevitable condition of living here). It got very much worse last autumn, so on the recommendation I went to a Chinese herbalist here. After a five weeks course of tea, it has cleared up, and I have to say I notice I have much more energy than I have had for awhile (that may be the result thought, of not feeling so low about having inflamed skin and being itchy all the time).\nDate: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 14:33:32 PST From: Wren Subject: CHT\nMy Ch Dr hasn't mentioned any tests. Saw her today, and from the sounds of it I won't be taking the tea for a long period of time. Maybe a month more, perhaps less. That would make it a total of 10 weeks, maybe 3 months. Not that one can't be poisoned in a short period of time, but with 30 years of experience, she seems to know exactly what she's doing, which is making people well. Yahoo.\nAnd as I said, her tea has 16 ingredients, so is apparently a somewhat different formulation than the stuff you are using.\nDate: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 14:38:11 PST From: Wren Subject: New Drug\nI was at my homeopathic allergist yesterday (I still see her even though the CHT is doing wonders), and she let me know that there's a new allopathic (Western medicine) drug for eczema and night itching. It's called Zyrtec.\nShe asked if I wanted to try it, and I said, No\", because of the good results that I'm having with the CHT. But I thought the rest of you might be interested and could ask your doctors about it.\nDate: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 17:14:53 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Response to Alicia\nThat is fantastic news, Wren. So glad you are getting genuine relief. It even makes me feel relieved to read your words. I can so relate to the anxiety about sloughing and the distraction from itching all the time. What a boon to do something else with your mind and energy! Good luck.\nDate: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 16:01:47 PST From: Wren Subject: Hunger-taste doesn't register\nActually, I eat tons, and eat quite a variety of foods. Instead of concentrating on what I CAN'T eat, I look at everything I can. Fritos, for example, are really fun to eat. I love corn torillas fried up, then stuffed with beans, rice, veggies, or anything I can think of. Chicken and potatoes - hey you got mashed, french fries, baked, home fried. For breakfast I often eat sweet potatos (there are 3 organic varieties I can get), eggs, homemade nonwheat bread, or leftovers. They make lots of different nonwheat pastas now. How about squash, corn, broccoli, bok choy, a million kinds of beans, organic potato chips, corn nuts, all kinds of soups. Believe me, I'm a real piggy. I amaze my friends. How about Denver omelets with bacon and home fries? Yum Yum. I can eat butter, and thank goodness, have no cholesterol problems, though generally I cook with olive oil.\nThanks for the Brunkowski info. I had asthma in college, but not since I went to live in one of the moldiest places in the US. Plus, our dorms had forced air heat, which forced decades old dust out along with the warmth. I was also stressed out competing with the academic overachievers, plus had the usual social stresses. I did get allergy shots and the asthma went away.\nDate: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 16:12:40 PST From: Wren Subject: Hunger-taste doesn't register\nI didn't notice major improvement to my skin while on this diet, though I was slowly getting better. Could have been the diet in combination with the homeopathic treatments.\nHowever my general health is excellent. Just had a check up with my GP, and I was OKAY. My energy is good all the time, except when I don't get enough sleep. I don't have the mood and energy swings that I had when I drank 3 cups of coffee a day and ate sugar. I feel healthy, and rarely get sick.\nMy digestive system is apparently working better, as I have 1-3 bowel movements a day, much more often than the 1 every day or 2 that I used to have. According to Dr. John McDougal, the health, no meat, no dairy advocate I hear on the radio, increased easy bowel movements are easier on the body and normal in parts of the world where people eat primarily vegies, fruits, and grains. I don't usually bring this all up in conversation, but you asked, and I think it's important that people be aware of good health in all body functions. I think that they're all linked.\nSo I'd recommend anyone eat more grains, beans, veggies, and fruit.\nDate: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 23:56:00 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Children with Eczema\nMy son Saul had eczema from just a few weeks after birth until he was about two years old.\nMy dermatologist was able to get rid of Saul's problem by treating him with a combination of strong steriod ointment, antibiotics by mouth, and tar soaks in the bathtub. We continued this program for about two weeks per instructions, and Saul's eczema cleared up. It has never come back to any significant extent, although he occasionally has a bit of dry skin.\nThe antibiotic seems to be the crucial ingredient. Has that ever been tried for your daughter?\nDate: Wed, 24 Apr 1996 08:51:01 -0400 From: Carrie Subject: Children with Eczema\nOur daughter who is now six years old has had eczema since she was six months old. She is doing much better now that she is getting older and we are following a routine of two showers a week, lowila soap, and aveeno cream (in a jar not lotion in a bottle) every day twice a day. We do have to use steroid cream occasionally if she has a bad patch. We have only used antibiotics when she has scratched a spot to the point of infection. How long was your son on antiobiotics?\nDate: Wed, 24 Apr 1996 10:00:59 EDT From: Michael Subject: Eyelids\nBrenda asked how best to deal with eczematic eyelids. Many will know that topical steroids can have a thining effect on the skin and that some steroids are stronger than others. Only a doctor can properly advise which steroid is for which part of the skin but you may be interested in an extract from an article in Exchange (a few years back) by Dr Andrew Wright consultant dermatologist at Bradford (UK) Infirmary in which he divides topical steroids into five groups from strong to weak. I understand the weak ones are sometimes recommended for application to the face. His `weak' list includes the following:\nHydrocortisone 0.5% Cobadex Efcortelan Hydrocortisyl Neomedrone Mildison Timodene Terra-Cortril Hydrocal Dioderm Sential\nInterestingly, I have been prescribed Alphaderm for my face, which is from the next group of stronger drugs, but I have received no guidance on application to eyelids.\nDate: Wed, 24 Apr 1996 10:01:11 EDT From: Michael Subject: hypnotherapy\nMany thanks for your response regarding hypnotherapy. My interest was stimulated by a report on some research carried out at the Barnsley (UK) District General Hospital. (The report was published in the British Journal of Dermatology: 1995, Vol 132 pp778-83).\nDate: Wed, 24 Apr 1996 15:58:07 -0500 From: Julia Subject: Children with Eczema\nYes, we have used anti-biotics with our daughter and they did not have any partcular effect. To be frank, my head swims when I try to remember details of all the different treatments we have tried, when and for how long. This is one of the problems of being the parents of someone with eczema and, I suppose, having eczema. Because the condition is in a constant state of flux we are constantly searching for the right balance of treatment. If what we try isn't working to well we feel guilty for our failure.\nWe are lucky that what we are doing now seems to work (or is it just a phase, or is she growing out of it).\nDate: Wed, 24 Apr 1996 16:10:36 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Children with Eczema\nDo you recall what specific medicine it was, the dosage, and for how long she took it?\nI ask about the antibiotic because a drug of that class was so helpful for my son. Also they seem to help my own skin considerably. I'm taking Biaxin right now. It's a relative of Erythromycin, according to my doctor.\nDate: Wed, 24 Apr 1996 18:21:54 -0400 From: Francisco Subject: hypnotherapy\nMichael, Thanks for your comment. I am aware of the British study. Specifically refering to your experience, I have a couple of thoughts:\n1) It may take a while until you can see clear results, but\n2) Only about 15% of the adult population is very suceptible to hypnosis, that is capable of a deep trance. I am biased in that I believe that the highly hypnotizable are going to respond. Many other people in the field think that the depth of the trance is irrelevant for obtaining results. In a preliminary study with patients with psoriasis, only those highly hypnotizable subjects cleared their skin.\nDate: Wed, 24 Apr 1996 21:00:48 -0800 From: Ann Subject: misc. comments\nEverybody, This may be a dumb question or maybe I am just not informed on the Chinese Herbal Tea. If you can't drink the tea forever, and if it has potential liver damage as a side effect, what is the advantage of CHT over prednisone??? I seem to be allergic to every plant on the planet; so I stay away from anything \"herbal\" myself. But I'm just curious and, I must admit worried, that some forms of this tea are loaded with steroids.\nDiane, I, too, am often bright red. Sometimes after a major scratch session, my skin is so red that I can't tell what's bleeding and what isn't! You mentioned \"lotions\". I was told that many lotions are actually drying. (particularly the ones that feel cool; the cool feeling comes from water leaving the skin!) Creams and ointments are usually a better bet, but watch out for additives in the creams. I find that Eucerin creme (maybe because it is white) makes my skin look less red for a while anyhow. Vaseline seems to highlight the redness; I guess because it's shiny. Face redness is always a problem for me, even when my face isn't itching. I think most people think I'm having hot flashes!\nKristen, Awhile ago you said you had trouble finding a moisturizer that didn't contain irritants. I just remembered that my allergist had me trying food oils (olive oil, Crisco etc.) once because she said they were a lot purer that other lubes. Unfortunately, my skin is so very dry, only something really sticky like vaseline is helpful. Even the Crisco didn't work. I never tried margarine or butter.\nDate: Thu, 25 Apr 1996 19:37:24 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: misc. comments\nMy experience is that you take the CHT for a very limited period only (in my own case it was for about 20-25 days). I have only needed to take it again (for a shorter period) about every other year. I found that the effects of prednisone were much more short-lived. Can't comment on the steroid content - that's one disadvantage of taking a treatment prescribed by a Chinese when you are an English speaker. Describing the symptoms is about as far as it can go.\nDate: Thu, 25 Apr 1996 10:49:11 EDT From: Julia Subject: Children with eczema\nSorry I can't remember any details about the antibiotic. I sometimes can't remember what I'm supposed to be slapping on at the moment, let alone what I was doing a few months ago!\nDate: Thu, 25 Apr 1996 18:21:20 PST From: Wren Subject: misc. comments\nI admit, I don't know much about the CHT. I'll ask my CHT MD about possible liver damage. I asked her twice whether or not there were steriods in her ointment, and she said absolutely not. Don't know about the tea containing steriods, but I doubt it. Will ask.\nWhat I like about Chinese medicine is that it treats the cause, not just the symptoms, which is Western medicine's approach. I fully expect this condition to subside and go away from drinking the tea. Maybe I'm optomistic, but as someone who didn't have bad eczema, then acquired it by way of a systemic breakdown, feel that I can once again have good health and normal skin. I just felt that I had to find the right path, if you will, to the good health. Will keep you posted.\nAm a little itchier today, but that's always the case during my period.\nDate: Fri, 26 Apr 1996 15:26:10 EDT From: Julia Subject: LEMON RINDS\nI have a strange little book here called: twelve years with the Sufi Herb Doctors. Its author, one Najib Siddiqi, studied Sufi herbal medicine in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion of 1980. The book has a single paragraph about eczema:\nAll kinds of Sores, Eczema and other skin complaints are treated with lemon rinds which have been bruised and applied locally. I have seen conditions clear which according to their sufferers have been raging for several years, in one case over a quarter of a century.\nThat's it. I wonder if anyone out there has ever tried anything of this sort. A Pakistani friend whom I questioned about this matter had never heard of this remedy being applied in his community. He also told me that there are to his knowledge several varieties of lemon in Afghanistan so perhaps it's not too wise to go experimenting with your local variety. Does anyone know anything else about Najib Siddiqi. I contacted the publisher in London and they told me that he lives in the far East and they have no regular contact with him.\nDate: Fri, 26 Apr 1996 17:12:22 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Children with Eczema\nCarrie, My son was on antibiotics only for a short time - two weeks, I believe. I am speaking of oral antibiotics such as Erythromycin. There is a theory that eczema has something to do with bacteria, even when the eczema does not appear to be infected.\nDate: Fri, 26 Apr 1996 17:31:08 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: misc. comments\nAnn, Since my latest facial flare, I'm now on a burst of Prednisone, but keeping the redness and strange infection down are a daily battle. I've stopped using A&D ointment--think tar may be a problem--and am sticking only with Vit E oil and Crisco. I didn't like Crisco before because it didn't seem to lubricate anything, but I think it is more pure and more reliable. I'm really scared of any commercial lotions now. At least the Crisco battens down the dryness, but I'm not sure why I still am having reddened face. It kinda \"radiates\" if you know the sensation. I do have some white grease from my pharmacy that I think is safer than Vaseline. I've tested allergic to rubber, so am leery of tar products. I always preferred Vaseline in the past, but now am averse to its sticky heavy greasy attributes. Strange how one's preferences for meds change, but of course I know my skin has been through a lot of changes, too. Thanks for sharing your experiences with this stuff.\nDate: Fri, 26 Apr 1996 17:36:02 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Eyelids\nHi Michael, It was most interesting to me to read your list of \"weak\" steroids. I forwarded it to my derm dr. She put me on a weak facial steroid about ten years ago and I did well for a number of years. In the last few years I have been having strange facial bumpy edematous erythematous itchy sites that seemed to spread, and were resistant to everything I tried. Using OTC drying agents not only made it worse, but gave me a couple of severe facial flare ups with worse all-over edema. I think I am my own worst enemy in this facial battle!\nDate: Fri, 26 Apr 1996 17:47:24 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Children with eczema\nWhen I was younger, I literally could not afford to purchase meds prescribed by my doctor. So I went without. Health insurance has become hugely important to me as I age, since my cortisone overuse (esp facially) has become an acute problem. My derm doctor is at a loss as well, and I've been too careless with putting meds on my face without testing carefully in one little spot. My downfall was the 30-year, regular, daily, constant use in one place in particular--my face. I never used it as consistently anywhere else, and really have no acute eczema problems anywhere else now. Rotating of cortisone meds and strict follow up with a physician is highly critical, esp when you are dealing with a small child. I didn't start using cortisone until I was age 18. Good luck.\nDate: Sat, 27 Apr 1996 10:14:13 EDT From: Michael Subject: Hypnotherapy\nFrancisko, Many thanks for your note on hypnotherapy. I was encouraged by your knowledge of the British study and was interested to hear your thoughts about the therapeutic potential for those capable/incapable of deep trance. I am in the latter group but have been told this does not matter. In my case the treatment for atopic eczema coupled with 'anxiety scratching', often involving healthy skin, includes an anti-depressant drug although I was unaware I was depressed. However, there has been no improvement in nine months of treatment. I would be interested to hear of any successes with atopic patients.\nDate: Sat, 27 Apr 1996 11:53:56 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Hypnotherapy\nMichael, I just want to say that in my experience \"healthy skin\" can certainly itch. In fact, in my opinion that is the start of the cycle for all (well, at least for my own) eczema. Unbroken skin begins itching \"underneath\" and subsequently becomes damaged by scratching and perhaps by something in the eczematous process \"breaking through\".\nBut I definitely perceive the problem as starting below the surface. Personally, I don't think the itching is primarily psychological in origin.\nDate: Sat, 27 Apr 1996 21:23:19 -0400 From: Shelley Subject: left-handers\nI just read the following in a 1995 book called Roots of the Self, by Robert Ornstein. \"A study in Glasgow in 1982 found that left-handers were eleven and a half times more likely to have hay fever, asthma, and eczema, and an allergy clinic in London found that their patients were 70% more likely to be left-handed. It is fairly well-established that many problems of left-handers are connected with birth difficulties... Most at risk seems to be the immune system, which may be damaged by too much testosterone in the womb. Testosterone can also attack the thymus gland. People with a damaged thymus are far more likely to suffer from allergies like hay fever and asthma.\" I'm a right-hander but I found this interesting. Any left-handers out there?\nDate: Sun, 28 Apr 1996 21:13:32 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: Hypnotherapy\n>>Personally, I don't think the itching is primarily psychological in origin.<<\nNo, but the eczema does seem to have a psychological effect. I find that when my eczema becomes active, rather than lurking about on my hands which it does most of the time, I feel rather shaky and anxious, as if I'm nervous. There is never any concrete reason for these feelings. This can't be the cause of the eczema as otherwise the CHT would be unlikely to have the curative effect it does as it seems to be based on your medical condition (as far as I can judge - my herbalist has no English and we work through an interpreter whose own English is not 100%).\nPerhaps this is not strictly a psychological effect, but the result of an agent working on one's nervous system.\nHaving said that, I do tend to find that when my life seems to be getting out of control, the eczema tends to surface.\nDate: Sun, 28 Apr 1996 12:58:35 -0400 From: Shelley Subject: Redness\nDiane: The bright redness you describe sounds like infection or inflammation. I've heard of taking aspirin for inflammation. Also, soak in cold water, or put ice packs. If it's infected, you may need oral antibiotics or just use topical antibacterial soap or liquid.\nDate: Sun, 28 Apr 1996 10:58:41 -0800 From: Ann Subject: Wayne's Scale/ Fingernails\nWayne, Which way does your point scale go? Is 100 or 0 clear skin? I'd have a hard time rating myself because one area is often a lot worse than others and sometimes a mild area is itching me crazy while a more severe area is benign at the moment! \"Silent eczema\" is what I call skin that doesn't feel particularly uncomfortable. \"White eczema\" is dry flakey skin that isn't inflamed.\nEverybody, We have talked about the enormous amount of time that are skins require. One more complaint is the time it takes to keep nails short and smooth. I have strong and fast-growing nails ( probably from all that scratching). If I let them get any length at all, my skin goes downhill fast ( I do a lot of scratching while I am asleep; I undo any kind of glove or restraint without waking). If I try to get by with just clipping the nails, the sharp edges do their own damage. So obligatory manicures are one more thing to do!\nDate: Fri, 26 Apr 1996 06:02:18 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Hypnotherapy\nBrenda, I couldn't agree with you more. We could debate for years whether eczema is psychologically based, and never agree. In retrospect, I find myself more inclined to accept that psychology plays a huge part in eczema, one way or another. I would never have acceded to that theory even ten years ago, however. But I do remember feeling so terribly antsy when I was younger, and nothing helped except to \"bother\" my skin because I just didn't know what else to do with myself. I wish now I had tuned in to what was really going on in my life psychologically at that time.\nThe antsy anxieties would evolve regardless of any particular eczema status, but which came first, the chicken or the egg? That's why I now believe individual psychology is linked intrinsically with any one person's eczema and cannot be separated from it. I feel exceptionally fortunate for now because I haven't had acute eczema exacerbations (except when I went through an intense period of anger recently). I attribute this new quietude to a leveling off of my internal and external life to a plateau--even boredom is preferable to the eczema digs. I believe few of us ever sit down with ourselves and examine our inner lives. We are so busy chasing our tail and the clock it seems.\nDate: Sun, 28 Apr 1996 21:07:57 EST From: Wayne Subject: Wayne's Scale/ Fingernails\nI use the scale as a kind of \"objective\" tool to measure my skin condition. Every day I rate myself and enter the rating in my journal. The scale goes from 1 (the worst I have ever been) to 100 (the best it has been for me). So, you see, I'm not comparing my skin to someone else's.\nI do the best I can and give myself a overall score...it's kind of like olympic ice skating (!) I think it would be interesting for those of you with people living with you to have them score you as well, it may be more objective then. (Then, they may also move out).\nAnn, you made an excellent point about the possibility of steroids in the CHT. In the Dermatology Focus report Dr Sheehan seems to say that they checked the CHT concoction out for steroids and for their sample, they did not find any. My hospital checks me monthly with full blood and urine labs.\nThe speed your nails grow is also an indication of how skin is dealing with AD. I find that they grow faster (like Ann says) in the beginning, but if I have a full scale flare up my scratching will exceed the speed of nail growth and the nails become concave!\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 18:49:05 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: Wayne's Scale\nI know I'm not in much of a position to pronounce on what people with eczema should or should not do as mine is obviously not as bad as many on the list.\nHowever, one thing I have noticed is that when I was worrying furiously about and concentrating on my eczema it was a lot worse. When I found that control was possible (through CHT in my case) if I chose (and I only choose on rare occasions because of the difficulties involved), I was able to change my attitude and basically tell the eczema to \"get lost\". It doesn't, of course, but it is certainly not as bad as when I was constantly peering at my skin to see what was going to break out next.\nI do jut wonder if this sort of concentration on one's condition isn't counterproductive.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 19:38:06 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: Psychological causes\nMy own experience is that the eczema arose at a time when a major stress had been removed from my life, but on reflection this could have caused stresses of another type, and at the time I didn't know in which direction my life was going to be heading. As I mentioned in an earlier post, the concept of *control* seems to be very important. There could be a very real danger of allowing the eczema to take control of you. I still have a totally unsubstantiated conviction that the condition is primarily physical in origin, but the way in which we cope with it must, I feel, eventually affect the outcome.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 09:57:25 +0100 From: Dave Subject: extended courses of antibiotics\nOur son was prescribed Trimethoprim by a Consultant Dermatologist and she advised that he should remain on it continuously for periods of 3 months and more. The one time his General Practitioner agreed to this, his skin did seem to improve, (though as with everything to do with eczema and slow cures, this could be due to coincidence or something else). Unfortunately, since then, his GP has refused to prescribe anything other than 10 day courses which achieves nothing. I would be very grateful to hear of any research references.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 07:57:48 EDT From: David Subject: Left handers\nShelley, I have hay fever (or I should say \"seasonal allergic rhinitis\") and eczema. And I am left handed.\nMy wife is also left handed, but our two children are both right-handed. The children both have dry skin or mild eczema which can usually be controlled with emollients.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 09:02:07 -0400 From: Robert Subject: Left handers\nI am a converted right hander-I was born left handed and my parents changed me to right handed. I guess in a survey I would be categorized as 50/50.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 10:43:33 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: extended courses of antibiotics\nMy doctor has never mentioned Trimethoprim. He uses antibiotics like Erythromycin or Penicillin. Recently he has given me Biaxin, a relatively new drug as I understand it, related to Erythromycin. It has not been necessary to be on it for a long time; 10 days has been more than adequate. He also prescribes tar baths and topical steriods to be used at the same time.\nAs I mentioned, this combination actually \"cured\" my son. Of course, the eczema could come back later, but it's been about five years now and there have been only minor irritations since then. The latter we treat with topical steroids and they disappear.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 08:37:19 PST From: Wren Subject: misc. comments\nI used Home Health Products brand of cold pressed, cold processed castor oil as my lubricant for about 2 years. It soothed my skin while moisturizing. It is thick, but worked for me. I didn't find a commercial cream that I could use, though I didn't try Aquaphor.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 08:49:30 PST From: Greg Subject: Children with eczema\nI'd like to start a round of discussion about children with excema. And invite all to reply whether or not if affects you or one of your children if appropriate.\nMy son, who is 2 years old, had two spots of it on the backs of his knees from 1 month of age until about the age 1. Then it began to show up in place like his ear lobes, and behind his elbows. At age 1 1/2 it began to spread on his legs and arms and face. At the peak his arms legs and face were completely covered with oozing excema.\nWe treated him with cortisone ointment, and taking him off of eggs and dairy products. Our m.d. said excema is basically an allergic reaction akin to hay fever only manifested in the skin instead of the respitory system. The m.d. also did skin tests for environmental allergens and found that he reacted strongly to molds, mites, some grasses and trees. He also suggested we try Benadryl which is an antihistamine, and try using Dreft detergent as it is the only one that is almost hypoallergenic. We live where things are very damp and had a LOT of molds on our walls. We took the shotgun approach and did everything at once. We cleaned the molds, changed detergents, and modified his diet as I mentioned above. We found his excema then was cycling from almost well to just bad at times behind his knees. And we couldn't trace the improvements to anything really. We thought the benadryl did it but then it had no effect later, etc.\nNow he is worse than ever. And it has spread to his tummy and backside which it hadn't done before. Also under his neck is swollen and oozing and looks like he is 90 years old. Also under his eyes it has swollen and reddened a lot. He looks pretty pathetic.\nDuring the day he doesn't seem to bothered, but always at night between 12-4 he wakes up crying and scratching.\nSpecific questions I have are:\n1) What are the negatives about using cortisone? It seems to be the only thing that helps but we worry about it's use, especially after Kristen's note over the weekend.\n2) What are everyone's opinion about diet playing a role?\n3) What are everyone's opinion about enivironmental factors (mites, molds, etc.)\n4) Do a large number of kids grow out of this?\n5) Any thoughts on prenatal care and its influence? We are expecting another baby and my wife feels strongly that we could help the baby to come by working on her diet now and the babies diet from the get go. I am up for that but she has some pretty labor intensive ideas that I don't want to waste our time on if it isn't worth it.\nThanks for any input, things are really difficult now.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 08:53:07 PST From: Wren Subject: Nervous System and Eczema\nBrenda, I have the same experience. When my eczema is bad I am tense and feel nervous, even when there aren't obvious stressors in my life. This is almost the worst symptom for me, and is 80-90% alleviated with the CHT. I definitely feel as if the eczema is overtaking my whole system, with the itchy, sometimes oozy skin just one aspect.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 08:47:47 PST From: Wren Subject: left-handers\nMy sister does have hay fever, but has never had eczema. My brother has no hay fever or skin allergies, but is very allergic to bee stings. I inherited both skin and respiratory allergies, though the latter haven't surfaced in quite a few years (knock on wood). My family doesn't bear out that author's left-handed theory. I'll ask my sis if she remembers a particularly traumatic birth. I do know I was not breast fed, don't know about my siblings. I give much more credence the breast-fed, nonbreast-fed theory of eczema causation than handedness.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 09:07:56 PST From: Wren Subject: Psychological causes\nBrenda, I agree with your view that eczema is physical, or biochemical in origin. The effects can cause profound psychological upheaval as we've discussed, but I do believe for myself that my body is out of balance, and when in balance, I won't have this disease. That applies the the nervousness symptom as well. I believe that it is a physical reaction to some bodily chemical reaction, and does not stem from a psychological problem.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 09:13:32 PST From: Wren Subject: left-handers\nWhoops, forgot to say that sis is left handed, and my brother and I are both right handed. Mom, who has eczema only is right handed, and Dad, who has hay fever only, is right handed. Sounds like a puzzle in the Sunday paper.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 13:01:40 EDT From: Julia Subject: Psychological causes\nThe idea of a \"eczema\" personality worries me. It's a bit like blaming the victim.\nOur daughter has eczema since she was a baby (she's now 8), There's no doubt at all that stress effects the eczema and vice versa, but I suspect the relationship is quite complex.\nFor example, if she's worried or upset she'll scratch (can this be a kind of learnt/comfort behaviour?), her eczema will deteriorate, she'll have sleep patterns disturbed, she'll get run down or ill, her tiredness will mean she copes less well with stress so she'll scratch more. And so it goes on.\nAlso children (and adults) have to put up with ignorance about eczema. The fact that she has to put up with teasing about her skin and prejudice about it being catching surely must effect her confidence and self esteem.\n(By the way, I'm shocked that TV comics will joke about eczema - would that be OK for other debilitating conditions).\nIt is an interesting and important debate. I'm interested in hearing more from adults about how they dealt with teasing and ignorance as children. How can parents help their children?\nOh, and about the left-handed debate. Esme (our daughter) is right-handed, loves maths and numbers and (like most 8 year olds) is very creative\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 13:53:42 EDT From: Julia Subject: Children with eczema\nDear Greg, I'll give you our thoughts on your questions.\n1. We've been using steriods creams on Esme since she was a baby (now she's 8) We've tried other treatments (including homeopathy, CHT, porridge in the bath, dairy free diets) and nothing works but steriod creams. Our doctors have always been very reassuring about steriods and since nothing else works we choose to trust them on this point. In the last few months we have been using \"wet wraps\" which I think is quite new here in the UK and they make a massive difference. Are wet wraps a treatment that you've been offered? If not let me know andI'll describe it.\n2. Diet: Didn't work for us but probably worth trying.\n3. Environmntal factors: I haven't heard of molds. Feather beds and pets make Esme worse.\n4. Most kids do grow out of it. I sincerely hope your boy does. Only those of us directly effected know how devastating it can be for the individual and their families. At times I felt that Esme's eczema so dictated our lives that we weren't a \"proper\" family somehow. I used to stare at the pattern of eczema on her body feeling sure that it held some sort of clue and if I could work out what it was I'd know how to cure it.\n5. No thoughts on pre-natal care. Esme was breast fed exclusively till about 5 months then with other things till she was over a year.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 16:45:28 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Children with eczema\nGreg, I feel really sad reading this about your son. I hope he can get some help.\nNotice that everything your pediatrician has suggested has accomplished exactly nothing. That is what happened with our pediatrician, too; he just kept recommending ineffectual things. I don't think most pediatricians are well trained in this area.\nWe finally took my son to a dermatologist and he was cured in about two weeks! I know I'm repeating myself, since I've described this on the list just recently. My apologies to anyone who's getting bored with this story.\nThe dermatologist put Saul on tar baths, topical steroids (Diprolene), and antibiotics by mouth.\nThis same combination has worked wonders for my own eczema, and it did for Saul's, too. He has not had a significant recurrence since that treatment. He was two when he was treated, and is now seven.\nAlthough I'm enthusiastic about this program of treatment, I guess it's possible that the method doesn't work for everyone with eczema, and that Saul and I have (not surprisingly) the same kind of eczema, so it has worked for both of us.\nMy eczema has not gone away, but it's much better for many weeks after the treatment I've described. The antibiotic seems to be the key. I experience significant improvement when taking Biaxin even without the other components of the treatment. And Saul's problem has never come back, except for minor itchiness and dryness once or twice a year, very easily cleared with Diprolene for a day or two.\nI think using topical steroids by themselves over extended periods of time can lead to significant problems. The skin seems to be weakened by the stuff. It also worsens infection, in my experience, when used for a long time without antibiotics.\nI have never seen any convincing evidence that diet has anything at all to do with this.\nIf your child is allergic, I think it makes sense to remove as many allergens as possible from the environment, without going overboard. This might or might not help the eczema, but it certainly can't do any harm.\nI believe there is good evidence that occlusive bed coverings can help prevent dust mite problems. I use them on my bed, and have been thinking of getting them for my kids' beds too. The company I buy from, called National Allergy Supply, will send you a nice catalog if you call (800) 522-1448. The bed coverings (\"Satin Soft\" type) go under the ordinary sheets and pillowcases; they are not hot or sticky.\nI have read that many children do grow out of it, but I don't know the details.\nI don't know anything about a prenatal connection, and I am personally skeptical that there is anything to that idea. It's all black magic. How would you know what to change in the diet, anyway? Good nutrition, avoiding drugs of any kind, and the usual prenatal vitamins seem to be the logical course of action on that one.\nWith respect to post-natal care, the only thing I have heard is that breast feeding may be better than bottle feeding, but again I think it is speculative. In the case of breast milk, though, at least we have nature on our side: this is what babies are \"supposed\" to drink.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 17:04:25 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Wayne's Scale/ Fingernails\nAnn, I've cut my fingernails down to the quick for years now--just to keep me from infecting and digging up myself. My fingers are of course stubby appearing, and I keep my hands out of sight as much as possible, but it's a small price to pay for reduced infection and reduced ability to scratch. I really haven't missed not having long fingernails minus any esthetics, of course.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 17:35:48 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Wayne's Scale\nIt's no easy matter to tell anyone in the throes of virulent eczema to keep their mind off it, because that is impossible. But I do know my own anxiety about my skin seemed to feed on itself, and I also know that the stresses within the family dynamics in my youthful home were highly detrimental to my skin problem. That's not to say that everyone with eczema is living in a highly stressed emotional environment, but it's a factor that should not be overlooked. Parental guilt and stresses and any other emotional factors will affect their children with eczema. There is just no way around that. Trying to pinpoint and change all that for the better has got to be frustrating, but it is still a definite factor in the skin problem. Eczema can just drive a person nuts, so I know it's no easy thing to tell someone their psychological make up is a factor. The only way I could eliminate the stresses in my life was to remove myself from most of them--not what most people would choose as a way of life. It was necessary for me.\nEven though I'm now dealing with cortisone overuse because I lost touch with a reliable dermatologist for ten years, in no way means I would have passed up the opportunity to use cortisone as long as I did. It was the only drug of choice after 20 years of absolute misery. The use of cortisone just needs diligent scrutinization and monitoring by a competent dermatologist. If some of you parents are seeing a GP, forget the GP for derm problems. Find your child a real dermatologist. You really are doing your child a disservice by allowing a GP to \"treat\" him or her. I will never regret using cortisone for the years of freedom it gave me.\nIf your child is being teased and shamed about his/her skin, pls sit down with your child and help your child to realize that basic self-esteem is not tied just to one's outer appearance. A human being is more than just his/her skin. Make your child as comfortable as you can physically, help your child to accept his/her limitations, but never compromise your child's self-esteem just because his or her skin doesn't look like everyone else/s. Counseling for your child may not hurt either. Indwelling thinking because of eczema is too easy; it's important to see the bigger picture of your child's life and not just the skin problem. Help your child transend his or her physical condition. Keep his or her mind off the skin, whatever you have to do. Self-hate comes too easily to kids with eczema. They need to love themselves, no matter if their skin isn't perfect. I empathize with the pain you must have for your child, but don't let it conquer your spirit.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 17:55:44 -0500 From: Kristen Subject: Psychological causes\nSorry if I gave you the impression that there is such a thing as an eczema personality. That's not it at all. I was born with eczema and lived in hell my entire growing up years. I can say now that I know my home environment was highly detrimental to my emotional and skin health because of the circumstances I happened to be born into. It was nothing more than rotten luck. Of course, blaming is totally futile, so one needs to get past that and take a hard, honest look at the real emotional and physical environment one is living in. I don't minimize this factor at all; I just believe it is much more important than most of us want to admit to ourselves.\nEczema has a way of driving us all frantic while we chase after moonbeams of \"cures\" for which there are none. The secret of our disease lies entirely within ourselves. No one else has the key, and except for cortisone, there is no reliable medication that works all the time. We all need to stop looking for utopian cures and pay attention to ourselves and what our body is telling us. I can say this in hindsight because I've been there. That doesn't help those of you coping NOW, but instead of racing around on the merrygoround, get off it and take the measures that make the most sense for your family and your lifestyle. If you don't, you will find yourself controlled by the eczema to the exclusion of everything else that's important in your life. Eczema will whip you around its finger and you will come to hate and resent it even more than you already do. It's easy to hate yourself when you have eczema. It's a huge psychological hurdle to beat that. Cope one day at a time instead of letting a future with eczema drive you nuts with worry. And get competent dermatological care. There's no substitute for that.\nDate: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 21:04:52 -0800 From: Ann Subject: 2 focus or not 2 focus etc.\nBrenda, If not focusing closely on your skin helps, keep it up! But I know from my own experience with skin and other chronic problems that journaling and grading each day gives one a sense of control and also compartmentalizes the problem. \"There, I've written my notes about my skin, now I can get on with something else.\" Also, if you're having a bad day, it can be helpful to look back to read about an even worse day and realize that you have survived worse flares than the one at hand. My allergist encouraged me to do this type of thing hoping to find a pattern relating to weather, pollen counts, diet etc. Personally, if I don't focus on my skin, I subconsciously start scratching and spend more time and energy and do more damage than when I'm focusing. Everyone's different.\nGreg, I'm sorry to hear your son is having a rough time now. This is the time of year my skin got so bad when I was his age. I like what I heard about your doctor; he/she recognizes that pollens can play a major role in eczema. Testing you son early was a good idea; maybe he can get allergy shots when he is old enough. They are really helping me now. I don't have any definite answers to your questions, but I have read that most babies/toddlers with eczema outgrow it. I was real severe as a baby and toddler; just had patches in childhood and young adulthood; went somewhat downhill in my early thirties; got better; became covered with eczema including wild facial flares in my mid forties. I didn't get allergy tested until I was 48 and then started shots. I think if I had started the shots earlier, I might have avoided my recent rough years.\nEverybody, I think I forgot to tell you about something that maybe helped my skin once. I messed up my shoulder while weight training. The doctor put me on Naprosin, a nonsteroidal antiinflamatory drug. My skin got much better while I was on it. This was about 5 yrs. ago; but I thought I would mention it in case anyone else experienced the same effect.\nDate: Tue, 30 Apr 1996 19:39:39 +1200 From: Brenda Subject: 2 focus or not 2 focus etc.\nYou're right of course. The key thing here has to be the concept of \"control\". We can only follow what works for us individually, whether it's to ignore or catalogue. Whichever way we handle it, you have to take notice of what Kristen Zehner says in another post that you must not let the eczema take control of you.\nDate: Tue, 30 Apr 1996 14:03:59 +0100 From: Lesley Subject: Children with eczema\nOur daughter developed ezcema at 6 weeks (My husband has asthma and ezcema so it was expected). Over the last 2 years the ezcema has moved around her body: started on tummy and face, then went to knees and ankles - I.eczema. to whichever bit she can really scratch. Last summer was dreadful with skin infection after skin infection, stronger steoids and oral antibiotics helped to break the cycle and allow us to moisturise the skin.\nAt first she was treated with hydocortisone .5 and 1% creams and ointments, emoiluments (I hate this word as I can't spell it) and moisturisers were prescribed. I now use Balneum PLUS - in the bath - it is supposed to have an anti-itching property, and Dibrobase ointment rather than cream as this seams to rehydrate the skin better. Here in England there are actually special dermatological washing detergents: BOOTs the Chemist have there own range (which I use), Marks and Spencers do a 'sensitive skin' one and so do some supermarkets 'SURCARE'. I do not use fabric conditioner and I always put the clothes through an extra rinse cycle. I wash everything in this detergent not just Nicky's clothes - when she was a tiny baby and the ezcema was on her hands and face I realised that these areas were coming in contact with our own clothes which I was washing in a biological detergent.\nLast year I bought a CURADERM sleep suit - 100% cotton with integral hands and feet and a zip up the front. It cost 30 approx but was money well spent - Nicky CANNOT scratch at night, (the suit can be voiled to sterilise it) She's been wearing them for a year now in bed and you can almost see the relief on her face when we put it on her now. I know how well it works because she was ill last month and threw up on both her suits so she had to wear pjs - she scratched and kicked all night long. The suit helped break the cycle by allowing the skin to recover at night.\nI worry about steroids too , but it does seem to be the only thing that breaks a bad cycle, however I was told by a doctor to wean the dose down and not suddenly stop applying twice a day because the skin was better.\nNicky has uticaria reactions to cows milk products, raw potato (so does ED), and eggs. Since she has been on a completely dairy and egg free diet - that means checking every label to ensure no lactic acid, caesenates, lethicin etc are in anything she eats, her skin is much better...although it still itches the cuts repair quicker which means less chance of an infection.\nI asked about diet when I was pregnant with Nicky, the doctors were pretty dismissive of diet during pregnancy because of the need for calcium for the expectant mum.\nDate: Tue, 30 Apr 1996 10:29:33 -0400 From: Robert Subject: hunger vs. itch\nI find that I often eat to get my mind off itching...I correlate low eat times with non-itching.\nDate: Tue, 30 Apr 1996 07:49:37 PST From: Wren Subject: Wayne's Scale/ Fingernails\nI've been a little all over itchier lately- maybe a 70 on the Wayne scale. Don't know whether it's because my MD changed the CHT recipe or because my body's hormones are off. Anyway, at the moment I'm happy to report I'm about a 96%. Can't believe it.\nDate: Tue, 30 Apr 1996 11:37:38 -0400 From: Robert Subject: Eczema research\nJust getting to your note....interesting that you also were cleared up with goats milk as a baby, I was also. This may be useful for those with youngsters to try.\nDate: Tue, 30 Apr 1996 17:54:56 -0400 From: Shelley Subject: Fingernails & Lucid Dreaming\nAnn: So true about the problems of fingernails. Mine also grow fast and as you said, even when they are cut short, the slightest rough edge can do damage. I just did some damage in my sleep last night, I think due to the current heat wave we're having in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is normally quite cool. I just cut my nails two days ago, cut to the nub and filed, but I do damage by pressing as hard as I can against that one tiny edge. It's like getting out of prison with a tiny file. I work with whatever tools I've got. And in my sleep it takes longer to stop. But I do better now than I used to do. I've trained myself, through lucid dreaming techniques (learned from Patricia Garfield's book Creative Dreaming) to recognize what I'm doing and get myself to stop. Anyone who does a lot of scratching while they're asleep might benefit from learning lucid dreaming...\nDate: Tue, 30 Apr 1996 19:10:48 EDT From: Julia Subject: Children with eczema\nAs recounted in a previous letter: we have tried in vain to discern a pattern in the fluctuations of our daughter's eczema. The only feature that we have found to be indicative of the condition of her skin is: sweat. We can say quite definitely that if her skin is good she will sweat; if the eczema is out of control she will not sweat no matter how high the temperature.\nLast Summer was one of the hottest on record and the eczema ravaged her skin throughout those long scorching months.\nOn perhaps the hottest day of August, we had a few hours to kill so we decided to spend them in Kew Gardens. The day was so hot that believe it or not we sought refuge in the cooler confines of one of the Tropical houses! The sweat was rolling off everyone around, but not off Esme.\nIs this failure of the skin's natural cooling system linked to the eczema or is it an entirely seperate condition?\nCopyright of the individual messages rests with those who posted them.

(I no longer sleep with socks sewn to the ends of my pj's to keep from itching. I don't really itch. I've been waiting to say this because I don't want to encourage a relapse by bragging.)\nWho knows exactly what is helping the most.

I believe the milk thistle are a boon, as they help to repair the liver.\nMy theory about my body is that after 20 years of using topical steroids, and 6 weeks of using oral ones last summer (to combat the flare I caused by quitting the topicals cold turkey), my liver wanted to speak its mind and did so through my skin. My herbalist pals tell me milk thistle supports and repairs the liver. After investing a million dollars and hours in vitamins, blood tests and every other possible natural cure, I think they are it. Good, that is. And good luck to all who try this.\nDate: 9 Feb 1997 19:02:47 From: Amy Subject: scalp\nI don't think many remedy shampoos work once the eczema digs into your scalp -- I've seen two heads, my own and another that bear the evidence. The one thing that helps is putting jojoba oil on it. Jojoba oil is very expensive, but some health food places sell it in bulk, and you don't need very much.\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 09:38:17 From: Jessica Subject: Julia's infant eczema\nDebbie, I am so happy for you and for Julia. Would you like to share with us what did you/or chiropractor do to make this amazing improvement?\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 10:28:26 From: Brigit Subject: Misc\nA few unrelated things:\nThere's a Web site where you can \"Search for the pharmaceutical of interest by first character of name\", at http://www.rxmed.com/prescribe.html. I tried it on a few items; many of the \"official\" ones (Eucerin, Lac-Hydrin, Aveeno, Eurax etc.) are there, but the \"alternative\" health-food store ones (Simicort, Herpacine) are not.\nCan anyone confirm or invalidate my suspicion that the \"special ingredient\" in Eucerin, which is Eucerit, is also in good old Nivea cream? All I can find about Eucerit is that it's a special form of lanolin/wool wax alcohol. No idea what's so special about it.\nAveeno Powder is 100% colloidal oatmeal. Now, what does \"colloidal\" in colloidal oatmeal mean?\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 11:25:43 From: Royce Subject: Misc\nI tried Semi-cort because a few people said that it worked wonders. I thought it worked okay but there are a lot of ingredients in it (I think one of which is not the greatest for my skin) so I can't use it for a long period of time. I switch off with cortisones, zinc oxide ointment and zinc pyrithione 2%. Has anyone else had any luck with Semi-cort?\nI can't use Nivea or Eucerin so maybe it does have at least one of the same ingredients.\nThe dictionary says that \"colloidal\" is a substance made up of tiny insoluble, nondiffusible particles that remain suspended in a medium of different matter.\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 11:18:15 From: Heather Subject: Eczema & wedding dress: need support!\nI'm getting married in August, and my grandmother has asked me if I would like to have her make my dress. I'm thrilled, but I don't like this feeling of shame that I have regarding my eczema. It's not weeping; it just looks like patchy, dry red spots. I do manage to keep it under control (it's always worse during winter and during certain times of the month), but I *can't stand* the looks of consternation on my relatives' faces when they see it. My mother always has a new theory about why it flares up, and other people ask why it hasn't gone away, etc. I know that they love me and want to see me well, but I don't want them to bring it up. There's a tremendous lack of eczema information out there, I guess.\nAnyway, I just wanted to know if anyone can empathize with what I'm feeling. I don't know what condition my eczema will be in on the day of the wedding, so that has limited my choices of dress styles (I don't trust my back/arm eczema enough to wear a sleeveless dress with a low back, but then co-workers ask my why I would want to wear a dress with short sleeves in hot weather, etc.). I've also felt painfully self-conscious in the bridal salons I've been in, worried that the sales assistant was looking at the spots on my arms.\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 11:09:37 From: Patsy Subject: Eczema & wedding dress: need support!\nHeather- for all people who ask terribly personal and none-of-their-business questions, I would respond, \"Why in the world would you want to know that?\" This works especially well in public places if said in a slightly louder than normal voice. For some reason, it seems to make them realize they are poking their noses...\nEczema is just a part of who you are, and you are certainly more than eczema (one would assume your beloved didn't make his decision to propose based on how much you itch!). None of us would have selected this condition if given our druthers, but this is what we've got. I'd say that eczema will be the least of your problems once you're married, but then I'm divorced so my outlook might be a shade jaded!\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 12:55:45 From: Donna Subject: Eczema & wedding dress: need support!\nI wonder why they feel it is any of their business... And why you feel you owe them an explanation... I know women who, for religious regions, never wear sleeveless garments.\nAnyways, a way around this is to have the sleeves made out of lace -- it will give you the coverage you seek, yet be cool in the summer.\nSo what if the sales assistant is looking? YOU are the one spending the money, if she indicates she has a problem with your skin condition, YOU indicate that you have enough of a problem with her attitude to consider taking your business elsewhere...\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 13:05:42 From: Wendy Subject: Eczema & wedding dress: need support!\nWhen I got married I got on prednisone for it. I figured that those will be pictures we will look at for the rest of our lives so I wanted to look normal. I know what you mean about trying on dresses. I was very self-conscious about it. Fortunately I found a dress that I loved on the first visit. Anyway, it is true what you said that you can never tell how bad it is going to be. That is why I took the prednisone. And of course, my skin hasn't looked that good since! Ah well. Good luck!\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 10:58:21 From: Kim Subject: Eczema & wedding dress: need support!\nWhy not have a theme for your wedding then you can wear a dress that covers you and just say you like \"traditional\" or whatever. Then get yourself something slinky to wear at before or after wedding activities, so you can pick when you think your skin is at its best. I understand my mom always has another cause for my son's eczema and if he has skin out for people to see they think I let him get a sunburn, I want to say, mind your own business we are doing the best we can.\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 11:07:52 From: Toby Subject: colloidal Oatmeal\nI think but am not positive that \"colloidal\" means that the oatmeal is ground up and processed so tiny that it acts like it dissolves in your tub. Actually what I've used instead with similar results is: Take a piece of cheesecloth, put oatmeal (I used organic when I could) in it and tie it up tight. Now put it in your tub. It is just as soothing as Aveeno and a lot less expensive. You can just toss it out or compost it when your done. I used to take at least one oatmeal bath a day and it was the only time I felt comfortable in my skin. Great expression: Feeling comfortable in one's skin. I wish it to everyone on the list!\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 11:28:37 From: Ann Subject: wedding day eczema\nHeather, First of all CONGRATULATIONS. I hope you 2 have a lifetime of happiness which clears your skin forever!\nAs Wendy suggested, consider prednisone as this is a very special day. I've used it (or amped up my topical drugs) for less honorable occasions, if ya know what I mean! What ever dress or medication you choose, I think it is wise to have one stock phrase for those who comment on your skin. I forgot who suggested \"Why are you concerned about that?\" , but I think it's perfectly brilliant. You can choose a tone of voice to suit your mood and/or the status of the questioner. And whether you put the emphasis on the word YOU or THAT also varies the spin. Once you are prepared with a simple comeback, you will be more relaxed and able to enjoy dress hunting and also the big day. I bet you'll look so good at your wedding, no one will even think about your eczema!\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 14:23:09 From: Marilyn Subject: Eczema & wedding dress: need support!\nCongratulations on your wedding plans! And I'm so sorry you feel that awful self-consciousness... the last time I went dancing, one of my partners backed away when he felt my hands (strategically bandaged!) and said \"I have to ask... is that contageous?\" Turned out he was a dentist -- (I laughed and explained, but notice I have not been dancing since.)\nI have recently tried smiling and saying \"eczema\" when I get \"that look\" -- and to my surprise, I have met so many other people who have it, who have family members who have it -- I had no idea it was so widespread. So I would recommend being up front with someone like a dressmaker or sales clerk -- their job is to help you find a dress to let the inner beauty shine through, and I expect they will all have good suggestions for your outer looks as well if you let them know what you're up against. (I notice, with new understanding, how beautiful my mother looked in 1945 in her long-sleeved \"old fashioned\" gown!) And while I'm at it, think I'll revive the fashion for wearing elegant gloves to a dance!\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 14:56:13 From: Royce Subject: Eczema & wedding dress: need support!\nHeather- Congratulations! I'm also getting married this summer and I absolutely LOVE this list and I am sooo happy that you wrote in about this. Sometimes this condition makes me feel so alone in the world and it is nice to know that there are others that can empathize. I think some of us with eczema live somewhat parallel lives. I have the same type of situation with my family.\nI actually picked out a dress for my wedding. It's a simple, off the shoulder short sleeve dress and I am praying that my skin is clear for the big day. Everytime I went to go shopping for a dress my skin would decide to flare up and become a lovely shade of sunburnt looking red (really bright against those white dresses).\nMy family is very supportive but sometimes they say hurtful things and don't even realize what they're saying My father suggested that I make a drappy scarf out of the material from the dress to put around my neck because I have these brown lines as a result of overuse of steroid creams. He didn't realize it but that made me even more self-conscious than I already am. Everyone used to try & make me feel better by saying that I was the only one who noticed it and now I realize that it's not necessarily true. I am super sensitive about my eczema and when it's bad I feel disgusting. One thing I am definitely grateful for is my supportive fiance. He never thinks it looks bad (or so he says).\nI'm going to the hair salon next week for some trial wedding hairdos and I am afraid that the woman is going to be kind of disgusted by my scaly scalp. My eczema is the worst there right now. Usually this is a place no one can see; it figures that it's bad now when someone will need to concentrate on this area.\nI don't mean to sound like \"woe is me\" I know things can be worse than this but it is a big time in a person's life and I hope that out of all the people out there the ones on this list will understand.\nGood luck with your wedding plans and remember that there is at least one other person out there who can totally empathize. Thanks for making me feel like I'm not alone.\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 16:03:06 From: Karen Subject: Eczema & wedding dress: need support!\nMy daughter (age 2-1/2) has eczema and complete strangers are always asking questions about it, so I can empthasize with your self-consciousness.\nI encourage you to select the wedding gown that you'd feel most comfortable with and not worry about what friends and relatives think. After all, it is YOUR wedding!\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 16:10:22 From: Heather Subject: colloidal Oatmeal\nThanks for the oatmeal tip. I was going to try grinding some oatmeal in the food processor, but maybe I won't go through the bother. Or maybe I will, and do a comparison test.\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 19:53:23 From: Christopher Subject: Eczema & wedding dress: need support!\nDonna is right; if people have problems with your eczema, let them deal with it. It is YOUR problem, not theirs, and is NONE of their business. I've been asked all of my life about mine, and it hurts sometimes (because it is so embarassing), but I've learned to deal with it (as you obviously have). Simply tell them what it is, and if they ask any further, take your business elsewhere. You don't have to put up with people's crap. Trust me, I know this from experience.\nAnother bit of advice. If, and when you begin to really not care about what people think of your eczema, that is when most will begin to ignore it. It is some psychological thing, I believe. I noticed that when I thought my eczema was some horrible, demonic thing, I rarely if ever dated (and incidentally, it flared up more!). When I began to really not even care about it, I began dating this absolutely gorgeous girl (and its flare-ups decreased). The more YOU care about it, the MORE others will care about it. At least, that is what I have noticed, though I am probably wrong, but at least that is my observation.\nDate: 10 Feb 1997 22:10:57 From: Marilyn\nI hate these looks too. I dumped a friend largely because she was so goopy feel-sorry-for-me it made me sick. And she always had new stupid theories to make me feel bad, make me feel like I had to follow her out-of-the-blue ideas. It's domineering to offer those theories. Tell them to stop it, that they don't have a clue. One guy was making up theories to me and I told him that I have this list for talking about my rash. I don't need his concern, thank you very much.\nI was thinking of making a paste of zinc oxide and hypoallergenic brownish lipstick for covering the rash but my eczema has subsided so much that I don't even use much zinc oxide anymore.\nSometimes I think that my eczema is really everyone else's problem nearly as much as it is mine because they have to look at it -- and on your wedding day, it's their tough luck. The day belongs to *you* and your intended and nothing else matters.\nBest wishes for a wonderful life together.\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 04:42:17 From: Brigit Subject: Heather- wedding dress\nThis sounds like a clear case of lace to me. How about whichever dress you fancy with a lace wrap on top? If your eczema shows on the big day, you pin the wrap on with a brooch, if not, you just nonchalantly put it on and take it off as you wish.\nBTW: I agree that if you tell people you have eczema, more often than not they say things like, Oh, I used to have it, but fortunately I outgrew it; or, Yes, Isn't that awful, my daughter has it, or things like that. Most people really are not malicious, they simply do not know. And more than you would think do know, and react quite sympathetically.\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 08:53:18 From: Donna Subject: colloidal Oatmeal\nA colloidal 'solution' is not a solution in the true sense, as the particles are in fact suspended in the liquid, and not dissolved -- but the particles are so tiny that it SEEMS to dissolve.\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 10:09:58 From: Royce Subject: scalp\nThanks to everyone who gave recommendations for the scalp problem I'm experiencing. It has been an ongoing problem for years. Sometimes it will clear up but it usually comes right back. I just went to the dermatologist last night and he gave me a sample of Temovate .05% (Clobetasol propionate .05% in a base of purified water, isopropyl alcohol & carbomer 934P & sodium hydroxide). I'll let you know how that works for me.\nAnother thing... My derm. also said that they just found out that Head & Shoulders is just as effective as the Nizorol shampoo that he prescribed for me the last time I was there... interesting.\nAlso, I just figured out that I'm allergic to Polypropylene Glycol which is in the majority of medications my doctor prescribed to me for all these years. I discovered this while using DeSowen lotion- after using it on my face & other areas of my body for over a year. My doctor raved about this stuff because it is weak enough to be used on the face. He seemed to be happy that I figured out (or at lease I think I figured out) one of the culprits but he also seemed a little embarrassed (or maybe even mad).\nI'm pissed that my DOCTOR actually caused part of the problem. It makes me wonder why they don't test things on each patient (especially people with such sensitive skin) before just prescribing things at random. As we all know, and you would think all doctors would know, we all react differently to things. I guess I should be smart enough to test new products in one spot before putting it all over but I get anxious and I want to try to make my skin better right away. Sorry, just venting.\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 12:04:29 From: Debbie Subject: Julia's infant eczema\nThe chiropractor seems like he's just rubbing and gently pushing specific spots while she's positioned a few different ways:\nMe sitting, her leaning against me chest to chest\nShe lies chest down across my lap\nShe lies on her side.\nJulia doesn't mind it (doesn't hurt) until she's on her side because she's freaked out by strangers, doctors, etc. He does a little bit more each time. And if one area has drastically improved he focuses on another area. All 3 areas of the spine actually have vertebrae affecting/affected by the stomach/liver area. Apparently, the causal relationship between the two (spine & stomach) can go either way: stomach damage can short circuit the spine or a misalignment can mess up the stomach.\nI'm trying to work on it from both ends. Searching for things (easy-to-digest foods, supplements, minerals, vitamins, homeopathic remedies... MAYBE medication, though less likely) to help repair stomach, intestinal, liver areas. Plus treating the misalignment.\nHer face started clearing for 3 days on her own (no cortisone), yet wasn't sleeping due to \"all-over-itchies.\" Looks like a sensation of bugs crawling all over you. So I resorted to Benadryl for a few nights as a crutch to help break the cycle. But if she's really itchy the antihistimine doesn't do a thing--she'll still wake up all night.\nAnyway, this weekend she was completely clear for the first time ever!!!!! In all, it was a total of 9 days in a row of gradual improvement and great sleep. Then the next 3 days were a gradual downhill. She had a disastrous itching fit in the car yesterday. Earlier in the day yesterday, she saw the chiropractor. He was concerned that she was pretty tight again, out of the blue. (Her face still looked real good at this point so he wasn't just reading her.) He hadn't really expected that. Although he did tell me to expect a few more cycles of good and bad times before healing. (Just like with homeopathy.)\nThis wasn't a big shock to me since she was showing other signs of stomach distress at home: squirming all over when nursing again, etc... Hmmmm. Two things I did differently at the end of the good cycle were: Let her eat a few things she hasn't had all month and visited a house with a dog again (last 2 itching fits were while visiting a \"dog\" household and patting their dog.).\nI've been noticing a 3 day cycle to the \"bad\" times. Today is day 4 and she is better so far. She's still way better than before---hasn't gone that far backwards. And she's nursing normally today. So we'll see. I did have the chance to whisk her off to a Portrait studio on her best day--so I had some luck there. I was able to get a beautiful one year old portrait for her birthday! I hate to sound vain about surface looks, etc. but it is important. I want her to look back on her babyhood and not just see eczema in every picture!\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 19:05:49 From: Peter Subject: scalp\nRoyce, You may want to try Satina 'D' wash lotion - it's good for all over the body and it helped me clearing my scalp problem (most of it). It's manufactured by Bayer, Germany and free of polypropylene glycol. The liter bottle (green front) is sold at approx USD 16.- in the pharmacy. Keep your hair very short while using it.\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 10:14:43 From: Ann Subject: polypropylene glycol\nRoyce, Don't apologize for being angry at a doctor! That's one reason we have this list -- so we can vent our feelings without offending professionals on whom we must rely. I have been fortunate to have doctors who always prescribe ointments rather than creams. Ointments (in general) don't contain things like polypropylene glycol. All doctors SHOULD know this and should only prescribe creams (or lotions or gels) for allergic people when the greasiness of ointments can not be tolerated.\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 10:18:20 From: Ann Subject: The Riddle of The Itch\nHere's something I've pondered for most of my lifetime. No doctor, pharmacist or other expert has been able to give me a definite answer. Is it safer to use huge amounts of a low potency steriod ointment or tiny amounts of a highly potent one? Anybody got an opinion?\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 13:32:33 From: Shelley Subject: Eczema & wedding dress: need support!\nHeather, the lace suggestion sounds like a good idea to me. If lace isn't good for some reason, then experiment with other light materials to cover up yet be cool. I'm sure you can figure out something that will be at least tolerable.\nBut mainly I just wanted to offer some emotional support for what is certainly a difficult situation. I know what a big deal it is. The stress is high enough without eczema! You are right to remember that you don't know how your skin will be that day. Sure your skin could be broken out, but it could be really good because you'll be so happy, right? Try to set up the situation so that you have lots of little reminders that you're happy to be taking this step. No matter what condition your skin is in, the important thing to focus on is the wedding. Do whatever you can do to keep your focus off your skin so that whatever its condition, it won't take centerstage.\nOne of my sisters still had braces on her teeth when she got married, and I remember how upset she was, moaning about how the photos were going to be terrible, practicing smiling without showing her teeth, etc. Everybody I know who's gotten married has worried about their wedding being ruined by something. Just do the best you can do and keep talking about your fears with your loved ones. When you get overwhelmed, post another message like you did, that's what we're here for. Don't suppress how you feel. Let it out, and let it go as much as possible. You'll get through this...\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 14:25:37 From: Royce Subject: polypropylene glycol\nI also thought that polypropylene glycol was not used in ointments but my dr. was going through all his little sample boxes and found that every one of them contained that ingredient.\nAt the moment I'm not using cortisone because my skin is pretty much under control except for a few small areas and the usual dry, slightly itchy skin that I don't think will ever go away (I use emollients & zinc for this). I'm not sure what he'll find for me if I need a cortisone cream in the future (which unfortunately I'm sure I will) but I'm not too worried about it... yet. I would really appreciate it if you or anyone else who may know of of a cortisone that doesn't contain polypropylene glycol could let me know the name(s).\nI've been using various cortisone creams, ointments... my whole life. I'm not positive but I think I just developed an allergy to this within the past couple of years.\nAlso, is anyone allergic to glycine/glycerine? I think I am but my doctor says that it's not possible (I think it's possible for me to be allergic to ANYTHING).\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 14:53:44 From: Brian Subject: The Riddle of The Itch\nI believe that the rule of thumb is to consider the combination of time and potency. A lower potency steroid could be taken for a longer period. In other words potency1 * time1 = potency2 * time2. If potency1 is lower than potency2 then time1 is greater than time2. Whether or not it is safe is relative to your point of view regarding the long term effects of using steroids.\nI was using a very potent steroid for about 4 months last year. Then I started receiving this mailing list. I use Lubriderm as a moisturizer (my doctor's suggestion) and Clotriminazole 1% (I got that tip here). This is just as effective as the steroid. My only concern now is that the anti-fungal properties of Clotriminazole will lessen due to extended usage and I may have to start using steroids again.\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 14:19:00 From: Alex Subject: glycine/glycerine\nIf you are allergic to *glycine*, there's not anything you can do about it, since it is one of the amino acids that your body uses to make proteins. Even if you don't eat it, your body will make it from something else. So, I think your doctor is right about this one. If you were somehow allergic to glycine, eczema would be the least of your problems, since glycine is in virtually every protein in your body.\nGlycerine is a different thing, though.\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 12:40:05 From: Michael Subject: base for steroid cream\nI used to use a hydrocorozone cream that was in a cold cream type base. I could never seem clear my eczema 100%. Eventually every time I put the cream on my eczema would burn. I figure that I am allergic to some sort of petroleum derivitive in the cream. So I went to my pharmacist and a doctor. The doctor just wanted to put me on stronger steroids. The pharmacist suggested switching to a hydrocorozone mix with a Cetaphil base. I went with the pharmacists suggestion and within a week I have almost entirely cleared up my eczema. Cetaphil is an apparently very hypoallergenic solution.\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 16:18:38 From: John Subject: Colloids - egyptian cotton sheets\nA good example of a colloid is MILK!\nBTW, does anyone know where I can buy egyptian cotton sheets? I have tried a few of the large dept stores. No one seems to have them or even know what they are. One store told me that they have \"sheets with all kinds of designs\"... !\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 21:55:42 From: Faith Subject: colloids - egyptian cotton sheets\nTry Lands End (their Coming Home catalog). They carry many Egyptian cotton things, and I think sheets are on that list. Their prices are probably not what you'd find at the local Wal-mart, but they're not outrageous, either. And the sheets are almost always over-sized and really nice.\nThey also carry natural (unbleached, undyed) cotton sheets & blankets, even a cotton-stuffed pillow (no down).\nYou can contact them at http://www.landsend.com/ or by phone at (800)963-4816 (international: (608)935-6170).\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 22:04:00 From: Faith Subject: miracle \"cure\"? :)\nAm I the only one that notices her eczema tends to calm down considerably immediately after the dermatologist appointment has been made? Twice this has happened to me -- and this'll be my second dermatology appointment!\nIncidentally, I'm intending to confront him with my need/desire to find a permanent solution to this -- I want him (or someone he could refer me to) to help me track down the triggering allergen(s). I don't want to always be trying to control this and never hunting for why it happens in the first place. I want the root cause! If it can't be found, then I'll settle for controlling measures, but I want to at least try for prevention first...\nImpatient, aren't I? Frankly, one chronic, poorly-understood medical condition is plenty; I didn't need the eczema on top of the repetitive strain injury problems I already have. I've done enough doctor hopping with the RSI -- time to make a stand against the eczema. If I go down in flames, so be it -- at least I will have tried!\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 22:10:17 From: Kim Subject: miracle \"cure\"? :)\nFaith, I couldn't agree with you more, I am of the same mind. Lets find out what is causing the outbreaks and go from there. Our Derm. (for my son who is two) said childhood is the problem. Not foods, not diet, not animals big or small. O.K. I sent him packing but I think a lot of Drs feel this way.\nNow how do you control all the variables so you can find causes?\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 22:12:14 From: Kim Subject: Healing Psoriasis: The Natural Alternative\nI am thinking of purchasing the book. Has anyone used it and would they want to comment on the relation to eczema especially for a toddler?\nDate: 11 Feb 1997 22:10:34 From: Ann Subject: Polypropylene glycol\nRoyce, I stand corrected. After sending my posting about ointments vs. creams, I got that uncertain feeling and went to check my Elocon tube. Sure enough, polypropylene glycol is in there! Well, in the good old days, ointments DID have fewer ingredients than creams. I still prefer ointments because for me, greasy is better. The important thing is to read ALL labels. Hope I didn't mislead anyone.\nDate: 12 Feb 1997 09:20:58 From: Jolie Subject: Childhood Eczema\nLook into a book called \"Is this your child\" by Dr. Doris Rapp. It is a great guide to figure out your child allergies without the aid of high technology expensive dr. visits. Easily done at home with food elimination diets. Four days off, fifth day, eat a lot of the suspected food. Shows up every time.\nDate: 12 Feb 1997 09:33:44 From: Jolie Subject: Healing Psoriasis: The Natural Alternative\nThis book talks about the misalignment of the spine causing psoriasis and eczema problems. Debbi and I have used this concept on our babies. Debbi went one step further than I by using a chiropractor. I am very excited about her development and will look into it for my son.\nDate: 12 Feb 1997 09:44:23 From: Royce Subject: polypropylene glycol\nOops... I meant to write GLYCERIN.\nIs anyone allergic to Glycerin? I tried a 100% pure glycerin soap and had a reaction.\nDate: 12 Feb 1997 08:54:10 From: Gary Subject: Longs Scalp Relief Medicine\nI don't know which of these might be marketed in the UK, but here are three similar formulations that were on the shelf together. Again, I found the first (Longs proprietary formula) to be astoundingly effective on my eczema, i.e., it's vanished since I started using the stuff. I haven't used the other formulas. The following ingredients I copied directly from the labels.\nLongs Clear Liquid SCALP RELIEF ANTI-ITCH MEDICINE. 1% hydrocortisone USP; Also contains: Menthol, Propylene Glycol, SD 40 Alcohol, and Water.\nScalp-Itch \"by the makers of Lanacane\", Combe Incorporated, White Plains, NY 10604. 1.0% hydrocortizone USP, SD alcohol 40.\nCortizone 10 Scalp Itch Formula. Thompson Pharmaceuticals. 1.0% Hydrocortizone, Benzyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Purified Water, SD Alcohol 40-2 (60% v/v).\nAs I said before, I can't see why this formula should work when tubes of cortisone ointments and creams don't, but it does. My skin, however, is very sensitive to various oils (can't tolerate mineral oil formulations such as Eucerin or creams with more than just a little petrolatum) and the omission of oils from these lotions may help explain their effectiveness in my case.\nDate: 12 Feb 1997 13:25:43 From: Gayle Subject: Egyptian cotton sheets\nEgyptian cotton refers to the fiber it is made from. Egyptian cotton has longer and thinner fibers allowing a higher thread count (threads per inch). The tighter weave makes it feel wonderfully silky. Some have 320 threads per inch. I don't know but wonder if this tight weave makes things tougher for the dust mites.\nI would not have believed this was true until I experienced it!\nPrevious to the Egyption cotton sheets, I had on some occasions changed sheets 3 times (all 100% cotton). Will the flannel be better for me to touch? I am sure many of you with eczema know the frustration of trying to sleep when everything you touch seems painful or makes you itch.\nI brushed my hand on the sheets in a department store and couldn't believe the silky smooth feel. They were 100% Eqyptian cotton. I checked the price and asked the clerk when they would be on sale. They were already on sale. Fortunately, I was self indulgent that day and bought them anyway (about $50 a sheet).\nNow any time I get into bed I enjoy the feel of those sheets. They seem to last longer than other sheets and still look great after a couple of years of frequent washing.\nI have found them at all department stores: Bloomingdales, Nordstroms, Macy's. I don't think so at Penny's or Sears. Most of the designer brands include Egyptian cotton. They come in dark colors and prints that hide stains from scratching and weeping.\nWe deserve the treat of something nice next to our skin. Treat yourself.\nDate: 12 Feb 1997 09:22:21 From: Nancy Subject: happy to be back\nI've been reading your posts for a couple of months and was surprised to see that there is a link between asthma, allergy, stomach problems and eczema. I have all of them although my eczema is limited to my hands. I can't imagine having it all over my body.\nI want to share with you information regarding a new moisturizing lotion I have been using. It is the best I've found and while it hasn't completely cleared my eczema, I think it is going to. The name on the bottle says therapeutic Atrac-tain with 5% urea. It is made by the Sween Corporation, N. Mankato, MN 56001. I don't think it is widely-used because there were only two bottles on the shelf and they look like they've been there for a while. I just decided to try it because it was one that I'd never tried and it didn't contain lanolin. The ingredients are: water, urea 5%, sorbitol, glyceryl stearate, lactic acid, isopropyl palmitate, octyl palmitate, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid, ceteareth-25, ceteareth-6, peg-40 jojoba oil, quaternium-15, menthylbenzethonium chloride and EDTA.\nJust a note to Heather: My niece go married two years ago. She was a beautiful bride and she had a beautiful wedding. However, she still worries that her wedding was ruined because her mother-in-law used coloring in the wedding cake batter and the inside of the cake was pink and blue instead of mauve and green like she wanted. How's that for a \"major\" problem?? :-)\nDate: 12 Feb 1997 21:07:11 From: Karen Subject: Childhood Eczema\nIt is a good book.. In fact, I tried the suggestions in it first. Unfortunately, for some reason it never occurred to me that my daughter could be allergic to soy, so I never eliminated that, which has turned out to be the major culprit in her case. Because of that, even though I eliminated other suspect foods, there never was any profound change in her eczema.\nDate: 13 Feb 1997 04:35:55 From: Brigit Subject: glycerin\nGlycerin is an irritant to many people. It used to be a popular ingredient of many skin-care products, but its popularity has significantly gone downhill since it was found to irritate so many.\nThe reason it's still used is that it's absolutely necessary to produce a certain type of emulsion; it's not just something that's added, it's something you need when you want to produce a so-called \"vanishing cream\". These days it's often replaced by one of its components, sorbitol (yes, the sweetener).\nA Web search should yield more information than I can give you off the top of my head.\nDate: 13 Feb 1997 15:30:57 From: Karen Subject: glycerin\nI have always suspected that glycerin may give the illusion of lubricating the skin while it is in fact drying it out. My chemistry isn't great, but if glycerin is one of those substances that draws water to itself (hydrophilic?) from the air, then it must also drag water out of any other surface it's in contact with, in this case the skin. That's how honey and sugar pastes work when they're used as antibiotic dressings - they draw water out of the bacteria and kill them, I'm told. I should have paid more attention to the class on osmosis! Either way, it dried my (very oily) skin and that's the last thing eczema-people need.\nDate: 13 Feb 1997 09:32:54 From: Lynn Subject: Hello\nSomeone posted names of some anti-dust spray products. I had been thinking of trying these, and wondered if anyone has already used them and with what results? Can one be equally allergic to their ingredients as to dust? Also, can they be sprayed on clothes as well? Mine pick up a lot of dust in the closet, but I would wonder about having the spray so close to my body.\nHas anyone had any experience with natural ways of increasing adrenal support (for those of us who have ruined our adrenal systems with too much prednisone)? One health practitioner recommended bovine glandular supplements, but I've heard these are controversial (and possibly connected to mad cow disease). II know there are other things one could do, involving minerals and vitamins. I am already on an extensive vitamin/mineral program, but wondered if anyone had strong feelings about or experience with the glandulars.\nDate: 13 Feb 1997 11:23:24 From: Debbie Subject: Healing Psoriasis: The Natural Alternative\nI've read it! He's the author that speaks about Leaky Gut... and says along with it there seems to be a little trouble with elimination (recommends enemas or high colonics on a fairly regular basis) and talks about specific spinal misalignments (different ones for psoriasis vs. eczema) and specific recommendations for diet and supplements and topical agents.\nI like the book a lot. And like I've explained, I've been doing the chiropractor work, and dietary changes... but no enemas yet! Not on a baby (my opinion). I just give her a little bit of prunes every day. Now she's having one or two (better) bowel movements a day instead of one every two days. This is supposed to be better for them--to have food pass thru more quickly. The author does not speak at all about children or infants so I just use common sense, ask health food store prof. about supplemental/topical info, etc. If you don't already have a book like it then I think it's worth reading.\nDate: 13 Feb 1997 09:35:00 From: Gary Subject: glycerin\nThat's interesting, because glycerin is one of the few things my skin will tolerate. I use Curel Unscented almost exclusively because it's glycerin-based, with no mineral oil. In fact, I usually add a bit more glycerin to it.\nDate: 13 Feb 1997 13:40:34 From: Shelley Subject: gamma interferon research study\nI finally got hold of one of the doctors involved in the gamma interferon study at UCSF. They haven't started yet because they haven't gotten approval from the UCSF review board, but they anticipate starting within the next few weeks. Here's some of the basic information you need to know:\nThey will teach you how to give yourself a daily injection of gamma interferon, which they said is a synthetic version of what is normally produced by the body. You have to give yourself the injection every day for 3 months. You have to come to the office to be checked 6 times (baseline test, then week 1, week 4, week 8, week 12, and week 16 as follow-up). They will pay $140 for participation. He said they didn't think it would get rid of eczema permanently but would keep it under control (like insulin for diabetes). I spoke to Dr. Siebenlist at 415-476-4701 in San Francisco.\nObviously you have to be in the Bay Area to even consider doing this, but he said there are other places doing the study. I will have to ask him where else so that others could check on the possibility of doing this closer to home.\nCriteria for inclusion in the study: Must have eczema for longer than one year, must have family history of related problems, must have 20% of the body involved or 10% of face, feet, or genitalia, must have normal kidney, liver, and blood levels (which they will test), if taking antibiotics must be only taking one type, if on allergy shots must have been taking them for at least 6 months already, must have no heart disease, no diabetes, no vascular or rheumatology problems, no HIV, no cancer, no active infections, not pregnant nor lactating, no central nervous system problems, and never used interferon before.\nSo that's the basic information. Very interesting. I don't know if I will do it because I'm nervous about giving myself injections, but I'll think about it.\nDate: 14 Feb 1997 10:04:36 From: Royce Subject: - egyptian cotton sheets\nFlannel sheets seem softer to the touch but they still make me a little itchy. I've been sleeping with a soft, white cotton tee-shirt over my pillow case because it's the only thing that doesn't make me itch! These sheets sound like they're worth a try. Maybe I will treat myself.\nDate: 14 Feb 1997 11:18:19 From: Jolie Subject: Julia saw Pedi GI--finally!\nDebbie, I am sorry this GI was a disaster or so sounds like it. The formula he is recommending is the most expensive stuff on the market. The blood test in my opinion means nothing, even my GI never performed these tests on Mac. I do agree with the idea of changing your diet. It does directly affect the baby.\nSounds like they do not like the competition of a chiropractor. So who are they to make these types of judgements of other professionals?\nI called my homeopathic MD for a referral for a chiropractor, unfortunately he is unavailable until Monday. Mac has not been well lately, he had a fever siezure on Sunday. This was new to me, I called the ambulance and had him rushed in. He is better now but still not right. He is crancy, flaring up, generally unhappy. He is not sleeping well even with the periactin. They plugged him full of medications, antibiotics, drugs, drugs, drugs. I did complain but they looked at me like I was crazy. That was when I threw the towel in and took him to my homeopathic MD. He said take him off everything. He will get better on his own. Best advice yet!\nThe homeopathic MD suggested vitamin therapy for Mac, first and foremost the colloidal minerals. These he has been receiving. He also suggested a vitamin high in leafy green vitamins. The first suggested vitamins he will not chew. I am now looking for a liquid form of the same type which can be mixed in his food. Any suggestions?\nDate: 14 Feb 1997 11:18:19 From: Debbie Subject: Julia saw Pedi GI--finally!\nI'm sorry to hear about Mac's illness. Scary stuff. Did I tell you that I also broke down when Julia was sick with croup 2 weeks ago, and took her to a derm. for the first time? Thought I'd try it. But it was as expected: topical prescription cortisone, Bactroban (antiobiotic ointment), and a prescription antihitamine (Atarax). They seem to make no real difference in the sense that if she's itchy she still wakes up to scratch regardless of being drugged around the clock (which I did for a week). So, I stopped it, and will do it at just bedtime for a bit longer---just in case it's helping at all.\nJulia's clearing again right now. So, she had 9 clearing days (with only 2 actual days of \"looking\" clear since she started out as mess), then went downhill for 3 days (but not too bad at all really) and now has been going back uphill for the last 3 days. Since she was no where near raw/bleeding/oozing this time she's practically clear after only 2 days of no real itching.\nYou know, I am really wondering if it's not (also) due to the homeopathic remedy. This is the exact time period she described it would take. And it has been pretty gradual since Christmas... But I've been doing everything else since then too (diet, colloidal minerals, chiro.). But even the chiro. didn't seem to know why she was worse again on Mon. (while she was also starting to flare again too)... All I know is I am thrilled... something is working! Even the rest of her skin is becoming \"baby soft\" everywhere! Gotta go, off to the chiro.\nIf you don't already have a liquid form of colloidal trace minerals the one I get is by \"Innovative Natural Products\", brown bottle, 1 oz., 4 oz., and something like 7 oz., called Colloidal Multiple Minerals. I'm not doing a green leafy thing so I don't know anything about it.\nDate: 14 Feb 1997 11:51:05 From: Mella Subject: Eczema & wedding dress: need support!\nMy pet peeve is people who act as if the rash is my fault somehow, as if I rolled in poison ivy or something. My second pet peeve is people who with all the authority in the world announce that it is stress-related. They say this as if it is the same as being all in my head, and therefore still my fault. It would be enlightening for them if they could walk a mile in my shoes sometimes.\nDate: 14 Feb 1997 10:18:34 From: Kim Subject: Debbie and Mac's Mom???\nWe are going to see a chiro on Monday on next week, while he did not think spin manip was the way to go he had a plan called B.E.S.T. that we are going to try. He read me the riot act about all the antibiotics from last year, but what is a mom to do you work with what you have till you find something better. Sorry to hear Mac got so sick, I know how scary that is last winter. Fever up to 104 about every two weeks for three months, they I didn't sleep because of worry now I don't sleep because of the itch factor. Truth be known I would rather it is the itch, my son is now at the point he can say \"I itch\" I like having the communication even if it is 2:00 a.m.\nDate: 14 Feb 1997 12:58:04 From: Bob Subject: Red wine\nI have the same reaction as Diane... Red wine is a problem, white wine much less, and any alchoholic beverage has some irritation.\nDate: 15 Feb 1997 16:43:12 From: Gretchen Subject: glycerine, etc.\nMy skin also tolerates glycerin much better than it does mineral oil. Because of this, the zinc oxide ointments (with a mineral oil base) bother me. I've called everywhere in town looking for Sudocrem, which was a zinc oxide preparation mentioned in the Eczema FAQ sheet, but to no avail. Does anyone know who manufactures Sudocrem? No pharmacy in town could tell me.\nDate: 16 Feb 1997 06:00:23 From: David Subject: Sudocrem\nThe jar of Sudocrem I have says:\nSudocrem ANTISEPTIC HEALING CREAM Napkin rash, Bed Sores, Eczema, Acne, Surface wounds, Sunburn, Chilblains, Minor Burns\nZinc Ox EurP 15.25% Benzyl Alc BP 0.39% Benzyl Benz BP 2.02% Benzyl Cinnam 0.15% Lanolin (Hypo-allergenic) 4.00%\nMade in Ireland for:\nTosara Products (UK) Ltd PO Box 5 70 Picton Road Liverpool L15 4NS\nSudocrem is on the shelves of most pharmacies in the UK and is also available in supermarkets and cut price \"drug stores\". It is usually found with the babycare products as it is used for napkin/nappy/diaper rash.\nDate: 17 Feb 1997 07:33:27 From: Brigit Subject: Triludan\nFYI, I read in the paper that the FDA has announced its intent to ban terfenadine, which is the active ingredient of Triludan (anti-histamine). It seems that in combination with certain other medications, which were not specified in the article, terfenadine can lead to heart rhythm problems.\nI for one will not be taking any more Triludan.\nDate: 17 Feb 1997 12:56:17 From: David Subject: Triludan\nMy understanding is that Triludan on its own is safe. I understand the problem occurs in combination with certain antibiotics - including erythromycin - interesting since a lot of us have probably had the case of antibiotics and Triludan!\nDate: 17 Feb 1997 18:31:52 From: Anil Subject: Adrenal system/ (was:hello)\nLynn, Craniosacral therapy () can help in restoring all the hormonal functions. I've just completed a course in it, and my skin is looking a hell of a lot better. If anything, the itch is worse, but I think that's a healing response (I really hope so) as the lesions are healing up, the dry patches and my total body eczema (mild) are practically gone. I'm back to eczema on my legs only.\nThe theory is that your body knows how to heal itself, and practitioners just provide that little boost of energy to kick start the process. It GENTLY repositions any dysfunctions in your body, and re-aligns the cranial bones to their correct position. This frees up trapped nerves, blood vessels etc, throughout the body and allows the organs to work properly. It's like osteopathy without the force. You feel light touch only. But it has powerful results, including a decrease in tension/stress.\nAs you can see, I'm sold on the idea! I'd recommend it to anyone.\nDate: 18 Feb 1997 10:43:00 From: Debbie Subject: to: Debbie and Julia\nWe are still going to the chiro., although he just cut her down to once a week (after 3 wks. of going twice a week). There are a ton of chiros everywhere, as opposed to the amount of pedi GI's, for example. Although the quality of some might be better than others, I think they are probably all going to be of the same general philosophy. It's just what chiropractic med. is all about. And it is still considered alternative by alot of conventional med... Our insurance does not cover it. It was $45 for the first visit and $35 for the rest.\nBy the way, I didn't consider the Pedi GI visit a disaster at all. I'm all for the specific tests he's running... and I didn't expect much more since we already got Julia under control once ourselves. I was hoping for tests, actually. And specific nutritional info. I don't know he could tell it's leaky gut or not without specimens. How did your Dr. diagnose it, by the way? If she takes to the formula (which I doubt) they'll give us a prescription for it which will just involve a $5 co-payment for us. We go back in 3 weeks.\nJulia just had her birthday party this weekend and was clear for it!!! That night though she started another mild bout--itchy, a little pinkish red----but nothing like she was. I'm seriously wondering about an allergy to dogs/cats. We don't have any. But everyone we know does. I used to visit my sister's house practically daily. Since everyone had one and I was always going somewhere I was never able to connect it. She just had chronic breakouts--every single day, worsenig as time went on.\nNow the only breakouts she's had this month have been after being around them: two bad ones after actually patting two different dogs on 2 different occassions, and then two mild ones after being in a dog family's house and then after dog owners came to our house and held her for a while, etc. (her party). I've been avoiding visiting anyone with a dog for 3 weeks now and these are the 3 weeks she's been clear. Now it doesn't take a rocket scientist to at least suspect it. However, this is the same month that we've done a lot of other things differently too.\nI started flax seed oil yesterday. That stuff sounds great--I should probably be taking it too! Hope Mac's illness is improving...\nDate: 18 Feb 1997 12:08:23 From: Susan Subject: a newcomer\nWe think that Isaac's eczema is related to allergies, but we have not been able to pin down exactly what he's sensitive to. He's had RAST tests that identified peas, peanuts, and dairy as allergens, but we know that he has at least superficial (skin irritation) sensitivities to eggs, peaches, tomatoes, and especially mold.\nWe also think that his eczema got triggered by a series of antibiotics that he was on to fight ear infections that began at about 5 months. Our doctors just put him on one anti-biotic after another, and we went along with it, not knowing we should be concerned, for a few months. Then we began an ongoing \"fight\" with the medical community that we continue to fight. At first we didn't have much ammunition--we just tried to talk them out of prescribing antibiotics--but eventually we started seeing specialists, and got better information...\nSo, about a year ago, we did a while lot of things, which have definitely improved Isaac's skin from being very itchy, red, and cracking over a large percentage of his body, to today's cycle of flares and clear-ups on his legs and arms:\nstopped all antibiotics. He still gets ear infections, but our ENT lets him fight the infections without drugs. We still might have to do ear tubes at some point, but his ears are NO WORSE than they were when he was on the antibiotics.\nwash all his bedding in superhot water once a week, including his stuffed animals, pillow, and bumpers.\nwash all his clothes in hot water (with All-clear, which seems to work for him), and double-rinse them.\nput him on a four-day rotation diet (only gets a particular food once every four days) from age 14 mos. to about 18 mos; now it's a two-day rotation).\neliminated all known allergens, and also several that the dermatologist suggested we stay away from \"just in case\". We started eliminating lots: dairy, wheat, eggs, tomatoes, corn, chocolate, citrus, peanuts. Then we slowly added them back in, except for dairy, eggs, peanuts, and corn, which he has an obvious reaction to.\nsaw a chiropractor. Not sure if this helped or not. We saw two different ones, and stopped after he became VERY scared of the second one (her adjustments hurt him). We might start this up again, and have a referral to someone with a good reputation.\nsee a homeopath. We don't know whether this has helped or not. The guy has a great reputation, and Isaac's skin has definitely improved while in his care, but we've also done all these other things at the same time.\nstarted supplements. At the recommendation of a naturopath, he was taking all kinds of weird things, most of which we have now stopped. The one thing that we think really worked was the evening primrose oil. We started out with small doses (1/2 tsp. per day), with no results. Then a doctor who knows about alternative medicine (but has since closed up shop) told us to greatly increase the dosage, to 2 tablespoons per day. We usually gave him 4-5 tsp/ per day, and think that this really helped him. However, we recently heard from a nutritionist that large does of gammalinoleic acid can actually hinder brain functioning, which scared us so much that we stopped it altogether. And his skin went downhill, slowly, after about amonth. So we've just started up again, with 1 tsp/day, and looking for ANYONE who might know what a safe dose of this is. I have pored over medical journals, written to researchers, and still can't find anyone who will say what/if the negative side effects of evening primrose oil are.\nfooted sleepers. Because his legs are his worse area, I have sewn socks into all of his jumpsuits and pants. This makes it much harder for him to get at his legs, and definitely helps him not scratch. It doesn't seem to drive him to his hands, either for some reason. It's a pain to change his diapers, though--have to take his shoes off each time.\ncool clothing. We dress him TWO full layers lighter than we are dressed. This was suggested by our doctor, and is hard for me to do because I grew up being constantly cold (for economic reasons) and have a big emotional reaction to cold. However, he is not at all bothered by it--he prefers it. So I have to get over my own stuff and dress him lightly.\n\"training.\" This sounds weird, but I began very early to help him figure out how to stop himself from scratching. When he was about 10 mos, he understood the concept of \"stop.\" So we began a game where we would (both) scratch our legs for a second, then throw our hands in the air and yell \"STOP!\" For a while, say at age 11 or 12 mos, this actually worked to help him stop. We'd play the game, and he'd stop. Now that doesn't work as well, but he's a pretty good talker now, so we have new options.\n\"counseling.\" Our theory is that his eczema/scratching is in part his way of dealing with emotional challenges, and that he scratches because it distracts him from the confusion/fear/pain he's feeling about something in his life. So when we have the attention for it, we have sessions where we lovingly, but physically, restrain him from scratching. He yells, cries, kicks, and struggles, but we calmly hold him, encourage him to keep going in his crying and kicking, and assure him that he's doing the right thing, we love him, and we'll help him through this. Getting his eye contact during this is tough, but important. These sessions seem to really help him. He finally slows down, seems to look at us more openly, asks to get down, and goes to play--without scratching. These can last from two minutes (any diaper change is an opportunity for a session) to an hour or more, depending mostly on our attention, not his.\nhome daycare. We had to pull him out of a group daycare setting because his skin got so bad there. We have a person come to our home three days a week. This is expensive, but it's helped him, and we hope that eventually he'll be able to tolerate other environments more easily.\nDate: 18 Feb 1997 14:51:43 From: Karen Subject: a newcomer\nWas your son tested for soy? And is he, by chance on any soy formulas since he's allergic to milk?\nI ask because my almost-3-year-old recently underwent allergy testing and was allergic to many of the things you mentioned, including milk and soy. Not knowing she was allergic to soy, we had been giving her soy toddler formula. Stopping the formula and following the allergist's protocol, her skin is the clearest it has ever been. There are still mild patchy outbreaks from time to time, but it's not nearly as bad as it was.\nDate: 18 Feb 1997 17:32:03 From: Unknown Subject: a newcomer\nMy daughter is also allergic to tomatoes she reacts with redness, itching and hives around her mouth. In spite of keeping her off of her allergic foods (tomatoes, chocolate,peaches) her eczema never cleared up. When allergy testing showed a MILD reaction to potatoes, we took her off of that favourite food and her skin cleared up considerably. Tomatoes, potatoes and peppers are in the deadly nightshade family. Often there are cross-allergies between these foods.\nRegarding Evening Primrose Oil: I took it for 3 yrs for Fibromyalgia and severe PMS. It worked beautifully but I had to discontinue it because it aggravated my irritable bowel syndrome. That is the only side effect that I have heard of, I believe it is generally quite safe.\nDate: 18 Feb 1997 15:31:02 From: David Subject: Triludan (terfenadine)\nAccording to my \"Bumper Book of Drugs for Hypochondriacs\" or whatever it is called, adverse effects from terfenadine are rare. Occasionally indigestion may occur. Headaches, drowsiness and dizziness are rarer, as are palpitations and fainting.\nAs for interactions with other drugs, antifungal drugs (including Ketoconazole and Itraconazole) and the antibiotic Erthromycin increase terfenadine levels and may affect the heart.\nTerfenadine may increase the sedative effect of antidepressants, sleeping pills and antipsychotics, whilst antidepressants increase the chance of abnormal heart rhythms.\nThe anticholinergic effects of terfandine may be increased by drgus which have anticholinergic effects. This includes antipsychotics and antidepressants.\n(Anticholinergic drigs are used to affect muscle movements and are used to treat urinary incontinence and IBS.)\nIf you want to read all about it see:\nThe British Medical Association New Guide to Medicines and Drugs. Dorling Kindersley Limited, 1994 472 pages\nDate: 18 Feb 1997 20:00:14 From: Debbie Subject: Welcome Sue (& Isaac)\nHi Sue, I am doing the exact things you are! Julia's face has always been the worst. During 7 mos. to 11 mos. she was raw, red, oozing, bleeding on her face and it started spreading more to neck, wrists, legs, and elbows. Right now (and for last 3 weeks) she's doing great: clearing completely on some days. Even her bad days now are what good days used to be. Before this, she never had a clear day.\nI'm a little confused what to blame the clearing on. She's been going to a hom eopath for 5 months. First remedy wasn't the one but she's doing much better since we started the second one (mid Dec.). But I also started a diet change then. I removed almost everything from her diet except rice, pears, apples, sweet potatoes, squash. We've also been doing the chiropractor for 3 weeks now (twice a week) with great success. These are the same 3 weeks she's been clear. I've just started her on flax seed oil, which is kind of similar to evening primrose oil. I've also been giving her colloidal trace minerals.\nAs for the other routine stuff, I also use Tide Free, double rinse... hot water bedding... no antibiotics (she either had a bad reaction to Keflex at 7 mos. or coincidentally got a virus then). I wasn't putting on any steroid ointment in those bad months because it wasn't changing anything so I didn't want the drugs. However, I use them occasionally now that she goes a week at a time with no new breakouts, etc. I've been giving her an antihistimine once at bedtime lately too. Although I'm not going to continue this much longer. I started it to help her sleep better while sick with Croup a few weeks ago. If she's itchy, she still wakes up anyway though.\nRegarding the chiro: Did your chiropractor describe Isaac's condition to you in a visit-by-visit basis? Was Isaac real bad when he first came in, etc.? Because my chiro. had a lot to say about Julia. Said she was really, really tight in the shoulder blade area, also has said she is making incredible progress--except for one session where he said she went downhill a bit. And sure enough we had just had a horrible night's sleep, which was the beginning of a bad 3-day cycle. The condition of her spine always coincides with the state of her eczema. I don't know if this is just coincidence or what... I'm most inclined to think that it's a case where everything is working together towards the same end cure. The remedy, the diet, the chiropr., etc. We are sleeping now though and she looks great so whatever the reason, I'm thrilled!\nTell me about the homeopath you go to. Do you feel it's successful? Julia's on Bufo (toad poison), a minor one, not many people have heard of it. The first one she was on was Phosphorous. My homeopath feels absolutely certain that we'll get it right and that the eczema will be gone (along with future allergies, asthma... ). Did yours feel that confident about it. After just spending 3 months with an unsuccessful one, though, I wasn't feeling as confident as she was.\nHave you been researching \"Leaky Gut?\" Your info. and solutions are just so similar to many of ours on this list. What have your doctors attributed all the allergies to? Any mention? Any theories of your own?\nDate: 18 Feb 1997 19:25:39 From: Patsy Subject: Psorelief\nA friend called to tell me she'd caught the last few seconds of an MD on television talking about Psorelief. She said the doc was saying it was something new & effective for psorasis and eczema. I was wondering if anyone on the list is familiar with this? If so, what can they share?\nDate: 18 Feb 1997 19:57:31 From: Tina Subject: Hello again\nI am finding all this very interesting because all these children sound just like my son Daniel. He is 16 months old and has been itchy since just a couple of weeks old. I nursed him for just over 5 months and our doctors all said he probably didn't have food allergies. Just bad cradle cap etc... My husband grew up with fairly bad eczema and is still itchy... The doctors finally said Daniel had eczema when he was a few months old and in the last few months we have been seeing an allergist.\nDaniel is highly allergic to peanuts, filberts, cashews and eggs. A little allergic to citrus, beef, chicken, wheat and a few other things. Oddly enough he has no problem with milk and that is usually a big one. When we first took him to the allergist his skin was so bad they couldn't test him there. They had to send blood to a special clinic. He then tested positive to potatoes and soy, but his last test came up negative.\nSince removing some of these foods from his diet his skin has improved but not totally. His face and hands are still red and swollen and he gets blotches on the rest of his body that come and go daily.\nThe other day my husband was in restaurant with Daniel and a man gave him his card and recommended trying enzymes. He said his wife and children were itchy from head to toe and they are totally clear now. Has anyone heard of this or tried it?\nWe use antihistimines at night. Before we did that Daniel was awake every 20 minutes to an hour scratching and crying. Now he wakes up about once a night for a water bottle. I saw on TV that some antihistimines can slow a child down over time, has anyone researched that yet?\nWe use topical steroid creams when he gets real bad only about once or twice every couple of weeks but they scare me.\nDate: 18 Feb 1997 23:53:12 From: Christopher Subject: Hello again\nHis allergies sound exactly like mine, and I'm 15. I still have problems with all of those things, though especially to eggs, and any nuts. My skin is almost completely clear now, thanks to a good vitamin regimen, and a little change in diet. If I will do what I must to my diet, I believe I can rid myself of the problems that I even have now.\nActually, the summer was normally the worst for me, because I was outside the most. I would recommend that you bathe him very often in warm water (hot water will irritate the skin usually, and cold is unbearable) during the summer, as the dirt irritates the skin, causing itching. I would also recommend that when you clean him, clean him thoroughly. Simply because, from my experience, only light cleansing is more irritative than none whatsoever. A thorough cleansing should help the itching quite a bit.\nI've used topical steroid creams regularly since a baby, and I use them fairly regularly now (my eczema is not as bad). Though I am sure it is different for different people; I suppose I am very lucky.\nI believe diet is a major factor, as well as regular bathing. I believe (though I may be wrong) that regular bathing would remove some of the bacteria that causes the itching. Also, a vitamin regimen would help sufficiently. I have noticed that a good vitamin regimen has almost eliminated the itching (it got to the point at one time that I wished I had a wire brush to scratch with), as well as induced healing. It has been extremely helpful on my scalp eczema. I might also suggest that \"sun bathing\" be used as well. I have found this to be very helpful in my case. The summers that I went swimming very regularly were the ones that I had the least problems, if I could tolerate the clorine. Though be careful and to not let the skin burn. That is no good. It can do nothing but make the skin worse.\nI would suggest that you find a good allergist, and experiment with many of the therapies that have been mentioned in this group. The \"evaporation\" therapy that was mentioned by someone in the group has been something that I used in the past, though I never knew anyone else used it. It was a method that I stopped using (for some strange reason) a few years ago, and that is why I could not recall anything about it, until my mother told me that I did that at one time. It is quite helpful. There are so many things you can try. Though, if you are lucky, the condition should clear up as he gets older. Be careful that he does not scratch any particular places on his body regularly though. I have some really glaring scars on my body from when I was much younger from where I scratched a particular area constantly. If you can clear up the itching problem, 90% of the condition is solved.\nDate: 19 Feb 1997 08:55:04 From: Brigit Subject: Triludan (terfenadine)\nDavid, whatever your book from 1994 says, the FDA is about to BAN the stuff!!\nNew research has shown it's not as safe as was previously thought. For this reason, it's recalled from the market.\nDate: 19 Feb 1997 14:58:13 From: David Subject: Triludan (terfenadine)\nMy understanding, from talking to my pharmacist is that it is purely an interaction problem. The killer is that these things are available for sale widely and that you can't check people haven't got the other drugs it interacts with.\nDate: 18 Feb 1997 19:37:33 From: Shanon Subject: a newcomer -Reply\nHi Susan, I am also new to the list and felt very moved by your post. I personally suffered very much with my skin problems as a child (my brother had it too but not as bad). When I was a teen, I cleared up and had no problems until about four years ago. Now, I am the worst I have ever and can barely stand to be in my own skin.\nI have a three year old that we were afraid would get it but no problems so far (she had several ear infections until she was two but now can blow her nose and has never has another). I am not sure if you can do this with a toddler but Vitamin C gives me a lot of relief. I takes the burn out of my skin and also seems to promote the healing. I tried Primrose Oil along time ago and don't remember that it helped much but since your post, I think I will try it again.\nDate: 19 Feb 1997 10:35:50 From: Linda Subject: a newcomer\nMy son, Brian, is now 6-1/2 mos. old and has eczema on his face, scalp, and a few spots on his body. My dermatologist asked me to stop nursing last week asap ... so I haven't breastfed him since last Friday evening. And I started using Vitamin E cream on his face. Already his face is looking much better -- thank God! The derm told me to see how he is after one week off breastmilk, and if it's not better, he would need to have allergy tests done. So, you've already been down the path that we might need to walk. Could you tell me how they do the allergy testing on a baby -- just curious in case we need to do this.\nI also have eczema. When I was pregnant, my hormones went crazy (of course!), and so did my eczema. I was on prednisone during late pregnancy when I just couldn't stand it anymore. Since Brian's birth, my eczema has calmed down a lot. When I read through past archives, I could relate to those of you talking about scratching for hours in bed at night. There have been many times in the past when I couldn't stop scratching. It's easy for my husband to say \"stop scratching\", but he's not the one who is itchy!\nDate: 19 Feb 1997 11:46:28 From: Susan Subject: Welcome Sue (& Isaac)\nNo, Isaac didn't/doesn't get soy formula. Because his strongest allergy was to peas and peanuts, we just decided not to mess around with soy (and our allergist agreed). So he drinks rice milk (on his rice day, which is every other day now), fortified with calcium.\nWe are trying to distinguish between foods that Isaac's skin is sensitive to, and ones he's actually allergic to. Many, many foods make his face red and blotchy as he eats (he's not too neat). As I understand it, this isn't technically an \"allergy\"--that word is saved for reactions that involve his immune system. For example, tomatoes make his face red and itchy while he eats them, but don't seem to have a secondary reaction through his skin (ie, his eczema doesn't get worse after having eaten them). We used to get concerned these food \"sensitivities,\" but we've gotten so used to them that we don't get so concerned about them now. We still try to avoid those foods, though.\nIn the last couple of weeks, we have noticed a change in Isaac's skin--I've even wondered if he even has eczema anymore. His skin used to be red, patchy, raised, and when he'd scratch, it would get very angry red, raised, dry looking, and eventually bleed. In the last few weeks, his skin has been blotchy, but the blotches are not usually raised--they're splashes of color. Instead of that red, raised skin, he gets welts. Welts everywhere, all the time. He almost always has a few on his face these days--isolated little raised circles, whitish, that look like what a mosquito bite looks like in the first minute or two after you get it. These do not then get red and angry--they just disappear. And new ones show up somewhere else. When he scratches now, instead of that red and abraded skin, he gets BIG patches of welts--dozens of small, white bumps, amost contiguous to each other. They are raised by just one or two swipes of his scratching, and they last for about ten minutes, then go away.\nHas anyone else ever seen this change? It looks so much more \"allergic\" than it used to. And he's so SENSITIVE now... just getting excited during play will bring welts out on his face and legs. He's always been sensitive, emotionally, but this physical sensitivity is striking.\nDate: 19 Feb 1997 11:24:25 From: Patsy Subject: Welcome Sue (& Isaac)\nWhat you are describing on Isaac is hives - a condition I also have. If they are left alone (although they itch horribly) they will fade and disappear within 30 minutes or so. They tend to pop out on me when I get excited.\nDate: 19 Feb 1997 12:31:46 From: Shelley Subject: a newcomer\nSue: You are a wonderful mother to be doing so much to help your son! I am greatly impressed with your efforts, especially what you call \"training\" and \"counseling\". If my mother had had the intelligence to handle the emotional aspects I think I would have made major improvement. Keep up the good work!\nDate: 19 Feb 1997 11:01:31 From: Ann Subject: hives\nSusan, What you describe on your son's skin sounds like hives to me also. Please mention it soon to a doctor. Most of my hive attacks have been of no consequence. But occasionally I've had throat swelling and have needed medical help. Generally, I prefer to deal with hives rather than eczema (because hives go away on their own), but the hives are more medically significant.\nDate: 19 Feb 1997 13:03:21 From: Tina Subject: hello again\nThank you Chris, for writing to me. It is so amazing how many people have the same problems as our household. And you have been dealing with them as a teen. Ugh! I have already sent away for mailings on how Daniel can cope with all this growing up. What do you find is the hardest to deal with, such as itchiness or blotchiness or food allergies... not being able to eat what other people eat? My husband has a better understsanding on the inability to stop scratching than I do since he grew up with eczema, but not on his face, it was mostly wrists and arms.\nI pretty much like our allergist. He seems to know what he's talking about, I think he's scared of overwhelming us though with too much information.\nHas anyone out there heard about using enzymes?\nHas anyone else heard about antihistamines causing long term problems?\nDate: 19 Feb 1997 18:06:24 From: Rita Subject: Child ECZEMA\nReading the recent postings on the possible causes of eczema, I have been thinking about the cause of my 11 months' . So far, we haven't been able to pinpoint what causes it. There are just all these theories.\nI used to think her problem is leaky gut but am not so sure anymore. The only thing Jodi has benefited from is Chinese Herbal Treatment. Her diagnosis is toxins in the blood. When I asked the Chinese dr where the toxins came from, he said it was from me when I was pregnant with her. True there was a history of atopy. My father had asthma as a child. Several of my siblings suffer from rhinitis. Another is highly allergy to certain food. I had eczema as a child but quickly and luckily outgrew it very early on. Could Jodi's eczema be due to bad genes?\nJodi was born a full term baby at 8 lbs 2oz. Delivery was very very smooth, less than 10 minutes. Could the pressure from the birth canal have caused damage to her craniosacral system? I doubt it. I had acceptable weight gain of 33 lbs during that pregnancy. Felt great all through pregnancy, needed no medication or had no complications at all. Jodi has had no blows to her head or trauma to her spine; couldn't think of anything that could cause any neurotoxin or any malnutrition. She was breast fed till 7 months. Never had any thrush or any sign of candida, no ear infection or use of antibiotic . Never used antihistamine either, only used steroid for a short period. Her formula is Alimentum which has no milk protein or milk sugar or soy. Her solid food only include pear, apple, rice, carrot, yam, very lean pork, Chinese leafy green and rice cereal. She has bowel movements 2-4 times a day, with her poo looking either soft-sausage-like or custard-like. She has no diaper rash from her poo which may suggest undigested food and she has very good appetite. I also cook her food from scratch. Still, something is missing and I don't know what.\nWell, the benefit from the Chinese herbal treatment seems to give way to a series of countered epidsodes . Jodi has not had much luck since her return from her Chinese Herbal treatment in China. The Aveeno oatmeal bath caused full body contact dermatitis. Then a viral attack caused huge blisters over her lips and eczematic right cheek. 2 more major flare ups within the past 10 days, both happened when we were dining out in a restaurant which was overheated and crowded. We ended up leaving in the middle of the course but it was too late. Damage had been done. I wanted to kill myself for letting all that happen to her.\nI try to put these pieces together and still couldn't make sense of what I've noted. All I know is Jodi likes cool and well ventilated places like our home. When her body temperature rises, her skin acts up and rashes develop quickly, especially on her cheeks. I still cannot tell if the pruritus comes first or the rash comes first. They almost always happen together. She also tends to scratch more when she is not content i.e. like when she is sleepy but doesn't want to sleep; or if she can't get to where she wants to go. She's learning to walk holding onto things around her. But since she hates lying on her belly or being in the crawling position, there are times she can't find anything to support herself to move around. I notice that is when she'll start scratching, more like out of desperation and not because she needs to. Not like her sister, who cried out for help when she was in the same situation at the same age. Jodi doesn't call for our help, she simply starts scratching. I sometimes think that's her way of drawing our attention. Either my husband or I have to stay with her or else she'll start scratching. And now her sister wants the same attention. Being part of the care-taking doesn't seem to appeal to her anymore. I wish they could grow faster. I know things will get easier when Juliet has passed her terrible TWO and Jodi's immune system gets stronger.\nI'd better get my mind off her eczema. I can go on and on and on... thinking... there must be something I can do to help.\nDate: 19 Feb 1997 19:13:30 From: Shanon Subject: Child ECZEMA -Reply\nRita, Your post was heartbreaking... I was born with eczema, came home from the hospital with it. I suffered with it until I was about 15 years old. It gradually got better, then... I thought I was cured.\nAt 32 years old, my husband and I moved to a new house to start our new family. I now have eczema the worst I have ever been in my life. I am miserable in my own skin with it head to toe. When I am nervous or hot, it is much worse and if I sweat, I feel like I will die. My mother and I have gone back over my highs and lows with it and the relationship to the homes that we lived in. It all fits!!! I have been tested my times, the most thorough being a blood test. I had very few reactions to foods, just swordfish. Many plants, trees, dust and molds had catastrophic reactions.\nThe different houses that I have lived in have been the pattern. Even when I was a child, my parents built a new home and I completely cleared up. There is a company called \"National Allergy Supply, Inc.\" 1-800-522-1448 that markets a test that you can order for $25. In a nutshell, you collect dust from your home and send it to John Hopkins, they will analyze it and tell you what is in your home. I haven't tried this yet but am planning on it. I am researching the possibility of asbestos being the problem at the house I live in now. I am not sure that will show up on the test.\nMy mother always told me how heartbreaking it was for HER that I had eczema and not to itch it!... just tell your baby that you will find a way for her to be normal... I always just wanted to be normal.\nP.S. Vitamins help me a lot-- C and E\nDate: 19 Feb 1997 19:26:31 From: Patsy Subject: Good condition\nI've hesitated to say anything for fear it would put a jinx on this improvement, but I chance it to say my skin is in the best condition it's been in since I first encountered eczema. This group did it. By stopping itches as soon as possible with cold water followed by air drying, I've pretty much got it to a tolerable stage. I now double rinse clothing that touches the affected areas and omit fabric softener on them. I've added zinc to my vitamin regimin. I also keep my heat turned down in the house to the point that others complain, but heat and sweat drive me batty. Thanks, group!\nDate: 19 Feb 1997 16:49:24 From: Christopher Subject: My anti-eczema vitamin regimen (THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE!)\nI have been hesitant for some reason to post vitamin regimen. I suppose it is because so many people are probably allergic to many of these things... but here we go (These are all taken twice a day):\n1 Vita Smart Men's Multi-Vitamin\n1 capsule (400 I.U.) Vitamin E\n1 capsule (19 grains) of lecithin (I believe this is a soy derivitive --I am just experimenting with this one!)\n1 Calcium/Magnesium/Zinc tablet (333 mg/133 mg/5 mg)\n1 Potassium tablet (99 mg)\nCod Liver Oil (A & D Supplement) (1250 I.U./130 I.U.)\n1 Nature's Biotics caplet (500 mg)\nCan be obtained from: Life Science Products, Inc. St. George, Utah 84770.\nAlong with this, I treat the condition further with Schering's Elocon Ointment (0.1%) (a steroid cream; not regularly), and Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion: Sensitive Dry Skin w/ oatmeal.\nThis is my treatment for my eczema, and it helps a lot. I have noticed that since I have quit taking the Nature's Biotics caplet, my eczema has gotten worse, so I KNOW that that one is helpful. I also may note that the Lecithin may be causing more harm than good (I am experimenting with it). It may also be worth noting that the Cod Liver Oil (A & D), as well as the Vitamin E are essential.\nAgain, this is only my way of treating the problem, and it differs from person to person; depending on allergies, etc. Much of this regimen is not simply to help the eczema, but to help my health in general (I don't eat what I should).\nDate: 20 Feb 1997 11:32:45 From: Susan Subject: Child ECZEMA\nI took Isaac to the pediatrician yesterday because he'd developed new spots on his chest--a new kind of spot he hasn't had before--not even hive-ish. Turns out he probably has a viral infection (white blood cell count is up), which could be accounting for why he has so many hives lately. The great news was that he weighed 20 lbs, 15 oz--a gain of a whole pound. We have been struggling with his weight for so long--he limps along on his little 1st percentile growth curve. Then last month he fell off even that curve, and our doctors were concerned that we have more than eczema to worry about. Which still might be true, actually, but it was such a great thing to have him break the 20-pound barrier. (Jeez, he's almost two, and technically, he should still be in the infant car seat!)\nLinda--I had a question about the breast-feeding advice from your dermatologist. I spent the first year of my life as a very sick kid, and it took the doctors a year to figure out that I was very allergic to dairy--so allergic, that I was reacting to the dairy coming trhough my mom's breastmilk. I think that the same thing happened to Isaac--I was drinking lots of milk, and eating lots of peanut butter, when I was breastfeeding him, and I was making him sick. So I stopped breastfeeding about about five months, but the allergies were all rolling by then. And, unfortunately, once I wasn't breastfeeding him anymore, he got in this never-ending cycle of ear infections. Now I'm not sure that he wouldn't have had the ear infections anyway, just because of the allergies, but in retrospect, I think I should have forced myself to stop the diary and peanuts in my diet, and kept breastfeeding him. Even knowing what I know now, though, I might not have done it, then--breastfeeding was terribly painful for me, I was really ready to quit... So I was wondering how you're feeling about stopping so abruptly. I know doctors can sometimes be pretty blithe about their recommendations, not thinking through the whole picture and just concentrating on fixing the portion of the problem you've presented them with...\nAbout enzymes. Our first naturopath recommended that we give Isaac pancreatic enzymes. We used a product called \"pancreatin,\" and I think it was by NOW vitamins. It's basically ground up pig pancreases, or something gross like that. We went through a bottle of the stuff, but never noticed any change, and quit. It comes as powder in a capsule, so it was easy to give him--just sprinkled it on his applesauce.\nMy heart also went out to Rita. That feeling of just not knowing how to put all the clues together to FIGURE IT OUT is so FRUSTRATING. Two or three days a month I spend raging around my house, my mind going 100 miles an hour, going over and over and over my notes, articles, the labels of foods and vitamins, just trying to find the thing I missed that will make the whole picture make sense. AGH!!!\nThe picture of Jodi on the floor, scratching rather than yelling for help, is a replica of what Isaac used to do. He does it less now. I don't know if what we did helped, but here's what it was. First, we would go over to him and get right in his face (which sometimes meant lying on the floor so we could look UP at him), and saying something like, \"Looks like you're having a problem here, huh?\" in a concerned, but light voice. Then we'd say, \"I'm going to try to help you!\" Often Isaac would look away, or get this vacant look in his eyes, and keep scratching. So we'd start over. Sometimes we'd have to pick him up, or put him in our laps, to get even enough of his attention to talk to him. The problem with holding him is that he's not forced to acknowledge us. Eventually, we'd get his attention, and then we could talk about the challenge at hand (\"It looks like your blue truck is stuck under the couch... \". OR we'd have to hold his hands, and get into one of those \"counseling sessions\" that I described in my other posting. This seemed to help him, but it takes a lot of attention.\nOut of that, Isaac developed a new \"defense mechanism.\" He started sucking his thumb and twirling his hair--a trick he still uses when he is frustrated or overwhelmed. We prefer this to scratching, but we occasionally try to break this one up, too, just to make sure he isn't \"going away\" to deal with his problem by himself. My trick is another game--I stick my thumb in my mouth, suck on it a second, then pull it out and scream, then laugh. Isaac thinks this is very funny, and he tries it, too.\nI am slowly getting used to the idea that there might not be a final solution to I's eczema--we might always ride this roller coaster. Not easy for a control freak like me.\nDate: 20 Feb 1997 10:32:06 From: Kim Subject: a newcomer\nSue, I have been through about the same thing except have not tried as many treatments. My son's eczema started after alot of antibiotics and we do have ear tubes, I think they were harder on us than him. We have used evening primrose oil topically only and flax seed oil orally. I don't know if they helped but like you I had a problem with high dosage.\nDate: 20 Feb 1997 10:46:25 From: Kim Subject: a newcomer\nWhen my son was tested at 9 months it was a prick test of tiny pins (six I think) on a base that was pressed onto his back. I have been told that prick test doesn't alway tell the whole story till a child is atleast 5 years. Maybe they will do some other test for you.\nDate: 20 Feb 1997 10:53:53 From: Kim Subject: my name\nTina, I read your post about your son not getting to eat what everyone else does. I have been taking my son's lunch to daycare for over a year (he is 2.5) and since he never has eaten what other kids do he doesn't seem to care. He talks about Pizza or HotDogs but never offers to have a fit over not having them. I do send him a special treat when other kids are getting something special for a party or whatever. Anyway don't worry about the having to be different yet. Just maybe it will make him be a leader (not wanting to be like everybody else) and that will be a big plus in the years to come.\nDate: 20 Feb 1997 11:01:00 From: Kim Subject: Child ECZEMA -Reply\nRita, I feel the same way, if I would work just a little harder I could solve my son's problem. I guess we just have to go day-to-day.\nDate: 20 Feb 1997 13:26:22 From: Shelley Subject: Patsy & Issac\nAs Sue described her son Isaac, who scratches when he is frustrated, I realized that I too learned this habit in infancy and never got over it. After 40 years, the habit is so ingrained it is automatic. Nothing else is as satisfying as scratching. It's like the Newton law of physics that says \"every action has an equal and opposite reaction.\" Every frustration I experience seems to require the equal and opposite reaction of scratching. The force of the scratching seems to be the only thing that equals the force of the frustration. I've tried pounding pillows, but that doesn't match the refined motor skill sensation of fingers scratching.\nThe only thing that I've known to give me equal satisfaction is when I can ask a friend to gently rub my back, and of course this has to be a very close friend, and I have to be willing to let myself sink into the feeling in my body at the time. When I can allow myself to really experience the feelings, I can tell that the comforting sensation of a hand rubbing my back is something I never got enough of as an infant/child. That simple gesture means so much to me. My skin was always so bad that I understand why my parents were reluctant to touch me, but I recommend that parents find a way to touch in a repetitive soothing manner, otherwise the child will continue to scratch in desperate efforts to provide the physical sensations they crave.\nAnd scratching is a short-term stimulation, not the deeply fulfilling comfort of tenderness, so scratching just leads to more scratching. It's like junk food, empty calories, you keep eating and eating and you're never full. But if junk food is all you have access to, you keep stuffing your face with it.\nIt's heartbreaking to read all these posts from mothers. They remind me of my childhood of agony and help me have sympathy for my mother who had no one to talk to about her experiences. Those of us who've had eczema all our lives remember the hope that we would grow out of it, and I hate to be a spoil sport and say \"don't get your hopes too high\" because I remember how that hope kept me alive for 14 years. As an adult, I have to find new reasons to live each day.\nToday I'm grateful that my skin is under control. My friend rubbed my back yesterday and that was wonderful. The sun is shining and I'm going out to take a walk.\nDate: 20 Feb 1997 14:12:02 From: David Subject: Triludan (terfenadine)\nI don't think my \"Drugs for Every Occasion\" book exactly says terfenadine is safe. The side effects can be nasty, but are rare and are more likely when it is combined with other drugs.\nIf the FDA has found something new I'd certainly like to know.\nI've had a look at http://www.fda.gov and found nothing on it, but that may be because I didn't know where to look and the search engine didn't work.\nI did find a couple of press releases from the manufacturers and everything is of course all right ;)\nThe press releases are at:\nhttp://www.newspage.com/NEWSPAGE/info/d20/d10/d50/public.pre/public.pre/pub lic.pre/public/A.p0113173.100.prw75100.htm\nand\nhttp://www.newspage.com/NEWSPAGE/info/d20/d10/d50/public.pre/public.pre/pub lic.pre/public.pre/public.pre/public/A.p0107075.800.prw75100.htm\nI would like to get to the bottom of this because I take Triludan for hay fever in the summer, and my mother takes it ALL THE TIME for allergic rhinitis.\nI don't think it's good to take *any* drug all the time, if you can avoid it.\nDate: 20 Feb 1997 14:29:44 From: Linda Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nThanks to all who responded re: mothers of children with E. My heart also goes out to all the moms -- I know what it's like, and it's heartbreaking. It helps to know there are other moms out there going through the same struggle. As I said previously, I suffer from eczema, but I no longer even worry about myself (although I should). Brian started with E at 5 or 6 weeks old... and I cried and cried several times in the beginning blaming myself for \"giving\" this disease to him. It took a while, but I've gotten over the guilt, and realized that it wasn't something I wanted to give him, it's just part of life and heredity. We are trying to help him as best we can right now, but I also believe in prayer. My husband and I pray daily for Brian (and myself) for healing of the eczema. God has been my source of strength through this time.\nShelley: Thanks for your point of view re: touching, physical contact. I do rub Brian's back sometimes, but he scratches his head the most, so I try to rub his head (and massage with baby oil) for him whenever I catch him scratching.\nSue: Thanks for sharing so much about Isaac. I'm glad you found out what the hives were from. Brian's derm was quite blunt -- she wanted me to stop nursing that very day! I just laughed and told her I'd stop as quickly as possible (within a week). It was difficult to stop so suddenly, although I was down to feeding him only 2 or 3 times a day since I work full-time. I do miss that one-on-one contact with him, but he seems to be OK with it. He never gave me any problems going back and forth from breast and bottle. I guess it's a good thing he was used to having a bottle. He has had three ear infections so far and (after reading some of the stories on this list) now I wonder if there's any connection between the antibiotic and the eczema.\nHmmm. .. it will be interesting to find out what exactly he's allergic to. I also eat lots of dairy and peanut butter. I was trying to eat nutritious snacks to keep my weight up -- I kept losing weight while nursing. Of course I also had my share of goodies -- chocolate. It upsets me to think that by nursing, I was causing his eczema, but it's probably true. Sometimes I guess breastfeeding isn't always the best for baby! We started feeding him corn this week, and his back and stomach are broke out again with E. Wonder if he's allergic to it? I'll keep you posted.\nDate: 20 Feb 1997 12:42:35 From: Ken Subject: Leaky Gut\nThe leaky gut concept has been talked about several times here. For those with knowledge on it, please clarify how it can be diagnosed. Thru some kind of test? Is it done thru Derm or Intern?\nMy herb doctor said that seafood can easily cause flare-up. I am throwing it out as I have not seen seafood being mentioned here.\nDate: 20 Feb 1997 13:03:12 From: Tina Subject: Itchy babies and struggling Moms\nI have been reading alot about nursing and eczema and allergies on this list. Our Dr. never said nursing caused E (I nursed just 5 and 1/2 mos) but Daniel was always broke out. I also ate alot of peanut butter, nuts and dairy because I don't like much meat. Now Daniel is allergic to peanuts, but not dairy. The Dr. still says that even though the allergies make the E worse, he will still always have some problem with it since my husband has E and is allergic to dogs and cats. The allergist says Daniel will most likely outgrow the food allergies all but eggs and peanuts, but by the time he is 4 or 5 will become allergic to airborne allergins. Has anyone else been told that?\nOur Dr. also says that E, allergies and asthma all go together. Besides my husbands E and allegies, we have a nephew with bad asthma, and my husband's great grandfather had asthma also. So I do believe it.\nIt is good to know there are other parents out there that have a hard time getting there little ones attention to stop itching. Daniel just sits on the floor, pulls his pant legs up as far as he can, pulls his socks off and scratches til he is almost bleeding. If I am not in the room my 3 and 1/2 year old can be heard yelling----stop scratching!!!!!!----so that's my cue-----\nWhat do I look for in a tar shampoo? What are some well known names? Daniel's head is real flaky and itchy and scabby from scratching. I've been using J and J new sensitive skin formula baby shampoo but it doesn't do any good.\nDate: 20 Feb 1997 15:28:40 From: Tina Subject: my name\nThanks, Kim... I hope it really turns out that Daniel does't care about the food differences. I ordered the video \"Alexander, the Elephant who can't Eat Peanuts\". It is pretty good. Especially at the end it has children with allergies being interviewed. My 3 and 1/2 year old understood what it was about. He goes around telling everyone about how his brother can't have peanuts.\nDate: 20 Feb 1997 20:15:48 From: Bill Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nLast October, I had a major flare that knocked me down for a couple weeks. I had to go to prednisone for the first time in my E. career. After 10 days, I tried to wean off and had a return flare as bad as the first. The prednisone did a great job but I couldn't seem to get off of it. Around that time, I ran into a product that involved a conbination of multivitamin, cheleated minerals, a variety of antioxidants and proanthocyanidins (in the class of bioflavanols. I began these products for a week and then again attempted to wean from prednisone. To my surprise, I did not have any problems. In fact I have not had any E. since, anywhere, except a small 1-inch patch of dry skin on my upper arm that does not grow or itch!\nThis has been a tremendous three months for me. I have caught up on literally years of sleep. I have renewed energy, do not scratch at night and am not experiencing any itching that I cannot easily resist. It would almost appear to me that I mark significant improvements on a weekly basis... especially this last 3 weeks. I have gotten many compliments from friends and family on the condition of my facial skin, my eyes (which were typically so bloodshot that it looked as if I had been on an extended bender) and the fact that I look rested. My wife and children have noted a definite positive change in my demeanour. I am not on the edge of constant irritation and feel that I have had my sense of humour return! I think the midnight scratch-fests and constant irritation sapped my energy reserves over the years. Maybe I am getting some of that well needed energy back now.\nDate: 20 Feb 1997 23:57:02 From: Christopher Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nBill, please post this new miracle vitamin regimen to the list! You KNOW that I'll be the first to try it, no matter how badly it puts me financially \"in the hole.\" Please post it. I've gotten rid of 90% of my problems, and now if I can just get rid of that last 10%, I'll be so very happy. Please note, that the vitamin regimen I listed above needs to have vitamin C added to it. We've been out of that for a few weeks, and I have noticed that since it being neglected, the eczema has worsened just a bit. But yes, WHAT is this miracle cure?\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 10:05:54 From: Sue Subject: Childhood Eczema\nShelley--It is so interesting that the repetitive motion of a backrub can help actually quell the itching for you. It gives me hope that we CAN do something to break this cycle of scratching that our kids are just building now. Kids are smart--they'll find all kinds of ways to substitute for what they know they need, but aren't getting. I wonder if you could find people to rub your back for a few hours every day, if you could help your skin. The world owes you a lot of catch-up back-rubbing!\nI think it was Linda who talked about the guilt feelings of passing her eczema on to her kid. I still struggle with that one, because right after Isaac was born, we took him to a naturopath who told me I should immediately take all dairy, corn, wheat, and peanuts from my diet, as long asI was nursing him. The guy had a terrible \"bedside manner,\" and I was so pissed off at his seeming disregard for what *I* needed that I didn't follow his advice. I was starving! I'd had gestational diabetes for the last 2 months of pregnancy, which I controlled with diet, not drugs, so I just couldn't get enough to eat. Then I could not eat enough to maintain my weight while breastfeeding, and then he tells me to cut out foods that represent about 90% of my calories.\nI know I did the best I could. But if I could have gotten over the hurt from his manner, and enlisted my husband's help in figuring out a new diet (instead of feeling defensive because he agreed with the guy's recommendation), it probably would have helped Isaac. I bring this up because it highlights how complicated this whole thing is, and how important it is to have some care-givers who are sensitive to the whole picture...\nI have never had eczema, but some of my insights that I use to help Isaac come from growing up with a younger sister who was very debilitated by it. Sometimes we even had to carry her because her skin was so bad that if she walked, scabs would break open and she'd bleed. Feelings of anger, guilt, and frustration at my parents still cloud my thinking now, esp. when I remember the times that I didn't help my sister because her whining and scratching were driving ME crazy. After years in a Zen training center and a major diet change, my sister now has good control over her skin, and she is very articulate about the emotional hurts that her scratching helped keep at bay.\nShe's also a great source of advice on Isaac. She's the one who told me to start the \"Just say \"no\" to scratching\" technique. I'd thought that interrupting him would just make him more frustrated, or angry (he sure reacted that way!). But she said she thought that babies confronted with such terrible itchiness NEEDED their parents to step in and stop them--they just weren't strong enough to help themselves. The trick, however (which my parents did NOT do with her) was to stay loving and close and be willing to put up with the tirades that would come with forcing him to stop... when I think of all the nights that that little girl lay in her bed, with socks pinned over her hands, moaning and crying, I cry. Every time.\nJeez, this is such an emotional topic! What can we do to help the traditional (and even alternative) medical profession deal with that fact?\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 09:54:41 From: Kay Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nWe just started using a tar shampoo for EJ. It is \"Nutrogena T\" and we found it at the grocers after seeing an ad on television. The timing was interesting because we had talked to an old-time pharmacist who swore by tar shampoo for cradle cap for his children (now grown) but said he couldn't remember the last time he had some in the store.\nThen I saw the ad and walked out and bought it.\nI haven't been using the shampoo long enough to see how it works. It smells like the parking lot at Six Flags on a sunny day (creosote) and I wonder if it will be too harsh.\nEJ just recently took up scratching his scalp. The rest of his body is totally free of eczema now (big HOORAY with Lac-Hydrin 5), but his scalp is a mess of dandruff.\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 09:28:13 From: Patsy Subject: ECZEMA Digest\nLet me reiterate a cure I found for my daughter's cradle cap: Head & Shoulders Shampoo. I tried it on a hunch after having dealt with all the useless salves and ointments the MD had prescribed. It took the second application, but she never had the problem again.\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 11:29:18 From: Sue Subject: eczema->athsma connection\nAbout the connection between eczema and later respiratory difficulties... The medical community uses the concept of \"atopia\" to describe people who have a predisposition to allergic reactions... they predict it based on family histories of allergies. For example, when Isaac's skin was terrible, by age 8 or 9 months, our doctors assured us that he was \"atopic,\" (we both had allergies as kids; my husband still has them), and that it was very likely that he'd a) be in the 40% of babies who kept their eczema for their whole lives; and b) develop athsma when he got older. Signs they looked for were: eczema (alraedy obvious); ear cracks (where his ear lobe meets his head--a pretty constant crack there); creased eyelids (instead of just one fold in his eyelid, there were always a couple, both top and bottom); etc.\nOur natural practitioners have given us a very different view on this \"atopia\" idea. In their opinion, kids retain these symptoms for their whole lives because doctors don't CHANGE anything that CAUSES the problems--they just deal with the manifestations--quiet the skin with steroids, open the bronchial tubes with inhalants, etc. So the body just keeps manifesting the underlying problems--first through eczema, then through athsma, etc.\nI don't think that anyone believes that eczema or asthma is caused by just one thing, so it's really hard to ever wipe out the root cause. But I think we can to lots of things to attack the problem ENOUGH so that the body can take over and heal itself. I think the leaky guy syndrome is one example of a cause--if substances are leaking into the wrong body cavities and causing problems, then the body will manifest this problem with eczema, maybe. Fix the leaks, or remove the offending substances that leak, and the skin can get better. And maybe (and I guess this is faith) the body can eventually heal itself if it can get out of the cycle long enough to \"catch up\".\nSo I am refusing to believe the inevitability of the eczema-athsma progression. And examples from this list give me hope. People are finding the right combinations of vitamins, diets, allergen avoidance, emotional assistance, etc., and are actually getting better. At age 10 months, our doctors were convinced that Isaac was \"atopic\" (and he was, in their definition). They are amazed at what he looks like now--no extra eyelid folds, no ear cracks, a clear face, etc. His legs are still a mess, but they're getting better. And they are actually suggesting now that maybe he WILL be part of the 60% of baby eczema sufferers who WILL outgrow it. Now, of course, they attribute his improvement to pure aging--he \"grew out of it.\" Very convenient.\nAnd even if he doesn't--we will keep looking for underlying causes. And avoiding the antibiotics and steroids. I would put money on a bet that in the next twenty years, they will find that antibiotics and steroids contribute to the progression from eczema to athsma... just a guess.\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 11:27:50 From: Lynn Subject: Nature's Biotics\nChristopher, Your supplement list included Nature's Biotics. I read their advertising on the Internet and it sounds like a miracle; but then again, it is their own advertising. Can you elaborate a little on your personal experience with it. If anyone else has used it, please chime in.\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 13:42:05 From: Heather Subject: Fabric stores, clothes shopping, and E.\nI was just rereading a supportive message from Royce (thank you again!) re: wedding dresses and E., in which she mentions turning a lovely shade of bright eczematic red when she went dress shopping. I just wanted to second her itch, if I may. ;-) I've noticed that when I'm clothes shopping or fabric shopping, my hands frequently start acting up (getting hot & itchy; patches of E. start to redden). My dermatologist doesn't think that my E. is allergy-related, but I do know that textile manufacturers treat fabrics with a number of chemicals, including formaldehyde, which probably don't do much for us E. sufferers!\nAlso, with wedding dress-shopping in particular, there may be emotional baggage aggravating the E. (been there!).\nBy the way, I went dress pattern shopping with my grandmother & mother and chose a pattern with a cap sleeve and high-cut back which looks stylish, but which doesn't make me feel uncomfortable. When my mum suggested something with a low back or no sleeves, I just said, \"Well, I don't know how my skin will feel that day, and I'd be happier in a different dress.\" She agreed, and the whole process was much more low- key than I expected (no attempts on her part to find the \"cause\" of my E., etc.). Thank you again, everyone, for listening.\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 13:57:49 From: Jolie Subject: To: Rita-Child E\nDear Rita, If only we could do something! My son reacts strongly to smoke filled rooms and antique stores, this is in addition to his food intollerances. Your daughter is on the same diet as my son but we have not embarked on the Chinese herbs. I do worry about enough vitamins, my homeopathic MD recommended essential minerals, it did make a difference. He also recommended other vitamins but I am still in search of something he can chew or tollerate. In your list of foods you mentioned carrots, not in our camp. We have had success with lamb, turkey, butternut squash, baby food squash, prunes, peas and spinach. What chinese vegetables is she taking?\nBy the way, I am the leaky gut person, my gastroenterologist diagnosed his as a birth defect. He placed him on a special diet along with the anti histamine (periactin). I use the periactin when he has a bad flare up, it does help. Next I am trying Debbie's suggestion of a chiropractor.\nHave you looked into the dust mite issue?\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 13:59:40 From: Rita Subject: Child ECZEMA\nIt is true everyone's E is different but I suppose all E sufferers share something in common.\nSue - Though the viral attack started a month ago, Jodi still has a few scattered blister-like rashes broke out on her skin here and there. When I see them, I put tea tree oil ointment over them to avoid secondary infection. They usually dry up and go away in 2-3 days. I only hope that Isaac's viral infection is not going to get as ugly as Jodi's. When blisters show up on eczematic skin, topical antibiotic helps to stop infection from getting out of hand. Try not to use systemic antibiotic. It won't stop the viral attack and it destroys good flora. I also give ecchinacea-for-children and an herbal extract drink to my kids to boost their immune system.\nBreast-feeding Linda & Tina - It's not difficult to continue breast feeding your baby even if your dr asked you to stop for a while. I rented an industrial breast pump when my milk first came in and when we needed to go out and Jodi's still sleeping, I pumped it out for later use. Unlike manual breast pumps, the industrial pump is very gentle on your skin and does the job really quickly. I tried 2 manual once, couldn't stand them. I was also advised not to breast feed my baby for a week to see if breast milk was the culprit. I went right back to nursing Jodi when the expedition made no difference to her E. I also stopped drinking milk myself when I resumed breast feeding. Though Jodi's E is not a result of milk protein or milk sugar, I think it's worth testing to see if your E baby is allergic to cow milk or soy by replacing regular formula with Alimentum or if you nurse, try avoiding all products with milk protein or milk sugar or soy if you could. Speaking from experience, I believe breast milk is the best for babies. Don't give it up just because your dr asks you to.\nTina - I suppose when it comes atopy, the bottom line is really bad genes. Did you try Head & Shoulder? I notice that when I wash Jodi's hair everyday, her E clears up on her scalp.\nSue - I absolutely agree with you that games are the best for E babies. Since Jodi doesn't like to lie on her belly, and seems to like standing up like everyone else in the family, one of our favorite games is that while I sit in the center of a couch, I ask Jodi to get a toy from one end of the couch and give it to me. Then, I'll have Juliet puts the toy to the other end so Jodi will have to go fetch it again. Being right in the center of the couch allows me to stop Jodi from falling when she loses her balance. This game keeps both girls happy and they both have my attention.\nShanon - I'm beginning to believe it's something in the air which cause Jodi her E. We're moving the end of this month. I hope it's THE right move for Jodi. I'm thinking about getting someone to do a comprehensive air testing in our new home. Hopefully, Jodi's E will get better. I never thought my E may come back to haunt me but is not so sure anymore. The last time I had a flare up was 2 weeks before I gave birth to Juliet, my older one. I had it really bad all over my belly but it went away as soon as I gave birth to Juliet. I sometimes wonder if I had had a flare up when I was pregnant with Jodi, she would not have had her E.\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 11:45:22 From: Tina Subject: Itchy heads and new clothes\nThanks to all who wrote about kid's scalps. Daniel's head looks really bad. I am going to try Head and Shoulders first, since there is some of that in my bathroom already. Then we'll see the results. I was kind of concerned about it being strong and burning his raw spots. Then if that doesn't work I will look for the Nutregena T.\nAbout new clothes. Daniel has broke out after wearing an outfit that was new at Christmas and it was washed before he wore it... but maybe the load was too big and didn't get rinsed thoroughly. Our allergist said there are chemicals in the clothes to make them hang nicely on the racks... I use to work in retail and would stock shelves and just the chemicals from the cardboard would make me red and itchy---I don't have E.\nSue, Thanks for the imput on E, allergies and asthma. I really do hope that nothing else develops over time. I have hard enough time with the food and itching. Sometimes I just feel totally overwhelmed with the whole situation. My husband actually has more of an understanding than I do since he has E. He remembers when he was a toddler that he use to take a receiving blanket and wrap it around his arms so he wouldn't scratch too hard. Sad. His Mom kept a piece of it in his scapbook... She thinks he just loved his blankie...\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 20:21:01 From: Faith Subject: What's next\nSue writes something that struck a nerve with me.\nExactly. I think that, in general, with most chronic problems, modern western medicine seems to do just this. The question I have is how do we find someone who *can* help us work toward the cause?? I mentioned a week or two ago that I was going to push my dermatologist in this direction, and I have had a start down that road. He drew blood for one set of tests, and has me scheduled for an allergy patch test (aagh! can't use the antihistamines for 2 days before or the 2 days during, no baths or showers during... I'm gonna be a mess!). If something shows up, he'll see what he can do to help it. If not, he said something that I noted immediately -- \"We'll just have to call it eczema, and you'll just have to live with it\".\nWhat that tells me is, if we don't come up with anything in this round of testing, I'll just have to drop the guy and move on to the next doctor, or naturopath, or whatever. He can call it whatever he wants -- that doesn't mean I have to \"just live with it\"! The trick is finding the next specialist to move to...\nSue also mentioned something that she had done with Isaac (and I note many of the other parents on here are doing), where she breaks him away from scratching, but in a loving, helpful way. Anybody got any ideas on how I can teach my husband to do that??? I think I need to sit down with him and tell him that his blunt \"stop that scratching\" doesn't help me stop. As I told him once, \"You're easier to ignore than the itch is... \" Yes, I know that my scratching is making things worse. Yes, I know that my scratching is just prolonging the flare-up. And yes, I know my scratching is probably keeping him awake at night as much as it does me. But there's a BIG difference between knowing and being able to do something about it, sometimes... and feeling like I have to hide my scratching or get lectured only makes things worse... I like the suggestion someone made of getting a backrub to take one's mind away from the scratching! :) And frankly, now that I think about it... there are some other things he has done in the past that have taken my mind off the scratching, too... < blush blush > :) :)\nAnyways, just had to get that off my chest...\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 15:52:03 From: Heather Subject: The helpfulness of \"Don't SCRATCH!\"\nWhen I start scratching, I immediately put some lotion on, or anti-itch cream (Sarna) or steroid ointment, depending on how the E. looks (dry, bumpy, etc.). My fiance does this for me if I can't reach the itchy spot, and I find that putting something on it really does help. Also, We sometimes play a game where I hug him if I'm still itchy after putting lotion on; I hug him as many times as I feel itchy. It does take my mind off the itchiness! He tells me not to scratch, which is helpful when I'm not aware that I'm doing it.\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 13:38:40 From: Tina Subject: Stop Scratching\nI know that backrubs help Daniel, too. Sometimes when he is scratching alot I lay him across my lap and rub his back and down his legs. I guess kind of a softer form of scratching since a 16 mo old can't understand softer. He will lay there as long as I want to rub. Using Eucerin after bath time, he likes the rub down also.\nDo any of the children out there use their teeth to scratch themselves? Daniel scrubs his teeth along his wrists and hands... this makes them look pretty raw and swollen on top of the normal dry and cracking. It is very hard to get him to stop once he gets going.\nSue and Faith-----our first Dr. said of Daniel's bad skin----he just has Eczema, like his Dad. There would't be any allergies, not many kids really have allergies. It was my husband and I who pursued seeing an allergist and seeing if anything was actually causing it or at least making it worse than it really had to be. Behold, he has all sorts of food allergies! Peanut being bad enough to need to tote the Epi-Pen! Makes me wonder sometimes...\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 17:03:42 From: Christopher Subject: Nature's Biotics\nWhere did you find the Nature's Biotics site? I found it LONG ago, but lost it, and can't find it. The stuff is great though. I could see a substantial effect within only a few days of taking it. The problem is that you MUST take it the way it says, or it will cease to have an effect. My problem is that I cannot financially afford the dosage that it asks. I have noticed that since I have kept it at the two capsules a day, it has had no more effect, and its effect has actually lessened. It's great stuff though, at least from my observations.\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 17:16:40 From: Christopher Subject: Stop Scratching\nWell, now that you mention it, yes, at one time I *did* use my teeth to scratch myself, and did so quite regularly up until about a year ago (when I started trying to take care of the stuff... by simply NOT SCRATCHING even though it about drove me out of my mind, as well as experiments with vitamin supplements. I thought I was the only one who did that. My parents called me a \"vampire.\" <g>\nThough it is not one of the most pleasant things in the world, it is not as bad for the skin in my opinion as just plain scratching. And in truth, it was much more effective in stopping the itching than many of the treatments the doctors prescribed. <g> But seriously, I know what he is going through. And if later he thinks having eczema as a child is bad, wait until he gets to become a teenager. Thanks be to God that there are actually some beautiful females my age out there who don't care that much about looks (and subsequently, will date me). But hey, I wish him luck, and I know EXACTLY what he is going through.\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 20:11:20 From: Ralph Subject: Dermatitis Herpetiformis\nI received the following note about ten days ago, and am finally getting around to passing it along. I can't vouch for the relevance or accuracy of what follows, knowing nothing about Dermatitis Herpetiformis myself, but I'm hoping someone on the list will be able to comment on how this might relate (or not relate, I guess) to our shared problem.\nOut in the newsgroups I have several times found people that thought they had \"eczema\" but really had undiagnosed dermatitis herpetiformis.\nFor images of severe cases see: http://www.panix.com/~donwiss/index.shtml#DH\nThen there is is Peter Thompson's web page at http://www.demon.co.uk:80/webguides/nutrition/diets/gluten-free/ with an article written by Dr. Joseph Murray (University of Iowa Medical School).\nDate: 22 Feb 1997 01:43:15 From: Carol Subject: Teeth for scratching -\nYup, I have used my teeth to scratch the itch on my wrists. I'm quiet on this list now as thankfully, my problems have subsided for the time being. I stay on here because all the info is so interesting and because I know sooner or later, I'll have a flare-up again, which will be caused by stress. Last time I had a problem was in the fall when I had a scare with my mammogram. So there I was, disrobing for practically the whole world to see, and my arms bright red with excema! Such is life! I have to say, *all* who saw it didn't flinch and seemed quite at ease with it.\nDate: 21 Feb 1997 21:11:00 From: Wendy Subject: What's next\nI had that patch test (T.R.U.E. I believe) done twice and it showed nothing. It cost $400.00 each time too. Yesterday I went and had some food allergy testing done and once again NOTHING. They also did a blood test to test my thyroid. I hate to say this but I hope something show up, at least I would know what is causing this. I know what you mean when you talk about scratching during the night. Last week during a nighttime scratching frenzy (must have taken the socks off my hands!) I tore part of a mole off. I then had to go have it removed which was real pleasant. My regular dermatologist was in Hawaii (probably funded by me) and the doctor filling in for him actually joked with me about my eczema. I kinda let him have it. This really gets frustrating. I hope your patch test shows something.\nDate: 22 Feb 1997 02:06:34 From: Kathy Subject: over-the-counter/prescription drugs & E\nHas anyone looked at the \"Cutaneous Drug Reaction Database\" at Dartmouth? gopher://gopher.dartmouth.edu:70/11/Research/BioSci/CDRD\nAlmost all drugs have side effects of dermatitis (eczema), psoriasis, pruritis (itching), pityriasis, etc.\nI developed eczema after taking an antibiotic. It was necessary - nothing I could do about it. I wonder though, if we are not perpetuating the problem, by taking these legal drugs so often. I have had rashes, pityriasis rosea and eczema. These skin diseases always show up after I take a drug for awhile. Thank goodness for pyrithione zinc.\nI would like to hear some opinions on the drug/E relationship. The information in the database seems to speak for itself.\nDate: 22 Feb 1997 14:37:13 From: Shelley Subject: What's next\nFaith: You have already have some answers to your own question, as noted above. It's good that you've recognized the problem. Now you need to find the right time to talk to your husband about how he can help you. Pick a time when there are no other distractions and he can give you his full attention. Just open the conversation saying something like \"Honey, I figured out something important about my skin and I need your help with it. You know how I scratch in the night? Well, what I think would help me to stop is if you could... \" Spell out the details about specifics that he could do (without saying anything about his actions in the past NOT being helpful) and then ask him \"What do you think? Does this sound like something you could do? Or is there some part that wouldn't work for you?\" and just have a frank discussion about the situation, what works and doesn't work, without blaming each other for anything.\nIf you have difficulty bringing up the subject, try practicing either by yourself or with a friend. Or here online with the group. If you can open the conversation, you can bring some improvement to the situation. And every bit helps. You are fortunate in having a loved one who is there for support. They just need instruction. Otherwise they are ignorant about what is helpful and what isn't. Best wishes...\nDate: 22 Feb 1997 13:50:41 From: Patsy Subject: Faith's Delimma\nFaith- I'm wondering if your husband has some bad habits it's hard for him to break? For example, would he find it helpful if you constantly said, \"Lose Weight!\" or \"Stop Smoking!\" I expect he would not only not find it likely to help him, but he'd find it debilitating. Shoe on other foot?\nDate: 22 Feb 1997 15:49:17 From: Christopher Subject: hello again\nWhat I find the hardest to deal with is the \"dryness\" of the skin (as well as in the past, the \"cracking, blotchiness, and bleeding\"). It is NOT the most pleasant thing in the world, especially if you date fairly regularly. <g> My eczema was most active on my hands, and feet, though at times it attacked my ears badly.\nStrangely enough, my allergist never recommended zinc (which does quite well), nor any of the vitamins I take. When I suggested them one time while talking with him, he shrugged them off. I tried them anyway, and I have had great success. <g>\nDate: 23 Feb 1997 09:51:53 From: Wayne Subject: Triludan (terfenadine)\nI found a posting I made to this list on Sep 10, 95 that refers to a warning I read about in the National Psoriasis Foundation's Pharmacy Newsletter (v6#2, Jul 94, p9). This is what the NPF warning s says: \"Do you take either terfenadine, an allergy medicine sold as Seldane, or ketoconazole, which is used to treat skin infections? If so, you should know the following. Recent research has shown that when combined, these two medications can cause fatal changes in heart rhythm. So never take these two medications together. For more information, contact your physician.\" Note that Seldane is an antihistamine that is not supposed to make you sleepy, and the ketoconazole, I assume, is an antibiotic (because the warning mentions that it is used to treat skin infections).\nDate: 23 Feb 1997 23:07:16 From: Faith Subject: Faith's Delimma\nThanks, everyone, for some great ideas on how to deal with my husband on this. I think Patsy's given me the one angle that's going to help me help him understand, though!\nPutting the shoe on the other foot may indeed strike a nerve with him. His mother was after him, for many years, to lose weight. Every time we saw her over those years, it was inevitable that she would, at some point in the visit, bring up the matter of his weight, either with him directly or through me. It got to a point where he avoided seeing her at all, simply to keep her from harassing him about it. Ultimately, he has managed to lose much of the weight (and she's quite proud of him for it!), but it had nothing to do with her harassment and everything to do with finding a way to do it that he could live with.\nIf I can explain to him that I want very much to stop scratching, but need to find a way to do it that I can live with, as he needed to do with his weight, then I believe he will understand. And given that I'm in the middle of a particularly itchy flare-up at the moment, this may come in handy...\nDate: 22 Feb 1997 03:08:05 From: Debi Subject: To: E Baby moms\nI feel overwhelmed, there are quite a few of us who have babies with severe E. Debbie, Rita, Jolie, Karen and more. Let's get organized, lets spend this week listing foods that work. The following week lets talk about ointments, creams, external aids. Perhaps the 3rd week we can discuss homeopathy or alternatives. We are all anxious to help our little ones and we all have so much we can share. I hope you agree with me. I will send another message tonight and call it E Baby Food. Add on your successful foods, by the end of the week we can print one list and start testing new foods for our little ones.

She's allergic to dust mites and of course cat and rabbit fur. We've been to most of the dermatologists in local practice, as well as a homeopathic clinic. I think the homeopathic stuff may have strengthened Nadia's immune system, because after the regimine was complete she almost never had staph infections. She still suffers almost constant itching, flaking, thin skin and naturally the scratches she inflicts on herself.\nIt would be great to have Lyncoln e-mail Nadia directly, so they can kid-talk about their experiences.\nDate: Thu, 1 Feb 1996 00:39:04 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: Food\nRichard: I am extremely allergic to nuts and seeds, and avoid or reduce intake of caffeine, sugar, salt, citrus, and dairy products to keep my condition under control.

I was never told it was contagious. Shouldn't the doctors have mentioned that? And makes me wonder how I got it. I only get them on my face. Mostly on my eyelids, but I did have one on my cheek. How long is the incubation period? You say they're supposed to just curl up and die by themselves, but mine never did. I had my first two for nearly a year before removing them. The dermatologist said they were harmless and need only be removed for cosmetic reasons. I tried to live with them but eventually decided I couldn't stand looking at them anymore. I went to an eye doctor for the surgery since my dermatologist said he didn't feel comfortable working in the delicate area of the eye. The eye doctor is the one who told me it was a virus and if not removed could cause blindness. Since then I get them removed within 6 months, but they've never gone away by themselves.\nDate: Thu, 1 Feb 1996 17:01:28 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: What about food?\nI tried drops under the tongue along with a diet that excluded all dairy, and anything with gluten! It nearly killed me--a whole year of the most boring foods imaginable. I got all the gluten-free cookbooks and made my own rice bread, etc. It was fine the first time eaten just out of the oven. After that, it was like eating plain grain; it would all crumble and fall apart in your hands. It was quite expensive eating that kind of diet. And I am an avid bread and ice cream fan! I lost a lot of weight. Finally, I just got tired of it. When I went back to milk, I could no longer tolerate it at all--milk now makes so miserable I can only tolerate minute amounts periodically. I used to like cereal, but that's impractical. I skip breakfast entirely now becuz there's just not much to bother with anymore. Most meat makes be gag if I have to fix my own, so I stick with veggie casseroles and vegburgers, things like that. Veg pizza is a big favorite--no grease.

I know mine is the result of overuse of steroids that were much too strong for too long a period, like 10 yrs. All the male derm's I saw insisted I had acne; it was only a woman derm dr who knew immediately what was wrong with me! I chalk it up to arrogance and failure to listen on their part. Maybe ignorance, too.\nThat is a novel idea--it never occurred to me to consider a dry massage. Is it strictly hands on with nothing to lubricate? For how much time can you tolerate it?\nDate: Thu, 1 Feb 1996 23:11:21 EST From: Gilbert Subject: Re: molluscum\nHi, Shelley. Yes, with some folk the so-called \"benign\" molluscum can be problematic. Blepharitis (i.e., inflammation of the eyelids) and conjunctivitis can sometimes be associated with molluscum. I say \"associated\" because oftentimes there are several things at play here. For example, if a contact dermatitis arises due to, say, allergies caused by agents like eye drops or cosmetics, the irritation can provide a seeding bed for molluscum or, for that matter, for any pathogenic contaminant. And, though we usually don't realize it, our hands are all over our faces. Hands (esp. fingers) can carry bacteria and viruses better than any inanimate fomite I know of. Of course, I'm not saying that hands are the culprit, but whenever I think of routes by which skin infections get launched, I always think: hands. So, I would wonder about contact allergies. At least, I would not want to forget them.\nMore to the point, molluscum with its little elevated lid-margin tumors has a \"tendency\" with some people to \"set up house.\" When so, it's probably because there (is/was) a follicular conjunctivitis that's claimed squatter's rights and become chronic -- and sometimes secretively so. If this is the case, it seems to be due to the toxic effect of viral particles (i.e., incomplete virions) that have gotten shed. Then there's something of a vicious cycle with \"reoccurrences\" of the \"same.\" And, sure enough, when these forces are at play, the bug doesn't just whither away.\nLike you, I don't know why physicians tend to be poor communicators. I think your dermatologist, however, communicated well in referring you on to an eye specialist. Any phenomenon around the eye is \"hands off\" for nonspecialists to my way of thinking. I'm sorry you've had repeated bouts with our (usually) \"benign\" and \"lazy\" virus. And, even here, the degree of the problem is, as we see, quite dependant on the individual who presents with the problem. Just because molluscum is not the \"big\" issue of herpes viruses popping up in the periorbital region, does not for a moment say that it cannot or must not be a problem. Perhaps a number of medical people don't really appreciate that; maybe they're accustomed to needing a staph explosion or a herpetic crisis to warrant \"medical advice.\" Communication is a critical event in the history of successful treatments.\nActually, the sort of issue you've brought up here, is one of the things that interests me about the topic of eczema. I'm concerned with infection. Eczema itself is not an infection. Eczema, however, in the context of its effect, can be a cause for infection insofar as its lesions can lead to a violation of skin integrity, whether that violation is primary or secondary. At that point, we have an issue that needs to be and, probably, can be addressed. Hence, doctors, nurses, the role of the fields of medicine. Hence, communication. This forum, too, is a module for communication and brings its own eye witnesses.\nDate: Fri, 2 Feb 1996 07:55:20 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Re: What about food?\n>> It nearly killed me--a whole year of the most boring foods imaginable. <<\nWow, a year.

Would these two factors account in large measure to the problem of perpetually itchy eyelids? Even when I take great pains to keep my hands off, the eyelids still itch and I end up itching and rubbing them in my sleep. This is after I've showered and washed my face well with Cetaphil and even the eye soaps before going to bed. When I've had longer \"hands off\" periods, my eyes feel better and the side effects of weeping eyes and blurry vision recede as well. So I know I am creating a lot of my own eye problems. But it's nearly impossible not to rub the eyes when the cursed itch lingers.\nDate: Fri, 2 Feb 1996 04:34:33 CST From: Kristen Subject: Re: What about food?\n>> Wow, a year. I'm impressed. But did it help your eczema? <<\nThat's really a good question. At the time, I was so busy working two jobs and because I think I have a tendency to repress past eczema miseries, I don't remember specifics about the eczema. My impression after a year was that it wasn't very significant or I think I would have thought it was worthwhile to stick with it. I just felt so deprived and irritated, I decided \"the h--- with it.\"\nI would actually like to lose weight. That episode was 20 years ago, and most of the weight stayed off for about 20 years. The one thing I do recall, on retroflecting, is that when I have been so busy that my mind is totally occupied with many other things, when I literally have no time for the eczema, it ceased to dominate my life. Guess that's why I believe the psyche is a great part of the eczema puzzle.\nYes, supposedly breakfast is of prime importance. But if you can't have milk on cereal, no wheat products (no toast, no pancakes, no bran, no oatmeal), no anything that contains gluten (and most flour items have gluten), I got bored silly on a total fruit and vegetable diet.\nI do eat meat occasionally; about twice a year I order filet. And I microwave bacon occasionally. If I have chicken, it's usually in small amounts. Generally it doesn't appeal to me. Never eat sandwich or processed meat, or sausages. Something about the texture repels me on the tongue!\nFeeling like Ingrid Bergman can't be ALL bad, I guess. I think the thing about eczema that irritates me is that it deprives one of so many things--activities, foods, risks one dare not take or pay the consequences. Years ago when I went camping, knowing I would be miserable by the end of it, recovery was long and excruciating. I was much more self-conscious about it then, and it was my personal, very dark secret that had to be kept hidden at all costs. It was a huge constraint; I felt like I was living my life in a strait jacket.\nI very much appreciate your reply, Ralph. Don't think I've ever \"said\" how I really felt about this problem before. It's something of a relief! When I was growing up, most things were off-limits for discussion, least of all my particular problem.\nDate: Fri, 2 Feb 1996 09:45:47 ... From: Richard Subject: Thin Skin\nI've been told about \"thin skin\" and topical steroid use since I started the AD ride 30 years ago. Well, I was in the Doc's and I looked at my arms in the neon light. They have a bluish cast which looks like light bruises. The doc said \"thin skin\" and it's reversible. I have to tell you that I got really scared. So my question is, has anyone dealt with this? Does it clear up? Is it topical or systemic or both? How long does it take to clear up? What happens when one has thin skin? Is the meat on my arms going to fall out?\nDate: Fri, 2 Feb 1996 13:57:47 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: Massage\nKris, I get an hour massage, and could actually take more. I first got into getting massage as a child when a doctor \"prescribed\" it. I had to get a massage every day that my skin could handle it and I've been hooked ever since. It's a very interesting psychological experience to get massage. It's much easier for me to receive the touch by a professional giving me a massage, than it is for me to be touched by a loved one, though I have been doing much better with that lately. When I get a professional massage, I surrender to the treatment like I do when going to all doctors. I just go limp and let them do what they're supposed to do to me. And it feels so good.\nEvery time I get a massage, I think about how scratching is a twisted attempt to get this touch that I crave and how I am insatiable for this feeling. Yet with loved ones, I usually feel uncomfortable getting touched much, for a variety of reasons, mostly to do with it getting tangled up with my emotional response to the touch. It triggers old fears and grief and anger and it's not entirely pleasant the way it is with a professional who is just doing a job and emotions have nothing to do with it.\nActually emotions DO get triggered when I get a professional massage but I enjoy that because I can just lay there and think about them intellectually and objectively. I don't have to interact and explain my complicated feelings to the other person, I can just examine them privately and it's interesting to experience it. When you have this condition your entire life, it effects you more profoundly than you can ever explain to anyone. It's as if all my frenzied scratching is not an attempt to get at parasites under the skin but to somehow touch and comfort my aching soul that has endured so much agony. When I get a massage, tears often come to my eyes. For me, it is the only pure pleasure of the skin and I have it in my will that if possible, I want a massage to be my last experience before I die...\nDate: Fri, 2 Feb 1996 07:35:35 -0600 Subject: Re: Thin Skin\nHi Richard, I couldn't help laughing at your last comment! Wayne and I have a half-century of living with eczema. I don't know if he has used steroids as much as I have, but somehow the thin skin seems to perpetuate itself as more thin skin. It hasn't \"reversed\" itself in my experience. The skin in the bends of my arms is so thin that I have very prominent veins that protrude and are easily seen. No digging to find a vein when I have blood drawn! When I was at boot camp for ARNG 20 yrs ago,, some of my sister privates reported me to the commander, and I was asked about drug use! I was very amused--I had enuf problems without using needles. What was more amazing to me is that anyone noticed it; I never examined other people's arms just in passing!\nBut with cortisone use, if I bump or pinch myself anywhere from the waist up, I get huge blood blisters that take a long time to recede. I conclude that the blood is very near the surface, and I bleed easily. Altho I also clot rapidly, so it's nothing to worry about, I guess. Thin skin for me has meant extreme sensitivity to hot humid weather or cold--just about everything that most people don't even think about. Limiting oneself has become a way of life for me; kinda second nature now.\nDate: Fri, 2 Feb 1996 14:34:48 EST From: Wayne Subject: This & That\nAll this talk about food made me hungry, so I eat carry-out (Moo Goo Gai Pan !) as I do this. You see, I am not allergic to any- thing except certain peppers in Mexican food. When I hit one, however small piece of the pepper, I break out into a raging sweat. (We have not talked about AD and sweat glans yet). I am lucky I have chronic AD that is widespread and dry/ with only oozing flare-upsand different levels of itch.\nOn itch, I notice3 kinds. Type one is the kind of itch that one or two scratches takes it away for good. Type two, I'll call Shelley's Orgasmic itch, which invites more itch until skin is torn up. Type three is an area itch in that you can't point to the exact spot that invites scratch. Behaviorally I have to keep from the temptation of Recreational Scrathing. Shelley, your idea of looking at the scratch really makes sense, and works for me sometimes. There is something about the raging Orgasmic scratch where I almost automatically turn away from the sight of the damage. I'm lucky so far, in that I don'g have problems with molluscum, itchy eyes, palm blisters, etc.\nFor me, what works from the inside is the Chinese Herbal Tea being used in the US & UK.

The doctors really scared me with all their warnings. Now thin skin is just something I live with like all the other limitations of this condition. The main effect as I age is that my skin tears so much more easily than it did when I was younger. I remember I used to be able to scratch really hard and the damage was a certain amount, but now I will get the same amount of damage just from scratching lightly (what I consider lightly). So I have to be more careful. And I think it tends to get infected more easily because it tears more easily. It's interesting that Kris mentioned the bruising effects. I get that too but I had assumed it was because I inherited my mother's chronic leukemia. Hearing Kris, I think it's more likely that my bruising is connected to my thin skin...\nDate: Sun, 4 Feb 1996 15:02:28 EST From: Wayne Subject: Skin after 50 years\nHi eczema community: This thin skin conversation is making me think about that issue because I don't think I have thin skin now. My skin was thin before the period in 1979/80 when I was hospitalized for AD for one week. Before that time I had been taking pregnisone (not sure about the spelling) to fight back a major flare-up. I was red all over, oozing, and shivering in the summer heat (because I did not have much of an outer layer of skin to insulate, so I was losing heat in the summer!).\nAnyway, I have not taken pregnisone since. I have never used a lot of topical steroids. Probably I use two to three tubes of Lidex and Triamsinolone (sp) a year.Even during my July 95 flare-up I did not use much steroids. I used a bunch of stuff like bag balm and mom steroidal ointments and creams along with bandaging, rubber bands for area itch, and some bathing. I am thinking that is maybe the reason that it take me about 2 months to work out of a flare-up.\nThis may sound like a contradiction, but if I have a serious flare-up skin is thin. My usual is not thin. Anyway, skin is not thin, at least for now. Skin is the dry type and is leathery at the joints, (lucky me), rather than thin.My hands have always looked wrinkled, like someone 50 and over. Finally now that I am 50, my hands have reached my age. Wayne 8.4/10\nDate: Sun, 4 Feb 1996 22:21:24 EST From: Gilbert Subject: Re: Thin Skin\nHi, Shelly, Kris, and all.\nSince several of you have mentioned problems with \"thin skin\" and are making the association between it and eczema, I'd like to put in here that one of the many problems associated with long-term use of cortisones (hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone, etc.) is not only thinning skin but also a breakdown in collagen as well as alteration in the behavior of our blood platelets (thrombocytes). The bruising (ecchymoses) makes me wonder again about steroid use over extended time. Also, because cortisones cause a degradation of collagen, the thin skin needs to be thought of as possibly part of the same picture presented by others in the forum who've commented on general breakdown of integument, including the venous blood-rich dermal layer under the surface skin (epidermis) as well as some muscle breakdown (atrophy). It's collagen which cements all these components into a three-dimensional functional structure. Loss of collagen is another part of the \"thinning\" process: three-dimension: two-dimension -- you get the idea.\nI am not claiming that all incidents of these symptoms are cortisone related. I am merely reminding of the fact that these are \"expected\" outcomes of long-term cortisone \"therapy.\"\nPS: Is it possible that the high frequency of complaints re: telangiectasias (spider-web-thin enlargements with or without hemorrhages in the tiny veins (venules) of the dermal skin layer of the face might just possibly be \"more\" a result of cortisone use (over time!) than of any direct or even indirect effects of \"eczema?\" After all, eczema is itself not the only culprit in this \"can of worms.\" We all know the old saw about which is worse, the disease or its treatments. . .\nPS #2: The bruising phenomenon should not be confused with the issue of coagulation in the context of clotting time. These have more to do with separate \"clotting factors\" in the blood. The platelets -- they get fragile (outright friable!) -- affected by cortisones present to the eye the appearance of either tiny red specks under the skin (petechiae, i.e., tiny single hemorrhaged venules) or as telangiectasias (that is, they hemorrhage or enlarge [engorge] in line with the direction of the venule) or, finally, as larger surface bruised areas (ecchymoses).\nThe combination of thinned skin, compromised dermis and diminished muscle mass secondary to collagen loss, as well as steroid-dependant determinants which discourage new tissue growth and healing add up and account for some of the problems getting aired on the forum.\nDate: Mon, 5 Feb 1996 13:29:19 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: Ann\nHi Ann! I'm so glad you finally made it on-line. To everyone else: Ann is one of the first people who contacted me after reading my May 1992 letter that said I was desperate to talk to someone else who'd had severe eczema.

I never attributed that to the eczema--I knew it was the cortisone use. I think the thinned out skin on my face is what makes my face so susceptible to infection and any \"foreign\" substance I inadvertently expose it to. But I'm more interested in the idea of the platelets become friable!! That scares me a lot. I know what it means for the skin to be friable; it's the necrotic skin of death even while one is alive. Are you talking about the platelets of both the RBCs and the WBCs? If the platelets crumble within the blood cells, does that bode ill for specific diseases like leukemia or something?\nAnd with destruction of the collagen and subsequent diminished muscle mass, over time can one expect to lose ambulatory status or use of limbs?\nDate: Mon, 5 Feb 1996 14:28:51 -0500 From: Jack Subject: Re: Death\nShelley, Nadia has also spoken about death, like \"why don't I just put an end to my misery and kill myself?\". Naturally, Tamara and I are most worried when we hear that kind of talk, given so much nihilistic thinking amongst teenagers these days. (Nadia IS only 10, mind you.)\nI think we've been fairly successful in dealing with this hopelessness; we haven't heard death wishes in a while. However, Nadia still generally ignores her bone dry or leathery skin as a way of avoiding the acceptance of her state. And, given that she has had very few infections and has not ripped herself up badly, we prefer a more peaceful home over the constant nagging that would be needed to get her to pay more attention to moisturizing.\nDate: Mon, 5 Feb 1996 22:35:57 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Steroids vs. Collagen\nWhen I use topical steriods a lot, my skin seems to become quite friable. When things are like that, I will sometimes lose a little tiny chunk of skin if I accidentally scrape my hand against something hard.\nThat certainly fits in with the collagen connection. Without collagen I think our bodies would be no more cohesive than a raw steak. We would literally fall apart, except for the bones, of course, and they probably are made of collagen too (I'm guessing) before they mineralize.\nThat's why I try to avoid steriods except when I see no practical alternative. At this point I use Diprolene only about 4 or 5 days a month, at a guess.\nDate: Mon, 5 Feb 1996 22:46:22 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Dire Consequences? I don't think so.\nKristen, I'm not answering for Gil, who obviously knows much more about this than I do, but I think platelets are a separate type of blood cell, not inside RBCs or WBCs. Correct me if I'm wrong, someone.\nAnd I very much doubt that leukemia or anything similar is a consequence of our problems or our use of steriods. Things may be bad, but not THAT bad!\n>> And with destruction of the collagen and subsequent diminished muscle mass, over time can one expect to lose ambulatory status or use of limbs? <<\nAgain, I would personally be very surprised if that were true. Not that I'm an expert, but I never heard of any such result. I think we're just doomed to keep on itching and scratching and sometimes to feel quite miserable, but not to become disabled or life-threateningly ill.\nDate: Mon, 5 Feb 1996 22:46:32 EST From: Gilbert Subject: Re: Thin Skin\nHi, Kristen. Increased susceptibility to infection is even more related to decreased immune function if we're still talking in the context of cortisone therapies. All the same, a thinner skin will be weaker and more susceptible to abrasions, tares and shearing-force types of injury.\nI need to be clearer about the contextual damage to platelets (thrombocytes). I rather regret using the term \"friable\" -- the problem that overuse of steroids (glucocorticosteroids such as the cortisones) entrains has nothing to do with necrotizing skin, so that fear seems unwarranted. Also, while trying to be clear on this point, I'll mention that there is no such entity as \"platelets of both the RBCs and the WBCs.\" Platelets are a discrete species of corpuscles, not quite cells, in fact. They serve several known functions, one of which is to plug up torn or severed blood vessels. Cortisones cause a decrease in number and efficiency of circulating platelets. Having fewer platelets (thrombocytopenia) means that broken blood vessels don't get patched and closed as effectively as they ought to. Minor hemorrhages such as I mentioned in my letter yesterday will result. Platelets also play various roles in signaling immune cells to \"come to task.\" So, diminished numbers of platelets add to a reduced immune surveillance.\nAlso, there is no association here with immune cell diseases such as the leukemias. The frequent low platelet count found with those diseases is due to other pathological causes.\n>> And with destruction of the collagen and subsequent diminished muscle mass, pver time can one expect to lose ambulatory status or use of limbs? <<\nNo. The most \"extreme\" I could imagine would be an expected sort of scenario where someone has such a reduced immunocompetence that \"if\" s(he) incurs an injury to the integument, it might not heal. If an immortal wound is allowed to get worse, to get infected, etc., then the condition could, of course, result in gross damage. If the damage is so extensive and threatens to keep extending in size, depth, etc., then \"lose of . . .\" might be a real occasion. But then, here, we're talking about unbridled infection. For all that, I can't help but remind that \"unbridled\" suggests that the wound was not or could not be contained. Containment is the primary function of the \"unpleasant\" phenomenon we call \"inflammation.\" Inflammation seeks to \"wall off\" injured areas so they do not spread. Then, in confinement, the injured area can be dealt with discretely by our protective mechanisms (i.e., the immune system, etc.).\nDate: Tue, 6 Feb 1996 13:37:27 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: thin skin\nGil, I really appreciate your insights and ability to tie together all the symptoms and come up with the common cause. I agree that the long-term use of steroids and cortisone is the culprit, not the eczema. If people can manage to live without those drugs, they should do it. When you're a child, your parents make these decisions for you, and you have no choice in the matter. As with all drugs, if you're going to take them, you should be an adult who can give informed consent, willing to take the risk of the side effects. As for myself, I have no regrets. I've been in such agony so many times that without that medication I would have either committed suicide or gone berserk and landed in a mental institution. The point is that it must be used as a last resort. People should try everything else first, like Wren is doing, but when you're desperate, it's worth it. Of course, I'm only 39. Ask me again in 20 or 30 years after further damage is assessed...\nDate: Tue, 6 Feb 1996 15:02:25 -0800 From: Ann Subject: misc. comments\nWayne, how do you use rubber bands to control itching? I am learning so much already. I had never heard or used the word \"friable\" before I got online!\nLadies, I have the idea that we eczema women use steroids more readily that the men. I confess to often using the stuff for cosmetic reasons. Whereas the men I've encountered with skin problems like mine seem to only use drugs for itch control. I wonder if anyone has done a study on this. Now that I am close to 50, I do anything I can to avoid a red face, because someone always seems to point at me and shout \"HOT FLASH!\" (half joking)\nI have learned to not apply cortisone right after a scratching frenzy. If I wait a few hours (maybe overnight), it's easier to zero in on the really bad area and I can avoid zapping areas that were only temporarily red from the scratching. Also, I like to use Eucerin cream as a moisturizer because its white color tones down the red. Whereas, the vaseline seemed to highlight it. The psychological boost I get is worth the 5 fold price difference, I guess.\nI also have sinus trouble. When my sinuses get bad, the skin gets better and visa versa. When I have a fever, my skin clears completely. Does anyone else experience this? My allergist thinks this is unusual.\nMy current passion is to get Elocon and other potent skin meds in a stick form. It would be much easier to apply sparingly without zapping the fingers each time. If anyone is out there from the drug companies, please push this idea through your R&D dept. fast!\nDate: Tue, 6 Feb 1996 22:34:12 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Re: sinus trouble and eczema\nAnn, I have made the same observation, and have even mentioned it here on the list. It puzzles me. It's almost as if my immune system needs to be fighting *something* all the time. When it's busy with a real illness, it doesn't bother with my skin, so my skin gets better.\nI guess that's a ridiculous theory, but it's the only one I can think of.\nDate: Wed, 7 Feb 1996 01:24:43 EST From: Gilbert Subject: Re: thin skin\nYou said it! You said it! \"As a last resort. . .,\" seems to sum up the cortisone thread in four words!\nDate: Wed, 7 Feb 1996 01:24:39 EST From: Gilbert Subject: Dire Consequences? I don\nJust a couple more comments re: platelets and the issue raised regarding possible loss of mobility:\nI gave the \"no\" answer to the issue of loss of mobility because the context was \"over time.\" In other words, even long-term steroid use with all its decrements does not cause ambulatory loss. OK, every global statement probably has its exceptions. Here, there is one exception. Acute muscle weakness (myopathy) can result from massive acute systemic cortisone administration. I did not mention it before because it simply doesn't apply to our situation with eczema in this forum. So, there is an exception to the rule, but it would take a context such as massive chemotherapy (that's an example) to bring on such a myopathy. Even then, it is reversible with cessation of steroid treatment, though it usually takes a couple months to reverse out the myopathy. I'm mentioning this only to be complete. This scenario does not apply to eczema or other atopias.\nAnd, finally, just a note to clarify the query about what platelets are and aren't. Technically, platelets are not cells. Since they are not, we don't call them cells but give them the name, corpuscles. And here's why and what the distinction's about:\nWhite blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets (i.e., all the constituents of what we normally think of as blood \"cells\") derive from a common ancestor stem cell in the bone marrow. This marrow stem cell is acted on by physiological determinants (ex. micro-hormones, enzymes, etc..) which shape its destiny. If we use the analogy of a tree whose trunk is the stem cell, then we can trace the course of development which it will take. Some stem cells are acted on so that they become red blood cells, others are acted on differently and become white blood cells. Think of these as large branches stemming off the stem-cell trunk. This process of development is called differentiation. The particular destiny of the cell in question is termed it's \"path of commitment.\"\nJust one step further and we can appreciate that even these branches will further differentiate and commit themselves (i.e., be committed) to even more specialization through differentiation. Therefore, some white blood cells are \"lymphocytes,\" others are \"neutrophils.\" And, this story goes on and on. Following this same analogy, the diversity is just as rich and rewarding in the branches of RBCs. For example, the RBCs which produce IgE are one generation from their \"parent\" generic RBC.\nAnd, finally, there are platelets: These entities are servants in attendance to more complex blood cells such as RBCs and WBCs. Platelets don't need to possess \"intelligence.\" Therefore, they derive from the common stem cell by extruding their nucleus along with other organelles associated with complex interactive decision=making obligations. Because these erstwhile \"cells\" have extruded a number of intracellular regulatory components, they no longer possess the \"relative\" independence we necessarily associate with what we call a cell.\nWell then, what are corpuscles (i.e., platelets)? They are globs of cohesive, interactive enzymes which can be \"called to task\" by WBCs. A WBC will, for instance, issue an instruction -- and notice that this requires \"intelligence,\" hence a nucleus with DNA and RNA which enable it to live and multiply, to repair itself and to manufacture environmentally significant products -- and the \"dumb\" platelet will be the chemically active glob which will \"respond\" by turning over its chemical reactions into product of one description or another. It should come as no surprise that platelets don't last very long -- they don't have the where-with-all to reproduce. They serve and desist.\nThe topic is complex but interesting. I don't think it's germane to our forum interests, however.\nMy purpose, therefore, is merely to \"try\" to clarify some physiology so that there aren't misunderstandings. Sorry for playing professor.\nDate: Wed, 7 Feb 1996 09:56:17 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Immune system\nGil, Do you know if much can be done to rebuild a depressed immune system? I've used cortisone consistently nearly every night for the last 36 years. Based on what you've just explained, some of us are classical cortisone junkies with long histories that will never be reversed. What does this bode for skin problems when one is (lovely word, this) elderly?\nDate: Mon, 5 Feb 1996 18:22:13 From: Wayne Subject: Kids and AD, Chinese Herbal Tea\nJack and the AD community: The Chinese Herbal Tea I am taking IS from the Washington Hospital Center, Dr Fountain is one of my dermatologists. Too bad you are not in the UK where the CHT formula is in pill form and available on restricted prescription. I heard that these pills may be available in Canada, by prescription. I don't know if you have any contacts up north.\nIt is always painful to hear a story like Nadia's...she will find out that we can make it. But a pre-teen doesn't want to hear that; that is why your idea of her just meeting someone her age would help. \"Kids with AD\" is a forceful affinity group, just as \"Parents with infants/children with AD\". Maybe soon, as we develop online the kids can get together during the spring or the summer. Some of you already know, I was 45 before had a meaningful conversation with another person who had AD. I think that that is part of the reason we are here; to learn what we do not know, and also to make it better for the young people with AD. Wayne 8.4+/10\nDate: Wed, 7 Feb 1996 13:49:57 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: Nadia\nJack and Tamara: Re Nadia's talk of death, I think that's a normal reaction given her condition. I really applaud your efforts to find other kids with eczema for her to talk to. I wish my parents had made such efforts. It's true that you can't understand in the way she needs to be understood, by her peers. I wouldn't worry too much about her lack of moisturizer use. If she's comfortable enough to do without it, she's OK. Eventually she'll learn to take care of herself and figure out what she needs to do to feel better. All you may be able to do is to react matter-of-factly to her talk of death with a sincere response like \"I know it must feel awful honey, and I wish with all my heart it was within my power to make it go away. But I'm as frustrated as you are. It makes me so angry to see you suffer and feel helpless to make you feel better. But as you get older it's probably going to be easier than it is now, and I hope you can hang in there long enough to see what life is like when your skin is better. There are lots of other people who suffered through this just like you're doing and they wished they could die sometimes too. Remember that woman Shelley that you met? She felt the same way when she was your age. There were times when she just couldn't take it anymore. Many nights when she cried and screamed and tossed and turned for hours and hours all night long. And days too. But she got mad that this bad skin was making her want to die, and she told herself that she wanted to be tough enough and strong enough to keep living till her skin got better. And she did! And so did lots of other people. And I know you can do it too because you're really strong inside the way you need to be to do that. And I hope I live long enough to see your skin better too.\" Then just hold her in your arms and maybe for a little while she won't feel so bad.\nDate: Wed, 7 Feb 1996 17:34:09 EST From: Gilbert Subject: Immune system\nHi, Kris: I'll reply more specifically to your letter in a couple days. For the time being, let's remember, though, that much of the potential damage we might associate with long-term (and usually high-dose) steroids centers more on structural deficits such as loss of tissue integrity. Compromise of the immune system associated with steroid therapies is far more likely short-term and reversible -- at least in the reasonable context of our discussion. So, immunological questions could arise such as \"do wounds heal as they ought to?\"\nDate: Wed, 7 Feb 1996 17:26:19 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: This & That\nSpeaking of spicy foods, I avoid them like the plague, Wayne. I end up coughing, sneezing, and choking, while my eyes run like a sieve and so does my nose. I had never experienced sweating until I reached \"change of life.\" That's another joy. As you probably know, sweating creates itch even if one never had it before. It means numerous showers, when possible, and air conditioning--the biggest necessity of all.\nIf I asked my Dr., would she be able to prescribe the Chinese herb tea pills here in Wisconsin? I belong to an HMO--a mixed blessing at best.\nDate: Wed, 7 Feb 1996 17:39:00 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: Steroids vs. Collagen\nRalph, I envy you your reduced need for cortisone. If you have ever had eczema literally from your scalp down to your ankles, you would do anything for deliverance. Cortisone is the only med that allowed me to actually function like most people, rather than hurt at every move I made. I don't regret its use, even if it kills me.\nDate: Wed, 7 Feb 1996 17:44:24 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: Dire Consequences? I don't think so.\nRalph, When I read one of the last issues of the AD newsletter, several pages recounted others' experiences from a poll they had taken. Most of other people's experiences were the same as mine; emotionally, it is devastating to feel like a freak, especially when one is young. For girls, it is even harder because our culture judges females on our looks 99%. It's only a slight bonus if we happen to have a few brains along with our looks. It's also a lot easier for males to cover up their derm defects.\nThe poll also mentioned how much time is lost from work because of AD. I remember being sick with skin problems for weeks at a time. I was too much of a mess to be out in public, not to mention it is impossible to doctor the problem unless one is at home with all the bottles and creams and lotions and a bathtub. I'd trade you the hand bubbles anytime!!\nDate: Wed, 7 Feb 1996 17:56:24 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: misc. comments\nHi Ann--so true. We women have to have attractive faces, or our worth is questionable. If we don't look pretty (and it's pretty tough if one has facial eczema to look pretty), we'll never attract a husband. Horrors and Ruination!\nUntil I was 18, I used to have constant inflammation above the upper lip--I died a thousand deaths. I wanted to go around with my head in a bag. And cortisone let me lead a normal existence for nearly 20 years--it was worth it. The biggest detraction I've run into is arrogant doctors who with all their erudition are so sure we, the person inside the skin, couldn't possibly have enough brains to understand our own condition or the dangers of cortisone. Their brush off's still make me see red!\nThe inflammation is a huge embarrassment. I've also had such tremendous heat, I swore I was burning up inside myself. Of course, I know now that the heat was the price for cortisone overuse.\nNever heard of Elocon? What is it?\nI haven't gone through wet wrapping since I was about 10. Incapacity is a better description. I think I get much the same effect with a soaking bath or a long cooling shower. Wrapping sounds like a hemongous time-consumer, probably with short-term effects. Or do you recommend it? Do you tolerate skin-skin contact well? I can't bear to \"stick\" to anybody else's skin!\nDate: Wed, 7 Feb 1996 17:35:57 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: Skin after 50 years\nWayne, I've never heard of bag balm? What is it? I admire your willingness to wait two months to get over an exacerbation. I no longer have any tolerance for derm crises. The misery just isn't worth it to me. Better I live a shorter life than a longer one in agony.\nDate: Thu, 8 Feb 1996 13:41:24 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: Eczema book\nI just found a 1994 book called The Natural Way with Eczema by Sheena Meredith, published by Element, Inc. in Rockport, MA. It's a $5.95 paperback that claims to be \"a comprehensive guide\" to alternative treatments. I wouldn't call it comprehensive but it does give a certain amount of basic info about a wide variety of holistic treatments including EPO, herbs, acupuncture, reflexology, etc. Criticism: The Chinese herbal tea mixture of ten herbs is mentioned, but the ten herbs are not identified. The coverage of Western medicine is poor, especially the statement \"Unlike some other chronic ailments, conventional medicine has a pretty good understanding of the causes of eczema, does take account of how it is affected by lifestyle, personality and stress, and can usually effectively alleviate its symptoms.\" If that was true, the book wouldn't be necessary! Anyway, it's the first book specifically on eczema that I've seen currently in print in the U.S. I found it at Barnes and Noble bookstore.\nDate: Thu, 8 Feb 1996 13:41:33 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: Ann's misc. comments\nAnn, we are interested in hearing whatever you can tell us about recent treatments you've used. A lot of valuable material has already been come up, but so far not much on wet wrapping and allergy shots. Do tell us whatever you know about that. As for Elocon in a stick form, that's a great idea and the kind of thing that EASE should be involved in promoting, since I've gotten the impression that they are in bed with the drug companies. Perhaps Wayne can mention this at the upcoming meeting this Sunday. The only problem I can see is that the consistency of the cream would have to be different to harden it into a stick. Wouldn't that require research to figure out how make it fit the package and still maintain the effectiveness of the cream? I'm sure there's a way to do it. I really like the \"roll-on\" no greasy hands style applicator of Cleocin-T antibacterial liquid that I use. But that's a liquid so there's no comparison...\nDate: Thu, 8 Feb 1996 21:04:36 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Re: Dire Consequences? I don't think so.\n>> For girls, it is even harder because our culture judges females on our looks 99%. <<\nI hadn't thought of it that way. I can see how that might be more difficult for a woman. However, I recently heard about a young man (17, I think) with eczema on just his hands, from his mother. She said he was becoming depressed and reclusive because of the problem, and wouldn't socialize or date because he felt self-conscious about his problem.\nBTW, I don't get \"bubbles\" on my hands, just intense itching, scaling, and cracks across my fingers. It can be quite painful at times.\nActually, I realize that I misused the word \"disabling\" in my previous message. I meant to say that eczema would not lead to bone degeneration, or (to my knowledge) cause a person to be unable to walk, or bedridden, or confined to a wheelchair. But your message shows that eczema can be disabling in other ways. I stand corrected.\nDate: Fri, 9 Feb 1996 11:17:24 -0800 From: Ann Subject: reply to Kristen and Shelley\nWow, I've spent almost a lifetime thinking I was the only person who indulged in recreational scratching, who experienced orgasmic scratching, and who often itched but couldn't pinpoint where I itched!\nMy respiratory problems are much better with allergy shots. I also use various antihistamines, and , of course, nasal steroids. When I'm not slathering it on my skin, I'm snuffing it up my nostrils; I am a true steroid junkie! Also, I do saline nasal washes. The nurses on the National Jewish Lung Line are wonderful about telling you how to do it most effectively. They also got me going on the wet wrapping. If anyone has the time, money and motivation, National Jewish has great derm and allergy depts. They will take you and completely analyze your immune system. I think it takes about a week.\nYes the wet wrapping can be an extremely time consuming, life altering activity. When I did it every night all over, it was the only way I could sleep. The wet cloth felt so much better than dry cloth or than skin ( like where my legs would rub together). It also made the skin more resilient, less powdery, less friable. Alas, the rash and inflamation were still there.\nElocon is a potent steroid type ointment. I think it would work in stick form in the same way that a chapstick can be vaseline based. It would still go on greasy, it would just be easier to spread real thinly. I don't use any cream forms of meds. The greasier the better as far as I am concerned; my derm doctor agrees with me on this.\nAllergy shots have been my salvation. I guess it could be placebo effect or just coincidence? It took over a year before I really started improving; and at first I went downhill with some really bad flares. I'm still pretty much covered, but the rash is so much less dramatic. Now a flare is pink; it used to be deep, deep oozing burgundy. Sinuses are better too. The shots only are appropriate for people who test positive to pollen and dust allergies. Finding enough intact skin to test is a challenge for eczema patients. My hives were mostly 6s and 7s on a scale of 0 to 4, so I looked like a good candidate.\nI also have global food allergies. But since I am underweight, my doctor doesn't advise cutting out any more foods. except, of course, the ones that throw me into anaphalaxis! Once I get to the maximum strength on the shots (probably another year; this isn't for impatient patients), I'll experiment with food.\nDate: Fri, 9 Feb 1996 11:29:16 -0800 From: Ann Subject: REPLY TO RALPH immune issues\nYes, that is exactly how it seems to me too; my immune system needs to be busy all the time. I wonder if it would be possible to develop a placebo type vaccine to work on this.\nI also have the feeling that there are two types of eczema. People like me have basically normal skin; but the immune system is out of whack with the skin simply the target organ. Other people have skin that is deficient or super sensitive itself. I don't know if this makes sense, but my allergist sort of implied this. Anyone have any comments?\nSpeaking of immune systems, I confess to having a very politically uncorrect AIDS phobia. I feel that my broken skin makes me an easy mark for the virus. I believe that I COULD \"get it from a handshake or a kiss.\" Any body else feel the same?\nDate: Fri, 9 Feb 1996 17:57:34 EST From: Wayne Subject: Responses to...\nAnn: I use the thick rubber bands (like the post office uses to bundle junk mail delivered) to put over limbs which have just been scratched in response to orgasmic itch. I find that with orgasmic itch I will scratch until things are pretty well torn up if I don't be careful. Watching the damage I'm doing helps (idea from Shelley), so I stop scratching and put these rubber bands over affected limbs, over some nice cotton pants or shirt. This helps hold back the invitation to scratch on. I think what happens is that the pressure of the rubber bands pushes back some of the blood/fluids that heat up the itch. Also, the rubber bands cause sharp pressure which substitutes for the destructive action of scraping nails. You won't find this method in the Merck manual.\nKristen: Unless you have the formula that works and a well stocked Chinese herbal shop nearby you are out of luck. Quality control of the stuff in a critical issue. The formula that works for a particular type of AD (chronic, refractory, dry, affecting all parts of body, and other I don't know of...)has been mashed into a pill in the UK. So you can go to the UK and have it prescribed. Maybe you can get it in Canada, I don't know.As far as I know the only active FDA/US approved CHT study is at the Washington Hospital Center. They are running out of supplies. Another hospital in the Pittsburgh area is seeking FDA approval to conduct trials on CHT.\nBag Balm. Some psoriasis friends told me they use it. It is an antiseptic that farmers use on cow after milking them. You can get the stuff at any local feed store. I use it as an antiseptic and also emollient for certain kinds (dry, brittle, oozing) of skin.\nShelley: Thanks for the rest of the story on Andrew in the park.\nAlong with Shelley's regional eczema conventions, and those who were talking about a spa, I add that we need a National Eczema Retreat where we can get all kinds of treatment, talk, read and aligh life. Wayne 8.5/10\nDate: Fri, 9 Feb 1996 16:52:27 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: Responses to...\nWow--lots of stuff to ponder, Wayne. The bag balm sounds interesting. Any idea what is in it? Like Ann, I need the greasy based stuff.\nRubberband \"therapy\" sounds intriguing--it is true that some sharp pain does get one past the itch sensation. I used to take scalding showers for that reason. The rubberband idea is certainly more benign.\nA retreat would be a neat idea. Putting it together would be a real job, and where would we have it? We AD people are all over the globe!\nDate: Fri, 9 Feb 1996 17:09:24 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: Dire Consequences? I don't think so.\nI regret using the term \"bubbles.\" I thought you had mentioned getting the little blisters that have fluid inside them. Certainly didn't mean to minimize your bouts with AD--I do agree that scaling and cracks in the fingers can be nasty little miseries, and very disconcerting. I keep my fingernails cut back to the quick, so at least when I do itch, I can't do terrible damage. But I've used a hairbrush in the past to do the job when nothing else worked.\nIt's too easy for all of us to assume that AD isn't life-threatening. It can be emotionally devastating, so much that it incapacitates one via depression. My friends always used to tell me they didn't notice anything, but they had no inkling how bad I felt--it's having this terrible imperfection that one must hide at all costs, on top of feeling utterly miserable at every move. Of course, I wanted to look like everybody else, and I must have succeeded quite well. But when it becomes impossible to be out in public, at work or school, there is no denying its virulence. I remember refusing to answer a knock at my door because I couldn't bear to have anyone see me. Of course, the party knew I was home, so I yelled through the door that I was \"indisposed.\" How's that for a put off? haha\nBut Shelley's account of some people she knows giving up hope is really heart-rending. As an adult, I cope much better psychologically--partly because I don't give a d--- what people think anymore. Unless I am so red-faced I feel like I'm going up in flames (literally)! Eczema can make one want to stay in a closet for life.\nJust because someone doesn't look sick doesn't mean they don't have an acute and/or chronic problem. I think our culture is much too quick to judge based on outward appearances alone. Guess that makes us something of a plastic society for most intent and purposes.\nDo you feel embarrassed by the condition of your hands? Do people ever stare and ask you what is your problem? And do you feel like explaining it in public, when they do ask? Or do they seem genuinely interested in your problem?\nDate: Fri, 9 Feb 1996 17:32:22 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: REPLY TO RALPH immune issues\nAnn, I'm not sure how you differentiate between one and the other. Cortisone use has made me more susceptible to sunlight, heat, humidity and sweating that I tolerated fairly well when I was younger and had never used it. So I now have acutely sensitive skin. I'm not sure how one can tell if it's an immune-based problem or just sensitive skin?\nIt's true having broken skin makes one more susceptible; I was refused admission to nursing school at 19 because of it. They said I'd never make it through surgery--hands were a mess. Guess it was an impractical ambition--in retrospect. At the time I felt utterly destroyed. I know the paper company at home wouldn't consider hiring me because of the eczema. They produced Kotex, Kleenex, etc., in a sterile environment, and I was a risk--probably both ways! I think you are correct about exposing yourself to any virus--true for all of us, no doubt. Altho I've read that saliva and the skin do not pass the virus on. It has to be blood or other internal body fluids. Broken skin would make you a bad recipient for sure, though. For me, the eczema has become an excuse to withdraw physically from people.\nDate: Fri, 9 Feb 1996 17:36:03 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: misc responses\nThese are sad stories, Shelley. I can relate to the despair they felt. We women are judged on our looks, but men with the problem don't have the support system women usually can build to help them through.\nDate: Fri, 9 Feb 1996 17:41:35 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Other AD people\nSpeaking of eczema community, I never knew it existed either before I found this online group. None of the multitude of doctors I saw for years (all men) ever thought to put me in touch with other AD persons. I had never ever found anyone with the same problem even in my family--it runs on my dad's side. Everyone else had all \"outgrown\" it--I was the martyr in the family it seemed. So this is fantastic to talk to all of you about a mutual problem and KNOW that you all can relate 100 percent!\nDate: Fri, 9 Feb 1996 20:33:06 EST From: Gilbert Subject: Fears\nHi, Ann. Forget whether a fear is \"politically\" correct or not <g>. You correctly use the word \"phobia\" to identify an irrational fear. As a health officer in the field of infectious disease I engage in both clinical and research areas of immuno(in)competence and, especially, AIDS. Professionally (and therefore personally), I do not worry about possible contact contamination such as a handshake, a kiss -- casual social gestures -- in the context of the HIV virus.\nUnfortunately, I cannot say the same when it comes to Staph infections (there are too many to list here) and a number of other *bacterial* agents which can present problems to folks with open skin lesions. If I had a penny for everyone who's had to pay dearly for infections gotten from casual-contact *bacterial* contamination, I'd be wealthy. If I had a fortune for demonstrating a case of casual-contact infection from AIDS, I'd remain penniless for it.\nFor what it's worth saliva is antimicrobial to HIV. An open skin contact would need to be a compression lock against blood-exposing skin from someone with HIV -- and it would require some \"time\" to enable viral transfer. We do know of two cases where this was likely. The scenarios were in hospital where nurses used their unprotected hands (their hands had open and bleeding lesions) to compress bloody wounds on patients infected with HIV. This is not casual contact, it's outright forceful blood-to-blood impregnation and is indistinguishable from other impregnations such as the sharing of \"dirty needles.\"\nPeople with open skin lesions feel vulnerable to both the facts of infection and to the idea of infection. Facts and ideas don't always match, however.\nDate: Mon, 12 Feb 1996 08:46:30 EST From: Tyrone Subject: Skin Discoloration\nMy daughter has eczema on her arms and legs. The skin in these regions has become discolored. We live in the Northeast and her body is always covered, at least this time of year. What would you suggest to help her skin return to its normal color? I was hoping that with summer, her limbs would be exposed to sunlight which would help the healing process.\nI admire you all in being so proactive in your own care.\nDate: Mon, 12 Feb 1996 08:51:27 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: Skin Discoloration\nHi Tyrone, You mean her skin is mottled appearing?

Kris\nDate: Mon, 12 Feb 1996 10:48:06 PST From: Wren Subject: Re: Skin Discoloration\nHi Tyrone, My skin has become a slight reddish brown on all parts of my body where I itch, which is nearly everywhere. I only have a couple of small yellowish patches left. Periodically I get complimented on my tan or looking healthy from being out in the sun. I either reply \"thank you\" or explain that I have a skin condition that makes my skin look this way. I 'm hoping that as my condition improves the red-brown will revert to my God-given olive white-yellow color.\nI don't see it so much as proactive, as fighting for the return of my former healthy skin. I want it back, damn it.\nDate: Mon, 12 Feb 1996 15:21:12 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Re: immune issues\n>> I also have the feeling that there are two types of eczema. People like me have basically normal skin; but the immune system is out of whack with the skin simply the target organ. <<\nI was beginning to wonder about that possibility myself. I am such an allergic person, and my eczema gets better when I'm away from dust and pollen, and much worse during bad allergy times. But evidently that is not true for everyone with eczema. Surprising and interesting. Maybe eczema is more than one disease.\nOver this past weekend I tagged along at a conference about managed care. Also attending was an allergist who told me that there are two immune systems in the body: the humoral, or IgE immune system and the cell-mediated immunity system. (I think I'm getting those terms mostly right.) People with allergies have IgE problems, while people with eczema are having trouble with their cell-mediated immune systems.\nHe said that \"infiltrates\" of certain kinds of immune cells (I didn't catch the name) actually get into the skin tissue and cause the itching. These cells also supposedly interact with Staphyloccus (sp?) organisms, which may explain why antibiotics are frequently helpful.\nDate: Mon, 12 Feb 1996 15:30:47 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Re: Dire Consequences? I don't think so.\nSometimes people notice and mention my hands. Of course, they certainly might notice and not mention it too, but I wouldn't know about that. Yeah, it's embarrassing at times. I sort of hide my hands to some extent when the eczema is cracked, bleeding, oozing, etc. I even tried wearing white gloves for a while, but people REALLY stared at those, and asked a lot of questions, so that was no good.\nSome other people do seem interested and concerned in a nice way. I think the interested ones either have a similar problem or know someone who does.\nTo be honest, I wish I could just stop thinking about eczema and allergies. I get tired of it all. And I know that my problem is about one tenth as bad as that of many others on this list.\nDate: Mon, 12 Feb 1996 16:28:17 -0800 From: Ann Subject: eczema's effect on work\nKristen's story of missing out on two careers really hit home. I had interests in science, but my first dissection was my last, due I guess to the formaldehyde on my hands. More damaging to me, though, has been my view of myself as a person who can not due many ordinary things. I was rashy from the age of 3 months on, almost died at 15 months from a massive herpes skin infection ( I still get them everywhere), never could crawl on carpet or grass, never could pull taffy or do crafts, needed a special cloth on my chair at school because my rashy legs stuck to the shellac (this was before girls could wear pants) etc. , I still consider myself to be an underachiever, quite possibly because of all the things I couldn't do in my formative years because of my skin and the feeling that I was fragile.\nI was always glad I wasn't a boy because I was sure I would have been labelled a sissy. My motor skills developed very late and slowly (my handwriting is still strange); I think this was due to my not doing a lot of normal childhood things ( no crawling, no clay etc.) What I'm trying to say is that while Kristen heard \"you can't do what you want to do\" from the Nursing School people, I (and probably a lot of us) heard the same message from our parents and our own egos from day one. But because it was \"just a skin\" problem , we missed out on whatever counseling was available for those with more serious handicaps.\nDate: Tue, 13 Feb 1996 16:39:46 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Re: FAQ Addition ?\nI am intrigued by the idea of trapping moisture. My own experience has not pointed in that direction, but I will try this technique and report back on it. I can't say that dryness is my major worry most of the time -- rather it's the itching, as well as pain and sensitivity from cracking, that bother me.\nDate: Tue, 13 Feb 1996 16:56:59 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: eczema's effect on work\nVery interesting, Ann, what parallels we AD people seem to have.

I no absolutely no patience with health care professionals or healthcare systems that give me the runaround, and I am very verbal about it, too! Not a popularity contest anyway, but I refuse to put up with the bad treatment I always just accepted, because \"that's the way things are.\" Balderdash!!!\nAnd, What ego? My life has been mostly put-down city--until I got tired of it all and just started fighting back. People don't generally appreciate feistiness, but it was get feisty or be a complete doormat my entire life.\n>> But because it was \"just a skin\" problem , we missed out on whatever counseling was available for those with more serious handicaps. <<\nYeah--you can say that again. AD couldn't be very serious--you can still walk, talk, run--do everything everybody else does. The price we all pay is invisible (for the most part) to others, and we collude in this impression by minimizing our own problems. I firmly believe that the psychological price we pay for this disease is at least as high as the physical price.\nDate: Tue, 13 Feb 1996 17:43:16 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: Dire Consequences? I don't think so.\nI appreciate the embarrassing hands scenario--I keep my hands out of the way because of my embarrassingly cutback nails. Makes the fingers look stubby in this era of long, tapering fingers with long red-painted nail polish!\nI sure appreciate your feeling about \"tired of eczema\"--when it colors one's every thought, wish, and action. My friends think when I go into a slump, a few days will do it. I spend literally weeks and months crawling out of my physical and mental depression over the constant daily care, the wear and tear of it all. Ann mentioned being an underachiever--probably very true for many of us. We must devote a big chunk of our lives to the mean act of daily care, forsaking many really longterm goals. The eczema has always made me think twice about possible ventures I might pursue, with the consideration for personal care getting top priority and in hopes it won't be a conflict of interest. Cheers, Keep up the good fight, Ralph.\nDate: Wed, 14 Feb 1996 17:47:15 -0800 From: Ann Subject: Anger\nIt interests me to hear that other skin patients direct their anger at the medical profession. Myself, I've been fortunate to find doctors who aren't aloof and seem sincere in their attempt to help me. The fact that no one has found a cure or a safe treatment for eczema isn't our doctors' fault. I have to admit that if I were a healthy. wealthy person who wanted to donate billions to medical research, I wouldn't select a skin condition that has a low mortality rate and that often clears up or gets much better for long periods of time in many cases.\nAs for MY anger, it is directed at those non-allergic clear skin souls who offer me catty suggestions or make unkind comments. Once at a large gathering, one such person asked me, when we were seated at the table, if I knew that there was a big welt on my neck! On another occasion, her sister said that I had sinus trouble because I once had a nose job ( it was just to remove a knob on the very tip of the nose; no bone or sinus intervention was done). She, a \"mature\" woman, also told me it was disgusting that I did saline nasal washes. Their mother has remarked that if I ate a better diet, my skin would be clear and that it will be so interesting to see what happens to me at menopause! (am I her lab animal?) I also know someone who once had widespread eczema and is now completely clear, and has been for years, due to alternative medicine. She is also extremely successful and attractive and I think I feel envy (who wouldn't?) rather that anger at her.\nAnyhow, I think it's important for us to direct our anger outward - at doctors, unkind people etc. - rather than at our own skins.\nDate: Thu, 15 Feb 1996 12:02:13 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: skin discoloration\nTyrone: If you mean loss of pigment, I have that on my elbows, where there's a two-tone effect in patches where the skin is partly bone-white and partly my normal flesh color. I've also seen Alan's skin with loss of pigment in various places. I know there's a reason that you can lose the melanin coloring, but I don't remember what it is. I have had this loss of pigment ever since childhood, and I assume it is permanent. Perhaps Gil knows how this happens. Or do you mean some other discoloration?\nDate: Thu, 15 Feb 1996 12:02:48 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: FAQ\nDon't take recommendations as strict guidelines that MUST be followed. Suggestions are a place to start, and then you must experiment with your own reactions, adapting them to your own individual situation. Flexibility and patience are keys to managing this condition. Be aware that treatments seem to work for a period of time and then don't work anymore and you must figure out something new. But there are many approaches and you just have to try one after the one and eventually something will have a beneficial effect.\nDate: Thu, 15 Feb 1996 17:58:57 -0800 From: Ann Subject: eczema distracts from other probs.\nI just thought of a big problem I DO have with the medical profession, as well as my dentist and psychotherapist. If I go to a health professional for some other ailment, the eczema invariably gets more attention (because it's everywhere and so red and visable?). Once I was in the gynocological stirrups and the doctor exclaimed \"Wow, you are covered with this rash; from here, I can see that your legs are really bad!\" I had assumed that she was focusing on her area of expertise. But her comment made me wonder if I really got a thorough exam.\nAlso, for the past two or three years, I've had swollen lymph nodes ( groin and collar bone areas). The doctors say it's just a result of the constant skin and sinus inflamation. But I wonder if it could be something else that needs treatment. If a clear skinned person walked in with the same symptom, would they get a more extensive work up? Does anyone else with eczema out there have lymph node problems?\nDate: Fri, 16 Feb 1996 13:09:49 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: anger and lymph nodes\nAnn, I didn't mean to direct any anger at YOU for raising the issue about doctors. I didn't feel you were questioning my activism. Your comment simply became the hook that pulled up a bucket of rage from my bottomless pit. I'm going out of town for a couple of days (so everyone will get a brief respite from my daily comments) but before I go I wanted to mention that I also often get swollen lymph nodes in my groin. Doctors have said not to worry, it's just evidence of my body fighting off various infections.\nDate: Sat, 17 Feb 1996 22:07:45 EST From: Gilbert Subject: Re: writing the FAQ\nSince \"eczema\" can be a confusingly general term, distinctions are in order. For example, we will need to make sure our prospective reader does not confuse all eczema \"outbreaks\" as being one and the same as \"atopic eczema\" (i.e., atopic dermatitis). Also, in any discussions where cause->effect comes into play, we'll need to be clear about what we \"know\" and what we experience; signs and symptoms are not identical with disease entity -- yet they are \"inextricably\" bound up with evidentiary causation.\nThese are slippery slopes -- for lay people and for physicians; they're slippery for basic scientists as well: immunologists and bench scientists get confounded too. After all, not only are multiple factors at play. . . they're playing different games with different folk. The array of variables (situation, time; circumstance, environment) makes for confusion.\nWhile we're definitely dealing with physical forces (heredity; repetitive-use stress; environmental agents -- you name it!), there are psychological forces and \"tempers\" that confound clinician and patient alike.\nAnd even this business:\nWhich part of the immune system -- humoral? / cellular? -- is involved in this or that expression of the eczematous state is unfortunately not as tidy as simple assignments would suggest: Yes, eczema [if it's atopic dermatitis!] is -- as a lesion -- caused by the \"cellular\" branch of the immune system. The \"lesion\" we see is an inappropriate event of cellular immunity [technically called a \"delayed-type hypersensitivity response\"].\nFine, but then why is it that most people with \"atopic dermatitis\" also have problems with \"allergies\" and allergens? [that's the 'humoral' or antibody arm of the immune system -- the \"IgE\" connection, if you will].\nTo further the nomenclature, these \"allergies\" and \"asthma\" are examples of what two pathbreaking researchers by the names of Gell and Coombs termed \"Type I Hypersensitivity\" [allergen provokes antibody | provokes->tissue | provokes: effector-response such as rhinitis and asthma].\nScientists Gell and Coombs also classified and termed cell-mediated hypersensitivity which they dubbed \"Type IV Hypersensitivity.\" This is where the \"cellular branch\" of the immune system comes in: T-Cells->intermediate reactions->eczematic \"atopic\" dermatitis. Though atopic dermatitis is a disease state, the cellular immune response is exactly what we try to elicit when we test folk for TB: We want the cellular branch of the IS to mount a response. We say to the patient, \"Come back in two days so I can read your skin.\" This delayed response -- it takes the T-Cells (they're generals) \"time\" to communicate down the ranks to effector molecules (they're the grunts who do the fighting) -- is a sign that the skin is protecting itself. But with atopic dermatitis, it's sort of like Don Quixote fighting the windmills. We're not doubting the ability to \"fight,\" we're doubting that the skin should be treated like a windmill: Yes, there's a genetic or hereditary component to this cell-mediated atopia.\nAnd there's also the same issue of the doubtful opponent with the Type I response the asthmatic has: Why is antibody raising the sword against windmills?\nIn point of fact and in point of frequency: Type I and Type IV hypersensitivity reactions usually belong as symptoms within the same set of individuals. Sure, there are exceptions. But, the general pattern is that we should not be surprised to find a patient presenting with atopic dermatitis who also has food allergies, or asthma, or \"hay fever\". Types I and IV (usually) go together -- if we're talking about the \"atopic state\" of affairs.\nOne immune system with two branches (humoral and cellular). And both branches bear the fruit of our travail.\nClearly, we don't have easy answers because we don't have an easy problem. Purportedly, Einstein once said we need to make everything as simple as we possibly can, but no simpler. <Give us a break!>\nDate: Tue, 20 Feb 1996 14:09:20 -0800 From: Ann Subject: misc.\nGil, Your explanation of the immune response was really good and made sense to me in terms of what I have experienced lately. You said it took 2 days for the skin immune system to react to allergens (as in a TB test). When I was flaring so bad when I first started allergy shots, it was always about 48 hours after a shot. At first, I thought it was happening because I expected it to happen. But one day I got shots; then left the next day on a trip to Asia. As we approached Hong Kong, I really flared (assuming it was the peanut dust in the airplane air). Counting hours now, I know it was the 48 hour post shot reaction. I was totally unaware then of what time it was (my watch was on Asian time). Anyhow, the two day lag is something to remember when trying to figure out the cause of a flare.\nShelly, my parents were the opposite of yours. They just saw one trusted doctor; never even tried food elimination diets; and were offended when anyone suggested an alternative treatment. I always felt their cautious approach kept us from finding a cure. I guess no one can win!\nDate: Fri, 16 Feb 1996 13:36:19 EST From: Wayne Subject: Re: eczema distracts from other probs.\nAnn and eczema community: Re swollen lymph nodes...mine swell when I have staph infections.

I feel better after showering, but am dryer, especially my scalp. But after 2 days of not showering, I feel like a little disgusting grease ball. I use a grapefruit based non-soap to cleanse only the necessary areas and to wash my hair.\nRecently I got to wondering if maybe I should wet myself down daily. What do you all do? I'm especially interested in those of you who have large areas of eczema.\nDate: Thu, 22 Feb 1996 18:46:16 EST From: Wayne Subject: Wet and Dry\nWren, I am sometimes affected 95% of skin surface, now it is primarily dry over 50% of surface (I saw a tip from the National Jewish Center that said that the palm of the hand is about one percent of body...don't try to do this while you are waiting in line at the grocery store....).\nI take soaking baths (20 to 40 mins) whenever I get that dry-all-over feeling. I have to be real careful not to get into a rub-scratch-off-the-used-skin-in-grease situation while soaking. I watch TV. After soak I grease up.\nDate: Thu, 22 Feb 1996 18:12:26 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Re: Is Rationing Rational?\nI don't have large areas of eczema (yet - knock wood), but all of my skin can get itchy and uncomfortable if I shower too often. More than about twice a week tends to cause discomfort.\nHave you tried bathing with tar? I find it very helpful and soothing. The product I like is called Zetar, made by Dermik Laboratories, Collegeville, PA, and it's a prescription item. It's very black and kind of yucky, and it makes the bath water smell like a roofing job on a hot summer day, but it really makes my skin feel good.\nZetar's label states that the tar is dissolved in polysorbates. I don't know what the polysorbates do, but the result is excellent. I soak my hands in this stuff, mixed into a basin of warm water, and it helps a great deal.\nThere's also Balnetar, which is from Westwood and available over the counter. It's a mixture of their \"Alpha Keri\" oil and tar. I don't like this as much because the oil seems to be counter-productive for me, often causing additional itchiness.\nDate: Fri, 23 Feb 1996 16:36:25 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: Is Rationing Rational?\nHi Wren, I pretty much have eczema from head to toe in varying degrees. Because I don't like to tolerate the sloughing (it can be embarrassing), I shower every night--short showers, maybe 5 minutes. I also wash my hair in the shower, which then becomes a 15-20 minute job. Sometimes I'm under the shower long enough to feel \"soaked,\" and then I make sure I cream up all over as much as possible.\nI also shower at least once daily, sometimes more when I'm having more problems. Water gives me the most relief--comfort level is very important to me so that I can concentrate on other things. When I'm wet and then creamed up, I feel more \"loose\" with more freely moving joints--if that makes any sense.\nIf I'm in really good condition, I might skip a shower for one night, but the daily showering keeps the itch down, and the sensation of not feeling \"dirty\" from loose skin particles. So I prefer more water rather than less to keep myself functioning--also, as a safety measure against infection. I've used pHisoderm for soaping, Cetaphil lately, and some bar soaps that are gentle without perfumes. If you are interested in the bar soaps, I'll check on the names.\nI can't stand the gooiness of heavy oils, altho occasionally I've used small amounts of Vitamin E oil I apply Diprolene to my scalp immediately when after a shower when my hair is still wet--it doesn't seem to grease up my hair as much as when the hair is dry. I use water to wash off all the dead skin and doctor the new stuff underneath. If I don't use water, I end up taking it off and then injuring the new skin underneath, which is counterproductive. So that's been my daily regimen for a long time now.\nDate: Fri, 23 Feb 1996 16:46:40 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: Is Rationing Rational?\nHi Ralph, You make the tar \"toilet\" sound very appealing. I'm wondering how one would do this as a practical matter for the scalp and entire body? A black tub afterwards doesn't appeal to me though! I remember using tar in my late teens and early 20s--detested the smell, was sure everyone could tell it and would think I had a bad case of body odor. Eventually, I gave it up because cortisone was so much \"cleaner.\"\nWonder if the Alpha-Keri doesn't have some \"additive\" that is the reason for the itchiness.\nDate: Fri, 23 Feb 1996 17:02:09 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: eczema distracts from other probs.\nHi Ann, I've never had a doctor who was so tactless, but lay people have blurted out loudly \"WHAT have you GOT on your NECK?\" I was too young and stupid and embarrassed; now I wish I had shot back, \"LEPROSY.\" And then laughed at her reaction. Isn't that mean of me? haha\nI've had swollen neck glands--I ended up with something for three weeks and was so weak and sick I lost 30 pounds. A doctor at work diagnosed mumps, but it wasn't mumps. That was 20 years ago. Rarely get swollen glands/lymph nodes anymore. Do get a lot of weeping of scalp and this has been going on for a couple of years now. Am constantly \"soaking\" my head in the shower (along with the rest of me) every nite.\nDate: Fri, 23 Feb 1996 15:36:19 PST From: Wren Subject: Re[2]: Is Rationing Rational?\nRalph, I've never tried using tar products. Does the tar stick to your skin? I'll ask my doctor about the Zetar. Anybody know why tar calms our skin?\nDate: Fri, 23 Feb 1996 16:36:05 -0800 From: Ann Subject: bathing\nI shower once a day in as cool water as possible. I use cetaphil bar soap on underarms, crotch, and feet. (my feet are pretty clear). Right now I'm using regular shampoo , but when scalp is bad, I use T-gel. I put Eucerin creme on all over after drying. (when I'm feeling impoverished and using vaseline, Idon't dry myself at all.) Then I put cortisone on the bad spots. At night I wash my face with cetaphil liquid cleanser and put Eucerin creme all over.\nHere's some things that are on the edge, but I want to share them. I find that shaving my underarms and legs very lightly with an electric razor really helps as long as the skin isn't real bad. My derm doctor suggested I try this to help exfoliate. I also think the vibration of the razor serves as a scratch substitute and I am experimenting with this on the arms too.\nI am going thru some real tough emotional stuff right now. It's in the man-woman area. My skin is really good. I think it's because there's so much natural adrenaline and cortisol in my system. I think I talked with Shelley about this long ago. Does anyone else experience this?\nI also became acquainted with someone who does psychic healing. I let him give me a couple of sessions. (it was for free). Maybe it was the placebo effect or the stress and crying I mentioned above, but skin and sinuses got better and the lymph node went way down.\nDate: Sat, 24 Feb 1996 13:33:08 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: wet/dry/grease\nI have full body eczema, Wren. What works for me is taking a shower once a day and totally greasing up after that. Then through the day, I use washcloth and more ointment for problem spots. For me, it's most important to feel \"clean\", dryness is lower priority. I itch more from too much grease than I do from dryness. But sometimes I feel dry-itchy and need spot wash with creams; sometimes I put on too much ointment and it's too greasy and the skin needs to breathe; other times I can tell that it's probably getting infected and I need Cleocin-T. There are numerous feelings of discomfort and itch and over time I've learned to understand what the nuances signify and what treatment is required for each feeling. Of course, sometimes I misinterpret the feeling and that causes more problems, but basically, it's learning my own body language and forms of communication. Sometimes it feels like our bodies are new life forms trying to evolve or emerge...\nDate: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 14:11:33 EST From: Eric Subject: Houdini\nI have a question for those with experience with children who have eczema. Ezra has it quite bad on his face, mostly on his cheeks and a little on his forehead, neck and chest. We have had to devise various ways to keep him from scratching. We've begun to call him Houdini because he is quite creative in getting his hands free (a little sense of humor goes a long way with this, no?). Any suggestions in this area?\nDate: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 13:55:58 PST From: Wren Subject: Re: bathing\nThanks to ALL of you who have responded to my question about our bathing regimens. Think I'll try bathing more often, and perhaps try out the tar treatment.\nI am going thru some real tough emotional stuff right now. It's in the man-woman area. My skin is really good. I think it's because there's so much natural adrenaline and cortisol in my system. I think I talked with Shelley about this long ago. Does anyone else experience this?\nI've been thinking about emotions and my skin more and more lately. I don't emote easily, though I speak my mind more frequently and vehemently than I did earlier in life. However, I rarely cry. Even when in intense pain from my eczema, I'll just barely whimper. I'm wondering if I was better able to express my sadness and pain, somehow that might lead to an overall release and possibly skin improvement.\nSo maybe your intense emotional outpouring is having a positive effect.\nI also became acquainted with someone who does psychic healing. I let him give me a couple of sessions. (it was for free). Maybe it was the placebo effect or the stress and crying I mentioned above, but skin and sinuses got better and the lymph node went way down.\nThat sounds great. Hey, whatever helps.\nDate: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 16:50:41 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: bathing\nWren, When I was younger I never gave a second's thot to stress/emotions, but at mid-age, it has hit me like a sledge hammer that my psychic well-being or non-well-being is critical.\nUnresolved anger is worst of all--so now I take definite steps to remove myself from chaos. That can be anything from frustrating people to irritating situations. I literally withdraw from those environments/people.\nIn my youth, I was highly placid and tolerant. No more.

My mother used to make me wear soft leggings/mitts/gloves over my hands especially when I was a small kid. Over time I wore holes right through the cloth because itching was beyond my control. When the hand coverings were new and I couldn't itch effectively, I used to scratch as far as possible using my toenails!\nBut keeping fingernails very very short and frequent handwashing is very important to keep from tearing up the skin and preventing infection. Tylenol for kids might help take the edge off your child's nerves--I used to take heavy duty transquilizers--a mere palliative but it makes one so dopey and lethargic. I still rely on aspirin or something similar if I feel antsy. Good luck.\nDate: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 17:23:17 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: Anger\nHi Ann, What is the purpose of saline nasal washes?

You just rinse, and it's gone. My dermatologist kept writing prescriptions for Zetar for a long time before I actually went and bought the stuff. Now I wouldn't be without it, because it's the only thing that soothes in a certain way when I'm very itchy and cracked.\nI think this form of emulsion (Zetar, the one with \"polysorbates\") might be relatively new. I have used various forms of tar since I was a child, and this stuff, though smelly, is in a different league from the others.\nBy the way, I don't think the smell is noticable to anyone else. No one has ever mentioned it to me. But don't use your best white towel with it, as it does stain to some extent.\nDate: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 19:34:55 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: More Tar Madness\nMy doctor (actually his associate, whom I've not met face-to-face) told me that no one really knows why it works.\nThat seems very odd to me. Maybe eczema is not considered a \"hot\" area of research, so no one has bothered to try finding the answer to that question. If the active ingredient(s) were known, I suspect we wouldn't have to use smelly black stuff. It would be something clean and convenient to add to our bath water.\nDate: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 20:10:29 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Re: Houdini\nMy main suggestion is, don't wait around before getting Ezra some effective treatment. We waited until my son was about two, if I recall correctly, or maybe it was 18 months, before we took him to a dermatologist. The pediatrician had been suggesting various innocuous emolients and so forth, which really did nothing.\nThe dermatologist prescribed his usual combination of oral antibiotics, tar baths, and twice-daily applications of Diprolene (steriod) ointment. My son's eczema cleared up after the two-week treatment, which we performed assiduously, and has never returned! His skin still gets a bit itchy from time to time, and we put on a bit of Diprolene, but there has never again been any significant whole-body involvement. He is now seven.\nDate: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 18:03:21 ... From: Richard Subject: TAR\nI seem to remember that tar either deadens the nerves or thickens the skin. Ralph, I used ZETAR. It got into the grouting in the bathtub, blackened everything (towels, clothes) and took a long time to show any results. It didn't do much for me and I must say that I was glad when I stopped using it.\nDate: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 21:42:07 EST From: Gilbert Subject: More Tar Madness\nAbout coal tar's mode of action. Many theories have been suggested, but the only one that enjoys scientific \"approval\" was put forward in a professional paper published by Lowe et al. in 1983. Lowe and his group showed that coal tar has \"antimitotic effects\" and proposes that that might account for some of its action and effect. In other words, coal tar discourages cell replication. Since one of the troubles with psoriasis and some eczemas is the observed \"thickening\" of the skin which tends to \"crack\" and form \"scales,\" we're observing a phenomenon called \"hyperplasia,\" i.e., the skin's over-achiever attempt to regenerate and displace \"because of the injury.\" If an \"antimitotic\" agent can slow down this process, it is conceivable that it can provide some benefit.\nDate: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 23:52:34 -0500 From: Jack Subject: Re: eczema distracts from other probs.\nNadia and I were in a bakery, where one of the friendly clerks struck up a conversation with Nadia.

Amazing what kids can convey sometimes!\nDate: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 23:57:18 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Tar and other speculative thoughts\nBut the mystery of the beneficial effect of tar doesn't really have to remain a mystery, does it? I mean, drug companies sometimes test thousands of compounds to see whether one of them will have particular properties. Surely someone could take a look at a *known* therapeutic agent and figure out why it works...\nDate: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 20:28:48 +0800 From: Dev Subject: Houdini\nDear Eric, Please have Ezra seen to by a dermatologist if you've not already done so. The main reason that he's doing a Houdini is because it itches. A mild topical corticosteroid (eg 1% hydrocortisone or maybe something a little stronger-if he needs it) and emollients can give lots of relief. Many infants with atopic dermatitis are clear of it by their second birthday but to wait a year and a half would be a little unfair to the child.\nMany parents view treatment of AD with steroid creams with a great deal of apprehension and suspicion but topical steroids used appropriately and judiciously, are invaluable in treating AD. Moisturizers equally so.\nThough there is probably some truth in the saying \"to itch is only human but to scratch, divine\", somehow I do not think little Ezra appreciates it.\nI agree with Ralph and feel that too many people (including doctors) spend too much time pussy-footing around with the treatment of AD in infants. I hope that I'm not being too outspoken but I've seen too many children (and indirectly, their parents) suffer unneccessarily from this attitude (which basically arises from ignorance). So get little Houdini treated and maybe he won't be stuck with the nickname for life.\nDate: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 10:54:39 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: More on eczema in infancy\nThere's another dimension to the itching in infancy which I forgot to mention in my last message. My son was small for his age, eating very little, at the time we finally had him seen by the dermatologist. We wondered if there was a connection between the eczema and the loss of appetite, and he told us that babies with eczema usually don't eat well.\nAccording to this line of thinking, the young child's sensory apparatus is overwhelmed with the itching, and doesn't process other sensations like hunger very well. As a result (so goes the theory), the child doesn't really know when s/he is hungry.\nAt 7, our son is still small for his age, but strong and healthy, and we're very glad we had him treated.\nDate: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 09:37:04 PST From: Wren Subject: Re[2]: bathing\nKris, Thanks for your thoughts on the importance of expressing emotions. Have you found that your eczema improves when you vent anger, or perhaps the contrary, have you found that your skin is worse when you don't vent?\nI've made an appointment with a woman who teaches the Alexander technique, which she said is based on rapid eye movements (beats me). She also said that I probably have some blocked emotions that can be adding to my condition. If this helps I'll let you all know.\nIn my youth, I was highly placid and tolerant. No more. I speak up at will now, since I no longer care to please everyone else more than myself.\nI was taught never to show emotions, so it is second nature to bottle things up--not good for skin.

Aren't you lonely? Or are you so involved with your own interests that other people's company isn't that important? I live with my partner, who has two children, so there's daily chaos, anger, frustration, smiles, learning, growth, and love. Can't take only only half of the equation. And for me, the benefits outweigh the difficulties.\nDate: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 17:31:02 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: Re[2]: bathing\nWren, I've never actually documented--just recall skin problems when my psychic health was less than optimal; and nonexistent when I was happy with my life. I do know that prolonged anger has been detrimental this past year, and when I feel miserable I don't want to be around people. I've gone through lots of periods of \"hibernation\" over the years.\nI limit myself to a few good friends and superficial contacts with others, but I'm more interested in the life of the mind than in what passes for conversation on a daily basis--most of it less than profound. I'm not interested in someone's latest foray to the grocery store, if you know what I mean. Books are usually more interesting to me than people. I don't like the aimless busyness I see all around me--not much of sense behind the busyness generally. I've lived alone since I was 27--big change at the time, but I wouldn't go back to the chaos I grew up in. Solitude is very important to me--more important than people just for the sake of people. That's probably why I like this List---it's great to communicate with people like yourself, but I also like the anonymity! I'm not good at close relationships--they make me uncomfortable. And I want to spend my time on personal pursuits in the time I have left.\nDate: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 17:44:03 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: eczema distracts from other probs.\nHi Jack---I think it's heartwarming that your daughter can communicate with you just using expressions! I never had that when I was a kid, so your daughter is one of the lucky ones. You are to be complimented as a parent who has established real sharing in the family. Nadia accepted the woman's pity without going into explanation--even if for a different reason. We adults sometimes underestimate kids' intelligence--they know a lot of things at gut level whether adults spell it out for them or not. I always find it condescending when adults don't tell kids stuff they should know--they know anyway even when it hasn't been put into words by some omniscient older person!\nDate: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 22:09:47 -0800 From: Ann Subject: misc. comments\nKristen, The saline nasal washes are intended to clear out secretions in the hope of preventing an infection in the sinuses. Also, if you use nasal steroids, you want to get your nostrils as clear as possible before spraying so that the drug gets where it is supposed to go. But the washes are time consuming and can precipitate nose bleeds.\nHas anybody else had eczema in the ear canals? The buzz from itching there (with Q tips) is so intense, I have come very close to blacking out.\nDate: Wed, 28 Feb 1996 14:29:11 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: Eric and Ezra\nI was struck by your reference to Houdini. He was my idol as a child because my parents would tie me up in restraints (handcuffs, strait jackets, ropes, chains, you name it) to keep me from scratching but I would always figure out how to escape - a la Houdini! And then I would get my revenge by scratching even more furiously! Restraints may have helped me keep from scratching for certain periods of time but psychologically they were the worst thing for me. To this day I still am negatively affected by that experience. I cannot emphasize enough that it's an awful thing to do to a child. I know it's difficult for very young children to have any self-control. I recommend keeping the fingernails extremely short, encouraging the child to hold something in the hand at night, bite the arm or whatever's in reach, or to pinch or slap the skin lightly instead of scratching, but don't tie them down! What worked best for me is when I learned to tuck my hands under my butt and pretend they were paralyzed. Later I learned to touch my fingertips together one by one in a slow repetitive pattern that was hypnotic and calming.\nDate: Thu, 29 Feb 1996 10:39:46 -0500 From: Robert Subject: bathing\nThis discussion on anger intrigues me since I have come to believe that venting anger more easily may very well increase the level of anger one attains more easily, and, therefore a \"ventor\" of anger may actually operate at a higher anger level most of the time because becoming angry happens more easily and venting is a pleasureable, ok activity if that makes sense to anyone else. Also, I find that it has become much harder for me to accept other people in friendships and to make friends as I have gotten older...I don't have the patience it seems for mindless discussion for discussion sake and find it hard tolerate people unless they have something to say...I believe this creates a wall to some extent, therefore making new friends becomes harder.\nDate: Thu, 29 Feb 1996 11:02:41 -0500 From: Robert Subject: Re: Houdini\nWhen I was an infant and had eczema, I was taken off of cows milk and goats milk was substituted. That helped me (I have been told).\nDate: Thu, 29 Feb 1996 17:26:46 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: misc. comments\nAnn, I've had sinusitis for so many years I probably wouldn't know if I had an infection or not--I just have constant runny nose and eyes. It's a real irritant. Tears run down my face constantly, esp on very cold windy days. And the constant itchy eyes makes for regular blurry vision. It's a mess.\nI don't know about you, but when I'm in the the middle of eczematoid throes, I want nothing to do with people. Being included is the last thing on my mind. I believe the skin thing came first, and the psychic woes are a result of it.\nI've always had sloughing ear canals. I keep trying to debride them, esp right after a shower because the skin is softened. I've never had intense itch in the ear canals, but they slough only when I'm also having scalp, face and neck eczema flares. When I clean out the ear canals other times, I end up with weeping and subsequent infection and then ear pain throughout. Until I beat the infection down.\nDate: Thu, 29 Feb 1996 17:52:32 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: Re[2]: bathing\nHi Robert, Welcome back. Good to hear you did so well in the sun. You must not be an inveterate cortisone user. My skin doesn't like sun anymore--it just gets mottled and burns in spots. Altho some antibiotics use precludes exposure to sun also. Perhaps you would agree that the psyche is a big factor in eczema now that you've come back to the ratrace.\nI disagree with your conclusions about anger. I think it is better to find ways to vent anger than bottle it up. I don't think it's very pleasureable to \"spout,\" altho it may be necessary. Sometimes blowing it off takes the pressure off the \"cooker.\" One's level of anger may be commensurate with an incident; because sometimes anger is very justified. I don't like to think that anger is bad just because it's anger. Venting it, and then thinking thru the reasons for it may be more beneficial, along with deciding to handle it differently. Rather than just complaining, better to take some kind of action.\nAnger has never been an acceptable emotion for women to show--doesn't mean we don't have it. We've always just been taught a \"lady\" doesn't show it. I discarded that tenet several years ago--it didn't suit me. I threw off the placid mantle because I was tired of being treated like a doormat. Women's behavior rarely fits the societal myths that bind us.\nDate: Thu, 29 Feb 1996 22:47:39 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Anger\nKristen, For about two years I have been going to a weekly therapy group in which the leader occasionally suggests that someone do \"anger work\" either in the group or at home. This consists of using a soft, padded bat or a pillow to beat something like a bed or a couch. I tried this a few times and to my surprise it really helped me feel better! Once in a while now I pick up a pillow and beat something with it. I do this in private (unless I'm at the therapy group) because other people usually feel scared or disturbed by it.\nCopyright of the individual messages rests with those who posted them.

But for these patients, the injections can make allow them to function normally, rather than\u00a0be debilitated by red plaques that can even appear on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet or the eyelids, lips or genitals.\nPsoriasis results from an immune system malfunction that causes skin cells to turn over far more rapidly than normal, creating patches of thick silver-scaled skin that can itch and bleed. About\u00a0one-third of\u00a0individuals with psoriasis (called \"psoriatics\") have a severe form of the disease, covering anywhere from 30% to 100% of their bodies.\nAdditionally, approximately 10% of psoriatics have a related condition known as psoriatic arthritis, which affects the joints and causes the same sort of pain and stiffness that characterizes most forms of arthritis.\nFor patients whose skin or joints are acutely affected, the development of biologics over the past decade has been a major step, replacing or augmenting their past therapeutic strategies of topical creams, phototherapy or pills. Biologics -- which include compounds such as Amevive (alefacept), and Enbrel (etanercept) -- work by hindering the overproduction and inflammation of skin cells by the immune system.\nHowever, for some psoriatics, the self-injections required to administer these medications are a major downside. An estimated 7% to 22%\u00a0of the general population has \"injection phobia,\" which, understandably, limits the attractiveness of this treatment method.\nOn the other hand, because biologics are generally pre-dosed in small syringes that deliver the medicine with a quick click of a finger, psoriatics often find that the anticipation of self-injecting is far worse than the reality.\nThe syringes, which resemble ballpoint pens, hide the needle from sight and inject the compound just under the skin of the thigh. Since the medicines are systemic, patients need to be monitored by a doctor and are at risk of increased infections and other immune system side effects resulting from the medication.\n\"It's painless and fast,\" says Doris J. Day, MD, clinical assistant professor of dermatology at New York University Medical Center, who noted that injections need only be done once or twice a week. \"It doesn't look like a needle or syringe. And it's very liberating to people who have been applying (prescription) creams to so many spots for so long. They can be clear for months.\"\nLeah Bird, 55 -- a Newton, MA, native who has\u00a0extensive experience with psoriasis -- injects herself once a week with a biologic and finds that it clears her skin and significantly tames her psoriatic arthritis.\n\"For me, it's the difference between walking and not walking,\" Bird says. \"The shots definitely sting, but there's no debate for me about it being worth it.\"\nDermatologists say they make sure patients are comfortable with the injection procedure before they have to tackle it on their own. But for those who are still anxious about self-injecting, there are a variety of strategies that may be helpful. For example, you can try:\nApplying ice to the injection site first. Ice helps numb the area to deaden the sting of the shot.\nDeep breathing. Doing so with your eyes closed for a few minutes before injecting can be helpful.\nCognitive reframing. This involves examining your thoughts about self-injecting, deciding which ones are not accurate or helpful and modifying them. For example, thoughts such as \"these injections are just another source of discomfort\" can be re-framed into \"injections help keep me healthy.\"\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Working with a therapist familiar with CBT can help provide additional strategies for overcoming your discomfort with self-injection.\nSources:\nNinfa Cantu.

In the four- to five-year-olds, 9% of children living in the north of the country (10 degrees to 29 degrees S) had eczema, compared to 15% of children in the centre of the country(29 to 35 S) and 19%% in the south (35 to 43 S).\nIn this group, on multivariate analysis, with the northernmost region (i.e., closest to the equator) as the reference, kids were 75% likelier to have eczema in the central region and more than two and a half times likelier if they lived in the south.\nAllergies don\u2019t change by latitude\nAmong the eight- and nine-year olds, eczema rates from north to south were 8%, 12%, and 13%, and adjusted odds ratios in the central and southern regions were 1.6 and 1.9.\nThe researchers identified similar latitude gradients for peanut allergies in both age groups, and for egg allergies in the younger children. (Egg allergy couldn't be investigated in the older children, because there were no cases of egg allergy in the north.)\nThe prevalence of allergies to cow's milk, wheat , or \"other\" foods did not change by latitude. Soy and sesame allergy also showed no latitudinal gradient, but because these allergies were rare, the researchers note, the study may have been underpowered to detect any difference.\n\"We were not surprised at the lack of association of other food allergies with latitude because these would include other mechanisms of food allergy, including non-IgE and food intolerances, as opposed to IgE type alone,\" Dr Osborne and his team wrote.\nThey also didn't see any latitudinal gradient in asthma prevalence, which could suggest, they said, \"that developing asthma is potentially due to a different pathologic pathway to peanut and egg allergy.\"\n\"Investigating these phenomena at a finer level by using meteorological data, such as temperature and solar (irradiance), as well as serologic measures of vitamin D, might provide more clues to the nature of these associations,\" the authors concluded.\n(Reuters Health, March 2012)\n"}, {"score": 833.7313, "uuid": "8d127be0-c9f2-5762-bf64-5b3c3d9234ef", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1613wb-02-10073", "target_hostname": "www.lisabarger.com", "target_uri": "http://www.lisabarger.com/what-is-it/", "page_rank": 1.1922284e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "<em>What</em> <em>Is</em> It? - LisaBarger.com", "snippet": "And along <em>the</em> way, we\u2019ll help you find <em>the</em> info you need to make informed choices about your own health. \u201c<em>What</em> <em>is</em> resveratrol?

Since supplement promoters often accuse drug companies and the \"medical establishment\" of suppressing their work, I find it amusing that the opposite appears to have happened. This article desribes what I observed about EPO marketing in the 1980s.\nIn 1989, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked me to examine the marketing of evening primrose oil and borage oil products by Efamol Ltd. and its principal American distributors. U.S. Federal laws required that products marketed for the prevention, cure, mitigation or treatment of disease be \"generally recognized by experts as safe and effective\" recognized as safe and effective for their intended purposes. The health-food industry markets thousands of such products, but in most cases the intended purpose is not printed on the product label, where it could render the manufacturer an easy target for government regulators. Instead, this information is transmitted through other channels of communication that are less obvious or may not be subject to regulation. The documents I reviewed outlined the most elaborate marketing scheme I have seen in which a \"dietary supplement\" company promoted claims through other channels that would not be legal in labeling or advertising.\nBackground History\nPO's primary promoter was David Horrobin, M.D., Ph.D. (1939-2003), a Canadian medical professor who decided to commercialize research he had been doing for several years into gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), which is EPO's active ingedient. In 1977, he and his wife (Sherri Clarkson) founded the Efamol Company for that purpose [3]. The following year, Efamol joined Agricultural Holdings, a large British manufacturer that had been breeding evening primrose plants, moved to East London, and began making its first products. In 1981, the company's Canadian division, Efamol Research, Inc. moved to Nova Scotia, and the manufacturing division, Efamol Ltd., relocated to Guildford, England. The company later changed its name to Scotia, became listed on the London Stock Exchange, and made Horrobin one of the 100 richest people in England. In 1997, he left Scotia and set up a new company, Laxdale Ltd, to develop pharmaceuticals for psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders [4,5].\nDuring the early 1980s, Efamol's EPO was marketed in the United States as Evening Primrose Oil from England(tm) by Health From the Sun Products, Inc., of Dover, Massachusetts. The company advertised in trade magazines that EPO was \"the biggest sales opportunity since vitamin C . . . . because there is more authoritative medical and nutritional evidence behind Evening Primrose Oil than any other product ever introduced into the health food industry.\" Horrobin's picture and endorsement of Efamol EPO appeared in this ad with no mention that he was president and managing director of the company that produced it. The ad made no health claims, but retailers who responded were sent multiple copies of customer handouts in which such claims appeared. One was a flyer which claimed that EPO enables weight loss without dieting, slows down the aging process, is effective against PMS, lowers cholesterol as effectively as drugs, lowers blood pressure, can help most people with mild or moderate rheumatoid arthritis, helps hyperactive children, and slows down the progress of multiple sclerosis. Another handout was a magazine article entitled \"Evening Primrose Oil-Miracle Worker of the Eighties,\" written by Horrobin. It stated that half of the people who took 2 to 4 grams of EPO lost weight without a conscious effort to diet and that EPO had significantly improved eczema in adults and children, produced dramatic improvement in women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and helped women with painful, lumpy breasts.\nBy the mid-1980s, Efamol's products were sold in the United States and more than 25 other countries. During this period, although Efamol \"officially\" maintained that its EPO products were foods or \"dietary supplements,\" therapeutic claims for them were disseminated by the company and a succession of American distributors.\nIn 1985, Nature's Way of Springville, Utah, took over as Efamol's exclusive American distributor. Like its predecessor, Nature's Way made few health claims in its magazine ads but transmitted many through other channels. Its May/June 1985 newsletter for retailers, for example, stated that Nature's Way Evening Primrose Oil \"assists the body in expelling waste by strengthening the body's immune system, and helping circulation. It is also valuable in fighting skin problems, and helping faulty tear ducts and salivary glands.\" The Efamol Corporate Video, distributed in November 1985, contained the following ideas:\nThe company is \"pioneering research into natural sources of new medicines,\"\nVarious disorders might be caused by a \"metabolic block\" in fatty acid metabolism that prevents formation of adequate amounts of prostaglandin.\nEfamol Ltd. has actively encouraged and coordinated independent research using EPO into a variety of disorders, \"including dermatological disease, gynecological problems, and cardiovascular diseases in which possible deficiency of prostaglandins has been implicated.\"\n\"Efamol products are currently marketed as foods and dietary supplements and are not licensed for clinical usage other than in approved clinical trials.\"\nIn 1986, Nature's Way announced that it was starting a library of videotapes that retailers could borrow, free of charge, to help train their staff. The first such video contained a lecture Dr. Horrobin gave earlier that year on \"The Role of Essential Fatty Acids and Prostaglandins in Health.\" The lecture was given at a trade show in Anaheim, California, where Horrobin was introduced by Ken Murdock, president of Nature's Way. During the lecture, Horrobin said that although virtually all Americans get abundant amounts of essential fatty acids in their diet, 20% \"may have flaws in the body\" that limit their full use. Thus, he asserted, there occurs a functional deficiency of a metabolite called gamma linolenic acid (GLA), which is needed to produce prostaglandins. Horrobin's solution, of course, was to consume Efamol EPO, which is rich in GLA.\nThroughout his lecture, Horrobin stressed that he and his company were deeply committed to research and had generated more than a hundred clinical studies. He said that he was particularly proud of studies with negative results (for weight-reduction, for example) because their existence added credibility to the positive ones. In discussing some of the studies, he showed slides of the dosages used. Thus retailers who attended the lecture, as well as those who viewed the videotape, could tell precisely how to \"prescribe\" the products to their customers. An undercover investigator who borrowed the tape in 1988 \"to show a customer with PMS\" was told that ten copies were circulating.\nDuring the same period, dozens of articles in Bestways Let's Live, Better Nutrition, Today's Living, Total Health, Medical Self-Care, and other magazines that habitually promoted dubious nutrition ideas recommended EPO for PMS and other conditions. Some of these articles mentioned Efamol by name and a few cited Horrobin's work. Ads for Efamol EPO and/or other EPO products appeared in almost every issue containing an article about evening primrose oil.\nThe December 1983 issue of the British magazine She described a study in which three hundred of its readers took Efamol EPO for premenstrual syndrome. She's article, entitled \"The Efamol Verdict,\" called the results \"dramatic\" and said that 78% showed improvement in depression, 87% in irritability, 72% in headaches, 75% in pain/tenderness, and 71% in joint swelling. Soon afterward, an Efamol news bulletin advised: \"Perhaps you can organize a similar study in your market. The results to PMS sufferers as well as to sales can only be dramatic.\"\nIn October 1985, one Efamol bulletin included a \"Training Manual,\" the front cover of which stated \"strictly for internal use and readership only.\" Its introduction stated, \"If you are to be involved in actually selling Efamol products then you will soon extract the information you require to perform your task efficiently. . . . The manual should be retained of course, for reference purposes for the day when a customer asks that very question you knew the answer to but can't remember.\" Section 6 of the manual referred readers to several publications that promote the use of Efamol products. The manual stated that one of these publications was \"a useful Public Relations tool,\" while another \"considers different medical applications of Efamol.\"\nIn March 1987, Efamol Ltd. distributed copies of women's magazine articles reporting that Efamol's EPO had helped its readers with PMS. The accompanying bulletin indicated that the articles \"represent another excellent example of the valuable role played by PR in supporting the marketing of Efamol.\" Another bulletin stated: \"Dr. Horrobin has recently written the enclosed review of PMS for a consumer magazine aimed at young mothers in the U.S.A.\" The article gave specific directions for using Efamol EPO for PMS and stated, \"For most women, PMS can now be a thing of the past.\"\nOther documents described how Efamol Ltd. had used public relations as a marketing tool. For example, a 1983 bulletin said that the main objective of a news conference held in New York by Horrobin in 1982 \"was to make known as widely as possible the new discovery of the benefits to eczema sufferers of EFAMOL capsules taken orally. Media used: Newspapers, Magazines, Radio, TV, News Agencies.\" The letter was accompanied by a list of more than one hundred press outlets that carried stories. In August 1983, Efamol Ltd. distributed copies of a Redbook magazine article recommending evening primrose oil for PMS. The article described Dr. Horrobin's work and stated that \"the usual dosage is six to eight 500-mg capsules daily.\" Multiple reprints of the Redbook article were distributed to health-food retailers throughout the United States by Health From the Sun, described by Efamol Ltd. as the major subdistributor of Efamol in the United States at that time. In October 1985, Efamol Ltd. distributed multiple copies of an article from Current Therapeutics, which it said would \"be of great value in your PR activities.\"\nIn November 1986, Efamol Ltd. distributed an article from Rodale's Allergy Relief Newsletter which suggested evening primrose oil for eczema. In a sidebar, Horrobin advised readers to stick to name brands, such as Efamol or Naudicelle. The company advised its distributors that the article \"may be particularly interesting to any local eczema societies you may have.\"\nIn March 1987, Efamol Ltd. distributed a news bulletin headlined \"American PMS Self-Help Group Publishes Article by Dr. Horrobin.\" The article stated that \"a relatively minor problem of [essential fatty acid] nutrition is the commonest cause of PMS. This can be corrected by lifestyle changes and/or by direct supplementation with GLA in the form of evening primrose oil.\" The published article was introduced with a note that readers could write directly to Dr. Horrobin \"to request reprints of this and other articles describing his research.\"\nIn October 1987, Efamol Ltd. distributed an article from a British magazine which stated: \"Any misconception that Efamol is a company producing mere dietary supplements and dabbling on the fringe of the medical scene are quickly dispelled by Horrobin. He has always thought of the Efamol essential fatty acids as pharmaceuticals, he says, but marketing them originally as nutritional supplements has provided the means to generate cash to fund continuing research.\" The article also states that product licenses had been applied for in the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Norway, New Zealand, and Canada for the treatment of atopic eczema with an EPO product, while approval for the same product as an over-the-counter supplement for PMS had already been granted in Finland and was pending in France.\nEfamol's EPO products were also marketed to health professionals through many channels.\nIn November 1986, Dr. Horrobin sent a memo to Nature's Way suggesting an \"Efamol Good Health Program\" that would include specified dosages of four EPO products for eczema, diabetes, arthritis, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma, allergies, psoriasis and PMS. In 1987, Murdock Pharmaceuticals (a Nature's Way subsidiary) distributed much of this information-almost word-for-word-to its physician customers.\nThe listing in the 1986 Physicians' Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs included dosage and stated: \"Indications: For the relief of symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, such as mood changes (anxiety, irritability, nervous tension and depression), water retention (swelling), abdominal bloating, breast pain and tenderness, and fatigue.\" The same information appeared in the 1987 edition of this book under Murdock Pharmaceuticals instead of Nature's Way.\nA January 1987 memo from Murdock Pharmaceuticals to Horrobin related how Murdock had exhibited at a convention of the American College of Advancement in Medicine (a group of physicians engaged in such unscientific practices as chelation therapy for atherosclerosis). The memo also mentioned that ads have been placed in Complementary Medicine magazine and the Physicians' Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs. Ads in the Nov./Dec. 1986 and Jan./Feb. 1987 issues of Complementary Medicine contained no therapeutic claims but invited doctors to contact Murdock Pharmaceuticals for further information. The earlier ad, shown on the following page, pictured the hands of a doctor writing a prescription for Efamol products.\nMurdock's \"Efamol PMS Promotion Campaign\" included advertisements to pharmacists; letters to physicians, pharmacists and \"PMS sufferers\"; and a \"PMS Symptom and Treatment Chart.\" The ad to pharmacists (in California Pharmacist, Sept. 1987) said Efamol PMS was \"the primary constituent in a recommended PMS program.\" The letter to pharmacists mentioned that the product was listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs.\nIn May 1987, a Murdock vice-president wrote to the Arthritis Foundation to suggest that the Foundation distribute information that Efamol products were an alternative in treating arthritis for those who suffer side effects from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS).\nIn 1989, after reviewing more than a thousand pages of documents, I advised the FDA:\nIt is clear that Efamol Ltd. has been engaged in a continuous and systematic campaign to establish in the public mind that Efamol EPO is useful against PMS and various other diseases and conditions.\nAny restraint shown in the claims is related to the knowledge that they may be illegal in labeling..\nIt is self-evident that consumers won't buy products unless they perceive a need for them. It is also obvious that a product claimed to be effective in a troublesome condition (such as PMS) will sell much better than one advertised to relieve a supposed deficiency of a chemical (gamma-linolenic acid).\nAlthough Dr. Horrobin has claimed to have done sufficient research to establish that evening primrose oil is safe and effective against PMS and eczema, he has not gained FDA approval for marketing evening primrose oil products as drugs in the United States. Marketing them as \"food supplements\" is a transparent attempt to evade the food and drug laws.\nRegulatory Actions\nIn 1979, the FDA had notified Efamol representatives that EPO could not be imported into the United States unless the company sought and obtained approval by filing an appropriate food additive petition or new drug application. Efamol agreed not to export EPO to the United States, but in 1985 it began shipping it in bulk to California for encapsulation. The capsules would then be shipped to distributors who would market them as dietary supplements through health-food stores or by mail-order. In 1985, the FDA issued an Import Alert to detain EPO labeled for food use because the agency considered it an unsafe food additive.\nIn 1984, General Nutrition, Inc., three of its officers, and two of its retail store managers were charged with conspiring to defraud the FDA and violating provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which require that drug products be approved by the FDA as safe and effective prior to marketing. The indictment alleged:\nBetween 1980 and 1981, General Nutrition, its president (Gary Daum), and two vice-presidents conspired to purchase EPO from Efamol Ltd. and to promote and sell it under the name Gammaprim for the prevention and treatment of high blood pressure, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and other ailments.\nIn 1980, one of the defendants received a letter from Horrobin suggesting that Efamol products be marketed without FDA approval. Referring to EPO's supposed beneficial effects, the letter stated, \"Obviously you could not advertise Efamol for these purposes but equally obviously there are ways of getting the information across.\" Subsequent company memos described an elaborate promotional scheme that included newspaper articles, radio talk shows, and publications for use in General Nutrition's retail stores. In addition, oral claims were made by retail employees to prospective customers. FDA investigators posing as customers at various stores in western New York State were told that Gammaprim would be better for treatment of high blood pressure than the prescription drugs Nitrostat or Diuril, and that it was good for arthritis as well.\nBy virtue of these claims, Gammaprim became a drug within the meaning of the law. However, rather than submitting the product to the FDA for premarket evaluation, defendants sought to disguise it as a food supplement, thereby attempting to defraud the FDA [6].\nIn motions to stop the prosecution, the defendants claimed: (a) their right to free speech was being violated, (b) the prosecution was unfair because many other companies making health claims in advertising had not been criminally prosecuted, (c) Gammaprim should not be considered a drug because it is not inherently toxic, and (d) the laws under which they were being prosecuted were too vague. In 1986, these motions were dismissed by a federal judge who noted that the defendants were aware, or should have been aware, that they were breaking the law. A few months later, General Nutrition pled guilty to four counts of misbranding a drug and agreed to pay $10,000 to the government as reimbursement for costs of prosecution. Daum (who was no longer its president) pled guilty to one count of misbranding and was fined $1,000. The remaining charges against other employees were dismissed. Horrobin was not prosecuted ifor his role in the alleged conspiracy, but I believe he could have been.\nDuring 1988, FDA investigators who visited one pharmacy and several health-food stores were told by a salesperson that EPO was effective for PMS, arthritis, and/or eczema. The investigators were shown magazine articles or other literature containing claims of this type. During the same year, at the FDA's request, a U.S. marshal seized 21 barrels containing EPO and vitamin E, plus quantities of five Efamol products. In 1989, forty-five more barrels of EPO were seized en route to California for encapsulation. In both cases, the FDA charged that Efamol Ltd. was marketing an unapproved food additive. With respect to the products, the FDA also charged that they were unapproved new drugs and misbranded. Federal district judges agreed with the FDA and ordered the seized materials destroyed. Efamol's appeals all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court were unsuccessful.\nDuring these proceedings, Efamol Ltd. was compelled to produce documents which showed how it had spread therapeutic claims through press conferences, news releases, \"news bulletins\" to distributors, and many other channels of communication. Between 1983 and 1989, the company had issued more than 60 bulletins reporting on EPO research and other developments. Many were accompanied by reprints from scientific journals, newspapers, or magazines. A few were accompanied by a television transcript, booklet, or book. These materials promoted EPO for treating PMS, alcoholism, pregnancy-induced hypertension, atopic eczema, elevated cholesterol levels, hypertension, scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, mastalgia (breast pain) and other problems. The bulletins encouraged use of the information for public relations purposes. The company also published and distributed bibliographies of scientific publications relevant to EPO to health-food retailers throughout the United States. Some of the references in these bibliographies were emphasized by highlighted quotes -- including some from Dr. Horrobin's paper -- which made explicit therapeutic claims for Efamol's EPO. Some of the bulletins included a statement like, \"The way in which this information is used must, of course, be consistent with local regulations which generally do not permit direct medical claims in advertisements, etc.\" Most of these documents were included in the materials the FDA gave me to review.\nResearch Findings\nAt the time I did my FDA review, it appeared to me that more commercially-sponsored research had been done on evening primrose oil than on any other dietary supplement. But the situation also struck me as peculiar. If EPO were genuinely useful, why weren't there lots of independent studies? I also wondered whether any of the Horrobin's data were faked. Although I had no evidence that they were, his marketing strategies made me question his honesty. Distribution of his videotaped lecture to retailers about EPO was a criminal act, and his memo to GNC about \"obvious way of getting the message across\" made it clear that he clearly understood the law. Would someone that contemptuous of the law have any qualms about faking data? One instance of probable fraud in the early 1990s came to light when the British General Medical Counsel concluded that a neurophysiologist who studied the use of Efamol in diabetics had falsified data and been promised a royalty if the product were approved for drug use. However, the Council's report made no mention of Horrobin and concluded that this was an isolated incident that was motivated by misguided belief rather than financial considerations [7].\nAssuming that the research was all legitimate, was it reasonable to conclude that EPO safe and effective for any of its intended purposes or that EPO worked by correcting a \"GLA deficiency\"? In the early 1990s, Purdue University's Varro E. Tyler, Ph.D., a leading authority on plant medicines, looked very carefully at Horrobin's writings and concluded:\n[Horrobin's theories] would be valid only if all of the specified conditions are favorably influenced by additional production in the body of prostaglandin E1 and if a deficiency of GLA is the single factor responsible for limited prostaglandin production. Both of these factors remain unproven. If they are not true, then [assuming] that evening primrose oil [is effective] in such conditions is somewhat like assuming one's car will run better if the gas tank is completely full instead of half full. Some clinical evidence exists supporting the possible efficacy of evening primrose oil in the treatment of . . . PMS . . . sore breasts, multiple sclerosis, atopic eczema, various diabetes-associated problems, cardiovascular disease, and several other conditions. . . .However, the validity of some of the reports has been refuted or at least questioned. An Australian study . . . of evening primrose oil in treating women with moderate PMS concluded that the improvement was solely a placebo effect. . . . Furthermore, there are no data to support the safety of long-term consumption [8].\nIn 1993 and 2000, other reviewers looked at studies of evening primrose oil or borage oil (which contains higher concentrations of GLA) for eczema concluded that the largest and best of them did not show convincing evidence of any benefit [9,10]. In December 2003, the British Medical Journal reported a well-designed study of 140 eczema patients who took either a high dose of GLA or a placebo for 12 weeks showed no difference between the two groups [11]. The report was accompanied by an editorial [2] which stated that:\nHorrobin co-authored a 1989 meta-analysis that praised research sponsored by his company and unjustifiably criticized a large independent study that showed negative results.\nThe authors of negative study were unable to achieve publication of a well-reasoned defense of their study.\nA subsequent review with negative conclusions did not get published because Scotia threatened to sue if it were.\nIn 1995, the British Department of Health commissioned a meta-analysis of 20 studies, which included 10 unpublished studies held by the company. Although the report produced a relatively clear conclusion, the authors were not permitted to make it public.\nThe Health Technology Assessment systematic review published in 2000 provided an opportunity for the company to hand over its unpublished studies for inclusion in that report, but it did not do so.\nIn April 2003, the British Medical Journal published an obituary of Horrobin which charged that \"evening primrose oil . . . may go down in history as the remedy for which there is no disease, and David Horrobin . . . may prove to be the greatest snake oil salesman of his age.\"[12] The editorial triggered more than 100 angry responses from Horrobin's family, former business associates, scientists who described how Horrobin had been extremely kind and helpful to them, and others who said they had not known Horrobin but thought that the obituary showed extremely poor taste. None of the critics mentioned the improper marketing activities I have described in this report.\nReferences\n"}, {"score": 828.4321, "uuid": "a76624a2-4b7b-553b-a806-7e01204a0e8d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-15-28169", "target_hostname": "www.quackwatch.com", "target_uri": "http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/DSH/epo.html", "page_rank": 1.1776948e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "Primrose Oil and <em>Eczema</em>: How Research Was Promoted and Supressed", "snippet": "In December 2003, <em>the</em> British Medical Journal reported a well-designed study of 140 <em>eczema</em> patients who took either a high dose of GLA or a placebo for 12 weeks showed no <em>difference</em> between <em>the</em> two groups", "explanation": null, "document": "How Research Was Promoted and Supressed\nStephen Barrett, M.D.\nIn 2001, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), which oversees drug products in the United Kingdom, licensed evening primrose oil (EPO) products for the symptomatic relief of atopic eczema and the relief of breast pain.

Soon afterward, an Efamol news bulletin advised: \"Perhaps you can organize a similar study in your market. The results to PMS sufferers as well as to sales can only be dramatic.\"\nIn October 1985, one Efamol bulletin included a \"Training Manual,\" the front cover of which stated \"strictly for internal use and readership only.\" Its introduction stated, \"If you are to be involved in actually selling Efamol products then you will soon extract the information you require to perform your task efficiently. . . . The manual should be retained of course, for reference purposes for the day when a customer asks that very question you knew the answer to but can't remember.\" Section 6 of the manual referred readers to several publications that promote the use of Efamol products. The manual stated that one of these publications was \"a useful Public Relations tool,\" while another \"considers different medical applications of Efamol.\"\nIn March 1987, Efamol Ltd. distributed copies of women's magazine articles reporting that Efamol's EPO had helped its readers with PMS. The accompanying bulletin indicated that the articles \"represent another excellent example of the valuable role played by PR in supporting the marketing of Efamol.\" Another bulletin stated: \"Dr. Horrobin has recently written the enclosed review of PMS for a consumer magazine aimed at young mothers in the U.S.A.\" The article gave specific directions for using Efamol EPO for PMS and stated, \"For most women, PMS can now be a thing of the past.\"\nOther documents described how Efamol Ltd. had used public relations as a marketing tool. For example, a 1983 bulletin said that the main objective of a news conference held in New York by Horrobin in 1982 \"was to make known as widely as possible the new discovery of the benefits to eczema sufferers of EFAMOL capsules taken orally. Media used: Newspapers, Magazines, Radio, TV, News Agencies.\" The letter was accompanied by a list of more than one hundred press outlets that carried stories. In August 1983, Efamol Ltd. distributed copies of a Redbook magazine article recommending evening primrose oil for PMS. The article described Dr. Horrobin's work and stated that \"the usual dosage is six to eight 500-mg capsules daily.\" Multiple reprints of the Redbook article were distributed to health-food retailers throughout the United States by Health From the Sun, described by Efamol Ltd. as the major subdistributor of Efamol in the United States at that time. In October 1985, Efamol Ltd. distributed multiple copies of an article from Current Therapeutics, which it said would \"be of great value in your PR activities.\"\nIn November 1986, Efamol Ltd. distributed an article from Rodale's Allergy Relief Newsletter which suggested evening primrose oil for eczema. In a sidebar, Horrobin advised readers to stick to name brands, such as Efamol or Naudicelle. The company advised its distributors that the article \"may be particularly interesting to any local eczema societies you may have.\"\nIn March 1987, Efamol Ltd. distributed a news bulletin headlined \"American PMS Self-Help Group Publishes Article by Dr. Horrobin.\" The article stated that \"a relatively minor problem of [essential fatty acid] nutrition is the commonest cause of PMS. This can be corrected by lifestyle changes and/or by direct supplementation with GLA in the form of evening primrose oil.\" The published article was introduced with a note that readers could write directly to Dr. Horrobin \"to request reprints of this and other articles describing his research.\"\nIn October 1987, Efamol Ltd. distributed an article from a British magazine which stated: \"Any misconception that Efamol is a company producing mere dietary supplements and dabbling on the fringe of the medical scene are quickly dispelled by Horrobin. He has always thought of the Efamol essential fatty acids as pharmaceuticals, he says, but marketing them originally as nutritional supplements has provided the means to generate cash to fund continuing research.\" The article also states that product licenses had been applied for in the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Norway, New Zealand, and Canada for the treatment of atopic eczema with an EPO product, while approval for the same product as an over-the-counter supplement for PMS had already been granted in Finland and was pending in France.\nEfamol's EPO products were also marketed to health professionals through many channels.\nIn November 1986, Dr. Horrobin sent a memo to Nature's Way suggesting an \"Efamol Good Health Program\" that would include specified dosages of four EPO products for eczema, diabetes, arthritis, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma, allergies, psoriasis and PMS. In 1987, Murdock Pharmaceuticals (a Nature's Way subsidiary) distributed much of this information-almost word-for-word-to its physician customers.\nThe listing in the 1986 Physicians' Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs included dosage and stated: \"Indications: For the relief of symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, such as mood changes (anxiety, irritability, nervous tension and depression), water retention (swelling), abdominal bloating, breast pain and tenderness, and fatigue.\" The same information appeared in the 1987 edition of this book under Murdock Pharmaceuticals instead of Nature's Way.\nA January 1987 memo from Murdock Pharmaceuticals to Horrobin related how Murdock had exhibited at a convention of the American College of Advancement in Medicine (a group of physicians engaged in such unscientific practices as chelation therapy for atherosclerosis). The memo also mentioned that ads have been placed in Complementary Medicine magazine and the Physicians' Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs. Ads in the Nov./Dec. 1986 and Jan./Feb. 1987 issues of Complementary Medicine contained no therapeutic claims but invited doctors to contact Murdock Pharmaceuticals for further information. The earlier ad, shown on the following page, pictured the hands of a doctor writing a prescription for Efamol products.\nMurdock's \"Efamol PMS Promotion Campaign\" included advertisements to pharmacists; letters to physicians, pharmacists and \"PMS sufferers\"; and a \"PMS Symptom and Treatment Chart.\" The ad to pharmacists (in California Pharmacist, Sept. 1987) said Efamol PMS was \"the primary constituent in a recommended PMS program.\" The letter to pharmacists mentioned that the product was listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs.\nIn May 1987, a Murdock vice-president wrote to the Arthritis Foundation to suggest that the Foundation distribute information that Efamol products were an alternative in treating arthritis for those who suffer side effects from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS).\nIn 1989, after reviewing more than a thousand pages of documents, I advised the FDA:\nIt is clear that Efamol Ltd. has been engaged in a continuous and systematic campaign to establish in the public mind that Efamol EPO is useful against PMS and various other diseases and conditions.\nAny restraint shown in the claims is related to the knowledge that they may be illegal in labeling..\nIt is self-evident that consumers won't buy products unless they perceive a need for them. It is also obvious that a product claimed to be effective in a troublesome condition (such as PMS) will sell much better than one advertised to relieve a supposed deficiency of a chemical (gamma-linolenic acid).\nAlthough Dr. Horrobin has claimed to have done sufficient research to establish that evening primrose oil is safe and effective against PMS and eczema, he has not gained FDA approval for marketing evening primrose oil products as drugs in the United States. Marketing them as \"food supplements\" is a transparent attempt to evade the food and drug laws.\nRegulatory Actions\nIn 1979, the FDA had notified Efamol representatives that EPO could not be imported into the United States unless the company sought and obtained approval by filing an appropriate food additive petition or new drug application. Efamol agreed not to export EPO to the United States, but in 1985 it began shipping it in bulk to California for encapsulation. The capsules would then be shipped to distributors who would market them as dietary supplements through health-food stores or by mail-order. In 1985, the FDA issued an Import Alert to detain EPO labeled for food use because the agency considered it an unsafe food additive.\nIn 1984, General Nutrition, Inc., three of its officers, and two of its retail store managers were charged with conspiring to defraud the FDA and violating provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which require that drug products be approved by the FDA as safe and effective prior to marketing. The indictment alleged:\nBetween 1980 and 1981, General Nutrition, its president (Gary Daum), and two vice-presidents conspired to purchase EPO from Efamol Ltd. and to promote and sell it under the name Gammaprim for the prevention and treatment of high blood pressure, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and other ailments.\nIn 1980, one of the defendants received a letter from Horrobin suggesting that Efamol products be marketed without FDA approval. Referring to EPO's supposed beneficial effects, the letter stated, \"Obviously you could not advertise Efamol for these purposes but equally obviously there are ways of getting the information across.\" Subsequent company memos described an elaborate promotional scheme that included newspaper articles, radio talk shows, and publications for use in General Nutrition's retail stores. In addition, oral claims were made by retail employees to prospective customers. FDA investigators posing as customers at various stores in western New York State were told that Gammaprim would be better for treatment of high blood pressure than the prescription drugs Nitrostat or Diuril, and that it was good for arthritis as well.\nBy virtue of these claims, Gammaprim became a drug within the meaning of the law. However, rather than submitting the product to the FDA for premarket evaluation, defendants sought to disguise it as a food supplement, thereby attempting to defraud the FDA [6].\nIn motions to stop the prosecution, the defendants claimed: (a) their right to free speech was being violated, (b) the prosecution was unfair because many other companies making health claims in advertising had not been criminally prosecuted, (c) Gammaprim should not be considered a drug because it is not inherently toxic, and (d) the laws under which they were being prosecuted were too vague. In 1986, these motions were dismissed by a federal judge who noted that the defendants were aware, or should have been aware, that they were breaking the law. A few months later, General Nutrition pled guilty to four counts of misbranding a drug and agreed to pay $10,000 to the government as reimbursement for costs of prosecution. Daum (who was no longer its president) pled guilty to one count of misbranding and was fined $1,000. The remaining charges against other employees were dismissed. Horrobin was not prosecuted ifor his role in the alleged conspiracy, but I believe he could have been.\nDuring 1988, FDA investigators who visited one pharmacy and several health-food stores were told by a salesperson that EPO was effective for PMS, arthritis, and/or eczema. The investigators were shown magazine articles or other literature containing claims of this type. During the same year, at the FDA's request, a U.S. marshal seized 21 barrels containing EPO and vitamin E, plus quantities of five Efamol products. In 1989, forty-five more barrels of EPO were seized en route to California for encapsulation. In both cases, the FDA charged that Efamol Ltd. was marketing an unapproved food additive. With respect to the products, the FDA also charged that they were unapproved new drugs and misbranded. Federal district judges agreed with the FDA and ordered the seized materials destroyed. Efamol's appeals all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court were unsuccessful.\nDuring these proceedings, Efamol Ltd. was compelled to produce documents which showed how it had spread therapeutic claims through press conferences, news releases, \"news bulletins\" to distributors, and many other channels of communication. Between 1983 and 1989, the company had issued more than 60 bulletins reporting on EPO research and other developments. Many were accompanied by reprints from scientific journals, newspapers, or magazines. A few were accompanied by a television transcript, booklet, or book. These materials promoted EPO for treating PMS, alcoholism, pregnancy-induced hypertension, atopic eczema, elevated cholesterol levels, hypertension, scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, mastalgia (breast pain) and other problems. The bulletins encouraged use of the information for public relations purposes. The company also published and distributed bibliographies of scientific publications relevant to EPO to health-food retailers throughout the United States. Some of the references in these bibliographies were emphasized by highlighted quotes -- including some from Dr. Horrobin's paper -- which made explicit therapeutic claims for Efamol's EPO. Some of the bulletins included a statement like, \"The way in which this information is used must, of course, be consistent with local regulations which generally do not permit direct medical claims in advertisements, etc.\" Most of these documents were included in the materials the FDA gave me to review.\nResearch Findings\nAt the time I did my FDA review, it appeared to me that more commercially-sponsored research had been done on evening primrose oil than on any other dietary supplement. But the situation also struck me as peculiar. If EPO were genuinely useful, why weren't there lots of independent studies? I also wondered whether any of the Horrobin's data were faked. Although I had no evidence that they were, his marketing strategies made me question his honesty. Distribution of his videotaped lecture to retailers about EPO was a criminal act, and his memo to GNC about \"obvious way of getting the message across\" made it clear that he clearly understood the law. Would someone that contemptuous of the law have any qualms about faking data? One instance of probable fraud in the early 1990s came to light when the British General Medical Counsel concluded that a neurophysiologist who studied the use of Efamol in diabetics had falsified data and been promised a royalty if the product were approved for drug use. However, the Council's report made no mention of Horrobin and concluded that this was an isolated incident that was motivated by misguided belief rather than financial considerations [7].\nAssuming that the research was all legitimate, was it reasonable to conclude that EPO safe and effective for any of its intended purposes or that EPO worked by correcting a \"GLA deficiency\"? In the early 1990s, Purdue University's Varro E. Tyler, Ph.D., a leading authority on plant medicines, looked very carefully at Horrobin's writings and concluded:\n[Horrobin's theories] would be valid only if all of the specified conditions are favorably influenced by additional production in the body of prostaglandin E1 and if a deficiency of GLA is the single factor responsible for limited prostaglandin production. Both of these factors remain unproven. If they are not true, then [assuming] that evening primrose oil [is effective] in such conditions is somewhat like assuming one's car will run better if the gas tank is completely full instead of half full. Some clinical evidence exists supporting the possible efficacy of evening primrose oil in the treatment of . . . PMS . . . sore breasts, multiple sclerosis, atopic eczema, various diabetes-associated problems, cardiovascular disease, and several other conditions. . . .However, the validity of some of the reports has been refuted or at least questioned. An Australian study . . . of evening primrose oil in treating women with moderate PMS concluded that the improvement was solely a placebo effect. . . . Furthermore, there are no data to support the safety of long-term consumption [8].\nIn 1993 and 2000, other reviewers looked at studies of evening primrose oil or borage oil (which contains higher concentrations of GLA) for eczema concluded that the largest and best of them did not show convincing evidence of any benefit [9,10]. In December 2003, the British Medical Journal reported a well-designed study of 140 eczema patients who took either a high dose of GLA or a placebo for 12 weeks showed no difference between the two groups [11]. The report was accompanied by an editorial [2] which stated that:\nHorrobin co-authored a 1989 meta-analysis that praised research sponsored by his company and unjustifiably criticized a large independent study that showed negative results.\nThe authors of negative study were unable to achieve publication of a well-reasoned defense of their study.\nA subsequent review with negative conclusions did not get published because Scotia threatened to sue if it were.\nIn 1995, the British Department of Health commissioned a meta-analysis of 20 studies, which included 10 unpublished studies held by the company. Although the report produced a relatively clear conclusion, the authors were not permitted to make it public.\nThe Health Technology Assessment systematic review published in 2000 provided an opportunity for the company to hand over its unpublished studies for inclusion in that report, but it did not do so.\nIn April 2003, the British Medical Journal published an obituary of Horrobin which charged that \"evening primrose oil . . . may go down in history as the remedy for which there is no disease, and David Horrobin . . . may prove to be the greatest snake oil salesman of his age.\"[12] The editorial triggered more than 100 angry responses from Horrobin's family, former business associates, scientists who described how Horrobin had been extremely kind and helpful to them, and others who said they had not known Horrobin but thought that the obituary showed extremely poor taste. None of the critics mentioned the improper marketing activities I have described in this report.\nReferences\n"}, {"score": 779.6859, "uuid": "d18758e7-15db-5922-a760-6a06ec1495e8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0211wb-13-26124", "target_hostname": "www.skintherapyletter.ca", "target_uri": "http://www.skintherapyletter.ca/stl/2006/11.1/1.html", "page_rank": 1.1890129e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "Skin Therapy Letter - Canada Edition: Etanercept for <em>the</em> Treatment of <em>Psoriasis</em>", "snippet": "<em>The</em> rate of serious infections did not increase over time, and there was no significant <em>difference</em> between <em>what</em> had been observed in <em>the</em> etanercept group <em>vs</em>. <em>the</em> placebo-treated patients, as well as cohorts of patients with RA.", "explanation": null, "document": "Etanercept for the Treatment of Psoriasis\nR. Bissonnette MD, FRCPC\nInnovaderm Research, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\nABSTRACT\nEtanercept has recently been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis at a dose of 50mg twice per week for 12 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 50mg once weekly thereafter. Clinical studies have shown excellent efficacy and a good safety profile in patients with psoriasis. Extensive information on etanercept safety is available as this biological agent has been used for many years for other indications such as rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis.\nKey Words: etanercept, plaque psoriasis, Enbrel\u00ae, psoriatic arthritis\nEtanercept (Enbrel\u00ae, Amgen/Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) is a fusion protein with affinity for soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and has been US FDA approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) since 1998. This biologic treatment is currently approved in several countries, including recent approval in Canada, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The approved dosage for treatment of psoriasis is 50mg subcutaneous (SC) twice per week for 3 months followed by 50mg once per week thereafter. This dosage regimen is different from the dose commonly used to treat RA, which is 25mg SC twice weekly.\nCurrent Therapies for Psoriasis\nCurrent treatment options for mild psoriasis include topical treatments such as calcipotriol, corticosteroids, and tar. For patients with more severe or extensive disease, phototherapy, including narrow band UVB and PUVA, has been shown to be very effective. Patients with severe and/or extensive disease, disease unresponsive to topical treatment and phototherapy, or disease that has a severe impact on quality of life, such as hand or foot involvement, are usually candidates for systemic therapy.\nThe three most frequently used oral medications for psoriasis in North America are methotrexate, acitretin, and cyclosporine. Biologics are a new therapeutics class for the treatment of psoriasis, and three agents are currently approved in the US and Canada for the treatment of psoriasis: alefacept (Amevive\u00ae, Biogen Idec), efalizumab (Raptiva\u00ae, Serono and Genentech/Xoma), and etanercept (Enbrel\u00ae, Amgen/Wyeth Pharaceuticals). This article will review safety and efficacy of etanercept in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.\nEfficacy of Etanercept in the Treatment of Psoriasis\nPASI (Psoriasis area severity index) is the primary endpoint used in studies assessing the efficacy of biologics for the treatment of psoriasis. PASI takes into account the extent of the disease, as well as the severity of erythema, scaling, and thickness in different body areas affected by psoriasis. Clinical improvement in biologics trials for psoriasis is usually reported as PASI-50 or PASI-75. A PASI-75 represents an improvement in the PASI score of at least 75% as compared with baseline (i.e., before the biologic was administered).\nEtanercept at a dose of 50mg SC twice per week has been shown to induce a PASI-75 response in 49% of patients after 12 weeks.1,2 Papp, et al. reduced the dose to 25mg twice per week for an additional 12 weeks and found that the percentage of patients exhibiting a PASI-75 response increased to 54%.2 In this study, 23% of patients lost their PASI-75 response when the etanercept dose was lowered to 25mg twice weekly; however, only 3% of these patients lost their PASI-50 response.2 Despite lowering the dose after 12 weeks, 32% of patients who did not reached PASI-75 at week 12 reached PASI-75 at week 24.2 Studies conducted with 25mg of etanercept twice weekly for 6 months (the last 3 months being open-label) demonstrated that 42%-44% of patients reached PASI-75 at week 24.1,2\nStudies were also conducted where etanercept was stopped after 3 months of continuous treatment to determine if this would lead to a rebound phenomenon, as this can be seen with other systemic agents used to treat psoriasis. Rebound was defined as an increase in PASI of at least 25% compared with baseline, or an erythrodermic, pustular, or severe inflammatory flare within 12 weeks of treatment cessation. Of the 409 patients studied, only one etanercept treated patient presented with an increase of PASI of more than 25% above baseline.3 This patient received a lower starting dose of etanercept (i.e., 25 mg weekly.) No cases or erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis were reported, suggesting that etanercept can be safely stopped.\nIn the same study etanercept was reintroduced when the disease relapsed, and the PASI-75 response was assessed following retreatment. The percentage of patients achieving a PASI-75 response was the same after retreatment as that seen in patients who received etanercept for the first time.3 These studies suggest that etanercept can be stopped and reinitiated without the induction of rebound or loss of clinical response.\nEtanercept has also been shown to reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis and has been approved in the US since June 2002 and in Canada since Jan 2004 for this indication.4 Etanercept should be considered as a treatment option in patients with both plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis.\nMechanism of Action\nEtanercept binds soluble TNF-a, thus preventing its interaction with TNF-a cell surface receptors. This inhibits the effects of TNF-a in the skin, such as the release of proinflammatory cytokines by keratinocytes and lymphocytes, as well as the increase in expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells. This mechanism seems to differ from some of the other TNF-a antagonists that have an affinity for soluble as well as membrane bound TNF therefore enabling cell lysis following interaction with TNF-a.5,6\nAdverse Events\nThe current information on etanercept safety comes from clinical studies conducted in patients with various diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, RA, ankylosing spondylitis, and juvenile arthritis as well as from post-marketing experience. To date it is estimated that more than 337,000 patients worldwide, including over 74,000 patients with psoriasis, have received etanercept. Clinical studies are ideal to study the incidence and severity of frequent side-effects but are usually not powerful enough to assess less frequent adverse events. For example, clinical studies conducted with etanercept have given precise information on injection site reactions but cannot adequately assess the incidence of less frequent events such as serious infections.\nThe most commonly reported adverse event is injection site reactions, which occurred in 14%-20% of patients in psoriasis studies.1 These are characterized by erythema and edema at injection sites and are usually mild.\nSerious infections, sometimes resulting in death, have been reported in patients treated with all anti-TNFa agents including etanercept. In patients with psoriasis who participated in placebo-controlled studies, the number of serious infections per patient per year was similar in patients treated with placebo and patients treated with etanercept.1,2 In an ongoing long-term, open-label study of patients treated with etanercept for RA, there was no increase in serious infections.7 There were 1272 patients with either early RA or long-standing RA enrolled in this trial, with some having received continuous etanercept for more than 8 years. The rate of serious infections did not increase over time, and there was no significant difference between what had been observed in the etanercept group vs. the placebo-treated patients, as well as cohorts of patients with RA. The exact role of etanercept in these serious infections is currently unknown.\nCases of demyelinating disorders have been reported in patients treated with anti-TNFa, including etanercept. A study conducted in the past with another anti-TNFa agent (lenercept), used to treat patients with multiple sclerosis, was stopped because of worsening of the disease under study.8 Cases of new onset multiple sclerosis, exacerbation of established multiple sclerosis, as well as optic neuritis and myelitis have been reported in patients treated with anti-TNFa agents, including etanercept.9 Some of these cases were reversible upon cessation of etanercept whereas others were not. In an ongoing long-term, open-label study in patients with RA, two cases of MS were reported.7 The causality of etanercept in these events as well as the exact risk of demyelinating disease with etanercept is unknown.\nPatients with active tuberculosis should not be initiated on anti-TNFa agents. Cases of reactivation of latent TB have been reported with anti-TNFa agents, including etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab.10 Most cases were reported from patients treated with anti-TNFa antibodies as opposed to the etanercept fusion protein. The current US and Canadian monographs do not require TB screening before initiating etanercept,9,11 but many physicians currently prefer to perform a purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD) skin test and/or a chest X-ray. This should at least be considered for patients at higher risk of TB including patients coming from countries where TB is more frequent.\nClinical trials with etanercept, including a long-term, open-label RA trial, have not shown that patients are at higher risk of solid tumors.7 Cases of lymphoma were reported in patients treated with etanercept.7 In a long-term, open-label RA study, four cases of lymphoma were reported in patients with early RA and 7 cases in patients with long-standing RA when the expected number, based on the SEER database, were 0.8 and 1.1, respectively.7 These data should be interpreted with caution as patients with RA are at higher risk of developing lymphoma, and the risk increases with severity of the disease.12,13 It is currently unknown if the lymphoma cases seen in etanercept treated patients represent the fact that severe patients with RA are more at risk of lymphoma than the general population, or if etanercept has a role in the genesis of lymphomas. Interestingly patients with psoriasis (not treated with biologics) have also been reported to have an increased risk of lymphoma.14\nCases of an increase in pre-existing as well as new onset congestive heart failure (CHF) have been reported.9 The role of etanercept in these cases is unknown. Two clinical trials that were designed to assess the safety and efficacy of etanercept in the treatment of CHF were stopped because of lack of efficacy.9\nAdverse Events\n"}, {"score": 772.15564, "uuid": "8e22fed8-c8d2-5171-8a29-196814cae6d8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0400wb-80-28712", "target_hostname": "health.mweb.co.za", "target_uri": "http://health.mweb.co.za/mind/CBT/1284-4897,66352.asp", "page_rank": 1.1712837e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "<em>What</em> <em>is</em> CBT?: Health24: Psychology", "snippet": "<em>The</em> primary <em>difference</em> between CBT and other psychotherapeutic models <em>is</em> based on <em>the</em> notion that emotional and behavioural disturbance <em>is</em> essentially driven by <em>the</em> way in which we think about that with which we are confronted.", "explanation": null, "document": "Check out our step-by-step guides\nWeekly Poll\nHow would you describe your first aid knowledge?\nI don't know anything\nI vaguely remember some things\nI know at least one technique\nI know the basics\nI have a qualification in first aid\nGeneral Newsletter\nYOU ARE IN > Mind > CBT\nWhat is CBT?\nThis article is part of our introductory series on cognitive-behaviour therapy .\nThe idea that our thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs have a profound influence on the way we feel and react to what life throws at us has been around for centuries; since the early Greek philosophers. The scientific discipline of psychology has, however, only recently given attention to this phenomenon as a means of understanding and treating psychological problems.\nWhile the initial psychological theory of human emotion and behaviour (originally based on the work of Sigmund Freud) certainly made significant contributions toward the development of the profession, few theoretical frameworks have had as significant an impact on the treatment of psychological distress as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT).\nThe primary difference between CBT and other psychotherapeutic models is based on the notion that emotional and behavioural disturbance is essentially driven by the way in which we think about that with which we are confronted.\nThe fictitious scenario below provides an example of the type of thinking that would typically be associated with depressed mood.\nCase study\nJoe fails his economics exam and thinks \u201cI am such a failure; I\u2019ll never manage to get through this degree; the rest of my life is ruined\u201d. As a result, Joe (1) feels depressed, (2) withdraws himself, (3) renders himself helpless and his situation hopeless and (4) drops out prematurely from his studies.\nAlternatively, if Joe was able to think in a more helpful and realistic manner and consider the following thoughts such as, \u201coh well, I failed, but then who hasn\u2019t? This is a real inconvenience, but is it really a catastrophe? I could certainly learn from my mistakes and try again; this isn\u2019t the only thing I can study or do with my life\u201d, then he\u2019d be more likely to (1) feel sad or disappointed but not feel depressed, (2) not withdraw himself or (3) not give up prematurely.\nHis disappointment would be considered healthy and may actually help motivate him to try harder next time. This fictitious account provides for a typical example of how our emotional and behavioural reactions to difficult circumstances are determined to a large degree by the way in which we think about our circumstances, and not merely by those circumstances themselves. In other words, Joe\u2019s emotional and behavioural reaction is determined by how he thinks about the fact that he failed, and not solely his failure.\nEmotional responsibility\nCBT theory proposes that if we are able to identify those thinking and behavioural patterns that are contributing toward our distress, restructure and alter these, then one would be better equipped to reduce or eliminate psychological distress. The CBT model thus encourages \u201cemotional responsibility\u201d by encouraging individuals to identify and alter the way in which they think so as to feel and react in a more appropriate way. This also provides for a more optimistic view regarding the potential for human beings to alter their emotional and behavioural reactions to difficult circumstances. The model proposes that individuals can effectively and successfully influence their own emotional well-being, irrespective of the situation with which they are confronted.\nCBT is practical, goal-orientated and based on objective, measurable concepts that have been verified scientifically (empirically). For instance, behaviour can be observed, measured and studied, as can thought, which we are typically able to articulate through language. Scientific investigation has shown that our thoughts are very much associated with our emotional states and behavioural reactions and that\u00a0 restructuring of our thoughts typically alters the way we feel. Thousands of well designed, peer-reviewed research papers have verified the central tenets of CBT.\nCBT-based intervention is based on what we now know works regarding the treatment of a wide variety of psychological disorders. There is ample scientific evidence that CBT is effective in the treatment of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, interpersonal problems, eating disorders, substance-related problems, psychotic disorders, impulse control disorders, insomnia and behavioural problems.

In most cases, this method of assigning gender at birth fits the person without any problems. However, a person\u2019s gender is actually quite complicated and as a result this simple method of assigning gender doesn\u2019t always work.\nA small number of people find the gender they are assigned does not match their gender identity - that is, their internal sense of where they exist in relation to being boys/men or girls/women .\nA wide variety of terms can be used to describe a person whose gender identity is different from their birth gender label. In some countries, it is currently common to use the term transgender people as an \u2018umbrella term\u2019 to cover these many diverse labels. However, it is important not to end up overlooking the huge diversity in identity, experiences and concerns between the various types of transgender people.\nNot sexual orientation\nPut simply: gender refers to who you are, while sexual orientation refers to who you are attracted to.\nTransgender people can be straight, gay or bisexual just the same as everyone else.\nMale-to-female transsexual women can be described as straight if they are attracted to men, lesbian if they are attracted to women or bisexual if they are attracted to both men and women. Likewise, female-to-male transsexual men can be described as straight if they are attracted to women, gay if they are attracted to men or bisexual if they are attracted to both men and women.\nDifferent to intersexed\nSometimes a baby\u2019s external genitals, their internal reproductive system or their chromosomes are in between what is considered clearly male or female. People born with these kinds of variations are often referred to as intersex people and there are many different intersex conditions.\nThe issues faced by intersex people can sometimes be similar to those faced by transgender people. For example: both intersex and transgender people might face being labelled by others as a gender that doesn\u2019t match their gender identity. Also, both may perhaps undergo hormone treatment or surgical procedures in order to bring their physical appearance more closely into alignment with their gender identity.\nHowever, there are also very significant differences between the experiences of transgender people and intersex people so it is important not to get intersex and transgender confused with each other.\n- Adapted from Gender Identity - An Information Booklet For Transgender People In Scotland and Their Families and Friends\nRead more:\n"}, {"score": 762.82623, "uuid": "382a5bb0-953d-500a-9fdb-ed8ed4e07465", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1800tw-48-18650", "target_hostname": "www.glutenfreesociety.org", "target_uri": "http://www.glutenfreesociety.org/videotutorials/what-is-gluten-sensitivity-an-easy-explanation-to-avoid-all-the-confusion/", "page_rank": 1.2201058e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "<em>What</em> <em>is</em> Gluten Sensitivity?", "snippet": "November 18, 2011 <em>What</em> <em>is</em> Gluten Sensitivity?

In recent years, many road running shoe brands have started exhibiting at OR as well. Saucony, Books and New Balance were there, for example, and while the Asics folks didn\u2019t have a booth on the show floor, they were taking media appointments. The biggest question running brands \u2013trail or road- are trying to answer is, what is a trail shoe?\nIs a trail shoe an Asics GT-2120 Trail or Brooks Adrenaline ASR , which are very similar to their road sibling, or is a trail runner an aggressively outsoled, low profile shoe without any stability features, such as the New Balance 800 or Nike Air Zoom Kyotee ? Most manufacturers and retailers I\u2019ve spoken with agree that a true trail shoe is built low to the ground with deep lugs for traction and has an upper designed to wrap the foot while protecting it from trail debris. These shoes allow the body to do what it has evolved to do in response to uneven trail conditions.\nOne thing I need to be clear about is what I mean when I say, trail. A fire road or cinder path isn\u2019t a trail. It\u2019s not paved, sure, but the movement your foot goes through is similar to what it would do on the roads. These are the surfaces most of us run on. I\u2019m no exception, our local \u201ctrail\u201d is a 10k cinder loop called the Little Lehigh Parkway. This is the place the 2120 and Adrenaline do best.

Posted in Articles\nPop quiz! What is the difference between food intolerance, food allergy and food sensitivity?\u00a0 If you don\u2019t know, read on. If you do, then read on as well.\nFood Intolerance\nFood intolerance is simply a bad or negative reaction from the gastrointestinal (\u201cGI\u201d) tract and does not involve the immune system at all.\u00a0 Usually caused by the body\u2019s inability to digest a certain food (that is, when the body is deficient in one or more enzymes), the GI tract ends up producing symptoms like gas, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea and/ or indigestion.\u00a0 The reaction may be instant or it could take up to 30 minutes or more to occur depending on the level of the intolerance.\nFood Allergies\nUnlike food intolerance, a food allergy can be quite severe and DOES involve the body\u2019s immune system.\u00a0 In order for the immune system to get involved, food particles must somehow enter the bloodstream through any food-exposed surface in the GI tract.\u00a0 First off, to understand this concept, you must be aware that your GI tract is simply a tube from your mouth to your anus and therefore is an EXTERNAL environment.\u00a0 If any part of the GI tract is not healthy, food can pass through tiny perforations in the intestinal lining and enter the bloodstream.\u00a0 When this happens, the immune system immediately notices a foreign substance (food) WITHIN the body and starts sending \u2018troops\u2019 to attack, immobilize and destroy the foreign substance.\u00a0 After the food particles are destroyed, the immune system \u2018memorizes\u2019 the food in order for the attack to occur more quickly and with more force every time the specific food object is detected in the bloodstream.\u00a0 This is why people with serious food allergies tend to have stronger and more severe allergic reactions every subsequent time that they eat the food that they are allergic to.\u00a0 Though food allergies can be quite severe and potentially fatal in some situations, the reactions are fairly acute and usually are limited to few foods like nuts and seeds (although other food types can also cause allergic reactions).\nFood Sensitivities\nLast but not least, food sensitivities \u2013 the most common of the three.\u00a0 Food sensitivities are usually chronic conditions with symptoms that include headaches, diarrhea, respiratory congestion (mucus/phlegm), fatigue, brain \u2018fog\u2019, body pain as well as several other unpleasant symptoms..\u00a0 Similar to food intolerances, the immune system is not involved with food sensitivities and food sensitivities may take up to several days or more to present symptoms.\u00a0 Because of this delay, they are usually unnoticed by the individual, especially since most of the symptoms are mistakenly associated with causes \u00a0other than food.\u00a0 You might think that food sensitivities should be the lesser of the three \u2018evils\u2019 listed in this article, however, this is not true.\u00a0 There is a huge movement which believes that food sensitivities are actually the cause of many chronic conditions like migraines, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, eczema, psoriasis, arthritis and a host of others.\nIn all three cases, the best solution is to find out whether or not certain foods could be causing your current health conditions or making the situation worse.\u00a0 Meridian Stress Assessment (MSA) is one excellent way for you to find out what types of foods are causing imbalance within your organ systems and help you determine an optimal diet plan based on your unique situation.\u00a0 Give us a call today to book your appointment.\nSo, did you pass the quiz?\u00a0 Congratulations if you did, but don\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t \u2013 the important thing to know is that you have got a Team of experts at Inspired Life Health Centre ready to help when you need it.\nCopyright \u00a9 Inspired Life Health Centre Inc.\nReproduction of this document or any portion thereof without prior written consent is prohibited.\nTrackback from your site.\nEnter your email address below to receive weekly health articles directly in your inbox.\n*We promise to never rent, sell or trade your email with any other organization.\nNew Product\nInspired Life Health Centre is located in the Heart of Toronto on Danforth Avenue in The Carrot Common .\nWe take pride in providing the highest quality of service, compassion and professionalism to our clients and customers.\nCopyright \u00a9 2005-2011 Inspired Life Health Centre Inc.

Drugs may be prescribed temporarily, or as a last resort solution.\nNaturopathic medicine is a distinct form of primary health care. True licensed \u201cNaturopathic Physicians\u201d have completed eight years of medical training along with a two year medical internship. Naturopathic physicians are primary health care practitioners, whose diverse techniques include both modern and traditional methods of treatment.\nThe principles of naturopathic medicine are part of what distinguishes the naturopathic approach to health care from the conventional approach; and are based on objective observation of the nature of health and disease. The following principles are the foundation of naturopathic medical practice:\nThe Healing Power of Nature Vis Medicatrix Naturae\nNaturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self healing process in the body which is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to recovery and to facilitate and augment this healing ability\nFirst Do No Harm Primum Non Nocere\nNaturopathic medicine follows three principles to avoid harming the patient: 1) utilize methods and medical substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects; 2) avoid, when possible, the harmful suppression of symptoms; 3) acknowledge and respect the individual\u2019s healing process, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat illness\nFind the Cause Tolle Causam\nUnderlying causes of illness must be identified and removed before complete recovery can occur. The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than to eliminate or merely suppress symptoms\nTreat the Whole Person\nNaturopathic physicians treat each individual by taking into account physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development.\nPrevention\nNaturopathic physicians emphasize disease prevention, assessment of risk factors and hereditary susceptibility to disease and making appropriate interventions to prevent illness. Naturopathic medicine strives to create a healthy world in which humanity may thrive\nDoctor as Teacher (Docere)\nThe original meaning of the word \u201cdoctor\u201d is teacher. One of the main objectives of naturopathic medicine is to educate the patient and emphasize self \u2013responsibility for health. Naturopathic physicians also acknowledge the therapeutic value of the doctor-patient relationship.\nWellness\nWellness follows the establishment and maintenance of optimum health and balance. Wellness is a state of being healthy, characterized by positive emotion, thought and action. Wellness is inherent in everyone, no matter what des-ease(s) is/are being experienced. If wellness is really recognized and experienced by and individual, it will more quickly heal a given dis-ease than direct treatment of the dis-ease alone.

Maybe Not\nOctober 7, 2011 6:04 am\nTweet\nImmediately on the heels of the IAAF's controversial decision to set aside women's world records set in mixed-gender races, a well-known group of South African researchers has published a study designed to determine if pacing helps runners perform better. The group hypothesized that the answer would be yes. Their results did not confirm this. Instead, pacers had a nonsignficant effect on the 5K race times of the primary subjects.\nThe study was interesting, though fraught by methodology issues that make its conclusion questionable, as even the authors acknowledge. The conditions seemed quite different from those in the real world of \"rabbit-led\" races. The study was published in the International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance with the title: \"The Effect of a Second Runner on Pacing Strategy and RPE during a Running Time Trial.\"\nHere's what happened, brief as I can tell it. Eleven club runners with 5K times around 20 minutes ran five different 5K time trials over about a three-week period. They did the first and last entirely on their own. For the middle three time trials, there was a second runner on the indoor track. These second runners were capable of 5Ks in about 18 minutes (they were faster than the first guys). The primary subjects weren't told who the second runners were, or why they had joined the experiment. The mystery runners just showed up and joined the time trial.\nSo the pacers ran the middle three of the five trials. They were instructed to run slightly ahead of the first runner in one trial, slightly behind in another, and at the first runner's side in the third.\nThe researchers believed \"that the presence of a second runner would alter the pacing strategy\" of the primary subjects. They explained: \"The inclusion of a second runner in the current study was intended to present an external factor that would increase the motivation of the athlete.\" Maybe it did or didn't, but the results showed no significant change. The primary subjects ran roughly the same in all five time-trials, starting too fast, slowing gradually through the middle miles, and then speeding up slightly toward the end. A typical pattern, in other words.\nThe results showed no significant differences between trials for performance, heart rate, or perceived exertion. All 11 of the primary subjects said they believed the pacers had helped them run faster, but the results (below) didn't support this. Hence the research team concluded: \"These findings indicate that an athlete's subconscious pacing strategy is robust,\" i.e., not easy to change, and not helped by another nearby runner.\nBelow are the average times for the 11 runners in the five trial conditions. Apparently, a statistical analysis yielded the result of no significant differences. But looking at this chart, most of us would choose to have a pacer in front of us.\nThe researchers note that their experiment did not duplicate real-world racing conditions. In the real world, elite runners are provided with known pacers, told what pace these rabbits will be attempting to hit, and told that the pacers exist to help them, the elites, achieve their best efforts. In this trial, the pacers were a surprise addition to the experiment, and the primary subjects were given no instruction about who the pacers were, or what pace strategy they would follow. Perhaps a pacer is only useful if you know he or she is a \"good pacer\" rather than a \"mystery pacer.\"\nOr maybe pacers really and truly don't help. The problem with this notion is that it flies in the face of real-world experience, and many experts believe that real-world elite athletes and coaches are way ahead of the scientists trying to understand them.\nCONDITION\n"}, {"score": 558.7082, "uuid": "d07fd9cd-eccb-52d7-9925-b9c9856deb8a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1314wb-01-21804", "target_hostname": "www.health24.com", "target_uri": "http://www.health24.com/fitness/Lifestages/16-480-511,11509.asp", "page_rank": 1.1713736e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "No <em>difference</em> in exercise for men and women: Health24: Fitness", "snippet": "<em>The</em> main <em>difference</em> between men and women <em>is</em> that women can give birth to children.

Other than pelvic and carrying angles, men and women are structured very similarly.\nThe biggest difference between the sexes is physiological: the ability to generate power in the muscles (muscle fibres). This power generation has no significance, however, for the average individual who wants to exercise to keep fit and healthy.\nThe principles of training are the same for men and women. The training principles for men and women are universal regardless of the training programme.\nMen and women evaluated equally\nAccording to sport scientists from The American College of Sports Medicines, an exercise programme for a man or women is determined by an evaluation of the individual\u0092s response to exercise. This evaluation includes observations of heart rate, blood pressure, subjective response to exercise and functional capacity measured during a graded exercise test.\nMyths about women lifting weights\nMany women believe lifting weights will transform themselves into Amazons with big, highly defined muscles. This is a myth and misconception, as very few women actually have the exceedingly rare gene that will allow them to develop large, defined muscles. Only several women out of 10 000 could ever develop the appearance of a top bodybuilder, so becoming too big and muscular should not be a for the majority of women.\nHigh intensity training best\nThe second misconception is that \u0093toning\u0094 in women is synonymous with a large amount of aerobic training, which is presumed to keep the individual \u0093small\u0094, control weight and maintain fitness. This regime has no scientific basis, however. The idea of toning seems to involve not putting in much effort (intensity), but rather doing a great deal of work (volume) \u0096 many sets, many repetitions.\nThis has been known to be an ineffective training method for 50 years.\nLower-intensity toning does not work the muscle fibres adequately, only working the slow-twitch fibres. It is ineffective and a total waste of time. One set of high intensity exercise is more effective. This is where a high degree of effort, although not necessarily a great deal of weight is required.\nHigh intensity training is the surest way for men and women to effectively weight train and this is incompatible with high volume (doing lots of sets) and high frequency. Usually in training, more is not better, it\u0092s worse.\nLow Aerobic training low in burning calories\nLower to moderate-intensity aerobic training has been shown to be low in \u0093burning\u0094 calories and does virtually nothing for your cardiovascular fitness. Therefore intensity seems to be the key factor again.\nSafely and progressively training at 75-85 percent and occasionally 90 percent of your maximum heart rate (which is 220 minus your age) can do a great deal to increase a woman\u0092s fitness and the rate of caloric expenditure is high.\nAn interesting theory proposes that if a woman and a man train for the same period and at the same intensity that will allow them to run a 20-hour marathon, they will finish in the same time. A great example of this was when Frith van der Merwe ran the comrades in under six hours thereby finishing in the top 20 of all the finishers.\nIts plain and simple, men and women can exercise on the same planet. There is no difference in the principles of exercising programs for men and women and both can exercise at the same intensity for the same duration. So woman can train like men and be as fit as men with out the bulging muscles to match, writes Prusad.\nAny exercise better than nothing\nBut any exercise is better than nothing.

The nonpruritic, violaceous, annular, and erythematous plaques were diagnosed as tinea corporis and clotrimizol antifungal cream was prescribed. The rash persisted despite 2 weeks of treatment and the patient was referred to a dermatologist.\nA biopsy from the lesion on the hand was consistent with features of localized granuloma annulare. The patient was reassured that the condition was self-limiting. The lesion on her calf, however, grew larger and new nummular and annular plaques developed that ultimately involved her legs, arms, abdomen, and back.\nA new diagnosis was made of generalized granuloma annulare. During the next 2-and-a-half years, the patient received numerous systemic and topical treatments with little improvement in symptoms. Treatments included: topical corticosteroids, intralesional and intramuscular injections of triamcinolone(Drug information on triamcinolone) , biotin (vitamin H, coenzyme R), hydroxychloroquine(Drug information on hydroxychloroquine) , quinacrine, pentoxifylline(Drug information on pentoxifylline) , and dapsone(Drug information on dapsone) . She is currently receiving treatment with methotrexate(Drug information on methotrexate) and folic acid(Drug information on folic acid) , although the response has been poor.\nTinea corporis and granuloma annulare are commonly seen in primary care practice. They have similar presentations, and subtle differences, and so are often misdiagnosed. A missed or erroneous diagnosis can lead to initial treatment failure and/or unnecessary therapy.\nTinea corporis\u2014a dermatophyte infection\u2014 manifests on the trunk and extremities (excluding the hair, nails, palms, soles, and groin) and often mimics benign inflammatory skin conditions, such as granuloma annulare. Tinea is generally limited to the stratum corneum and is most commonly caused by Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes.1 The infection can be transmitted from human to human, from animal to human, and from soil to human.2\nTinea corporis typically presents as an annular erythematous plaque with a raised leading edge and scale. Clearance occurs in the center of the lesion; however, residual nodules may be scattered throughout the infected area. This creates the characteristic annular plaque that gives the disease its common name, \u201cringworm.\u201d Tinea lesions also can appear as arcuate, circinate, and oval.2\nWhen you suspect tinea corporis infection, scrape the periphery of lesions to harvest surface scale for a KOH preparation. Fungal cultures on Sabouraud's agar medium may also be used to confirm the diagnosis.3\nTopical azole creams\u2014clotrimizole or miconazole\u2014are first line therapy for tinea corporis. Second-line topical therapies include terbinafine(Drug information on terbinafine) 1% cream, ciclopirox(Drug information on ciclopirox) , and 40% urea(Drug information on urea) cream.4\nGranuloma annulare is a benign inflammation that classically presents with 1 or more indurated, erythematous or violaceous annular plaques on the extremities. Unlike tinea corporis, scale is absent and the lesion may or may not be pruritic. Although its etiology is unknown, 4 clinical variants have been identified:\n\u2022 Localized\n\u2022 Subcutaneous\n\u2022 Perforating\nWhile diagnosis can be made based on visual examination, definitive diagnosis requires skin biopsy. Lesions are histologically characterized by necrobiotic collagen(Drug information on collagen) surrounded by a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. Based on the T-cell subpopulations identified in the infiltrate, a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to an unknown antigen has been postulated as the precipitating event. Factors suspected in triggering granuloma annulare include trauma, insect bite reactions, tuberculin skin testing, sun exposure, PUVA therapy, and viral infections.(1)\nFigure 1\nThe localized form of granuloma annulare usually resolves spontaneously, generally running a course of up to 2 years,5 with no long-term sequelae. Reassurance is usually all that is necessary. Treatment options include intralesional or topical corticosteroids and cryotherapy. However, granuloma annulare may progress from localized disease to the disseminated form, as was the case with the patient in this case history.\nDisseminated granuloma annulare may be persistent, lasting for as few as 3 years but in some cases up to 10 years.5 Patients often seek active treatment for cosmetic reasons, often with disappointing results. Current treatment guidelines suggest a wide range of possibilities: PUVA with oral or topical psoralens, UVA alone, etretinate and isotretinoin(Drug information on isotretinoin) , topical tacrolimus, dapsone, cyclosporine, systemic corticosteroids, chlorambucil(Drug information on chlorambucil) , antimalarials, potassium iodide(Drug information on potassium iodide) , pentoxifylline, nicotinamide(Drug information on nicotinamide) (niacinamide), topical vitamin E(Drug information on vitamin e) , fumaric acid esters, defibrotide, doxycycline(Drug information on doxycycline) , hydroxyurea, and pulsed dye laser.3\nMany reports supporting or refuting the association of granuloma annulare with diabetes mellitus have been published.(1) In one retrospective study of 84 patients, 12% were found to have diabetes mellitus, and these patients were more likely to suffer from chronic relapsing granuloma annulare than were non-diabetic patients.6 Therefore, in patients presenting with granuloma annulare screening for diabetes mellitus should be considered.\nGranuloma annulare has also been associated with solid organ tumors, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and therefore has been considered to be a paraneoplastic reaction. However, in these patients the clinical presentation is frequently atypical, with painful lesions in unusual locations, including the palms and soles.1\nFigure 2\nOther diagnostic considerations\nOther less common annular skin conditions that should be considered in a differential diagnosis include7:\n\u2022 Pityriasis rosea, a self limited papulosquamous skin eruption, is characterized by small, fawn-colored lesions distributed along skin cleavage lines. The \u201cherald patch\u201d may appear as an annular lesion with an erythematous, raised border, fine scale and central clearing.\n\u2022 Urticaria may present at non-scaling annular plaques and is characterized by pruritic, well circumscribed erythematous lesions that last between 90 minutes and 25 hours.\n\u2022 Cutaneous sarcoidosis is an idiopathic, multisystem granulomatous disease that is characterized by non-caseating granuloma formation in virtually any organ system. Sarcoidosis may present as coalescing papules forming annular, indurated plaques.\n\u2022 Hansen\u2019s disease (leprosy) is transmitted by the acid-fast bacillus Mycobacterium leprosae. It may present as one or more annular, sometimes scaly, plaques that may lack sensation.\n\u2022 Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus can present in annular or papulosquamous form. Photosensitivity is a hallmark, and lesions usually present on sun exposed areas of the skin.\n\u2022 Erythema annulare centrifugum typically presents as non-indurated annular patches with associated trailing scale inside erythematous borders. The lesions most commonly affect the trunk, buttocks, thighs, and legs.\n\u2022 Erythema chronicum migrans is the cutaneous hallmark of Lyme disease. It is characterized by large erythematous patches that may appear anywhere on the surface of the skin. The lesions expand centrifugally and have central clearing leading to annular erythematous patches.\n\u2022 Nummular eczema is associated with xerosis and is characterized by coin-shaped erythematous papules or plaques most commonly on the legs. Sometimes the lesions expand with central clearing, giving rise to annular plaques.\n\u2022 Psoriasis is most commonly found on extensor surfaces and is characterized by erythematous thick plaques with silvery scale. However, psoriasis can arise as annular lesions with silvery scale only on the borders.\nTeaching Points:\n\u2022 Tinea corporis and granuloma annulare have similar presentations and subtle differences, and so are often misdiagnosed.\n\u2022 Tinea corporis typically presents as an annular erythematous plaque with a raised leading edge and scale. Diagnosis is confirmed with KOH preparation or fungal culture.\n\u2022 Granuloma annulare classically presents with 1 or more indurated, erythematous or violaceous annular plaques on the extremities. Diagnosis is confirmed by skin biopsy.\nJoin the Conversation\nWant to join the conversation? If you're a healthcare professional, we'd like to hear your comments.

FIR heat is completely healthy and safe for all living things.\nThe sun emits the following types of rays:\u00a0 visible light rays; infrared rays; ultraviolet rays A, B and C (UVA, UVB, and UVC); radio waves; and soft and hard X-rays (gamma rays).\u00a0 The FIR heat is the equivalent to the infrared rays emitted from the sun.\nAll life requires FIR heat from the sun.\u00a0 FIR heat is not ultraviolet radiation but a narrow band of energy within the 5.6 to 15 micron level.\u00a0 This type of energy travels 2\"-3\" deep into the body to increase circulation and nourish damaged tissue.\u00a0\u00a0 This naturally occurring energy heats objects by direct light conversion (DLC).\u00a0 DLC warms only the object and does not raise the temperature of the surrounding free air.\u00a0 The FIR heat rays warm the body directly.\u00a0 The body then absorbs as much as 93% of the heat generated by this healing energy.\nWhat is the difference between traditional steam heat therapy and FIR heat therapy?\nInfrared heat warms the body in the same manner as natural sunlight.\u00a0 FIR heat therapy uses the wavelength of the visible and non-visible light spectrum of sunlight that heats the body normally.\u00a0 For example, traditional steam heat therapy, such as that found in saunas, raises the temperature of the air to a very high level within the chamber to warm the body.\u00a0 Have you ever had difficulty breathing in a steam sauna?! FIR heat therapy works differently.\u00a0 Instead of heating the air within the enclosure, FIR heat therapy heats the body directly.\u00a0 The result is deeper tissue penetration.\u00a0 In a FIR sauna, the body perspires and receives all of the health benefits but avoids the harmful and scorching hot air of a traditional steam sauna.\u00a0 The infrared energy applied in high quality FIR saunas may induce up to 2-3 times the sweat volume of a traditional hot-air sauna while operating at a significantly cooler air temperature range of 110F to 130F vs. 180F to 235F for traditional hot-air saunas.\nDr. Roshiko Yamazaki, M.D. owns a clinic in Japan where she has done extensive research on the therapeutic uses of FIR.\u00a0 She explains that one of the reasons FIR has beneficial results in a variety of illnesses is the ability of FIR waves to remove toxins, which are often at the core of many health problems.\u00a0 Since humans are bio-accumulators, toxins that cannot be expelled immediately after entry are stored in our bodies.\nFor example, when toxic gases such as sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide or toxic substances such as lead, mercury, or chlorine meet large water molecules, they are encapsulated by the clusters of water.\u00a0 Where these toxins are accumulated, blood circulation is blocked and cellular energy is impaired.\u00a0 However, when a 7-14 micron FIR wave is applied to these large water molecules, the water begins to vibrate.\u00a0 This vibration reduces the ion bonds of the atoms which are holding together the molecules of water.\u00a0 As the breakdown of the water molecules occurs, encapsulated gases and other toxic materials are released.\nPersonal Health Benefits\nAccording to The McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology:\u00a0 \"Medical practitioners make use of infrared radiant heat to treat sprains, strains, bursitis, peripheral vascular diseases, arthritis, and muscle pain.\"\nDetoxification\nThere are few natural mechanisms within our bodies to break down and eliminate toxins.\u00a0 The one effective method that the body does use is perspiration.\u00a0 This eliminates most toxins naturally by sweating and FIR heat stimulates the sweat glands that cleanse and detoxify the skin.\u00a0 Increased blood circulation further stimulates the sweat glands, releasing the built-up toxins and waste.\u00a0 Your skin is the body's largest organ and through perspiration, it eliminates most toxins naturally.\nWeight Control\nDetoxifying the body helps in weight control.\u00a0 People who have unsuccessfully tried many diets often find success with FIR heat.\u00a0 We say \"control\" because detoxifying helps those who have a problem keeping their weight down or keeping their weight up to normal.\u00a0 Also, through the deep penetration of fat cells, FIR heat helps clear away cellulite.\nPain Management\nFIR heat relieves pain by expanding blood vessels and increasing circulation.\u00a0 Better circulation allows more oxygen to reach injured areas of the body and helps reduce pain and speed up the healing process.\u00a0 FIR is successful in treating arthritis, rheumatism, muscle spasms, back pain, headache, fibromyalgia, and other chronic pain.\nHeart Disease\nAs the body produces sweat production to cool itself, the heart works harder pumping blood at a greater rate to boost circulation, supplying the conditioning benefits of continuous exercise. Increased circulation helps to normalize blood flow and blood pressure & lowers cholesterol resulting in improved overall cardiovascular fitness.\nSkin Purification\nEveryone is looking for beautiful, youthful, glowing skin.\u00a0 FIR heat improves circulation, expels dirt and chemicals and removes dead cells on the surface of the skin.\u00a0 Increased blood circulation improves tone, elasticity, texture and fresh color of the skin.\u00a0 It has also been shown to relieve acne, eczema, psoriasis, burns, lesions, and cuts.\nRelaxation\nProbably the most immediate effect of FIR healing heat is immense relaxation.\u00a0 FIR heat loosens muscles and relaxes the whole body.\u00a0 It is hard to believe that something that feels this good is actually one of the best healing therapies for your vital health!\nCan a person overdose on far-infrared energy? No.\u00a0 Tissues take only what they need for wellness and healing, and the rest passes through harmlessly.\nFIR healing heat is a central tool in the effort to retain or regain good health.\u00a0 It should be used in conjunction with a healthy lifestyle that includes healthy water, clean air, good food, proper supplementation, moderate exercise and sufficient rest.\nFar-infrared TDP Mineral Lamps\nWhat is the TDP Far-infrared Mineral Lamp?\nThe TDP Special Electromagnetic Health Lamp (TDP Lamp for short) was invented in China by a group of scientists and physicians headed by Dr. Gou Wenbin.\u00a0 The TDP Lamp is a new type of therapeutic and health device.\u00a0 With the functions of promoting metabolism, regulating physiological deficiency, diminishing inflammation and easing pain, the TDP Lamp has proven extraordinarily effective in treating numerous ailments such as muscular aches and pains, soft tissue injuries, arthritis and various skin conditions.\u00a0 Since introduced into clinic and family use in early 1980's, the TDP Lamp has successfully treated up to 60 million patients in China, Hong Kong, South Asia, Japan, Europe, Australia, and recently in North America.\nHow the TDP Lamp Works\nThe TDP Lamp is different from the conventional heat lamps, infrared lamps and microwave therapeutic devices.\u00a0 The TDP Lamp features a round plate coated with a proprietary mineral clay formation consisting of 33 earth elements essential to the human body.\u00a0 When activated by the built-in electric heating element, this mineral plate emits a special band of far-infrared waves ranging from 2 to 25 (microns) in wavelength and 281034 mw/sq. cm in intensity that coincide with the wavelengths and intensity of the electromagnetic radiations emanating from the human body.\u00a0 As a result, the TDP far- infrared waves are readily absorbed.\nIt is intended to emit energy in the infrared spectrum to provide topical heating for the purpose of temporarily elevating local tissue temperature and to use for the temporary relief and relaxation of minor muscle and joint stiffness.\u00a0 The heat generated is constant and very soothing to muscles and joints.\u00a0 It looks like a lamp, but does not produce any visible light.\nDue to its prominent therapeutic effects, the TDP Mineral Lamp is known in China and Hong Kong as the \"Miracle Lamp\".\u00a0 As a confirmation of its acceptance by the international community, the TDP Mineral Lamp won a gold medal at the 35th Brussels Eureka World Fair for Invention in 1986.\nHow to Use the TDP Far-infrared Mineral Lamps\nTo use a TDP lamp simply aim it at the painful area. The penetrating far-infrared energy will be felt as a gentle warmth in the treated area.\nThe far-infrared energy penetrates up to 3 inches and stimulates micro-circulation in the area, promoting the delivery of higher levels of oxygen and nutrients to the injured cells while eliminating toxins and cellular waste.\u00a0 Healing begins as pain is being relieved.\nThe FDA and hundreds of scientific, clinical, university and medical studies agree that Far-Infrared Mineral Therapy relieves pain.\nThe TDP Mineral Lamp is registered with the FDA as a medical device, making it legal to sell in the United States, and it is acceptable for Insurance billing under CPT Code 97026.\nBenefits of Far-infrared Heat on the Human Body\nRaises temperature in tissue\n"}, {"score": 521.6762, "uuid": "5e0e5e19-743d-53c2-a162-294217a5162d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1200tw-84-02869", "target_hostname": "www.medicalnewstoday.com", "target_uri": "http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/243547.php?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "<em>What</em> Are <em>The</em> Leading Causes Of Cancer Deaths In India?", "snippet": "&quot;<em>What</em> Are <em>The</em> Leading Causes Of Cancer Deaths In India?.&quot; Retrieved from Please note: If no author information <em>is</em> provided, <em>the</em> source <em>is</em> cited instead.", "explanation": null, "document": "What Are The Leading Causes Of Cancer Deaths In India?\nEditor's Choice\n1 posts\nAccording to a study published Online First by The Lancet, breast, cervical and stomach cancers are responsible for the majority of cancer deaths among women in India, while lung, oral and stomach cancers are the leading causes of cancer death in Indian men.\nThe study was conducted by Professor Prabhat Jha, Center for Global Health Research, St. Michael's Hospital and University of Toronto, ON, Canada, and colleagues across India and worldwide.\nIn India, approximately 75% of individuals live in rural areas. However, estimated mortality rates for specific cancers have primarily been based on data from India's 24 urban population-based cancer registries, with only 2 registries representing rural areas.\nAs a result, the team set out to evaluate cancer mortality in the Million Death Study (MDS). The MDS is one of the few large, nationally representative studies (including rural areas) of the causes of mortality in any low- or middle-income country and is conducted by the Office of the Registrar General of India.\nThe researchers focused on the social and geographical variation in specific cancers, as well as the extent to which these cancers might be preventable by managing their causative agents or risk factors.\nThe team discovered that of the 122,429 deaths reported in the study, 7,137 were caused by cancer. This figure is equal 556,400 cancer deaths across the entire country of India in 2010.\nOf these 556,400 deaths, 71% (395,000 [195,300 women and 200,100 men]) occurred in individuals aged between 30 and 69 years. For all age groups, the team found that cancer was responsible for 6% of the 2.5 million total male deaths and 1.6 million total female deaths, however this figure rose to 8% among the 30-69 years age group.\nAccording to the researchers, the three leading causes of cancer death in men aged 30-69 years were:\nLung cancer (including larynx and trachea) - 11% (22,900)\nOral cancer (including pharynx and lip) - 23% (45,800)\nStomach cancer - 13% (25,00)\nCervical Cancer - 17% (33,400)\nStomach Cancer - 14% (27,500)\nFurthermore, 42.0% (84,000) of male cancer deaths at ages 30-69 years were tobacco-related as were 18.3% (35,700) of female cancer deaths, and that oral cancers were responsible for twice as many deaths as lung cancer. According to the team this is partially due to prevalent use of chewing tobacco in men and women.\nThe researchers explained:\n\"The number of oral cancers was more than twice the number of lung cancers in individuals aged 30-69 years, indicating that the range of fatal cancers caused by tobacco in India differs substantially from that in high-income countries.\"\nAlthough results showed that age-standardized cancer mortality rates per 100,000 were comparable in rural and urban ages (men 96, women 97 vs. men 102, women 91 respectively), they varied considerably between the states.\nThey found that mortality rates were twice as high in the least educated (107 men, 107 women) than in the majority of educated adults (46 men, 43 women). In addition, the prevalence of cervical cancer was 40% less in Muslim women than in Hindu women. According to the researchers, this may be due to high circumcision rates among Muslim men having a protective effect against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which can cause cervical cancer.\nFurthermore, results from the study showed that men aged 30 in northeastern India had the greatest risk (11.2%) of dying from cancer before the age of 70.

However, estimated mortality rates for specific cancers have primarily been based on data from India's 24 urban population-based cancer registries, with only 2 registries representing rural areas.\nAs a result, the team set out to evaluate cancer mortality in the Million Death Study (MDS). The MDS is one of the few large, nationally representative studies (including rural areas) of the causes of mortality in any low- or middle-income country and is conducted by the Office of the Registrar General of India.\nThe researchers focused on the social and geographical variation in specific cancers, as well as the extent to which these cancers might be preventable by managing their causative agents or risk factors.\nThe team discovered that of the 122,429 deaths reported in the study, 7,137 were caused by cancer. This figure is equal 556,400 cancer deaths across the entire country of India in 2010.\nOf these 556,400 deaths, 71% (395,000 [195,300 women and 200,100 men]) occurred in individuals aged between 30 and 69 years. For all age groups, the team found that cancer was responsible for 6% of the 2.5 million total male deaths and 1.6 million total female deaths, however this figure rose to 8% among the 30-69 years age group.\nAccording to the researchers, the three leading causes of cancer death in men aged 30-69 years were:\nLung cancer (including larynx and trachea) - 11% (22,900)\nOral cancer (including pharynx and lip) - 23% (45,800)\nStomach cancer - 13% (25,00)\nCervical Cancer - 17% (33,400)\nStomach Cancer - 14% (27,500)\nFurthermore, 42.0% (84,000) of male cancer deaths at ages 30-69 years were tobacco-related as were 18.3% (35,700) of female cancer deaths, and that oral cancers were responsible for twice as many deaths as lung cancer. According to the team this is partially due to prevalent use of chewing tobacco in men and women.\nThe researchers explained:\n\"The number of oral cancers was more than twice the number of lung cancers in individuals aged 30-69 years, indicating that the range of fatal cancers caused by tobacco in India differs substantially from that in high-income countries.\"\nAlthough results showed that age-standardized cancer mortality rates per 100,000 were comparable in rural and urban ages (men 96, women 97 vs. men 102, women 91 respectively), they varied considerably between the states.\nThey found that mortality rates were twice as high in the least educated (107 men, 107 women) than in the majority of educated adults (46 men, 43 women). In addition, the prevalence of cervical cancer was 40% less in Muslim women than in Hindu women. According to the researchers, this may be due to high circumcision rates among Muslim men having a protective effect against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which can cause cervical cancer.\nFurthermore, results from the study showed that men aged 30 in northeastern India had the greatest risk (11.2%) of dying from cancer before the age of 70. However, in the adjacent states of Odissa, Bihar, and Jharkhand in eastern India, the death risk for men was less than 3%. In addition, women in the northeastern states of India had the greatest risk (6.0%) of dying from cancer before the age of 70.\nCancer mortality rates in India are approximately 40% lower in adult men and 30% lower in women than rates in the UK or United States.

I have some clients that feel better with some animal protein in their diets- and that is okay, but we greatly reduce the frequency and amount of their animal protein consumption.\nFor someone going through all illness/disease a vegan diet is recommended because it is so alkaline-forming, and brings more oxygen into the body, while simultaneous acidic foods are reduced. For strength, you can add healthy whole grains like quinoa, millet and millet bread.\nI\u2019m so sorry to hear about your husband, but I pray for his healing and recovery.\nKeep in touch xx, Kimberly\nOli January 24, 2012 at 11:54 am #\nI think i gained weight by just reading about these shows\u2026 back to my carrots.\nReply\nAngela Sands January 24, 2012 at 11:59 am #\nMy husband and I feel very disappointed that someone with Paula Deen\u2019s influence chooses to endorse pharmaceuticals instead of revamping her recipes for healthy living. What a missed opportunity!\nReply\nEmily January 24, 2012 at 12:13 pm #\nI need to chime in on this as someone who actually works for Food Network (and drinks a GGS for breakfast at her desk!) While I agree that a lot of the shows/recipes lean towards the indulgent, the fact of that matter is that that\u2019s exactly what America wants to see. There are healthy shows on the air, like Ellie Krieger\u2019s, but in general the programming is responsive to what people will watch. If Americans would watch an entire network\u2019s worth of healthy cooking shows, that\u2019s exactly what would be on the air. People often blame Food Network for forcing certain shows or content down people\u2019s throats, but unfortunately, the shows that are on the air are the shows that people want to watch. NBC doesn\u2019t keep running shows that people don\u2019t watch, and neither does FN. It\u2019s sad, but that\u2019s the reality. If enough people would watch a vegetarian, vegan or raw food show, then they would put them on the air.\nAnd for what it\u2019s worth, I totally agree with Kim about the medicating part of the American lifestyle. I am so sick of all the ads for heartburn medications telling people that now they can eat their \u201cfavorite foods\u201d. Maybe your body is telling you to stop eating chili dogs and pizza!\nKimberly Snyder January 25, 2012 at 7:25 am #\nHi Emily,\nThanks for contributing! I am glad you are a GGS drinker.\nI with that programs on healthier foods could be made as equally fun or entertaining as something like Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.\nI also have an issue with \u201chealthier\u201d programs promoting low-cal products such as artificial sweeteners. That is not really healthy to me.\nCome visit again. xx\nReply\nEmily January 26, 2012 at 9:24 am #\nTotally agree Kim\u2013 they should be made to me fun and entertaining, not positioned as a \u201ctrade off\u201d.

While the viewer is responsible for what they eat, many are them are addicts! Would you show a drug addict more ways to obtain drugs just because that is what they want? To many, food is a drug. Until the food network acknowledges this and takes a bit of responsibility for what they show nothing will change. Most likely a few of your so called \u201cchefs\u201d or hosts will unfortunately at the least be very sick from their overindulgence which I find quite disgusting. If you actually watch earlier shows you can see the fluctuation of your hosts weights change which I would think would concern you just on a human level!\nBottom line to your network is the all\nmighty $!

She withheld her illness so that her dynasty wouldn\u2019t suffer. I find that dispicable. How can someone in good conscience use their celebrity to continue to influence us in bad nutrition.\nAdditionally, she is either in denial, not well informed or just plain stupid.

Although I don\u2019t think my country (The Netherlands) is a particularly \u201chealthy\u201d country (we consume disturbingly high amounts of dairy, which makes me an outsider as I\u2019m lactose intolerant hehe) I was raised on a balanced diet always including a lot of veggies, fruit and vegetarian options for dinner. When I came to live in The US I was very surprised at everything I\u2019d see in restaurants, in the supermarkets and on TV. The portions in The US are gigantic!\nI remember back then I\u2019d still occasionally go to Mc Donalds (no longer, don\u2019t worry;). The first time I went I ordered one portion of small fries. However they gave me a large fries \u2013 I thought \u201chow nice, more fries!\u201d but only to discover that this actually was a small portion \u2013 it\u2019s just that a USA small portion equals a Dutch large portion! I always thought that was weird, but I saw it everywhere. In supermarkets you can buy so much meat and gallons of soda \u2013 you can\u2019t buy those amounts here, people would think you\u2019re crazy buying anything more than 1 or 1.5 liters (regular size of a big bottle here) of soda. It\u2019s more about portion control here.\nAnyway I noticed these things on TV too. The cooking shows are really gross to me. Consuming so much butter and fat? I remember in the beginning I\u2019d think they were a joke \u2013 like no one actually eats these unhealthy foods right? But I quickly learned that they do. Of course not everyone, I don\u2019t want to offend anyone on here =) But that definitely set me apart from for example many of my co-workers in The US. I would happily eat a big salad for lunch but eating a burger and fries seemed the norm for many. I did end up gaining some weight by the way in that period because I wanted to fit in somewhat, but it all came off once I moved back to Europe.\nI love The US and love coming back but I will never understand its fascination with unhealthy foods!\nbarbara January 24, 2012 at 4:44 pm #\nThanks Sofie, I am from Gemany, yes we love our Pastry and breads\nbut we still watch out for a Balanced Diet.

What Paula Deen does is her choice, and we\u2019re all allowed to choose for good or worse. To \u201ccriminalize\u201d wrong choices that require our complicity to become dangerous is in itself dangerous, in my opinion.\nI agree with pointing out in great detail how poor choices if followed will not bring health.\nThe \u201chealth\u201d sector\u2019s assault on others choices isnt any different than the government trying to take raw milk away because they have decided it\u2019s bad for us.

Media is not the only reason we eat more and less nutritious food. Industrialization and technology started that. Technology has allowed packaged food to exist. The rich, who had everything prepared by servants in olden times, ate rich, bad for you food. As these kinds of foods became more available to the not-rich their use increased.

Yes, lifestyle can be a factor, but there is a genetic component to these diseases as well. As a health care provider, I have seen some individuals at a healthy body weight who have a good diet and exercise habits and yet they too develop Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and other diseases. On the plus side, they seem to be better able to manage their disease with little or no meds.\nJustin January 24, 2012 at 2:27 pm #\nGreat post, Kimberly.\nReply\nFiza Nazari January 24, 2012 at 3:03 pm #\nI\u2019m from Azerbaijan and I have been leaving in Canada for 9 years. All these years I tried to keep our culture because of my daughter. What usually kids eat here: burgers, fries, mac and cheese..pop\u2026 Back home we eat a lot veggies and herbs. I offer my daughter;s friends (15-16 years old) healthy smoothies, salads with fruits and veggies, parfaits and when they eat, it makes me happy. My point is we have to educate young generation, make healthy food at home. They eat whatever we make.\nWhat about Food network??? I stopped watching it . It\u2019s business. Let them make money and let people make healthy choices. Everybody should be his own doctor.\nThanks to you Kimberly for your book. I took recipes and advices from that.\nReply\nJames January 24, 2012 at 3:04 pm #\nEven before I was eating clean I found her recipes to be utterly unappealing. If she won\u2019t change her brand (along with her herself), she will be a sad example of what poor nutrition does for you. I used to love the Food Network and find it so hard to relate to now.\nSidenote: can you talk about juicers vs cold pressed, masticating juicers? I know you love your vitamix for smoothies, but I\u2019m confused by everything I read re juicing & with all the cold-pressed juiceries here in LA. Does cold-pressed really preserve more nutrients?

Try my Chickpea-Less Hummus recipe, salsa, regular hummus if you are in a bind, or the Green bean-Miso dip.\nTry Radiant Beauty and the GGS and see how you do.\nIf you\u2019re having trouble with a huge amount of raw veggies, then steam your veggies at dinner, and let your digestion build up naturally. xx\nLori January 24, 2012 at 3:47 pm #\nThanks for including this Kimberly. It\u2019s nice to see some discussion-provoking topics.\nFor whatever reason, it has always bothered me when people say things like \u201ceat to live\u201d or that food\u2019s only purpose is to fuel our bodies. While I DO agree that health should be the top priority, I feel that taste has to at least be a close 2nd (or tie for first). Food can be healthy and tasty. There has to be moderation. We are human \u2013 I don\u2019t think it is possible, or beneficial, to make yourself eat something that tastes terrible to you, and you sure aren\u2019t going to convert other people to make healthy choices if you make health food all the time that is not tasty. Food will always be more than fuel \u2013 it will be entertainment, friendship, a hobby\u2026the list goes on. But simply referring to it as fuel is sad and makes me want to give on on eating! haha. I know that wasn\u2019t the point of this blog, but I just had to add my thoughts. And I think Paula is irresponsible. The end!\nReply\nmarijka January 24, 2012 at 5:18 pm #\nI agree, Lori! Humans are \u2018allowed\u2019 pleasure, and taste definitely counts. Some people can eat strictly for fuel, and more power to \u2018em, but I love to cook and eat, and sometimes a green smoothie just doesn\u2019t cut it. (Well, beyond my daily breakfast shake, of course.)\nWhat I have been doing for years, however, is modifying my farm-raised Tennessee recipes, eating controlled portions,and the majority of my diet is very clean. Balance and moderation plus a lot of exercise is working for me. My blood presser and such are good, I feel good, and my taste buds are happy, too.\nReply\nKimberly Snyder January 25, 2012 at 7:40 am #\nI agree. I love having nice meals with my family, cooking with my mom, and having romantic dinners with my boyfriend. But I think those memories can be built around healthier (even if not perfect, but better) choices which promote your loved ones getting- and staying-healthy. xx\nJen January 24, 2012 at 3:52 pm #\nHi Kimberly,\nI was so happy to find this post in my email today! As I flip through the channels and see some of these food shows, I find myself repeatedly uttering the words \u201cand this is why Americans have diabetes, heart problems, etc\u201d Thanks for also commenting about the \u201chealth\u201d food shows as well because I agree that they are not necessarily promoting healthy eating. For years it has always amazed me people would rather pop a pill than not eat what is giving them heartburn.\nThanks for being amazing and continuing to inspire us!\n-Jen\nReply\nJessica Saraceno January 24, 2012 at 4:00 pm #\nI have to admit I have been a fan of the Food Network for many years, and have grown to love many of the people on it and their network shows. Although I am a healthy eater and vegetarian, I still tune in and watch the shows occasionally. I have to admit though that I often do get disgusted at the amounts of red meat, butter, sugar, and other unhealthy foods that are commonly used in their recipes and often in copious amounts. I used to make some of their recipes back in the day, but I do not make them now. When I tune in, it\u2019s purely for entertainment purposes and to see some of my favorite chefs. However, I can\u2019t say that this is the same for others and that there aren\u2019t people who watch these shows and think that it\u2019s \u201cOK\u201d to eat these foods because it\u2019s on the Food Network. I was not aware that Paula Deen had been diagnosed with diabetes, and I agree with you that taking a pill to mask the underlying health conditions that she has is not sending out a good message. Unfortunately, this is commonplace in today\u2019s society and it really is sad. I am a huge fan of the Beauty Detox Solution and practice it daily, and I am also working on my master\u2019s degree in Human Nutrition. All that we can do as health professionals is educate as many people as we can about the dangers of the standard American diet and conventional medicine, and show them that there are other much more healthy options available to them.\nReply\nKaty January 24, 2012 at 4:01 pm #\nI remember many years ago there was a cooking show called The Galloping Gourmet, starring Graham Kerr. He was British, but cooked French type food, with lots of butter and sauces. After his wife had a stroke he completely changed his ways and began to prepare healthy foods. He\u2019s still at it, his wife is still alive, and now he\u2019s into gardening. If Paula Deen would do the same, people would love and honor her the way they do with Graham Kerr. PR-wise it would be a great opportunity for her. I love Paula, she\u2019s a lot of fun to watch, but I never actually used one of her recipes after seeing her prepare it on her show. It\u2019s entertainment, that\u2019s all.\nReply\nbarbara January 24, 2012 at 4:59 pm #\nThanks Kimberly ,you point it out. I work right now in the US but I am from Germany.\nYes, we do love our cakes, breads and chocolates, but in Balance.Sure we have people who are overweight we make no exeption.\nA recent Survey point out that over 60% of people in Germany eat fresh Veggie and Fruits on al daily basic.that is the Way I was brought up, Meat ,Deli Meats Sweets in Moderation .\nBut in that is shocking to me , Americans love their fake Butters(Magarine),unhealthy Oils(to hight in Omega6), believe in everything which tells them it is light,has no fat and sugar.Their are obsessed in their Sodas and Fast Foods\nObesity is the new Way of Life and like many of my Patients have told me, you get sick ,you go to the Doctor and get a prescription.\nI stay away from any American made Food and buy everything organic as much as possible. Did you know that theK American Food chain contains ,but you find it also in Cosmetic and Plastic has still more than 1000 Chemicals ,which are banned in Europe i.e.BPA? But their are people outhere who are turning the deadly tide wave around and trying to eat and live healthy.\nWell the US is shoveling it\u2019s own Grave.\nYou are doing a great Job , Kimberly, go on and tell the Truth\nI love your recipes\nReply\nJamie January 24, 2012 at 5:27 pm #\nI agree that it\u2019s just a Network. I would put more of the responsibility on the parents and the school system. I think there should be a mandatory nutritional class in schools to help educate children on how to eat properly as well as a complete overhaul of the cafeterias across the US (i.e. Jamie\u2019s Food Revolution). Not to mention, the big culprit\u2026 the media which is more than likely being influenced by the Meat and Dairy companies. However, in the end, it\u2019s up to the individual to take responsibility for themselves. It\u2019s time to start taking a good look at what we are putting into our bodies.\nReply\nKimberly Snyder January 25, 2012 at 7:45 am #\nHi Jamie, as I said above, that is true and everyone is 100% responsible for their own choices. But I just wish there were more programs out there that could support and teach people to eat healthier. And as you mentioned, teaching kids to be healthier from the start would be amazing and help to alleviate so much suffering later in their lives. xx\nJulie January 24, 2012 at 6:48 pm #\nHave you ever stopped to think about how much food in general is overrated?\nBefore anyone can gain a clear head about food, the person really needs to detoxify for a few months. I have only been in Phase 2 for eight months \u2013 no deviations because I do not want to deviate. But my point is, only after this period of cleansing was I able to gain a clear perspective on food.\nThe residual chemicals from eating dairy and meat have begun to lift, and so has the craving for such foods. Detoxing cleans your head, heart, mind and appetite. Living this way changes more than your skin and digestion. It gives you a lightness and a feeling of detachment from so many low, heavy, corporal things of earth. Intuition and empathy are heightened, and it brings a feeling of connectedness.\nIt is sad to think of so many people doped by the rich foods they put into their bodies. I do not judge people who continue to eat bad foods; they are missing the fullness of life. Being in a detoxified body brings such spiritual awareness that it transfers life into another plane, much like distance running. It awakens you. How sad to miss that for a doughnut or some gloppy pasta.\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about shoving things into a hole in your face anyway?\nGreat article, thoughtful comments.\nKimberly Snyder January 25, 2012 at 7:45 am #\nWonderful Julie!

Food has become a drug of choice for too many Americans including those I love dearly. Paula Dean in my opinion is like the food addicts I know. She has her head in the sand when it comes to healthy eating and will more than likely never change her eating habits.

Food really has become a drug, but interestingly enough, anorexia seems to be on the rise as well as obesity, at least in my observation.\nAlso observed is the number of cancer patients I have recently met, who informed me that their doctors have instructed them to not only NOT change their poor diets, but to \u201cEAT WORSE because the chemotherapy will kill all the bad stuff they put in their bodies anyway. Oh and don\u2019t bother eating healthy stuff because the chemo will kill that too.\u201d How many times have I heard OVERWEIGHT cancer patients tell me that thIs year is astounding- am I wrong to be shocked that doctors would be sayIng this?? Or are these all just cases of people hearing only what they want to hear??\nCall me crazy, but maybe an alkaline diet would be a good thing for someone who has cancer.

However, if we want to promote better health in our children and adults, the first thing we have to do is acknowledge that yes, food is indeed a \u201ccultural and social experience\u201d\u2013as well as a source of pleasure\u2013and has been for centuries. For those reasons and more, what one eats is a deeply personal matter. I have changed the way I eat over the past few years after working with a naturopathic nutritionist and later learning more from Kimberly. I derive as much pleasure from the way I eat (most of the time\u2013this is a constant evolution and journey) now as I did when I was eating less healthfully and less mindfully. But it is difficult even to talk to so many people about food and making the smallest changes in their lives. I don\u2019t have the answers here, but I believe the approach to teaching better nutrition needs to include the social, sensual, and fun aspects of eating more healthfully. If eating is presented as simply a mandatory biological function, it will be a much harder sell.\nI love to cook, and to eat, and my feelings about the Food Network have truly turned into a love-hate relationship over the past few years. I was so glad to see Giada de Laurentiis making green juice on one of her recent episodes, saying how good it made her feel to drink it after practicing yoga. But it is rare to see something like that. If it happened more often I think people would be inspired and get on board.\nReply\nErika January 25, 2012 at 7:20 am #\nIMHO it speaks volumes Paula,Deen is working with a Big Pharma.Most Big Pharma will do ANYTHING for the BENJAMINS!To advocate is great.To.work with most Big Pharmas is greed.\nReply\nLaura January 25, 2012 at 11:02 am #\nWhat responsibility does the Food Network have on how I nourish myself? Really? Is anybody telling me that a TV network has any responsibility on what I put on my table and in my belly? WAKE UP PEOPLE! Throw your TV out of the window and live life RESPONSIBLY, the only people who are not responsible of their lives are babies! And that\u2019s only temporary. TV is made by those who watch it, where there no shares, there would be no Deen\u2019s show, Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, Cupcake Wars, and Dessert First. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE OF OURSELVES AND OUR KIDS, so let\u2019s give them a PROPER education, and let us not leave the Disney Channel do that for us. It\u2019s the same as letting the Food Channel educating us on healthy diets. The way we eat is part of that education, and this comes from an Italian raised on pasta and bread, luckily enough in our kitchen there have always been fresh fruits and vegetables, but also meat of all sort, desserts and industrial foods. The information we need is out there, one only needs to go and click for it, it\u2019s that easy, one only needs the will and the interest to do it. Let us all change our values, let us all look up to people who really support what\u2019s important, not only a healthy lifestyle, but also (yes, it\u2019s cheesy, this is how bad the situation is, it\u2019s cheesy to mention what really matters) love, friendship, support, compassion, understanding, kindness, in short humanity\u2026\nReply\nSusan January 25, 2012 at 11:54 am #\nI\u2019m sorry, but are we forgetting that we have a free will? Who cares what the Food Network is cooking and baking. It\u2019s our choice whether or not we eat and/or make the food that they\u2019re sharing with us. If you make every single Paula Deen recipe and expect to be slim\u2026then you\u2019re slightly disillusioned. All in all, it\u2019s a network that shares recipes. When did people become so misguided that they began to blame their obesity on everything and everyone but themselves?\nReply\nKatherine January 25, 2012 at 7:18 pm #\nThank you so much for this. I am beyond angry about what Paula Dean is doing. She earned herself a disease by eating garbage and is now saying there\u2019s a magic pill to cure it so that she can continue to eat the garbage that got her here. Bravo Paula! What are the side effects? Has the drug been around long enough for long term testing? How many studies on it? How many participants? Prescriptions are not the answer and I\u2019m nauseated at my own culture. How many people do you know over age 40 on 1 medication? Then they add another and another, each needed to fix something that the last medication damaged. How about stressing how NOT to earn type 2 diabetes? Our food and greedy doctors are killing us. I never questioned my doctor when he told me not to worry about the side effects he was required by law to warn me about. Well at 31 years of age I found out that I need a hip replacement. Multiple doctors told me separately that it\u2019s because of the medication I was on, and being on it too often. Yes I\u2019m angry, but I took responsibility. I said no more unnecessary meds. I took myself off one that I noticed made me gain 80 pounds over almost 10 years. I knew that if I continued, I\u2019d have heart disease and diabetes and I wouldn\u2019t deserve any sympathy because it would have been my own fault. I came off the med and realized that I was fine without it! Then I found a naturopath who gave me a strict diet. I had been on multiple long term chemo pills to cure my pain and after 6 months of eating a perfect diet, I didn\u2019t even need my opiates anymore! I\u2019ve lost 50 pounds so far, 30 more to go. Now even though I have a limp because I am doing physical therapy (which works) and putting off the inevitable surgery for as long as I can, I still look hot and turn heads. I earned it and people like Paula Dean can be sick and not have energy and not LIVE all they want because that\u2019s what she earned.\nReply\nGina January 25, 2012 at 10:20 pm #\nLet me just start off by saying, from the perspective of a 26yrld female whose father & his sister both have type 2diabetes, ive always been annoyed while watching Paula. That lady would eat a stick of butter on camera if it wouldn\u2019t completely gross out America. Its true, we have been programmed to believe eating this way is acceptable but are then dumbfounded when a disease or imprefection stricks. The simplest solution is the hardest for some\u2026it hasn\u2019t been battered & deep fried. We are not judging, it is really just caring for the well being of our fellow humans. I know I feel the urgency to implement wisdom I\u2019ve grown to have as far as health and nutrition on my family members & friends. Maybe some feel its not my place to get involved, but I love them & will stop at nothing to help them stick around on this earth for as long as possible. It is sad when people rely more on the drugs they have to treat illnesses/diseases instead of changing their lifestyle. My dad was sick of taking insulin, so he changed his eating habits, started working out,& now is off his meds & barely needs to checks his blood sugar. He does have the occasional indulgence, but what drives him is the desire to see his granddaughter grow up! I\u2019m so proud of him.\nThank you Kimberly for caring!\n*teeny tiny sidenote: any tips on how to get rid of pet/animal allergies?! Haha!

I am sure due to the fact that she has diabetes, and everyone knows now, that she will start creating more healthy recipes. I sure hope so anyway.\nI do agree that it would be awesome to have a tv show that promoted healthy eating. And not just low calorie eating like hungry girl using aritificial sweetners.

After implementing your plan a couple of weeks ago I had hoped to lose some of that weight, but I haven\u2019t. I have reduced my dairy drastically, consuming maybe 1/4 cup in my morning coffee. No cheese ever again. The food pairing and the light-to-heavy rules have improved my skin and made me FEEL lighter but my size 2-4 pants are still snug. I am 5\u20194\u2033 and 130 pounds, formerly 120. I used to be able to eat whatever I wanted in any measure before that darn psoriasis. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the meds, or the fact that I am a few months from hitting thirty, but I will beat this flab! I was wondering if you could offer any advice to me. I WILL follow it, because my brain fog has cleared up and my emotions are stable. No more PMS mood swings, whoa!!! Thanks for this wealth of health, and good information.\nKimberly Snyder February 1, 2012 at 5:49 pm #\nHi Lilly,\nThat is so wonderful to hear and I am thrilled to hear of your progress! Keep up the good work! Keep us updated.\nxx\nReply\nNatalia February 2, 2012 at 9:27 am #\nI LOVE this more than I can express. I was a big a Food Network watcher until I decided to sway my meat eating habits into a more Raw/ Veggie-centric lifestyle. Truth be told i do still eat very small amounts of animal protein and watch the Food Network from time to time but I always end up changing the channel because NOTHING they make I can really eat without feeling terrible later(not just psychologically, but physically) I\nIt would certainly be nice to have a show that considers food combination and touts the importance Raw Veggie Juice as opposed to feeding the lies of Yogurt is your friend and don\u2019t forget you NEEEEEEED animal protein! LOTS & LOTS of animal protein.\nReply\nColleen February 2, 2012 at 6:06 pm #\nWhoa, I\u2019m certainly late to the discussion, and don\u2019t have time to read ALL the comments, but my knee jerk is THANK YOU KIM. Whether we like it or not, the entertainment industry leads by example. Just tonight I saw that Pippa is sporting shocking pink (ish) jeans to brighten up the winter doldrums. Whether women look like Pippa in them or not, they\u2019re going to wear them because she does! I can almost hear the viewer comments: \u201cIf Paula Deen is condoning 2 sticks of butter in every recipe, it can\u2019t be as bad for me as everyone says it is.\u201d\nI\u2019ve never even watched her show, but as a nutritionist in private practice for 17 years, have heard all of the justifications.\nThank God for people like you, Kim, who tell it like it is and have the reach to influence a lot of people. I am a relatively new subscriber to your site and have purchased (and am using) your book. As a an RD in private practice, I frequently deal with some pretty seriously train wreck diets, (as I\u2019m sure you do) and often have to start from a rather conservative place. The goal is always to tell it like it is. All this \u201csugar coating\u201d (among other things) is what got us into this country\u2019s seriously troubling health debacle to begin with.\nYou can\u2019t \u201clet people be their own judge\u201d without educating them. There needs to be as much (in my opinion, MORE) valid, healthy, useful information available as there is all the unhealthy, entertainment-driven garbage that is killing the more than 50% of this country who have proven they are not responsible enough to take care of their own health and wellness.\nKeep up your great work Kim, and thank you!\nReply\nMartha February 5, 2012 at 7:47 pm #\nI don\u2019t want the Food Network, mainly because I find their cooking shows subpar. Their show hosts are mostly pushing Denny\u2019s type crap I wouldn\u2019t ever eat at any time. It\u2019s a shame, because when the Food Network started, it had some great shows. Somewhere along the line, it dumped a lot of great programming and started hiring JUNKY non-cooking fast-food hosts like Rachel Ray who did NOT even KNOW how to cook.\nIn fact, after the first disasterous season, she had to be sent off to cooking school to be taught how to use a chef\u2019s knife. She was a weather girl in upstate New York, completely unqualified (and still is unqualified) to host a cooking show. She\u2019s only there for the T&A. Same with Sandra Lee, only there for the Eye Candy Factor. Her recipes are so ghastly, they have me wanting to puke if I ever have the stomach to actually sit through one of her hideous shows. She literally throws together cans of garbage to concoct these horrifically bad menus not even a dog should be allowed to eat.\nAnd the Barefoot Contessa. Ug!!! I can\u2019t watch that tub-o-lard since the time we had to watch her lower herself into a hot tub. I still have nightmares from that. *shudder*\nAnd then there\u2019s Mr. Worst Hair Style on Television Guy Fieri. His Denny\u2019s style \u201ccuisine\u201d is basic low-brow basic diner fair. Which explains why he\u2019s at least 100 pounds overweight. His dismeanor is as bad as his food and unwatchable.\nAnd Dino\u2019s daughter Giada\u2026.you KNOW she doesn\u2019t eat\u2026anything!!! She weighs what all of 70, 80 pounds at the very most, so if she does eat, it\u2019s rarely and works it off for hours afterwards.\nBut there is a silver lining. You didn\u2019t mention Andrew Zimmern from the Travel Network who lost A LOT of weight! And looks great!!! So let\u2019s give credit where it\u2019s due. Maybe some can get a boost so start losing weight by watching someone who\u2019s doing it right.\nAnd by the way\u2026I am not overweight, though I was at one time. I have worked very hard to lose weight, I run, am a vegetarian, eat right, enter half marathons and marathons and keep myself very fit. So I practice what I preach.\n"}], [{"score": 477.80334, "uuid": "9883246d-2af6-5121-b2d1-4e01639aa3e4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300wb-04-00093", "target_hostname": "news.runnersworld.com", "target_uri": "http://news.runnersworld.com/2011/06/06/1215/", "page_rank": 1.1771267e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "<em>What</em> Are You Wearing? | News", "snippet": "birth control pill prednisone azathioprine hair loss prednisone prednisone treatment for neuropathy in dogs <em>is</em> prednisone used for headaches oral prednisone bulging disc in spine prednisone half-life <em>what</em> <em>is</em> prednisone used f cortisol <em>vs</em> prednisone effects of taking prednisone short term mitoxantrone", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nAlmost 55,000 people ran the Bolder Boulder 10K last week, which means that almost 55,000 different racing ensembles \u2014 combinations of shoes, socks, bottoms, tops, glasses, hats, etc. \u2014 were put together that morning and worn for the same race. In fact, this year's Bolder Boulder had the millionth runner cross the finish line since the first time the race was run 33 years ago. That, to a gear-head, is a million different combos of outfits .\nI sat my pregnant self and my three-year-old son on a curb at mile 3 and watched everyone go by, taking particular note of runners' chosen outfits.\nFrom my highly scientific experiment, I noticed the following trend: People wear whatever the heck they want to on race day. There were folks in the racy get-up of split shorts, singlets and racing flats. Tops ranged from sports bras and shimmels, to tech tees, to long-sleeve Under Armour shirts (a few), to cotton. Bottoms? Short shorts, longer shorts, compression shorts, skirts (though, seemingly, less than last year), capris. Once in a while, someone wearing a pair of compression socks ran by (again, less than last year), plus the occasional runner carrying a backpack of some sort. I'm guessing the packs were filled with a change of clothes for the finish line.\nBut sitting curbside gave me a squirrel's eye view of footwear, mostly. Chosen shoes were predominantly daily trainers, like neutral cushioned and stability models from Asics, Nike, Brooks, Adidas and New Balance. A fair amount of Newtons , which is headquartered here in Boulder, ran on by, and I noticed the occasional trail shoes from Salomon and the like (this is a trail-happy town, after all). A few folks had on the mega-cushioned Hokas . And of course, every minute or so, a pair of Vibram Five Fingers \"barefooted\" along. I think it's this last trend that has inspired more of the...unique choices I began seeing.\nFor one, a gal ran by in ballet slippers. Honest-to-goodness ballet slippers. She wasn't wearing a tutu, like the lady cheering everyone on from the sidelines (who has been doing so at the same spot, in a tutu, for 33 years). She wore pretty standard running shorts and a tank, but on her feet were ballet slippers. That looked painful.\nBut then I saw someone wearing a pair of Crocs ...and not the newer ones with more structure and even shoe laces , but the rubber, bucket-like shoes that are extremely comfortable for gardening, lounging, and that my husband (to my dismay, especially since his are red) has worn out to dinner. But, for running? Ouch. Yes, they're lightweight, and I suppose you could call them minimal. But the main problem, I see, with running in something like Crocs is that your feet have to work to keep them on. With every step. Over 10 kilometers. That's a lot to ask of the muscles in your toes, feet, ankles, and even higher up your legs. I just wonder how that runner recovered.\nI haven't always made the best gear choices for races. Three teammates and I once wore flip-flops on a five-mile trail running section of an adventure race, with a rappel off a cliff in the middle of it, by accident. (Long story.) We ended up duct taping our sandals to our feet so they didn't flip or flop, which worked pretty well. I kind of wanted to chase down the Crocs-runner and duct tape her shoes to her feet.\nAnyhow, it does seem that the barefoot trend \u2014 and the opposite of that in Hokas \u2014 is inspiring some creative picks. And part of the beauty of running is that you can run in virtually anything. But, the question, is this: Is the shoe you're running in the absolute best choice for you and your body?\nThis entry was posted in Shoes & Gear .

Claim #1:\n\u201cSoap scum is the combination of soap materials in a normal cleansing bar with the calcium ions that come from hard water\u201d.\nTo test this out, Kevin ran a quick experiment using calcium chloride and distilled water (he essentially made hard water). He then took two separate samples of this and mixed Ivory (a soap) into one, and Equate (a detergent) into another.

That\u2019s because it is. Anything that has soap in it will interact with calcium and form \u201csoap scum\u201d. The soap in Dove interacts with the calcium in hard water, the detergent in Dove does not. Notice that the chunks in here are a little smaller than with the Ivory. So technically their claim is accurate. Dove does not interact with calcium in the same exact way as soap. It\u2019s a terribly misleading claim though, because they are implying that Dove doesn\u2019t interact with calcium at all, or that it\u2019s drastically different. In reality it\u2019s nearly the same interaction: it produced soap scum!\nVERDICT: Claim #3 is absolutely misleading.\nClaim #4:\n\u201cSoap leaves scum, Dove doesn\u2019t\u201d\nWe\u2019ve already established that Dove creates scum, but does it leave that scum behind on your skin? Does regular soap leave that scum behind on your skin? Dove attempted to answer this by testing how each one rinsed from a mirror.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the \u201cexperiment\u201d used in the ad. There are a few things that are rather unscientific about it, namely:\nThe person conducting the study knows which is Dove and which is soap.\nDove is less soluble in water than soap, so the soap is going to be softer after soaking in water. This means it\u2019s likely to leave a thicker film on the mirror than the Dove.\nJudging which one washed away faster or more completely is subjective.\nYour skin is not a mirror. Demonstrating the way soap and Dove rinse off a mirror doesn\u2019t really give any valuable insight into how these things rinse off of skin.\nDr. Dunn actually improved upon this test by using a double-blind method, using a specific pattern on the mirror to reduce subjectivity, using uniform sample sizes of the different soaps tested, and running the experiment four times with four different groups of people. While his conclusions showed that Dove and Soap require a similar amount of effort to rinse, the test was still pretty subjective, and it still didn\u2019t address how well Dove and Soap rinse from a person\u2019s skin.\nSo, Dr. Dunn came up with an even better experiment. It\u2019s a pretty neat test, and it\u2019s something you can try out yourself, too!\nSoap is a surfactant. This means it lowers the surface tension of lots of liquids. The one we\u2019re interested in is water. Take a bowl of water and sprinkle pepper evenly over the surface. Now just touch the surface of the water (make sure your hands are completely clean and dry). As you\u2019d expect, nothing happens. Now dry your finger off and swipe your finger across a dry bar of soap. You now have an invisible amount of soap on your skin. Touch the water again, and you\u2019ll see the pepper fly out to the edges of the bowl. This is the visible result of the surfactant nature of soap.\nWhat Dr. Dunn did was take four groups of people and test four different kinds of cleansers: A handmade soap (his own blend he calls \u201cDelight\u201d), Dial, Dove, and Ivory. He then conducted a double-blind study using the method above (well, almost, he used a person\u2019s knuckle instead of the finger, to eliminate the chance of soap getting stuck under the fingernail and not rinsing easily).\nFirst he tested whether this method was able to detect invisible amounts of soap on your skin. Each of the four groups were able to detect invisible amounts of soap on the skin using this method.\nNext he ran the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under tap water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below. Remember this is a double-blind study, so no group is aware of which sample they are working with and judging.\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 2, 3, & 4 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 1 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nAt last, Dr. Dunn conducted the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under hard water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below:\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 1, 2, & 3 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 4 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nSo, does soap leave scum on your skin? The answer is no. However the results do bring some question as to whether Dove rinses cleanly all the time. It\u2019s not enough to just claim that Dove does not rinse cleanly, though it does make one curious.\nSome of you might be wondering \u201caren\u2019t you just testing for soap, not soap scum?\u201d It\u2019s a valid question. The answers is this test does detect soap scum, too. Soap scum actually contains soap, (it also technically is a type of calcium soap) so it will have the same surfactant effect on the peppered water as plain soap.\nLet\u2019s just recap this experiment in contrast with Dove\u2019s:\nThe person judging the experiment is unaware of what they\u2019re judging.\nDove is still less water soluble than most soap, but we\u2019re not soaking the bars first, so this should make for a more even comparison.\nThe pepper test is much less subjective. The reaction is highly visible and drastic. It either detects soap & soap scum or it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s not really any in-between.\nThis test determines the rinsing ability on actual skin, not a mirror.\nVERDICT: Claim #4 is totally false!\nMany thanks to Dr. Kevin Dunn for all of his hard work on this and many other projects in the field of soap-making. He\u2019s answered a lot of questions in this field that no one else has tackled. Here are the lecture notes I\u2019ve used for this article.

This is the visible result of the surfactant nature of soap.\nWhat Dr. Dunn did was take four groups of people and test four different kinds of cleansers: A handmade soap (his own blend he calls \u201cDelight\u201d), Dial, Dove, and Ivory. He then conducted a double-blind study using the method above (well, almost, he used a person\u2019s knuckle instead of the finger, to eliminate the chance of soap getting stuck under the fingernail and not rinsing easily).\nFirst he tested whether this method was able to detect invisible amounts of soap on your skin. Each of the four groups were able to detect invisible amounts of soap on the skin using this method.\nNext he ran the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under tap water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below. Remember this is a double-blind study, so no group is aware of which sample they are working with and judging.\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 2, 3, & 4 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 1 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nAt last, Dr. Dunn conducted the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under hard water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below:\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 1, 2, & 3 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 4 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nSo, does soap leave scum on your skin? The answer is no. However the results do bring some question as to whether Dove rinses cleanly all the time. It\u2019s not enough to just claim that Dove does not rinse cleanly, though it does make one curious.\nSome of you might be wondering \u201caren\u2019t you just testing for soap, not soap scum?\u201d It\u2019s a valid question. The answers is this test does detect soap scum, too. Soap scum actually contains soap, (it also technically is a type of calcium soap) so it will have the same surfactant effect on the peppered water as plain soap.\nLet\u2019s just recap this experiment in contrast with Dove\u2019s:\nThe person judging the experiment is unaware of what they\u2019re judging.\nDove is still less water soluble than most soap, but we\u2019re not soaking the bars first, so this should make for a more even comparison.\nThe pepper test is much less subjective. The reaction is highly visible and drastic. It either detects soap & soap scum or it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s not really any in-between.\nThis test determines the rinsing ability on actual skin, not a mirror.\nVERDICT: Claim #4 is totally false!\nMany thanks to Dr. Kevin Dunn for all of his hard work on this and many other projects in the field of soap-making.

I won\u2019t make any claims that I can\u2019t back up.\nNow, onto the ad. For this post I\u2019m going to be heavily referencing a lecture given by Dr. Kevin Dunn. Kevin has a PhD in chemistry and has been studying soap specifically for many years. He\u2019s already done the legwork here so instead of re-inventing the wheel I\u2019m going to walk you through what he\u2019s done.\nThe Dove ad makes a lot of claims. I\u2019m interested in four of them\n10 seconds into the video: \u201cSoap scum is the combination of soap materials in a normal cleansing bar with the calcium ions that come from hard water\u201d.\n26 seconds into the video: \u201cThe cleansing system in a Dove bar is fundamentally different from soap.\u201d\n32 seconds into the video: \u201cIt [Dove] also does not interact with calcium in the way that a soap would.\u201d\n37 seconds into the video: \u201cSoap leaves scum, and Dove doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nOk first things first. Claim #1:\n\u201cSoap scum is the combination of soap materials in a normal cleansing bar with the calcium ions that come from hard water\u201d.\nTo test this out, Kevin ran a quick experiment using calcium chloride and distilled water (he essentially made hard water). He then took two separate samples of this and mixed Ivory (a soap) into one, and Equate (a detergent) into another. Here is the result:\nYou can see that the soap did in fact form a white substance when mixed with the hard water, while the detergent did not. So far so good.\nVERDICT: Claim #1 is true.\nClaim #2:\n\u201cThe cleansing system in a Dove bar is fundamentally different from soap.\u201d\nFirst let\u2019s figure out what\u2019s actually in Dove. Might as well list out Ivory and Equate for comparison. Again, thanks to Dr. Dunn for breaking these down.\nIvory:\nSoap: sodium tallowate and/or sodium palmate,sodium cocoate and/or sodium palm kernelate\nFatty acids: coconut acid, palm kernel acid, tallow acid, palm acid\nOther: water, glycerin, sodium chloride (salt), fragrance, tetra- sodium edta\nEquate:\nDetergent: sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, co-camidopropyl betaine\nOther: Water, sodium chloride, fragrance, citric acid,\u2026(11more minor ingredients)\nDove:\nDetergent: sodium lauroyl isethionate, sodium isethionate, co-camidopropyl betaine, sodium C14-C16 olefin sulfonate\nSoap: sodium tallowate, sodium palmitate, sodium stearate, sodium cocoate, sodium palm kernelate\nFatty Acids: stearic acid, lauric acid\nOther: sodium EDTA and tetrasodium etidronate, water, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, and maltol\nUh Oh. Dove actually contains soap! So how is it fundamentally different from soap? This is a pretty misleading claim. I\u2019ll demonstrate next how dove and soap are not that different with respect to hard water.\nVERDICT: Claim #2 is at best misleading, and at worst actually false.\nClaim #3:\n\u201cIt [Dove] also does not interact with calcium in the way that a soap would.\u201d\nAlright, let\u2019s see what happens when we mix the same amount of Dove into the same solution of hard water:\nHmmmmm, that looks an awful lot like soap scum. That\u2019s because it is. Anything that has soap in it will interact with calcium and form \u201csoap scum\u201d. The soap in Dove interacts with the calcium in hard water, the detergent in Dove does not. Notice that the chunks in here are a little smaller than with the Ivory. So technically their claim is accurate. Dove does not interact with calcium in the same exact way as soap. It\u2019s a terribly misleading claim though, because they are implying that Dove doesn\u2019t interact with calcium at all, or that it\u2019s drastically different. In reality it\u2019s nearly the same interaction: it produced soap scum!\nVERDICT: Claim #3 is absolutely misleading.\nClaim #4:\n\u201cSoap leaves scum, Dove doesn\u2019t\u201d\nWe\u2019ve already established that Dove creates scum, but does it leave that scum behind on your skin? Does regular soap leave that scum behind on your skin? Dove attempted to answer this by testing how each one rinsed from a mirror.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the \u201cexperiment\u201d used in the ad. There are a few things that are rather unscientific about it, namely:\nThe person conducting the study knows which is Dove and which is soap.\nDove is less soluble in water than soap, so the soap is going to be softer after soaking in water. This means it\u2019s likely to leave a thicker film on the mirror than the Dove.\nJudging which one washed away faster or more completely is subjective.\nYour skin is not a mirror. Demonstrating the way soap and Dove rinse off a mirror doesn\u2019t really give any valuable insight into how these things rinse off of skin.\nDr. Dunn actually improved upon this test by using a double-blind method, using a specific pattern on the mirror to reduce subjectivity, using uniform sample sizes of the different soaps tested, and running the experiment four times with four different groups of people. While his conclusions showed that Dove and Soap require a similar amount of effort to rinse, the test was still pretty subjective, and it still didn\u2019t address how well Dove and Soap rinse from a person\u2019s skin.\nSo, Dr. Dunn came up with an even better experiment. It\u2019s a pretty neat test, and it\u2019s something you can try out yourself, too!\nSoap is a surfactant. This means it lowers the surface tension of lots of liquids. The one we\u2019re interested in is water. Take a bowl of water and sprinkle pepper evenly over the surface. Now just touch the surface of the water (make sure your hands are completely clean and dry). As you\u2019d expect, nothing happens. Now dry your finger off and swipe your finger across a dry bar of soap. You now have an invisible amount of soap on your skin. Touch the water again, and you\u2019ll see the pepper fly out to the edges of the bowl.

Again, thanks to Dr. Dunn for breaking these down.\nIvory:\nSoap: sodium tallowate and/or sodium palmate,sodium cocoate and/or sodium palm kernelate\nFatty acids: coconut acid, palm kernel acid, tallow acid, palm acid\nOther: water, glycerin, sodium chloride (salt), fragrance, tetra- sodium edta\nEquate:\nDetergent: sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, co-camidopropyl betaine\nOther: Water, sodium chloride, fragrance, citric acid,\u2026(11more minor ingredients)\nDove:\nDetergent: sodium lauroyl isethionate, sodium isethionate, co-camidopropyl betaine, sodium C14-C16 olefin sulfonate\nSoap: sodium tallowate, sodium palmitate, sodium stearate, sodium cocoate, sodium palm kernelate\nFatty Acids: stearic acid, lauric acid\nOther: sodium EDTA and tetrasodium etidronate, water, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, and maltol\nUh Oh. Dove actually contains soap! So how is it fundamentally different from soap? This is a pretty misleading claim. I\u2019ll demonstrate next how dove and soap are not that different with respect to hard water.\nVERDICT: Claim #2 is at best misleading, and at worst actually false.\nClaim #3:\n\u201cIt [Dove] also does not interact with calcium in the way that a soap would.\u201d\nAlright, let\u2019s see what happens when we mix the same amount of Dove into the same solution of hard water:\nHmmmmm, that looks an awful lot like soap scum. That\u2019s because it is. Anything that has soap in it will interact with calcium and form \u201csoap scum\u201d. The soap in Dove interacts with the calcium in hard water, the detergent in Dove does not. Notice that the chunks in here are a little smaller than with the Ivory. So technically their claim is accurate. Dove does not interact with calcium in the same exact way as soap. It\u2019s a terribly misleading claim though, because they are implying that Dove doesn\u2019t interact with calcium at all, or that it\u2019s drastically different. In reality it\u2019s nearly the same interaction: it produced soap scum!\nVERDICT: Claim #3 is absolutely misleading.\nClaim #4:\n\u201cSoap leaves scum, Dove doesn\u2019t\u201d\nWe\u2019ve already established that Dove creates scum, but does it leave that scum behind on your skin? Does regular soap leave that scum behind on your skin? Dove attempted to answer this by testing how each one rinsed from a mirror.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the \u201cexperiment\u201d used in the ad. There are a few things that are rather unscientific about it, namely:\nThe person conducting the study knows which is Dove and which is soap.\nDove is less soluble in water than soap, so the soap is going to be softer after soaking in water. This means it\u2019s likely to leave a thicker film on the mirror than the Dove.\nJudging which one washed away faster or more completely is subjective.\nYour skin is not a mirror. Demonstrating the way soap and Dove rinse off a mirror doesn\u2019t really give any valuable insight into how these things rinse off of skin.\nDr. Dunn actually improved upon this test by using a double-blind method, using a specific pattern on the mirror to reduce subjectivity, using uniform sample sizes of the different soaps tested, and running the experiment four times with four different groups of people. While his conclusions showed that Dove and Soap require a similar amount of effort to rinse, the test was still pretty subjective, and it still didn\u2019t address how well Dove and Soap rinse from a person\u2019s skin.\nSo, Dr. Dunn came up with an even better experiment. It\u2019s a pretty neat test, and it\u2019s something you can try out yourself, too!\nSoap is a surfactant. This means it lowers the surface tension of lots of liquids. The one we\u2019re interested in is water. Take a bowl of water and sprinkle pepper evenly over the surface. Now just touch the surface of the water (make sure your hands are completely clean and dry). As you\u2019d expect, nothing happens. Now dry your finger off and swipe your finger across a dry bar of soap. You now have an invisible amount of soap on your skin. Touch the water again, and you\u2019ll see the pepper fly out to the edges of the bowl. This is the visible result of the surfactant nature of soap.\nWhat Dr. Dunn did was take four groups of people and test four different kinds of cleansers: A handmade soap (his own blend he calls \u201cDelight\u201d), Dial, Dove, and Ivory. He then conducted a double-blind study using the method above (well, almost, he used a person\u2019s knuckle instead of the finger, to eliminate the chance of soap getting stuck under the fingernail and not rinsing easily).\nFirst he tested whether this method was able to detect invisible amounts of soap on your skin. Each of the four groups were able to detect invisible amounts of soap on the skin using this method.\nNext he ran the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under tap water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below. Remember this is a double-blind study, so no group is aware of which sample they are working with and judging.\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 2, 3, & 4 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 1 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nAt last, Dr. Dunn conducted the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under hard water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below:\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 1, 2, & 3 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 4 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nSo, does soap leave scum on your skin? The answer is no. However the results do bring some question as to whether Dove rinses cleanly all the time. It\u2019s not enough to just claim that Dove does not rinse cleanly, though it does make one curious.\nSome of you might be wondering \u201caren\u2019t you just testing for soap, not soap scum?\u201d It\u2019s a valid question.

The reaction is highly visible and drastic. It either detects soap & soap scum or it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s not really any in-between.\nThis test determines the rinsing ability on actual skin, not a mirror.\nVERDICT: Claim #4 is totally false!\nMany thanks to Dr. Kevin Dunn for all of his hard work on this and many other projects in the field of soap-making.

Dove actually contains soap! So how is it fundamentally different from soap? This is a pretty misleading claim. I\u2019ll demonstrate next how dove and soap are not that different with respect to hard water.\nVERDICT: Claim #2 is at best misleading, and at worst actually false.\nClaim #3:\n\u201cIt [Dove] also does not interact with calcium in the way that a soap would.\u201d\nAlright, let\u2019s see what happens when we mix the same amount of Dove into the same solution of hard water:\nHmmmmm, that looks an awful lot like soap scum. That\u2019s because it is. Anything that has soap in it will interact with calcium and form \u201csoap scum\u201d.

In reality it\u2019s nearly the same interaction: it produced soap scum!\nVERDICT: Claim #3 is absolutely misleading.\nClaim #4:\n\u201cSoap leaves scum, Dove doesn\u2019t\u201d\nWe\u2019ve already established that Dove creates scum, but does it leave that scum behind on your skin? Does regular soap leave that scum behind on your skin? Dove attempted to answer this by testing how each one rinsed from a mirror.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the \u201cexperiment\u201d used in the ad. There are a few things that are rather unscientific about it, namely:\nThe person conducting the study knows which is Dove and which is soap.\nDove is less soluble in water than soap, so the soap is going to be softer after soaking in water. This means it\u2019s likely to leave a thicker film on the mirror than the Dove.\nJudging which one washed away faster or more completely is subjective.\nYour skin is not a mirror. Demonstrating the way soap and Dove rinse off a mirror doesn\u2019t really give any valuable insight into how these things rinse off of skin.\nDr. Dunn actually improved upon this test by using a double-blind method, using a specific pattern on the mirror to reduce subjectivity, using uniform sample sizes of the different soaps tested, and running the experiment four times with four different groups of people. While his conclusions showed that Dove and Soap require a similar amount of effort to rinse, the test was still pretty subjective, and it still didn\u2019t address how well Dove and Soap rinse from a person\u2019s skin.\nSo, Dr. Dunn came up with an even better experiment. It\u2019s a pretty neat test, and it\u2019s something you can try out yourself, too!\nSoap is a surfactant. This means it lowers the surface tension of lots of liquids. The one we\u2019re interested in is water. Take a bowl of water and sprinkle pepper evenly over the surface. Now just touch the surface of the water (make sure your hands are completely clean and dry). As you\u2019d expect, nothing happens. Now dry your finger off and swipe your finger across a dry bar of soap. You now have an invisible amount of soap on your skin. Touch the water again, and you\u2019ll see the pepper fly out to the edges of the bowl. This is the visible result of the surfactant nature of soap.\nWhat Dr. Dunn did was take four groups of people and test four different kinds of cleansers: A handmade soap (his own blend he calls \u201cDelight\u201d), Dial, Dove, and Ivory. He then conducted a double-blind study using the method above (well, almost, he used a person\u2019s knuckle instead of the finger, to eliminate the chance of soap getting stuck under the fingernail and not rinsing easily).\nFirst he tested whether this method was able to detect invisible amounts of soap on your skin. Each of the four groups were able to detect invisible amounts of soap on the skin using this method.\nNext he ran the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under tap water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below. Remember this is a double-blind study, so no group is aware of which sample they are working with and judging.\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 2, 3, & 4 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 1 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nAt last, Dr. Dunn conducted the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under hard water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below:\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 1, 2, & 3 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 4 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nSo, does soap leave scum on your skin? The answer is no. However the results do bring some question as to whether Dove rinses cleanly all the time. It\u2019s not enough to just claim that Dove does not rinse cleanly, though it does make one curious.\nSome of you might be wondering \u201caren\u2019t you just testing for soap, not soap scum?\u201d It\u2019s a valid question. The answers is this test does detect soap scum, too. Soap scum actually contains soap, (it also technically is a type of calcium soap) so it will have the same surfactant effect on the peppered water as plain soap.\nLet\u2019s just recap this experiment in contrast with Dove\u2019s:\nThe person judging the experiment is unaware of what they\u2019re judging.\nDove is still less water soluble than most soap, but we\u2019re not soaking the bars first, so this should make for a more even comparison.\nThe pepper test is much less subjective. The reaction is highly visible and drastic. It either detects soap & soap scum or it doesn\u2019t.

While his conclusions showed that Dove and Soap require a similar amount of effort to rinse, the test was still pretty subjective, and it still didn\u2019t address how well Dove and Soap rinse from a person\u2019s skin.\nSo, Dr. Dunn came up with an even better experiment. It\u2019s a pretty neat test, and it\u2019s something you can try out yourself, too!\nSoap is a surfactant. This means it lowers the surface tension of lots of liquids. The one we\u2019re interested in is water. Take a bowl of water and sprinkle pepper evenly over the surface. Now just touch the surface of the water (make sure your hands are completely clean and dry). As you\u2019d expect, nothing happens. Now dry your finger off and swipe your finger across a dry bar of soap. You now have an invisible amount of soap on your skin. Touch the water again, and you\u2019ll see the pepper fly out to the edges of the bowl. This is the visible result of the surfactant nature of soap.\nWhat Dr. Dunn did was take four groups of people and test four different kinds of cleansers: A handmade soap (his own blend he calls \u201cDelight\u201d), Dial, Dove, and Ivory. He then conducted a double-blind study using the method above (well, almost, he used a person\u2019s knuckle instead of the finger, to eliminate the chance of soap getting stuck under the fingernail and not rinsing easily).\nFirst he tested whether this method was able to detect invisible amounts of soap on your skin. Each of the four groups were able to detect invisible amounts of soap on the skin using this method.\nNext he ran the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under tap water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below. Remember this is a double-blind study, so no group is aware of which sample they are working with and judging.\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 2, 3, & 4 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 1 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nAt last, Dr. Dunn conducted the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under hard water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below:\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 1, 2, & 3 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 4 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nSo, does soap leave scum on your skin? The answer is no. However the results do bring some question as to whether Dove rinses cleanly all the time.

I won\u2019t make any claims that I can\u2019t back up.\nNow, onto the ad. For this post I\u2019m going to be heavily referencing a lecture given by Dr. Kevin Dunn. Kevin has a PhD in chemistry and has been studying soap specifically for many years. He\u2019s already done the legwork here so instead of re-inventing the wheel I\u2019m going to walk you through what he\u2019s done.\nThe Dove ad makes a lot of claims. I\u2019m interested in four of them\n10 seconds into the video: \u201cSoap scum is the combination of soap materials in a normal cleansing bar with the calcium ions that come from hard water\u201d.\n26 seconds into the video: \u201cThe cleansing system in a Dove bar is fundamentally different from soap.\u201d\n32 seconds into the video: \u201cIt [Dove] also does not interact with calcium in the way that a soap would.\u201d\n37 seconds into the video: \u201cSoap leaves scum, and Dove doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nOk first things first. Claim #1:\n\u201cSoap scum is the combination of soap materials in a normal cleansing bar with the calcium ions that come from hard water\u201d.\nTo test this out, Kevin ran a quick experiment using calcium chloride and distilled water (he essentially made hard water). He then took two separate samples of this and mixed Ivory (a soap) into one, and Equate (a detergent) into another. Here is the result:\nYou can see that the soap did in fact form a white substance when mixed with the hard water, while the detergent did not. So far so good.\nVERDICT: Claim #1 is true.\nClaim #2:\n\u201cThe cleansing system in a Dove bar is fundamentally different from soap.\u201d\nFirst let\u2019s figure out what\u2019s actually in Dove. Might as well list out Ivory and Equate for comparison. Again, thanks to Dr. Dunn for breaking these down.\nIvory:\nSoap: sodium tallowate and/or sodium palmate,sodium cocoate and/or sodium palm kernelate\nFatty acids: coconut acid, palm kernel acid, tallow acid, palm acid\nOther: water, glycerin, sodium chloride (salt), fragrance, tetra- sodium edta\nEquate:\nDetergent: sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, co-camidopropyl betaine\nOther: Water, sodium chloride, fragrance, citric acid,\u2026(11more minor ingredients)\nDove:\nDetergent: sodium lauroyl isethionate, sodium isethionate, co-camidopropyl betaine, sodium C14-C16 olefin sulfonate\nSoap: sodium tallowate, sodium palmitate, sodium stearate, sodium cocoate, sodium palm kernelate\nFatty Acids: stearic acid, lauric acid\nOther: sodium EDTA and tetrasodium etidronate, water, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, and maltol\nUh Oh. Dove actually contains soap! So how is it fundamentally different from soap? This is a pretty misleading claim. I\u2019ll demonstrate next how dove and soap are not that different with respect to hard water.\nVERDICT: Claim #2 is at best misleading, and at worst actually false.\nClaim #3:\n\u201cIt [Dove] also does not interact with calcium in the way that a soap would.\u201d\nAlright, let\u2019s see what happens when we mix the same amount of Dove into the same solution of hard water:\nHmmmmm, that looks an awful lot like soap scum. That\u2019s because it is. Anything that has soap in it will interact with calcium and form \u201csoap scum\u201d. The soap in Dove interacts with the calcium in hard water, the detergent in Dove does not. Notice that the chunks in here are a little smaller than with the Ivory. So technically their claim is accurate. Dove does not interact with calcium in the same exact way as soap. It\u2019s a terribly misleading claim though, because they are implying that Dove doesn\u2019t interact with calcium at all, or that it\u2019s drastically different. In reality it\u2019s nearly the same interaction: it produced soap scum!\nVERDICT: Claim #3 is absolutely misleading.\nClaim #4:\n\u201cSoap leaves scum, Dove doesn\u2019t\u201d\nWe\u2019ve already established that Dove creates scum, but does it leave that scum behind on your skin? Does regular soap leave that scum behind on your skin? Dove attempted to answer this by testing how each one rinsed from a mirror.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the \u201cexperiment\u201d used in the ad. There are a few things that are rather unscientific about it, namely:\nThe person conducting the study knows which is Dove and which is soap.\nDove is less soluble in water than soap, so the soap is going to be softer after soaking in water. This means it\u2019s likely to leave a thicker film on the mirror than the Dove.\nJudging which one washed away faster or more completely is subjective.\nYour skin is not a mirror.

Claim #1:\n\u201cSoap scum is the combination of soap materials in a normal cleansing bar with the calcium ions that come from hard water\u201d.\nTo test this out, Kevin ran a quick experiment using calcium chloride and distilled water (he essentially made hard water). He then took two separate samples of this and mixed Ivory (a soap) into one, and Equate (a detergent) into another. Here is the result:\nYou can see that the soap did in fact form a white substance when mixed with the hard water, while the detergent did not. So far so good.\nVERDICT: Claim #1 is true.\nClaim #2:\n\u201cThe cleansing system in a Dove bar is fundamentally different from soap.\u201d\nFirst let\u2019s figure out what\u2019s actually in Dove. Might as well list out Ivory and Equate for comparison. Again, thanks to Dr. Dunn for breaking these down.\nIvory:\nSoap: sodium tallowate and/or sodium palmate,sodium cocoate and/or sodium palm kernelate\nFatty acids: coconut acid, palm kernel acid, tallow acid, palm acid\nOther: water, glycerin, sodium chloride (salt), fragrance, tetra- sodium edta\nEquate:\nDetergent: sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, co-camidopropyl betaine\nOther: Water, sodium chloride, fragrance, citric acid,\u2026(11more minor ingredients)\nDove:\nDetergent: sodium lauroyl isethionate, sodium isethionate, co-camidopropyl betaine, sodium C14-C16 olefin sulfonate\nSoap: sodium tallowate, sodium palmitate, sodium stearate, sodium cocoate, sodium palm kernelate\nFatty Acids: stearic acid, lauric acid\nOther: sodium EDTA and tetrasodium etidronate, water, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, and maltol\nUh Oh. Dove actually contains soap! So how is it fundamentally different from soap? This is a pretty misleading claim. I\u2019ll demonstrate next how dove and soap are not that different with respect to hard water.\nVERDICT: Claim #2 is at best misleading, and at worst actually false.\nClaim #3:\n\u201cIt [Dove] also does not interact with calcium in the way that a soap would.\u201d\nAlright, let\u2019s see what happens when we mix the same amount of Dove into the same solution of hard water:\nHmmmmm, that looks an awful lot like soap scum. That\u2019s because it is. Anything that has soap in it will interact with calcium and form \u201csoap scum\u201d. The soap in Dove interacts with the calcium in hard water, the detergent in Dove does not. Notice that the chunks in here are a little smaller than with the Ivory. So technically their claim is accurate. Dove does not interact with calcium in the same exact way as soap. It\u2019s a terribly misleading claim though, because they are implying that Dove doesn\u2019t interact with calcium at all, or that it\u2019s drastically different. In reality it\u2019s nearly the same interaction: it produced soap scum!\nVERDICT: Claim #3 is absolutely misleading.\nClaim #4:\n\u201cSoap leaves scum, Dove doesn\u2019t\u201d\nWe\u2019ve already established that Dove creates scum, but does it leave that scum behind on your skin? Does regular soap leave that scum behind on your skin? Dove attempted to answer this by testing how each one rinsed from a mirror.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the \u201cexperiment\u201d used in the ad. There are a few things that are rather unscientific about it, namely:\nThe person conducting the study knows which is Dove and which is soap.\nDove is less soluble in water than soap, so the soap is going to be softer after soaking in water. This means it\u2019s likely to leave a thicker film on the mirror than the Dove.\nJudging which one washed away faster or more completely is subjective.\nYour skin is not a mirror. Demonstrating the way soap and Dove rinse off a mirror doesn\u2019t really give any valuable insight into how these things rinse off of skin.\nDr. Dunn actually improved upon this test by using a double-blind method, using a specific pattern on the mirror to reduce subjectivity, using uniform sample sizes of the different soaps tested, and running the experiment four times with four different groups of people. While his conclusions showed that Dove and Soap require a similar amount of effort to rinse, the test was still pretty subjective, and it still didn\u2019t address how well Dove and Soap rinse from a person\u2019s skin.\nSo, Dr. Dunn came up with an even better experiment. It\u2019s a pretty neat test, and it\u2019s something you can try out yourself, too!\nSoap is a surfactant. This means it lowers the surface tension of lots of liquids. The one we\u2019re interested in is water. Take a bowl of water and sprinkle pepper evenly over the surface. Now just touch the surface of the water (make sure your hands are completely clean and dry). As you\u2019d expect, nothing happens. Now dry your finger off and swipe your finger across a dry bar of soap. You now have an invisible amount of soap on your skin. Touch the water again, and you\u2019ll see the pepper fly out to the edges of the bowl. This is the visible result of the surfactant nature of soap.\nWhat Dr. Dunn did was take four groups of people and test four different kinds of cleansers: A handmade soap (his own blend he calls \u201cDelight\u201d), Dial, Dove, and Ivory. He then conducted a double-blind study using the method above (well, almost, he used a person\u2019s knuckle instead of the finger, to eliminate the chance of soap getting stuck under the fingernail and not rinsing easily).\nFirst he tested whether this method was able to detect invisible amounts of soap on your skin. Each of the four groups were able to detect invisible amounts of soap on the skin using this method.\nNext he ran the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under tap water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below. Remember this is a double-blind study, so no group is aware of which sample they are working with and judging.\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 2, 3, & 4 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 1 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nAt last, Dr. Dunn conducted the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under hard water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below:\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 1, 2, & 3 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 4 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nSo, does soap leave scum on your skin? The answer is no. However the results do bring some question as to whether Dove rinses cleanly all the time. It\u2019s not enough to just claim that Dove does not rinse cleanly, though it does make one curious.\nSome of you might be wondering \u201caren\u2019t you just testing for soap, not soap scum?\u201d It\u2019s a valid question. The answers is this test does detect soap scum, too. Soap scum actually contains soap, (it also technically is a type of calcium soap) so it will have the same surfactant effect on the peppered water as plain soap.\nLet\u2019s just recap this experiment in contrast with Dove\u2019s:\nThe person judging the experiment is unaware of what they\u2019re judging.\nDove is still less water soluble than most soap, but we\u2019re not soaking the bars first, so this should make for a more even comparison.\nThe pepper test is much less subjective. The reaction is highly visible and drastic. It either detects soap & soap scum or it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s not really any in-between.\nThis test determines the rinsing ability on actual skin, not a mirror.\nVERDICT: Claim #4 is totally false!\nMany thanks to Dr. Kevin Dunn for all of his hard work on this and many other projects in the field of soap-making. He\u2019s answered a lot of questions in this field that no one else has tackled. Here are the lecture notes I\u2019ve used for this article.

Claim #1:\n\u201cSoap scum is the combination of soap materials in a normal cleansing bar with the calcium ions that come from hard water\u201d.\nTo test this out, Kevin ran a quick experiment using calcium chloride and distilled water (he essentially made hard water). He then took two separate samples of this and mixed Ivory (a soap) into one, and Equate (a detergent) into another. Here is the result:\nYou can see that the soap did in fact form a white substance when mixed with the hard water, while the detergent did not.

Might as well list out Ivory and Equate for comparison.

Dove actually contains soap! So how is it fundamentally different from soap? This is a pretty misleading claim. I\u2019ll demonstrate next how dove and soap are not that different with respect to hard water.\nVERDICT: Claim #2 is at best misleading, and at worst actually false.\nClaim #3:\n\u201cIt [Dove] also does not interact with calcium in the way that a soap would.\u201d\nAlright, let\u2019s see what happens when we mix the same amount of Dove into the same solution of hard water:\nHmmmmm, that looks an awful lot like soap scum. That\u2019s because it is. Anything that has soap in it will interact with calcium and form \u201csoap scum\u201d. The soap in Dove interacts with the calcium in hard water, the detergent in Dove does not. Notice that the chunks in here are a little smaller than with the Ivory. So technically their claim is accurate. Dove does not interact with calcium in the same exact way as soap. It\u2019s a terribly misleading claim though, because they are implying that Dove doesn\u2019t interact with calcium at all, or that it\u2019s drastically different. In reality it\u2019s nearly the same interaction: it produced soap scum!\nVERDICT: Claim #3 is absolutely misleading.\nClaim #4:\n\u201cSoap leaves scum, Dove doesn\u2019t\u201d\nWe\u2019ve already established that Dove creates scum, but does it leave that scum behind on your skin? Does regular soap leave that scum behind on your skin? Dove attempted to answer this by testing how each one rinsed from a mirror.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the \u201cexperiment\u201d used in the ad. There are a few things that are rather unscientific about it, namely:\nThe person conducting the study knows which is Dove and which is soap.\nDove is less soluble in water than soap, so the soap is going to be softer after soaking in water. This means it\u2019s likely to leave a thicker film on the mirror than the Dove.\nJudging which one washed away faster or more completely is subjective.\nYour skin is not a mirror. Demonstrating the way soap and Dove rinse off a mirror doesn\u2019t really give any valuable insight into how these things rinse off of skin.\nDr. Dunn actually improved upon this test by using a double-blind method, using a specific pattern on the mirror to reduce subjectivity, using uniform sample sizes of the different soaps tested, and running the experiment four times with four different groups of people. While his conclusions showed that Dove and Soap require a similar amount of effort to rinse, the test was still pretty subjective, and it still didn\u2019t address how well Dove and Soap rinse from a person\u2019s skin.\nSo, Dr. Dunn came up with an even better experiment. It\u2019s a pretty neat test, and it\u2019s something you can try out yourself, too!\nSoap is a surfactant. This means it lowers the surface tension of lots of liquids. The one we\u2019re interested in is water. Take a bowl of water and sprinkle pepper evenly over the surface. Now just touch the surface of the water (make sure your hands are completely clean and dry). As you\u2019d expect, nothing happens. Now dry your finger off and swipe your finger across a dry bar of soap. You now have an invisible amount of soap on your skin. Touch the water again, and you\u2019ll see the pepper fly out to the edges of the bowl. This is the visible result of the surfactant nature of soap.\nWhat Dr. Dunn did was take four groups of people and test four different kinds of cleansers: A handmade soap (his own blend he calls \u201cDelight\u201d), Dial, Dove, and Ivory. He then conducted a double-blind study using the method above (well, almost, he used a person\u2019s knuckle instead of the finger, to eliminate the chance of soap getting stuck under the fingernail and not rinsing easily).\nFirst he tested whether this method was able to detect invisible amounts of soap on your skin. Each of the four groups were able to detect invisible amounts of soap on the skin using this method.\nNext he ran the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under tap water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below. Remember this is a double-blind study, so no group is aware of which sample they are working with and judging.\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 2, 3, & 4 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 1 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nAt last, Dr. Dunn conducted the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under hard water before testing it on the pepper.

It\u2019s a terribly misleading claim though, because they are implying that Dove doesn\u2019t interact with calcium at all, or that it\u2019s drastically different. In reality it\u2019s nearly the same interaction: it produced soap scum!\nVERDICT: Claim #3 is absolutely misleading.\nClaim #4:\n\u201cSoap leaves scum, Dove doesn\u2019t\u201d\nWe\u2019ve already established that Dove creates scum, but does it leave that scum behind on your skin? Does regular soap leave that scum behind on your skin? Dove attempted to answer this by testing how each one rinsed from a mirror.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the \u201cexperiment\u201d used in the ad. There are a few things that are rather unscientific about it, namely:\nThe person conducting the study knows which is Dove and which is soap.\nDove is less soluble in water than soap, so the soap is going to be softer after soaking in water. This means it\u2019s likely to leave a thicker film on the mirror than the Dove.\nJudging which one washed away faster or more completely is subjective.\nYour skin is not a mirror. Demonstrating the way soap and Dove rinse off a mirror doesn\u2019t really give any valuable insight into how these things rinse off of skin.\nDr. Dunn actually improved upon this test by using a double-blind method, using a specific pattern on the mirror to reduce subjectivity, using uniform sample sizes of the different soaps tested, and running the experiment four times with four different groups of people. While his conclusions showed that Dove and Soap require a similar amount of effort to rinse, the test was still pretty subjective, and it still didn\u2019t address how well Dove and Soap rinse from a person\u2019s skin.\nSo, Dr. Dunn came up with an even better experiment. It\u2019s a pretty neat test, and it\u2019s something you can try out yourself, too!\nSoap is a surfactant. This means it lowers the surface tension of lots of liquids. The one we\u2019re interested in is water. Take a bowl of water and sprinkle pepper evenly over the surface. Now just touch the surface of the water (make sure your hands are completely clean and dry). As you\u2019d expect, nothing happens. Now dry your finger off and swipe your finger across a dry bar of soap. You now have an invisible amount of soap on your skin. Touch the water again, and you\u2019ll see the pepper fly out to the edges of the bowl. This is the visible result of the surfactant nature of soap.\nWhat Dr. Dunn did was take four groups of people and test four different kinds of cleansers: A handmade soap (his own blend he calls \u201cDelight\u201d), Dial, Dove, and Ivory. He then conducted a double-blind study using the method above (well, almost, he used a person\u2019s knuckle instead of the finger, to eliminate the chance of soap getting stuck under the fingernail and not rinsing easily).\nFirst he tested whether this method was able to detect invisible amounts of soap on your skin. Each of the four groups were able to detect invisible amounts of soap on the skin using this method.\nNext he ran the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under tap water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below. Remember this is a double-blind study, so no group is aware of which sample they are working with and judging.\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 2, 3, & 4 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 1 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nAt last, Dr. Dunn conducted the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under hard water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below:\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 1, 2, & 3 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 4 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nSo, does soap leave scum on your skin? The answer is no. However the results do bring some question as to whether Dove rinses cleanly all the time. It\u2019s not enough to just claim that Dove does not rinse cleanly, though it does make one curious.\nSome of you might be wondering \u201caren\u2019t you just testing for soap, not soap scum?\u201d It\u2019s a valid question.

The reaction is highly visible and drastic. It either detects soap & soap scum or it doesn\u2019t.

He\u2019s already done the legwork here so instead of re-inventing the wheel I\u2019m going to walk you through what he\u2019s done.\nThe Dove ad makes a lot of claims. I\u2019m interested in four of them\n10 seconds into the video: \u201cSoap scum is the combination of soap materials in a normal cleansing bar with the calcium ions that come from hard water\u201d.\n26 seconds into the video: \u201cThe cleansing system in a Dove bar is fundamentally different from soap.\u201d\n32 seconds into the video: \u201cIt [Dove] also does not interact with calcium in the way that a soap would.\u201d\n37 seconds into the video: \u201cSoap leaves scum, and Dove doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nOk first things first. Claim #1:\n\u201cSoap scum is the combination of soap materials in a normal cleansing bar with the calcium ions that come from hard water\u201d.\nTo test this out, Kevin ran a quick experiment using calcium chloride and distilled water (he essentially made hard water). He then took two separate samples of this and mixed Ivory (a soap) into one, and Equate (a detergent) into another. Here is the result:\nYou can see that the soap did in fact form a white substance when mixed with the hard water, while the detergent did not.

Dove actually contains soap! So how is it fundamentally different from soap? This is a pretty misleading claim. I\u2019ll demonstrate next how dove and soap are not that different with respect to hard water.\nVERDICT: Claim #2 is at best misleading, and at worst actually false.\nClaim #3:\n\u201cIt [Dove] also does not interact with calcium in the way that a soap would.\u201d\nAlright, let\u2019s see what happens when we mix the same amount of Dove into the same solution of hard water:\nHmmmmm, that looks an awful lot like soap scum. That\u2019s because it is. Anything that has soap in it will interact with calcium and form \u201csoap scum\u201d. The soap in Dove interacts with the calcium in hard water, the detergent in Dove does not. Notice that the chunks in here are a little smaller than with the Ivory. So technically their claim is accurate. Dove does not interact with calcium in the same exact way as soap. It\u2019s a terribly misleading claim though, because they are implying that Dove doesn\u2019t interact with calcium at all, or that it\u2019s drastically different. In reality it\u2019s nearly the same interaction: it produced soap scum!\nVERDICT: Claim #3 is absolutely misleading.\nClaim #4:\n\u201cSoap leaves scum, Dove doesn\u2019t\u201d\nWe\u2019ve already established that Dove creates scum, but does it leave that scum behind on your skin? Does regular soap leave that scum behind on your skin? Dove attempted to answer this by testing how each one rinsed from a mirror.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the \u201cexperiment\u201d used in the ad. There are a few things that are rather unscientific about it, namely:\nThe person conducting the study knows which is Dove and which is soap.\nDove is less soluble in water than soap, so the soap is going to be softer after soaking in water. This means it\u2019s likely to leave a thicker film on the mirror than the Dove.\nJudging which one washed away faster or more completely is subjective.\nYour skin is not a mirror. Demonstrating the way soap and Dove rinse off a mirror doesn\u2019t really give any valuable insight into how these things rinse off of skin.\nDr. Dunn actually improved upon this test by using a double-blind method, using a specific pattern on the mirror to reduce subjectivity, using uniform sample sizes of the different soaps tested, and running the experiment four times with four different groups of people. While his conclusions showed that Dove and Soap require a similar amount of effort to rinse, the test was still pretty subjective, and it still didn\u2019t address how well Dove and Soap rinse from a person\u2019s skin.\nSo, Dr. Dunn came up with an even better experiment. It\u2019s a pretty neat test, and it\u2019s something you can try out yourself, too!\nSoap is a surfactant. This means it lowers the surface tension of lots of liquids. The one we\u2019re interested in is water. Take a bowl of water and sprinkle pepper evenly over the surface. Now just touch the surface of the water (make sure your hands are completely clean and dry). As you\u2019d expect, nothing happens. Now dry your finger off and swipe your finger across a dry bar of soap. You now have an invisible amount of soap on your skin. Touch the water again, and you\u2019ll see the pepper fly out to the edges of the bowl. This is the visible result of the surfactant nature of soap.\nWhat Dr. Dunn did was take four groups of people and test four different kinds of cleansers: A handmade soap (his own blend he calls \u201cDelight\u201d), Dial, Dove, and Ivory. He then conducted a double-blind study using the method above (well, almost, he used a person\u2019s knuckle instead of the finger, to eliminate the chance of soap getting stuck under the fingernail and not rinsing easily).\nFirst he tested whether this method was able to detect invisible amounts of soap on your skin. Each of the four groups were able to detect invisible amounts of soap on the skin using this method.\nNext he ran the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under tap water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below. Remember this is a double-blind study, so no group is aware of which sample they are working with and judging.\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 2, 3, & 4 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 1 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nAt last, Dr. Dunn conducted the experiment again, this time rinsing the hand for 30 seconds under hard water before testing it on the pepper. The results are below:\nDelight: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDial: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nDove: Groups 1, 2, & 3 were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin, but group 4 did observe that there was some soap left on the skin.\nIvory: All four groups were unable to detect any soap remaining on the skin after rinsing.\nSo, does soap leave scum on your skin? The answer is no. However the results do bring some question as to whether Dove rinses cleanly all the time. It\u2019s not enough to just claim that Dove does not rinse cleanly, though it does make one curious.\nSome of you might be wondering \u201caren\u2019t you just testing for soap, not soap scum?\u201d It\u2019s a valid question. The answers is this test does detect soap scum, too. Soap scum actually contains soap, (it also technically is a type of calcium soap) so it will have the same surfactant effect on the peppered water as plain soap.\nLet\u2019s just recap this experiment in contrast with Dove\u2019s:\nThe person judging the experiment is unaware of what they\u2019re judging.\nDove is still less water soluble than most soap, but we\u2019re not soaking the bars first, so this should make for a more even comparison.\nThe pepper test is much less subjective. The reaction is highly visible and drastic. It either detects soap & soap scum or it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s not really any in-between.\nThis test determines the rinsing ability on actual skin, not a mirror.\nVERDICT: Claim #4 is totally false!\nMany thanks to Dr. Kevin Dunn for all of his hard work on this and many other projects in the field of soap-making.

About 40 is ideal. The heart and arteries do not like excessive differences between systolic and diastolic pressures. So it is generally better to have a BP of 140/100 than to have a BP of 160/80.\nA blood pressure around about 120/80 is pretty well perfect. Blood pressure such as 110/60, or lower, may contribute to poor concentration, feeling light headed upon standing up and feeling excessively tired at times. Pressures that persistently exceed 140/90 will be detrimental to health over time.\nThe trend of advice from heart experts is to progressively lower the bar as to what is ideal BP. Advice varies; but the current trend is to recommend a blood pressure of about 110/70 to 100/60. I am inclined to disagree. 100/60 is too low and indicates poor health. Health advice that is geared towards preventing a singular disease, such as heart attack, can cause more problems down the line because human beings are exceedingly complex creatures. Anything less than a holistic approach will not improve overall health.\nThere is plenty of evidence that the lower the BP, the lower the risk of heart attack; but there is the downside of low blood pressure causing, or making worse, conditions like muddled thinking, excessive fatigue and dizziness. These can have a profound negative effect on a person's quality of life; especially in old age. Low blood pressure, including medications to lower blood pressure, increase the chances that an elderly person will be involved in car accidents and injury by falling.\nSo, an elderly lady on blood pressure medication may be less likely to die of a heart attack. This is good for the heart disease statistics. Instead, she has a dizzy spell, trips, breaks a hip and then dies slowly and miserably of pneumonia.\nBe wary of single issue health advice.

However, a recent study, published in Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ), states that researchers have found that salt levels in fast foods sold by 6 major companies vary considerably, indicating that technical issues are not the problem.\nSalt content of 2,124 food items in 7 product categories; french fries, burgers, pizza, salads, savory breakfast items, chicken products and sandwiches - from 6 companies - were examined by researchers from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and France.\nThe following companies were examined by the team:\nDomino's Pizza\nBurger King (known as Hungry Jack's in Australia)\nSubway\nKentucky Fried Chicken\nConsuming too much salt can cause higher blood pressure, as well as other adverse health effects. According to estimates, a significant number of deaths could be prevented by reducing salt intake and salt reduction efforts have been enforced in several countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Japan and Finland.\nFurthermore, recent voluntary salt reduction targets in place, or labeling for some types of food, have been successful. According to the researchers, technical food processing issues have been cited by food companies as barriers in lowering salt content, claiming that new technology and processes are required in order to produce lower-salt products.\nThe researchers found that between countries salt levels in similar foods varied considerably, with fast foods in the UK and France containing significantly lower levels of salt than in Canada and the United States.\nIn the UK, McDonald's Chicken McNuggets contained 240 mg sodium (0.6g salt) per 100 g in servings vs. 600 mg (1.5g salt) per 100 g serving in Canada.\nDr. Norman Campbell, University of Calgary and his co-authors, said:\n\"We saw marked variability in the reported salt content of products provided by major transnational fast food companies.\nCanadian companies indicate they have been working to reduce sodium but the high sodium in these foods indicates voluntary efforts aren't working.\nThese high levels indicate failure of the current government approach that leaves salt reduction solely in the hands of industry. Salt reduction programs need to guide industry and oversee it with targets and timelines for foods, monitoring and evaluation, and stronger regulatory measures if the structured voluntary efforts are not effective.\"\nAccording to the researchers, this is an opportunity for extensive reformulation of products to contain lower levels of sodium. In addition, this change could be gradually introduced over several years, in order to keep consumer backlash to a minimum.\nThe researchers conclude:\n\"Decreasing salt in fast foods would appear to be technically feasible and is likely to produce important gains in population health - the mean salt levels of fast foods are high, and these foods are eaten often.\"\nWritten By Grace Rattue\nElizabeth Dunford, Jacqueline Webster, Mark Woodward, Sebastien Czernichow, Wen Lun Yuan, Katharine Jenner, Cliona Ni Mhurchu, Michael Jacobson, Norm Campbell, and Bruce Neal\nCMAJ, April 2012, doi: 10.1503/cmaj.111895\nPlease use one of the following formats to cite this article in your essay, paper or report:\nMLA\nGrace Rattue. \"Fast Food Salt Levels - Big Difference Between North America And Europe.\" Medical News Today.

Business MUST be regulated by government or they will be the death of us, our environment and themselves. And the regulating government bodies must be adequately funded to do their job and also be free of industry influence and corruption. Our lives and the quality of our lives depend on effective regulation - before it's really too late.\nThis time we need government mandate\nposted by Lee Parker on 16 Apr 2012 at 12:54 pm\nI was diagnosed with high blood pressure and put on the usual meds. When I read about HB and salt, I pretty much eliminated it. My blood pressure went so low I had to get off the meds or pass out. As a result, I no longer eat processed or fast foods. Is this really what these companies want--to die a natural death because of salt content???\nReduce the high sodium content in not just Fast Food ....\nposted by Janet Cassetta on 16 Apr 2012 at 12:58 pm\nIf you leave the reduction of salt to the individual companies, the levels will NEVER be lowered. Anyone who tries to consciously watch their sodium intake, whether it's in Fast Food or food purchased at the grocery store will be as overwhelmed and frustrated as I am at the enormous amount of sodium in everyday items such as bread, pasta, lunch meat, and cheese, just ot name a few. I can't understand why we are told to reduce our sodium intake to prevent high blood pressure and heart disease and find it almost IMPOSSIBLE to find low or lower salt in the items we use on a daily basis. Take a trip down your local grocery store aisles and check the labels on EVERYTHING.....it's SHOCKING!\nCanadian Study Finds Some Variability Of Salt Levels In Fast Foods Across 6 Countries: But All Are Too High\nposted by Dr Carol Manser Addiction Rehab Now on 19 Apr 2012 at 7:57 pm\nA recent original research article published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal studied the salt levels in various fast foods in 6 different countries. When I looked at their results, there were definitely differences across these 6 countries, but the most striking finding, for me, was that these differences were minimal - and that they were all much too high for good health outcomes.\nSome countries advise their populations to keep daily consumption below 2,500 mg per day but some countries are now trying to reduce this target to 1,500 mg per day, especially if you have high blood pressure, cardiac failure or kidney disease.\nThese targets are virtually impossible to achieve unless you eat only fresh produce and add minimal salt, or salt based ingredients such as soy sauce, fish sauce etc, during cooking.\nBut, at least in Australia, as soon as you have a breakfast serial (~ 400mg/100g), or a slice of toast (400 mg /100g) and put almost anything on it (margarine 350mg/100g, or peanut butter 691mg/100g), you are already heading towards your daily limit, if not already over it.\nAnd even supposing you would never have fast food for lunch, you might want to have an instant cup of soup for lunch (370mg/100g = 780mg per serve). If you do succumb to that temptation, you should know you will be taking your life in your hands. Or, if you go out and buy a salad sandwich with any sort of dressing on it, the same story - it\u2019s virtually impossible to meet the recommended guidelines with the salt levels so high in everything we buy.\nBy the time you get to the evening meal you\u2019d have to munching on a carrot or a lettuce leaf - and even these have some naturally occurring sodium in them.\nIn Australia, there are some low-salt products available, but not nearly enough, and even these are higher than they should be if you want to look after your health. As for eating out in restaurants, it\u2019s a nightmare. It\u2019s a complete lottery as to whether the food served to you is even edible because of the widespread over-salting of food.\nAs medical students we were taught that the taste buds acclimatize to high salt levels over time - the more you have on a regular basis over time, the less salty, the food seems to become. Your taste buds down-regulate. Therefore you have to keep adding more and more salt to food over time, to get the same subjective saltiness level.\nIn the case of restaurants, it\u2019s understandable that chefs are always striving for increased flavor in their food, so they add more and more salt-based ingredients to keep achieving what they personally taste as, \u2018perfectly salted\u2019 food. But for anyone used to lower levels of salt in their food, restaurant food can be so salty, it borders on inedible.\nThe problem is not easy to fix. Public education would be a good start, because if the consumer is preferentially buying low salt products, the manufacturers will respond with lower salt levels.\nThat would be the ideal way of lowering salt levels in all processed foods, but this policy has been in place on many government\u2019s wish list, and failing, for years. It is not working at a population level. And manufacturers are never going to prejudice their sales figures by reducing salt in their products \u2018because it\u2019s good for us\u2019.\nFor a start, labeling should be mandatory, regulated, standardized (font size, color contrast with background color, units of measurement), easily visible, checked for adherence to the law, and with hefty fines for non-compliance. At least then, the consumer would know what they were eating.\nAn opportunity for the consumer to exercise informed choice would be a wonderful thing\nAn Opinion about: The variability of reported salt levels in fast foods across six countries: opportunities for salt reduction CMAJ cmaj.111895; published ahead of print April 16, 2012, doi:10.1503/cmaj.111895\nAdd Your Opinion On This Article\n'Fast Food Salt Levels - Big Difference Between North America And Europe'\nPlease note that we publish your name, but we do not publish your email address.

In lay-men language you can say this is the irritative behavior of the body! There are some cells which are designated to protect the body and to fight against the invadors inside the body. These cells are well equiped to eat up and kill. Once these cells are active and known to some kind of invasion inside the body, these start creating an atmosphere to fight against the invadors.

Kolbjorn has inspired me to change my career - owning my own small business as well as training to become an aromatherapist. Kolbjorn's excellent recipes have helped my family members with eczema so I, like Kolbjorn, believe EVERY inch in what I produce and sell. I have witnessed others in his classes go from dabbling in MYO cosmetics part-time' to 'owning their own cosmetic empires'.

All in all a fantastic book and one I will always use.\"\nDebra Solomon\n\"Hello Louise, I absolutely loved Kolbjorn's new book on vegetable oils. Concise and with a great deal of information I know its going to a reference book that I shall be keeping close to hand. The different recipes are very easy to make, and I love the thought of using such natural ingredients. I shall be using the information to benefit my clients and to be able to give them blends to take home and use is excellent. It was so interesting to read about long and short oils, information that can make such a difference to a masssage treatment and facials. I think Kolbjorn's enthusiasm shines through the book, and having met him at a couple of therapy shows I know how helpful and knowledgeable he is. If you can use any of this, please feel free. It really is a brilliant book.\"\nGillian Greening\n\"I am so glad I ordered the latest book. I have all of Kolbjorn's books and have found them invaluable. This new book is, once again, clear and easy to read. It gives all the information you would need to immediately adapt your recipes for your clients. I can't wait to start making some of the recipes and to attend the new course. Thank you once again Kolbjorn and all your team. You are an inspiration.

A prize for Most Hostile Driver of the Year.\nIn fact, I hereby announce the creation of such a prize. And the inaugural winner.\nYeah, I know, it's only May. But Conner Harris, of Monroe, Louisiana, has got it sewn up after a little encounter with a runner on Sunday.\nFrom a news article in thenewsstar.com :\nAccording to an arrest affadavit, the victim called Ouachita Parish Sheriff's deputies to the intersection of Stubbs Richie and Stubbs Vinson roads after several confrontations with Conner Harris, 107 Hideaway Drive, Monroe. The victim told police that he was running on the shoulder of Louisiana 594 near McGowan Road, in the opposing lane, when he was forced to jump off the road to avoid being hit by a pickup driven by Harris.\nWhat's that? You've seen worse? You yourself have been forced off the road by an angry (or just clueless) driver, maybe as recently as this morning? Well, hold your horses. I'm not done yet. And neither was Harris.\nThe article continues:\nHe said Harris then made an abrupt stop, squealing his tires as he put the vehicle in reverse to come back to the victim's location. Harris exited the vehicle and began yelling obscenities at the victim, threatening to beat him, and at one point during the rant saying he would \"kill him.\"\n(And I don't think that last part means that Harris made air-quotes with his fingers when he used the word \"kill.\")\nStill think you can top that? Wait -- there's more!\nThe victim said he then continued his run, when about 15 minutes later, Harris truck approached him again on Stubbs Richie near Louisiana 594. The victim said Harris was driving east on the shoulder of the westbound side of the road and drove along side the victim yelling obscenities.\nSee, this is the sort of perseverance and dedication to craft that separates a master from your everyday horn-honker or \"Run, Forrest!\"-screamer. \"Get off the road\"? Psssh. A raised middle finger? Please.\nA guy like Harris truly \"raises the bar\" for all other hostile drivers. And then uses that bar to take a swing at police officers who arrive on the scene.\nSpeaking of which: Cops later arrested Harris on a slew of charges, including aggravated assault with a vehicle.\nMr. Harris, your prize is on the way.\nOther hostile drivers: Good luck topping this.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged hostile drivers , motorists , road rage , running safety .

Cryosurgery requires the location of the liver spot and the layers under and around to be numbed with a freezing agent, then a scalpel is used to surgically remove all skin layers affected by the liver spot.

To their embarrassment, they're also still being punished for not losing enough weight.\nDon't you agree that the show would have been so much more interesting if the script writers had given us more insight into the lives of the contestants, instead of merely concentrating on their exercise programmes?\nI'm getting more and more irritated as the weeks go by. I want to know what the participants are eating, if they're using a balanced diet that's based on all the food groups, whether they're on starvation diets or following high-protein diets. Do they use shakes as meal replacers and do they eat three or six meals a day?\nBut, to date, we haven't seen a glimpse of what they're eating \u0096 just their worried faces as they peer through a fridge loaded with 'forbidden delights', as well as comment on team strategies and pet hates.\nWhat do they feel?\nAnother aspect that frustrates me is that we're never given insight into how the participants are feeling about the programme and the weight loss they've achieved (or haven\u0092t achieved).\nThere are no interviews with selected participants to find out if they're finding it hard or frustrating, if they're able to stick to their diets, if they're hungry or craving specific foods, or if they're feeling humiliated, angry or depressed.\nAll of these things would make for fascinating viewing and help to make the contestants appear more human.\nInsight for viewers\nAnother aspect that's totally neglected is providing viewers with some relevant insights into weight loss and how the human body reacts to changes in physical activity and diet adjustments.\nWhy, for example, are some participants not losing more weight on this draconian schedule? Is it possible that Mhpo, who only managed to lose 0.1kg during last week has an underlying problem such as insulin resistance? And why did Shakeel manage to lose a whopping 3.8kg in the same period?\nAll these questions remain unanswered.\nGimmicks\nInstead, the programme concentrates on gimmicky intrigues as the Blue and the Red Team try to sabotage each other's successes. This is of course the standard format of all reality shows such as Survivor, The Amazing Race etc. But why anyone who has put so much effort into losing weight should be disqualified because the opposition managed to win a boat race is beyond me.\nYes, I know that life is tough and unfair, but this artificial and random interference smacks of throwing slaves to the lions in the Colosseum to provide popular entertainment for the masses.\nThis is probably the basic format for such shows: put two groups of people into some or other strange situation (marooned on a desert island, locked up in a house, sailing on a pirate ship), add some random interference like being voted out in shame no matter how hard you have tried, and you've created an entertaining programme.\nWe know it works, but surely there are other good examples of programmes, with other emphases, that provide more interesting info. A good example is the BBC's 'The Truth About Food', which at least gives the audience more insight into problems associated with weight loss.\nThose ads!\nAn article by Wendy Knowler, published in the Pretoria News last week, correctly pointed out that the ads sandwiched in between 'The Biggest Loser SA' leave much to be desired.\nWe all know that most programmes need sponsors to cover their costs in exchange for exposure. But what TV stations evidently don't consider is that certain ads are highly inappropriate when aired together with specific subjects.\nHere we have a programme that's supposedly showing South Africans how to lose weight appropriately, combined with a variety of ads for high-fat, high-energy foods such as McDonald's and Coke, or slimming products that make unrealistic claims.\nWendy Knowler quotes Prof Tessa van der Merwe, chairperson of the South African Society of Obesity, who says that the show and these ads could \"undo the work we have been trying to do for 10 years, which is to spread the word that these products don't work and could even be dangerous.\"\nAre you watching? Then you're probably getting the following messages:\nWeight loss only requires 5-6 hours of super strenuous exercise a day. This is a fallacy as sustained weight loss is achieved by a combination of an energy-reduced, balanced diet and exercise.\nNo matter how hard you try, you'll fail to lose weight due to random factors such as team mates voting you off the programme. This sends the wrong message to anyone who wants to lose weight.\nThe slimming products advertised along with the programme will help you to lose weight. This is untrue, because there's no scientific evidence to suggest that any of these products can make a difference in terms of weight loss, or that they're safe to use.\nIn my opinion, the biggest loser so far is not one of the contestants, but the actual TV show!\n- (Dr I.V. van Heerden, DietDoc, January 2008)\n"}], [{"score": 433.58627, "uuid": "f1b4fadb-6a34-5b89-bc11-90a79b88dd1c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0007wb-78-23631", "target_hostname": "psoriasis.about.com", "target_uri": "http://psoriasis.about.com/b/2008/02/15/its-in-the-genes.htm", "page_rank": 1.1795181e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "It&#x27;s in <em>the</em> Genes!", "snippet": "<em>The</em> last study I&quot;ll mention today found that genetic <em>differences</em> not only accounted for variations in <em>the</em> benefits of <em>the</em> drug methotrexate, but also in <em>the</em> unwanted toxicity of this drug.

In this corner of cyberspace\u00a0the event invariably ends up in\u00a0a virtual bloody brawl.\nEvery year I set out the benefits of a meat-free (or at least meat-light) diet, and every year the red-fanged carnivores descend on me and the few tender sprouts of readers who spring up in my defence.\nIt\u2019s getting tiresome. So for a change I\u2019m not going to punt the well-worn pro-veg arguments (health-environment-economy-ethics),\u00a0but rather\u00a0focus our energies \u2013 everybody, omnivores and herbivores all together please \u2013 on resolving the following issue: if vegetarianism is so great (you know it is), why are there still so few of us?\nThe stats aren\u2019t too crisp on this, but\u00a0estimates put the percentage of true vegetarians in the single digits. As for semi-vegetarians*, in the Western world they make up only around 10% . (Vegetarian figures in India, China\u00a0and the East generally are\u00a0a little\u00a0healthier.)\nThe point being: even when we include people who make any sort of effort to avoid ingesting animals, the global numbers are pretty pathetic. (Particularly male numbers, I might add: there are more female vegetarians. One reason for this being no doubt that many men, and others,\u00a0entertain the\u00a0fanciful\u00a0notion that meat is specially potent, and that eating other animals\u2019 muscles -- especially other mammals\u2019 muscles -- is necessary to make you big and strong.)\nClearly, the Word is not being heard by the billions of unconverted. And one important aspect of the Word is that choosing to avoid meat is not only worthy, it also has the potential to make you, and life, more interesting.\nLet me explain what I mean by \u201cmore interesting\u201d: when you make a conscious effort to step outside the conventional majority and make a fundamental change in how you live \u2013 whether it's about what you eat, how you commute, or which products you spend your mighty consumer buck on \u2013 you challenge yourself, you challenge the status quo, and your life inevitably becomes more textured and intrigueing.\nSuch a change\u00a0often happens\u00a0because something about\u00a0the world\u00a0suddenly strikes you as Just Not OK To Ignore Anymore. In my case, it was the veal calf encounter. Not even a real live\u00a0calf either; a photo of one I came across in 1995 while flipping through my environmental science textbook when I was supposed to be studying the nitrogen cycle instead, was quite sufficient.\nThe calf\u00a0spent its short life\u00a0confined\u00a0to a\u00a0small wooden crate that severely restricted movement, so that its muscles wouldn't develop properly and thus spoil the tender toothsome texture of the veal cutlet it would become.\nLike some kind of animal rights virus, that image infected me, and triggered what has felt at times like a physiological progression: I gave up baby cows first (obviously), then pigs, then big cows and anything else vaguely related to that veal calf i.e. Class Mammalia in its entirety. And the longer I went without eating mammals, the less I wanted to.\nI bade farewell to Class Aves similarly a few years later, helped along by finding a thing that strongly resembled a section of intestine in a Kentucky Chicken Burger. I still eat fish sometimes, but with increasing visceral unease: overfishing aside, sushi has just started to seem so fleshy lately.\nNot that it's all motivated by emotion and gut reaction, of course. Apart from all the other cerebral reasons, it's plain illogical for me to eat something I'm too chicken to kill myself. This could be called the \u201chit-man\u201d school of dietary philosophy: the crime lord who orders the slaughter is just as guilty as the guy he pays to do his dirty work \u2013 maybe more so. (I'm delighted to find I have a most unlikely ally in this, fellow-columnist Chris McEvoy , who generally guns for the bunnies, and their huggers.)\nAll of which I believe makes me more interesting dietary-wise than someone who says: \u201cI eat meat because it's what people have always done. Also I just laaaik it, hey.\u201d\nMore than that: people looove it. A couple of weekends back I found myself in an odd context: clutching two trembling veggie burgers while I stood in the queue that runs past the ruddy bank of chops and wors at Mzoli's Meat and towards the roaring hellfires where your choice of flesh is expertly cooked.\nFor the unitiated, Mzoli's is a wildly successful converted butchery/shebeen in Gugulethu, Cape Town, popular with tourists and local suburbanites wanting to venture just so far but not much further into the township experience. It was at Mzoli's, masticating my tasty but greyish soya, that it really hit home: for everybody else there that afternoon, and for the majority of humankind and especially meat-struck cultures like South Africa's, when it comes to food, Meat is the Big Attraction, the Main Event.\nAnd this is where vegetarianism fails: it's interesting, but pale. We just don't have the ritual, the pomp and ceremony, the culinary show-stoppers that the meat-eating world has. My \u201cveggie patties\u201d (which sound about as exciting as \"lentil\" or \"sack cloth\") simply did not have sufficient presence beside the mounds of savoury meat glistening in the sun at Mzoli's. There aren't vegetarian equivalents of those hideous but nonetheless ritualistically intense oxes on the spit, the roast suckling pigs, the turkeys with all the trimmings, the braais, the barbies, the slaughtering of the fatted calves, the Main Meaty Event.\nMeat is the star turn in most cultures, with other foodstuffs relegated to bit players, or garnish. (Actually at Mzoli's even the garnish seems largely extraneous, unless you count beer as a garnish).\nSo what I'd like to hear from the vegetarians and serious semi's is how we can\u00a0improve on\u00a0this unsatisfactory state of affairs. How do we shake off the puritanical image that still clings to us and move our nut roasts centre stage? How do we infuse this undeniably worthy lifestyle choice with more of a sense of celebration, revelry, and, oh, I dunno, FUN? (Yes, I know we know we're having fun, but how do we get that across better?)\nAs for you omnivores: what is really stopping you from coming over to the nut roast side, or at least spending a bit more time here? (Anyone answering that it's because a nut roast tastes like **** will be swiftly censored.)\n- Olivia Rose-Innes, EnviroHealth Editor, October 2010\nNotes\n*The month ahead is packed with Veg Days that we should be celebrating more successfully:\nOctober: World Vegetarian Awareness Month\n1 October: World Vegetarian Day\n2 October: World Farm Animals Day and Gandhi's birthday\n4 October: Feast Day of St Francis of Assisi, patron saint of animals\n16 October: World Food Day (about world hunger and food security, not stuffing ourselves)\n1 November: World Vegan Day\n**A semi-vegetarian is someone who avoids meat by eating no mammals, or no birds, or just very rarely eating meat. A vegetarian is someone who eats no animal flesh at all. In other words, says the Vegetarian Society rather meanly, there is no such thing as a semi-vegetarian and you should really\u00a0find something else to call\u00a0yourself.\nRead more:\nBob 2010/10/01 Comment #1\nInteresting, but...\nI've considered your arguments (long before you typed them out) and I still choose to be an omnivore.

Workers routinely torture the animals in their control. I love bacon, but every time I even think of it, I remember the poor pig with the \"\u00a0dumb look on his face\"\u00a0. It wasn't a dumb look, it was a look that said \"\u00a0Why are you doing this to me?\"\ngyverr 2010/10/01 Comment #23\nmeater\nWhat you do not eat becomes waste. So please people eat as much as you can and stop being wasteful. Modern people \"\u00a0vegies\"\u00a0 we evolved because of meat.Soon you will start thinking like monkeys.\nAdi 2010/10/01 Comment #24\nLaw of labeling\nIf I have meat eating friends over for dinner and serve, say, a sweet potato gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce, no-one is any wiser that they have been 'vegetarian' for the night. But, if I invited them over for a vegetarian meal, they likely wouldn't pitch. Vegetarianism has been adopted by New Age so the idea of not eating meat comes as a packaged concept with a whole bunch of values that don't always stick. Why be a Vegetarian - label - if all you're really doing is having a carrot for lunch?\nJulian Frost 2010/10/01 Comment #25\nThis meat-eater's view\nYou ask why people eat meat. My take is twofold:\n1. It's a convenient way to get protein.\n2. It's tasty.\nIt was a mistake to mention Chris McEvoy. He is just an obnoxious jerk and has joined Jon Qwelane, Kathy Lette and Dale Brown as someone I will never read again.\nAnother factor: I can't digest tofu. I've had it twice, and both times I had an upset stomach the next day.\nI think the way forward is to promote meat-free days. I planned a vegetarian for pasta tonight.\nDavid 2010/10/01 Comment #26\nVegetables have rights!\nI personally think that vegetables also have rights and should be protected from the certain death that adding them to your diet would condemn them to.\nGive up meat, fruit and vegetables and respect the rights of all living organisms to live in peace and joy.\nPS: This is being written from my hospital bed as I have made the supreme sacrifice in order to live up to my convictions. See you on the other side...\nBaz 2010/10/01 Comment #27\nTiresome\nWhy do vegatarians/vegans always feel the need to preach the benefits of their life style and try and \"\u00a0win people over.\"\u00a0 Just like Jehovas Witnesses, Happy Clappers and people who only eat organic stuff. You're all tiresome.\nJake 2010/10/01 Comment #28\nGood point David\nPlease correct me if I am wrong, but was it Bob Dylan that said he could hear the carrots scream when he picked it from his garden?\nJ ON 2010/10/01 Comment #29\nseriously????\nLet me think.hmmm. Lamb shank or rice and lentils. My taste buds do the talking And they tell me after a mouth full of each that the lamb wins hooves down :D :D :D (couldn't resist) You enjoy your veggies and i'll enjoy meat with mine. have a tip top tasty weekend. By the way I hope you braaid some courgette and baby marrow last week on national braai day. Those things are awesome on a flame!!!\nRichard Band 2010/10/01 Comment #30\nNOT Holier than thou !\nThe only reason I can see for people to accuse you of being holier than thou is that the reasons you put forward cannot be refuted so it makes them hot under the collar. Please people just accept it that vegetarianism atloeast on a rational logical basis cannot be refuted. End.\nSugar 2010/10/01 Comment #31\nNo to Tofu\nTofu is just a bunch of nothing, it absorbs flavours poured over it, but in itself....ugh. Chicken, steak, etc. even if you don't sprinkle a single grain of salt on it, when cooked is still tastier than tofu. To me, it says we're supposed to eat meat and not tofu, otherwise, what's the taste buds supposed to do?\nPaul 2010/10/01 Comment #32\nFor the Author\nI was also surprised at the comments. Trying to have a balanced discussion in a semi-anonymous forum is not always a good idea. There is generally little respect for constructive argument and basic politeness.\nI thought that your article brought a new perspective on why there are so few vegetarians around.\nFor me personally I'll stick to my meat, I love the taste and am not really a vegetable fan and the protein alternatives to meat don't really inspire me. To each their own I suppose.\nLouis 2010/10/01 Comment #33\nVegetarianism is the future\nWhether people accept it or not - vegetarianism is the inherent natural existence of human beings. Meat causes cancer and clogs the arteries. Killing animals results in humans killing themselves in wars and abortions. I know alot of you will think this is hogwash I wonder if you think Newton's Laws of physics about cause and effect is also hogwash. We live in an interlinked system of time-space-action-reaction. A more vegetarian diet is actually the future of society. Meateating is a bad habit like smoking enjoyable but destructive.\nBerni Schaeffer 2010/10/01 Comment #34\nYou dont have to kill plants to be vegetarian\nWhen you pluck a fruit you do not kill the tree. When you pick a pumpkin you do not destroy the plant. When you pick a carrot it does not howl in pain - by design vegetables do not protest while you are kliing them - but try killing an animal - it will run away, cry in pain, bleet in misery. By design it tells you it does not want to die.\nPeter 2010/10/01 Comment #35\nI've tried..\nWell I eat fish and sometimes free range chicken. The reason I'm not vegetarian is that I just feel weak after a few accumulated days without animal protein. I was vegetarian before but due to my high activity level could not maintain it. Would crave unhealthy snacks (chocolates, cakes and coffee) to get me mentally and physically through the day. Popular convenient vegetarian products leave me with indigestion and I just don't feel good afterwards.\non the other hand 2010/10/01 Comment #36\nThe carrot tree\nAnd of course we know from Blackadder that '..the the carrot is the devils favourite food...' For it is written that ' Thou shall not eat from the tree that is known as..the carrot tree'\njj 2010/10/01 Comment #37\nstirer 2010/10/01 Comment #38\nMeat &\u00a0 vegetarians\nIf meat causes cancer, Louis, 95% of South Africa would be queuing up outside oncology centres! What garbage. And Adi, why is it that we sensible eaters have to specially cater for our vegetarian friends when they come round for dinner\u00a0 but they don't cook a meat dish for us when we are invited? what's good for the goose .... oops, I'd better not say that.\nMartin D Weiss 2010/10/01 Comment #39\nInteresting\nI have to comment.It's a wonderful article.Food directly affects our mood and behaviour. Meat and alcohol usually feed an overly aggressive mindset. Meat is \"\u00a0over nourishment\"\u00a0 for society which is mostly physically inactive due to modern times. Should we not rather adapt?The side effects of meating is well documented that is why doctors recommend a more vegetarian diet to stave off disease.The gladiators mostly ate bean for protein and healing wounds, meat was eaten only before and during fights\npauly 2010/10/01 Comment #40\nMY food sh1ts on your food!\nAllie 2010/10/01 Comment #41\nChicken\nI love telling people here in the US that in South Africa chicken is considered to be a vegetable, I tell them a typical meal consists of red meat and the veggies on the plate would be chicken\u2026\u00a0. :)\nThey actually believe me!!\nBob 2010/10/01 Comment #42\nAgain?\nDidn't we have this debate when that 'Aragorn' made a value judgment on meat eaters and blamed us for destroying the planet? Here's how it works - you make statements like 'my diet is healthier'' when you're not medically qualified, you're a quack. Make statements about ethics or religion without even wanting to understand the other or having studied in that direction, you're a hypocrite or a charlattan. You want to impose your life view on me - you're a fascist. 'Vegan' seems a nice composite\nShez 2010/10/01 Comment #43\nMain problem\nThe main problem is most of us converted to vegeterianism have come from families who only know one way to cook. I had an awesome dinner with indian friends of mine. They made the most delicious filling from green beans, carrot, onion and tomato. The spices they used just made it beauuuutiful. This is my main problem. I don't have enough family recipes hence why most of my food seems boring. I do have a lasagne dish that I converted, and my husband a meat eater LOVES it.\nShez 2010/10/01 Comment #44\n@Jake\n\"\u00a0Should all in South Africa become vegetarians we will require 38% more water to grow enough veggies to feed the whole damn lot.\"\nJake you're a moron. Sorry buddy, but it has been proven scientifically that the amount of water to get a piece of steak to your table accounts for a lot more water wasteage so I don't know where you made this load of croc up. Maybe you trying to give people an excuse with flawed info?\nDavid 2010/10/01 Comment #45\nOh dear!\nDon't you guys have a life? Stop reading and posting this crap and get on with your lives!\nOk, I'm off to the braai...\nPatrick 2010/10/01 Comment #46\nMeathead\nmy problem is i eat meat because i alway have, it is packed in nice little parcels which i tend to forget are even animals and i think thats the problem.\nwe don't see meat as a animal,just different parcels of meat.\nwe grow up believing that meat is of primary importance in early development to get the protein needed to aid in growth, the medical industry supports this.\ni believe that as we get older we should lay off the meat as it is not required anymore and get onto a more vegetarian type\nVegetarian 2010/10/01 Comment #47\nSomething you might not have known\nA fact that many people do not realise is how important the PH level of your body is. The ideal is slightly more alkaline than acid. Eating one steak will drop your ph from 7.2 (if it was that ideal in the first place) to around 3.5 which is very acidic. The only way your body can neutralise this acid is with calcium. And where does your body get that much calcium in a hurry, from your bones and your organs. So if u eat a lot of meat you are going to have to drink CalMag 3 times a day, Try it!!\nEx Meateater 2010/10/01 Comment #48\nMeateaters\nInteresting to note how aggressively the meat eaters attack the vegetarian \"\u00a0preachers\"\u00a0.\nThe choice to be a vegetarian has to do with consciousness. If you don't have it, you won't get it. Get it?\nJamie 2010/10/01 Comment #49\nSimple really - My food ***** on your food ...\nandrew 2010/10/01 Comment #50\nInteresting correlation.\n1st. There is a distinct correlation between a lack of meat in the diet and a lack of common sense. The question is. Which came first?\n2nd. The cat is generally a carnivour and carnivour generally atain diseases they why you pet them and not eat them. The pig will queal if you try to pet him. Thats why you eat him and not pet him.\n3rd. Louis. You have serious problem. You need a good steak to feed your brain.\nMark van Wyk 2010/10/01 Comment #51\nFreedom of Choice\nII love the taste of flesh. Animals are tasty. I stopped eating them, even though I love eating them so much. Why? Because like Hein (above) said, it's about freedom. I'm free, and I choose &\u00a0 respect freedom. It's only fair for me to respect the freedom of those under our/my care equally.\nWhat saddens me is that the author is writing on behalf of those [animals] less fortunate. I'm sure she'd love a juicy steak.\nThe folk arguing with her are only arguing for their own selfishness.\nShow care.\nanon 2010/10/01 Comment #52\nevolution\nwhy do we eat meat? easy: evolution. let me take you back when 2 species were competing in the race we call life, one just ate plants. and the other ate meat as well as plants. one guess who won in the end. jip the meat eaters. also the reason there are more men who eat meat than say women, goes back to the old hunter/gather days when the men used to hunt (meat) and the women used to grow plants (vegans)\nalso please, keep in mind being a vegan is a personal choice, so please, keep it to yourself\nMark van Wyk 2010/10/01 Comment #53\nMeat Eater vs Vegetarian\nWe all care. We care for our families, our children, our pets, our planet.\nThe animals of this world are really not treated right.\nIf we have a choice to inflict suffering on those amongst us or to love and care for those amongst us, why are we fighting?\nWe're both on the same side, some of us respect and care for our close family. Some of us care for our more remote (unseen) unfortunate animal families.\nCan't we rather support each other to care for the others we choose in all that we can?\nanon 2010/10/01 Comment #54\n\"\u00a0Animals kill other animals, it's nature\"\n\"\u00a0Animals kill other animals, it's nature\"\n\"\u00a0Eating meat is a instinct, not eating it is a choice\"\u00a0 - Dennis Leary\nI do feel bad for people who give there dogs rubbish like tofu, seriously, they are carnivores, if they were meant to eat plants they would have had flat teath\nTarryn 2010/10/01 Comment #55\nkill it yourself?\nSure people have been eating meat for millennia, but under what conditions? If we all kept a few cows in our gardens or had to go out and hunt for our suppers ourselves, I'd like to see how many people would still eat meat...It's easy to turn a blind eye to the suffering of animals when you walk into a shop or take away/restaurant and it's all neatly packaged ready for consumption..If consumers knew what went into that, if they had 2 watch it &\u00a0 bear witness, do you think things would b the same\nPaolo 2010/10/01 Comment #56\nThe truth about food\nWhat interests me about this whole debate is that nobody seems to actually consider our true nature. While I agree that it is possible to survive on vegetables, the tv show \"\u00a0The Truth About Food\"\u00a0 did a show on switching to a vegetarian diet. The show is completely scientific and showed that a healthy athlete became less healthy and less strong on a vegetarian diet. To me that settles it, we were meant to be omnivores, why should we feel any more guilty than a lion does?\nPeter 2010/10/01 Comment #57\nThe Truth about Vegetarians\nThrough-out the centuries most of the world's population have been involuntary vegetarians through poverty/circumstances. A modern, upmarket vegetarian is something completely unknown and incomprehensible to such people!\ndave 2010/10/01 Comment #58\nhypocrites\nAll live is created equal - veggies, fruit and plants feel pain as well which can be observed with radiofrequencies they send out when pruned etc. So why only kill the poor plants ! Who are we to decide between plant and animal as long as they are given a reasonable life &\u00a0mdash\u00a0- being in the medical field myself, the whole idea of vegetarian being so healthy is a complete fallacy. We are slowly starting to see the effects as this generation ages. Don't worry, the fashion will soon fade !\nMike 2010/10/01 Comment #59\nVegetable Head\nGee whiz - Vegetarian Comment #47. I don't know what you ate for lunch but your comment regarding the physiological effect of eating meat is the biggest bunch of horse.....radish I have ever heard. In fact, it is such utter non-sense its almost funny. Please, you are giving vegetarians a bad name\nandrew 2010/10/02 Comment #60\n@Tarryn\nActually when everyone had a few cows in there garden and people went out and killed there own meat, everyone ate meat. If people did not eat meat there would be no avaible resources to feed the animals. They would starve to death. I suppose you don't think that that is suffering. You need to eat a good steak to generate some common sense.\neleanor 2010/10/02 Comment #61\nmeat eating\nPeople are being conditioned into certain lifestyles and either change later on or do not change at all. It is the same in every sphere of their lives, be it religion, eating habits or whatever else. My husband does not appreciate any meal without meat. Meat equals food. Light salads, sandwiches or any other food in the absence of meat is scorned at as no food. Also, he will not eat yesterdays` food ie warmed up or camouflaged in any other form. After trying for 42 years I have given up!\nJoe the Farmer 2010/10/02 Comment #62\nVegetarians kill animals\nIf we all ate only vegetables and grain there would be no more animals. Just think of the farmers having to plow up all the natural grazing/habitat of animals just to produce wheat for bread. The bunny wunnys get squashed in their holes. The birdie wirdies get taken up in their nests in the wheat fields through the crushing combine harvesters. By eating a slice of bread you're killing - so get a life and do things in moderation\nRed 2010/10/02 Comment #63\nVegetarian\nIts my choice not to eat meat, people think I have something wrong with me, i don t drink either, they think I m nuts, I don t preach about it my family eat whatever they want. Don t get many dinner invitations to peoples homes they prefer t invite me to restuarants where I can eat whatever I want and they dont have to think about it - great!\nWTF 2010/10/02 Comment #64\nSupport plants' rights\nMeat IS the most concentrated source of energy available. There is more energy in a mass of protein than in the equivalent mass of carbs. People who live an active lifestyle can't be vegetarian because they just don't get enough energy from their food. Our bodies are designed to eat meat and it's only our couch potato lifestyle which has allowed us to forget that fact.\nVegetarian food is tasteless. The best vegetarian dishes pale into insignificance compared to a nice fat steak.\nSo help Me Eat Meat to compromise 2010/10/02 Comment #65\nI willing to give it a go on a braai\nMy family and I braai twice weekly... Every Week and would be very interested in an environment where we can maybe cut the meat or most of it in exchange for a vegetarian braai. However, your argument is solid. I need to find an \"\u00a0event\"\u00a0 dish that we will all enjoy without missing meat/chicken/fish.\nMhluzi 2010/10/02 Comment #66\nWhy can't we all just get along?\nI feel the author provided a fairly balanced article. My question is this\u00a0 we are all different and should be able to accept those differences.\nThere are definite pros and cons for all dietary choices - if we all accepted that fact and didn't try to change others viewpoints then the world in general would be a much happier place.\nI am a meat-eater but totally understand the advantages of a vegetarian lifestyle. I just choose to eat meat because at the end of the day I simply like it.\npeace+love!\nMhluzi 2010/10/02 Comment #67\nVegetarian recipes\nand another thing - for those who say that vegetarian food is tasteless should do themselves a favour and get hold of a good Hare Krishna recipe book.\nThe recipes are fantastic! Varied and tasty beyond your wildest dreams!.... Seriously... give it a try before you flame on...\nOlivia Rose-Innes 2010/10/02 Comment #68\nCooking Class\nAgreed that learning to cook reasonably well (I don't) is helpful for sticking with a low-meat diet / healthier, saner eating generally, and persuading others it's a good idea. If the food's delicious, people won't miss the meat. I think I'm going to spend some time with the recipe books this weekend....I rather like the idea of the Feast Day of St Francis (Monday, 4 October) - no mention of the 'V'\u00a0-word specifically, and 'Feast'\u00a0has an excellent, indulgent, celebratory ring to it.\nOlivia Rose-Innes 2010/10/02 Comment #69\nGet over yourselves, put-upon meateaters...\n..you're in the vast comfy majority. For each veggie who's done a 'preachy' number on you, they've had 10x as many meaties being rude or making silly animal noises. I must say, in my social circle these days there isn't really much animosity between the meat-heads and veg-heads. Meat-eating friends go out of their way to provide alternatives on their dinner-tables, and I'm very appreciative of that. Sure we discuss dietary choice, sometimes heatedly - why not?? It's fascinating and fundamental.\nMhluzi 2010/10/02 Comment #70\nDo the Hare Krishna thing, Olivia.\nOlivia Rose-Innes 2010/10/02 Comment #71\n@Mhluzi\nYes definitely - I've just remembered I know where to get my hands on a Hare Hare cook book!\nI'm not shaving my head though...\nGeorge W 2010/10/02 Comment #72\nsoybeans and religion\nMore fruits and veggies is a wise choice for better all-round health, but pushing hard for a meatless diet is not science, it's religion. We're omnivores, Cro-Magnons were omnivores, homo erectus was an omnivore, and I daresay australopithecines were as well. That's how we've evolved. Even chimps, our closest living primate relatives, eat some meat. Mistreatment of animals raised for food should be combated directly, not indirectly by pushing a vegan lifestyle.\nLordWabbit 2010/10/02 Comment #73\nHave you looked in a mirror lately?\nI think you could do with a bloody big steak. I have no qualms about killing something and eating it, something I have done on many an occasion. In another couple years they will probably discover that plants have feelings too, and then you'll have to live on water and the faeces from people who don't give a damn. Veggie food tastes like sh*t anyway, so you probably wont notice the difference.\nOlivia Rose-Innes 2010/10/02 Comment #74\n@George W and others\nWe must combat mistreatment of all species in every way, direct and indirect. The sci. jury is out on many health aspects of eating meat or not. Most certain is that too much is bad, and the Western world eats WAY too much, especially red meat. Protein is built from amino acids, and you get plenty in dairy and eggs. It's harder for vegans, but possible with a mix of amino-acid-rich legumes,grains,seeds. If you MUST eat meat, eat birds or fish. There's no health reason to eat mammals at all.\nOlivia Rose-Innes 2010/10/02 Comment #75\nctd....\nAs for the evolution argument: our prehistoric ancestors were indeed omnivores i.e. they ate mostly plant foods, some eggs and insects probably, and meat on very rare occasions. They also had a lot less choice than modern affluent humans, did not live in a context of planet-wide environmental crisis, and didn't know about the little amino acids yet. The great thing about being an omnivore, unlike an obligate carnivore: you dont HAVE to eat the meat.\nandrew 2010/10/02 Comment #76\n@Olivia Rose-Innes\nHow do you explain the hunting instinct. For the caveman its much easier to catch meat then to grow a crop. The bushman hunts regularly. When the whites first came across the Zulu the Zulu hunted. So I dispute your claim that our ancestors eat x no meat. I suggest you try a steak to add some brainpower to your thinking. Don't be a obligate herbivour. And do you know any obligate carnivour. I don't.\nGail 2010/10/02 Comment #77\nGeneral Comment\nI am a vegetarian &\u00a0 despite the popular belief here, have rarely unless provoked in the extreme given a meat eater a hard time. The same respect and consideration has often not been given to me and my diet has been the subject of much hilarity and innane comment. Judging by the animosity expressed here as well as the level of argument, eating meat does not do much at all for IQ whereas some very clever and enlightened people like Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison were vegetarian.\nGail 2010/10/02 Comment #78\nContinued\nPS - by the way nice article Olivia. Just to mention as well that people prize a dinner invitation to our house because the food is so interesting, tasty, varied and aesthetically pleasing. Drop by when you're in the Easten Cape.May you all enjoy vegetarian month.\nOlivia Rose-Innes 2010/10/02 Comment #79\n@andrew\nPrehistoric people didn't grow crops (you're right, it's hard work), they hunted and gathered. Mostly they gathered - most food was acquired this way. Bushmen living traditionallly in modern times are thought to reflect the prehistoric hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Scientists think we should emulate it to be healthy i.e. dont sit so much and eat fewer animal products.\nAn obligate carnivore is an animal that can only eat meat, like a lion\u00a0 obligate herbivores like buck can only eat plants.\nBob 2010/10/02 Comment #80\nHitler was a vegetarian too.

Why do we regard animals more special than plants? What gives us the right to make that choice? There are bull arguments that animals have a nervous system and plants not. Life is life.

Meat is an expensive, luxury item. I have no ethical issues with eating meat, but it makes up only a small proportion of our diet. Most days are meat free, with a little fish a couple of days a week.

If we did all convert to a veg/vegan diet we would need more land to grow the crops. This would destroy habitat currently occupied by animals.

They eat no animal products, so no meat, no eggs, no dairy.\nIf you eat any meat at all,, then strictly you are not a vegetarian.

Modern agribusiness has a huge negative impact environmentally, but some kinds of production are worse than others. Animal products (meat and dairy) generally use more resources and cause higher emissions than plant-based ones. Growing fruit &\u00a0 veg out of season, preserving and transporting them long distances also has a big impact.\nOlivia Rose-Innes 2010/10/03 Comment #132\n@Dimitri and others ctd...\nAs regards land use - livestock farming takes up vast tracts of land (about 30% of the total land surface), and remember a lot of cropland and crops produced are for feeding livestock.\nStef 2010/10/03 Comment #133\n@Dmitri\nIt doesn't take an Einstein to figure this one out, but even he said - the only way for humans to survive on planet earth would be to convert to a vegetarian diet.\nDo just a wee little bit of research before you make such ridiculous claims.\nBtw - The meat industry causes 40 % more greenhouse gasses than all the world's transport combined.

The meat industry, arguably the biggest industry on the planet, has major, wide-ranging environmental impacts through overgrazing, pesticide pollution, deforestation etc. Added to this the basic ecological principle of the energy pyramid, with (inefficient) energy loss at every level of conversion.

The ideal is slightly more alkaline than acid. Eating one steak will drop your ph from 7.2 (if it was that ideal in the first place) to around 3.5 which is very acidic. The only way your body can neutralise this acid is with calcium. And where does your body get that much calcium in a hurry, from your bones and your organs. So if u eat a lot of meat you are going to have to drink CalMag 3 times a day, Try it!!\nEx Meateater 2010/10/01 Comment #48\nMeateaters\nInteresting to note how aggressively the meat eaters attack the vegetarian \"\u00a0preachers\"\u00a0.\nThe choice to be a vegetarian has to do with consciousness.

We're omnivores, Cro-Magnons were omnivores, homo erectus was an omnivore, and I daresay australopithecines were as well. That's how we've evolved. Even chimps, our closest living primate relatives, eat some meat.

I have no qualms about killing something and eating it, something I have done on many an occasion.

Veggie food tastes like sh*t anyway, so you probably wont notice the difference.\nOlivia Rose-Innes 2010/10/02 Comment #74\n@George W and others\nWe must combat mistreatment of all species in every way, direct and indirect. The sci. jury is out on many health aspects of eating meat or not. Most certain is that too much is bad, and the Western world eats WAY too much, especially red meat. Protein is built from amino acids, and you get plenty in dairy and eggs. It's harder for vegans, but possible with a mix of amino-acid-rich legumes,grains,seeds. If you MUST eat meat, eat birds or fish. There's no health reason to eat mammals at all.\nOlivia Rose-Innes 2010/10/02 Comment #75\nctd....\nAs for the evolution argument: our prehistoric ancestors were indeed omnivores i.e. they ate mostly plant foods, some eggs and insects probably, and meat on very rare occasions. They also had a lot less choice than modern affluent humans, did not live in a context of planet-wide environmental crisis, and didn't know about the little amino acids yet. The great thing about being an omnivore, unlike an obligate carnivore: you dont HAVE to eat the meat.\nandrew 2010/10/02 Comment #76\n@Olivia Rose-Innes\nHow do you explain the hunting instinct. For the caveman its much easier to catch meat then to grow a crop. The bushman hunts regularly. When the whites first came across the Zulu the Zulu hunted. So I dispute your claim that our ancestors eat x no meat. I suggest you try a steak to add some brainpower to your thinking. Don't be a obligate herbivour. And do you know any obligate carnivour. I don't.\nGail 2010/10/02 Comment #77\nGeneral Comment\nI am a vegetarian &\u00a0 despite the popular belief here, have rarely unless provoked in the extreme given a meat eater a hard time. The same respect and consideration has often not been given to me and my diet has been the subject of much hilarity and innane comment. Judging by the animosity expressed here as well as the level of argument, eating meat does not do much at all for IQ whereas some very clever and enlightened people like Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison were vegetarian.\nGail 2010/10/02 Comment #78\nContinued\nPS - by the way nice article Olivia. Just to mention as well that people prize a dinner invitation to our house because the food is so interesting, tasty, varied and aesthetically pleasing.

Mostly they gathered - most food was acquired this way. Bushmen living traditionallly in modern times are thought to reflect the prehistoric hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Scientists think we should emulate it to be healthy i.e. dont sit so much and eat fewer animal products.\nAn obligate carnivore is an animal that can only eat meat, like a lion\u00a0 obligate herbivores like buck can only eat plants.\nBob 2010/10/02 Comment #80\nHitler was a vegetarian too.

Meat is an expensive, luxury item. I have no ethical issues with eating meat, but it makes up only a small proportion of our diet. Most days are meat free, with a little fish a couple of days a week.

They eat no animal products, so no meat, no eggs, no dairy.\nIf you eat any meat at all,, then strictly you are not a vegetarian.

Modern agribusiness has a huge negative impact environmentally, but some kinds of production are worse than others. Animal products (meat and dairy) generally use more resources and cause higher emissions than plant-based ones. Growing fruit &\u00a0 veg out of season, preserving and transporting them long distances also has a big impact.\nOlivia Rose-Innes 2010/10/03 Comment #132\n@Dimitri and others ctd...\nAs regards land use - livestock farming takes up vast tracts of land (about 30% of the total land surface), and remember a lot of cropland and crops produced are for feeding livestock.\nStef 2010/10/03 Comment #133\n@Dmitri\nIt doesn't take an Einstein to figure this one out, but even he said - the only way for humans to survive on planet earth would be to convert to a vegetarian diet.\nDo just a wee little bit of research before you make such ridiculous claims.\nBtw - The meat industry causes 40 % more greenhouse gasses than all the world's transport combined.

The meat industry, arguably the biggest industry on the planet, has major, wide-ranging environmental impacts through overgrazing, pesticide pollution, deforestation etc. Added to this the basic ecological principle of the energy pyramid, with (inefficient) energy loss at every level of conversion.

Example: If you live in a hot, tropical region, with plenty of food all year, planning for the future and intelligence is not a requirement for survival. However, if you stay somewhere where it gets really cold in winter, you'd better have the ability to plan and be intelligent enough to predict the coming winter, else your race will die out.\nPetra 2012/02/09 Comment #21\nEenvoudig\nElke nasie het maar sy eenvoudiges.

Still, I'm 10 minutes from qualifying for the Boston Marathon so now I'm weighing the pros and cons of training with a marathon training group this season. Do you have any suggestions? - Kim, Marathoning Mommy\nKim, I've always found it useful to make a list of pros and cons when making an important decision.\u00a0 It gives you the opportunity to weigh the issues thoughtfully and reach an informed decision.\u00a0 Let's start with list of cons, since I believe it will be a short one.\nCons to Group Marathon Training\nYou have to meet at a specific time, which may be a challenge.\nYou lose your \"alone time\" for some of your runs.\nThere will be a commute to the training sessions, which takes time.\nOverall, it will take more time to get in two of your weekly runs.\nA group can be intimidating at first.\u00a0 OK, maybe even scary...\nPros to Group Marathon Training\nMost group marathon training programs offer coaching, which will help you shave those 10 minutes off your time and improve your chances of qualifying for Boston.\nYou'll have the camaraderie and support of the group, which can pull you through the low-motivation days.\nIt's a great social outlet with healthy adults!\u00a0 Long runs, speed runs, and breakfast: What's better than that?\u00a0 You'll meet other fun, like-minded runners who share the same goals.\nRunning with a group of runners slightly faster than you is a great way to improve, especially during speed workouts.\u00a0 Training with a group will provide that extra push you need to improve your performance.\nYou'll learn along the way.\u00a0 Injury prevention, nutrition, and training tips are better learned from coaches and seasoned runners in the group.\u00a0 Many group programs have educational clinics to teach you everything you need to know to reach your Boston goal. You may even find someone who is willing to help pace you in the marathon!\nYou'll learn how to pace yourself on long, slow runs and fast speed runs.\u00a0 Pacers are a valuable component to group marathon training.\nMost group training programs meet once or twice per week, still leaving you with plenty of flexible solo runs as well.\u00a0 It could be the perfect balance for your busy life.\nAt the end of the day, it has to make logistical sense for you and your family.\u00a0 Make your list and sit down with your family.\u00a0 This will give you an opportunity to plan the season together and will allow them to support you in your journey to Boston.\u00a0 Keep in mind that the time you spend away from your family is an investment in you and in your family.\u00a0 You're a great role model and with every mile you're teaching them to live active, healthy lives and reach for their dreams.\nHappy Trails,\n"}, {"score": 407.09695, "uuid": "ff944b40-a3d5-59d2-966a-971203f40bb3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0811wb-41-07603", "target_hostname": "www.sciencebasedmedicine.org", "target_uri": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/igg-food-intolerance-tests-what-does-the-science-say/", "page_rank": 1.4204967e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Science-Based Medicine \u00bb IgG Food Intolerance Tests: <em>What</em> does <em>the</em> science", "snippet": "Will <em>the</em> use of <em>the</em> test make any <em>difference</em> in <em>the</em> outcome?

Otherwise, I\u2019m not sure what your point is. He mentioned lactose intolerance among the non-immune-mediated food intolerances, but to discuss the science behind it would be an entirely different subject, as is the subject of Celiac Disease. This was just about the bogus IgG testing that consumers are being offered to purchase on their own, which are becoming more mainstream as they are now being offered in pharmacies. Many consumers are falling into this trap, and thus making things difficult for themselves nutritionally. It is also falsely elevating the numbers of people who claim to have food allergies, and like I said before, muddying the waters for those whose allergies are legitimate.\nI\u2019m getting rather tired of others claiming milk allergy because it makes little Johnny hyper! Or a wheat allergy because it makes them fatigued. Just more excuses to sell useless supplements, all while confusing teachers and schools when every allergic child has different symptoms to look out for.\non 03 Feb 2012 at 1:29 am\n@JPZ,\nScott wrote:\n\u201cNot immune-system based, they\u2019re more common than allergies.

Why on earth would you think he should have mentioned the science behind lactose tolerance in an article about IgG testing? Logically, if he did that he would have to also cover the science behind gastrointestinal reflux (GERD), enzyme deficiencies, metabolic conditions, infections and other processes. That was not only unnecessary but would have made his article interminably long.\nYour comments are becoming tiresome and trollish.\nIf you have anything of substance to share, please do that instead of this kind of inappropriate nitpicking.\nmicheleinmichigan\non 03 Feb 2012 at 10:55 am\nOh well, I\u2019m afraid JPZ is beginning to look a bit silly in his attempt to gadfly.\nBut maybe I\u2019m going to look silly to. This line in the article has been bothering me. \u201c\u00a0 Children may be tested, too, and parents may be given a long list of foods they are told their child is intolerant of. I\u2019ve seen the effects in the community, too. Think going \u201cpeanut free\u201d is tough? A public school in my area sent home a list of forbidden food products: dairy, eggs, bananas, tree nuts, peanuts, soy, sesame, flax seed, kiwi, chicken, and bacon. Were these all true allergies? It\u2019s not disclosed. Anaphylactic or not, the parents had informed the school, and the school had banned the food product\u201d\nThe comment that the reason\u2019s for the \u201cbanning\u201d of the food isn\u2019t disclosed and the implication that we should assume that these bans are suspect if there are not related to an anaphylactic reaction bothers me. in my experience some school food bans merely cover foods taken into the class for parties, some cover food offered to children without direct permission from the parent, some are broad bans that include the whole school. This doesn\u2019t say which.\nAs a parent who has had to make very particular diet request for my child, post surgery, I rely on school personal and parents volunteering in class to take my child\u2019s requirements seriously, not question them because they are not related to a documented allergy, or they sound strange, or seem restrictive to someone who has no idea of the medical context And I don\u2019t think I should have to make my son\u2019s medical history public in order to be taken seriously.\nIt\u2019s great to cast doubt on CAM, but please focus on the CAM, not casting doubt on the parents or schools who are trying to provide a safe and comfortable environment for a student population that, due to our educational system\u2019s admirable commitment to mainstreaming, has an increasing number of diverse health and dietary needs.\nBogeymama\non 03 Feb 2012 at 11:49 am\nmicheleinmichigan I get your frustration. But I also get Scott\u2019s frustration. I follow the food allergy media very closely, and there have been many cases where parents fight back at those kids that are the cause of food bans. (Case in Florida last year got WAY out of hand \u2013 the parents felt their children\u2019s RIGHTS to have peanut butter at school trumped the safely of a Grade 1 student\u2019s right to a safe environment) It really creates a toxic environment, and is made worse when every parent demands a different set of rules. Most major food allergy advocacy groups do not support any type of food ban. Rather, they recommend broad anaphylaxis readiness training for all school staff, promote availability of Epipens (not locked away in the office) and rules about no sharing food, wiping desks, etc. Too much to go into here. The point is that all kids can be kept safe if a few simple rules are followed, and food bans don\u2019t have to happen at all. Nut bans are still implemented because they are easy to ban, and most food companies label appropriately wrt nuts. Sadly, anaphylaxis can also happen with milk (2nd most common cause of death from food allergy after nuts) and egg is increasingly common as well (and, technically, any food item that contains a protein \u2013 soy, wheat, seafood being the other common ones). Can you imagine trying to enforce a ban on milk? No products made with butter, cheese, yogurt, etc. No pizza! No grilled cheese! Some parents demand it, but I never have. Our allergist told us that even with a ban in place, do you honestly expect 200-300 sets of parents to be able to read and decipher labels for your child\u2019s allergens like you can? You have to always assume that the allergen could be present.\nI hear you about the privacy \u2013 if FAAN and Anaphylaxis Canada\u2019s recommendations were followed by schools and parents, food bans would not be necessary, and your child\u2019s medical information could easily be kept between you and the relevant school staff.\nThis is why I have such a problem with so-called allergies diagnosed by IgG. After I spend an hour with the staff teaching them about how to recognize symptoms of anaphylaxis, how to give Epi etc, these kids come in with allergies but have a completely different set of symptoms to watch for, and require no special treatment. It\u2019s very confusing for the teachers, and makes them question the seriousness of all kids\u2019 allergies.\nA little girl died a few weeks ago after she was given a peanut on the playground at school. No Epipen was given. These deaths do not have to happen. Everyone just needs to get on the same page!\n[url]http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/04/health/virginia-allergy-death/index.html?hpt=us_c2[url]\non 03 Feb 2012 at 12:26 pm\n@MIM\nMy statement wasn\u2019t meant to dismiss allergies. I treat allergies very seriously. True allergies can have a profound effect on all aspects on one\u2019s life. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical to know the difference between allergies and intolerances, so there\u2019s a better understanding of the respective risks, and their management. Evaluations, diagnoses, and management advice based on tests that lack clinical validity increases the challenge for facilities like schools to create safe environments for those with life-threatening allergies.\nmicheleinmichigan\non 03 Feb 2012 at 12:59 pm\n@Bogeymama, I totally get Scott\u2019s frustration with the IgG food testing. I only wish the statement I quoted didn\u2019t (unintentionally) seem to support the attitude that I\u2019ve felt I had to deal with. That attitude is that any odd sounding food request by a parent is met with suspicion, eye rolling and an assumption that the parent is overprotective or loony. I would rather people assume, unless there is evidence to the contrary, that the parent has a good reason for their concerns, rather than feel entitled to see medical documentation before agreeing that the parent is only making a reasonable effort in her child best interest.\nOf course when I say people, I mean parents in the community, I do understand that schools may need to see letters from doctors, etc to efficiently implement any food or safety plan.\nmicheleinmichigan\non 03 Feb 2012 at 1:43 pm\n@Scott Gavura, I did not take it that you dismissed allergies. I took it more that you were viewing a list of restricted foods with a critical eye as it somewhat narrowly applied to allergies. This critical eye may lead some to be dimissive of food restrictions that are needed by individual children but may not be related to severe allergies.\nOf course it\u2019s hard to imagine that a full school ban would be needed for non-allergy related food items, but in my experience many of these lists are not full school bans. They are a list of things not to bring for classroom parties, snacks or sharing with other children.\nmicheleinmichigan\non 03 Feb 2012 at 1:47 pm\nAlso Scott Guarva -\u201d Evaluations, diagnoses, and management advice based on tests that lack clinical validity increases the challenge for facilities like schools to create safe environments for those with life-threatening allergies.\u201d\nI completely agree with this statement, though. Schools should be able to manage these restrictions based on science and/or evidence, not funky market gimmick tests.\nCanLabs\non 03 Feb 2012 at 3:16 pm\nWe are CanLabs and represent the YorkTest FoodScan in Canada.\nWhile we agree that many food intolerance tests do lack scientific validation, we do believe that this is not a fair characterization of the YorkTest FoodScan. We believe that it is unfair to suggest that no patients will benefit from IgG testing due to the above mentioned criticisms. Other respected physicians and scientists share a different view then those found in the posting above.

The IgE testing in that article was shown to be the gold standard, so by offering something that is not the gold-standard for allergy/sensitivity testing, you are offering a substandard service, no?\nflorasubspecies\non 03 Feb 2012 at 4:11 pm\n@CanLabs,\nI\u2019m going to cry foul on your paper. No one is saying that individuals with IBS symptoms shouldn\u2019t be screened for legitimate intolerances like celiac disease. Gluten intolerance is well-defined in the literature and can present with IBS-like symptoms. However, this is specific, directed use of these tests in individuals with high clinical suspicion, and because IgGs are woefully non-specific, the typical antigen for assessing gluten intolerance is IgA. The paper itself claims that individuals can experience no symptoms at all, or continue to have symptoms months after consuming the antigen. In the first case, why are we treating someone with no clinical disease (since IBS is defined as having no clinical findings) and no symptoms? In the second case, if there is such a massive temporal dissociation between symptoms and the antigen, how is this biologically sustained and furthermore, how can you prove that the antigen caused the symptoms in the first place?\nBasic knowledge of epidemiology demonstrates that unless your test is nearly perfect and the prevalence of the disease is high, there is VERY little value to doing screening of asymptomatic patients and/or low risk populations. You\u2019re offering the test to individuals that you have no reason to suspect food intolerances in aside from vague symptoms like \u201cheadaches.\u201d An unproven test finding unproven correlates to unproven food intolerance is ridiculous at best and irresponsible at worst.\nCanLabs\non 03 Feb 2012 at 4:28 pm\n@Michael Kruse\nThere is more to the summary:\n\u201cIgG antibody testing for delayed food sensitivity remains controversial. However, data suggest that eliminating foods identified using IgG antibody food testing in IBS can result in significant symptom improvement.\u201d\nAs such, we feel that it would be unethical to prevent patient access to such a service that has been shown to \u201cresult in siginificant symptom improvement\u201d for patients with IBS.\nFor clairity, IgE is the gold standard for food allergy testing, not for delayed food intolerances.\nBogeymama\non 03 Feb 2012 at 5:13 pm\nMy favourite line in the linked-to paper:\n\u201cWhen test results indicate IgG sensitivities to a large number of foods, many alternative practitioners have anecdotally observed an associated increased intestinal permeability rather than frank food intolerances.\u201d\nHow exactly does an alternative practitioner observe increased intestinal permeability? Some kind of scanner?\non 03 Feb 2012 at 6:15 pm\n@CanLabs\nI believe your \u201cappeal to ethics\u201d is insincere:\n1. You linked to a highly criticized study for which Scott Gavura already provided an adequate rebuttal: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1774875/\n2. CanLabs apparently has the one study you promote as your \u201cvalidation\u201d of your tests, when in reality the study did not \u201cvalidate\u201d the tests.\n3. You ignore multiple reviews and newer studies that find absolutely no diagnostic quality for IgG food allergies:\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15864086\n4. You ignore essentially the collective knowledge of the world\u2019s allergy authorities finding that IgG food allergy tests are devoid of diagnostic ability. Instead, CanLabs/YorkTest would rather molest one sentence of a study into somehow being evidence for all of the claims on your website.\n5. You ignore the fact that, to an allergy doctor, the way food allergies are diagnosed is irrelevant. They would not care if its done by skin or by blood. In fact, skin allergy testing is tedious and time consuming. I\u2019m sure they would welcome with open arms a simple blood test if it had any diagnostic quality.\n6. No where on the front page of your website do you indicate that the food tests you provide are \u201cexperimental\u201d, \u201ccontroversial\u201d, or \u201cunproven.\u201d Instead you offer package deals which include the blood tests along with pamphlets on treating food intolerances, as if these kits are an effective way to diagnose and treat food allergies/intolerances.\n7. Your website is alarmist in nature. It insinuates that up to 45% of the population suffers from food allergies by making the claim:\nAccording to the leading medical charity Allergy UK, as many as 45%* of the population suffer from food intolerance which, whilst not life threatening can make all aspects of life very uncomfortable for sufferers.\nYour website then goes on to imply that we should all have food allergy tests performed in order to avoid suffering from generic symptoms. This 45% figure is an *estimate from a survey* from an allergy charity website (Allergy UK.) Therefore, essentially useless data is being used to worry people into taking these tests which have no proven diagnostic ability.\n8. You base other claims on your website from surveys (not research) performed by Allergy UK.\n9. There are financial ties between YorkTest and Allergy UK. YorkTest Laboratories is listed as a \u201ccorporate partner\u201d on the Allergy UK website.\n10. The Allergy UK website, which CanLabs apparently depends upon for its epidemiological data, states ( http://www.allergyuk.org/allergy_foodtest.aspx ):\nThere is controversy about the role of IgG; it may be present in the blood as a \u2018marker\u2019 for the foods we eat most often, rather than actually being involved in the food intolerance reaction. Nevertheless, some people find the test helps them decide which foods to avoid.\nNote that IgG tests are not tests for true food allergy.\n11. You list very generic symptoms (headache, or eczema, or acne, or joint pain, or fatigue, etc) and when any one of these individual symptoms is selected, your website explains the cause of the symptom as possibly due to food allergy. Example:\nDo you suffer from tiredness and fatigue?\nIf you find that you constantly feel tired, did you know that the food you are eating could be the root of the problem? According to leading charity Allergy UK up to 45% of the population suffers from food intolerances. YorkTest has a food intolerance programme that can help you to identify which foods you are reacting to.\nFor every single symptom listed, YorkTest identifies it as a possible food allergy and suggests allergy testing.\n12. YorkTest Laboratories apparently has a history of selectively quoting studies and implying that surveys or articles are published in places, such as BMJ, when they are really not: http://holfordwatch.info/2008/08/24/yorktest-hardman-hart-theres-a-difference-between-the-bmj-and-nutrition-and-food-science/\nFor these reasons, as I already stated, I believe your \u201cappeal to ethics\u201d is insincere. I believe you violate patient trust by presenting YorkTest IgG food allergy tests as if they are high diagnostic quality tests. I believe your company is acting unethically by offering these tests as part of a \u201cpackage\u201d to diagnose and treat unproven food intolerances. I believe your company selectively presents data or dubious quality to give the appearance these food tests have diagnostic quality when in fact they do not.\n-\nSpeculation: I am highly suspicious about the similarity between the YorkLabs and Allergy UK websites. The strange \u201chelp lines\u201d in the top-right corner and the same glossy buttons raise concern. Also, that YorkTest gives away a free membership to Allergy UK if a client buys a package deal from YorkLabs is concerning.\nQuill\non 03 Feb 2012 at 7:51 pm\nSkepticalHealth wrote: \u201cInstead, CanLabs/YorkTest would rather molest one sentence of a study into somehow being evidence for all of the claims on your website.\u201d\nI want to thank you for your thoughtful, well-cited post in general and in particular for the best use of the word \u201cmolest\u201d I\u2019ve seen in many years.\non 05 Feb 2012 at 6:04 am\nQuill, thank you kindly!\nAnthropologist Underground\non 05 Feb 2012 at 12:15 pm\nThanks for this.

The process has a lot of pitfalls, though \u2013 a lot of reasons why they can fail to diagnose an allergy that\u2019s there, or give people the wrong impression.\nThe virtue of elimination diets is that they don\u2019t make assumptions about the mechanism. They DO seem to be looking specifically for reactions mediated by the immune system, since the \u201chypoallergenic\u201d part means eliminating common food allergens.\nThe point of the elimination diet is not just to see if symptoms might go away, but also that the body does something to suppress the symptoms from the food allergies, and if you stop eating everything that you have an immune reaction to, then after the elimination diet, a reaction will become obvious. I experienced this over and over, very blatantly, so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a real phenomenon.\nBut, whatever the body is doing to suppress the symptoms, it\u2019s not specific to a particular allergen. So if you don\u2019t eliminate everything you\u2019re allergic to, you might not have an obvious reaction to a food challenge.\nThe idea behind IgG antibody testing is apparently that the symptoms of a lot of delayed food allergies are caused by IgG immune complexes, which circulate in the blood and cause symptoms in various parts of the body.\nI have a LOT of delayed food allergies, which I figured out using (several) elimination diets and food challenges. I start feeling bad about half an hour after eating a food I\u2019m allergic to, then within a few hours I\u2019m sick and I stay sick for 2-6 days. I described my food reactions in more detail in http://camoo.freeshell.org/reaction.html\nThe best guess about what\u2019s going on with those kinds of food reactions, seems to be that it\u2019s immune complexes, a kind of serum sickness from food. I looked up symptoms of serum sickness, and there are a lot of similarities to my food reactions. I\u2019ve seen reactions similar to mine described by many different people.\nI didn\u2019t trust IgG antibody testing to give accurate results, so I never got it, except for gluten \u2013 I did have high IgG antibodies to that.\nA hospital lab can test for IgG antibodies to food, at least the local hospital here does. Perhaps they are more accurate than places online like York Labs.\nHowever, I\u2019ve wondered if I should have gotten IgG testing. I\u2019ve spent many months total, maybe a year, sick from food challenges. Whatever is happening to my body during these sicknesses might be rather ugly and maybe cause permanent damage. Perhaps I could have avoided a lot of sickness by getting IgG antibody testing from a good lab.\nJust having negative results for IgE food antibodies with skin/blood tests does not BEGIN to imply that it\u2019s not an immune reaction.\nFirst, there might be reactions that aren\u2019t IgE-mediated. There are IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies in the gut, the IgE is under the gut lining.\nFor example, free light chains \u2013 a piece of an immunoglobulin wandering around by itself \u2013 can apparently cause degranulation of mast cells in mice, see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12068287\nLots of papers on free light chains in allergy, that I haven\u2019t looked at.\nPeople with rheumatoid arthritis have higher than normal levels of IgG and IgM in their intestinal fluid, though not necessarily in their blood, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16484508\nSome people with schizophrenia are gluten-sensitive \u2013 as determined from high IgG and IgA antibodies to gluten in their blood \u2013 but the immune reaction to gluten is different from the celiac immune reaction. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2856786/\nAnd so on, there\u2019s probably a great deal more.\nALSO, there seems to be a lot of evidence that people can have IgE-mediated allergies that are local, in various mucous membranes, like the nose, bronchial tubes, lungs, in the conjunctiva around the eyes, and in the gut. So people can have allergic reactions without having IgE antibodies to the allergen in their blood, it all happens locally. Mucous membranes have associated lymphoid tissue, and it seems that this can take the place of lymph nodes in the process of allergic sensitization.\nThere\u2019s good evidence that people can have inhalant allergies even though skin and blood tests for allergies are negative, see http://www.jiaci.org/issues/vol20issue5/cme.pdf\nThis concept of local allergy has been dubbed \u201centopy\u201d, and there\u2019s a good review article on that at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20642577\nThis article doesn\u2019t say much about local allergies in the gut except that local hypersensitivity does occur there. Another article mentions some evidence for local allergies in the gut, see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21679125 Also http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9275143\nFood reactions that don\u2019t appear in skin or blood tests for IgE allergy, have passed double-blind challenges.\nThe current tests that you can get for IgE food allergy are totally inadequate for diagnosing the actual range of immune reactions to food.\nI have reactions to very tiny amounts of food allergens. I\u2019ve gotten my 4-day sicknesses from things like a single vit. E capsule with soybean oil in it; from nibbling a trace of peanut butter that was under a fingernail, after I fed peanut butter to the squirrels; and so on. And these allergies have lasted for > 8 years of not eating the food, although my reactions are much less severe than they used to be.\nI find some of this person\u2019s niece\u2019s allergies dubious. Being allergic to sugar itself doesn\u2019t make sense. Beet sugar or cane sugar? Traces of beet protein or cane protein would be in the sugar, and you can react to that. But beet and cane are unrelated plants, so an allergy to beet sugar would be separate from an allergy to cane sugar. A reaction to sucrose itself is unlikely in small quantities. I don\u2019t know whether someone might be sensitive to a food dye.\nPeople commonly come to wrong conclusions about what is really bothering them in their food. People who\u2019ve been diagnosed or decided they have one allergy, seem to be reluctant to consider any other allergies. Like people who are gluten intolerant, and have problems after eating beef, decide that because the cow was grain-fed, they\u2019re getting gluten in the beef! This always sounded very unlikely to me.\nluarky\non 13 Feb 2012 at 7:33 pm\nAlso, there has been a lot of research on non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which affects about 10% of people. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3065425/\nIt\u2019s also an immune reaction to food, but according to this study (very detailed!) it mostly involves the innate immune system, with some involvement from the adaptive immune system. And no autoimmunity. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease, but non-celiac gluten-sensitivity is not.\nIn this study, about half the gluten-sensitive people had positive IgA and IgG antibodies to gluten. It doesn\u2019t say how many had just IgG antibodies to gluten, leaving open the question of whether IgG antibodies might be diagnostic for gluten sensitivity.\nAlso, I think allergists would generally agree that skin and blood tests for IgE food allergies are not very good, they often have false positives as well as false negatives. So even with the well-known kind of IgE food allergy, if someone tells a pharmacist they have to avoid something, they might be wrong, if they just go by allergy tests.\nPeople who are told they have a food allergy based on IgG antibodies, are likely to check it by eliminating then trying the food \u2013 so they are not necessarily just going by a lab test when they say they have a food allergy.\nCeliac disease was radically underdiagnosed in the United States in 2003, when a big epidemiological study found it at a rate of 1/133 \u2013 see http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/3/286 I read that at the time, it was being diagnosed in the US at a rate of 1/5000! If you had the \u201ctypical\u201d symptoms of losing weight, diarrhea, fat in the stools, you MIGHT get diagnosed. But what they found was that most celiacs don\u2019t fit that picture. The \u201ctypical\u201d celiac was actually atypical. I probably have celiac disease.\nFrom asking on a celiac mailing list, my kind of food reactions are quite typical for celiacs. It\u2019s similar to the usual celiac reaction to gluten. Celiacs often have delayed food allergies to foods without gluten. So some of the people who say they have food allergies that don\u2019t show up on skin or blood tests, actually have celiac disease.\nWeekend Update February 11, 2012 | | nutscinutsci\non 20 Feb 2012 at 12:09 pm\n[...] post by Scott Gavura:\u00a0Science-Based Medicine \u00bb IgG Food Intolerance Tests: What does the science say?

Several mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) have been associated with a number of conditions. Filaggrin is expressed in the tympanic membrane and could alter its mechanical properties, but the relationship between genetic variation in FLG and hearing has not yet been tested. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined whether loss-of function mutations R501X and 2282del4 in the FLG gene affected hearing in children. Twenty eight hearing variables representing five different aspects of hearing at age nine years in 5,377 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort were tested for association with these mutations. No evidence of association was found between R501X or 2282del4 (or overall FLG mutation carrier status) and any of the hearing phenotypes analysed.

We're always seeking the best and newest answers on these. How much should I drink in a race? How many carbs should I attempt to take in?\nThe new director of the Gatorade Sports Science Institute, Asker Jeukendrup, has been writing about these old chestnuts in several new journal papers. The information that follows comes from an article in the Journal of Sports Sciences, and summarizes expert opinion from a recent IOC Consensus group meeting on endurance sports nutrition.\nHow much should you drink in a marathon? Expert opinion now says it's commonplace and entirely okay to finish a marathon about two to three percent lighter than when you started. For the purposes of this blog, I'll use the middle ground--minus 2.5 percent--and assume that you are a 150-pound runner finishing the marathon in four hours.\nSince 2.5 percent of 150 pounds is 3.75 lbs (60 ounces), this represents fluid that you don't have to replace during a marathon. Divide by four hours, and it means that you don't have to drink 15 ounces/hour (that you might once have aimed to drink if you were planning to finish the marathon with zero weight loss.)\nYou can use a similar 2.5 percent approach for your own body weight, be it 100 pounds or 250. The resulting computation will give you an amount that you don't have to drink, because you're no longer aiming to maintain body weight. You still have to figure out how much to drink, which is primarily dependent on your weight, the weather, and your pace.\nFor the roughly 150-pounder, there's an easier way to get to \"the bottom line.\" The 2007 \"Exercise and Fluid Replacement\" Position Stand of the American College of Sports Medicine has a table for a 150-pound marathoner finishing in about four hours on a 64 degrees Fahrenheit day. If this runner drinks roughly 14 ounces of fluids an hour, he/she will likely finish about 2.3 percent dehydrated--that is, within the 2.5 percent guideline stated above.\nHere are some other runners and drinking amounts from the same table that will result in an acceptable 2 to 3 percent dehydration at the finish. Obvious messages: The more you weigh, the more you have to drink. The faster you run, the more you have to drink. Important corollary: If you are small and slow, you should not drink very much per hour, or you increase risk of hyponatremia . (Remember, these all refer to a 64 F day. Temperature and humidity are huge factors in both directions, high and low.)\nRunner weight\n"}, {"score": 384.70087, "uuid": "7c1ba418-e3d1-5b39-814e-3712ce8af580", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1218wb-43-26683", "target_hostname": "rwdaily.runnersworld.com", "target_uri": "http://rwdaily.runnersworld.com/2011/06/what-kind-of-bib-pinner-are-you.html", "page_rank": 1.1724384e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "<em>What</em> Kind of Bib-Pinner Are You? | RW Daily", "snippet": "Mark, you should go run <em>the</em> Maratona di Roma.

Goforth, an exercise physiologist and sometime winner of his age group in the Boston Marathon and BAA Half, said that he always drank a little Boston Harbor water before his Hopkinton-to-Boston efforts.\nAt least that's how I remember it. Of course, Goforth was pulling my leg. But he wasn't kidding about salty water. Goforth had conducted some unpublished research on the relationship between consuming salty water and the body's subsequent retention of that precious stuff. And he was convinced of this: more salt in your pre-exercise slurpy = less dehydration down the road.\nWhat Goforth actually did at the Boston Marathon was add a little additional salt to the Gatorade he carried to Hopkinton. Then he quaffed the Saltyade an hour before the start.\nIs it hot enough where you live? Same here. Hot enough to have me thinking about heat, hydration, and heading for the beach.\nThere's a key point that all runners must understand about the heat: It sucks, and there's little you can do about it. Nothing, and I mean nothing, will help you feel and perform well in the heat/humidity. Not more water, not some superade, and not a bag of ice in your running shorts.\nHere's all you need to know about summer running: Change your expectations. Run less, run slower, run at 4 a.m., run under shade. Do whatever works for you. And accept that it's going to feel crappy anyway. Humans are better at running in the heat than\u00a0 most other animals, but that doesn't mean we're good at it. We're just less bad. And it still sucks.\nThe good news? October is due to reappear in two months. And then you'll feel zippy again, and will be able to fun farther and faster than now.\nUntil then, you might try adding just a touch of salt to your last drink five minutes before you begin a workout. It has worked for Hal Goforth, and it's mentioned in this excellent Running Times story that includes interviews with two heat-hydration experts (Jonathan Dugas, and Eric Goulet). One of my favorite running-in-the-heat experts (Douglas Casa) agrees that there's a place for added salt.\n\"Research has shown that salt will provide some benefit with fluid retention,\" Casa says. \"But you have to be careful to find a middle ground. Add too much, and the taste is bad, and that might limit fluid ingestion.\"\nAs with so many other things, a lot more isn't better.

On 21 January Lisa Richwine published a report on \u201c EU Agency Urges Ban on Diet Drug \u201d in Reuters Health. The drug in question was sibutramine, the active ingredient in products such as Reductil, Ectiva, Ciplatrim and Meridia. Recently Simply Slim, an over-the-counter (OTC) herbal slimming pill, was found to contain high levels of sibutramine. The product was withdrawn from the South African market and\u00a0recently relaunched without sibutramine (Pretoria News, 2010).\nThe latest developments\nLast Monday it was announced in the press that Abbott Laboratories, who manufacture Reductil and Ectiva, were voluntarily withdrawing these sibutramine-containing slimming drugs from the South African market after consultation with the Medicines Control Council (MCC). According to the report, Abbott have also withdrawn these slimming pills in the USA, Australia, and Taiwan. The use of sibutramine for slimming purposes is banned in Europe.\nThe article in the Pretoria News (2010) also pointed out that the MCC has said that it intends taking \u201cappropriated action\u201d against generic versions of sibutramine-containing drugs such as Ciplatrim. A weight loss programme combining Ciplatrim and Weigh-Less was launched at the beginning of September 2009 and many of\u00a0Health24's users\u00a0reported that they were using it with varying degrees of success. In view of the MCC statement, Cipla may also be asked to withdraw Ciplatrim in the near future.\nReasons for the withdrawal\nThe Reuters report published in January 2010, said that a study called SCOUT, which compared Meridia (sibutramine) against placebo (dummy treatment) in 10 000 patients, had found an increased risk for heart attacks or stroke in subjects receiving the active drug.\nPreliminary data indicated that 11.4% of the subjects receiving sibutramine had died, or had a heart attack, a stroke or cardiac arrest compared to 10% for subjects who were given the placebo treatment (Richwine, 2010).\nIn reaction to these findings, the EU elected to ban all sibutramine-containing medications immediately. Other countries, including South Africa, first evaluated the results of the study to assess the risk posed to persons using sibutramine for slimming purposes. Abbott Laboratories who produce Reductil and Ectiva in South Africa have now voluntarily withdrawn these two slimming products in South Africa.\nWhat now?\nSibutramine was used for weight loss because it acts as an appetite suppressant and also stimulates metabolism. Many healthy individuals did benefit from using sibutramine to assist them with weight loss and did not develop any negative side-effects.\nNow slimmers in this country will have to lose weight without the aid of Reductil or Ectiva, and possibly also Ciplatrim. Needless to say,\u00a0Health24 users\u00a0are starting to panic and I receive frantic postings on the DietDoc Message Board from people who are totally stymied in their attempts to lose weight.\nOne by one even those slimming medications which were developed over many years under stringent scientific conditions and were subjected to extensive safety tests are now proving to be dangerous and possibly fatal to health.\nThis is indeed a problematic situation especially in a country like South Africa where the latest statistics show that up to 67% of adult women are obese, 61% of adults are overweight, obese, or morbidly obese and 17% of children under the age of 9 years are overweight (Joubert et al, 2007; Skade, 2010).\nWhile many people do lose weight successfully with the aid of appropriate slimming diets and regular exercise, some individuals need assistance to curb their appetites and give them support to achieve their weight loss goals.\nSome tips for desperate slimmers\na) What not to do\nThe first and most important fact to keep in mind is that you need to preserve your health and not expose yourself to the risk of developing heart attacks and strokes. In view of the worldwide concern about the safety of sibutramine-containing pharmaceutical products, I would advise\u00a0Health24 users\u00a0as follows:\nIf you are at present taking any slimming medication purchased in South Africa that contains sibutramine (i.e. Reductil, Ectiva or Ciplatrim), please contact the prescribing doctor or your pharmacist and discuss the risks associated with taking the remaining pills in your possession. If you experience any side-effects or have any doubts, stop taking these medications immediately. Rather safe, than sorry.\nDo NOT order any pharmaceutical products that contain sibutramine over the Internet (i.e. product such as Reduxane and Zelium from Europe, and Meridia from the USA or other parts of the world).\nBe aware of the fact that some OTC slimming products may be illegally laced with sibutramine. The Pretoria News article published last Monday warned that a product called Beauty Bitter Orange Slimming Capsules, which is reputedly \u201c100 percent herbal\u201d, was found to contain excessive amounts of sibutramine when tested by the FDA of America (Pretoria News, 2010).\nAvoid using OTC slimming pills, capsules, potions, liquids, and patches because they could contain undisclosed high levels of sibutramine, or be a waste of money or cause other undesirable side-effects like addiction, dehydration or loss of normal bowel function.\nNever give children or teenagers slimming pills of any kind as they may damage their metabolism and have serious side-effects.\nb) What you can do\nUse safer options for weight loss such as a balanced, energy-reduced low-fat, low-glycaemic index (GI) diet and regular exercise. It may take longer and you may need to exercise greater self-control, but this is one way of losing weight safely and sensibly.\nIf the 3 top Losers in the SA Biggest Loser show on etv in 2008, were able to lose between 45 and 62 kg in 12 weeks, you too can lose weight if you set your mind to it and stick to your diet and exercise regimen.\nAnyone struggling to lose weight, should consider consulting a registered dietician to help you with a tailored slimming diet that meets your special needs. You may have insulin resistance which requires the use of a low-fat, low-GI diet to promote effective weight loss. Having the support of a dietician to explain the details of such a diet and to give you encouragement as you lose weight may make the difference between success and failure.\nVisit the website of the Association for Dietetics in SA to find a dietician in your area. Consulting a dietician for a slimming diet is particularly valuable if you suffer from health problems such as heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, or metabolic syndrome. The dietician will take your medical conditions and any medications you may be taking for these conditions into account when working out a slimming diet for you.\nThe use of a low-GI diet should also prevent cravings that often cause attempts at slimming to fail. If you do not have constant cravings for sweets and carbohydrates because you are eating low-fat, high-fibre and low-GI carbohydrates as part of your slimming diet, you won\u2019t need all kinds of pills to see you through your weight loss journey.\nThe withdrawal of sibutramine-containing slimming pills is therefore not the end of the line for slimmers, because you do have other options which are safe and sensible.\n- (Dr IV van Heerden, DietDoc, October 2010)\nReference:\n(Joubert J et al (2007).

On 21 January Lisa Richwine published a report on \u201c EU Agency Urges Ban on Diet Drug \u201d in Reuters Health. The drug in question was sibutramine, the active ingredient in products such as Reductil, Ectiva, Ciplatrim and Meridia. Recently Simply Slim, an over-the-counter (OTC) herbal slimming pill, was found to contain high levels of sibutramine. The product was withdrawn from the South African market and\u00a0recently relaunched without sibutramine (Pretoria News, 2010).\nThe latest developments\nLast Monday it was announced in the press that Abbott Laboratories, who manufacture Reductil and Ectiva, were voluntarily withdrawing these sibutramine-containing slimming drugs from the South African market after consultation with the Medicines Control Council (MCC). According to the report, Abbott have also withdrawn these slimming pills in the USA, Australia, and Taiwan. The use of sibutramine for slimming purposes is banned in Europe.\nThe article in the Pretoria News (2010) also pointed out that the MCC has said that it intends taking \u201cappropriated action\u201d against generic versions of sibutramine-containing drugs such as Ciplatrim. A weight loss programme combining Ciplatrim and Weigh-Less was launched at the beginning of September 2009 and many of\u00a0Health24's users\u00a0reported that they were using it with varying degrees of success. In view of the MCC statement, Cipla may also be asked to withdraw Ciplatrim in the near future.\nReasons for the withdrawal\nThe Reuters report published in January 2010, said that a study called SCOUT, which compared Meridia (sibutramine) against placebo (dummy treatment) in 10 000 patients, had found an increased risk for heart attacks or stroke in subjects receiving the active drug.\nPreliminary data indicated that 11.4% of the subjects receiving sibutramine had died, or had a heart attack, a stroke or cardiac arrest compared to 10% for subjects who were given the placebo treatment (Richwine, 2010).\nIn reaction to these findings, the EU elected to ban all sibutramine-containing medications immediately. Other countries, including South Africa, first evaluated the results of the study to assess the risk posed to persons using sibutramine for slimming purposes. Abbott Laboratories who produce Reductil and Ectiva in South Africa have now voluntarily withdrawn these two slimming products in South Africa.\nWhat now?\nSibutramine was used for weight loss because it acts as an appetite suppressant and also stimulates metabolism. Many healthy individuals did benefit from using sibutramine to assist them with weight loss and did not develop any negative side-effects.\nNow slimmers in this country will have to lose weight without the aid of Reductil or Ectiva, and possibly also Ciplatrim. Needless to say,\u00a0Health24 users\u00a0are starting to panic and I receive frantic postings on the DietDoc Message Board from people who are totally stymied in their attempts to lose weight.\nOne by one even those slimming medications which were developed over many years under stringent scientific conditions and were subjected to extensive safety tests are now proving to be dangerous and possibly fatal to health.\nThis is indeed a problematic situation especially in a country like South Africa where the latest statistics show that up to 67% of adult women are obese, 61% of adults are overweight, obese, or morbidly obese and 17% of children under the age of 9 years are overweight (Joubert et al, 2007; Skade, 2010).\nWhile many people do lose weight successfully with the aid of appropriate slimming diets and regular exercise, some individuals need assistance to curb their appetites and give them support to achieve their weight loss goals.\nSome tips for desperate slimmers\na) What not to do\nThe first and most important fact to keep in mind is that you need to preserve your health and not expose yourself to the risk of developing heart attacks and strokes. In view of the worldwide concern about the safety of sibutramine-containing pharmaceutical products, I would advise\u00a0Health24 users\u00a0as follows:\nIf you are at present taking any slimming medication purchased in South Africa that contains sibutramine (i.e. Reductil, Ectiva or Ciplatrim), please contact the prescribing doctor or your pharmacist and discuss the risks associated with taking the remaining pills in your possession. If you experience any side-effects or have any doubts, stop taking these medications immediately. Rather safe, than sorry.\nDo NOT order any pharmaceutical products that contain sibutramine over the Internet (i.e. product such as Reduxane and Zelium from Europe, and Meridia from the USA or other parts of the world).\nBe aware of the fact that some OTC slimming products may be illegally laced with sibutramine. The Pretoria News article published last Monday warned that a product called Beauty Bitter Orange Slimming Capsules, which is reputedly \u201c100 percent herbal\u201d, was found to contain excessive amounts of sibutramine when tested by the FDA of America (Pretoria News, 2010).\nAvoid using OTC slimming pills, capsules, potions, liquids, and patches because they could contain undisclosed high levels of sibutramine, or be a waste of money or cause other undesirable side-effects like addiction, dehydration or loss of normal bowel function.\nNever give children or teenagers slimming pills of any kind as they may damage their metabolism and have serious side-effects.\nb) What you can do\nUse safer options for weight loss such as a balanced, energy-reduced low-fat, low-glycaemic index (GI) diet and regular exercise. It may take longer and you may need to exercise greater self-control, but this is one way of losing weight safely and sensibly.\nIf the 3 top Losers in the SA Biggest Loser show on etv in 2008, were able to lose between 45 and 62 kg in 12 weeks, you too can lose weight if you set your mind to it and stick to your diet and exercise regimen.\nAnyone struggling to lose weight, should consider consulting a registered dietician to help you with a tailored slimming diet that meets your special needs. You may have insulin resistance which requires the use of a low-fat, low-GI diet to promote effective weight loss. Having the support of a dietician to explain the details of such a diet and to give you encouragement as you lose weight may make the difference between success and failure.\nVisit the website of the Association for Dietetics in SA to find a dietician in your area. Consulting a dietician for a slimming diet is particularly valuable if you suffer from health problems such as heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, or metabolic syndrome. The dietician will take your medical conditions and any medications you may be taking for these conditions into account when working out a slimming diet for you.\nThe use of a low-GI diet should also prevent cravings that often cause attempts at slimming to fail. If you do not have constant cravings for sweets and carbohydrates because you are eating low-fat, high-fibre and low-GI carbohydrates as part of your slimming diet, you won\u2019t need all kinds of pills to see you through your weight loss journey.\nThe withdrawal of sibutramine-containing slimming pills is therefore not the end of the line for slimmers, because you do have other options which are safe and sensible.\n- (Dr IV van Heerden, DietDoc, October 2010)\nReference:\n(Joubert J et al (2007).

The current exploratory analysis assessed flare rates in patients who achieved initial low disease activity response (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group [BILAG] C or better in all organs) during the study. Exploratory reanalysis of data from the EXPLORER trial was conducted, considering alternative definitions for flare. No difference was found between rituximab and placebo in preventing or delaying moderate to severe flares. However, when severe (BILAG A) flares alone were examined, rituximab reduced the risk of a subsequent first A flare (hazard ratio = 0.61; p = 0.052) and lowered mean \u00b1 SD annualized A flare rates (0.86 \u00b1 1.47 vs. 1.41 \u00b1 2.14; p = 0.038). Eighty-four (49.7%) rituximab-treated patients achieved low disease activity without subsequent A flares versus 31 (35.2%) placebo-treated patients (p = 0.027). Prednisone rescue for A flares was similar in rituximab- (24%) and placebo-treated (14%) patients (p = 0.204).\nThis post hoc analysis evaluates the hypothesis that assessment of BILAG A flares may distinguish potential treatment effects with greater sensitivity than assessment of BILAG B flares.\n"}, {"score": 336.35114, "uuid": "e30c28d0-61f0-5655-90c5-24468c6bc9f0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0918wb-57-18856", "target_hostname": "admin.health24.com", "target_uri": "http://admin.health24.com/child/Fever/833-3438,17206.asp", "page_rank": 1.1711405e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "Here&#x27;s <em>what</em> to do: Health24: Parenting", "snippet": "But <em>is</em> it a cold sniffle or a flu sniffle?

Here's what to do\nLast updated: Monday, June 07, 2010 Print\nAs the nights get colder, it's not only the duvets and heaters that get hauled out, but boxes of tissues for the inevitable winter sniffles as well.\nBut is it a cold sniffle or a flu sniffle? And what can be done about it?\nTelling the difference\nThe perennial confusion between the common cold and influenza is due to the fact that the symptoms for both are so similar - runny nose, sore throat, fever and body aches.\nFor the record, colds are caused by viruses, and there are often at least 200 of them circulating during cold and flu season. But, there's typically only one influenza virus that circulates each year, health experts say.\nThe best ways to tell you're dealing with a cold, not the flu, are severity and duration - colds typically last from three to seven days and generally aren't very serious.\nTreating colds and flu\nDr Yeong Kwok, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan's Department of Internal Medicine, says the best treatment for the common cold comes right from your grandmother's book of sound advice: get plenty of rest, drink hot liquids, eat chicken soup, gargle with warm salt water and take over-the-counter cold remedies.\n\"Getting rest really does make sense, because we know that stress and a lot of physical activity can depress your immune system,\" he says. \"So if you do have an infection, it makes sense that resting and drinking lots of fluids would help your system get better, and prevent coming down with an additional problem.\"\nKwok adds that some studies have shown that taking zinc lozenges can reduce cold symptoms from six days to three days. While the evidence isn't strong, he says it can't hurt to have a stash of zinc lozenges handy, just to give a try.\nIf you feel like you've got a whopper of a cold, however, with more serious and longer lasting symptoms than normal, you're probably dealing with the flu.\nCases of flu can last up to about 12 days. And although antibiotics are useless against a cold, they can be effective in treating the flu virus, Kwok says. But they're only really effective if taken within 48 hours of the first symptoms and are usually prescribed for high-risk cases.\nThat leaves the countless over-the-counter drugs to combat colds and the flu, but even the most potent varieties are likely to offer little more than temporary relief, says Dr Larry Fields, a family physician.\n\"The over-the-counter medications act to control symptoms so you may feel better, but the course of illness is not shortened by the drugs,\" Fields says.\nIs flu serious?\nSo if the treatment is typically the same for the cold and flu, why is it important to know whether you've got one or the other?\nBecause the flu has much greater potential to lead to pneumonia in certain high-risk people, Kwok says. Those people include the elderly, those with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, asthma or chronic bronchitis, and those with auto-immune deficiencies.\nPneumonia should be suspected if flu symptoms suddenly worsen, if a fever suddenly spikes higher, or someone experiences shortness of breath.\nA health-care provider should be called immediately if such symptoms develop.\n\"It's very rare for someone to die from a cold, but the flu and complications from the flu are estimated to cause about 20 000 deaths per year in the United States. So that's why there's more concern about the flu,\" says Kwok.\nPrevention the best medicine\nThe best way to protect against the flu and pneumonia is to get a flu shot. Although anyone can get one, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the vaccine for people over 50, those in the high-risk groups, women who will be at least three months pregnant during flu season and those with compromised auto-immune systems.\n\"Anyone who is in a high-risk group, regardless of their age, should consider having the vaccine. And anyone who just doesn't want to get the flu should also think about the flu vaccine,\" says Kwok.\nTo further cut your risk of colds and flu, there's always good old hand washing, says Fields.\n\"Regularly washing your hands is highly important whether you have a cold or are trying to avoid getting one,\" he says. \"If you're the infected person, you also need to make sure to cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze so that you're not spreading it that way.\"\nadvertisement\n"}, {"score": 329.646, "uuid": "390c5a51-c46b-572e-88e3-586af3732b57", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-52-14443", "target_hostname": "renegadehealth.com", "target_uri": "http://renegadehealth.com/blog/2012/04/03/fasting%25e2%2580%2594what-why-when-who-and-where-by-guest-author-alan-goldhamer-d-c/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Fasting\u2014<em>What</em>, Why, When, Who, and Where : by Guest Author Alan Goldhamer", "snippet": "Fasting also has been proven to be effective in a variety of other situations, including helping <em>the</em> body to heal itself from high blood pressure, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, asthma, <em>eczema</em>, and <em>psoriasis</em>", "explanation": null, "document": "Kevin's new book clears the confusion about nutrition science and gently encourages you to create a lifestyle of sustainable health.

As the director of TrueNorth Health Center, the oldest and largest inpatient facility specializing in medically supervised fasting in the United States, I have seen how effective fasting can be in both building and restoring health.\nWhat Exactly is Fasting?\nTherapeutic fasting (also called \u201cwater-only fasting\u201d) is the complete abstinence from all substances except pure water in an environment of complete rest. It is important to emphasize that simply abstaining from food\u2014even for a few days\u2014while continuing to work, exercise, and worry about day-to-day cares is not therapeutic fasting. Likewise, eating only certain foods or drinking only juices is not therapeutic fasting. Juice diets and \u201celimination\u201d diets can be healthful, but they are not the same as therapeutic fasting. The physiological and clinical benefits are different.\nWhy Fast?\nThe clearest indication for fasting is the loss of appetite that characterizes acute disease. Fasting is extremely effective in helping to quickly resolve the problems that cause symptoms like fever, inflammation, and other temporary pains. It can be very helpful to stop eating until the crisis has resolved and hunger returns. That might mean skipping a meal or two, or it might mean skipping many meals.\nFasting also has been proven to be effective in a variety of other situations, including helping the body to heal itself from high blood pressure, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, asthma, eczema, and psoriasis. Fasting gives your body the opportunity to purify and heal its tissues and to eliminate undesirable tissue accumulations and growths.\nWhen to Fast?\nThe most important advice for anyone considering a fast is this: If you are going to fast, do it right, or don\u2019t do it at all. To maximize the benefits of therapeutic fasting, complete rest is essential. Complete rest is hard to get in a noisy, high stress, and/or nonsupportive environment, so finding a safe, supportive environment is necessary if you want to get the most from your body\u2019s self-healing mechanisms.\nWho Should Fast?\nThe decision to undertake a fast should be made in consultation with a knowledgeable physician, ideally one who is certified in fasting supervision. The procedure we follow at TrueNorth Health Center is to review the patient\u2019s medical history and perform a comprehensive physical examination, including appropriate laboratory and specialized diagnostic tests. The findings then are reviewed with the patient, and appropriate recommendations are made. These may include dietary and lifestyle changes, exercise programs, and, when indicated, fasting.\nYou don\u2019t have to be seriously ill to benefit from a supervised fast. A fast can be of great help if you need to make lifestyle changes to achieve improved health. Fasting for as few as five days often will dramatically shorten the time it takes to make the transition from a conventional diet and lifestyle (with all of the associated addictions, pains, fatigue, and disease) to the independent and energetic state associated with healthful living. People who undertake a fast in a supervised setting tend to achieve health more quickly than those who attempt changes without a fast.\nWhere to Fast\nOnce you have made a decision to fast, selecting a facility that will meet your requirements is paramount. TrueNorth Health Center provides an ideal environment. In addition, it provides knowledgeable medical, psychological, and other therapeutic care as needed and, when you start eating again, healthful meals designed especially for you by expert chefs.

No, she hasn't won the Nobel Prize or developed a vaccine. When Hall isn't seeing patients in the dental office, she's managing an emu farm. Hall explains her introduction to this 100 percent natural form of \"farmacology.\"\n\"Since 1979, when I graduated from the Community College of Baltimore, I had trouble with my skin. Washing 20-plus times a day led to sandpaper knuckles and cracked cuticles. I had chronic dry skin due to the repeated washing and gloving. Intact skin is the body's first defense against microbial invasion. When the skin barrier is cracked, the problem becomes more than cosmetic. It becomes a biosecurity issue. Be it herpetic whitlow, hepatitis, or staphylococcus aureus infection, once the skin is cracked, any microbe has an open door to the body.\"\nHer problems gave birth to research and discovery. Hall sought a solution to her occupational skin problem.\n\"My search began by reading dermatological texts, which referenced the need for hypoallergenic moisturizers to replace moisture lost by repeated washing. But I had already tried many dermatologist-endorsed lotions and creams,\" she said. \"Most of these seemed to leave a sticky residue as barrier to the skin. My skin temporarily felt and looked better, but the results were always short-lived.\"\nAlexandra enlisted the help of her husband, Dr. Michael Hall, in her search. \"My husband, Michael, took a more pragmatic approach. He examined the ingredients listed on lotion bottles to find out how each helped the skin. Here is where we got quite an awakening. All of the products had water, mineral oil, alcohol, and three or four chemicals - all ingredients that we would later find out serve the product, not the skin. Some of the ingredients have been documented to cause skin irritations, such as dermatitis and eczema,\" Hall said.\nIn 1991, Alexandra's problem became even more complicated. As the OSHA safety officer in her office, she came across a reference to petroleum skin care products on the OSHA website. It stated \"that significant deterioration of latex gloves was noted when exposed to petroleum-based lubricants ... if latex gloves are used, employees shall not apply petroleum-based - including mineral oil-based - skin care products. If appropriate, this in-formation must also be transmitted to employees as part of their required training.\"\nFinally, in 1995, an unexpected solution came from the most unlikely place - a farm show. The solution found there was emu oil.\n\"The farm show is where I first tried emu oil,\" Hall said, \"a product virtually unknown in this country, yet legendary in the outback of Australia where aborigines have been using it for centuries as a medicament to support healing of skin and to reduce inflammatory pain.\"\nAlexandra determined that emu oil not only helped her cracked, dry skin, but also her bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, caused by years of scaling and root planing (later compounded by computer keyboarding). She took vitamin B supplements and topically applied emu oil to both sides of her wrists three times a day to control pain with no drug-related side effects. Three-days' use brought her three weeks of relief.\nIt's a bird\nWhat makes emu oil different? Emu oil is a complex blend of fatty acids similar to human cell membranes. Our natural skin oil protects skin from the environment and the effects of aging. Researchers from Auburn University confirm that the major fatty acid in emu oil is oleic acid, a known transdermal penetrate and carrier. Most oils only lay on top of the skin. But emu oil has the ability to penetrate under the protective top layers of the skin. Without clogging pores like other oils, it delivers nutrients to newly forming skin cells.\nTwo years later, Alexandra and her husband bought a ranch to raise emus and sell the raw materials to other companies to manufacture and distribute. In 1999, the Halls created Outback Medic Survival Gear for Skin, the emu oil division of the Southern Cross Ranch.\nHall said the company was started \"to offer consistently high-quality emu oil products for consumers seeking effective, pure, and natural remedies.\" The company's Web site, www.outbackmedic.com, is an informative and retail source for emu oil that serves customers throughout the United States. Alexandra seems to have been destined for this endeavor. Her grandfather, as a child, was a goat herder in Greece. She has two children. Alex, a 19 year-old college sophomore, is the Webmaster of outbackmedic.com;15-year-old Stephanie is a \"keen critic, testing product formulas and marketing designs for the emu oil line. I may promote her to ranch photographer.\"\nShe added, \"The entire family helps with incubators, hatchers, and chick nursery chores when the chicks are hatched.\"\nCurrently, Alexandra divides her time between dental hygiene, the ranch, and a few other activities (serving as an American Emu Association liaison to the USDA, the board of directors for the Maryland Emu Association, and as a resource for health-care providers). The latter group includes pharmacists, dental and medical staff, naturopaths, massage therapists, diabetic and continent care coordinators, chiropractors, and veterinarians.\nShe also speaks at support groups for a variety of health issues.\nA day on the farm\nJust how much time out of her day does Hall spend with emu chores?\nShe explains, \"Believe it or not, emus are very hardy and easy to manage. Chores usually take approximately an hour a day. Morning chores consist of counting heads, checking each animal's overall demeanor and appearance, cleaning out waterers, and checking fence integrity. The birds are 'free fed,' which means they eat as much as they want and when they want. We feed the adults twice a week.\"\nNight chores are the same in laying season (December-April) when the grapefruit-sized, green oval eggs are collected, labeled, and stored for incubation. The incubators automatically rotate eggs and are equipped with alarms that sound when parameters of heat or humidity are compromised. Incubators are checked twice a day.\nOnce chicks are hatched, they are raised in a heated brooder building with daily outings (as weather permits) for sunshine's vitamin D until they are large enough (and the weather is warm enough) to remain outdoors. This usually occurs at about six to eight weeks of age when they reach two feet in height. The birds are raised to a weight of 90 to 100 pounds, which they reach at an age of about 14 months.\nThese birds live longer, happier, and healthier than your average poultry. An animal lover, ensured that the creatures she had raised in a happy and carefree environment would meet with a quick, painless, and humane end.\nNo antibiotics or growth hormones are given. There's no need for the drugs that kill intestinal parasites that repeatedly attack stressed and confined livestock. Hall's flocks have a very low mortality rate.\nAlexandra and Dr. Hall work together in his \"Dentistry in the Pines\" general practice three days a week. The office is located in Ocean Pines near Ocean City, Md.\nIn regard to being married to the \"boss,\" Hall said, \"Most people know we've been sweethearts since the summer after high school graduation, when Michael proposed marriage two months after we met,\" Alexandra said. \"We were engaged for three years, married, then went to dental school. That was 25 years ago! I guess we are one of the few dental school couples that stayed married against all odds.\nHow do Alexandra's patients respond to her raising emus?\n\"We have some patients who are interested in the animals themselves,\" Hall said. \"Kids love to hear stories about the ranch that raises five-foot-tall dinosaur birds that lay giant, green eggs. It helps to take their minds off their dental fears. Health-oriented adult patients seem to be interested in emu meat and oil information, uses, references, etc., as nutritional alternatives to medications. My youth- and beauty-oriented patients are interested in emu meat for another reason, especially the dieters and weight trainers. They also are interested in emu oil for skin thickening and wrinkle reduction, new-scar nutritional healing support, and stretch-mark reduction.\"\nConsumers should be aware, however, that not all forms of processed emu oil is edible.\nHall said she has seen clinical proof of the oils' efficacy in patients. She said, \"I've seen improved tissue tone/color, especially in my denture and chemo patients whose tissues were so dry. I've also seen good results with pure emu oil for fissured lips, the really hard-to-heal, 3mm-deep midline kind.\"\nWhen asked if she and her husband recommend emu oil to patients, Hall said, \"Emu oil is a food derived from refined and sterilized fat of the emu. We routinely recommend pure emu oil for patients with dry mouths due to radiation treatments, medications, aging, or chemotherapy. It acts as an oral lubricant and a nutrient moisturizer for chapped lips.\"\nShe added, \"Emu oil is listed in the Australian Therapeutic Goods Registry as both an active substance and active ingredient. In this country, the oil has not yet been evaluated by the FDA. Without the FDA evaluation, emu oil can be marketed for cosmetic uses only.\n\"I love the balance of providing dental services and uniquely healthful products,\" Hall said. \"The ranch is another extension of our caring for people. Everything we are involved in revolves around health - either keeping it or achieving it.\"\nJoanne Iannone Sheehan, RDH, is a frequent contributor to RDH and is based in Huntsville, Alabama. She can be contacted at gypsie1@peoplepc.com. References available upon request.\nEmus and the scientific community\nPhysicians and dermatologists are discovering the benefits of emu oil. Doctor Dan Dean, of Shepard, Mich., routinely recommends emu oil to his patients at risk of skin sores and ulcerations, (diabetics, convalescents, and patients with poor circulation). He notes that with a typical third-degree burn or skin abrasions, emu oil cuts healing time by almost half.\n\u0095 Dr. Esta Kronberg, who specializes in dermatologic surgery and cosmetic dermatology in Houston, uses emu oil on her worst cases - serious burns, rosacea, psoriasis, eczema, etc. She has been extremely pleased with the results. Dr. Kronberg admits she was at first skeptical about the benefits of emu oil. Also on the medical advisory board for the publication \"Derma,\" she has been quoted in magazines such as Good Housekeeping, Allure, and Glamour. Her treatments embrace acute skin care problems, including burns, skin disease, psoriasis, rosacea, eczema, as well as anti-aging and general skin improvement treatments. Her patients tell her the oil brings immediate relief, speeds healing, and keeps skin from scarring.\n\u0095 Dr. Thom Leahey of the Arthritis Clinic in Ardmore, Okla., has been studying emu oils' anti-inflammatory properties. A two-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of arthritis patients revealed that seven of the 12 emu oil users reported significant reduction of pain, morning stiffness, and swelling vs. one of the eight placebo users.\n\u0095 Dr. Elton J. Lormand, who has conducted research at the Advanced ENT and Facial Surgery Institute in Cullman, Ala., has seen the difference in patients using emu oil and in those who don't. After viewing the contrast in the skin condition between the two groups, he advised researchers to take a closer look at emu oil. He has seen patients apply emu oil prior to radiation treatment and even ingest it to cover the mucosal surfaces during head and neck radiation treatments. While the doctor gave them no specific instructions and would not recommend ingestion due to lack of research, he commented on the apparent lessening of radiation burns, even to the mucosal surfaces.\n\u0095 Scientists at Boston University Medical Center and Auburn University have concluded that emu oil's anti-inflammatory properties relieve pain in some forms of arthritis and lupus, as well as muscle and joint stiffness.\n\u0095 Dr. John Griswold, of the Harner Burn Center in Lubbock, Texas, believes that emu oil may revolutionize the treatment of burn victims because of the oil's ability to generate new skin cells so quickly. His long-term study also found a statistically significant difference in scar reduction and inflammation in emu oil-treated wounds.\n\u0095 Dr. William Code, in his initial research combining emu oil, spearmint oil, and lidocaine, found that the mixture produced a reduction in sensation to the skin, which surpassed another combination of local anesthetics without emu oil. The emu oil compound proved to reduce sensitivity in a safe, fast, and effective way for procedures such as suturing or giving injections.\n\u0095 Julie Brumlik is the co-owner of the patent on emu oil and Lidocaine, which she invented along with Dr. Dan Rivlin, head of dermatopathology at Miami's Mt. Sinai Hospital and a professor at the University of Miami Medical School. They invented and patented the product a couple of years ago, and it is in line for FDA approval as a compound. Chronic pain management specialists are excited about this research. Peer review papers have been published by the Society of American Oil Chemists. The effect of the compound lasts approximately 20 minutes. The patient maintains consciousness, but temporarily loses sensation where the mixture is applied. It is the only penetrating topical anesthesia that will work anywhere on the body, including gingival membranes. It also can be used on sunburn or sore muscles.\nNot shiny, but happy people\nThe Ratite Encyclopedia states, \"Traditional therapeutic qualities of emu oil are evident throughout Australia, although actual original discovery of the oil's qualities are locked in the oral history of the aboriginal people, extending back thousands of years. Oral history indicated that emu oil was used by the aborigines for the treatment of arthritic pain, inflamed joints, muscle aches, and burns.\"\nThe rock group, R.E.M., sang a song called Shiny, Happy People. The following stories are from very happy people, but, due to the ability of emu oil to absorb so readily into the skin, there is no shine involved. Here are just a few testimonials from people across the country who have found relief due to this Australian remedy:\n\u0095 In 1992, Deb Henson in Arizona had periodontal probings ranging from 5mm to 8mm and was a long-term smoker. She did not want periodontal surgery and couldn't get into the habit of flossing, even though her gums bled between dental visits. In 1994, Henson and her husband started an emu ranch. She discovered \"the remarkable healing properties of emu oil.\"\n\"That's when the light bulb went on,\" Deb said. \"It occurred to me that if emu oil could heal other parts of my body, why wouldn't it work on my mouth?\" On May 2, 1997, she surprised her dentist by presenting with not only \"firm\" gums, but no bleeding, inflammation, or deep pockets. Her oral mucosa looked healthy despite her smoking habit. Deb had been using a drop of emu oil on her toothpaste daily.\n\"There had been no other medicaments used but the oil for my pockets,\" Deb said. Deb still has perio readings within normal limits, even though, sadly, she still smokes and does not floss regularly.\n\u0095 Lucy-Jane Conley of Fenwick, Del., tried a variety of OTC products in drugstores to heal her son's cracked lip. The crack had developed into a crater that would bleed every time the child smiled or ate. She then applied one drop of emu oil three times a day, 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. In two days, Lucy noticed healing and, after the fifth day, the lip was completely healed and has not cracked since.\n\u0095 Dr. Thomas Samaras, a physician in Virginia Beach, Va., is impressed with the efficacy of pure emu oil for the treatment of arthritis and eczema. His own son suffered for two years from eczema behind his knees. Applying emu oil regularly to the area cleared up the condition within 10 days. Dr. Samaras has also seen significant improvement in a patient with degenerative arthritis and chronic torticollis (constant neck muscle spasms) by using emu oil on the neck. \"I expect that emu oil will continue to play an important role in my therapeutic armamentarium in the future,\" Dr. Samaras said.\n\u0095 Dr. Mary Bean, a dentist in Lutherville, Md., said, \"I've practiced dentistry since 1979 and developed CTS about six years ago from repetitive motion and the constant restriction of wearing gloves 40-plus hours a week. I had carpal tunnel surgery in 2000 on both hands and was back in my office for light duties the day after suture removal. I applied emu oil to the incision sites twice daily, and they are now minimally visible. Having a fantastic surgeon was very important, but I believe the emu oil hastened healing and minimized scarring. Now symptom-free, I use emu oil to keep my hands moisturized and my skin healthy.\"\n\u0095 Linda Barrett, a registered nurse, had a basal cell carcinoma removed from the perioral area between the base of her nose and her upper lip. \"My husband, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, performed the excisional biopsy. I had to keep the area covered for a week until the stitches were removed. Thereafter, I kept it moist with emu oil. My primary goal was to keep it moist for the duration of work, and I knew the emu oil would do that; however, the major secondary gain from the use of the emu oil was the rapid healing of the site. The continued use of the emu oil seems to have accelerated the resolution of scar tissue. Neither the line of incision or the suture area are visible.\"\nEmu oil is being studied by universities, research centers, and hospitals in the United States and abroad. It's hydrating, regenerative, lubricating, anti-inflammatory, and pain relieving properties make it the logical topic of study for an ever-broadening range of conditions.\nPatients who have tried emu oil on their own are educating their physicians about it's healing properties. People have also used it on eczema, psoriasis, seborrhea, hemorrhoids, thermal burns, sunburn, bikini-line and depilatory areas, and acne.\nRDH June, 2002\nAuthor(s) : Joanne Sheehan\nEmu's Zine does not diagnose, prescribe or dispense medical advice.\u00a0 We report and attempt to educate the public about the possible health benefits derived through the use of emu oil based products and consumption of low cholesterol, low fat emu meat.\u00a0\u00a0 This site contains personal testimonies and professional observations.\u00a0\u00a0 We encourage people to contact their family physicians regarding any health problems they may have for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n"}, {"score": 326.21567, "uuid": "93cd6181-c39e-5f5e-b4cc-5e7d724cd467", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0401tw-01-10428", "target_hostname": "sweatscience.runnersworld.com", "target_uri": "http://sweatscience.runnersworld.com/2012/02/barefoot-versus-running-shoes-which-is-surprisingly-more-efficient/?cm_mmc=Twitter-_-RunnersWorld-_-Content-Blog-_-SweatScienceBarefootShod", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Barefoot Versus Running Shoes: Which <em>Is</em> (Surprisingly) More Efficient?", "snippet": "MORE &quot;This book answers all <em>the</em> big questions.&quot; \u2013Amby Burfoot o Barefoot Versus Running Shoes: Which <em>Is</em> (Surprisingly) More Efficient? o <em>Is</em> there a <em>difference</em> between dehydration and thirst?", "explanation": null, "document": "I would not be surprise of the conclusion if it was written like that :\n1. Running in very light shoes takes less energy than running barefoot.\n2. The heavier your shoes are, the less efficiently you run.\n3. Running barefoot offers no metabolic advantage over running in very lightweight, medium cushioned shoes\u2026 for efficient runners.\nAlso I will add:\n4. It\u2019s clear that shoes need to be as light as possible.\n5. There is no evidence showing that characteristics of the modern shoes (high heel and other technologies) are good to improve performance.\n6. We don\u2019t know how minimal the protection can be, to have all the advantage on performance (cushioning versus weight)\u2026 and how this possible advantage is related to foot strike and to the adaptation to the foot tissues (use to run barefoot or not)\nI think it\u2019s another interesting study to compare with others published on that topic.\n* It\u2019s clear that the shoes have a huge masse effect on the O2 consumption: 0,7 to 1,0% O2 /100g . This was shown by 11 studies!!! (2011-Hanson, 2009-Squadrone 2008-Divert, 2009-Bonacci, 1985-Burkett, , 1994-Flaherty , 1979-Catlin, 1981-Roston, 1969-Soule, 1985-Martin, 1986-Jones)\n* Some proposed that the cushioning properties are increasing O2 consumption (by loss of energy) (2012-Perl, 2011-Hanson, 2008-Divert) OR decreasing O2 consumption (2012-Kram, 1984-frederick working in the Nike Lab) OR being subject dependent (2009-Bonacci, 2003-Nigg).\n* During over ground running, the traditional shoes increase the O2 consumption by up to 5,7% (for the same speed) with shoes compared to barefoot (2011-Hanson)\n* The mass effect seems to be more important that the cushioning effect to explain the increase in O2 consumption (2008-Divert)\n* Soft surfaces increase O2 consumption (Hardin 2004, Elliott 1994)\n* Anti pronator technologies don\u2019t increase O2 consumption (Rubin 2008)\n* After looking for confounding factors (mass and cadence) more minimalist shoes (Vibram FiveFingers) was more economical than traditional shoes (Asics Gel-Cumulus 10TM)\n* Stiffer sole in running shoes was increasing running economy (just by 1%) (Roy 2006)\nI thing that the next generation of performers will run in flatter shoes (less that 3 oz, very flexible, 0 drop and just enough cushion to let them running without protection behavior)\nmrsmiddy\nFebruary 29, 2012 at 3:52 am\nThis is interesting. I wonder is they considered changing m/s to determine efficiency too (up or down). Also, where the max speed differences are and their efficiency in comparison. It is clear I need to read more studies on running. I've been looking at calories burned over distance, and there are supporting studies that identify running burns more that walking, but only to a point, where the walking at higher speeds begins to burn more (there are knees in the curves [pun intended]) and at a point running becomes more efficient. I'd like to combine that minimalist/weighting approach in a similar study and see the outcome. I appreciate you sharing this, since I have been holding off making a choice to run with something less of a shoe than I do now, though the weight of my own shoe currently is about 4 times more than the least here. Things to think about for sure.\nLittleKi\nFebruary 29, 2012 at 6:11 am\nAs a minimilast runner, i can definitely empathize with the results of the study. To me, this doesn't come as a surprise. If you're running barefoot or in a minimalist shoe, you're categorically not going to get any boost from any cushioning. I've tried to find a lightly cushioned shoe for just this reason, but I haven't found anything that lets me maintain my form...\nI am hoping for a next-generation of shoes that narrows the gap between the minimalist and the more-minimalist shoes just a bit further.\nVTTrailRunner\nFebruary 29, 2012 at 7:35 am\nFascinating. Not really surprising to me, however. Several studies have shown that barefoot runners land with less impact. This requires some effort. Drop a book on the floor - it doesn't exactly land lightly. When your child falls out of bed, or a drunk falls on the sidewalk, they don't land lightly. Landing lightly requires some effort - coordination, timing, muscle use.\nI wonder then, if just a small amount of protection allows you to be slightly less careful. If you spend just a little less energy protecting your feet, your overall efficiency might be better. That benefit is then lost at 129 grams, when the weight becomes the more inefficient component. This is not to suggest that protecting your feet is bad, just perhaps slightly less efficient from a pure oxygen consumption standpoint.\nI think it's great that research like this is finally being done.\nTimingWiz\nFebruary 29, 2012 at 4:16 pm\nI'm skeptical. I can envision at least 2 side effects of wearing shoes that can increase efficiency - better traction (especially vs sweaty feet!) and energy return from the springiness of the shoe cushioning materials. The traction from the shoes could also be responsible for reducing the amount of wasted foot rotation while planted, contributing to a more economical gait.\nHow about repeating the experiment after the runners have worn the Mayflys for, say, 200 miles on the roads?\nOr, compare the Mayflys + weights to other shoes with different cushioning and add enough weight to make it similar.\nOr, try the experiment with a pair of shoes that claim to offer superior forefoot energy return, and saw off the heels to match the heel-toe drop of the Mayfly.\nIf it turns out that the springiness of the shoes contributes nearly all of the increased efficiency, then the question merely becomes \"Which shoe has the lightest weight and longest-lasting midsole springiness?\". Of course, that won't sell as many shoes.\nTheNF5K\nFebruary 29, 2012 at 5:31 pm\nIs this conclusive or just a good conversation starter? The study should have noted that all of the subjects got a good workout and therefore, left the basement of CU ex phys lab healthier. What, running does that regardless of footwear?

Recent investigations on the placebo effect as well as other mind-body interactions are helping us to understand some of the underlying mechanisms, as well as beginning to provide us with potentially effective adjuvant treatment strategies for a variety of human diseases.\nAlternative medicine represents practices neither incorporated into the mainstream of Western medicine nor validated by traditional scientific instruments, such as double-blind, controlled trials. Notwithstanding this vague definition, many of these medical approaches are widely used by mainstream practitioners in other parts of the world, as, for example, is the case of acupuncture or herbalist medicine in Southeast Asia; thus, the alternative label partly results from cultural variables. Some of the drugs that we prescribe in dermatology lack strong scientific proof of efficacy, and yet we do not consider ourselves alternative practitioners for using them; thus, the traditional or alternative labels may be a result of our particular training. Many alternative modalities are currently classified as \"mind-body interactions,\" and within this category we find the placebo effect.\nFor the last 30 years, the US Food and Drug Administration has required that to consider the beneficial effect of a drug, it has to be significantly more effective than a placebo. It is widely accepted that the specific effect of a drug or therapeutic modality is accompanied by nonspecific effects that may influence positively or negatively the outcome of the therapy. Studies that compare a drug with an inert substance are trying to determine how much of the effect is due to the drug itself, and how much is due to the natural history of the disease, expectancy, and psychological influences such as participating in a study, or believing that the subject is being administered a medicament. The effectiveness of a drug will derive from mathematical formulas that will depend on large differences between studied groups, or small changes in a large number of participating subjects. However, some health care providers and many patients are not overly concerned with the levels of statistical significance of outcome measures. In 1990, there were more visits to alternative medicine practitioners than to all primary care physicians combined, resulting in an expenditure of $13.7 billion, and most of these patients were concealing these visits from their regular physicians. 1 Similar trends have been reported elsewhere, such as in the case of Australia, where nearly 50% of the population consults alternative practices. 2 The use of a particular therapeutic modality by large numbers of individuals does not by itself validate it, but is suggestive of some perceived benefit. Since most alternative practices are based on principles that we currently do not fully understand, without the appropriate formal scientific studies we cannot differentiate their effects from placebo (understanding placebo as a therapeutic modality that does not have any specific effect in the treatment of a given disease). The effectiveness of placebos is difficult to evaluate. Since the initial studies in the 1950s, 3 suggesting that approximately 30% of the effect of therapies is due to placebo, numerous studies have examined this phenomenon. When we analyze the results, we are confronted by the observation that there is a marked variability in the reported effectiveness of the placebo arm. This is true of studies that measure the effects of the same drug, for the same disease, with a similar study population and similar protocols. Given all the conditions being equal, we have to assume that the differences seen in placebo response are due to the way they are administered. Critical to this is the manner in which the subjects' expectations are influenced by the transmittal of unconscious cues, reinforcing their belief or disbelief in the effectiveness of a particular medical intervention. In support of this is the notion that most patients participating in studies are anxious to identify if they are in the active or placebo arm of the study. Similarly, expectancy plays an important role in the outcome resulting from a placebo. Recently, Roberts et al 4 examined medical and surgical procedures that were widely used in the past, and were later abandoned following placebo controlled studies that showed their lack of effect. These authors carefully examined the data obtained from open studies at a time when they were considered highly effective by the patients as well as their physicians. They analyzed the use of glomectomies as treatment for asthma, levamisole as an immunomodulator, photodynamic therapy and organic solvents for herpes simplex infection, and gastric freezing for ulcers. Seventy percent of the almost 7000 patients who participated in these open studies in the 1960s and early 1970s were found to have obtained good to excellent results from these modalities. This report shows that belief and expectancy of patients, and especially of their health care providers, played a critical role in determining the effectiveness of treatments later found to be nonspecific by scientific measures.\nThe notion that the mind can affect overall health is not new. Although for many years the nervous system, immune system, and animal/human behavior have been the subject of individual study, new lines of research are now emerging that examine the interrelation between these seemingly disparate disciplines. During the last 2 decades it has become clear that numerous neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, and neurohormones not only exert effects within the neuro-endocrine systems but are also capable of augmenting or impairing the immune response by directly binding to specific receptors on the surface of immune cells. 5 - 6 Thus, not only are lymphoid organs innervated by noradrenergic postganglionic sympathetic fibers 7 but also the products released from peptidergic neurons have a distant effect on cells of all tissues. For example, mediators such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, somatostatin, corticotropin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neuropeptide Y, among others, have a profound effect on inflammation in the skin through their effect on local keratinocytes, mast cells, Langerhans cells, and blood vessels and local and distant lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. 8 - 9\n\"Most of our knowledge about how the brain links body memory and emotions has been gleaned through the study of classical conditioning.\" 10 In this process, for example, a rat perceives a noise that is paired to an electric footpad shock, and after a few such experiences (training), the rat responds automatically to the sound in the absence of shock. The noise is the conditioned stimulus, the foot shock the unconditioned stimulus, and the rat's reaction is a conditioned reaction, which consists of readily measured behavioral and physiological changes. 10 Early evidence of this mind-body connection stemmed from Pavlov's landmark classical conditioning studies in dogs, pairing the sound of a bell to the presence of food. 11 Contemporaneously, Metalnikov and Chorine 12 reported classical conditioning of the immune system in guinea pigs. The latter studies were mostly ignored until the 1970s, when Ader et al 13 and Cohen et al 14 showed classical conditioning of immunity using cyclophosphamide and saccharin as the unconditioned and conditioned stimuli, respectively. Cyclophosphamide was paired with saccharin, and the trained animals were later exposed to saccharin alone, which evoked identical immunosuppressive effects as those produced by the cyclophosphamide. Since then, numerous studies 15 - 17 have shown the effect of conditioning to suppress or enhance the immune response. Classical conditioning in humans is a well-recognized phenomenon, as exemplified by anticipatory nausea in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy 18 ; however, conditioning of immunity in humans has never been shown. This may be partially explained by the need of a strong and novel conditioned stimulus that is administered isolated from other environmental cues, and the difficulty in delivering this in humans because of the critical nature of our awareness.\nIN THE LAST 20 years numerous human studies have shown the influence of psychosocial factors on the immune system, 19 such as the presence of stress as a determinant in the development of the common cold following inoculation of the virus to healthy volunteers. 20 Even the evolution of neoplastic diseases has been found to be influenced by these factors. Spiegel et al 21 reported that women with metastatic breast cancer, who in addition to their standard treatment participated in a weekly session of group therapy and hypnosis, had a mean survival time that was double (36.6 months) that of a control group only receiving the standard oncological treatment (18.9 months). Fawzy et al 22 found a significant increase in survival of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma who participated in weekly psychiatric group sessions for 6 weeks, compared with those who did not. Hypnosis, as a psychological intervention, has been demonstrated to effectively modulate inflammation of the skin 23 - 28 and has been reported in uncontrolled or anecdotal studies to modify the clinical outcome of human disease, 29 including cutaneous disorders such as eczema, 30 urticaria, 31 warts, 32 - 33 and psoriasis. 34 We recently proposed the use of hypnosis as a tool to provide changes in the immune response in humans, in a manner similar to or replacing the effect of placebos, suggesting that hypnosis may allow us to bypass the natural human critical ability and simultaneously magnify the stimulus administered. 35 Hypnosis is a set of procedures during which suggestions are given for distortions of perception or memory; understanding suggestion as an idea offered to a person for uncritical acceptance. 36 In a recent randomized controlled pilot study 35 we showed the significant improvement (mean, 85%) in the psoriasis activity score index (PASI) 37 in highly hypnotizable patients with psoriasis subjected to weekly hypnosis. A sizable population of patients could benefit significantly from nonspecific treatments, not only because of their effectiveness but also because of the added benefit of limited adverse effects.\nWhen analyzing results of clinical drug studies, we many times observe that patients on the placebo arm of the study have a positive response. In studies that show figures with all of the subjects' data, we sometimes find that a number of the placebo responders have results similar to those of the active drug, whereas others show no improvement, or what is more common, further deterioration of the disease being treated. This supports the notion that in a number of diseases, some of the placebo responders do well with nonspecific treatments. Most results of drug studies are reported as overall means of the active vs placebo arms. In this fashion, the results obtained from the placebo group are averaged between those who responded well and those who (as expected) continued to deteriorate, and only when the responder group shows impressive results do the mean values show significant improvement. However, it is difficult to examine this further, since the data of individual subjects are not readily available from pharmaceutical companies and this information is denied by the Food and Drug Administration, based on the provision in the Freedom of Information Act that exempts trade secrets and confidential commercial information from public disclosure.\nMore difficult than identifying the effects is understanding the underlying nature of placebos (reviewed by Kirsch 38 ). Multiple explanations attempt to justify the effect of nonspecific treatments on patients. One obvious explanation lies within the natural evolution of diseases, and their waxing and waning independently of the therapeutic interventions. Many a practitioner becomes a patient's champion because he/she provided the last intervention before the symptoms improved spontaneously. Deception and self-deception or demand characteristics of the situation do not usually play a role in dermatologic studies, since the results are usually measured by a validated instrument and not self-reported. Participation in clinical trials may provide some degree of comfort, decrease in stress and anxiety, as well as patient education and contact with other patients with similar conditions, which may play a role in reduction of symptoms. The constructed belief that a result will occur, or expectancy, as well as classical conditioning play a role in defining a placebo response and are difficult to differentiate from one another in some situations.\nAlthough we do not fully understand the power of placebos, we should begin to harness their use. Recently, Nickel 39 reported that in a large trial of a drug to reduce benign prostate hypertrophy, subjects in the placebo arm of the study, as expected, suffered an increase in prostate size; surprisingly, however, they experienced marked improvement in the symptoms as well as in the objective measurements of urinary flow. Interestingly, these patients also experienced adverse effects, and 13% of the subjects had to discontinue the placebo because of the latter. This observation, which suggests that placebos may reduce the subjective as well as objective signs and symptoms, without tissue-specific anatomical modifications makes us rethink our therapeutic goals. Would it be useful to provide symptom relief through nonspecific therapies? Can we combine specific and nonspecific treatments to augment their efficacy? If so, it is important to identify modalities that provide such treatments in an ethical manner without deceiving the patients. Hypnosis has been proposed in the past as a nondeceptive technique for the provision of placebo in psychotherapy. 40 Our current interest is directed toward assessing and understanding the potential efficacy of hypnosis, classical conditioning, and a combination of both in the provision of nonspecific therapies to patients with dermatologic diseases. However, nonspecific effects are also exploited by some practitioners to deceive patients into believing in the putative-specific effect of certain treatment modalities. It is, therefore, crucial that when evaluating the effect of traditional as well as alternative therapies we apply strict scientific methods to measure their validity.\nAUTHOR INFORMATION\n"}, {"score": 316.27994, "uuid": "88832d99-7de6-5f82-8aff-0fa73afccba0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1610wb-57-26056", "target_hostname": "archderm.highwire.org", "target_uri": "http://archderm.highwire.org/cgi/content/full/134/11/1416", "page_rank": 1.1772182e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "Dermatol -- Different Modalities of Spa Therapy for Skin Diseases at <em>the</em>", "snippet": "Find out more about why this message <em>is</em> appearing and <em>what</em> you can do to make your experience on this site better.", "explanation": null, "document": "References\nVarious studies 4 , 14 - 15 , 36 - 48 have indicated that different DS spa therapy modalities are effective in the treatment of psoriasis. Most types of psoriasis, except generalized pustular psoriasis, responded to treatment. 10 Psoriatic erythroderma was successfully treated by heliotherapy in the DS area. 48 Until recently, most of these studies have consisted of clinical observations and descriptive rather than well-controlled studies. A review of the main clinical studies on DS spa therapy for psoriasis is presented later and in Table 1 .\nView this table:\n[in a new window]\nDead Sea (DS) Spa Therapy Modalities for Psoriasis*\nThe pioneering pilot studies of Dostrovsky et al 36 and Dostrovsky and Shanon 37 elucidated the therapeutic effect of helio-balnetherapy for psoriasis in the DS area. Avrach 38 and Montgomery 39 reported a beneficial effect in large groups of patients with psoriasis (577, 1052, and 1631, respectively) treated at the DS area.\nRetrospective studies 15 , 40 - 41 on 94, 110, and 1448 patients with psoriasis, respectively, treated at the DS area revealed a beneficial effect at the end of treatment in 81% to 88% of the patients, defined as complete clearing (95%-100% improvement), excellent improvement (80%-95% improvement), and marked improvement. The study groups consisted of selected patients with psoriasis, 15 patients with psoriasis enrolled in a dermatology clinic at the DS from March 1983 to June 1983, 40 and a cohort of consecutive patients with psoriasis treated at a DS psoriasis clinic. 41 Although most of the patients suffered from psoriasis vulgaris or plaque-type psoriasis, some heterogeneity with respect to the type of psoriasis was observed. 40 Furthermore, there were no uniform criteria for the extent of skin involvement prior to DS spa therapy (ie, >50 cm2involvement of skin area 15 ; an average of 29% skin involvement 40 ; and\n7% involvement in 76% of the patients 41 ). Heterogeneity with respect to the country of origin (Israeli and non-Israeli) 41 and the duration of treatment (4 weeks, 15 14-42 days [mean, 26 days], 40 and 28 days 41 ) was also observed. The treatment protocol 40 consisted of sun exposure (initial exposure of 10-20 minutes twice a day, depending on the skin type, with an increase in increments of 10 minutes each day until a maximum of approximately 6 hours a day) and bathing in the DS (initial bathing of 5 minutes, twice a day, with an increase in increments of 5 minutes every 3 days until a maximum of 30 minutes, twice a day). Topical adjuvant therapy consisted of emollients with or without nonsteroid ointments (containing salicylic acid, tar, and sulfur). In 1 of the series, 40 no significant improvement was observed in many patients until the third or fourth week. No significant associations were found with sex, previous DS spa treatments, prior hospitalization for psoriasis, prior psoralen\u0096UV-A therapy, or history of arthritis. 41 Determination of the individual UV sensitivity index (defined as the lowest exposure time to a UV radiation source, which produced erythema with defined border 24 hours later) by Azizi et al 15 revealed a more favorable result of the DS climatotherapy in patients with psoriasis with high UV sensitivity index (\n90 seconds) compared with low UV sensitivity index (30 seconds).\nA retrospective study by Giryes et al 42 disclosed a similar efficacy of climatotherapy compared with a combination of climatotherapy and balneotherapy performed for 3 weeks in patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Climatotherapy given to 38 patients without joint involvement consisted of sun exposure and bathing in the DS. A combination of climatotherapy and balneotherapy was used in 80 patients with joint involvement. The regimen of balneotherapy consisted of heated DS mud packs and thermal baths. The mean (\u00b1SD) percentage reduction of the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score did not differ significantly between the groups (88.5%\u00b111.6% and 91.5%\u00b110.5%, respectively).\nThe therapeutic role of DS spa therapy in patients with psoriatic arthritis was also shown in a prospective controlled study by Sukenik et al. 43 The study group was treated by a combination of sun exposure, bathing in the DS, mud packs, and sulfur baths, whereas patients treated traditionally only by sun exposure and bathing in the DS served as controls. The duration of treatment was 3 weeks. The mean (\u00b1SD) percentage reduction of the PASI score in the study group (n=130) did not differ significantly from that of the control group (n=18) (93.3%\u00b112.0% and 96.0%\u00b17.3%, respectively). A statistically significant improvement of the joint disease was observed in both groups (P<.001 and P=.02, respectively). However, reduction of spinal pain and increased range of lumbar spine movements were only observed in the study group. Despite the small number of patients in the control group and the fact that this study was not randomized, the age of the patients, the duration of psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis as well as the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and disease remitting drugs were similar in both groups.\nThe results of a retrospective analysis 44 implied that antipsoriatic pretreatment did not influence clearing of psoriasis vulgaris following DS climatotherapy (sun exposure and bathing in the DS). The study group consisted of 69 patients suffering from psoriasis vulgaris who were divided into 5 groups according to the antipsoriatic regimen used 4 weeks before DS climatotherapy (topical corticosteroids, calcipotriol, tar, salicylic acid ointment, or UV radiation). Fifty-four patients, who avoided using any medications 4 weeks prior to climatotherapy, served as a control group. Patients in all 5 pretreatment groups did not differ significantly with respect to sex, age, duration of disease, and climatotherapy. The PASI scores at the end of climatotherapy were significantly lower compared with PASI scores before climatotherapy in each study group (P<.001). However, no significant difference was observed in the PASI scores when the pretreatment groups were compared with the control group (P>.05).\nA recent prospective study conducted by Even-Paz et al 45 determined the best sun-exposure times for psoriasis treatment at the DS area. The study included 45 Israeli patients with psoriasis (volunteers from the Israel Psoriasis Association) treated at the DS area in July and August 1994 for 28 days. Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 sun-exposure schedules with a maximum daily sun exposure of 3.0, 4.5, or 6.0 hours, respectively. The therapy regimen consisted of sun exposure (twice daily, gradually increased from a few minutes daily to the maximum), bathing in the DS (twice daily for 20-30 minutes), and emollients (used freely). At the end of the therapy, the mean percentage reduction in the PASI score did not differ significantly among the 3 groups (90.2%, 85.5%, and 88.9%, respectively). The weekly cumulative improvement was similar for all groups. The degree of improvement did not differ significantly in patients whose initial PASI score was 20 or more. The results indicate that the daily sun exposure for treatment of psoriasis at the DS area in July and August need not exceed 3 hours.\nAnother prospective study conducted by Even-Paz et al 46 indicated that sun exposure was the main factor producing beneficial results for psoriasis (plaque type) in DS spa therapy, and that bathing in DS water enhanced the effect of solar radiation. The study included 81 patients with psoriasis (volunteers from the Israel Psoriasis Association) allocated to 1 of the following groups: DS water bathing only (15 patients); sun exposure only (34 patients); and sun exposure combined with DS water bathing (32 patients). The DS water bathing was performed for 20 minutes twice daily in heated indoor pools. Sun exposure was done twice daily in solaria, with a gradual increase in exposure from a few minutes to 5.5 hours daily. The duration of treatment was 4 weeks. Adjuvant treatment consisted of emollients (used freely). Previous antipsoriatic treatments were discontinued 3 weeks before arrival at the DS area. The mean percentage reduction in the PASI score (recorded by 1 physician alone, or by 2 working together) was 28.4% in patients who only bathed in the DS water, 72.8% in those only sunbathing, and 83.4% in those doing both. There was no significant seasonal difference in the results related to the sun-exposure groups.\nA recent prospective double-blind controlled study by Halevy et al 47 evaluated the sole therapeutic effect of DS salt in patients with psoriasis. The study included 25 patients with psoriasis vulgaris involving 15% or more of body area randomly allocated to 2 groups who were treated with either DS salt baths (13 patients) or common salt baths (12 patients). The treatment protocol consisted of once-daily salt baths that were heated to 35\u00b0C and of 20 minutes' duration, immediately followed by washing with tap water and lubrication of the skin (white soft paraffin, twice daily) for 3 weeks. Topical and systemic antipsoriatic therapy was withdrawn for 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, before starting the salt baths. In the DS bath salt and the common salt groups the mean PASI score at the end of treatment was significantly lower than the mean PASI score before treatment (P=.005 and P=.001, respectively). However, the mean percentage reduction in the PASI score at the end of treatment was higher in patients treated by DS bath salt compared with common salt (34.8% and 27.5%, respectively; P>.05). A similar trend was observed 1 month after termination of the treatment protocol (43.6% and 24%, respectively; P>.05). The results imply a beneficial therapeutic effect to bathing with either DS bath salt or common salt as monotherapy for psoriasis vulgaris, although an enhanced beneficial effect was observed in patients treated with DS bath salts. Statistical significance was not reached, probably due to the small number of patients in our study (P>.05 and P>.05, respectively).\nThe studies reviewed earlier display heterogeneity with respect to study group composition (demographic variables, disease type, and severity), spa therapy modality (protocol, timing, and duration), and criteria used for assessment of disease severity and therapeutic results. Most lack relevant data regarding joint disease, previous treatments, and length of remission achieved. Evaluation of the relative effectiveness of various treatment modalities has been carried out in only a few recent studies. These limitations preclude comparative analyses of DS spa therapy for psoriasis.\nSPA THERAPY FOR ATOPIC DERMATITIS AND OTHER SKIN DISEASES AT THE DS AREA\nJump to Section\n"}, {"score": 321.78888, "uuid": "7fd071b3-58ff-5f95-85c1-16f572b81f2e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1218wb-35-16347", "target_hostname": "rwdaily.runnersworld.com", "target_uri": "http://rwdaily.runnersworld.com/2011/01/ryan-halls-beard-is-a-wonder-to-behold.html", "page_rank": 1.172505e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "Ryan Hall\u2019s Beard <em>Is</em> a Wonder to Behold | RW Daily", "snippet": "birth control pill prednisone azathioprine hair loss prednisone prednisone treatment for neuropathy in dogs <em>is</em> prednisone used for headaches oral prednisone bulging disc in spine prednisone half-life <em>what</em> <em>is</em> prednisone used f cortisol <em>vs</em> prednisone effects of taking prednisone short term mitoxantrone", "explanation": null, "document": "Ryan Hall\u2019s Beard Is a Wonder to Behold\nJanuary 27, 2011 8:30 am\nMark Remy\nHave you seen Ryan Hall's Beard?\nThat capitalization is no accident.

She interviewed several good\u00a0experts, especially Willem van Mechelen from the Netherlands.\nSeveral years ago, when mired in a pile of injury-prevention papers, I found his among the best. Van Mechelen believes the following have little to no impact on running injuries: age, gender, weight, hills, hard/soft surfaces, stretching, pre-conditioning, and a number of other factors.\nKolata didn't mention Canadian biomechanist Benno Nigg, widely regarded as the father of the \"new paradigm\" that running surface and shoe cushioning don't have much effect. Nigg isn't always easy to understand, but I wrote about him and his ideas earlier this year.\nIt will be a long time, trust me, before your friends, training partners, and even your docs stop recommending stretching and grass and/or trails to limit your running injuries. But for now, there's no solid evidence that these tricks work.\nTo understand the hard/soft question, you only have to consider the case of the running robot who's trotting down an oceanside boardwalk and then decides to to finish his cool-down jog in the sand. He can't. He immediately collapses. This happens because he doesn't have a brain to adjust his muscle and joint stiffness for both a hard boardwalk and the soft sand.\nYou will manage to succeed where the robot fails, however, because you have a brain that automatically maintains the forces inside your legs at a constant tension. Let's call it 1.0. Your legs register 1.0 on cement, and 1.0 in sand. Result: You don't collapse; you can proudly call yourself a \"multi-surface runner,\" a much bigger engineering feat than you probably realize. (This is somewhat analogous to the cruise control on your car that maintains your speed at 60 mph whether you're headed uphill or down.)\nIf surface and cushioning make little difference, then the barefooters and minimalist runners are correct in claiming that thick, soft shoes don't actually provide the protection they claim. So take the shoes off!\nI'll buy a certain amount of this. I also detect an interesting commonality. Run in minimalist shoes, and you'll almost certainly reduce your stride length, because roads hurt, dammit. Run on grass or trails and you'll almost certainly reduce your stride length to maintain balance.\nSo I'm placing my money on short strides, not other panaceas. I think short strides, not grass or barefootin', could be the \"secret sauce\" of injury reduction.\nOf course, I've got no proof. That puts me in good company. I rank right up there at the top with all the other experts who have little evidence for their pet theories.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized .

The researchers presented both original photographs and mirror-reversed images, so that an original right-cheek image appeared to be a left-cheek image and vice versa.\nThey found a strong preference for left-sided portraits, regardless of whether the pictures were originally taken of the left side, or mirror-reversed. The left side of the face was rated as more aesthetically pleasing for both male and female posers.\nThese aesthetic preferences were also confirmed by measurements of pupil size, a reliable unconscious measurement of interest. Indeed, pupils dilate in response to more interesting stimuli \u2013 here more pleasant-looking faces, and constrict when looking at unpleasant images. In the experiment, pupil size increased with pleasantness ratings.\n(EurekAlert, April 2012)\n"}, {"score": 305.26688, "uuid": "c810c120-5269-512e-b8d0-047ccb64272c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0611wb-77-18576", "target_hostname": "www.skincell.org", "target_uri": "http://www.skincell.org/index.php/skin-conditions/ppp", "page_rank": 1.1804462e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "Skincell.org - Palmo-Plantar Pustulosis", "snippet": "In about 4 days <em>vs</em> about 28 <em>is</em> my understanding.

It initially presents as small pustules on the hands and/or feet, or just one hand/or foot. If not treated the pustules can form into a 'stream' as they join together. Burst pustules produce a greenish/yellow substance often thought to be bacterial (because of the colour). PPP happens when immature skin cells come to the surface before maturity. In about 4 days vs about 28 is my understanding.\nPPP is often confused by the sufferer as well as doctors, with Dyshidrotic Eczema aka Pompholyx. The difference is in the colour of the pustule/blisters contents. Pompholyx has clear blisters, PPP has yellow/green pustules. The colour of the pustules in PPP is clearly visible without them having burst.\nPustules need to be swabbed by a doctor or dermatologist; sent to a lab to be tested for both bacteria and fungus. The swab result will be negative for both bacteria and fungus. A swab is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment.\nCauses & Treatments of PPP\nInitial treatment is usually a steroid cream, and occlusion by wrapping the area with plastic wrap to increase by about 5 times the absorption of the product. Other topical treatments include tar as well as inhibitant Dovonex. Pustules burst, then crust over and peeling skin is the result. At this stage skin can often crack and form fissures. Heavy moisturizing cream goes hand-in-hand with a PPP diagnosis.\nIf the PPP is very stubborn and does not respond to topical treatments oral drugs are sometimes suggested. Oral drugs for this condition can have quite severe side effects, so discretion and knowledge is key. Sometimes oral antibiotics are prescribed. The dermatologist and patient should discuss all of these options.\nAs with many skin conditions each person is different and can present with different symptoms. Some people itch while others do not for example. What works for one person may not work for another. Please refer to your dermatologist for any advice as to what could work for you.\n"}], [{"score": 303.9209, "uuid": "46461277-1036-5c5f-8c33-6c2677c08e6d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0903wb-63-19005", "target_hostname": "www.optiderma.com", "target_uri": "http://www.optiderma.com/en/they-talk-about-it/interviews-skin-experts/which-antioxidants-should-you-include-in-your-diet.html", "page_rank": 1.2636383e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Which Antioxidants Should You Include In Your Diet?", "snippet": "According to <em>the</em> majority of people in <em>the</em> health industry, <em>psoriasis</em> <em>is</em> incurable.

For example, Acai berries created a big buzz in the food world for their rich antioxidant properties. We interviewed Sophia Medinski, Nutrition Expert and Clinical Dietitian, to get her point of view on the best antioxidants.\nA recent study reported at the 2009 Experimental Biology meeting in New Orleans shows that eating just one and a half servings of tart cherries could significantly boost antioxidant activity in the body. Cherry vs Acai berry: which one is the best antioxidant to include in our diet in your point of view?\nAntioxidants help tissue repair and fortify blood vessels in the body. Many fruits and vegetables have antioxidants. I would try both, cherries and acai berries and determine which one I like best. I prefer cherries as I like them.\nWhat do you think of resveratrol, the antioxidant found in the skin of red grapes?\nResveratrol is an antioxidant found in red wine. In many cultures, it is custom to consume 1 glass of red wine for dinner to maintain heart health. Now, researchers discovered resveratrol which prevents blood clots and helps lower cholesterol. All I can say is that our ancestors knew what they were doing before science could prove the benefits of certain practices.\nWhat is your own list of the 10 best antioxidants (if you've got a list)?\nI fancy the antioxidants below:\nAscorbic Acid (vitamin C)\nDioscorea extract\nAnthocyanidins\nHere is a good article: Torunn Stangeland, Siv F. Remberg and K\u00e5re A. Lye. Total antioxidant activity in 35 Ugandan fruits and vegetables . Available online 17 July 2008.\nAnother recent study shows that antioxidant-rich foods lose nutritional value over time and levels of good compounds drop after 6 months ( antioxidant-rich foods lose nutritional value over time ). Are there antioxidants that preserve better than others?\nI think Vitamin C and Beta Carotene are best antioxidants because they are water soluble and cannot accumulate in the body to toxic levels. They also preserve better in my opinion.\nDoes a diet rich in antioxidants really slow down the aging process? Is there any scientific proof?\nIn my opinion, the jury is still out on that one. I have not seen reliable research articles that support this claim. However, every year researchers make new discoveries. So, I keep an open mind.\nWe always hear that antioxidants are good for you. But foods like coffee, chocolate, or red wine are also known to trigger some skin conditions. Is it best to avoid some of them despite their high antioxidant content?\nToo much of anything is not good for anybody. Everything in moderation is the best! If one consumes these foods in moderation, one can benefit from antioxidants without triggering the skin conditions.\nHow can antioxidants be beneficial to people with a chronic skin condition?\nAntioxidants may reduce symptoms or help to maintain chronic skin conditions under control or prevent them from getting worse.\nDo you recommend to supplement your diet with antioxidants, such as vitamin E,C, Alpha Lipoic Acid, to name a few?\nSometimes I recommend supplements for my clients when I think clients may benefit from them. I usually recommend vitamin C and Beta Carotene.\nIs there any risk of taking too much from food and supplementation?\nYes.\nToxic effects of Beta carotene: yellowing of skin, diarrhea and arthralgias\nVitamin C (ascorbic acid): Diarrhea, gastric upset at intake > 2000 mg\nVitamin E:\u00a0 Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, possible antiplatelet effects, headache, fatigue and blurred vision at intake > 800 IU/d\nIs there anything you would like to add about the intake of antioxidants?\nConsume plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables for good health.\nAbout Sophia Medinski\nSophia Medinsky is a Registered Dietitian with the American Dietetic Association and a Certified Dietitian - Nutritionist in New York State.\nSophia has expertise in several areas, including weight management, oncology, general nutrition, heart disease, irritable bowel syndrome management, diabetes and hypertension.

From there, you\u2019d most likely tell your peers from work or school (29%), your \u201cfriends\u201d or followers on social networks (22%), your neighbors (19%), and finally your friends from childhood (16%).\u00a0 When it comes to your childhood friends and neighbors, the results reveal that you are much more selective about who you choose to tell.\u00a0 In these categories, the majority (52%) of you indicate that you have told either \u201ca few of them\u201d or \u201cnone of them.\u201d\nTwo conditions (HIV and Mood Conditions) are the least well known among all networks. \u00a0For instance, overall results suggest that within a patient\u2019s immediate family, 81% say \u201call of them\u201d know about the diagnosis. \u00a0However, in HIV, this figure is only 50%, and in Mood it\u2019s 56%. \u00a0The effect is even more pronounced with weaker social ties, such as neighbors; overall, 19% of respondents said that all of their neighbors knew their diagnosis; the same number was 4% in HIV and only 2% in Mood.\nWe didn\u2019t only analyze the results by condition.\u00a0 What about age?\u00a0 We found that older patients were more likely to have told their neighbors or people at work/ school than younger patients.\nPerhaps the richest data (still to be analyzed) is the open-text responses that we received about some of the positive and negative experiences you\u2019ve had as a result of sharing their diagnosis. A positive example from a patient with ALS read:\n\u201cI was devastated and overwhelmed initially, but after reading reports of other ALS patients on PatientsLikeMe, I realized I was not in this alone and their comments were so encouraging.\u00a0 They encouraged me to share with others and share the triumphs/and bad days.\u201d\nA patient with HIV shared some of the risks behind making the choice to be open:\n\u201cThere is still a massive stigma that goes with HIV. Disclosing can be incredibly difficult when it comes to who to tell and when. Too many still have major misconceptions about the disease and what it means for both the person that has the disease and the people around them.\u201d\nThank you to everyone who took a few minutes to take our poll.\u00a0 Tomorrow, we\u2019re going to look at what you said about how PatientsLikeMe has affected your openness.\n"}, {"score": 297.02786, "uuid": "6d876513-979a-5c76-a4ff-406a360eeace", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0306wb-76-28298", "target_hostname": "askcoachjenny.runnersworld.com", "target_uri": "http://askcoachjenny.runnersworld.com/2009/02/what-incline-should-i-use-on-my-treadmill.html", "page_rank": 1.2222254e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>What</em> Incline Should I Use on My Treadmill? | Ask Coach Jenny", "snippet": "I need to increase my &#x27;staying power&#x27; and <em>the</em> elevation for <em>the</em> course <em>is</em> upto 160 feet in some places...<em>what</em> incline should I use in <em>the</em> treadmill??", "explanation": null, "document": "What Incline Should I Use on My Treadmill?\nFebruary 3, 2009 4:10 pm\nTweet\nHi, Jenny.\u00a0 It's cold and I am hitting the treadmill. I plan to run the MORE Marathon in April and will be doing a lot of training on the treadmill due to the cold, snow, and my regular running route being hilly. What exactly is % incline? I see workouts all the time that say \"set @ 12% incline\" and my treadmill does not even go that high. Is this something different than setting it at 1.0 or 4.0?\u00a0 When I run on the tread I vary the incline from 1.0 to 5.0 for a minute at each, then ladder back down. Thanks for your answer to a dumb question. -\u00a0 Jill\nHi, Jill.\u00a0 First, there is no such thing as a dumb question.\u00a0 You can't learn without asking questions and we're all learning to together through the questions, answers and the comments posted.\u00a0 There are a lot of folks training on the treadmill this winter.\u00a0 It's a safe, convenient means to getting in your miles, especially during this brutal winter.\u00a0 But once the weather breaks, I would recommend a gradual transition to outdoor running.\nThe incline of a hill is measured as a percentage and so are treadmills.\u00a0 When you increase the level on the incline on the treadmill it is based on percentage not a level.\u00a0 So if you raise the treadmill to 2, it means you are running at a 2% incline (not a level two).\u00a0 Most treadmills can increase incline from 0.5 to 12%.\u00a0 Research has shown that when you set the treadmill at a 1-2% incline, it will simulate the \"intensity\" of outdoor running (make up for the lack of wind resistance in outdoor running).\u00a0 You'll often hear recommendations to run at a 2% incline if you run faster.\u00a0 While this is true, and it is important to train to specificity, I believe running at a constant 1-2% incline on the treadmill isn't the best way to go.\u00a0 One, it's a mental nightmare.\u00a0 Two, the hills on the half marathon course in Central Park\u00a0 will vary in length and incline.\u00a0 And C, it can really mess with your biomechanics if you aren't used to running at a constant incline.\nWhile the weather is cold, consider training on a hill program (course) on the treadmill and one that rolls up and down throughout the run.\u00a0 This will better simulate the rolling hills in Central Park, decrease the risk of an overuse injury running at the same incline, and provide a more mentally stimulating workout.\nAs soon as the weather breaks, begin to gradually transition your runs outdoors.\u00a0 Running on a treadmill is very different than running outdoors.\u00a0 Mostly due to the fact that you are keeping up with the tread rather than propelling yourself forward as you do while running outside.\u00a0 The terrain, surface and elements (cold, hot, wind...) are also more demanding.\u00a0 Plus, the more specific you can train to the course, the better you will race and recover.\u00a0 \u00a0Since the race is in Central Park, running outside on a similar course is optimal for your preparation.\u00a0 Take advantage of those hills in your neighborhood!\u00a0 They will only make you stronger!\u00a0 You can learn how to run hills with a smile on your face in this blog post .\nIf you are training 100% on the treadmill, take your time in making the transition to running outside.\u00a0 Transition one run outside every other week to allow your body the time it needs to adjust to the differences in running gait, impact and intensity.\u00a0 Start with moving your shorter runs outdoors and then progress to the longer runs.\u00a0 Aim for at least half of your training runs outdoors three weeks before the race.\nRemember, it is important to run by your effort level rather than your speed while making the transition to outdoor running.\u00a0 For instance, if you run a 10-minute mile on the treadmill, you may well be running a 10:30 outside at the same effort level (intensity).\u00a0 It is more effective to run by your effort level during the transition and will reduce the risk fatigue, injury, and frustration.\u00a0 You will also learn to pace yourself more effectively for race day.\u00a0 Patience is key.\u00a0 Your body will adjust in a matter of weeks.\nGood luck and keep those questions coming!\nHappy Trails,\n"}, {"score": 288.5662, "uuid": "9ce86ca7-53a6-5ac7-bd78-9f66c587485a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1513wb-56-24885", "target_hostname": "blog.garymoller.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.garymoller.com/2008/02/just-how-effective-is-glucosamine-and.html", "page_rank": 1.1791743e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": ": Just how effective <em>is</em> glucosamine and", "snippet": "I came accross Glucosamine, and heard <em>what</em> it does. i became very interested.

I'm not exactly sure how to say it, as i'm no expert yet, and i don't remember word for word, but the Doc basically said the results look like the results that may typically come in from a 50yrd, and i'm 27. Arthritis, bones rubbing in the joint, bone expanding due to rubbing... etc. He assured me not to take this out of proportion, and that we'll have a much better picture of what's going on once we have the MRI done, which is coming soon. For starters, i couldn't believe the results! at first, a little shocked and sad, but i'm definately not one to let a negative thing remain negative. I want to turn this around, and make a positive here, and be proactive in REPAIRING and hopefuly, fixing this problem. I came accross Glucosamine, and heard what it does. i became very interested. Essentially, the heart of every arthritis matter is cartiliage wear i guess. So, if this promotes the repair of cartiliage, then this is very intersting..\nSorry for drawing this out, but basically, what i wanted to know from you is how effective this stuff is in rebuilding and repairing joint problems? If i keep on this stuff, and i've already noticed a difference (i'm taking this nutri-flex fluid formula that contains the MSM and glucos) can i repair and/or prevent further damage?\n_____________________________________-\nGary Moller comments:\nI have now had about 15 years experience with people using these glucosamine and chondroitin products and I have no doubt whatsoever that they work - in most cases; but not all. This view is more or less supported by the growing body of research on these natural nutrition products.\nIt just makes sense that a nutritional approach to managing arthritis would work best if utilised early in the development and while the person is young. While this may be the case there is evidence that these can also be beneficial for old joints and are even effective for pain relief in advanced joint wear.\nI am curious as to why you have running and so much wear at such a young age? If there is joint damage such as a lax or ruptured knee ligament, then this should be repaired by a specialist knee surgeon now - while you are young. Do not leave it too late. Sort out the underlying causes of the wear and get it fixed asap.\nIn your case, the best joint food preparation is probably Balance Joint Food for Athletes . This is formulated for young joints that have been injured. Take the maximum recommended dose for at least three months and continue indefinitely at lower doses and certainly for as long as there is any sign of joint pain, tenderness or swelling. You must do all you can to care for your joints. Your knees have many, many years of hard work ahead of them.\n"}, {"score": 286.98975, "uuid": "7ce4e6e5-8971-57b3-82e5-94ee58ecf346", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1516wb-35-16517", "target_hostname": "blog.garymoller.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.garymoller.com/2008/02/achilles-tendon-rupture-getting-help-is.html", "page_rank": 1.1726364e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": ": Achilles tendon rupture - getting help <em>is</em>", "snippet": "I wish I knew <em>what</em> I know now back on <em>the</em> 10 November 2007 - Annette Annette&#x27;s story <em>is</em> not unusual; in fact it could be argued that this <em>is</em> usual of <em>the</em> standard of care by our hospital system and ACC (Accident Compensation Corporation). <em>What</em> <em>is</em> that standard: Appalling!", "explanation": null, "document": "Gary Moller: [DipPhEd PGDipRehab PGDipSportMed(Otago)FCE Certified, Kordel's and Nutra-Life Certified Natural Health Consultant].

(It happened as my left foot pushed off the ground in a bounce carrying all my weight ie high powered step up).\nI was taken to A&E & there filled out an ACC form stating \u2018ankle trauma\u2019 \u2013 not really knowing at that stage what I had really done. After a wait I went to the fracture clinic where I was seen by a doctor who ordered my leg to be plastered up to the knee with no weight bearing for 8 weeks.\nThe doctor filled his part of the ACC form in stating that I had ruptured my Achilles & off I went thinking I would receive help from ACC. After 5 weeks of ringing ACC requesting help, each time getting told they needed more information from the Hospital, which I organised to be faxed to\nthe Dunedin Office, I got a letter stating they would not cover me for this injury stating it was not an accident!\nI feel this is the critical time when further injury can be done as I was unable to have help after paying large amounts of ACC fees all my life they were not coming to give me any support \u2013 compounding the original injury \u2013 and in the end costing me & ACC a lot more \u2013however I continue\u2026. I then went to my own GP \u2013 who promptly wrote another ACC form outlining the incident which was again sent to ACC.\nIn these 5 weeks, being self employed , I managed to get myself to my clinic doing limited duties as I was on crutches, still waiting to hear back from ACC as somehow I had to try to continue work as my business required me to be there to at least answer the phone. . Finally I got a letter from an ACC case manager half way through December saying that they would accept my claim & I needed to fill out numerous forms showing my earnings etc\nAfter completing one lot I was told I had been given the wrong ones & I would need to fill out another\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 All I really wanted was someone to help me with housework & everyday tasks around the house I was unable to do and a rehabilitation plan for my leg.\nIt was then Christmas & at the 7 & \u00bd week anniversary of my accident I managed to trip on a step & re-rupture the Achilles! After surgery to stitch the Achilles which by now had been completely ruptured, I got home and on the Monday started ringing my case manger requesting a written rehab plan & a face to face meeting with someone.\nAfter searching the Net for information on how to manage an Achilles injury I found an article written by Gary Moller who has been extremely helpful in the steps I needed to take with my injury.\nThe meeting with ACC was finally organised for 24th January 2008, after a lot of frustration and numerous calls to answer phones,\u2013 15 weeks after my injury! I wish I knew what I know now back on the 10 November 2007 - Annette\n______________________________________\nGary Moller comments:\nAnnette's story is not unusual; in fact it could be argued that this is usual of the standard of care by our hospital system and ACC (Accident Compensation Corporation). What is that standard: Appalling! Annette is an experienced health professional. Just imagine how a person gets on if English is their second language or they come from a country where asserting oneself against authority risks becoming an organ donor!\nThe motto for our hospitals should be \"Patch 'em up and Push 'em out\". ACC's motto should be \"Obfuscate and Frustrate\".\nEffective rehabilitation is both timely and appropriate and Annette received neither, starting with substandard treatment for the first injury which should have been properly assessed and repaired. Recurrence of the injury was highly likely since the tendon was probably just hanging together by a thread despite several weeks of immobilisation. The second repair job was very good as far as one can tell. My message to the hospitals is to stop doing repairs on the cheap and to do it right first time round.\nThe service by ACC has been appalling by any standards, seriously stressing this self-employed person. What's going on here with ACC?\nI have seen this kind of thing happen often enough to conclude that ACC will, as a matter of course, decline every significant injury no matter how obvious the fact that it is an injury and not something else. Delay, delay, delay, complicate and bury the poor Claimant up to their neck in paperwork. Most people will simply give up with frustration and exhaustion, saving the ACC thousands, if not millions of collective dollars per year. By the time a declined claim is successfully disputed, the first few months of greatest need have passed and ACC refuses to back date costs incurred, such as the home help that the desperate claimant arranged privately in the absence of ACC funded assistance. The accident victim therefore bears the brunt of the costs of an injury despite having paid into the scheme through a tax on her wages. This is heartless money-grubbing by any standards.\nRehabilitation may be little more than a dozen or so of physiotherapy treatments. If recovery is incomplete and return to work has not been achieved, the Claimant is shunted off to a cooperative Occupational Physician who goes through the motions of a sham medical assessment and then writes a stock report for ACC stating that this person is capable of being a filing mindless clerical or toll booth operator, or something similar. Not to mention that that person was a highly skilled professional prior to the accident. Regardless of whether or not that person is able to do the job or if the jobs even exist, she is given a couple of months to find a job. If not, the hapless Claimant is shifted onto a welfare benefit and off ACC and chalked up as a success for the annual report. This bureaucratic process is not rehabilitation. As Annette's case illustrates, what I am describing does go on and I have come across many examples.\nSadly, I have no easy answers, other than to suggest that a Claimant hire a lawyer at the first signs that ACC is dragging its heels. Hiring a lawyer can be lawyer is costly; but doing so usually results in the best service ACC can offer. The first consultation is usually free, so there is nothing to lose nothing to lose and much to gain by at least a single legal consultation.\nThe long term solution is for there to be institutional changes within ACC that recognise that there is a difference between rehabilitation and process. I recognise that ACC does a lot of very good things; but it could be doing its job so much better. It has many dedicated employees (I should know since I was one for several years!) who need to be better supported and resourced to provide front-line services.\nBeware of the Boot Camp\nOn another matter: Annette was participating in a \"Boot Camp\" style workout session at the time of her Achilles tendon rupture. I am wary of these relatively uncontrolled workout programmes because the possibility of injury is relatively high. These boot camps are really popular due to the influence of programmes on TV like the \"Biggest Loser\". What we never hear about are the casualties they cause along the way.\nAnnette placed her trust in a professional fitness instructor. It was an unfortunate accident as far as one can tell. In fortunate it may have been; it still is very poor form on the Instructor's part not to follow up on Annette. There was no follow up and when Annette contacted her; the conversation was cut short each time because her fitness instructor was in a hurry. Here is what a true professional fitness consultant would do for Annette:\nEnsure that she gets prompt medical care and the best of care. She should help with her medical and travel expenses (The instructor might even have insurance for this purpose).\nFollow up the next day with a personal visit, a card, flowers etc.\nOffer to provide rehabilitation services Annette needed so desperately.\n"}, {"score": 271.13605, "uuid": "1d93835c-e112-522b-a4d8-3553a9c52b05", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1514wb-36-21868", "target_hostname": "blog.garymoller.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.garymoller.com/2011/01/is-fluoride-good-for-you.html", "page_rank": 1.1748371e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": ": <em>Is</em> Fluoride good for you?", "snippet": "* <em>The</em> health bureaucrats who are aligned with aluminium industry interests are either ignorant of <em>the</em> critical <em>differences</em> between Sodium Fluoride and <em>what</em> naturally occurs in our bodies (Calcium Fluoride), or they simply do not care.", "explanation": null, "document": "Gary Moller: [DipPhEd PGDipRehab PGDipSportMed(Otago)FCE Certified, Kordel's and Nutra-Life Certified Natural Health Consultant].

I obtained it during a most fascinating course on the use of tissue salts therapy, so not sure as to its availability.\nWhen we are talking about calcium fluoride as part of therapy, we are referring to very tiny doses, probably much lower concentrations than the sodium fluoride that comes via our water supplies.\nAccording to Dr Les Fisher, Director of Active Elements PTY, who has over 40 years fulltime experience dispensing tissue salts, calcium fluoride is at least 50 times less toxic than sodium fluoride.\nOne question I have yet to answer adequately is this: \"If huge doses of calcium fluoride is obtained via toothpaste and equal doses of sodium fluoride via our water, then how does that affect concurrent homeopathic treatments?\"\nI hope to have this answer for you soon. I need to know as much as others do.\nJust a point: calcium fluoride therapy is never on its own (In my case anyway). It is one of a combination of tissue salts.\n"}, {"score": 288.1828, "uuid": "13ff4211-2ba9-5505-874f-dcbb82da1cae", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1218wb-01-14642", "target_hostname": "peakperformance.runnersworld.com", "target_uri": "http://peakperformance.runnersworld.com/2010/03/march-8-which-is-better-rearfoot-striking-or-midfootforefoot-an-experiment-of-one/", "page_rank": 1.1754413e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "March 8: Which <em>Is</em> Better\u2013Rearfoot Striking Or Midfoot&#x2F;Forefoot?", "snippet": "a <em>difference</em> of 1-3 bpm <em>is</em> actually biologically significant <em>difference</em> <em>is</em> still questionable.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nI never set out to spend as much time as I have thinking about running shoes, lack\nof running shoes, forefoot striking and rearfoot striking. There are plenty of other interesting areas of running to investigate and write about. Then again, what's more important than injuries? And performance? Who isn't interested in both, and how shoes and running form might relate to both?\nAbebe Bikila, Ron Hill and Bruce Tulloh were among my earliest influences in the sport--occasional barefooters all. After meeting Connecticut barefoot icon Dr. Charlie Robbins in the mid 1960s, I raced barefoot a few times myself. In early 1984, I was the first American to run with barefoot sensation Zola Budd. I spent years fiddling with my stride, mainly my foot plant, trying to figure out how to get faster. [Pictured: A pair of \"World 10\" racing shoes that Ron Hill sent me in the late 1960s or early 1970s. I raced short road distances in them several times. They weigh about 3 ounces each.]\nThat said, I always fell back to a rear foot strike with a short, shuffle stride. It was what felt \"natural\" to me, and it seemed to work well. At 63 years and 103,000+ lifetime miles, I haven't been injured in the last 15 years. I'm not setting the world on fire, but I'll take what I've got.\nLast year was the year of barefoot running, thanks largely to Chris McDougall's rollicking book, Born to Run. BTR got great media pickup because editors everywhere loved the \"man bites dog\" slant: Expensive running shoes are worse than no shoes at all! McDougall couldn't prove his point, but he didn't have to, because the running-shoe companies couldn't prove that their shoes prevent injuries. They seemed guilty by omission.\nMcDougall's book appeared just as a burgeoning \"evolutionary fitness\" movement was picking up steam. Are French Fries as healthy as whole potatoes? Nope. Is late-night TV watching as good for you as a full, restorative 8 hours sleep in the cave? Nope again. Did Paleo man wear thick-soled, motion-control shoes? Not the last time anyone checked.\nThis year the conversation seems likely to move on. For a variety of reasons, about 99.9 percent of runners will continue wearing shoes of some kind while they run. (In the Boston Marathon, it would take 25+ barefoot runners to exceed .1 percent. Someone should attempt a count.)\nThis year we runners will be talking about minimalist shoes like the Nike FREE and Vibram Five Fingers, and the dozens of stripped-down shoes that will mimic them. Is less better? Many will argue in the affirmative. We'll also be talking about where the rubber meets the road: at the heel, or at the midfoot or forefoot. Many will follow in the footsteps of the Pose and Chi camps, which have for some time been proposing a midfoot landing.\nThe two eternal questions will remain: Does one style of running reduce injuries vs. the other? Does one increase your speed vs. the other? The injury question will be tough\u00a0 to answer because it will require that someone measure a large group of runners for a long period of time. Even on an individual basis, it's hard to suss out cause and effect. I'm injury free now. Great. But why? Someone else has an injury now. Is it because of his/her shoes, or a training error, a furniture-moving accident, or the passage of too many decades? Hard to say.\nOn the other hand, Running Economy is relatively easy to measure in real time. Last week I performed a simple self-test. I ran 3-minute repeats on a treadmill at my tempo pace in a super-minimalist pair of racing flats while landing on my heels (one condition) or my midfeet (a second condition). I even finished off with a final test run in socks only (essentially barefoot). Between repeats, I walked slowly for 3 minutes as a recovery. I measured every second of my workout with a heart-rate monitor to get a reasonable gauge of my effort. In particular, I noted my heart-rate before each 3-minute repeat, and at the end of each repeat.\nIf any of the conditions gave me a lower heart-rate after three minutes of tempo-running, that would be the \"winner\"--the one that produced the best Running Economy.\u00a0 The Table below summarizes the results of my \"experiment.\" The key finding is in the column labeled \"Heart Rate at end of Tempo.\" It shows basically no difference between my runs while rearfoot striking, forefoot striking or running in socks.\nTherefore, for me, on this one day, and under these conditions, there didn't seem to be much performance difference between rearfoot- and forefoot-striking.\nCONDITION\nHR AT END OF TEMPO\nRearfoot striking\n"}, {"score": 271.75946, "uuid": "2fc54325-efa9-5804-b1ae-c6a9c8d8dc64", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1218wb-43-23168", "target_hostname": "peakperformance.runnersworld.com", "target_uri": "http://peakperformance.runnersworld.com/2010/02/feb-4-running-is-a-waste-of-time-grabby-headline-bad-reporting/", "page_rank": 1.1753979e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Feb. 4: \u201cRunning <em>Is</em> a Waste of Time\u201d: Grabby Headline, Bad Reporting |", "snippet": "In comparison to cars and gas mileage, vo2 max <em>is</em> like <em>the</em> size of your gas tank: a big tank probably lets you drive more miles in <em>the</em> car (unless efficiency <em>is</em> really low).

I\u2019d like to add to the discussion, sorry for the long post.\nThe article in the London Daily Telegraph certainly put a spin on the results of the study conducted in the JAP article, but it wasn\u2019t completely wrong. Firstly, the JAP article never said that running is a waste of time. Actually they didn\u2019t say anything about running because the test subjects were cycling as a measure of aerobic activity. However, the JAP article did demonstrate that cycling (aerobic activity) doesn\u2019t have a 100% positive effect for improving VO2 Max. The most useful part (maybe the only useful part) of the article in the Telegraph was a quote from the study which states:\n\u201cWe know that low maximal oxygen consumption is a strong risk factor for premature illness and death so the tendency is for public health experts to automatically prescribe aerobic exercise to increase oxygen capacity.\n\"Our hope is that before too long, they will be able to target that prescription just to those who may stand a greater chance of benefiting, and prescribe more effective preventive or therapeutic measures to the others.\u201d\nThis is important because before this study it was believed that aerobic activity would be beneficial to everyone. If there is 20% of the population that won\u2019t benefit from this activity (which is a significant portion), then having a way to identify those individuals would be a major breakthrough. Those 20% would be better off finding other therapeutic measures to improve their health (instead of wasting their time jogging as the telegraph puts it). In this study they found some genetic predictors that show a strong correlation of predicting VO2 Max improvement through intense aerobic activity.\nPosted by eeave:\nThe test subjects only worked out for 30 minutes five days a week. So maybe slower-responders need to titrate up their exercise time to get the benefit that the 80% of genetically different people get at less mileage.\nMy comments:\nThe article in the Telegraph never actually said that the subjects did 30min/5 days a week. They CLEVERLY said the participants underwent training programs that were in line with the government\u2019s recommendation of 30 min/5 days a week. The actual training programs were much more varied than that. There were 3 groups in the study, each with a different training program.\nGroup 1 consisted of 24 young sedentary healthy males doing a 6 week program of 45min cycling sessions at 70% VO2 Max 4 times a week.\nGroup 2 consisted of 17 young active participants doing a 12 weeks program that was much more intensive than Group 1. Their program included interval training and longer distance training (2 hour session on Fridays) that increased in intensity by 5% in the first 6 weeks and 1% in the last 6 weeks.\nGroup 3 was a study cohort which consisted of 473 healthy sedentary participants. This group did a 20 week program with 3 sessions per week. The first 2 weeks were 30 min at 55% VO2 Max. This was gradually increased up to 50 min at 75% VO2 Max, which was reached by week 14 and maintained until week 20.\nPosted by eeave:\nThey didn't try that. Instead their conclusion is that by using genetic mapping, they can tell some people to forget about exercise and just rely on diet and drugs.\nIf the point is that aerobic fitness is related to long life because the body can handle oxygen better, it doesn't seem that diet and drugs alone would do that. How about expanding exercise time till they get an obvious therapeutic effect?\nMy comments:\nThe researchers in the JAP article NEVER said to forget about exercise. However, they did demonstrate that exercise didn\u2019t improve the VO2 Max for 20% of the participants in their study and more importantly they identified certain genetic predictors of those 20%. This is incredibly important because those 20% may find other therapeutic measures more effective than exercise. Even more important, they potentially found a way for us to predict who WILL NOT improve their VO2 Max through exercise.\nPosted by Brad:\nDid the participants in this study actually run intervals or did they just \"jog\" for 30 minutes, 5 times per week?\nMy comments:\nThere was no running. The participants cycled in a lab.\nPosted by JC:\nShouldn\u2019t most runners be more concerned about VO2 Sub max? (I don\u2019t think most people are at max capacity in 5Ks and greater distances?) From what I understand; person \u201cA\u201d could have a lower VO2 max then person \u201cB\u201d, but \u201cA\u201d may have an equal or better efficiency than person \u201cB\u201d at sub max intensities and therefore perform better? Please let me know if I am understanding this correctly.\nMy comments:\nI would like to offer an addition to AMBY\u2019s comment. The JAP article is not about performance, it\u2019s about the relationship between low VO2 Max and premature mortality. Because a low VO2 Max is correlated to premature mortality, if we can improve VO2 Max we can improve our health and reduce premature mortality. Generally aerobic exercise is prescribed to improve VO2 Max. If some people cannot improve VO2 Max through intense aerobic activity, then they may be better off finding other therapeutic methods. Of even more significance, are there ways to use genetics to predict who won\u2019t improve their VO2 Max through aerobic activity? That\u2019s what this study investigates.\n"}, {"score": 286.8156, "uuid": "1f08ca34-b63f-582c-afd3-e86a341c7ef6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100tw-45-11582", "target_hostname": "episcopaldigitalnetwork.com", "target_uri": "http://episcopaldigitalnetwork.com/ens/2012/02/13/presiding-bishop-preaches-in-the-philippines/", "page_rank": 1.65334e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "Presiding bishop preaches in <em>the</em> Philippines", "snippet": "Naaman <em>is</em> a powerful military leader, but he\u2019s in trouble because people can see he\u2019s got a skin disease \u2013 and something visible like <em>eczema</em> or <em>psoriasis</em> gives others <em>the</em> idea that there must be something dangerous about him, and they shouldn\u2019t get too close.

Katharine Jefferts Schori\nPresiding Bishop and Primate\nThe Episcopal Church\nI bring you greetings from The Episcopal Church.\u00a0 We\u2019re engaged in God\u2019s mission in about 7000 congregations in 16 nations \u2013 in Taiwan and Micronesia, Honduras, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, as well as the United States.\u00a0 We have been known as the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society since the early 1800s and we continue to try to live into that identity, knowing that God calls us to bridge all the borders that divide and separate human beings.\u00a0 This season of Epiphany reminds us that Jesus crossed the border between heaven and earth for the sake of all families, languages, peoples, and nations.\u00a0 We are sent to do the same kind of border-crossing work.\u00a0 This morning\u2019s celebration is an important example, as the IFI and the ECP continue to move across borders that have separated people in the past.\u00a0 St. Jude\u2019s even sits on the border between two dioceses, perhaps encouraging the faithful to keep crossing over!\u00a0 The relationships among our three churches are a further witness to a divided world, and it\u2019s clear that together we have an ability to challenge the walls of injustice and violence that others try to build in this country and beyond.\nThe lepers in this morning\u2019s readings are stuck behind social borders.\u00a0 They are walled off from their communities, forbidden to cross into \u201cclean\u201d territory.\u00a0 Maybe you\u2019ve seen an air curtain in an architecturally innovative building.\u00a0 Those air curtains are designed to separate the outside from the inside \u2013 usually to keep the temperature inside the building more constant, to save energy and keep the air cleaner.\u00a0 Clean rooms for surgery or manufacturing computer chips are similarly designed to keep the inside environment sterile.\nNaaman and the leper in the gospel live in a hermetically sealed world like that, shut away from neighbors by an invisible wall, only they\u2019re on the outside, looking in.\u00a0 Their skin diseases give very public evidence of their uncleanness, and their societies have walled them off from interaction with so-called \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d people.\u00a0 Being unclean is much more a social disease than a physical one.\u00a0 In the ancient world there were other ways of being unclean that couldn\u2019t be seen by your neighbors.\u00a0 The lepers know they are judged unclean, and if you read carefully, you\u2019ll discover that they ask to be cleansed, rather than healed.\u00a0 The varieties of uncleanness are evidenced by the requirement that their newly clean state be certified before they\u2019re permitted to rejoin society.\u00a0 It isn\u2019t enough just to look good.\nThe ancient world had a well-defined system for dividing up the world, with societies divided into categories like clean and unclean, sacred and profane, shamed and dignified (or perhaps something like \u2018appropriately proud\u2019).\u00a0 In those days, people were afraid of pollution, both physical and spiritual, and the things you were supposed to stay away from were well known \u2013 dead people, women, foreigners, Samaritans.\u00a0 We would recognize some of those categories today:\u00a0 foreigners, immigrants, adherents of other religious traditions, people from the \u201cwrong\u201d families or parts of town.\u00a0 Adults divide up the world like that, and children do it, too \u2013 you can watch them chalk off the playground, often by gender and in-groups vs. out-groups.\nNaaman is a powerful military leader, but he\u2019s in trouble because people can see he\u2019s got a skin disease \u2013 and something visible like eczema or psoriasis gives others the idea that there must be something dangerous about him, and they shouldn\u2019t get too close.\u00a0 He just might have an evil spirit that will infect us!\nThe gospel leper wants to be clean more than anything else \u2013 he comes on his knees.\u00a0 He and Naaman go looking for restorers, people who will make them clean and once again fit for community interaction.\u00a0 They want to be restored to relationship.\nWe know that orphans don\u2019t thrive if they are put in institutions that only care for their physical needs.\u00a0 Children need to be held and hugged and talked to.\u00a0 Adults need human interaction just as much \u2013 we all eventually begin to shrivel in enforced solitude.\nGospel work is about restoring relationships, with God and neighbor.\u00a0 It\u2019s about cleaning us up for polite and wholesome society, and welcoming us back to the banquet table.\nMost of the pain and dysfunction in human lives, whether it\u2019s poverty, violence, war, arrogance, or oppression, arises from the boundaries we draw between \u201cour\u201d kind of people, the clean ones, and those outside the wall, whom we often define as dirty or less than human.\u00a0 We are pretty good at dressing up those divisions with fancy language, saying that this person is a criminal or an enemy, or that one isn\u2019t \u201cnice,\u201d or that group over there will corrupt my children. In spite of all that division, God keeps looking for ways to break down the walls.\nWho are the lepers around the edges of your community?\u00a0 People who\u2019ve got HIV?\u00a0 Muslims?\u00a0 People from the lowlands?\u00a0 Tourists?\u00a0 Soldiers?\u00a0 What does it take to pronounce them clean and fit for relationship?\nJesus gives us example after example of breaking down those walls.\u00a0 He eats with all sorts of officially unclean people, he talks to women, he touches dirty people, he meets with his enemies, and he invites everybody to the banquet.\nThe people Jesus gathers as disciples are mostly unclean or dubiously righteous:\u00a0 Mary Magdalene, who has been healed from \u201cdemons,\u201d fishermen, a tax collector, at least one revolutionary zealot, and plenty of other folk who know what it is to live on the margins.\u00a0 He is particularly attractive to people on the outs \u2013 that\u2019s who all those crowds of people following him were \u2013 the landless and unemployed, the sick and the poor, and even some of the officially clean people who didn\u2019t feel so clean.\nThose marginal people are often the source of societal cleansing, even when they are feared because of their difference.\u00a0 Look at the slave girl in Naaman\u2019s story, who steps across a border in order to break down a wall.\u00a0 She is a slave because her master\u2019s soldiers captured her.\u00a0 But she offers to help him through one of her home-town prophets.\u00a0 There\u2019s quite a lot of risky boundary-crossing going on here!\nThe outsider is an essential part of our own cleansing, for we cannot be wholly restored to right relationship without him or her.\u00a0 What we see as unclean God has already pronounced good at creation.\u00a0 That one on the outside is God\u2019s beloved daughter or son.\u00a0 Who are we to cry, \u201cunclean, unclean!\u201d\nThe divisions between clean and unclean, inside and outside, friend and stranger, are maintained not only by those who draw the boundaries, but by those who accept those boundaries as normal.\u00a0 Sometimes we participate in our own exclusion by accepting somebody else\u2019s definition of us as \u201cunclean.\u201d\u00a0 That has something to do with the requirement that the leper go and show himself to the priest.\u00a0 He needs somebody else to validate his cleansing.\u00a0 We need others to remind us of our belovedness \u2013 we cannot be whole and healed and holy all alone.\u00a0 It takes a community.\u00a0 Even God is a community.\nAt creation, God pronounces all of it \u201cgood.\u201d\u00a0 Humanity is blessed and called \u201cvery good.\u201d\u00a0 The great creation stories of Genesis insist that human beings are made for relationship, that it is not good for human beings to be alone.\u00a0 We are created for partnership with other human beings and with God, to tend the garden, break down the dividing walls, and bring the unclean inside the community.\u00a0 Who is being left outside?\u00a0 Who needs to hear, \u201cI do choose \u2013 be made clean\u201d?\u00a0 We can say those words and be the ones who restore others to community.\u00a0 All of us at one time or another need to hear those words and experience that restoration ourselves.\u00a0 Will you go and do likewise?\n"}, {"score": 286.75082, "uuid": "12f8d03b-a1b4-5410-8654-c8bc23521a52", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1615wb-07-16143", "target_hostname": "archderm.highwire.org", "target_uri": "http://archderm.highwire.org/cgi/content/full/134/12/1620", "page_rank": 1.1775372e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "Arch Dermatol -- <em>The</em> Cochrane Skin Group: Preparing, Maintaining, and Disseminating", "snippet": "Find out more about why this message <em>is</em> appearing and <em>what</em> you can do to make your experience on this site better.", "explanation": null, "document": "References\nThe benefits of systematic reviews to dermatology may seem limited compared with areas such as stroke or coronary heart disease, in which there are many large RCTs and clear end points, such as death. While this idea may be partially true, it should not be a reason for complacency for 3 main reasons.\nFirst, preliminary searches suggest that dermatology is no worse off in its yield of RCTs than many other branches of medicine. 21 There are currently 3246 trials on the Cochrane Skin Group's Specialised Trials Register, of which about 80% are RCTs. Since it is impossible for even the most conscientious dermatologist to keep abreast of the 100 or so specialist dermatology journals, dermatologists should not assume, based on their own reading profiles or on the basis of a quick MEDLINE search, that trials are not being conducted or published. For example, at the early stages of a recent systematic review of treatments for molluscum contagiosum, the reviewers were confident that no relevant RCTs had been published. Yet, an exhaustive search identified 5 possible studies and 2 ongoing unpublished trials that provided useful data (R. MacSween, MRCP,written communication, May 1997).\nSecond is the role of systematic reviews of dermatological treatments for identifying gaps in knowledge that should become urgent research priorities. Sometimes a review based on an important question may not reveal any RCTs. This provides essential information for grant proposals for trials 22 if a strong argument can be made for supporting such a trial, eg, widespread use of a treatment in the absence of evidence. Clinicians also may be reassured by such a \"null\" systematic review, which suggests that they are not missing some new evidence that should be used in their current practice and that they might be justified in continuing their own favorite therapeutic practices based on trial and error or anecdote until better evidence becomes available. It is only when we highlight our current collective ignorance of dermatological therapies that we can begin to ask the right questions and progress from the current state of clinical entropy that characterizes the treatment of so many dermatological diseases ( Figure 1 ). Rarer dermatological diseases pose a particular problem, but judging from the success in organizing the results of RCTs into leukemia treatments, few diseases are not amenable to multicenter or international RCTs.\nView larger version (114K):\n[in a new window]\nIt is only when we highlight our current collective ignorance that we can progress from the current state of clinical entropy that characterizes the treatment of so many dermatological diseases. Even in 1998, we are still unclear about the relative cost-effectiveness of short bursts of potent vs longer-term mild topical corticosteroids, azathioprine vs cyclosporine, or dietary manipulation vs house dust mite reduction in the treatment of this 6-year-old child with severe atopic dermatitis.\nRelated to the issue of identifying gaps in knowledge, is the role of individual reviewers in helping to frame the future research agenda for dermatology. If we confine systematic reviews to areas in which many RCTs are conducted, then the work of the group becomes driven by data rather than by questions. Since the clinical trial agenda of a small specialty such as dermatology is heavily governed by the priorities of the pharmaceutical industry, reviewers who limit their reviews to areas with substantial data risk collusion with such an agenda. For example, approximately half of the dermatologists in the United Kingdom use azathioprine to treat severe atopic dermatitis, yet we are not aware of one RCT to support its use. 23 This does not mean that azathioprine is not an effective treatment for this disease, since absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of no effect. 24 Yet, it is unlikely that manufacturers of this generically available drug would fund RCTs for a drug that is no longer under patent protection. Cyclosporine on the other hand, a relatively expensive and potentially toxic proprietary drug, has undergone at least 7 trials for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. 25 - 31 A systematic review of the use of cyclosporine for atopic dermatitis may confirm its efficacy in this condition, but it will not address topics that may be of more interest to dermatologists and patients, such as the use of azathioprine, the role of diet in disease prevention, or the possible benefits of habit reversal. 32 It is important, therefore, that the Cochrane Skin Group (herewith referred to as the Group) start with questions that are important to patients and that it does not limit itself to areas in which many trials are conducted.\nThe third main reason that dermatology can benefit from systematic reviews is that such reviews provide an excellent opportunity to identify and promote research into methodological problems that are common to dermatological diseases. Difficulties in measuring the outcomes of inflammatory dermatological diseases, such as acne, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis, with reliable valid tools that measure aspects of the disease that are important to patients have been highlighted in previous attempts at meta-analyses. 33 - 35 One study of 44 dermatology trials with \"negative\" conclusions found that all but one had a greater than 10% risk of missing a 25% relative treatment difference and that 70% were so small that they had a serious risk of missing a 50% relative treatment difference. 16 The quality of drug trial reporting is another aspect that systematic reviews are able to highlight. For example, a study of 62 clinical trials of psoriasis listed in the Cumulated Index Medicus for the years 1988 and 1989 found that previous treatments (possibly an important determinant of a new treatment response) were not stated in 60 of those trials. 35 Another study of 62 dermatological clinical trials by Bigby et al 36 found that the method was reported only 41% of the time, ranging from 3% for power and method of randomization to 76% for loss to follow-up and use of control subjects. The European Dermato-Epidemiology Network (also known as EDEN) is conducting a systematic review of clinical trial methods for comparative trials of psoriasis treatments. 37 Such studies are useful for identifying methodological research priorities for these common diseases. It may be argued, for instance, that research to develop better internationally accepted outcome measures for dermatological diseases should be our No. 1 priority for dermatological research, rather than conducting many small trials using the profusion of outcome measures of unknown validity that are in use. 38\nWhile dermatological systematic reviews may never achieve the same effect as similar reviews in cardiovascular medicine, the benefit of the work of the Group should be judged by what it can achieve, not by what it cannot achieve.\nHISTORY AND STRUCTURE OF THE COCHRANE SKIN GROUP\nJump to Section\n"}]]}
