The process of distillation removes minerals and chemicals from water. You are left with clean water that is better for your plants. All plants benefit from the use of distilled water, but it is even more important for indoor plants. You can purchase distilled water at the grocery store or make your own distilled water at home.\nWhy Distilled is Better than Tap Water\nTap water contains chemicals, such as chlorine, that are used to treat the public water supply. These chemicals are damaging to plants. The effect of the chemicals is more profound on your house plants than in your outdoor plants. The reason is the chemicals in the water build up in the soil and aren\u2019t washed away by rain, as happens with outdoor plants.\nChemicals aren\u2019t the only tap water problem. The hardness of the water can also impact your plants. If you have hard water, you will want to use distilled water for your house plants. Some plants are very sensitive to the minerals in hard water. Hard water is most often an issue with well water, but can be a problem with a municipal water supply as well.\nIf your water is supplied by a well, you may have a water softener system in your home. These systems are great for removing the hardness from the well water. Your soaps and shampoos will work better and there is less staining of your appliances and sinks. However, the softener is not good for your plants. Softeners use salts, such as sodium or potassium in the recycling process. These salts are very damaging to your plants. The softened water contains a high level of salt combined with a low level of important nutrients such as calcium and magnesium, which impedes growth.\nIf you have softened well water, you will want to use distilled water on both your indoor and outdoor plants. The outdoor plants are affected by softened water much more than by tap water supplied by your local community. This water contains heavy concentrations of salts, which hinder the growth of your plants. The salts can actually kill the plants along with your grass.\nWatering with Distilled Water\nIt\u2019s important to water your plants properly, whether you are using distilled or tap water. If not watered properly, it won\u2019t matter what type of water you are using. Improper watering leads to a weak root system. This weakens the plant and makes it more vulnerable to disease. Follow the directions for watering your plants to be sure you are watering each of your plants properly.\nDirections for care come with many houseplants. These are usually printed on plastic stakes that are placed in the soil inside the pot. Not all plants come with the care instructions. You may have to look up the information in a book or online. In general, blooming plants and those with a lot of foliage require more water than plants with less foliage. Tropical and woodland plants need less water than plants from dry areas.\nThe season will also impact the water needs of your plants. When the temperature is higher, the plants will need more water. This is because the water tends to evaporate faster at higher temperatures. The temperature in the house will impact the plants as well as the outdoor temperature. When the heat is on in the winter months, you may notice your plants get thirsty faster. The heat causes the air in the home to become dry, which causes the water in the plants to evaporate faster.\nWhen using distilled water on your plants, be sure the water is room temperature. If you make your own water and leave it outside for distillation, bring it back in the house and allow it to reach room temperature. The water can get very hot in the summer or quite cold in the colder months. Very hot or very cold water can shock the roots and damage, or even kill your house plants.\nMaking Your Own Distilled Water\nYou can make your own distilled water at home. You can either use tap water or catch rain water in a bucket or barrel. Rain water works well for making distilled water as long as the water is not too acidic. If the rain water in your area tends to be acidic, you are better off using tap water. Acids don\u2019t dissipate well and can damage your plants.\nFill the container with water from the tap and set it outside. If you will be using rain water, place a clean container outside to catch the rain. Leave the container outside for two days to allow the chlorine or other minerals to dissipate. The water is then ready to use on your plants. You can store some of the water in clean, gallon size jugs for later use.\n"}, {"score": 2005.6722, "uuid": "875abb0f-f04b-5f9d-a892-cf631b3ff779", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1807wb-63-07889", "target_hostname": "www.autotaps.com", "target_uri": "http://www.autotaps.com/water-consevation-tips.html", "page_rank": 1.5240158e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Water</em> Conservation Tips | Upto 70% <em>water</em> conservation , <em>water</em> saving <em>taps</em>", "snippet": "Check <em>for</em> home <em>for</em> leaks, hidden <em>water</em> leaks can be wasting <em>water</em> without you even being aware of it.

Muskie, U.S. Senator; speech, 1 March 1966\nIntroduction To Water Quality:\nWater has been called the universal solvent because so many substances will dissolve in it. Water also can carry many materials in suspension. Unfortunately, water is not particularly selective in which compounds become dissolved or suspended. The water that dissolves your coffee or tea and sugar in the morning or that you use to reconstitute your orange juice or infant's formula might also have dissolved some atoms of lead from the rocks in the underground aquifer it flowed though or picked up a microgram of 2,4 D from the farm up-stream from the filtration plant. If your water is chlorinated it almost certainly contains a few micrograms of chloroform (a byproduct of the disinfection process).\nThe question you need to ask is not, \"does my tap water contain contaminants\" - nearly all water outside of laboratory distilled, deionized water does. The real questions are, \"what are the contaminates in my water, what are their concentration levels, and do they pose short or long term health risks at those levels\".\nFinding answers to these questions is not easy. The answers depend on where you live (country, city, surrounding land use, etc.), the primary source of your drinking water (deep or shallow well or surface water), your water supplier (private or community well, small or large municipal water system), and what is happening at any moment as your water travels from its source through the treatment/distribution system to your faucet.\nWater that is reasonably contaminant free (and safe) one moment may become dangerously contaminated the next because of accident, neglect, or some natural event. One of the most notorious recent examples of water that was safe one day and dangerous the next was during the summer of 1993 in Milwaukee when one-fourth of the people living in the metro area (over 400,000) became ill with cryptosporidiosis (discussed below). According to the article, Tapwater at Risk , the contamination of Milwaukee's water supply was a combination of natural events (heavy rains) and accident (improperly installed monitoring equipment) that allowed the parasite to pass though the city's purification system and into the distribution system. More recently (August, 1998) the citizens of Sydney Australia were told that Cryptosporidia had been detected in their municipal water supply. There are over a month of stories detailing the contamination of Sydney's water supply archived on The Sydney Morning Herald Water Crisis page. Fortunately, despite a two day delay in informing the population, there had apparently been no reported cases of death or illness linked to the contamination by September 7, 1998.\nGovernments and most water providers are extremely interested in supplying safe water to their citizens and/or customers. Consequently, barring accidents, the majority of dangerous contaminants that are liable to be in the drinking water of most Americans (and people from other developed countries) are typically present in minute amounts. They may contribute to health problems only after many years of exposure, making identification of the cause difficult, if not impossible. Examples of this type of contaminant are lead (that can either occur naturally in water or can be dissolved out of distribution pipes or plumbing fixtures in the home) which causes intellectual deficits in children, and trihalomethanes (byproducts of chlorine disinfection) that have been linked to a slight, but significant, increase in the chance of getting certain cancers after 20 - 50 years of drinking chlorinated water. I have collected a list of sites that focus on water safety regulations in the U.S.\nWater treatment is not a simple issue, It is, rather a delicate balancing act. There is an ongoing and vigorous debate among the various groups interested in drinking water safety concerning the costs, the benefits, and the risks of every aspect of the water treatment and distribution business. Anything that is done to treat municipal water costs money, provides the benefit of water that has reduced levels of the targeted contaminants, and decreases risk of disease from the targeted contaminants. The treatment process may also add substances to the water that would increases risks of other disease for the people who drink the water. You can view a list of sites that discuss these issues, or read about a situation in Peru where the risks of water treatment vrs the risks of no treatment were misjudged with disastrous results.\nI suspect that in your reading you will find that in the United States and other countries, there are many committed people who are doing \u00a0a good job to ensure that the water delivered to your home is safe for drinking. \u00a0These are scientists who are trying to figure out the effects of various chemicals and pathogens on the human body or discover better treatment technologies, government regulators who try to identify, monitor, and regulate the amount of certain contaminants\u00a0allowed in water, and professionals in the water industry who strive to deliver safe, quality water to their customers.\nYou will also discover that 'the system' does not always work. \u00a0Accidents happen, mistakes are made, systems wear out, toxic chemicals are released into the environment to find their way into the surface and ground water, regulators fail to regulate, population growth in a region puts more stress on a water system than it can handle, and any number of other weak links in the chain of processes that must function properly to deliver \u00a0safe water to your faucet.\nThe web sites concerning general water quality issues are a good place to begin your research. The top couple of references contain a wealth of information.\nSo, are there reasons to be concerned about your drinking water safety? Your answer to that question must depend on the results of your own research. The site links listed below and information in the other pages at this site contain a tremendous amount of information on water quality. You might also want to contact your water provider and obtain a \"Treated Water Quality Summary Report\" (The Water Quality Report from Denver Water is a good example of what to request - note: to view the actual contaminant levels, click on \"Treated Water Quality Roundup\" \u00a0at the very bottom of the page\u00a0). If you use well water you should have your water tested periodically to make certain that it is contaminant free.\nFrom everything I have read, people in the US who have the most reasons to be concerned about their water are those served by small water treatment plants - particularly in agricultural regions of the country or areas with a number of industrial plants. \u00a0Also, anyone using water from a shallow well should keep a close eye on their water's quality - again, the most common areas of concern would be in agricultural or industrial areas. \u00a0This is, of course, not to say that all small water treatment plants or shallow wells will have contaminated water. Nor does it mean that all water from large municipal treatment plants or deep wells will be contaminant free. \u00a0The Environmental Protection Agency's Safe drinking water Query Form will allow you to locate your drinking water supplier and view its violations and enforcement history since 1993.\nAm I concerned about the safety of my tap water? Concerned, yes --- Panicked, no. I live in Denver, Colorado, and my family and I use municipal water supplied by Denver Water The taste of their water is excellent (hardly a taste of residual chlorine) and all of the harmful chemicals for which they test fall well below the Environmental Protection Agency Maximum Contaminant Level (or MCL) (most are below the levels of detection). Despite the good taste and safe test results of our water, my research into drinking water issues convinced me to purchase a high quality water filter for the following reasons:\na) I do not like the idea of me or my family drinking even a little bit of chloroform on a daily daily basis over the course of a lifetime (the chlorination of Denver water produces between ten and fifty micrograms of chloroform per liter of water - these levels are produced by nearly any treatment facility that adds chlorine disinfectant to surface water);\nb) We live in an old home and I am concerned about lead in the pipe solder and plumbing fixtures possibly leaching into the water;\nc) I want to ensure the safety of my family in the event of some accident in the water purification/distribution system;\nd) Even good quality chlorinated water tastes much better with the residual chlorine removed; and\ne) I figured that with contaminants constantly increasing in our environment, removing one of the potential sources of harmful chemicals or disease causing organisms was something positive that I could do very easily for my family. The information that I have read about effects of contaminants on children was particularly sobering.\nChildren and the Risks of Contaminated Water:\nThe following excerpt from a report entitled Just Add Water from the Environmental Working Group by Brian A. Cohen, Richard Wiles, Erik D. Olson, and Chris Campbell, should help families recognize the importance of drinking pure, contaminant free water.\nDrinking water standards have many other shortcomings beyond their failure to regulate common drinking water contaminants such as radon, Cryptosporidium and pesticides like cyanazine. One of the most serious is the fact that most current federal drinking water standards do not make any specific accommodation for the special risks and heavy consumption of water by infants and young children.\nOne-year-olds drink more than twice as much water relative to their size as adults. Measured in terms of total fluid intake, an adult would have to drink 35 cans of soda per day to match the drinking habits of the average one-year-old. Because of this, infants and young children are exposed to more water-borne contaminants, relative to their size, than adults. (emphasis mine) This higher exposure combined with the increased vulnerability of infants to many chemical and microbiological contaminants, means infants and young children face increased risks from virtually all contaminants in drinking water, and that current standards almost always do not provide adequate protections for this vulnerable portion of the population.\nIn October of 1995, the EPA announced a new policy to protect infants and children from exposure to toxic substances. At that time, EPA Administrator Carol Browner noted that the policy:\n\"...will, for the first time, ensure that we consistently and explicitly evaluate environmental health risks of infants and children in all risk assessments, risk characterizations, and environmental and public health standards that we set for the nation.\" (EPA 1995)\nIn justifying the need for this new policy the EPA cited two National Academy of Sciences studies (NRC 1993, NRC 1994) that called for major policy changes at the EPA to integrate explicit protections for children when evaluating health risks from environmental contaminants.\nTo date, just two (lead and nitrate) of the more than eighty drinking water standards have been set explicitly to protect infants and children from immediate or long term health risk. No standards have been modified since the EPA policy was announced.\nSimilarly, drinking water standards do not account for multiple contaminants in a single glass of water. Instead, they are set as though people are exposed to one contaminant at a time, which very often is not the case.\n(End of excerpt)\nChildren and Water Contaminants The links here, for the most part, address general topics regarding children and drinking water. There are, however, specific contaminants that affect children to greater extent than adults. They include, Lead, Nitrates, some of the Organic contaminants, and probably the Endocrine disruptors. These topics are listed under their own headings.\nOur Children At Risk . The 5 Worst Environmental Threats To Their Health - Chapter 7, Drinking Water Contamination.\nDue to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), America's drinking water is safer than it has been in decades, and of better quality than that of many other countries. Accordingly, many Americans believe that while people elsewhere may have reason to be concerned about getting sick from contaminated tap water, we are safe. Yet, incidents in the United States - such as the outbreak of the microorganism cryptosporidium in Milwaukee's water supply in 1993 that killed more than one hundred people and sickened over 400,000, and lead and pesticide contamination - while not affecting most, threaten the tap water of millions of Americans. In truth, according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data, in 1994 and 1995, 45 million Americans drank water from water systems that fell short of SDWA standards.\n"}, {"score": 1861.153, "uuid": "fe0043e1-0d23-5005-a1fa-b908f65b0956", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1009wb-76-17145", "target_hostname": "www.fijiwater.com", "target_uri": "http://www.fijiwater.com/2010/fiji-water-reopen-plant/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "FIJI <em>Water</em> to Reopen <em>Plant</em> | FIJI <em>Water</em>", "snippet": "I love your <em>water</em>, but if I was in your shoes I would be looking <em>for</em> a new place to set up shop.

The growth in bottled water production has increased water extraction in areas near bottling plants, leading to water shortages that affect nearby consumers and farmers.

These things can be an eyesore, so let\u2019s check out some alternatives to using a water barrel.\nOne alternative to the rain barrel is the cistern. A cistern is very similar to a barrel, but it is bigger and located underground. Cisterns require a more complicated catchment system and will cost more money than a barrel. It will be less of an eyesore, however. A cistern can easily provide non-potable water for in-house use.\nAnother way to collect rainwater is to build a drainage system that collects in a manmade. This pond should gather all your rainwater. It is an attractive way to be green, and although the water can be harvested to wash the car or do the laundry, it might just be better to look at. Plus, the water's not really going to waste. It's only there temporarily until it evaporates and falls as rain somewhere else. It's kind of like a halfway house for rain.\nRainwater harvesting is suitable for work, home, schools, hospitals, offices and commercial premises.It can typically be used to flush toilets, washing your vehicle and watering plants and gardens. Using rainwater in and around your home is an effective way to conserve water supplies and reduce the amount of mains water you use saving you plenty on your water bill.\nRainwater also reduces the demand on rivers and groundwater. Especially in ever increasing populations where water shortages are on the rise.\nRainwater is soft, and leaves no lime scale and washing clothes in soft water requires less detergent and so reduces water pollution from these compounds. Plants love rainwater since it doesn\u2019t contain any chlorine.\n"}], [{"score": 1686.6362, "uuid": "0a7fec9d-7a53-5315-96a6-d413dbaea0f6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0309wb-83-24342", "target_hostname": "cio.co.nz", "target_uri": "http://cio.co.nz/cio.nsf/printer/14AF5EF732DC9844CC2572BB007BC104", "page_rank": 1.1738458e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "CIO &gt; <em>Tap</em> turns on the <em>water</em>", "snippet": "But it\u2019s Watercare\u2019s business \u2014 delivering clean, grade-A <em>water</em> to 1.2 million people \u2014 that <em>is</em> more likely to be keeping Foley awake <em>than</em> the product of the nearest Starbucks.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tap turns on the water\nBy Chris Bell | Friday, April 13 2007\nRepeat business is the name of the game for Watercare Services CIO Mike Foley, in an industry where disposal of waste is as important as the delivery of a product whose consumers just expect it to be there when they turn on the tap.\nAuckland\u2019s Nuffield Street in Newmarket isn\u2019t the place that springs to mind when you think of the city\u2019s water operations. You imagine a building camouflaged by dense bush, perhaps, overlooking a dam or a reservoir in the Waitakeres. But the upmarket suburb is the location for Watercare Services\u2019 new corporate headquarters and you can find Mike Foley, its CIO, in the former Mercury Energy building; an open-plan office accommodating 200 people from operations, asset development, IS and corporate finance.\nFoley sees Nuffield Street as a fresh start for Watercare. Operations and management had previously been spread across two sites in Onehunga and the Auckland CBD.\nOne effect of relocation for this least-cost service provider is cultural change: \u201cWe had a canteen in Onehunga where you could get lunch for six dollars. In Newmarket you\u2019re lucky if can get a coffee for four dollars,\u201d he says, ruefully. But it\u2019s Watercare\u2019s business \u2014 delivering clean, grade-A water to 1.2 million people \u2014 that is more likely to be keeping Foley awake than the product of the nearest Starbucks. \u201cIt sounds simple, but there are a lot of processes behind it,\u201d he says, suggesting a trip to the treatment plant to show me the sewage outfall and what he diplomatically describes as \u201cthe result\u201d of the organisation\u2019s efforts. I politely decline.\n\u201cYou turn on the tap and expect the water to come out and don\u2019t even think about where it goes,\u201d he says, clearly resigned to such public ignorance. \u201cBut if you think about what we do, we affect the whole of the Auckland region. If we get it really wrong, we affect approximately 1.2 million people within several hours, and that\u2019s always in the back of my mind \u2014 it\u2019s a 24-hour a day, 365-day a year operation.\u201d\nWhy pay for rain?\nThe lack of public appreciation must frustrate the suppliers of this essential service no end. Watercare\u2019s customers are local network operators and, as a 2005 AC Nielsen survey into the quality of its relationship with the public points out, the network operators have a limited understanding of the end user. Ask, for instance, if they think their water company is well-managed and you might find the odd ratepayer who doesn\u2019t want Auckland to take its water from the Waikato: \u201cI don\u2019t like the water quality and taste\u201d. Responses to a question about whether Watercare can be trusted include: \u201cWhy should we pay for something that comes out of the sky?\u201d Yet only about 12 per cent of respondents think their water company is not well-managed, and only 16 per cent say they do not consider it trustworthy. An impressive 77 per cent are satisfied with the water supply to their homes.\nA mature industry, then, with customers who might not value the service but who also tend to be uncritical of it until the product stops running. So I ask Foley whether he had anything akin to a \u2018Eureka moment\u2019 for Watercare\u2019s future IS strategy. He laughs. \u201cIt was more of a \u2018Jesus Christ what have I got myself into?\u2019 moment.\u201d Before Foley\u2019s appointment, the responsibility for IS delivery lay with an IT manager who now works for the organisation in another role. Foley says it\u2019s the first time he has ever been in a situation where an incumbent manager has had a new executive appointed over him. The situation contributed to a culture of doubt in the IS team. \u201cThe fear that everybody had when I first joined was, \u2018Will we all still have a job?\u2019 But why would I want to get rid of a team of people that has been here and who understands this organisation better than I did?\u201d\nGood point, and it\u2019s a pity more managers don\u2019t think that way. Foley not only kept his team, he added to it, and his previous work in similar utilities helped him to clarify a five-year strategy using the resources at his disposal. Within the first 10 months, Foley replaced Watercare\u2019s PC, DOS-based payroll and HR system with some application service provider-based software he outsourced to a third party. As Foley says understatedly, \u201cThat\u2019s one not to get wrong.\u201d\nThe big move\nTowards the end of 2006, Watercare relocated. But it was far from a straightforward office move: The continuity of Auckland\u2019s water supply depended on the new system being operational before the old one was taken off-stream. This required a joint effort between IS, the control systems team and operations to ensure continued availability. \u201cThe plan was that at 8am on 9 October 2006 we had to be fully operational in the new location. Along with the usual systems and infrastructure, we had to relocate operations. We have a 24-hour, 365-day-a-year control centre that can\u2019t go offline. We have a back-up, but we can\u2019t lose it.\u201d\nExecutives hear war stories about failed projects and over-budget IT implementations. \u201cThey\u2019re always conscious that IT projects have the potential to fail if there isn\u2019t a strong governance model applied to manage them,\u201d says Foley. While a large part of his job involves persuading senior colleagues that investment in technology is worthwhile, he also has to ensure that once the investment is made, it is sustained. \u201cYou can\u2019t just buy it once and that\u2019s it; you have to maintain that expenditure. It\u2019s a continual process of enhancement and update. A CIO has to maintain the repeat business.\u201d\nWithin the overarching relocation programme there were other projects that were critical to its overall delivery. For example, Foley outsourced server management to a third party. There was a migration of diverse PC operating systems to Microsoft XP. The IS team also implemented a new wide area network between the data centre, one of Watercare\u2019s main treatment sites and Nuffield Street. And a couple of months before the move Foley\u2019s team oversaw a changeover of the phones to voice over IP. \u201cWe brought in VoIP early because it was one less thing to think about when we got here. Where we could take the risk away, we did. We took away a lot of the physical desk phones, implemented the Vodafone Integrated Talk-zone solution and linked the mobile number to the DDIs.\u201d\nEveryone moved into Watercare\u2019s new premises on the Monday morning as though it was just another working day \u2014 the kind of dream transition that would turn many chief executives green with envy, and even when pressed on whether it really went so smoothly, Foley says there were just 20 service desk calls that first day. \u201cEverybody could log in, had email and a phone system. We were fully operational as of Saturday at 4pm. We were in there again on Monday morning, waiting for people. If there were any small issues we dealt with them then.\u201d\nThe success of the relocation may even have helped erase management perceptions that IS was a black hole. \u201cThere were quite a few shocked faces on the day we moved in \u2014 that at eight o\u2019clock in the morning they could already operate without any problems,\u201d says Foley. \u201cWe did what we said we were going to do in a structured process.\u201d\nGary Swift, Watercare\u2019s general manager finance, validates the exceptional work of Foley and the IS team.\n\u201cThese projects represented a \u2018sea change\u2019 in Watercare\u2019s computer and telephone systems; the most significant IS change since the company was established, in fact,\u201d says Swift.\n\u201cMike\u2019s background and experience meant he was ideally suited to lead this change. The execution of the projects \u2014 a combination of up-skilled existing IS staff, new staff and some specialist contractors \u2014 was planned to a very high degree. The fact that there were no problems on the day we moved into our new premises reflects Mike and his team\u2019s commitment, skills and planning. They can be justly very proud of their achievements.\u201d\nA multifaceted experience\nFoley says he comes from \u201ca typical development-into-management background\u201d. As well, Foley\u2019s multifaceted experiences throughout his career are all proving useful in his current role. His brother enjoys ribbing him about having worked in all five vices: \u201cGambling, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and as a consultant, according to him, I was a \u2018prostitute\u2019 selling to the highest paying client.\u201d\nHe worked in London on production planning systems; moved into telecommunications with what was then Mercury and is now Cable & Wireless; then brewing with Budweiser; before going into management consultancy, working in supply chain, customer management and plant production management. He relocated to New Zealand in December 1999 to run the Siebel practice for what was then Ernst & Young, before being headhunted by Deloitte to set up and run its customer relationship management practice. Deloitte eventually commandeered Foley\u2019s team to work for Telstra, consolidating its customer service solutions, and wanted to move it permanently to Melbourne. \u201cSurprisingly enough, none of my team wanted to live in Australia, so we went our separate ways.\u201d\nFoley joined Sky City as business solutions manager before being appointed CIO of Watercare two years ago. His consultancy engagements have given him a breadth of experience from a number of countries and industries that he can now translate to Watercare. \u201cSome of the best things I\u2019ve seen were not in the industry I was working in at the time. You borrow them. The best customer management process I ever reviewed was actually in a pizza company.\u201d Foley applied that knowledge to an engagement he had as a telecommunications consultant.\n\u201cMike is a no-nonsense type of guy,\u201d says a former colleague, Deloitte partner Keith N. McArley. \u201cHe has an enquiring mind and approaches all problem-solving in a structured and orderly manner.\u201d\nPlan for the worst, deliver the best\nThis skill set provides Foley an edge when dealing with a major part of his role as Watercare CIO \u2014 strategising for a disaster. The threat of avian flu last year caused Watercare to re-examine how it could securely supply water during a crisis. Plans also exist for many other types of civil disaster and large-scale emergency. \u201cYou have this differential between classic business systems, financials and asset management, and the control systems that monitor flow and pressure. If we lose those systems, then we have to fully man the plant 24x7, which has a huge impact on how we operate.\u201d\nOf the relationship between business and IS, two years into the role, Foley says it\u2019s now about business priorities. He mentions attending a recent CIO lunch, at which he noted Fonterra CIO Greg James\u2019s remark that there is no such thing as an ICT project. \u201cI firmly agree,\u201d says Foley. \u201cWe can facilitate, drive and manage it once we have chosen the right product and the capex signed off. But the business has to justify, select and review what they want and how they want it to work.\u201d\nFor Foley, service culture and \u201crepeat business\u201d are perennial themes: \u201cIt\u2019s all about them, not about IS.\u201d \u007f\nAbout Watercare\nWatercare Services is New Zealand\u2019s largest water and wastewater company. It supplies water to six retailers (Metrowater, North Shore City Council, Manukau Water, United Water, Rodney District Council and Waitakere City Council), which in turn supply it to Auckland consumers. The company supplies an average of 347,000 cubic metres of water daily, drawn from 12 sources: 10 dams, the Waikato River and Onehunga aquifer (a layer of rock through which groundwater flows to supply wells and springs). Watercare also operates a regional wastewater network for four of the region\u2019s councils. It treats on average 288,000 cubic metres of wastewater a day at Mangere\u2019s wastewater treatment plant. Watercare is owned by the city and district councils of Auckland, Manukau, North Shore, Waitakere, Papakura and Rodney. The owners appoint a shareholders\u2019 representative group, which in turn appoints Watercare\u2019s board of directors and determines objectives.\n\u00a9 Fairfax Business Group\n"}, {"score": 1686.3588, "uuid": "18627439-89c0-530b-a5ee-9142dcb2c4e8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1512wb-89-29188", "target_hostname": "globalcrisis.info", "target_uri": "http://globalcrisis.info/wateravailability.html", "page_rank": 1.3921805e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "<em>Water</em>: Biosaline agriculture, <em>water</em> from air, <em>rain</em> <em>water</em>, fog collectors", "snippet": "<em>for</em> <em>water</em> - clouds on <em>tap</em> Science in Africa.", "explanation": null, "document": "FAO main page. search for saline\nSaline Agriculture \"This is a set of interrelated projects aimed at improving agronomic production in saline environments.

Sounds familiar, doesn\u2019t it? At Hartbeespoort we know all about it. Water shortages have become commonplace in summer.\nEven right now there are townships in Madibeng where the residents have not had any water in their homes for more than two weeks. When we do get water from the taps we worry about drinking it because it looks and tastes like, well you know what. It\u2019s not always so but you never know, do you? Of course we know why, the population has doubled and the water works hasn\u2019t, so there just isn\u2019t enough to go round. When they try to push too much through, the process just doesn\u2019t cope and it is not treated properly.\nReservoirs run dry and all the muck in the bottom gets into the pipes and out of the taps. Of course they should be cleaned out regularly but they\u2019re not. Why is there muck, it\u2019s because the water wasn\u2019t cleaned properly in the first place. Do you want to know a secret? Do you know where they get the water from to treat and push up to the reservoir? Well they suck it out of the dam, near the dam wall just below the surface off the shoreline, where the algae and other unspeakables float in the water and get sucked right up.\nDo you know how they clean that water? Well I\u2019ve often seen it done and it\u2019s not what I would expect. The water is run for a short distance to let some of the sediment settle out, then fine air bubbles are released under it, which gets hold of most of the algae and lets it float to the top where it is scooped off. Then it\u2019s passed through a sand filter, like your pool, and when it\u2019s available, some chlorine is put in to kill off bacteria before it is pushed up to the reservoirs. That\u2019s about it, don\u2019t think that there are any fancy chemicals or systems that will filter out pharmaceuticals, chemicals or minerals that could harm you. Your kidneys will do that for you. What you do with the stuff is up to your system. If you\u2019re lucky it\u2019ll get rid of it, if not, don\u2019t ask.\nEver thought where the dam gets its water from in winter? It all comes down the Crocodile River, night and day, summer or winter. No rain in winter, you say, that\u2019s right, so where from? The sewage works of Joburg of course, silly. Now that I\u2019ve got your attention, where does the Sewage works get the water from, why from the kind people in Joburg, where it\u2019s been through their kidneys already. They\u2019re OK, they get it from the Lesotho Mountains, nice and clean, most of the time.\nSo what to do? Take care of yourselves, if you can\u2019t be sure of the water from the tap, treat it before you drink it. In my opinion use one of these Reverse Osmoses, RO, gadgets with the built in filters that\u2019ll take out the obvious muck, taste and smell, then pushes it through a very fine membrane and you\u2019ll get the best water you can get.\nOh I know the stories about, \u201cIt\u2019s not good to remove all the minerals\u201d.\nWell I would rather start with clear and clean water and add whatever minerals I choose to add to my diet, than rely on chance and drink whatever toxic poisons are collected on the way through all the industrial waste and not to forget all that AMD, acid mine drainage, everyone is talking about.\nThey may get it right one day but until then? Better to be safe than sorry. And what do we know about all that expensive bottled water everyone is pushing? Is it really fit to drink? A fancy label doesn\u2019t make it so.\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 1614.0554, "uuid": "8f9cdaca-6dcf-578c-88bc-ba55d8cc913a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-27-03026", "target_hostname": "enenews.com", "target_uri": "http://enenews.com/iodine-131-detected-recent-minamisoma-tap-water-lab-report", "page_rank": 1.3642574e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Iodine-131 detected in recent Minamisoma <em>tap</em> <em>water</em> (LAB REPORT)", "snippet": "Perhaps it <em>is</em> time <em>for</em> the Japanese Exodus to save the race.

You might not be able to judge the value of water by its cost but it is fundamental for food, health, industry and wildlife and we shouldn't take it for granted.\nWe all waste water but we are becoming more and more aware of how we can make small changes to our habits to help save water, not by going without but by cutting out waste and unnecessary use.\nHere are some of our ideas for using water wisely...\n...in the home\nA running tap uses about 6 litres a minute\nDon't leave the tap running when brushing your teeth.\nUse a bowl for washing vegetables and dishes and pour any left over water onto houseplants.\nPut a jug or bottle of tap water in the fridge so that you have cold water available whenever you want it without having to run the tap first.\nDishwashers and washing machines\nA common misconception is that washing up by hand always uses less water than a dishwasher. New energy efficient dishwashers are also water efficient, and if you wait until you have a full load it can often use less water than washing by hand. If you do wash by hand, save dishes to wash in one go and rinse them off in a bowl and not under running water.\nIf your washing machine or dishwasher is coming to the end of its life, there are lots of water-efficient options that you could look at. To help you, | Waterwise (an independent organisation dedicated to reducing water wastage) has ranked all new UK dishwashers and washing machines according to water efficiency. These rankings are updated in July each year.\nWater meters\nA water meter measures the amount of water you use. This means you only pay for what you use (in addition to the fixed charge) so it is seen as the fairest way to pay for water. If you are not on a metered supply, you will be charged based on the size of your property. So, if you are one person, or a small family, in a large house, you would probably save money if you switch to a meter. On the other hand, if you are a large family in a small house, you might end up spending more money if you switch to a meter.\nAll homes built since 1991 have had a water meter installed as standard and all water companies have the power to install a meter when a customer changes address but there are still lots of properties which are unmetered. Currently, only 28% of homes in England and Wales have meters. Research shows that metered homes use about 10% less water than non-metered homes and the government has recently consulted on proposals to introduce a programme of compulsory metering in the South East.\nIf you decide to switch to a water meter, your water company will install a water meter free of charge where practical and in most cases you will be given the option to revert back to a non-metered supply if you give notice within 12 months of installation.\nFor further information, | contact your water company .\n...in the garden\nFor most of the year, water used outside accounts for very little of the total amount used by domestic customers. But during the summer months we can use up to half of all our water in the garden. Conserving water in the garden doesn't mean wilting plants. Again, it's the little things that can make a big difference.\nHere are our tips for a flourishing waterwise garden:\nWatering your garden\nIf you haven't got one yet, get a water butt. And if you've already got one, why not get another one? Plants love rainwater even more than tap water and a standard water butt can collect 500 litres of it a year!\nA typical garden sprinkler can use up to 1000 litres of water an hour - the same amount that a family of 4 uses in a whole day! And much of this water is wasted. When the water is thrown high into the air, some of it evaporates before your plants get a chance to drink it!\nMake sure that you do your weeding - weeds leave less water for your flowers and vegetables.\nAvoid watering plants little and often as this will encourage shallow rooting - occasional but thorough watering will make plants more resilient to periods of drought and remember to water plants early in the morning or evening when less water will evaporate. Not only will you save water and money, your plants will thank you for it too!\nWater retaining gel for pots and hanging baskets considerably reduces the need to water. The gel absorbs up to 400 times its own weight in water and releases it throughout the season so your flowers never go thirsty.\nMulch, mulch, mulch - Use gravels, barks, manures, straw, tree leaves or grass cuttings to prevent water from evaporating.\nLeave the lawn alone. Lawns can survive without water if the grass is not cut too short. If the grass turns brown during a dry period it will recover really quickly after a little rain.\nDrought-resistant plants\nLook out for drought-resistant plants - The | Royal Horticultural Society has a list of plants that thrive in dry conditions and suggestions on equipment and techniques for maintaining your thirst-free garden.\nHerbs often prefer dry soil and are generally more aromatic as a result especially rosemary, sage and thyme.\nThere are also plenty of vegetables which an cope with little water. Try parsnips, beetroot, onions, carrots and asparagus.

But water would have been one important reason, says archaeologist Steven Mithen. When Neolithic men and women arrived 11,500 years ago, things were very different: the climate was cooler and wetter; the landscape was covered in vegetation including wild figs, legumes and cereals, and there would have been wild goats and ibex for meat.\nInitially WF16, as it's now called, would have been a seasonal camp. But Mithen, professor of early prehistory at the University of Reading, and his fellow archaeologist Bill Finlayson believe that, gradually, people stayed longer. Sifting evidence from so long ago, the archaeologists can't be sure, but remains of food from different seasons and the scale of 'rubbish' piles suggest that about 10,000 years ago the inhabitants stopped moving altogether. If they are right, it would make this one of the oldest sites ever found where humans made a permanent settlement, learned to farm, and changed the course of human civilisation. But the tiny community drawn to water, which attracted successive waves of settlements, would eventually all but destroy the resource which made life possible. It is a pattern that's been repeated for millennia, around the world, and it now threatens us on a global scale.\nFirst people cut trees for shelter and fuel, until rains swept away the soil instead of seeping into shallow aquifers, and the springs dried up. At least as long ago as the Bronze Age, farmers began mankind's obsession with diverting water for crops to feed the growing population. Meanwhile, the moist, cool climate which encouraged the first settlement was naturally becoming drier and hotter.\nAt least twice, historians believe, Wadi Faynan was abandoned. The first time possibly because of a sharp change in the climate, and later because it became too polluted. Today, Bedouin who survive in the valley have laid pipes down the dry stream bed to suck what is left of the spring in order to irrigate fields of tomatoes they have scratched out of the dry soil. But it's getting harder. According to local water lore, good rains now come in less than every other year.\nThe farmers in Wadi Faynan are not alone. Like communities around the world, they are paying the price for thousands of years of exploitation of our environment. Already, 1bn people do not have enough clean water to drink, and at least 2bn cannot rely on adequate water to drink, clean and eat - let alone have enough left for nature. Lack of water is blamed for many of the world's most distressing crises: millions of deaths each year from disease and malnutrition, chronic hunger, keeping children away from schools which offer hope of a better life. Mostly it is the poor who suffer, but increasingly rich nations are struggling, too. Australia has endured so many dry years that a leading climatologist has said it's time to stop saying 'gripped by drought' and accept that the lack of rain is permanent.\nIn parts of the US supplies are so vulnerable that last autumn the Red Cross delivered water parcels to the town of Orme in Tennessee. 'I thought, \"That can't be the Red Cross. We're Americans!\"' resident Susan Anderson told a reporter. In California, some farmers abandoned their crops this year as Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared the first state-wide drought for 17 years. Meanwhile Barcelona was so desperate that it began importing tankers of water from cities along the coast. Even in the notoriously wet UK, water has become such a problem in the crowded southeast that one company plans to build a desalination plant, the sort of desperate measure associated with oil-rich desert states.\nThe Stockholm International Water Institute talks about 'an acute and devastating humanitarian crisis'; the founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, warns of a 'perfect storm'; Ban Ki-Moon, the United Nations Secretary General, has raised the spectre of 'water wars'. And, as the population keeps growing and getting richer, and global warming changes the climate, experts are warning that unless something is done, billions more will suffer lack of water - precipitating hunger, disease, migration and ultimately conflict. In a bid to avert this catastrophe, politicians, economists and engineers are pressing for dramatic changes to the way water is managed, from tree planting and simple storage wells, to multibillion dollar schemes to replumb the planet with dams and pipes, or manufacture freshwater from sewers and the sea.\nThe water crisis is an expression of the environmental catastrophe of human over-exploitation. This is the age the Nobel prize-winning chemist Paul Crutzen has called 'the Anthropocene', because the natural system has been so fundamentally altered by human activity. And it all began when people settled down and began to chop wood and farm. 'The start of sedentary communities is the start of the need to manage fresh water supplies,' says Steven Mithen. 'This is a starting point for our whole modern dilemma. It's gone from the concerns of individual settlements, to cities, to nations, and it's now a global issue.'\nThere is, in theory, plenty of water on the earth to sustain its 6.5bn people. More than 97 per cent of all the water on the planet is salt water, and most of the freshwater is locked up in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. But that still leaves 10m cubic kilometres (km3) of usable water, circulating in cycles of evaporation and precipitation between the atmosphere and earth, where it appears in underground aquifers, lakes and rivers, glaciers, snowpacks, wetlands, permafrost and soil. Each km3 is equivalent to 1,000bn litres, or 1bn tonnes, of water - about the remaining annual flow of the River Nile.\nOn the other side of the equation, the UN says individuals need five litres of water a day simply to survive in a moderate climate, and at least 50 litres a day for drinking and cooking, bathing and sanitation. Industry accounts for about double the average domestic use. But agriculture needs much, much more - in fact, 90 per cent of all water used by humans. The water is not 'lost' from earth, but over-abstraction by irrigators means it is often moved from where it is needed. Tony Allan, of King's College London, estimates that, together, 6.5bn people need 8,000km3 of water each year - a fraction of what is theoretically available. 'There's certainly enough water for every person on the planet, but too often it's in the wrong places at the wrong times in the wrong amounts,' says Marq de Villiers, author of the 2001 book Water Wars\nThree hours north of Wadi Faynan is the much greener Wadi Esseir, where Salah Al-Mherat and his family are one of millions of households in Jordan who feel the daily effects of inhabiting one of the driest countries on earth. Once a week, Al-Mherat gets water from the local irrigation co-operative for his fig, lemon, olive and grenadine trees and vegetables. For the rest he relies on rain. But since the Nineties the springs have been drying, sapped by demand from the nearby capital, Amman, and rain has been declining.\nOn a hot morning in April, Al-Mherat comes in from picking petits-pois, hitches up his smock and settles on to a pile of cushions. Fidgeting with a pot of scented tea he explains that the crops now barely cover their costs; he has to work as a security guard to supplement his income. 'When I started it was very good compared to now,' he says. 'The first impact was that the size of the irrigated area became reduced. People also changed what they irrigated, so the water now goes mainly to the trees - some farmers stopped completely from doing vegetables.' Al-Mherat says he keeps hoping things will improve, because he will pass the land to his sons. 'It's my life,' he says. 'But even if I'm positive, the reality is it's like the wish of the devil to go to paradise.'\nGlobal population, economic development and a growing appetite for meat, dairy and fish protein have raised human water demand sixfold in 50 years. Meanwhile, supplies have been diminished in several ways: an estimated 845,000 dams block most of the world's rivers, depriving downstream communities of water and sediment, and increasing evaporation; up to half of water is lost in leakage; another 1bn people simply have no proper infrastructure; and the water left is often polluted by chemicals and heavy metals from farms and industry, blamed by the UN for poisoning more than 100m people. And still the rains are getting less reliable in many areas.\nUnderlying these problems is a paradox. Because water, and the movement of water, is essential for life, and central to many religions, it is traditionally regarded as a 'common' good. But no individuals are responsible for it. From Wadi Esseir to the arid American Midwest, farmers either do not pay for water or pay a fraction of what homeowners pay, so they have less incentive to conserve it and might deprive suppliers of funds to improve infrastructure.\nThe UN defines 'water scarcity' as fewer than 1,000m3 of renewable clean water for each person every year to drink, clean, grow food and run industry. By this measure half the world's population lives in countries suffering water scarcity. Jordan is one of the most water-scarce countries on earth, averaging just 160m3 of renewable water per person per year.\nThe result is that it is not just farmers who are rationed. The Al-Mherat family, like the rest of greater Amman, only get water to their house one day a week. A city of more than 2m people runs to the rhythm of 'water day', says Dr Khadija Darmame, who is part of a \u00a31.25m project organised by Mithen and sponsored by Britain's Leverhulme Trust to study links between 'water, life and civilisation' in Jordan, from the earliest settlements to modern day.\nPoor supplies and stagnant tanks occasionally lead to infections. But for most, the problem is drudgery. 'The first thing is to do the maximum laundry and then clean the house,' says Darmame. Children and men take a shower, 'and the last thing is for the women to take a shower, and then you need a few hours to fill the tanks,' stacked on every roof.\nFor millions of others, bad supplies are a question of life and death. Lack of clean drinking water and sanitation are largely blamed for the death of 11m children under five each year from disease and malnutrition; for nearly 1bn people who are chronically hungry; for 2bn who suffer what the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization calls 'food insecurity', because they do not have adequate food and nutrition for an 'active and healthy life'; and for keeping more than 60m girls out of school. These people then get caught in a water and poverty trap: two-thirds of the people who lack enough water for even the most basic needs live on less than $2 a day. 'Variability of water availability is strongly and negatively related to per capita income,' says Professor Jeffrey Sachs, author of Common Wealth: Economics For a Crowded Planet, and a special adviser to the UN Secretary General. Poor health, lack of education and hunger make it hard to escape.\nUltimately, lack of water is seen as a threat to peace. From genocide in Darfur to rows between states in India and the US, Ban Ki-Moon is one of several global leaders who have warned of further legal and armed disputes over water. Intuitively it is obvious people will fight over their most precious resource, but so far few conflicts have broken out. The idea of 'water wars' seized the public imagination in 2001 when Marq de Villiers's book of that name was published in the UK, but the author disagreed with the publisher's choice of title. De Villiers agrees that water is often an underlying cause of tension, but has only identified one water 'war', between Egypt and Sudan. 'You cannot do without water, so when shortages pinch, states do co-operate and compromise,' he says. But if half the world's population lives in water-stressed countries, how do so many, from the breadbaskets of Asia to the sprawling cities in the arid American west, keep watering fields and running taps?\nOne reason is that water flows uphill to money, as the saying goes. Thus people in oil-rich Kuwait enjoy expensive desalination, while Palestinians suffer daily hardship; tourists in Amman can turn on the tap at any time, while those in the poorest areas of the city have access to water for a few hours each week. As Tony Allan says: 'Water shortages don't pose serious problems to gardeners in Hampshire or California homeowners with pools to fill.'\nAnother answer to the conundrum was identified by Allan, who in the Sixties became curious about why Middle Eastern countries without abundant water supplies were not suffering from a more obvious water crisis. The answer, he realised, was trade: by buying food, water-poor societies were 'buying' what he dubbed 'virtual water'. They were helped by farmers dumping grain into the world market once subsidies created massive over-supply. 'This potential tragedy was motoring on and hit the calm waters of the Americans and Europeans providing food [for the world market] at half cost, and the water contained in that food [was water] they didn't have to find.'\nThe other answer is that communities around the world have been forced to tap rivers and lakes and aquifers, sometimes millions of years old, far beyond the limit at which they can replenish themselves. Above ground, lakes are shrinking and rivers are being reduced to pathetic flows, or drying up altogether. Below ground, a largely invisible crisis is unfolding as millions of wells have been sunk into aquifers - 4m in Bangladesh alone. Many aquifers are replenishable, but not all, and many that can be recharged don't get enough rain to match demand. Sometimes the empty cavities simply collapse, putting them beyond use forever. In his recent book, Plan B 3.0, Lester Brown catalogues the results. In the breadbaskets of China, India, the US, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Israel and Mexico, water tables are falling, sometimes by many metres a year. Pumps are being drilled a kilometre or more to find water, thousands more wells have dried up altogether and agricultural yields are shrinking. These countries contain more than half the world's people and produce most of its grain, warns Brown. Meanwhile, almost forgotten amid the human suffering are the terrible consequences for the natural world: freshwater fish populations fell by half between 1970 and 2000, says the UN.\nAll these dams and irrigation channels and pumps and pipes allow billions of people to run up a gigantic global water overdraft. What worries experts is that there is no sign of humans withdrawing less water. Two years ago, the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) published a report by 700 experts warning that one in three people were 'enduring one form or another of water scarcity'. 'Scarcity for me is when women work hard to get water, [or] you want to allocate more but can't,' says David Molden, deputy director of the Sri Lanka-based organisation.\nMolden warns that the situation is becoming 'a little bit more critical', because of continuing rising demand for food, the recent boom in biofuels and climate change. To that can also be added another, poignant 'demand': the long-overdue realisation that nature also needs water, which in Europe and other countries has led to laws to ensure 'minimum environmental flows' remain in place.\nFor food alone, the World Bank estimates that demand for water will rise 50 per cent by 2030, and the IWMI fears it could nearly double by 2050. Whether these crops require rain or irrigation depends on where they are grown, and how much rain there is.\nLike a great river fed by many tributaries, water is a conduit for the various effects of global warming: more variable rainfall, more floods, more droughts, the melting of glaciers on which 1bn people depend for summer river flows, and rising sea levels, threatening to inundate not just coastal communities but also their freshwater aquifers, river deltas and wetlands. From the headline figures, climate change should be good news. Crudely, scientists estimate for every 1C rise in the average global temperature, precipitation will increase one per cent, as warmer air absorbs more moisture. The world's total volume would not change, but it would be recycled more quickly, affecting the majority of the world's agriculture which depends on the volume and timing of rainfall.\nBalancing all these impacts, Nigel Arnell, director of Reading University's Walker Institute for Climate Change, calculates that the number of people living in water basins exposed to water stress will rise from 1.4bn to 2.9-3.3bn by 2025 and to 3.4-5.6bn by 2055. In fact, the greatest impact in Arnell's modelling is from rising populations, particularly in China and India, and, globally, climate change is actually reducing exposure to shortages. This may be good news for some, but masks huge disruption, as some regions fear too much water, while hundreds of millions of people start to run out.\nIt is impossible to attribute one farm's difficulties or one year's rainfall to climate change. But if climate is the statistics of weather, then the rain gauge this year on the farm of Sameeh Al-Nuimat, northwest of Amman, is typical of what the experts forecast. Al-Nuimat had noticed a gradual decline in rainfall for years, but this year it dropped off steeply and there was no rain at all in March, a critical time for summer crops. 'My father told me he'd never seen such a year,' he says.\nSuch dramatic events have injected urgency into discussions about Jordan's precarious water supplies, says Al-Nuimat, who is also an irrigation engineer at the Ministry of Agriculture. 'Before, when water was available, no one worried about it. But now there's interest - every night people speaking, every night debating, at every level, from the farmer to the planner to the politician. As a farmer I'd like to see drought-resistant crops; from a civil engineering point of view we should look for mega projects; and, if you're thinking about global planning, there should be acceptance of people moving from water-scarce regions to where water is available.'\nAround the world the same debates are under way. Rich countries can make significant gains from domestic efficiency, but most of the world's population does not have power showers and swimming pools, or waste great quantities of food. Instead the main focus is on reducing water in agriculture, through more efficient irrigation, by engineering seeds to grow in more arid and salty conditions, and even shifting crops. 'If the world were my farm, I'd grow things in different places,' says David Molden. But even benign-sounding conservation is often unpopular. There is widespread resistance to raising prices for water (or energy for pumping) to increase efficiency, suspicion of genetic modification, and a reluctance among farmers to abandon water-hungry but lucrative crops when they are struggling to feed their family. 'It's a socioeconomic dilemma,' says Al-Nuimat. 'You can't stop now: it's the source of their life.'\nFaced with public apathy and even resistance, responses have tended to focus on increasing supply. For decades the scale of ambition has been like a game of global engineering one-upmanship: rivers have been diverted across countries, pumps sunk kilometres into fossil aquifers, and bigger plants commissioned to recycle or desalinate water. And there is no sign of a let-up. As shortages become more desperate and costs and energy use fall, Global Water Intelligence forecasts that desalination capacity will more than double by 2015, and the potential to increase wastewater recycling is enormous, being only 2 per cent of volume. But huge costs, environmental concerns and public distaste for drinking their 'waste' has forced many communities to reconsider simpler, traditional methods, too. Some of the ideas the earliest farmers would have recognised: tree replanting, ripping out thirsty non-native plants, stone walls to hold back erosion, and rain harvesting with simple ponds and tanks. Some have even urged a return to more vegetarian diets, which at their extreme demand only half the water of a typical American meat-eater's. This is, according to Lord Haskins, the former chairman of Britain's Northern Foods group and a government adviser, 'the most virtuous and responsible step of all'.\nAnd when all options are exhausted at home, countries have another option: to import water in food and even industrial goods. Political meddling with subsidies makes trade a controversial 'solution', but by favouring regions with a 'competitive advantage' in water it can work. Globally the IWMI estimates irrigation demand would be 11 per cent higher without trade, and quotes a projection that imports can cut future irrigation by another 19-38 per cent by 2025. Saudi Arabia has gone further than most, announcing in February that it would stop all wheat production in a few years, though other countries might now be deterred by higher food prices.\nUltimately governments are being forced down several paths at once: to raise prices to reflect the true value of water to humans and the environment, invest in technology to improve efficiency and supplies, engage in more trade, and make peace with neighbours that can hold up incoming water or food. These will only be possible, though, if people can be lifted out of poverty, to afford higher prices, capital spending and imports. 'When you diversify your economy you solve your problems,' says Allan. Looking back at the history of mankind's struggle for enough water, experience suggests the initiative which enabled humans to settle, farm and dominate the planet will provide many solutions. But sometimes we might have to accept defeat. 'On the one hand you can see this amazing technological ingenuity of humans, which throughout prehistory and history continually invented new ways to manage water supply,' says Mithen. 'On the other, the story of the past tells us that sometimes, however brilliant your technological inventions, they are just not good enough, and you get periods of abandonment of landscapes. We have got to be prepared to invest in technology, but also to recognise in some parts of the world there are going to be areas where we're going to have to say \"enough's enough\".' A person uses about 50 litres of water a day; industry accounts for double that. But agriculture needs much more - in fact, 90 per cent of all water used by humans.\n"}, {"score": 1571.2429, "uuid": "a2e51052-a1af-52b3-a0c3-ea286daac208", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0607wb-37-18160", "target_hostname": "www.waltonsun.com", "target_uri": "http://www.waltonsun.com/opinion/gutters-3540-make-downspouts.html", "page_rank": 1.2156337e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "EARTH TALK: Collecting <em>rain</em> <em>water</em> from your gutters&#x27; downspouts <em>is</em> a no-brainer", "snippet": "<em>Plants</em> and grass actually do <em>better</em> when fed rainwater instead of <em>tap</em> <em>water</em>, which <em>is</em> usually treated with softeners that actually inhibit <em>plant</em> growth.

It suffers change into as many natures as are the different places through which it passes. And as the mirror changes with the colour of its subject, so it alters with the nature of the place, becoming noisome, laxative, astringent, sulfurous, salty, incarnadined, mournful, raging, angry, red, yellow, green, black, blue, greasy, fat or slim. Sometimes it starts a conflagration, sometimes it extinguishes one; is warm and is cold, carries away or sets down, hollows out or builds up, tears or establishes, fills or empties, raises itself or burrows down, speeds or is still; is the cause at times of life or death, or increase or privation, nourishes at times and at others does the contrary; at times has a tang, at times is without savor, sometimes submerging the valleys with great floods.

Out of this fire, water is born. Quaint Victorian chemistry gives us an image of one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms in a fixed molecule that bounces around from place to place.

Set a timer, and keep the shower hot for every family\nmember. Shortening your showers by five minutes can mean a savings of 20 to 40 gallons of water. Installing a\nlow flow showerhead with a shut-off valve can save you even more. Use the shower calculator to see what imapct shorter showers camn make for your household.\nIn the shower, a lot of water can be wasted while soaping up. Wet down; turn off the water, soap up and the turn the water on for rinsing.\nTry washing both of your youngsters in the same tub of water if they are not too dirty. This saves water and can be fun for the kids. Re-use bath water for plants and for heavy cleaning jobs.\nWhen brushing your teeth, only turn the water on to wet the brush. Make sure to turn it off when brushing. Fill a glass to rinse your mouth and wash the brush. This can mean the difference between using a pint of water and wasting several gallons.\nMake sure you have an aerator on all sink faucets.\nA well-maintained toilet can mean big water savings. Usually, a 100-gallon a day toilet leak is not very noticeable. Use a few drops of food coloring or toilet tablets in the tank and wait for 15 minutes. If the toilet is leaking, the water in the bowl will change color. A bad leak can send thousands of gallons silently down the drain. Silently, that is, until you receive your water bill.\nUse a wastebasket for disposing facial tissues. Saving one flush is worth five to seven gallons of water in a standard toilet.\nDO NOT use a brick in your toilet tank. It may disintegrate and cause problems in your water lines. Instead, consider installing a low-flow toilet that uses 1.6 or 1.28 gallons per flush. Visit our toilet rebate section for details.\nreturn to top\nKitchen\nThe kitchen is an excellent place for conservation. Be especially conscious of running water and develop the habit of shutting off the tap whenever possible.\nBoiling requires very little water if you use a tight fitting lid to conserve moisture. By steaming you can save all the vitamins and minerals, too. But if you do boil vegetables, save the water for soups and sauces... they will be tastier and more nutritious.\nRemove ice cubes from the freezer a few minutes before you need the ice. The cubes will loosen at room temperature and will save several quarts of water if they are not run under the tap. Don't quick-thaw meats under the faucet either.\nBefore scrubbing your pots and pans, wash them first. Instead of running water continuously, fill wash and rinse basins with water. Use a minimum amount of detergent. Add vinegar (1/4 to 1/2 cup) to dishwater to prevent grease from clinging to dishes, pots and pans.\nWhen using the dishwasher, make sure it is fully loaded. It also helps to use a water saving model. Some dishwashers use up to 25 gallons of water a cycle while newer models may use only 10 gallons. If you are buying a new dishwasher, shop around to find the machines that use less water per cycle and are more efficient.\nRepair leaks. Inspect all connections to be sure they're tight and dry.\nMany automatic dishwashers do not require rinsing dishes before loading the machine, but if yours does, pond water in the sink and soak them.\nSave water by accumulating food cuttings in the drain area and by only switching on the garbage disposal when it is full. Using left over wash water when you run the disposal will save more of our drinking water.\nEach time you need water to wash dishes, scrub vegetables, wash your face, shave, hand-wash clothes, and many other cleaning jobs, put the stopper in the sink and pond the water you need rather than letting it run down the drain. This habit alone will save as much as five gallons a minute!\nreturn to top\nHousehold Cleaning\nUse a pail or basin instead of running water. Use a sponge-mop instead of a string-mop. It uses less water for mopping and takes less water to keep the mop clean.\nPresoak grills, oven parts, etc., overnight. Wash with an abrasive scrub brush or pad and use plenty of elbow grease to minimize water use.\nCheck faucets and hose connections for leaks. Repair or replace when necessary. Inspect pipes for pinhole leaks, leaking joints, etc.\nreturn to top\nLaundry\nMore than 10% of all water used in the home is used in the washing machine, so even a small investment of time and money can pay off in the long run. Washing machines use 30-55 gallons per load. Use the load selector to match the water level to size of the load. If there is no selector, wash only full loads. Presoak heavily soiled items and always use a minimum amount of detergent.\nRe-use water. For many laundry and household cleaning jobs, a low-sudsing, biodegradable detergent will result in cleaner rinse water, which can be used again.\nreturn to top\nWater Treatment Devices\nAlthough Marietta's public water is safe and meets all State and Federal Health Standards, some residents have installed water softeners and drinking water filters at their homes and businesses. The amount of water that water softeners and reverse osmosis systems use in their normal operations is a concern as our area has so little water to spare.\nIf you own or rent a water softener or R/O system, there are several things you can do to minimize the amount of water used in their operation.\nContact your dealer or the manufacturer to arrange for the installation of an automatic shut-off valve that will reduce the amount of water used in the production of reverse osmosis drinking water.\nConsider alternatives to your choice of water treatment equipment. Newer equipment may be more water efficient.\nConsider whether these devices are needed at your home.\nCheck Before You Travel...\nWhen leaving on vacation, it is a good idea to shut-off the water at the main outside valve. While you are away, an undetected leak could result in great waste, possible damage, and an expensive water bill. Check outside water faucets to see that they are turned off completely.\n"}, {"score": 1560.9492, "uuid": "20dfe788-3752-52d8-8d17-e1e6a4a80fa2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1800wb-25-06229", "target_hostname": "waterfortheages.org", "target_uri": "http://waterfortheages.org/tag/international-water/page/3/", "page_rank": 1.173497e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "international <em>water</em> | <em>Water</em> <em>for</em> the Ages | Page 3", "snippet": "s campaign to provide clean drinking <em>water</em> to children in developing countries, sounds <em>better</em> <em>than</em> consumerism to me!", "explanation": null, "document": "Bottlemania: How Water Went on Sale and Why We Bought\u00a0It\nA new book,\u00a0Bottlemania by\u00a0Elizabeth\u00a0Royt,\u00a0will\u00a0focus\u00a0on the complications of bottled water in today\u2019s society.\u00a0It will be available on May 13, 2008.

Calcium causes most of the visible water problems you see on sinks, tubs and glasses. Hard water is generally not harmful.\nThe severity of water hardness is measured by mineral grains per gallon (GPG). Rain water is naturally soft or 0 grains. Anything over 3.5 GPG is considered hard\nIs softened water safe to drink?\nAccording to Mayo Clinic... \"the amount of sodium a water softener adds to tap water depends on the \"hardness\" of the water. The best way to decrease your sodium intake is by cutting back on table salt and processed foods. But the water from your tap also may add a significant amount of sodium to your diet.\"\nPDM normally connects your new softener to your hot water supply. That way you reduce the amount of softened water needed. You then can use unsoftened cold water for drinking, cooking and watering plants.\nHow much salt to add?\nCheck your storage tank once a month. Keep the salt level at least half-full at all times for a good supply of soft water. Remember, just because the tank is full of salt doesn't mean your water will be more salty. The tank is simply for salt storage.\nWhich softener salt should I use and can I mix different types of water softener salts?\nRock salt has a lot of matter that is not water-soluble meaning the softening reservoirs have to be cleaned more often. Rock salt is cheaper than evaporated salt and solar salt, but you'll have more maintenance to do.\nSolar salt contains a bit more water-insoluble matter than evaporated salt. If salt usage is low, you could change from one product to another.\nIf salt usage is high, insoluble salts will build up faster when using solar salt. Evaporated salt requires less maintenance.\nWhat is a water softener salt bridge?\nA hard crust of salt can form between the water and the salt. Humidity or the wrong salt can cause the salt bridge. Salt won\u2019t dissolve in the water to make brine. Without brine, the resin bed does not regenerate and you will have hard water.\nSolution: If your salt/brine tank is full of salt, it is hard to know if you have a salt bridge. Salt may be loose on top, but the salt bridge is hiding below. Take a broom handle, and push it straight down into the salt. If a hard object is felt, you probably hit a salt bridge. Carefully push broom handle into the bridge in several places to break it.\nDO NOTE USE SHARP OR POINTED TOOL \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you could puncture your tank and cause leak.\nWe deliver!\nPDM will deliver water softener salt and load the salt into your softener for one price.\nNo more lugging heavy bags of salt.\nPDM will even perform an operation check of your water softener during each visit.\nCall Joyce for more water softener salt help.\nHow does a water softener remove hard water?\nSimply put, in a water softener, hard water calcium and magnesium minerals change form by soaking up the salt's sodium.\nA water softener collects hardness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them down the drain. The result is no more ring around the tub and spotted glasses, softer skin, cleaner looking fabrics and a whole lot more.\nOver time water mineral scale can form to clog your pipes, restrict water flow and water pressure can be reduced. Water softener can help remove hard water scale.\nHave rusty water problem?\n"}, {"score": 1546.8977, "uuid": "800a3e99-d52c-5ee5-9ea8-af52be1e37ac", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1716wb-87-02717", "target_hostname": "www.greenhousetrust.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.greenhousetrust.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87:saving-water&catid=46:information-and-briefings-general&Itemid=90", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "Saving <em>Water</em>", "snippet": "<em>Water</em> <em>is</em> life.

Nearly three quarters of the surface of the planet is covered by water and planet earth might be better described as planet water. We waste and contaminate it at our peril.\nWe take fresh water very much for granted. Turn on the tap - and there it is. It is easy to forget how precious water is.

As climate change accelerates, rainfall patterns will alter and, in some areas, water supplies will become depleted. Building more reservoirs and transporting water causes environmental problems such as loss of habitats and damage to fragile eco-systems. If we use water more sensibly we can significantly alter the situation.\nAs well as reducing the volume of water that we use, we must also ensure that water pollution is tackled effectively. This will protect both our health and the wider environment.\n2.4 billion people on our planet do not have access to safe water and 2 billion lack adequate sanitation or water to grow crops. The impacts of climate change are likely to affect the people who have the least responsibility for carbon emissions, and very little capacity to respond to the major droughts, floods and increasing climatic disruption.\n1. A shower or a bath?\nA five-minute shower consumes approximately thirty-five litres of water, half the amount of water - and energy - that a full bath takes. And five minutes is a long time in the shower! Add a fine spray attachment to your shower so that you use even less water. If you have a bath, make sure you re-use the water. Pre-soak washing, water the garden with the water, or use it to wash the floor or windows.\n2. Repair all leaks and drips immediately, install a low-flush toilet and ensure that your water company is maintaining adequate standards and not wasting water\nOften, all that a dripping tap needs is the washer replaced - yet this simple step can stop up to 5 litres of water leaking away each day. Flushing the loo accounts for over a third of our water use. Installing a low-flush toilet means that you have a choice of two flushes - a long one or a short one - and this greatly reduces the amount of water used. If you cannot have one of these installed, try carefully putting an insoluble object in the cistern to reduce the amount of water used in each flush. Many of the water companies provide suitable bottles and bags.\nIn some areas of the United Kingdom, more than a third of our water supply is being lost through leaky pipes. Find out from OFWAT what your water company's record is. If it's bad, write and insist they invest more of their profits in water conservation. Water companies are legally obliged to state when levels of contaminants in tap-water breach European Community limits. By reporting all such infringements, you can encourage prosecution of offenders and force an improvement in the quality of tap water (contact OFWAT for details).\nOFWAT.

You will often find that other share-holders will have similar concerns.\n3. Make the most of rainy days by collecting rain-water\nInvest in a rainwater collection system to flush your toilets, you will substantially reduce the volume of treated water used.\nGreen Shop - Mail order - rain/grey-water equipment - Bisley, Stroud, Gloucester, GL6 7BX.

Drink tap water not bottled water.\nWater the garden with your bath water and washing up water (let it cool and make sure your detergents are eco-friendly). You'll be surprised at how much running water is wasted. Fill up a mug with water and use it to clean your teeth, rather than leave the tap running.\nThe Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management has pointed out the substantial fuel costs, and thousands of tonnes of harmful emissions involved in transferring over 22 million tonnes of bottled liquid from country to country every year. In contrast, tap water is provided by a comparatively efficient infrastructure of underground pipes and plumbing. It is insane to pay to throw away a plastic bottle when tap water is often of better quality.\n5. Don't contribute to water pollution\nTry out some detergent-free \u2018eco-balls' and natural soap pods in your washing machine. Check loo cleaners and household products for ingredients that might damage water organisms. If you're not sure what it is or what it does, and the manufacturer won't give you clear answers - don't use it!\nNatural Collection - Mail order - detergents, nappies and green goods -\nEco House, Monmouth Place, Bath, BA1 2DQ.

Give up or eat meat as a real treat\nIt takes 500 litres of water to produce 1kg of potatoes, 900 litres per kg of wheat, 3,500 litres per kg of digestible chicken flesh and a massive 100,000 litres for 1kg of beef. By these figures, producing one kilogram of beef uses as much water as: 40 baths, 300 toilet flushes, and 100 times the clean water needed by an individual according to UNESCO\nSince a large percentage of the crops we feed to our farmed animals are grown on 'ghost acres' in developing countries, this wasted water is coming not just from our own reserves but from the very countries where drinking water is most scarce. Not only is eating less meat good for your health, the water and energy saving is very high.\nWorld meat production has quadrupled in the past 50 years and livestock now outnumber people by more than 3 to 1. In other words, the livestock population is expanding at a faster rate than the human population. A cow will produce 120kg of methane per year, which as a powerful greenhouse gas, is the equivalent of 2.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide.\nVegan Society - Donald Weston House, 7 Battle Road, St.Leonards-On-Sea,\nEast Sussex, TN37 7AA.

Photo: Matt Baume\nWhen most San Franciscans turn on a faucet, they'll see water that's traveled as far as two hundred miles from Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park. But that's not the case for some locally-minded gardeners, for whom careful water stewardship is as important as selecting their crops.\nThis past weekend, the San Francisco Bike Coalition organized a rec ride that visited several gardens around the Sunset, highlighting low-impact water sources. The ride was led by Sarah Roggero of TransitionSF, an organization that promotes a locally-sourced lifestyle as an alternative to dependence on fossil fuels.\nGarden for the Environment\nThe tour began at Garden for the Environment , a pocket of green on 7th Avenue just a few blocks north of Laguna Honda Reservoir. Executive Director Blair Randall grabbed handfuls of earth, squeezing the soil into a ball to show the roughly three dozen attendees how healthy soil should clump.\nIn San Francisco, Blair explained, gardeners will need to provide their plants with supplemental water during the dry summers. Even native drought-tolerant plants will benefit from a little assistance, around half a gallon per plant per week. Vegetables and fruit trees will need more, he added -- theirs receive much as fifteen gallons per week, some of which comes from rainwater catchment barrels. A modest installation alongside a greenhouse collects water during storms, then parcels out the moisture during dryer months.\nThe San Francisco Public Utilities Commission recently completed a highly successful rebate program to encourage residents to install their own rainwater collection systems. Although the rebate has ended, the PUC continues to encourage the practice, offering instructions and a video tutorial for building your own. Organizations like Greywater Action offer further training and workshops.\nBlair recommended that gardeners use drip-irrigation: a thin tube, perforated with small holes, slowly releases water close to the roots. In contrast, sprinklers lose much of their water to wind, evaporation, and weeds. Compost, manure, wood chips, and straw also help keep moisture close to the roots.\nHe also advised that gardeners observe and exploit San Francisco's natural advantages -- for example, planting in the fall to take advantage of the rain, and favoring Mediterranean plants like artichokes. It's important to keep an eye out techniques and species that prove successful, since every garden is unique.\n\"The key to success as a gardener,\" he said, \"is your power of observation.\"\nBlair describes water usage at Garden for the Environment. Photo: Matt Baume.\nReservoir History\nFrom Garden for the Environment, the caravan of bikers travelled west to the Sunset Reservoir, a 270-acre, 88-million-gallon tank between 24th and 28th Avenues.\nThe reservoir, built in the 1960s, showcases some modern low-impact technology: newly-installed panels on the roof have tripled the city's solar power generation, and starting in 2013, the PUC plans to introduce locally-sourced groundwater. That local water could prove vital if an emergency cuts off the city's distant water sources.\nHistorian and explorer Joel Pomerantz stood in front of the massive slab of the reservoir, describing the city's many natural water sources. Mountain Lake, for example, was an early source of potable water for San Franciscans, with a flume reaching all the way around Fort Mason to what is now the Marina.\nToday, our water is derived largely from Hetch Hetchy, as well as reservoirs on the Peninsula and in the Alameda watershed .\nAll of San Francisco's water sources are controlled by the Public Utilities Commission, said Pomerantz, which he sees as a potential problem. \"The more water systems the PUC is in charge of, the more it's a centrally controlled system,\" he said, explaining that a more independent, neighborhood-based authority would guard against what he called \"political control.\"\nOur modern central authority is a far cry from San Francisco's early days, when dozens of wells dotted the city. \"We don't allow people to just dig up their own wells,\" confirmed SFPUC spokesperson Tyrone Jue. \"They would have to get a permit. ... We'd talk to them. It's all about public health at that point.\" A few local wells remain in use for irrigation purposes, such as at the San Francisco Zoo and in Golden Gate Park.\nBut drilling down to the aquifer -- about three hundred feet, out in the Sunset -- is expensive, as is testing the water to ensure health. \"If you had a personal well, we'd have to make sure you were meeting the testing requirements,\" said Jue. \"And it just becomes so onerous at that point ... why would you?\"\nJue added that sources for fresh water in the city disappeared as the city grew increasingly paved. \"Before the city was paved over, you'd have the natural creeks running down from Twin Peaks, and they'd go out into the bay. But since we've paved over the entire place, all the water is captured in the sewer system at the source. The stream never forms in the first place.\"\nResidential Solutions\nA garden featuring greywater and humanure. Photo: Matt Baume.\nNext, the bicycle caravan headed to the ocean, stopping in at the beach-adjacent home of Christina and Tim, two hardcore backyard gardeners. They welcomed the group by recommending that the riders try out their composting toilet.\nAlthough the garden featured several creative installations -- a sweat lodge, a passive-solar shower, reclaimed laundry water -- it was the composting toilet that drew the most questions. Though unfamiliar to most, \"humanure\" is nothing new: a big bucket, a little sawdust, some micro-organisms, and patience are the chief requirements for a system that doesn't smell, doesn't breed parasites, and doesn't contaminate surrounding areas.\nIt takes about a year before humanure is sufficiently broken down and rid of potential contaminants. Additional precautions are often necessary: in chilly environments like the outer Sunset, urine has to be diverted into a separate storage tank.\nIn addition to their composting toilet, Christina and Tim (along with their two housemates) also recycle their laundry water. The process begins with a biodegradable detergent like Ecos ; from there, the water is channeled into a bathtub full of cattails. The wetlands plants filter out contaminants, just like the bioswales that are appearing around the city in ever-increasing numbers.\nAfter some tinkering, the system has produced a slow trickle of naturally-scrubbed greywater, suitable for garden use, with laundry residue left behind in the plants. \"You wouldn't want to eat those cattails,\" laughed Tim.\nMost San Franciscans probably aren't ready to reconfigure their washing machine or forgo their flush-toilet. But rain barrels are inexpensive, relatively easy to operate, and a fun DIY project.\nAnd as Christina pointed out, the act of just thinking about water usage can itself be productive. She recently conducted a study of household water usage, and found that when people pay attention to the volume of water that we flush, spray, and dump, wanting to cut back is a logical next step.\nWith water imported from far-flung artificial lakes and a sewer system with a habitual overflow problem , a little lateral thinking about water might be just what we need.\n"}, {"score": 1534.0012, "uuid": "3fbe8d70-fb25-53cc-8253-4a6a7df9591d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1507wb-45-07446", "target_hostname": "www.pure-water.com.au", "target_uri": "http://www.pure-water.com.au/filtered-water.htm", "page_rank": 1.4909758e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Water</em> Filters Melbourne - Filtered <em>Water</em> - Pure <em>water</em> filters and replacement", "snippet": "Pure, filtered <em>water</em> tastes <em>better</em> <em>than</em> the standard <em>tap</em> <em>water</em> as the chemicals and heavy metals have been removed, so it <em>is</em> possible your children are naturally avoiding the chemicals found in <em>tap</em> <em>water</em> these days!", "explanation": null, "document": "why filtered water\nUnderstanding the water cycle\nWater dissolves most substances it comes in contact with. As rain falls, it collects airborne industrial pollution and small amount of farm fertiliser goes into our reservoirs.\nOur water is then piped to treatment plants where chemicals such as chlorine and ammonia are injected into our domestic water by local authorities to counter the many forms of bacteria and toxins that develop. These chemicals give our domestic water a slight odour. This chemically processed water is delivered to our households pipe.\nThe reality is, there\u2019s very little we can do to solve the overall problem of pollutants in our household water. We can reduce these issues by filtering our water.\nSo why filter?

The following conservation tips developed and recommended by water utilities throughout the country will help to reduce your individual water demand.\nSAVING WATER INDOORS\nNever put water down the drain when there may be another use for it such as watering a plant or garden, or cleaning.\nVerify that your home is leak-free, because many homes have hidden water leaks. Read your water meter before and after a two-hour period when no water is being used. If the meter does not read exactly the same, there is a leak.\nRepair dripping faucets by replacing washers. If your faucet is dripping at the rate of one drop per second, you can expect to waste 2,700 gallons per year which will add to the cost of water and sewer utilities.\nCheck for toilet tank leaks by adding food coloring to the tank. If the toilet is leaking, color will appear in the toilet bowel within 30 minutes. Check the toilet for worn out, corroded or bent parts. Most replacement parts are inexpensive, readily available and easily installed. (Flush as soon as test is done, since food coloring may stain tank.)\nAvoid flushing the toilet unnecessarily. Dispose of tissues, insects and other such waste in the trash rather than the toilet.\nTake shorter showers. Replace you showerhead with an ultra-low-flow version.\nUse the minimum amount of water needed for a bath by closing the drain first and filling the tub only 1/3 full.\nDon't let water run while shaving or washing your face. Brush your teeth first while waiting for water to get hot, then wash or shave after filling the basin.\nRetrofit all wasteful household faucets by installing aerators with flow restrictors.\nOperate automatic dishwashers and clothes washers only when they are fully loaded or properly set the water level for the size of load you are using.\nWhen washing dishes by hand, fill one sink or basin with soapy water. Quickly rinse under a slow-moving stream from the faucet.\nStore drinking water in the refrigerator rather than letting the tap run every time you want a cool glass of water.\nDo not use running water to thaw meat or other frozen foods. Defrost food overnight in the refrigerator or by using the defrost setting on your microwave.\nConsider installing an instant water heater on your sinks that are located far from your main water heater so you don't have to let the water run while it heats up. This will reduce heating costs for your household.\nInsulate your water pipes. You'll get hot water faster plus avoid wasting water while it heats up.\nIf the toilet flush handle frequently sticks in the flush position, letting water run constantly, replace or adjust it.\nSAVING WATER OUTDOORS\nDon't over-water your lawn. A hearty rain eliminates the need for watering for as long as two weeks.\nWater lawns during the early morning hours when temperatures and wind speeds are the lowest. This reduces losses from evaporation.\nDon't water your street, driveway or sidewalk. Position your sprinklers so that your water lands on the lawn and shrubs ... not the paved areas.\nInstall sprinklers that are the most water-efficient for each use. Micro and drip irrigation and soaker hoses are examples of water-efficient methods of irrigation.\nRegularly check sprinkler systems and timing devices to be sure they are operating properly. Broken or poorly adjusted sprinklers may go un-noticed since sprinklers are usually set to operate during early morning hours when we are asleep.\nRaise the lawn mower blade to at least three inches. A lawn cut higher encourages grass roots to grow deeper, shades the root system and holds soil moisture better than a closely-clipped lawn.\nAvoid over-fertilizing your lawn. The application of fertilizers increases the need for water. Don\u0092t fertilize monthly, instead apply fertilizers which contain slow-release, water-insoluble forms of nitrogen.\nMulch to retain moisture in the soil. Mulching also helps to control weeds that compete with plants for water.\nPlant native and/or drought-tolerant grasses, ground covers, shrubs and trees. Once established, they do not need to be watered as frequently and they usually will survive a dry period without any watering. Group plants together based on similar water needs.\nDo not hose down your driveway or sidewalk. Use a broom to clean leaves and other debris from these areas. Using a hose to clean a driveway can waste hundreds of gallons of water.\nOutfit your hose with a nozzle that stops water flow completely when not actually using the water. Don't forget to turn off the water at the faucet when you are finished using the hose.\nDo not leave sprinklers or hoses unattended. Your garden hoses can pour out 600 gallons or more in only a few hours, so don't leave the sprinkler running all day. Use a kitchen timer to remind yourself to turn it off.\nCheck all hoses, connectors and spigots regularly. Replace hard leaky hose washers to eliminate leaks.\nIf you wash your own car, use a bucket for the soapy water and a hose end shut-off nozzle.\nAvoid the installation of ornamental water features (such as fountains) unless the water used to fill it is recycled. Locate where there are minimal losses due to evaporation and wind drift.\nFor additional water conservation tips, please visit the conservation areas of these websites:\n\u00a92008 Valencia Water Company\n"}, {"score": 1531.7888, "uuid": "3b68ce5a-2b74-5949-8705-e67ccd392897", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0808wb-13-04036", "target_hostname": "www.metrowater.com", "target_uri": "http://www.metrowater.com/index.php?pg=23", "page_rank": 1.5071979e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "Metro <em>Water</em>", "snippet": "Locate <em>plants</em> where they can take advantage of this extra <em>water</em>.

By following this guide, you can reduce the amount of water you use and still keep your yard green and attractive. All it takes is a little maintenance, letting your plants tell you when they need water, and adjusting your watering schedule.\nUse Mother Nature as the primary irrigator. We are the supplementers.\nOnly Irrigate to establish plants: no longer than 3 years.\nSupplement with hand watering during times of prolonged drought.\nSet irrigation system clocks to manual ensuring that plants are watered only when they need water.\nPlant only low water using plants.\nPlant grass only for functional, physical use - such as children's play areas, parks, ball fields.\nHand Watering vs. Drip System\nAn old fashioned handheld hose may be your most effective way to water. An American Water Works Association study found that \"households that water with a handheld hose use 33% less water outdoors than other households.\"\nUnfortunately, technology can give a false sense of security. People think that because they have a drip system they are saving water and forget to maintain them or change timers. Drip irrigation systems save water ONLY if they are regularly maintained and the irrigation timer is adjusted per season.\nWatering by hose or at least putting your irrigation system on manual means you only water when the plants need it.\nWhen watering by hose, use a kitchen timer as a reminder to turn off the water.\nPrinciples for a Water Efficient Landscape\nPlanning and Design\nMake a plan of your site to determine how you intend to use areas around your home. The area closest to the house or building should have the most plants to provide shade, coolness and aesthetic appeal. Plan to group plants together that have similar water needs.\nLow-Water-Using Plants\nMany beautiful plants use little water, provide year round color and little maintenance. Select plants that once established, will not need irrigation. Appropriate placement of plants helps reduce energy bills. Grouping plants of common water usage makes for easier care. Check out our demonstration garden for ideas on low maintenance and low water using plants.\nLimit Grass Areas\nGrass uses more water than anything else in a yard and requires more maintenance. Plant only low water use turf and place it where it is functional. Consider using one of the many drought tolerant groundcovers instead.\nWater Harvesting Techniques\nIncorporate water harvesting techniques into your landscape design. Locate plants where they can take advantage of this extra water. Channel runoff from rain to plants. Slope walkways toward plantings.\nEfficient Irrigation\nMatch your irrigation method to the type of plant being watered - hand water or use drip irrigation for individual plants and spray irrigation for grass. Do not apply water faster than the soil can absorb it.\nMulches\nApply mulches such as compost, bark chips, decomposed granite or river rock at the base of plants to retain moisture, keep weeds down and control erosion.\nProper Maintenance\nMany low-water using plants need little or no maintenance. Occasional pruning, fertilizing, weeding and pest control may be all that is necessary. Maintain the irrigation system to repair leaks. Irrigate efficiently.\nA landscaper's job is to keep your grass, shrubs and plants green and so there is a tendency to over water. Ask your landscaper to keep your yard attractive but to use water efficiently.\nEffective Watering Schedules\nMany people over water their plants even though most plants can survive just fine with less water than they receive.\nWater Deeply and Less Frequently\nThis will encourage the root system to expand and strengthen, and uses water more efficiently. To follow this important rule, you can use the weather as an effective gauge for your watering schedule. Also, you should let your plants tell you when they need water. This requires you to regularly adjust when you water and how you set your drip irrigation timer, if you have one.\nIf plants wilt in the heat, begin to lose their leaves, or are not thriving, you may need to increase the watering times.

The upshot of the report is that tens of millions of Americans are unwittingly being subjected to a bizarre medical experiment with unpredictable results. No scientist can say for certain whether long-term exposure to micro doses of multiple pharmaceuticals is safe because such an experiment has never before been conducted on any population.\nAccording to the Water Quality Association, home water filtration systems provide the highest technology available for treatment of drinking water. While water utilities are required to meet safety standards set by the U.S. EPA, home filtering systems act as a final contaminant barrier and can further purify water for drinking.\nPharmaceutical Removing Products:\nCuZn 1 Micron Countertop and Under-Counter Water Filters\nCysts: Cryptosporidium and Giardia\nA Cyst is a closed pocket or pouch of tissue; a cyst can be filled with air, fluid, pus, or other material. Common water-borne microbiological cysts are Cryptosporidium or Giardia cysts.\nCryptosporidium is a parasite that enters lakes and rivers through sewage and animal waste. It causes cryptosporidiosis, a mild gastrointestinal disease. However, the disease can be severe or fatal for people with severely weakened immune systems.\nGiardia lamblia is a parasite that enters lakes and rivers through sewage and animal waste. It causes gastrointestinal illness (e.g. diarrhea, vomiting, cramps). Giardia outbreaks can occur in communities where water supplies become contaminated with raw sewage. It can be contracted by drinking water from lakes or streams where water-dwelling animals such as beavers and muskrats, or where domestic animals such as sheep, have caused contamination.\nWater Pollution Solution: Three excellent methods for removing cysts from drinking water is to super chlorinate the water, boil the water for one minute or use a one micron water filter.\nCyst Removing Products:\nPure Water 2Go Biological Water Bottles\nNitrates in Well Water or Springs\nDrinking water high in nitrate is potentially harmful to human and animal health. Nitrate (NO3) is a naturally occurring form of nitrogen (N) which is very mobile in water. It is essential for plant growth and is often added to soil to improve productivity. Water moving down through soil after rainfall or irrigation carries dissolved nitrate with it to ground water. In this way, nitrate enters the water supplies of many homeowners who use wells or springs.\nWater Pollution Solution: Nitrates require a special filter. Cation Resin filters are commonly used to remove Nitrates.\nNitrate Removing Products:\nCuZn Water Filters\nCauses Of Water Pollution\nThere are many causes of water pollution. But no matter the causes of water pollution, the effects to our health and environment are disastrous.\nHow To Prevent Water Pollution\nPreventing water pollution is a global political, industrial and socioeconomic problem not easily solved. But the most effective and long-term solutions start with the individual. So the question becomes, \"What can you do in your own environment to prevent water pollution?\"\nFiltering your water is the best defense. All states in the US add chlorine to municipal water supplies, and carbon filters remove chlorine. Cysts can usually be removed with a one micron carbon filter. Fluoride, which is added to water in most states, requires a special filter, as do Nitrates.\nWater Pollution Articles\nThe better educated you are about water pollution causes, effects and solutions, the better you can prevent you and your loved ones from getting sick from drinking and bathing in polluted water.

Asian Carp are voracious eaters that have been moving up the Mississippi River system threatening native species wherever they go. An electric fence was constructed near Chicago to prevent the carp from traveling from the Illinois River through the artificial canal system and into Lake Michigan. Unfortunately, last year Asian Carp DNA was found in the waterway beyond the electric fence sparking fears the fish have breached the barrier and will establish themselves in the Great Lakes. Efforts since then have focused on a dual track of determining the extent of the immediate problem and finding a long-term solution. Initial results are promising that they have not established themselves in the Great Lakes, yet, but efforts will continue to determine the extent of the Asian Carp invasion.\nClimate and Clean Energy\nClean Water Action and all of the other activists and allies working for strong, comprehensive climate and energy legislation are still waiting for the introduction of new climate and energy legislation by US Senators Kerry (D-MA) and Lieberman (I-CT).

The oceans are exposed to many sources of stress, e.g. air and water pollution from shipping, waste dumping, and even oil spills. Furthermore, climate change poses a threat to marine ecosystems as water temperatures increase, sea levels rise, and ocean waters acidify. If efforts to protect the oceans and climate were bundled, however, the oceans\u2018 resources could be both managed for sustainable use by today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s generations and much better protected.\nUBA website \u201eSchutz der Meere\u201c\nThe Alps: Adapting to changing water availability\nAs a supra-regional water supplier in Europe, the Alps are particularly affected by climate change.

A new paper by UBA identifies its sources and shows what can be done to prevent its input. The 20,000 tonnes of waste dumped annually into the North Sea have added up to a volume of some 600,000 cubic metres that is accumulated in and on the seabed. Northeast Atlantic beaches are littered on average with 712 waste items per 100 metres of coastline. This litter is a threat to marine animals \u2013 they become entangled in it and are strangled or swallow it and suffocate or die of starvation.

Through the cooperation Coca-Cola will aim to improve water use with a three part focus on reduced use, recycling and replenishing within the supply chain.\nIn terms of reduction, like many of its rivals, TCCC has already begun trying to cut down on water usage, and by 2008 will set itself specific targets on efficiency to ensure it continues to cut down capacity requirements. In the last five years, though the group's sales volumes have increased by 14.6 per cent, it has managed to reduce water use for according to its figures.\nBesides simply reducing the amount of water used in the manufacture of its products, the company will also step up recycling to reduce the agricultural impact of its operations.\nThough TCCC estimates that about 85 per cent of its operations return water used for manufacturing to the environment following treatment, by 2010 it hope to have extended the process to all of its production methods.\nThe final focus will concentrate on community initiatives within its sourcing practices, from expanding rain water harvesting, to establishing greater sanitisation and education programmes within every community it works with. TCCC has also agreed to repopulate 3,000 hectares of rainforest in Brazil.\nOutside of its own production, the group will also move to bring reform to its supply and packaging chains, by adopting practices supported by WWF on sourcing and cultivation of raw materials like sugar cane.\nCarter Roberts, WWF US president, welcomed Coca-Cola's strategy as an important step in the battle against the detrimental climatic change.\n\"The water crisis is as important as climate change,\" he stated. \"Thousands of people die each day from polluted water. Freshwater species are more at risk for extinction.\"\nWith climate change also expected to exacerbate water stocks globally in coming years both TCCC and WWF will also cooperate on reducing harmful emissions and other factors linked to drought.\nHowever, TCCC is not the only company who have prioritised reforms sustainable to water usage.

We love our water based recreational activities and we love drinking the stuff.\u00a0 Those above the age of 25 probably have fond memories of sunny summer days spent guilt free under the sprinkler; darting around in bathers having water fights with mates using the latest ultimate water gun or using dozens of water filled balloons.\nBut now times have changed. With water restrictions in most part of Australia, water is now a commodity that is getting more precious than gold. Every drop counts as the dams seem to decrease in level at a drastically fast rate.\u00a0 In reaction, rising costs and increased public awareness of the plight of this vital resource has encouraged more people to look at ways to not only use water wisely, but looking at genuine ways of re-using water that has already been used.\nSo how can you \u2018re-use\u2019 water? What are the limitations, classifications and processes involved in safely catching, storing and using grey water? How can you avoid creating black water? The need to re-think and consider more productive ways to save and re-use water has fast become an everyday priority. Believe it or not, grey is now certainly the new blue.\nQuick Links\nThe Do's And Don't's Of Grey Water\nWater and Today:\nCurrently, the average Australian household uses about 240,000 litres (about 5 domestic swimming pools) of fresh water each year. Of this 240,000 litres, about 13% is flushed down the toilet, another 25% is used in the bathroom for showering, brushing teeth, shaving, washing hands etc, while a whopping 32% is used in the garden.\nHaving said all that stats are showing that Australians are becoming increasingly aware of the uses of grey water. In 2007 the Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted a survey on people\u2019s views and practices in regards to environmental issues . Results showed that more than half (55%) of all Australian households were using grey water.In addition, the majority of Australian households admitted to undertaking water saving activities., with 67% of people revealing that were saving water in the bathroom, 64% in the laundry, 50% in the kitchen, and 40% in the toilet.\nWhat is Grey Water?\nWhen you turn a tap on, fresh, drinkable water (hopefully) comes out of your tap. Depending on what contaminants that water comes in contact with between the tap and the plug, that water that goes down the plug is generally classed as grey water. The term \u2018grey water\u2019 originates in most part due to a cloudy appearance that water may get after its use, and\u00a0 also from its status as being the water that is neither \u2018Black water\u2019 (heavily polluted water like sewage or chemical infused water) or \u2018Fresh water\u2019 (occasionally referred to \u2018white water\u2019).\u00a0 Grey water\u2019s most likely sources are those that don\u2019t contaminate the water with \u2018black water creating chemicals or waste during it use. They are generally non-toilet plumbing systems such as hand basins, washing machines, showers, baths, spa baths, laundry tubs, kitchen sinks and dishwashers.\nSome people often refer to grey water as \u2018recycled\u2019 water, however technically this is not the case. The green community see recycled water as being water that has been treated and then put back in the pipes, ready for human consumption again (usually sourced from waste water or from a usually undrinkable water source; i.e. sewage or sea water). London is perhaps the most well known for recycling their sewage water. In fact there is a fantastic quip about the London water recycling program that claims that for every glass of water you drink in London, it has been drunk 6 times before. Research conducted by the London Metropolitan Water Board in the 1960s.\nWhat is Black Water?\nThe term \u2018black water\u2019 is used to describe water that has been contaminated with chemicals, faecal matter, urine, oil, food and some detergents. Black water is harmful to drink and is not suitable for distribution on gardens due to increased toxins that could be harmful to humans, pets and the environment. It is also referred to as \u2018waste water\u2019, \u2018toilet waste\u2019 and \u2018sewage\u2019.\nAvoid Turning Fresh or Grey Water into Black Water:\nBy staying aware of what you are mixing with your fresh water, it can be quite easy to ensure your water usage results in grey water and not black water. There are some simple changes you could make that will dramatically reduce your contaminating your water in all water using rooms in your house.\nInstall a lint filter in your washing machine.\nAvoid urinating in the shower or bath.\nScraping food scraps into a bin before putting plates or dishes into the dishwasher.\nLately laundry products have been putting an (NP) symbol on their products to indicate that the product has little or no phosphorus. Look for products with this symbol.\nDon\u2019t unnecessarily overuse on detergents.\nUse liquid detergents rather than powders.\nIn the kitchen, filter the water to help remove fats and oils.\nTry to separate dirty washing; for eg work clothes, that may contain harmful chemicals such as paint or oil. Once you have a full load of these clothes, divert the water used to clean the load down the usual pipes, not into your grey water system.\nHave a trial section on your garden to see if there are any effects of your grey water on your lawn.\nAvoid corrosive chemicals. Look for the Corrosive Chemical Logo.\nAlso avoid water softeners and conditioners because they involve replacing the magnesium and calcium in hard water with sodium; this thus alters the mineral content and spoils the foundation of the soil.\nCheck the pH levels of your soil on a regular basis. Good soil pH test kits are about $20 and can be purchased from any good nursery.\nChoosing detergents and cleaners:\nSimply, the chemicals used in some cleaners and detergents present possibly the quickest way to turn your grey water into black water. It is quite important to take into consideration what types of detergents, soaps and chemicals you are using in the household for washing, cooking, showering etc. When looking for detergents and cleaners, keep the following ingredients to a minimum or monitor their levels as they can contain harmful characteristics:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sodium (Salts)\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 pH\n-Sodium (Salts):\nSodium and salts are included in washing powders as fillers. It is important to minimise the sodium content of grey water to prevent soil salinity. Generally, anything higher than the accepted level of 20g of sodium per wash is likely to become problematic however obviously the lower this figure is, the better your garden will tolerate the sodium level. It is worth noting that concentrated powders and liquids do have lower salt levels than the everyday washing powder.\u00a0 It is also interesting to note also that powder detergents have about 10-20 times more sodium than liquid detergents. `\nIn a shameless plug, aToMik Green\u2019s Enviroclean Front Load Liquid Laundry 1L contains about 2 grams of sodium, well and truly below the maximum level. It is possible to find product with even lower sodium levels however.\nSodium and salts are included in washing powders as filler. Concentrated powders and liquids do have lower slat levels than the everyday washing powder. It is important to minimise the sodium content of grey water to prevent soil salinity. Generally the accepted level of sodium per wash is 20g, however obviously the lower this figure is, the better your garden will tolerate the sodium level. Anything higher than 20g is likely to become problematic. It is interesting to note also that powder detergents have about 10-20 times more sodium than liquid detergents.\nIn a shameless plug, aToMik Green\u2019s Enviroclean Front Load Liquid Laundry contains about 2 grams of sodium, well and truly below the maximum level. In addition there are other products on sale that do have lower levels.\n-Phosphorus:\nPhosphorus is used as a \u2018builder\u2019 in laundry detergents as well as a simply way to overcome the \u2018hardness\u2019 of some water qualities. It is believed that high level of phosphorus in grey water can be extremely toxic to plants, especially native Australian plants as it can cause iron deficiency.\nGenerally, the accepted maximum level of phosphorus is 7.8 grams per wash however there seems to be some conjecture as to why this is the chosen accepted level. Lanfax Lab s argue that \u201cThe reason for this level is unclear as there is no obvious scientific evident to show this level is safe. Indeed, converting 7.8 g P/wash for a front loader using 25 L per wash, gives a concentration of 300 mg/L. Interesting that many of the sewage treatment works are required to remove phosphorus to less than 1 mg/L.\u201d The site also displays two very interesting graphs detailing Phosphorus levels in common front load and top load washing powders. You may be interested to note where aToMik Green\u2019s own EnviroClean products are placed.\nPerhaps the safest way to ensure that you are not exceeding tolerable PH levels is to simply purchase products that contain as little to no phosphorus as possible. Recently product manufacturers have been marking their products with an \u2018NP\u2019 symbol to show that the product contains little or no phosphorous to make this selection process a little easier.\n-Nitrogen\nGenerally, there is are low levels of nitrogen in washing detergents and in small quantities nitrogen can be quite useful to the plants for fertilizing and aiding in plant growth. An excess of nitrogen however can lead to acidification and nitrate leaching, which is damaging to the soil quality. It is interesting to note that liquid detergents have been found to have more nitrogen than powders.\n-Boron, Borate or Boroteam:\nBoron seems to be to plants what reality TV show Big Brother was to Australians. It\u2019s tolerable, perhaps even beneficial to begin with, but prolonged periods of exposure to it can become quite detrimental to health.\nBoron is used in washing detergents as a source of 'active oxygen', however it can also be found in toothpastes as an anti-bleaching ingredient. For the trivia buffs, Boron and its derivatives are also used in glassware to withstand immediate changes in temperature,\nHigh levels of Boron are believed to cause leaf burn in some plants, as well posing some difficulties when removing it once added to soil. It is also believed that Boron reduces the soils ability to absorb water. Having said that, through all the research conducted for this Boron section in washing detergents, there does not seem to be a genuine, fear invoking reason why Boron should be so drastically avoided in the same way Sodium and Phosphorus need to be avoided. Many, many resources seem to simply add Boron to their avoid list, but simply do not mention why. Whilst we are not completely dismissing the possibility that Boron does pose a \u2018grey water threat\u2019 we encourage you to make to your own decision as to what levels of Boron you are comfortable using. Alternatively, it may be simply easier to err on the side of the majority and simply look for products that contain little to no Boron at all.\n-Chlorine\nChlorine is used in cleaning products primarily to sanitise, disinfect, whiten and deodorise clothes as well as purifying the water. Like Boron, it seems to be an ingredient that has some advantages and disadvantages. It is generally agreed that Chlorine can be quite toxic to soil as it kills off vital soil based organisms, block normal metabolic processes and act as a substitute for similar, required nutrients. Leaf burn is also an easy to spot symptom of chlorine in the soil.\nHowever,\u00a0 it also seems chlorine is thoroughly recommended as a grey water disinfectant, especially if the grey water is being used to flush toilet as the chance of diseases being spread through splashing is considerable.\nWhen considering cleaning products, try to find a product that has no chlorine included at all.\n-Soaps:\nIt is worthwhile being mindful of the soaps that you use if you are intending to reuse the water from the shower or bathroom sink. Fats from soaps that end up in can make the soil water-repellent. If you do use \u2018normal\u2019 soaps, it may be worth considering a change to a \u2018fat free soap. Alternatively, use a soil rewetting agent on areas that have received soap infused grey water.\n-pH:\nWhile Grey Water should be healthy for your plants, too much of it can raise the pH level in your soil. Simply, the pH level is a measure of either the acidity or alkalinity level of your soil. Somewhat humorously, there seems to be a fair bit of disagreement as to what the p and H actually represent, with the p being anything from Power, to Potenz, to potential, to pH actually meaning \u2018power of hydrogen\u2019. What is important is to remember that pure water is said to be neutral, although neutral is not represented by 0, instead those that could decided it is should be 7.0. Acidic soils have a value less than 7.0, while alkalinic soils generally has a pH level greater than 7.0. Trusty old Wikipedia has a interesting article on the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of having either acidic of alkalinic soils, which may be handy to know if you are interested to see what plants prefer to grow in either situation.\nSigns that your soil is possibly too alkalinic is an iron insufficiency in plants, resulting in new leaves on your plants turning yellow with green veins. A high alkaline reading also means minerals such as iron and zinc become less available to plants. Alternatively, high acidic readings generally means nutrients such as nitrates, phosphates, and potassium become less available to plants.\nIt is quite easy to test the pH level of your soil and your grey water. Testing units are generally pretty cheap, (<$20) and reasonably easy to use. Remember that an acceptable pH level in grey water is between 7-7.5.\nGrey Water Regulations\nThe use of grey water comes with some pretty strict rules and regulations about it sourcing, use, storage. The rules need to be strict considering the potential risks of damage to health and the environment if collected, stored or used incorrectly, and the regulations do vary from state to state. GMagazine have provided an excellent resource of links and information detailing grey water regulations from state to state.\nPurple Pipes\nTo avoid cross-connection and contamination, all pipes designed to carry grey water are now to be coloured purple to distinctly show what that is contains grey water. An interesting article from The Australian in 08 November 2008 says that the pipes \u201csupply water for purposes such as laundry washing, toilet flushing and irrigation, while water for kitchens, showers and bathrooms is carried in white or blue pipes.\u201d Most grey water systems should come with some sort of purple hose system (although it may be just the bare basic hose system).\nGrey water systems:\nThere are currently about three different types of grey water systems commercially available, ranging from the quite simple to the horribly complex. Essentially, all Grey water systems serve the basic task of collecting grey water for the purpose of re-using it.\nGrey water treatment system\nPerhaps the most complex and expensive and option is what is basically know as a \u2018Grey Water Treatment System\u2019 Costing around $10,000, a Grey water treatment systems offers\u00a0 the opportunity to store grey water beyond the regulated 24 hours period by treating and filtrating the water though various layers of sand and gravel. The resulting \u2018grey water but not a greyer that normal grey water\u2019 is then stored in another tank ready for use. Aside the cost, there are other downsides to this system. The size required to house all the tanks and filtration system is simply beyond the available space most inner city dwellings have to offer. In addition there is reputedly a fair amount of red tape one must wade through the get the system approved as they do need council approval.\nHowever, obviously for the price you do get some pretty good benefits. The system allows the grey water to be safely used also within the home for purposes such as flushing the toilet, and in possibly laundry washing. They are usually an odourless and relatively silent system also, especially is a gravity fed system is used as opposed to a pump system.\nGrey Water Diversion System\nGrey Water Diversion systems are possibly the most popular system used in homes. It can range from the simplest of methods as purchasing a cheap pipe attachment that diverts water from your washing machine pipe into a collection point, most likely bucket \u2013 up to systems with pumps and filters.\nThe simplest of diversion system shouldn\u2019t cost more than $200 (check out Greenfoot\u2019s step by step guide to building an easy system costing about $120 http://www.greenfoot.com.au/2006/11/23/build-your-own-grey-water-system/) and even that much is toward the top of the expense scale. These kinds of systems can connect washing machines to the garden and can basically remove the manual labour side of collecting and directing grey water.\nObviously you can spend a little more and attach pumps and filters to your system, again removing more of the manual labour side of grey water collecting. Pumps installed on diversion systems are great as they are only activated when waste water is diverted into the system, which then in turn pumps the water to wherever you need it to go. They also automatically turn off when the tank is empty.\nPerhaps the greatest feature of this system is that, more often than not, it can be self installed. Parts are easily purchased through warehouse or plumbing companies and can be as elaborate and encompassing as you want and generally require little maintenance.\nManual bucketing\nThe cheapest but most manual system is simply using a bucket to collect water before it goes down the sink, for example under the shower while waiting for the water to warm up. Bucketing is a great way to safely irrigate your garden, lawns, and outdoor pot plants as you can completely control what chemicals and other nasties go into the water and where you put the grey water. Although it is by far the most laborious of systems, the $2 you spend on the bucket certainly makes it the most cost attractive.\nRebates\nBoth the Federal government and most state government offer so sort of rebate on grey water systems or water saving devices. Check out aToMik Green's Rebate page to get a comprehensive list of rebates you may be eligible for.\nWhat To Do With Grey Water After 24 Hours Of Storage.\nThrough-out researching this, site after business after organisation reminded us that we cannot store grey water from more than 24 hours for a variety of reasons, however NOT ONE could tell us what to actually do with the water afterwards. After pestering the EPA and aToMik's local water authority with numerous emails and phone calls, pieces of clues were put together to establish what appears to be an answer.\nGrey water must never be put into your storm water drain for obvious reasons. The only safe way to dispose of 'old' grey water is by flushing it down your sewage system via the Overflow Relief Gully (ORG) , which is the grated concrete mound that almost all residential sewage systems have outside 'behind' the toilet. Do not pour grey water into your toilet for health reasons.\nThe may be harder than it sounds, especially if your system does not allow easy transportation of the grey water. If you cannot transport the water, it may be worth thinking about having some sort of flushing system installed onto your grey water system that is connected to the ORG which dirverts old grey water.\nThe Do\u2019s of Grey water:\nDo install a grey water treatment system only via a professional -\u00a0 not only will it save you time, stress and effort but many rebates initiatives stipulate the system be installed by a registered plumber in order to be eligible for the rebate.\nDo monitor your soil\u2019s pH levels, do smell test, and check up on \u2018life forms\u2019 like worms and garden bugs.\nDo watch your irrigation needs. If it doesn't need water, don't water it!\nDo try and disperse the water under the surface. Under service water system are as easy as a up-side-down soft drink bottle \u00bc buried with a small hole in the lid.\nDo remember that there is a difference between grey water and rain water, especially when it comes to storage.\nDo rotate grey water usage around your garden.\nDo think carefully about the products you use inside the house and what affect that will have outside e.g: disinfectants, hair dye, bleach, cleaners.\nDo filter out as many solids as you can like leaves and seeds.\nDo get to know grey water rules and regulations. Check out GMagazine's list of state based grey water regulations .\nDo try and use the waste water from baths, showers, hand basins and washing machines.\nDo wash your hands after every time you use grey water.\nDo place warning and \u201cDo Not Drink\u201d signs on all outlets of your grey water system\nDo ensure that all pipes that carry grey water are coloured purple. This is an requirement.\nThe Don\u2019t's of Grey water:\nDon't store untreated grey water for more than 24hours \u2013 simply, it's against regulations. Don't feel you should water just because the grey water is available. Overwatering can can drown your plants and damage your soil.\nDon't allow pets or children to play in pooled grey water.\nDon't simply hose it around like you would when using mains water. Try to localise use to one area of your garden, and try to disband it under mulch or alternative subsurface.\nDon't use water that has been possibly been tainted with grease, bacteria, chemicals. Certainly avoid water spoiled by urine or faeces. See the section on Black Water.\nDon't let grey water wash into your neighbour\u2019s property - nothing says neighbourly squabble like your waste water in the next door\u2019s rose bush.\nDon\u2019t use grey water on or near vegetable gardens if you plan to eat the crop raw or uncooked.\nDon\u2019t continue use if you smell odours or your plants begin to look unhealthy.\nDon\u2019t ever drink grey water or allow children or pets to drink it!\nAll prices are in AUD.

(This is equivalent to 2.5 cm (1'') of water.) To estimate the correct amount of water your lawn needs, place an empty tuna can on your lawn. Once the water has reached the top of the can you have applied 2.5 cm of water!\nSkip a week of watering if it rains. When your lawn turns slightly brown, it is simply dormant not dead. It will turn green again shortly after a rainfall.\nLess frequent watering actually encourages deeper healthier lawn roots.\nWater your lawn during the coolest part fo the day (early morning or late evening) and avoid windy or hot days to reduce water loss through evaporation.\nSet mower height to keep grass between five and eight centimetres (two or three inches) high. Tall grass will retain water better.\nLeave grass clippings on your lawn. This will help water retention and inhibit weed growth.\nAvoid walking on and mowing grass during periods of drought to reduce additional stress.\nAerate your lawn once a year, spring or fall, to improve water penetration\nTrees\nDeliver water where it is needed. Direct water to the plant's root system, which is usually the area directly below the outer tips of the branches.\nUse a soaker hose rather than a sprinkler. Not only does this reduce evaporation, but this will also enable you to direct water to the roots where it's needed, rather than the leaves.\nPrioritize your watering needs and don't water until the plants need it. Test the soil with your finger to see how dry it is.\nNative plants and most perennials can wait until the next rainfall.\nGauge what stage of growth your plants are at. Usually, well-established plants will require less water.\nAvoid direct water by hose, which can wash away soil and expose plants to disease.\nLandscaping\nEcoscape your yard. Consider planting drought-tolerant native plants, for which rainfall is usually enough.\nPlace plants with similar water requirements close together.\nIncrease the soil's water retention by adding compost.\nAdd a layer of mulch around the base of trees and shrubs to reduce weed growth and evaporation.\nGrass will compete with plant roots for water. Keep your lawn at least two feet from the stem of newly planted shrubs and trees.\nWeed regularly, as weeds compete with your plants for water.\nConsider replacing lawn with native ground cover or herbs and flowers that will require little maintenance and water.\nOther Outdoor Water Saving Tips\nPlace sprinklers so they are not watering driveways, sidewalks or streets.\nUse automatic timers or sprinklers if you will be leaving during watering.\nMake sure hoses and irrigation equipment are in good condition. Check regularly for leaks or blockages and shut outdoor taps off tightly after use.\nPurchase a rain barrel through the City's Rain Barrel Program to collect rainwater from your roof.\nUse a drip irrigation system. This system is the most effective because it directs water to the root zone.\nClean your sidewalks and driveways with a broom or a brush rather than using a hose.\nYour lawn and garden can not store water for a long time so don't over water to cover times you will be away.\nUse large containers for potted plants (10 inches, 25 cm) as the larger the volume of soil, the slower it dries.\nDesign a water-wise landscape in your yard.\nA water-wise ecoscape garden is based on seven principles:\nPlanning and design......for water conservation and beauty for your site and your needs.\nCreate practical turf areas......of manageable size, shape and appropriate grass.\nAmend the soil......like compost or manure as needed by the site and types of plants used.\nChose low water plants......and group plants of similar water needs together.

Take unused, unneeded or expired prescription drugs out of their original containers and throw them in the trash.\nb. Mix prescription drugs with an undesirable substance, such as used coffee grounds or kitty litter, and put them in impermeable, nondescript containers, such as empty cans or sealable bags, to further ensure the drugs are not diverted.\nc. Flush prescription drugs down the toilet only if the label or accompanying patient information specifically instructs doing so.\nd. Take advantage of community pharmaceutical take-back programs that allow the public to bring unused drugs to a central location for proper disposal.\ne. Take medications with attached needles to hospitals or other approved sites for proper disposal.\nWhere does my drinking water come from? Drinking water comes from two major sources: Water that flows aboveground, known as surface water, and water that is pumped from beneath the ground, called groundwater. Surface water comes from lakes, reservoirs and rivers. Groundwater comes from wells that water suppliers drill into aquifers - underground geologic formations of permeable rock. The majority of people in the United States - 66 % - live in areas served by large water systems that rely on surface water. However, 80% percent of public water systems are in smaller communities that rely on groundwater.\nHow does nature recycle water? The processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation and infiltration - the hydrologic cycle.\nCan groundwater be restored in any other way than the natural cycle? Yes. Some water suppliers have adopted a system call groundwater recharge. This is often done in large basins where volumes of water spread over the treated wastewater, diverted river water, surface runoff or other excess water. This reused of excess water can also be returned to the aquifer through direct injection into recharge wells.\nHow much of the Earth is covered with water, and how much of that is drinkable? Close to three-quarters of Earth's surface is covered with water, but less than 1 percent is suitable and available for drinking water using conventional water treatment.\nCan ocean water be treated to make drinking water? Ocean water contains so much salt that at least 99.2 percent of the salt must be removed to avoid a salty taste in drinking water, but it can be treated to make drinking water through a process called desalination.\nCan wastewater be treated to make it into drinking water? Yes. This practice, called potable reuse, is uncommon, but is gaining more and more acceptance around the world because of water supply limitations. The water industry commonly uses the terms reclaimed wastewater and reuse for nonpotable purposes such as park irrigation, which saves fresh water for drinking and bathing.\nIs climate change affecting our water supply? Water industry researchers tell us that climate change has significant implications for water supply management because increasing temperatures will increase evaporation rates, change precipitation patterns, affect runoff and water quality and change water-use demands.\nHow can I help prevent pollution of drinking water sources?\na. Keeping litter; pet wastes, leaves and debris out of street gutters and storm drains.\nb. Applying lawn and garden chemicals sparingly and according to directions.\nc. Disposing of used oil, antifreeze, paints and other household chemicals properly, not in storm sewers or drains. Ask about your community household hazardous waste collection program.\nd. Cleaning up spilled brake fluid, oil, grease and antifreeze. Do not hose them into the street where they can eventually reach local streams and lakes.\ne. For more information visit www.epa.gov/nps , http://www.groundwater.org/ , http://www.lgean.org/ .\nConservation\nWhat indoor home activity uses the most water? Inside the home, water use is evenly distributed among appliances, but nearly 30 percent is flushed down the toilet. A typical household of four uses 400 gallons of water per day. Clothes washing accounts for 26 percent, followed by showers at 20 percent and faucets (washing dishes, brushing teeth, etc.) at 19 percent.\nWhat about outside use - how can I conserve water there?\na. Maintain a lawn height of 2 \u00bd to 3 inches to help protect the roots from heat stress and reduce the loss of moisture to evaporation.\nb. Promote deep root growth through proper watering, aerating, fertilization, grass-clipping control and attention to lawn height. A lawn with deep roots requires less water and is more resistant to drought and disease.\nc. Avoid planting turf in areas that are difficult to irrigate properly, such as steep inclines and isolated strips along sidewalks and driveways.\nd. Aerate clay soils at least once a year to help the soil retain moisture.\ne. Mulch around plants, bushes and trees to help the soil retain moisture, discourage the growth of weeds and provide essential nutrients.\nf. Plant in the spring or fall, when watering requirement are lower.\ng. When choosing plants, keep in mind that smaller ones require less water to become established.\nh. Use porous materials for walkways and patios to keep water in your yard and prevent wasteful runoff.\ni. Use an adjustable hose nozzle for plant irrigation, and be sure to shut water off at the house connection each time an exterior faucet is used.\nj. Use a broom or rake to remove debris from driveways and walkways, not water.\nk. If you have a pool, keep the water level low to minimize splashing, and use a cover to slow evaporation. An average-sized pool can lose about 1,000 gallons of water per month if left uncovered.\nl. Use a bucket of soapy water and a hose with a shutoff nozzle to wash your car.\nWhich uses more water, a bath or a shower? A full bathtub requires about 70 gallons of water, while taking a five-minute shower under a low-flow showerhead uses 10 to 25 gallons. Don't run water down the drain while it heats up\nWe had a conservation drive in our area and everyone cooperated. Then our water rates went up. Why? Water suppliers have fixed costs - salaries, hydrant maintenance, mortgages and so forth. They must collect this money regardless of water use, so when water volume goes down because of conservation by the public, the cost of each gallon of water used sometimes is raised to provide the water supplier with the money it needs to maintain its system. However, water conservation can eventually lead to stable improvements or new investments can be postponed if demand does not increase.\nI leave the water running while I brush my teeth. Does this waste much water? Yes. Leaving the water running is a bad habit; about 4 to 6 gallons of water go down the drain every time you brush. The average bathroom faucet runs at a rate of about 2 gallons a minute. Turning of f the water will save water and save you money.\nI use a lot of water in the kitchen. How can I conserve there?\na. Remove residue from each cooking utensil and dish without using water and don't rinse them before putting in the dishwasher.\nb. Clean vegetables in a pan of water rather than under running tap water, then us that water to give your plants a drink.\nc. Use the garbage disposal sparingly.\nd. Run the dishwasher only when it is full.\ne. Keep a container of water in the refrigerator instead of running the tap to cool your drinking water.\nf. Use a pail or basin instead of running water for household cleaning. A sponge mop will use less water than a string mop.\ng. Presoak grills or oven parts overnight when they need cleaning. Wash with an abrasive scrub brush or pad and use plenty of \"elbow grease\" to minimize water use.\nHow concerned should I be about a leaky toilet? A leaky toilet can waste as much as 200 gallons of water a day. A common reason toilets leak is that the toilet flapper has become worn and no longer seals closed once the toilet has filled.\nWhy do we still have a water shortage when it's been raining at my house? It takes weeks to years for the water to recycle from rain to home use, depending on your water source. If your drinking water that comes from a well, the rainwater needs to recharge into the ground before it affects the supply. If it comes from a reservoir or surface source, the supply may be far upstream from the rain at your house, so the water source isn't being replenished.\nDuring water shortages, shouldn't decorative fountains be turned off? In most cases, fountain water is re-circulated (used over and over) and is not wasted. If water losses from evaporation are high, however, fountains should be turned off.\n"}, {"score": 1484.2916, "uuid": "c2bec515-0f50-5368-b74f-8949506e4d9a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0101wb-50-27079", "target_hostname": "www.chemicalprocessing.com", "target_uri": "http://www.chemicalprocessing.com/articles/2008/133.html", "page_rank": 1.2001311e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Maintenance and Operations | What\u0092s on <em>tap</em> <em>for</em> <em>water</em>?", "snippet": "The local <em>water</em> company, Evides, uses <em>water</em> that <em>is</em> purified in a nearby biological wastewater treatment <em>plant</em> to produce demineralized <em>water</em> that\u2019s then delivered to Dow Benelux <em>for</em> steam generation.", "explanation": null, "document": "What\u0092s on tap for water?\nThis increasingly precious resource is attracting more attention\nBy Se\u00e1n Ottewell, Editor at Large\nTo cast your vote, log in or become a member .

Chemical plants are taking new steps to conserve water, and prospects are buoyant for technologies that aim to provide usable supplies from seawater and other non-traditional sources.\nDow\u2019s integrated production site at Terneuzen, the Netherlands, underscores how plants may rethink their water use. The facility is the current holder of the European Responsible Care Award from the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic), Brussels, Belgium, for its innovative re-use of municipal wastewater. The local water company, Evides, uses water that is purified in a nearby biological wastewater treatment plant to produce demineralized water that\u2019s then delivered to Dow Benelux for steam generation. Dow uses 60,000 m3 of water per day at Terneuzen, half of which comes from recycled process water and rain water \u2014 now around 7,500 m3 comes from the nearby community.\n\u201cPrimarily we are looking at the water envelope and asking where we have the opportunity to minimize water consumption at all our sites while maximizing its recycle and reuse,\u201d notes Gen\u00e1 Leathers, global technology leader \u2014 water, wastewater, landfill, at Dow\u2019s Environmental Technology Center in Edina, Minn. \u201cThis project is an excellent example of us partnering with the local community to overcome the diminishing availability of water. We are currently working on a similar project with the community and other local industries near a site in Canada,\u201d she adds.\nThe point here is that Dow now is considering water use right at the start of the design phase for projects for both grassroots and existing sites, so it can engineer in the most appropriate treatment strategies right from the outset.\nTwenty years ago such a strategy would have been unheard of, but Leathers is confident about the way ahead. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that this requires a mind shift, a cultural change. And we are learning all the time. Also, we are finding that the folks in engineering and design are very receptive to these ideas and keep them very much in mind while doing the evaluations,\u201d she concludes.\nThis move ties in with a broader commitment the company has made to set the standard for sustainable water use and management through the application of innovative chemistry, technologies and business models.\nWorth its salt\nOne abundant but underutilized source of water is the sea. So, it\u2019s little wonder that interest in desalination plants and technologies is strong.\nAs sources of high quality water for chemical processing become increasingly scarce, Dow, for one, is targeting desalination, both of seawater and brackish water (as well as water reuse applications and small, distributed systems for local use).\n\u201cIn general, the cost of desalinated water has fallen dramatically \u2014 by more than half \u2014 in the last 15 years,\u201d says Chuck Martz, global marketing director for Dow Water Solutions in Edina. \u201cSo demand for the reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes we manufacture for use in desalination is growing rapidly on a global basis. Desalination will have double-digit growth for the foreseeable future,\u201d he adds.\nReflecting this heady prospect, in mid-June Dow announced an $88-million expansion at the Edina facility \u2014 the third investment there in eight years. Part will go for an expanded manufacturing area to boost output of advanced technologies such as RO and NF membranes and for automated production of 16-in.-diameter elements.\nPage 1 of 4\nTo cast your vote, log in or become a member .

This <em>is</em> true in VT and also true in CA - our citizen groups have documented this. The following are excerpts from HEALTH CANADA statements regarding fluoride intake.", "explanation": null, "document": "Chloramine + Lead Pipes + Fluoride = Contaminated tap water\nJuly 13, 2009\nBy Olga Naidenko, EWG Senior Scientist\nThe lead pollution crisis of the Washington, D.C. water supply - and the culprit that caused it, the water disinfection chemical chloramine - is a powerful example of how things can go terribly wrong when water quality problems are considered and tackled in isolation.\nEarlier this year, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) scientists reported the shockingly high lead levels in the blood of young Washington, D.C. children tested between 2001 and 2004, when the District of Columbia's drinking water was being contaminated with lead from aging pipes.\nUnfortunately, this situation is not unique: similar results have been reported in Greenville, North Carolina, according to studies by the Duke University researchers.\nChloramines and lead pipes: Not so good together\nAmerican water utilities are increasingly switching to chloramines, a mixture of chlorine and ammonia, for final disinfection of drinking water. Chloramine was supposed to be a \"safer\" water disinfectant than chlorine because it reduces formation of toxic chlorination byproducts. A 2005 survey by the American Water Works Association found that approximately a third of all utilities now use chloramines.\nWater disinfection byproducts are associated with increased risk of cancer and possibly adverse effects on the development of the fetus, so minimizing their levels in drinking water is a good thing. Yet, chloramines drastically increase the leaching of lead from pipes. And here is a real challenge: there are tens of thousands of lead service lines in the water system administered by the DC Water and Sewer Authority. Add to these lines the lead based solder used to join copper pipe, brass and chrome plated faucets, and water fixtures, and the opportunities for lead to leach into the drinking water multiply.\nWe all accept that water disinfection is a public health necessity. However, we need to thoroughly consider the full impact of any chemical added to drinking water given the current water distribution infrastructure in place, not in some theoretical vacuum. As described by Duke researchers, chloramine-induced lead leaching might be lessened by the addition of anticorrosivity agents during the water treatment process. Is that sufficient for protection of public health? We really don't know! Chloramine itself has been associated with severe respiratory toxicity and skin sensitivity. Overall, despite ongoing research, water treatment chemistry is still insufficiently understood by scientists and specific water quality outcomes depend on the particular chemical interactions found in each water treatment and distribution system.\nAnd now add fluoride\nIn addition to disinfection chemicals, other additives are commonly mixed with the finished drinking water before it leaves the water treatment plant. Of them, fluoride is possibly the most known. Two thirds of the U.S. municipal water supply is artificially fluoridated in an effort to prevent tooth decay. But fluoridation additives in tap water are not the same form of fluoride as found in toothpaste. Typically, water is fluoridated with fluorosilicic acid (FSA) or its salt, sodium fluosilicate, collectively referred to as fluorosilicates. In contrast, fluoride in toothpaste is usually in form of simple sodium fluoride salt, NaF.\nHere comes a second unpleasant \"surprise\" for those in lead-piped locations: fluorosilicates have a unique affinity for lead. In fact, lead fluorosilicate is one of the most water-soluble forms of lead. In fact, fluorosilicic acid has been used as a solvent for lead and other heavy metals in metallurgy. In industrial applications, chemical engineers rely on this acid to remove surface lead from leaded-brass machine parts.\nResearch shows what happens when we mix it all up\nWhat happens when fluorosilicates in water pass through lead-containing pipes and metal fixtures? Not surprisingly, the fluorosilicates extract high levels of soluble lead from leaded-brass metal parts (researchers from the Environmental Quality Institute of the University of North Carolina-Asheville performed this actual experiment).\nIn research published in the scientific journal Neurotoxicology, researchers found that the mixture of the two chemicals: disinfectant (whether chlorine or chloramine) with fluorosilicic acid has a drastically increased potency, leaching amazingly high quantities of lead .\nWhere does this lead go? Into our drinking water and right on into our bodies, where they wreak havoc by poisoning our heart, kidneys and blood, causing irreversible neurological damage and impairing reproductive function.\nNorth Carolina researchers concluded that the supposedly innocuous - and purportedly beneficial - quantities of fluoride added to drinking water may, in fact, precipitate a cascade of serious health problems, especially when chloramines and lead pipes are added into the mix.\nDo we even need fluoride in tap water?\nThe mixture of chloramine and fluorosilicates in drinking water causes extensive leaching of lead. We cannot dispense with water disinfection - everybody acknowledges this. Thus, chlorine and chloramine are probably here to stay for some time. On the other hand, fluoride, or, specifically, water fluoridation with fluorosilicates, is quite dispensable.\nBut wait - isn't fluoride the miracle chemical that improves dental health?\nWell, yes and no. Much of what is publicized today in caries prevention programs worldwide is derived from the theories generated in the 1950s and '60s, when water fluoridation was actively promoted. As we now know, the main benefits of fluoride for dental health are derived from surface application on the teeth, not from ingestion.\nIn fact, ingestion of fluoride causes dental fluorosis, a range of adverse health effects that includes mottling, pitting, and weakening of the teeth. These risks are especially significant for infants and young children. In the U.S. and worldwide, about 30 percent of children who drink fluoridated water experience dental fluorosis. In 2006, the American Dental Association (ADA) issued an \"Interim Guidance on Fluoride Intake for Infants and Young Children.\" ADA recommended that in areas where fluoride is added to tap water, parents should consider using fluoride-free bottled water to reconstitute concentrated or powdered infant formula to avoid excess fluoride.\nAccording to the latest research, the anti-caries activity of fluoride is due to topical effects, which supports the value of fluoride-containing toothpaste to dental health. There is clear evidence that fluoride dental products significantly reduce the incidence of cavities. In contrast, a substantial and growing body of peer-reviewed science suggests that ingesting fluoride in tap water does not provide any additional dental benefits other than those offered by fluoride toothpaste and may present serious health risks.\nTo learn more about fluoride health effects , read the recent report by EWG.\nThe message: Don't assess chemicals in isolation\nThe lesson here is straightforward: it is completely unscientific to simply toss any chemical into the drinking water on the premises that this chemical might provide some benefits. The real question is: what would be the effect of this chemical given what else is going on with the water system? In case of fluoridation and chloramines, what emerges at the end of the pipe (our faucets!) is a potentially highly hazardous mixture of fluorosilicates, lead, and residual levels of disinfectants.\nTo protect the health of my family today, I can buy a water filter to remove heavy metals and disinfection byproducts from my drinking water with a simple pitcher filter. But to protect the health of the entire nation, we really need to consider if our current methods of water treatment can withstand scientific scrutiny, or whether they should be re-assessed so as to provide safe, healthy tap water to all Americans.\nPosted at 8:36 PM\nTrackBack URL for this entry:\nhttp://www.enviroblog.org/cgi-bin/mt/mt-tb.cgi/1101\n"}], [{"score": 1481.416, "uuid": "28592b23-d3d6-5637-8373-fcfe761c8c42", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0107wb-66-10749", "target_hostname": "www.enviroblog.org", "target_uri": "http://www.enviroblog.org/2009/07/recipe-for-a-toxic-brew-lead-pipes-fluoride-and-disinfectants.html", "page_rank": 1.2035335e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Enviroblog: Chloramine + Lead Pipes + Fluoride = Contaminated <em>tap</em> <em>water</em>", "snippet": "But everyone got <em>better</em> when they stopped using the chloraminated <em>tap</em> <em>water</em>.

The following are excerpts from HEALTH CANADA statements regarding fluoride intake.", "explanation": null, "document": "Chloramine + Lead Pipes + Fluoride = Contaminated tap water\nJuly 13, 2009\nBy Olga Naidenko, EWG Senior Scientist\nThe lead pollution crisis of the Washington, D.C. water supply - and the culprit that caused it, the water disinfection chemical chloramine - is a powerful example of how things can go terribly wrong when water quality problems are considered and tackled in isolation.\nEarlier this year, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) scientists reported the shockingly high lead levels in the blood of young Washington, D.C. children tested between 2001 and 2004, when the District of Columbia's drinking water was being contaminated with lead from aging pipes.\nUnfortunately, this situation is not unique: similar results have been reported in Greenville, North Carolina, according to studies by the Duke University researchers.\nChloramines and lead pipes: Not so good together\nAmerican water utilities are increasingly switching to chloramines, a mixture of chlorine and ammonia, for final disinfection of drinking water. Chloramine was supposed to be a \"safer\" water disinfectant than chlorine because it reduces formation of toxic chlorination byproducts. A 2005 survey by the American Water Works Association found that approximately a third of all utilities now use chloramines.\nWater disinfection byproducts are associated with increased risk of cancer and possibly adverse effects on the development of the fetus, so minimizing their levels in drinking water is a good thing. Yet, chloramines drastically increase the leaching of lead from pipes. And here is a real challenge: there are tens of thousands of lead service lines in the water system administered by the DC Water and Sewer Authority. Add to these lines the lead based solder used to join copper pipe, brass and chrome plated faucets, and water fixtures, and the opportunities for lead to leach into the drinking water multiply.\nWe all accept that water disinfection is a public health necessity. However, we need to thoroughly consider the full impact of any chemical added to drinking water given the current water distribution infrastructure in place, not in some theoretical vacuum. As described by Duke researchers, chloramine-induced lead leaching might be lessened by the addition of anticorrosivity agents during the water treatment process. Is that sufficient for protection of public health? We really don't know! Chloramine itself has been associated with severe respiratory toxicity and skin sensitivity. Overall, despite ongoing research, water treatment chemistry is still insufficiently understood by scientists and specific water quality outcomes depend on the particular chemical interactions found in each water treatment and distribution system.\nAnd now add fluoride\nIn addition to disinfection chemicals, other additives are commonly mixed with the finished drinking water before it leaves the water treatment plant. Of them, fluoride is possibly the most known. Two thirds of the U.S. municipal water supply is artificially fluoridated in an effort to prevent tooth decay. But fluoridation additives in tap water are not the same form of fluoride as found in toothpaste. Typically, water is fluoridated with fluorosilicic acid (FSA) or its salt, sodium fluosilicate, collectively referred to as fluorosilicates. In contrast, fluoride in toothpaste is usually in form of simple sodium fluoride salt, NaF.\nHere comes a second unpleasant \"surprise\" for those in lead-piped locations: fluorosilicates have a unique affinity for lead. In fact, lead fluorosilicate is one of the most water-soluble forms of lead. In fact, fluorosilicic acid has been used as a solvent for lead and other heavy metals in metallurgy. In industrial applications, chemical engineers rely on this acid to remove surface lead from leaded-brass machine parts.\nResearch shows what happens when we mix it all up\nWhat happens when fluorosilicates in water pass through lead-containing pipes and metal fixtures? Not surprisingly, the fluorosilicates extract high levels of soluble lead from leaded-brass metal parts (researchers from the Environmental Quality Institute of the University of North Carolina-Asheville performed this actual experiment).\nIn research published in the scientific journal Neurotoxicology, researchers found that the mixture of the two chemicals: disinfectant (whether chlorine or chloramine) with fluorosilicic acid has a drastically increased potency, leaching amazingly high quantities of lead .\nWhere does this lead go? Into our drinking water and right on into our bodies, where they wreak havoc by poisoning our heart, kidneys and blood, causing irreversible neurological damage and impairing reproductive function.\nNorth Carolina researchers concluded that the supposedly innocuous - and purportedly beneficial - quantities of fluoride added to drinking water may, in fact, precipitate a cascade of serious health problems, especially when chloramines and lead pipes are added into the mix.\nDo we even need fluoride in tap water?\nThe mixture of chloramine and fluorosilicates in drinking water causes extensive leaching of lead. We cannot dispense with water disinfection - everybody acknowledges this. Thus, chlorine and chloramine are probably here to stay for some time. On the other hand, fluoride, or, specifically, water fluoridation with fluorosilicates, is quite dispensable.\nBut wait - isn't fluoride the miracle chemical that improves dental health?\nWell, yes and no. Much of what is publicized today in caries prevention programs worldwide is derived from the theories generated in the 1950s and '60s, when water fluoridation was actively promoted. As we now know, the main benefits of fluoride for dental health are derived from surface application on the teeth, not from ingestion.\nIn fact, ingestion of fluoride causes dental fluorosis, a range of adverse health effects that includes mottling, pitting, and weakening of the teeth. These risks are especially significant for infants and young children. In the U.S. and worldwide, about 30 percent of children who drink fluoridated water experience dental fluorosis. In 2006, the American Dental Association (ADA) issued an \"Interim Guidance on Fluoride Intake for Infants and Young Children.\" ADA recommended that in areas where fluoride is added to tap water, parents should consider using fluoride-free bottled water to reconstitute concentrated or powdered infant formula to avoid excess fluoride.\nAccording to the latest research, the anti-caries activity of fluoride is due to topical effects, which supports the value of fluoride-containing toothpaste to dental health. There is clear evidence that fluoride dental products significantly reduce the incidence of cavities. In contrast, a substantial and growing body of peer-reviewed science suggests that ingesting fluoride in tap water does not provide any additional dental benefits other than those offered by fluoride toothpaste and may present serious health risks.\nTo learn more about fluoride health effects , read the recent report by EWG.\nThe message: Don't assess chemicals in isolation\nThe lesson here is straightforward: it is completely unscientific to simply toss any chemical into the drinking water on the premises that this chemical might provide some benefits. The real question is: what would be the effect of this chemical given what else is going on with the water system? In case of fluoridation and chloramines, what emerges at the end of the pipe (our faucets!) is a potentially highly hazardous mixture of fluorosilicates, lead, and residual levels of disinfectants.\nTo protect the health of my family today, I can buy a water filter to remove heavy metals and disinfection byproducts from my drinking water with a simple pitcher filter. But to protect the health of the entire nation, we really need to consider if our current methods of water treatment can withstand scientific scrutiny, or whether they should be re-assessed so as to provide safe, healthy tap water to all Americans.\nPosted at 8:36 PM\nTrackBack URL for this entry:\nhttp://www.enviroblog.org/cgi-bin/mt/mt-tb.cgi/1101\n"}, {"score": 1478.5381, "uuid": "8205a437-db1b-5c4e-8398-0ccdad5ee3a9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0211wb-87-29048", "target_hostname": "www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com", "target_uri": "http://www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com/water-quality.htm", "page_rank": 1.360096e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>Tap</em> and Bottled <em>Water</em> Hidden ToxinsThreatens Our Health", "snippet": "Even in areas where <em>tap</em> <em>water</em> <em>is</em> safe to drink, demand <em>for</em> bottled <em>water</em> <em>is</em> increasing--producing unnecessary garbage and consuming vast quantities of energy.

As population pressures increase, the majority of communities around the world are facing decreasing supplies of fresh water in general and many lack access to potable water at all. This lack of access impacts human health around the globe as many die from water born diseases and related illnesses every year. For those who do have access to fresh water through private wells, springs or municipal systems, water quality can be compromised by naturally occurring heavy metals and imbalanced mineral loads or increasingly by toxic chemicals that contaminate groundwater supplies. Concerns have been raised over the potential impact that chlorine and chloramines found in municipally treated water have on human health as well. The more types of contaminants there are, the harder it becomes to adequately monitor and filter them out.\nThere are others that are being impacted as well. As the demand for fresh water increases, this precious resource is being diverted, dammed, and extracted to the degree that a large number of watersheds, and the myriad species that rely upon the water supplied by them, are being put under strain and are being listed as impaired, threatened or endangered.\nIn those communities where access to fresh water is limited and watershed health is of concern, one viable \u201clow-tech\u201d solution is to build a roof water harvesting system. By creating the means to store water on site, using the existing rainfall as the source and infiltrating the grey water and remaining run-off, one can eliminate the need to draw from precious ground water supplies and avoid the high costs (economic and environmental) of hooking into centralized conveyance and treatment systems. Humans benefit from having a self sufficient, clean water supply that additionally provides fire protection and costs far less than bottled water. The ecosystem receives benefits from the reduced erosion, flooding and pollution caused by run-off and the reduction of demand on groundwater supplies.\nAt the WATER Institute we are very interested in exploring these kinds of strategies and, through demonstration and education, work to inspire others to consider doing the same. With the help of a group of students, we designed and built a few roof water catchment systems to learn first hand what is required to build these systems and how well they work.\nThe following report details the components and illustrates the highlights of two variations on one particular design we have dubbed the Brazilian Ball Pre-Filter System. WATER Institute staff learned of this particular design while participating in the 8th International Permaculture Convergence that happened in May of 2007 in several locales across Brazil (see www.ipcon.org for more information). The images and descriptions towards the end of this report detail a few of many systems that inspired our design. We use the term \u201clow-impact\u201d to describe this system because it models the design concepts of Low Impact Development which is a \u201cstorm water management approach with a basic principle that is modeled after nature: manage rainfall at the source using uniformly distributed decentralized micro-scale controls\u2026and mimic a site's predevelopment hydrology by using design techniques that infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate, and detain runoff close to its source. The result is a hydrologically functional landscape that generates less surface runoff, less pollution, less erosion, and less overall damage to lakes, streams, and coastal waters.\u201d (Low Impact Development Inc. www.lid-stormwater.net ). This design is one of many styles of catchment systems that exist around the world and we encourage you to explore the resources listed at the end of this report to learn more.\n_____________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________\nSYSTEM 1\nThis is a photo of a functioning roofwater harvesting system that utilizes the Brazilian Ball Pre-Filter (see illustration on previous page). This design uses an existing 1500-gallon fiberglass tank. There are many other tank options to consider (see resources). For specific details and explanation of how this pre-filter works, please refer to Illustrations 1 and 2. At this site the ground level at the bottom of the tank happens to sit at a higher elevation than the ground level of building itself. This small change in elevation is enough to create adequate, albeit low, water pressure for a simple kitchenette style sink and allows us to install the tank directly on the ground. This is ideal, as fewer resources are needed for this system, such as tower materials or electric pressure tanks.\n_____________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________\nThis is a photo of OAEC staff working with students of our August 2007 Roof water Catchment course to connect the pre-filter to the roof and tank lines. Note that we have chosen not to use PVC cement to hold the pre-filter, roof connector and overflow components together. Because the water is not under pressure, these components stay together well and do not leak. This allows for easy disassembly of the system for maintenance, if needed. Since these components are costly and have a large ecological footprint, it is nice to have the option to reuse the components in the future if this system is decommissioned or moved (handy for renters!). Finally, we can avoid exposing ourselves unnecessarily to the toxic fumes and residues left by PVC cement. PVC pipe was not our first choice for plumbing components as the process of manufacture and subsequent leaching from pipes into water can be toxic. A better alternative, that was not available to us at the time, is High Density Poly Ethylene (HDPE). These large diameter HDPE pipe and fittings tend to cost more than PVC of this size, though, it is less toxic over the long run to the health of the manufacturers and end users.\n_____________________________________________________\nHere is a photo if the inside of the top of the pre-filter and the ball that floats up and down to seal off the hole. See Illustration 1 for details on this process. It is important to find a ball that fits well and doesn\u2019t get stuck. We found this \u201cstage ball\u201d through a juggling supply company (see resources at the end of this document).\n_____________________________________________________\nThis image shows a close up of the downspout connection detail and the gutter with its wire screen covering. A standard rubber reducer with hose clamps was used to connect the rectangular downspout fitting to a 2\u201d PVC nipple. This slip nipple had to be cemented into the 90-degree elbow, as the fittings would not stay together otherwise. This is the one exception we made to our cement-free design (a threaded nipple would not require cement). The gutter screen shown here is one part of many steps in the pre-filtration and maintenance strategy used in this system. Notice the Douglas fir trees in the background of previous photos. These trees drop needles, branches and other debris that can clog and potentially contaminate the system. To avoid this, we implement a regimen that embodies the Permaculture principle of \u201cplanned redundancy.\u201d Every year before both the fire and the rainy seasons begin we sweep the roof clean and remove any accumulated debris from the bottom of the gutter. To prevent introduction of debris during the rainy season we have installed wire screen (or gutter guard) over the top of the gutter. We chose to use a metal gutter guard because it allows us to firmly secure it by bending it over the outside edge of the gutter. Some gutter guards are made of plastic and are designed to sit just inside the top edge of the gutter. These tend to collapse more easily allowing debris to get into the gutter. An additional wire screen has been installed in the bottom of the gutter at the outlet leading to the downspout to catch any debris that has made it past the top screen. All of these strategies act as pre-filters to the main Brazilian Ball pre-filter that is highlighted in this system. In potable systems it is worth the effort to employ multiple strategies for preventing organic matter from entering the tank because it reduces the need for cleaning the tank and the hassle of unclogging any fixtures downstream of the system.\n_____________________________________________________\nHere we have a photo of the roof, the associated gutter (or \u201ceaves trough\u201d for those who don\u2019t like the idea of drinking out of the \u201cgutter\u201d) and plumbing to tank. The painted steel roofing is one of the better choices for harvesting roof water because it does not contribute contaminants to the water (see resources at end to obtain more information on roofing choices). The skirt of the woodstove flashing (or roof jack) seen in the upper portion of this photo is made of lead, a heavy metal known to be toxic to humans. To avoid introducing lead to our drinking water, we have installed a piece of roofing over the gutter section that lies below this portion of the roof. This ensures that all rainwater falling on the lead skirt will run over the gutter, onto the ground and not enter into the drinking water tank. Notice that this system is collecting rain from only one side of the entire roof. Due to a 60-inch annual rainfall and the size of the one side of the roof (275 sq. ft.), we are easily able to fill the existing 1500-gallon tank to meet the annual drinking water needs of the users.\nWe use the rainwater calculator formula (see below) to calculate what amount of rainfall the roof water catchment system will capture and store. So, in this case, we have 275 sq. ft. roof (or catchment area) times 60 (our average annual rainfall) times 600 gallons divided by 1000 and we get 9,900 gallons of water that we can potentially collect and store. Because we are using an existing tank that holds only 1,500 gallons, we will not be able to store all of the rain that falls on this roof. The overflow will run into our rain garden instead (see next page). In fact, this size roof only takes ten inches of rain to fill the 1,500-gallon tank. To learn more go to www.rain-barrel.net/rainwater-calculator.html .\nRAINWATER CALCULATOR\nA = catchment area of building (square footage of roof)\nR = annual inches of rainfall\nG = total amount of collected rainwater\nA x R x 600 gallons / 1000 = G\nExample: 275 sq. ft. roof x 60 inches x 600 gallons divided by 1000 = 9,900 gallons of water that can potentially be captured and stored.\nClick here to download a roofwater harvesting capacity calculator spreadsheet (41 KB).\n_______________________________________________________\nRoof water harvesting systems need to be designed to handle overflow when the tank gets full. Rather than let this precious water run away, we have plumbed the tank overflow pipe and Brazilian Ball Pre-Filter to empty into a rain garden down the slope. A rain garden in this case is an excavated depression with a downhill berm. The shape allows for the excess roof run-off to form a temporary pool of water during the storm event. After the storm, the water slowly infiltrates into the soil helping to recharge shallow groundwater, reduce run-off and associated erosion and create some habitat for wildlife and native plants.\n_______________________________________________________\nOne goal of the WATER Institute is to help educate and inspire individuals to implement water saving ideas in their own homes and communities. We were heartened to see the level of interest shown by the 32 attendees of our sold-out Roof Water Harvesting class held in August 2007. The more we as citizens and communities chose to implement these water saving strategies the more we contribute to water security and the restoration and protection of water-stressed ecosystems.\n_______________________________________________________\nThe silky smoothness and quality of this rainwater is a just reward for working to secure a healthful supply of water.\n_______________________________________________________\nSYSTEM 2\nHere we have a different building that utilizes a similar roof water harvesting system. Here too the roof is metal and only one side (100 sq. ft.) is being used to feed the system. In this case, the low elevation of the gutter in the rear of the building precluded us from hooking it up because the tank would have to be placed so low that there would not be adequate pressure in this gravity fed system to supply a sink at waist height. This system uses a different strategy for connecting the PVC pipe to the downspout hook-up on the screened metal gutter. A 3\u201d PVC elbow is held in place with plumbing tape that is screwed into the fascia. This elbow has a reducer where it joins with the 2\u201d PVC pipe that carries the water to the tank. The amount of water that comes off of this smaller roof surface is still plenty to fill the 200-gallon tank and supply the drinking water needs of the user. Based on the formula mentioned in the description of system 1 can you figure out how much water this system yields in a 60\u201d annual rainfall year?\n_______________________________________________________\nIn this system, the site where we wanted to locate the tank slopes downward behind the building. To ensure adequate water pressure, we built a tower to raise the height of the tank. In areas that are seismically active, it is important to secure the tank to the platform.\n_______________________________________________________\nIn this close up you can see the \u00bd\u201d clear tubing we are using as a water level gauge. This is helpful in a system where the tank is harder to reach as you can see the water level without having to climb up the tower. It is also helpful in systems with smaller storage tanks, as you may have to monitor levels more often and adjust use accordingly. Please note that this kind of gauge works best if it is not exposed to direct sunlight. The sunlight can cause algae to grow in the tube and thus affect the water quality.\n_______________________________________________________\nA close up of what the water level looks like in the gauge. The height of this line corresponds with the height of the water level in the tank.\n_______________________________________________________\nAnother happy roof water harvester! In the future, this system will be plumbed directly into the building.\n_______________________________________________________\nBRAZILIAN INSPIRATION\nThis photo depicts a system located deep in the interior of the Amazon at Instituto Permacultura da Amazonia\u2019s (IPA) jungle center in Boa Vista do Ramos. IPA is a project of the non-profit Permacultura America Latina (PAL) founded by Ali Sharif. As stated on PAL\u2019s website, www.permacultura.org , \u201cPAL supports grassroots sustainable development initiatives and low impact economic practices in poor and indigenous communities throughout Latin America. PAL manages and provides technical and financial support to affiliated permaculture schools and demonstration centers in Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Guatemala. IPA was formed in 1997 in Manaus, Brazil, as the result of an initiative backed by the United Nations Development Program and the Ministry of Agriculture\u2026and was created to establish a sustainable farm and initiate a complementary permaculture education program.\u201d Notice that the tank is elevated on a tower to optimize gravity fed water pressure. This is made possible by the high elevation of the two-story roof.\n_______________________________________________________\nThis house boat (called a flutuante) is floating on 3 massive logs (each 5 feet in diameter). It has a solar system for electricity, a roofwater catchment system for water, an aquaculture system attached to the sides and a store on board. The flutuante will be used as a floating Permaculture classroom for the community in and around Boa Vista do Ramos.\n_______________________________________________________\nHere\u2019s a painting of a typical roofwater harvesting system with the Brazilian Ball Pre-Filter found amongst Brazilian Permaculture practitioners. This educational illustration is painted directly on the Ferro cement tank. This particular system is located at Instituto Permacultura do Cerrado (IPEC) in Pirenopolis (in central Brazil near Brasilia). As noted on PAL\u2019s website ( www.permacultura.org ), \u201cIPEC was established in 1999 to create the second permaculture reference center planned for Brazil. Since breaking ground on this fifty acre parcel a panorama of natural building techniques, renewable energies, food production and a well established level of community participation have made IPEC a unique example of sustainable development in South America.\u201d\n_______________________________________________________\nThis is a full view of the same kind of roofwater system, also located at IPEC. Notice that the bottom of the pre-filter has only a cap and is supported by loose bricks. To flush the system, one simply pulls away the brick and pulls of the cap. While this is a reasonable and inexpensive strategy, we chose to integrate the outflow of the pre-filter and the tank overflow into a single pipe leading to a rain garden to make use of the excess water. The tank is hand-made of Ferro cement, a common technique used throughout the world (see Art Ludwig\u2019s Water Storage: Tanks, Cisterns, Aquifers and Ponds \u00a9 2005 for detailed description and plans).\n_______________________________________________________\nThis is a full view of the same kind of roofwater system, also located at IPEC.

Before you get started, there are things to consider. We lay out these considerations with the hope that you will further research and use the resources we have provided to make your own informed decisions and that the information presented here will empower you to work with officials to get these kinds of systems approved.\n\u2022 Existing Rainwater Codes - First and foremost you will want to find out if there are any existing policies or ordinances in your city, county and or state that regulate the use of rainwater. In many cases, if you are serviced by municipal water supply, they are going to want you to use a backflow prevention device, especially if you are plumbing your rainwater into the same system. These devices cost in the hundreds of dollars to install and require annual inspections by qualified inspectors (see the On Tap Magazine listed in the resources to learn more about cross-connection contamination). Some municipalities require you to install a backflow prevention device even if you only have stand-alone rain barrels attached to your gutters that will be used for irrigation only. We find this requirement does not give much incentive to use rainwater and we hope that other jurisdictions do not follow their example. We encourage you to look at the examples we have given under Rainwater Catchment Policy Resources at the end of this booklet to learn more about the progressive policies that are being enacted in water scarce areas around the world and work with your local representative to create similar policies in your own city or county.\n\u2022 Building Safely \u2013 As with any building project, it is important to take steps to ensure that your design is safe. Water is VERY heavy (8.35 pounds/gallon) and it is worthwhile to pay professionals to review your plans and even install your system if you do not have the skills to design and build it safely yourself. Certain designs require approval from the Building Department. Check to see what requirements your city or county have regarding tank construction (i.e. ferrocement) or installation of prefabricated tanks (especially if you are placing it on a platform or tower and live in a seismically active area). Not all building departments are familiar with ferrocement tank design and we encourage you to take this opportunity to educate your building department officials about how these tanks work and offer examples of those that are currently being approved in many counties across the US.\n\u2022 To Drink or Not To Drink \u2013 It is important to think about what you will be using this rainwater for. If you are going to want to drink this water, you will want to test it to determine what is in it and at what level. Rainwater is comparable in quality to any privately sourced water (springs and wells). Both often both test positive for general coliforms. These are different than fecal coliform or E. coli (both of which can cause harm). The presence of general coliforms indicates that the water has come into contact with organic matter (plant or animal) and does not guarantee that the water will cause illness. However, the drinking water standard requires that NO coliform be present. While some drink untreated rainwater, it is up to each individual to decide whether s/he wants to take this risk. You can eliminate general coliforms through various means (boiling the water for one minute, chlorinating, using an Ultra-Violet purification system, etc.) and we recommend that you consider doing so if you have any concerns, are ill or have compromised immunity. There are several resources online that talk about what coliform bacteria are, how to treat for them, the pros and cons of treatment regimens and why these coliforms are perceived as a risk (see the resource list in the back of this report).\n_______________________________________________________\nRESOURCES\nThe following is a list of websites, tax incentives, reports and publications for rainwater catchment systems legislation, policy guidelines, design and installation.

You imagine a building camouflaged by dense bush, perhaps, overlooking a dam or a reservoir in the Waitakeres. But the upmarket suburb is the location for Watercare Services\u2019 new corporate headquarters and you can find Mike Foley, its CIO, in the former Mercury Energy building; an open-plan office accommodating 200 people from operations, asset development, IS and corporate finance.\nFoley sees Nuffield Street as a fresh start for Watercare. Operations and management had previously been spread across two sites in Onehunga and the Auckland CBD.\nOne effect of relocation for this least-cost service provider is cultural change: \u201cWe had a canteen in Onehunga where you could get lunch for six dollars. In Newmarket you\u2019re lucky if can get a coffee for four dollars,\u201d he says, ruefully. But it\u2019s Watercare\u2019s business \u2014 delivering clean, grade-A water to 1.2 million people \u2014 that is more likely to be keeping Foley awake than the product of the nearest Starbucks. \u201cIt sounds simple, but there are a lot of processes behind it,\u201d he says, suggesting a trip to the treatment plant to show me the sewage outfall and what he diplomatically describes as \u201cthe result\u201d of the organisation\u2019s efforts. I politely decline.\n\u201cYou turn on the tap and expect the water to come out and don\u2019t even think about where it goes,\u201d he says, clearly resigned to such public ignorance. \u201cBut if you think about what we do, we affect the whole of the Auckland region. If we get it really wrong, we affect approximately 1.2 million people within several hours, and that\u2019s always in the back of my mind \u2014 it\u2019s a 24-hour a day, 365-day a year operation.\u201d\nWhy pay for rain?\nThe lack of public appreciation must frustrate the suppliers of this essential service no end. Watercare\u2019s customers are local network operators and, as a 2005 AC Nielsen survey into the quality of its relationship with the public points out, the network operators have a limited understanding of the end user. Ask, for instance, if they think their water company is well-managed and you might find the odd ratepayer who doesn\u2019t want Auckland to take its water from the Waikato: \u201cI don\u2019t like the water quality and taste\u201d. Responses to a question about whether Watercare can be trusted include: \u201cWhy should we pay for something that comes out of the sky?\u201d Yet only about 12 per cent of respondents think their water company is not well-managed, and only 16 per cent say they do not consider it trustworthy. An impressive 77 per cent are satisfied with the water supply to their homes.\nA mature industry, then, with customers who might not value the service but who also tend to be uncritical of it until the product stops running. So I ask Foley whether he had anything akin to a \u2018Eureka moment\u2019 for Watercare\u2019s future IS strategy. He laughs. \u201cIt was more of a \u2018Jesus Christ what have I got myself into?\u2019 moment.\u201d Before Foley\u2019s appointment, the responsibility for IS delivery lay with an IT manager who now works for the organisation in another role. Foley says it\u2019s the first time he has ever been in a situation where an incumbent manager has had a new executive appointed over him. The situation contributed to a culture of doubt in the IS team. \u201cThe fear that everybody had when I first joined was, \u2018Will we all still have a job?\u2019 But why would I want to get rid of a team of people that has been here and who understands this organisation better than I did?\u201d\nGood point, and it\u2019s a pity more managers don\u2019t think that way. Foley not only kept his team, he added to it, and his previous work in similar utilities helped him to clarify a five-year strategy using the resources at his disposal. Within the first 10 months, Foley replaced Watercare\u2019s PC, DOS-based payroll and HR system with some application service provider-based software he outsourced to a third party. As Foley says understatedly, \u201cThat\u2019s one not to get wrong.\u201d\nThe big move\nTowards the end of 2006, Watercare relocated. But it was far from a straightforward office move: The continuity of Auckland\u2019s water supply depended on the new system being operational before the old one was taken off-stream. This required a joint effort between IS, the control systems team and operations to ensure continued availability. \u201cThe plan was that at 8am on 9 October 2006 we had to be fully operational in the new location. Along with the usual systems and infrastructure, we had to relocate operations. We have a 24-hour, 365-day-a-year control centre that can\u2019t go offline. We have a back-up, but we can\u2019t lose it.\u201d\nExecutives hear war stories about failed projects and over-budget IT implementations. \u201cThey\u2019re always conscious that IT projects have the potential to fail if there isn\u2019t a strong governance model applied to manage them,\u201d says Foley. While a large part of his job involves persuading senior colleagues that investment in technology is worthwhile, he also has to ensure that once the investment is made, it is sustained. \u201cYou can\u2019t just buy it once and that\u2019s it; you have to maintain that expenditure. It\u2019s a continual process of enhancement and update. A CIO has to maintain the repeat business.\u201d\nWithin the overarching relocation programme there were other projects that were critical to its overall delivery. For example, Foley outsourced server management to a third party. There was a migration of diverse PC operating systems to Microsoft XP. The IS team also implemented a new wide area network between the data centre, one of Watercare\u2019s main treatment sites and Nuffield Street. And a couple of months before the move Foley\u2019s team oversaw a changeover of the phones to voice over IP. \u201cWe brought in VoIP early because it was one less thing to think about when we got here. Where we could take the risk away, we did. We took away a lot of the physical desk phones, implemented the Vodafone Integrated Talk-zone solution and linked the mobile number to the DDIs.\u201d\nEveryone moved into Watercare\u2019s new premises on the Monday morning as though it was just another working day \u2014 the kind of dream transition that would turn many chief executives green with envy, and even when pressed on whether it really went so smoothly, Foley says there were just 20 service desk calls that first day. \u201cEverybody could log in, had email and a phone system. We were fully operational as of Saturday at 4pm. We were in there again on Monday morning, waiting for people. If there were any small issues we dealt with them then.\u201d\nThe success of the relocation may even have helped erase management perceptions that IS was a black hole. \u201cThere were quite a few shocked faces on the day we moved in \u2014 that at eight o\u2019clock in the morning they could already operate without any problems,\u201d says Foley. \u201cWe did what we said we were going to do in a structured process.\u201d\nGary Swift, Watercare\u2019s general manager finance, validates the exceptional work of Foley and the IS team.\n\u201cThese projects represented a \u2018sea change\u2019 in Watercare\u2019s computer and telephone systems; the most significant IS change since the company was established, in fact,\u201d says Swift.\n\u201c Mike\u2019s background and experience meant he was ideally suited to lead this change. The execution of the projects \u2014 a combination of up-skilled existing IS staff, new staff and some specialist contractors \u2014 was planned to a very high degree. The fact that there were no problems on the day we moved into our new premises reflects Mike and his team\u2019s commitment, skills and planning. They can be justly very proud of their achievements.\u201d\nA multifaceted experience\nFoley says he comes from \u201ca typical development-into-management background\u201d. As well, Foley\u2019s multifaceted experiences throughout his career are all proving useful in his current role. His brother enjoys ribbing him about having worked in all five vices: \u201cGambling, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and as a consultant, according to him, I was a \u2018prostitute\u2019 selling to the highest paying client.\u201d\nHe worked in London on production planning systems; moved into telecommunications with what was then Mercury and is now Cable & Wireless; then brewing with Budweiser; before going into management consultancy, working in supply chain, customer management and plant production management. He relocated to New Zealand in December 1999 to run the Siebel practice for what was then Ernst & Young, before being headhunted by Deloitte to set up and run its customer relationship management practice. Deloitte eventually commandeered Foley\u2019s team to work for Telstra, consolidating its customer service solutions, and wanted to move it permanently to Melbourne. \u201cSurprisingly enough, none of my team wanted to live in Australia, so we went our separate ways.\u201d\nFoley joined Sky City as business solutions manager before being appointed CIO of Watercare two years ago. His consultancy engagements have given him a breadth of experience from a number of countries and industries that he can now translate to Watercare. \u201cSome of the best things I\u2019ve seen were not in the industry I was working in at the time. You borrow them. The best customer management process I ever reviewed was actually in a pizza company.\u201d Foley applied that knowledge to an engagement he had as a telecommunications consultant.\n\u201c Mike is a no-nonsense type of guy,\u201d says a former colleague, Deloitte partner Keith N. McArley. \u201cHe has an enquiring mind and approaches all problem-solving in a structured and orderly manner.\u201d\nPlan for the worst, deliver the best\nThis skill set provides Foley an edge when dealing with a major part of his role as Watercare CIO \u2014 strategising for a disaster. The threat of avian flu last year caused Watercare to re-examine how it could securely supply water during a crisis. Plans also exist for many other types of civil disaster and large-scale emergency. \u201cYou have this differential between classic business systems, financials and asset management, and the control systems that monitor flow and pressure. If we lose those systems, then we have to fully man the plant 24x7, which has a huge impact on how we operate.\u201d\nOf the relationship between business and IS, two years into the role, Foley says it\u2019s now about business priorities. He mentions attending a recent CIO lunch, at which he noted Fonterra CIO Greg James\u2019s remark that there is no such thing as an ICT project. \u201cI firmly agree,\u201d says Foley. \u201cWe can facilitate, drive and manage it once we have chosen the right product and the capex signed off. But the business has to justify, select and review what they want and how they want it to work.\u201d\nFor Foley, service culture and \u201crepeat business\u201d are perennial themes: \u201cIt\u2019s all about them, not about IS.\u201d \u007f\nAbout Watercare\nWatercare Services is New Zealand\u2019s largest water and wastewater company. It supplies water to six retailers (Metrowater, North Shore City Council, Manukau Water, United Water, Rodney District Council and Waitakere City Council), which in turn supply it to Auckland consumers. The company supplies an average of 347,000 cubic metres of water daily, drawn from 12 sources: 10 dams, the Waikato River and Onehunga aquifer (a layer of rock through which groundwater flows to supply wells and springs). Watercare also operates a regional wastewater network for four of the region\u2019s councils. It treats on average 288,000 cubic metres of wastewater a day at Mangere\u2019s wastewater treatment plant. Watercare is owned by the city and district councils of Auckland, Manukau, North Shore, Waitakere, Papakura and Rodney. The owners appoint a shareholders\u2019 representative group, which in turn appoints Watercare\u2019s board of directors and determines objectives.\nLocal News\n"}, {"score": 1461.0547, "uuid": "49959cfd-5467-5a2e-a2a7-48647941dd23", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0606wb-31-01239", "target_hostname": "www.townoflakelure.com", "target_uri": "http://www.townoflakelure.com/water_conservation.htm", "page_rank": 1.1781727e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>Water</em> Conservation", "snippet": "Use drip irrigation to apply <em>water</em> slowly exactly where it <em>is</em> needed.

In most areas of the country water has been readily available, but this situation is changing. There are constantly new demands on our water supply. Sometimes that supply may be less than other times because of climatic conditions such as a drought, a disaster, or just a breakdown in the water system.\nConserving water also conserves other resources: energy and money. It costs money to pump water and make it available in our homes, for irrigation, and for business and industrial uses. Energy is required to pump, move, and to purify water. Both energy and money are required to heat water, whether it is the water we heat and use, or the water we heat and waste through poor management practices.\nBy becoming more aware of your water use habits, you can reduce water consumption, eliminate waste, and save energy and money.\nHow much water do you use in a day? A gallon? Do you use 25, 50, or even 100 or more gallons? Few people know how much they use. Studies show wide variation in the amount of water used by rural and urban households. Water use ranges form 66 to 118 gallons per person per day, with urban households using larger amounts.\nImagine what it would be like to turn on the tap and not get a drop of water. People in some parts of the country know this does happen. They are learning how to conserve water. They know that water is a limited resource. Water shortages are now a local or regional problem. Some day they may be a national problem. It is wise to learn now how to conserve water.\nThe following checklist is designed to help you see how effectively you are using water, and to alert you to ways to save. As you read this list, check the steps you have already taken to conserve water. Note what you still need to do to become a better manager of water resources.\nWater Conservation Checklist :\n- Test for a leaking toilet by adding food coloring to the tank. If any color appears in the bowl after 30 minutes, your toilet is leaking. Leaking toilets waste 200 gallons of water a day.\n- Use water conserving plumbing fixtures and water flow constrictors on sinks and showers. If you don\u2019t have a low-flow toilet, place two half-gallon plastic bottles filled with water in your toilet tank. This saves one gallon of water each time you flush.\n- Run your dishwasher and wash clothes only when you have a full load.\n- Take short showers instead of a bath. Baths can use 30 to 50 gallons of water. Showers use 5 gallons of water per minute, less if flow constrictor is installed.\n- Check your water meter while no water is being used. If the dials are moving then you have a water leak.\n- Don\u2019t run water continuously when washing dishes, brushing your teeth, washing your hands and face, or shaving.\n- Store drinking water in the refrigerator to avoid trying to run it cool at the tap.\n- Avoid using a garbage disposal. Disposals use a great deal of water. Add your garbage to the compost or trash instead of putting it down the garbage disposal.\n- Choose plants that are native to the area you live or plants that are drought resistant for landscaping and gardens. Native plants are use to the natural amount of precipitation that occurs in the area they found and normally do not require any additional watering. This known as Xeriscaping.is\n- Water lawns and gardens during the coolest part of the day and only when grass shows signs of withering. Use drip irrigation to apply water slowly exactly where it is needed. Collect rain from the gutter system on a house in a rain barrel to use for watering.\n- Use a bucket of water and a spray head on the hose to wash your car. A running hose waste over 100 gallons of water in the time it takes to \u00a0\u00a0 wash a car.\n****JavaScript based drop down DHTML menu generated by NavStudio.

Here are a few things you can do to conserve water at home and help ease the impact of the drought.\nFix leaky faucets and plumbing joints. Saves 20 gallons per day for every leak stopped\nTurn off the water while brushing your teeth. Saves three gallons each day.\nTurn off the water while shaving. Fill the bottom of the sink with a few inches of water to rinse your razor. Saves three gallons each day.\nShorten your showers. Even a one or two-minute reduction can save up to 700 gallons per month.\nDon't use your toilet as an ashtray or wastebasket. Saves 400 to 600 gallons per month.\nCapture tap water. While you wait for hot water to come down the pipes, catch the flow in a watering can to use later on house plants or your garden. Saves 200 to 300 gallons per month.\nRun only full loads in the washing machine and dishwasher. Can save 300 to 800 gallons per month.\nIf you wash dishes by hand, don't leave the water running for rinsing. If you have two sinks, fill one with rinse water. If you only have one sink, use a spray device or short blasts instead of letting the water run. Saves 200 to 500 gallons a month.\nWhen washing dishes by hand, use the least amount of detergent possible. This minimizes rinse water needed. Saves 50 to 150 gallons a month.\nKeep a bottle of drinking water in the refrigerator. This beats the wasteful habit of running tap water to cool it for drinking. Saves 200 to 300 gallons a month.\nDon't defrost frozen foods with running water. Either plan ahead by placing frozen items in the refrigerator overnight or defrost them in the microwave. Saves 50 to 150 gallons a month.\nDon't let the faucet run while you clean vegetables. Rinse them in a filled sink or pan. Saves 150 to 250 gallons a month.\nUse the garbage disposal less and the garbage can more (even better, compost!). Saves 50 to 150 gallons a month.\nWater your lawn only when it needs it. Step on your grass; If it springs back when you lift your foot, it doesn't need water. Set your sprinklers for more days in between watering. Saves 750-1,500 gallons per month.\nDon't water the sidewalks, driveway or gutter. Adjust your sprinklers so that water lands on your lawn or garden where it belongs \u2013 and only there. Saves 500 gallons per month.\nPut a layer of mulch around trees and plants. Chunks of bark, peat moss or gravel slows down evaporation. Saves 750 to 1,500 gallons a month.\nWater plants during the cool parts of the day. Early morning is better than dusk since it helps prevent the growth of fungus. Saves 300 gallons.\nDon't water the lawn on windy days. There's too much evaporation. Can waste up to 300 gallons in one watering.\nCut down watering on cool and overcast days and don't water in the rain. Adjust or deactivate automatic sprinklers. Can save up to 300 gallons each time.\nSet lawn mower blades one notch higher. Longer grass means less evaporation. Saves 500 to 1,500 gallons each month.\nUse a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways and sidewalks. Saves 150 gallons or more each time. At once a week, that's more than 600 gallons a month.\nDon't run the hose while washing your car. Use a bucket of water and a quick hose rinse at the end. Saves 150 gallons each time.\nIf you have a pool, use a pool cover to cut down on evaporation. It will also keep your pool cleaner and reduce the need to add chemicals.

Here are a few things you can do to conserve water at home and help ease the impact of the drought.\nFix leaky faucets and plumbing joints. Saves 20 gallons per day for every leak stopped\nTurn off the water while brushing your teeth. Saves three gallons each day.\nTurn off the water while shaving. Fill the bottom of the sink with a few inches of water to rinse your razor. Saves three gallons each day.\nShorten your showers. Even a one or two-minute reduction can save up to 700 gallons per month.\nDon't use your toilet as an ashtray or wastebasket. Saves 400 to 600 gallons per month.\nCapture tap water. While you wait for hot water to come down the pipes, catch the flow in a watering can to use later on house plants or your garden. Saves 200 to 300 gallons per month.\nRun only full loads in the washing machine and dishwasher. Can save 300 to 800 gallons per month.\nIf you wash dishes by hand, don't leave the water running for rinsing. If you have two sinks, fill one with rinse water. If you only have one sink, use a spray device or short blasts instead of letting the water run. Saves 200 to 500 gallons a month.\nWhen washing dishes by hand, use the least amount of detergent possible. This minimizes rinse water needed. Saves 50 to 150 gallons a month.\nKeep a bottle of drinking water in the refrigerator. This beats the wasteful habit of running tap water to cool it for drinking. Saves 200 to 300 gallons a month.\nDon't defrost frozen foods with running water. Either plan ahead by placing frozen items in the refrigerator overnight or defrost them in the microwave. Saves 50 to 150 gallons a month.\nDon't let the faucet run while you clean vegetables. Rinse them in a filled sink or pan. Saves 150 to 250 gallons a month.\nUse the garbage disposal less and the garbage can more (even better, compost!). Saves 50 to 150 gallons a month.\nWater your lawn only when it needs it. Step on your grass; If it springs back when you lift your foot, it doesn't need water. Set your sprinklers for more days in between watering. Saves 750-1,500 gallons per month.\nDon't water the sidewalks, driveway or gutter. Adjust your sprinklers so that water lands on your lawn or garden where it belongs \u2013 and only there. Saves 500 gallons per month.\nPut a layer of mulch around trees and plants. Chunks of bark, peat moss or gravel slows down evaporation. Saves 750 to 1,500 gallons a month.\nWater plants during the cool parts of the day. Early morning is better than dusk since it helps prevent the growth of fungus. Saves 300 gallons.\nDon't water the lawn on windy days. There's too much evaporation. Can waste up to 300 gallons in one watering.\nCut down watering on cool and overcast days and don't water in the rain. Adjust or deactivate automatic sprinklers. Can save up to 300 gallons each time.\nSet lawn mower blades one notch higher. Longer grass means less evaporation. Saves 500 to 1,500 gallons each month.\nUse a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways and sidewalks. Saves 150 gallons or more each time. At once a week, that's more than 600 gallons a month.\nDon't run the hose while washing your car. Use a bucket of water and a quick hose rinse at the end. Saves 150 gallons each time.\nIf you have a pool, use a pool cover to cut down on evaporation. It will also keep your pool cleaner and reduce the need to add chemicals. Saves 1,000 gallons a month.\nHave an evaporative air conditioner? Direct the water drain line to a flower bed, tree base, or lawn.\nDrive your car onto a lawn to wash it. Rinse water can help water the grass.\nIf you allow your children to play in the sprinklers, make sure it's only when you're watering the yard.\n\u00a92009 City of Monrovia.

Water is a critically important resource, and recent news stories have really started to emphasise how carefully we need to look after it. Even in the UK, supposedly renowned for our rainy weather, we are suffering from a major drought. A very dry winter means that ground water supplies, which most of us rely on for our drinking water, have not been replenished leaving us with the very real prospect of running short. And don\u2019t be fooled by the recent rain \u2013 the National Farmers\u2019 Union say that \u2018several months\u2019 of steady rainfall is needed to relieve drought conditions.\nIn the Greenhouse, we have water butts that use rain water from our gutters for watering plants and for feeding the loos and hand basins. The toilets are \u2018dual flush\u2019 so that they use less water when you only do a wee. We provide tap water in the cafe for drinking, rather than bottled which has additional transportation impacts. At home, you can put a full bottle of water or a \u2018hippo\u2019 in your toilet cistern to reduce the amount of water (processed to drinking standards) that is needed to fill it and which gets literally flushed down the drain needlessly. There are some information leaflets on the right hand side of the website front page that will give you more ideas for saving water at home.\nWater in our food\nBut the water that comes out of our taps and down our loos, while critically important for the UK\u2019s water supplies, is only a small part of the story. Most of the water we use is embedded in the food we eat, and the products we buy: producing 1 kilo of beef for example consumes 15,000 litres of water while 1 kilo of wheat \u2019drinks up\u2019 1,500 litres. This means it is really important to buy seasonal, local and unprocessed food to minimise our water use. When a billion people in the world already live in chronic hunger and water resources are under pressure we should not pretend the problem is \u2018elsewhere\u2019. Coping with population growth and ensuring access to nutritious food to everyone call for a series of actions we can all help by:\nfollowing a healthier, sustainable diet\nconsuming less water-intensive products\nreducing the scandalous food wastage: 30% of the food produced worldwide is never eaten\nproducing more food, of better quality, with less water.\nPlease take a look at the website you\u2019ll be surprised by some of the facts, and whilst you think about what you can do, please take a moment to pass the information on.\n( http://www.unwater.org/worldwaterday/ ).\nLast Updated on Saturday, 17 March 2012 16:10\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 The Greenhouse Trust.

A leaking toilet can use 90,000 gallons of water in a month. Get out the wrench and change the washers on your sinks and showers, or get new washerless faucets. Keeping your existing equipment well maintained is probably the easiest and cheapest way to start saving water.\nInstall new fixtures\nNew, low-volume or dual flush toilets, low-flow showerheads, water-efficient dishwashers and clothes washing machines can all save a great deal of water and money. Aerators on your faucets can significantly reduce water volume; water-saving showerheads can cut the volume of water used down to 1.2 gallons per minute or less, and some even have a \"pause button\" to let you stop the water while soaping up or shampooing. Our interns recently pointed out that \"spending about $30 on low-flow showerheads and faucets is estimated to save 45 gallons of that 260 gallons of water [used in a typical household per day], almost 18% of your usage. Splurging on a low-flow toilet could save another 50-80 gallons of water a day. Together, those changes nearly cut in half the household's daily use, saving a considerable amount of water \u2013 and passing that savings on to your water bill, as well as your water heating bill.\"\nCultivate good water habits\nAll the water that goes down the drain, clean or dirty, ends up mixing with raw sewage, getting contaminated, and meeting the same fate. Try to stay aware of this precious resource disappearing and turn off the water while brushing your teeth or shaving and always wash laundry and dishes with full loads. When washing dishes by hand, fill up the sink and turn off the water. Take shorter showers or, as the old joke goes, shower with a friend: Treehugger TV shows you how. To put things in perspective, take a quick look at your next water bill when it arrives. It probably won't be costing you too much, but the average household consumes multiple thousands of gallons each month. See if you can make this number go down. If you're the graphing type, go nuts.\nStay off the bottle\nBy many measures, bottled water is a scam. In most first-world countries, the tap water is provided by a government utility and is tested regularly. (You can look up your water in the National Tap Water Quality Database) Taste tests have shown that in many municipalities, tap water actually tastes better. Bottled water is not as well regulated and studies have shown that it is not even particularly pure. A four-year study of bottled water in the U.S. conducted by NRDC found that one-fifth of the 103 water products tested contained synthetic organic chemicals such as the neurotoxin xylene and the possible carcinogen and neurotoxin styrene. (Grist) Much bottled water doesn\"t come from a \"Artesian springs\" and is just tap water anyhow. (Coca-Cola adds salt to its Dasani water to make it taste better, just like fast food.) Not only is it more expensive per gallon than gasoline, bottled water incurs a huge carbon footprint from its transportation, and the discarded bottles are a blight. It's no wonder that some people even think it\u2019s a sin. If you want to carry your water with you, get a bottle and fill it. (Look here for some advise on durable, non-toxic container options.) If your water at home tastes funny, try an activated charcoal or ceramic filter. Here is a comparison of home-use water filters from Grist.\nGo beyond the lawn\nNaturalize it using locally appropriate plants that are hardy and don't need a lot of water. If you have to water, do it during the coolest part of the day or at night to minimize evaporation. Here is a useful calculator to figure out landscape water use. Xeriscaping is a method of landscaping that utilizes only native and low water plants. It is an especially appropriate approach for states like California and Arizona where people often plant lawns like they live in Florida despite living in the desert.\nHarvest your rainwater\nPut a rain barrel on your downspouts and use this water for irrigation. Rain cisterns come in all shapes and sizes ranging from larger underground systems to smaller, freestanding ones. Some even glow!\nHarvest your greywater\nWater that has been used at least once but is still clean enough for other jobs is called greywater. Water from sinks, showers, dishwashers, and clothes washers are the most common household examples. (Toilet water is often called \"blackwater\" and needs a different level of treatment before it can be reused.) Greywater can be recycled with practical plumbing systems like the Aqus, or with simple practices such as emptying the fish tank in the garden instead of the sink. The bottom line? One way or another, avoid putting water down the drain when you can use it for something else.\nAt the car wash\nCar washes are often more efficient than home washing and treat their water rather than letting it straight into the sewer system. But check to make sure that they clean and recycle the water. Better yet, try the waterless car wash. If you live in Manchester, the Levenshulme Baptist Church is recycling water from its Baptistery pool for charity car washes http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/baptismal_water.php .\nKeep your eyes open\nReport broken pipes, open hydrants, and excessive waste. Don't be shy about pointing out leaks to your friends and family members, either. They might have tuned out the dripping sound a long time ago.\nDon't spike the punch\nWater sources have to be protected. In many closed loop systems like those in cities around the Great Lakes, waste water is returned to the Lake that fresh water comes out of. Don't pour chemicals down drains, or flush drugs down toilets; it could come back in diluted form in your water.\nWater Conservation Facts: By the Numbers\n2.5 gallons: The amount of water per person much of the world is allocated.\u2028 400 gallons: The amount of water per person used by the average American citizen; 30 percent of this is used for outdoor purposes, such as watering the lawn.\u2028 70 percent: The amount of worldwide water use that is allocated to farming; most of these farming irrigation systems operate at only 40 percent efficiency. According to a 2002 article by Lester Brown, aquifers are depleting all over the world\u2014in China by 2-3 metres per year. In the US, the Ogallala aquifer is shrinking rapidly. In India, aquifers are going down by 3 metres per year, in Mexico by 3.3 meters per year.\u2028 263: The number of rivers that either cross or demarcate international political boundaries, in addition to countless aquifers. According to the Atlas of International Freshwater Agreement, 90 percent of countries in the world must share these water basins with at least one or two other states. Major conflicts such as Darfur have been connected to water shortages, and lack of access to clean water.\u2028 1430: Gallons of water per capita in the United States; only 100 gallons of that is household use per person as most is used for agriculture, according to water expert Peter Gleick.\u2028 88 percent: Of deaths from diarrhea are caused from unsafe drinking water, inadequate availability of water for hygiene, and lack of access to sanitation; this translates to more than 1.5 million of the 1.9 million children under five who perish from diarrhea each year. This amounts to 18% of all under-five deaths and means that more than 4,000 children are dying every day as a result of diarrhoeal diseases.\u2028 $11.3 billion: The amount of money required to provide basic levels of service for drinking and waste water in Africa and Asia.\u2028 $35 billion: the amount of money spent on bottled water in the most developed countries in the world.\u2028 1.5 million: Barrels of crude oil used for making PET water bottles, globally. This is enough oil to fuel 100,000 American cars for a year.\u2028 2.7 tons: The amount of plastic used to bottle water. 86 percent become garbage or litter.\nWater Conservation: Getting Techie\nWhere does it come from?\u2028The water cycle is the process by which water circulates around, over, and through the Earth. It is driven by the sun, evaporating water from the oceans, rising through the atmosphere and condensing as pure water or snow. About 505,000 cubic kilometers of water fall on the earth each year, 398,000 over the oceans. The pure water is stored as ice, as water in lakes, and in aquifers that have taken thousands of years to fill. 97% of water is stored in the oceans; 2% in the ice caps; only 1% is in lakes, groundwater or other useable sources. We draw on surface water (lakes and rivers) subsurface (groundwater through pumping) and a small amount is made (very expensively) through desalination. Read more about the water cycle at Wikipedia.\nWhat is done to it?\u2028Sometimes very little. Where the water sources are pure, like in New York City, very little is actually necessary. Other municipalities put their water through a three stage system of Primary Treatment (collecting and screening), Secondary Treatment (removal of solids and contaminants using filters and coagulation), and Tertiary Treatment (carbon filtering and disinfection). It is then stored in reservoirs or water towers so that it can be gravity-fed through the system.\nIs it really pure?\u2028While the consensus is that, overall, tap water is better than bottled water for you and the environment, there are some concerns. Older houses and apartment buildings may have lead plumbing which can contaminate it via pipes, solder, and old brass fittings. There is also a growing convern about low levels of antibiotics from agriculture and people disposing of medication down the toilet. Gender-bender hormones from birth control pills, along with phthalates from vinyl, are entering the water system and changing the sex of fish http://www.raysapoint.com/contra.html , lowering the sperm count of men, and doubling the number of annual male breast reduction surgeries.\nWhere does it go?\u2028Too often, waster is just dumped. Often it enters combined systems that are overwhelmed when it rains. Where there is sewage treatment it is of variable quality, but a properly run modern plant can produce results that are fairly effective. The systems are designed to mimic natural treatment processes where bacteria consume the organic contaminants, and it can then be returned to lakes or as groundwater. Unfortunately, in sub-Saharan Africa almost no waste water is treated; in Latin America only about 15% is. The price is paid in diarrhea, typhus and cholera.\nHow to Save Water: From the Archives\nDig deeper into these articles on Water from the TreeHugger and Planet Green archives.\nThe secret to saving water is a synthesis of good practices and good design. Keep an eye on the the TreeHugger archives for the latest methods and technologies. Toilets\nDual-flush options are available from Caroma, and numerous others. This Argentine toilet design lets the sink water do the flushing. Here we have a link to a review of low-flow toilets To learn about test methodology for low-flow toilets (you\u2019ll never guess) and the results of the rigorous trials, look here (test results here). Composting toilets that TreeHugger has covered include the Bio-lux, a pricey Japanese throne. Here you\u2019ll find a review of more composting toilet options. The Propelair uses vacuum action to flush itself. The Athena replacement handle saves water by controlling flush quantity. Waterless urinals are made by many companies now, including Falcon and Waterless, and look here for a case study of the water saving potential of flushless urinals. The TwoFlush can turn any standard toilet into a dual flush fixture.\u2028 Clothes washers\nLG\u2019s steam cleaning, front loading clothes washer boasts 35% less water consumption than a conventional model.

And if you have a tendency to lose yourself in the moment, a shower timer might also be a good idea.\nWater heating\nPoint of use water heaters save water by delivering hot water almost immediately rather than making you wait for it while the tap runs. Some even use microwaves, and this Thermostatic fixture cuts the waiting time and looks sharp in the process. More solid tips on greener water heating can be found here.\nPurifying water\nSee some of the neat developments in water purification for third world communities, including the LifeStraw, the UV Tube, the coffeground water filter. It has even been suggested to make water filters from old tires. Before he segwayed into transportation, Dean Kamen developed a water purifier: \"If you could take all the diseases you could name, 80 percent would be wiped out if you just gave people clean water.\" Hydro-Dis is a new three-stage disinfection system from Australia; Julie Frost, an Australian student, developed a clever pasteurization tool. To learn more about your city\u2019s water quality, check out National Tapwater Database.\nBottled water\nIf you have your doubts about the harm of everyday bottled water, wait until you see our coverage of strange waters: water that makes you skinny, water for dogs, water that is sung to and infused with good intentions, and water with gold in it. Some bottled waters like Biota and Jivita are now using containers made from cornstarch, also known as polylactic acid (PLA). While these are non-petroleum products and are, in theory biodegradable, they are not recyclable and most likely will never break down in your backyard compost pile. Some companies like Ethos and HtoO are doing constructive things with their profits, but they still are responsible for the many ecological impacts of bottled water.\nWhere to Get Water Conservation Products\nLow-flow showerheads and sink aerators\nGreenfeet Pristine Planet Eartheasy shop Gaiam Showerhead store\u2028 Dual-flush toilets\nTwoflush retrofit system Caroma dual flush toilets TotoUSA\u2028 Appliances\nENERGY STAR Dishwashers ENERGY STAR Clothes Washers\nThis page is taken from http://planetgreen.discovery.com/\n"}, {"score": 1439.406, "uuid": "3d74f477-269e-53d5-a9df-d103176336ef", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0611wb-74-09326", "target_hostname": "www.waterefficiency.net", "target_uri": "http://www.waterefficiency.net/WE/articles/3663.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1863098e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "<em>Water</em> Task Force | Articles | <em>Water</em> Efficiency", "snippet": "The <em>water</em> <em>is</em> then placed in two-gallon blue Rubbermaid containers with spouts in every bathroom in the building and <em>is</em> used <em>for</em> hand washing.", "explanation": null, "document": "November-December 2008\nWater Task Force\nUniversity of Georgia recently created a program to reduce water use and conserve water over a sustained period of time.\nCopy and Paste This Permanent Link:\nPhoto: @iStockphoto.com/cinoby\nComments\nThe current drought affecting Georgia and much of the Southeast began in 2006 and dramatically worsened in late 2007, resulting in area stream flows and reservoirs dropping precipitously.

In one lab on campus, all it took was a little ingenuity, hoses, and buckets to save 1,000 gallons a month. Deb Carter, lab manager at Aruna Biomedical located in the campus\u2019 Rhodes Animal Science Center, didn\u2019t want to see water used in the lab\u2019s filter systems wasted, so when she learned that the water the systems discharged was clean tap water, she connected the discharge hose to another hose to route the water into buckets and, later, barrels, instead of down the drain. The water is then placed in two-gallon blue Rubbermaid containers with spouts in every bathroom in the building and is used for hand washing.\nCarter\u2019s conservation efforts aren\u2019t the only ones being implemented; units throughout campus are finding creative ways to conserve every possible drop of water. Food Services stopped using water to thaw frozen meats, the Physical Plant has removed the automated flushing mechanisms from 144 toilets in the Student Learning Center\u2014in response to concerns that the toilets were flushing too frequently\u2014and, in the greenhouses, plants are being consolidated and hand-watered to reduce water use.\nAdditionally, many departments, like University Housing, are replacing showerheads and toilets with low-flow devices and have plans to further adjust or change out equipment for water conservation. At Aruna, much of the water conserved has to do with either putting water-consuming machines on standby or simply turning them off, so as not to continually use or leak water. Carter says that if some of the machines in her labs leaked for 24 hours a day, they\u2019d use more than 700 gallons a day. So, some leaky machines are turned off completely and some are put on standby, which means only about six gallons a day are discharged, all of which becomes hand-washing and floor-washing water for the building.\nAt the Animal Care and Use department, large quantities of water are used to wash animal cages for 13 facilities across campus. After adjusting and retrofitting its large cage washers, the unit is saving 1,000 gallons of water per week. It is turning off the elevator-sized machines while not in use and generally thinking about using water more efficiently.\nIn all, eight washers have been reprogrammed to reuse rinse water for the next wash cycle, which saves about 45 gallons of water per cycle per machine. Several washers, which wash everything from primate cages to some of the thousands of research mice cages, have been reprogrammed to use only one rinse cycle\u2014instead of several. Also, the sterilizers are turned off when not in use, which saves 100 gallons an hour, and five sterilizers will be retrofitted with water conservation kits, according to Liz Stich, animal facilities supervisor.\n\u201cIt was kind of a no-brainer,\u201d says Chris King, assistant vice president for research, and director of the Animal Care and Use Program. \u201cWe wash a lot of stuff.\u201d\nResearch facilities, like Animal Care and Use, and Aruna, use approximately one-third of campus water, so these conservation efforts can have a drastic impact on the amount of water the university uses.\nHeightened awareness is what led to both lab\u2019s efforts, but Carter and Stich both say that even if the strict watering mandates lessened or subsided, the water conservation would continue.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our job as a group of people in this small lab to provide the opportunity to save water,\u201d says Carter. \u201cOnce you make people mindful\u2014once it becomes habit\u2014it becomes more natural.\u201d\nResults: A 21% Reduction in Water Use\nIn just the four-month period of November 2007 to February 2008, water usage fell 21%, compared to the same period a year before. This consumption was 11% less than the 10% reduction mandated by Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue in Fall 2007.\nUGA has saved some 84 million gallons of water over five years by replacing sections of 50-year-old condensate return piping for the steam distribution system. Older bathroom plumbing fixtures are being replaced with low-flow fixtures throughout campus, which will save about 30 million gallons of water annually.\nWater also has been saved through use of more efficient irrigation systems, installation of rain gardens, and increased composting. Two existing buildings, and one under construction, will utilize cisterns to capture rainwater and air-conditioning condensation for reuse.\nA significant portion of UGA\u2019s water savings has occurred in research buildings, where usage is down about 26% from last year. Chilled water loops have replaced less-efficient cooling systems in two buildings and water meters have been installed on all cooling towers to monitor usage during the cooling season.\nIn March 2008, use was down by 24% (9.7 million gallons), compared to March 2007, continuing the university\u2019s success at conserving water. About two-thirds of the 40.3-million-gallon reduction is attributable to greater conservation in university research labs and facilities, which the task force report cited as one of the university\u2019s biggest water users.\nMore efficient systems for cooling water have been installed in two large research buildings, and workers in other buildings are helping in smaller ways. A unit that has a lot of fish tanks, for example, is changing water in the tanks less frequently. About 2.8 million gallons has been saved since November by ceasing irrigation of outside plants and turning off fountains.\nKen Crowe, energy services manager in UGA\u2019s physical plant, says no single major factor accounts for the reduced usage. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of small things,\u201d he adds. \u201cPeople are more aware and are paying more attention to how they use water, and we\u2019re seeing the effects of some of the changes we\u2019ve put into place.\u201d\nAuthor's Bio:\nLarry Dendy is assistant to the Vice President for Public Affairs at the University of Georgia.\nAuthor's Bio:\nSara Freeland is a journalist from Athens, GA, and currently writes for the University of Georgia.\nAdvertisement]\n"}, {"score": 1438.9479, "uuid": "075b6dcf-6a23-5bce-9f18-8e39b65bb364", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0611wb-61-17666", "target_hostname": "www.waterefficiency.net", "target_uri": "http://www.waterefficiency.net/WE/Articles/Water_Task_Force_3663.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "<em>Water</em> Task Force | Articles | <em>Water</em> Efficiency", "snippet": "The <em>water</em> <em>is</em> then placed in two-gallon blue Rubbermaid containers with spouts in every bathroom in the building and <em>is</em> used <em>for</em> hand washing.", "explanation": null, "document": "November-December 2008\nWater Task Force\nUniversity of Georgia recently created a program to reduce water use and conserve water over a sustained period of time.\nCopy and Paste This Permanent Link:\nPhoto: @iStockphoto.com/cinoby\nComments\nThe current drought affecting Georgia and much of the Southeast began in 2006 and dramatically worsened in late 2007, resulting in area stream flows and reservoirs dropping precipitously.

Here are some tips on how you can save water in and around your home.\nINDOOR TIPS\nKitchen Tips\nInstall a low-flow faucet aerator, which can cut water use in half.\nSoak pots and pans before washing. When washing dishes by hand, fill one sink or basin with soapy water.\nFill the basin or a pan with water to wash fruits and vegetables.\nKeep a pitcher of water in the refrigerator rather than running tap water until it is cool enough to drink.\nWhen buying a new dishwasher, consider purchasing a water-saving model. Newer models can cut water use by 25 percent and are no more expensive than non-conserving models.\nWash only full loads in the dishwasher.\nBathroom Tips\nBathroom use accounts for about 65 percent of the water used inside the home.\nCheck regularly for any leaks and fix them. Most common bathroom leaks are found in faucets and in and around toilets.\nReplace older, larger-use toilets with the newer ultra-low flush models. Toilets sold during the 80s and early 90s use 13 litres per flush.\nDo NOT use the toilet to dispose of paper, facial tissues, or cigarettes.\nTake a five-minute shower.\nUse the minimum amount of water needed for a bath by closing the drain and the filling the tub only 1/3 full.\nInstall a low-flow showerhead. It can save about half the amount of water you typically use in the shower, while still providing a refreshing, cleansing shower.\nTurn the tap water off while brushing your teeth,\u00a0shaving, or washing your face.\nIf the toilet flush handle frequently sticks in the flush position, letting water run constantly, replace or adjust it.\nLaundry Room Tips\nWhen buying a new clothes washer, consider purchasing a water-saving model. New horizontal axis models can save up to 40 percent of the water used by a conventional model.\u00a0Check with your municipality to see if they provide rebates on the purchase of water-saving clothes washers.\nWash only full loads in the clothes washer.\nInsulate your water pipes. You'll get hot water faster plus avoid wasting water while it heats up.\nOUTDOOR TIPS\nLawns and Grass\nIn the summer, lawn watering and other outdoor uses can account for up to 50 percent of home water use. Studies show that as much as half of this outdoor use is wasteful.\u00a0As a general\u00a0rule, 2 to 3 cm\u00a0 of water per week is adequate.\nDon't overwater your landscape. It can cause yellowing leaves or poor plant health. Give plants only the amount of water that they need.\nUse low-angle or pulsating sprinklers that produce large fat droplets of water. Sprinklers that spray the water high into the air or produce a mist or fine spray lose much of the water through evaporation.\nSet sprinklers to water the lawn, not sidewalks and driveways.\nCheck your sprinkler or irrigation systems regularly for any leaks, and fix them.\nBe sure your hose has an automatic shutoff nozzle to ensure water is not wasted when the hose is left unattended.\nPlanting\nAdd two to four inches of organic material, such as peat or compost, to the soil. Greater soil depth will increase the ability of the soil to retain moisture.\nUse water-wise plants. Native and adaptive plants will use less water and be resistant to local plant diseases and pests.\nCar Washing\nUsing a running hose to wash your car can waste about 400\u00a0litres of water. Using a bucket with a sponge plus a trigger nozzle on the hose will save you about 300\u00a0of those litres.\nPool\nIf you own a pool, be sure to use a pool cover when it's not in use. This will cut down on evaporation losses and will keep it cleaner and warmer. Check equipment such as filtration systems and water inlets on a regular basis for signs of leaks.\nRain Barrel\nCollect rain water in an old barrel or other large container that is outfitted with a spigot and a suitable cover, and use the water on your garden. Use this water as an alternative to turning on the hose for newly transplanted material, window boxes, flower pots and container gardens. Rain water is actually better for your plants as it does not contain any chlorine and is at ambient temperature. Keep your rain barrel covered to prevent mosquito\u2019s breeding and for safety reasons.\nDisclaimer \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0|\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 Privacy Policy \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0|\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 Accessibility \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0|\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 Home\n\u00a9 2010 The Corporation of The City of Welland\n60 East Main Street, Welland, Ontario L3B 3X4 \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0(905) 735-1700\nBusiness Hours - Monday to Friday 8:30am - 4:30pm\n"}, {"score": 1435.2562, "uuid": "f0227ecf-30a6-564a-b10c-386ef27c734a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0105wb-60-16230", "target_hostname": "www.citywestwater.com.au", "target_uri": "http://www.citywestwater.com.au/residents/water_restrictions.aspx", "page_rank": 1.7331273e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Water</em> Restrictions - City West <em>Water</em> Limited", "snippet": "With this change our intent <em>is</em> to provide more flexibility in terms of when you can use <em>water</em> in the garden, not <em>for</em> <em>water</em> use to increase significantly.

This will also retain more of the nutrients.\nKeep a pitcher of water in the refrigerator rather than running tap water until it is cool enough to drink.\nWhen buying a new dishwasher, consider purchasing a water-saving model.\nWash only full loads in the dishwasher.\nBathroom Tips\nCheck regularly for any leaks and fix them. Most common bathroom leaks are found in faucets and in and around toilets. Put food coloring in your toilet tank. If it seeps into the toilet bowl, you have a leak.\nReplace older, larger-use toilets with the newer ultra-low or dual flush models.\nTake a five-minute shower.\nUse the minimum amount of water needed for a bath by closing the drain and the filling the tub only 1/3 full.\nInstall a low-flow showerhead. It can save about half the amount of water you typically use in the shower, while still providing a refreshing, cleansing shower.\nTurn the tap water off while brushing your teeth, shaving, or washing your face.\nTeach your children to turn the faucets off tightly after each use.\nLaundry Room Tips\nWhen buying a new clothes washer, consider purchasing a water-saving model.\nWash only full loads in the clothes washer.\nInsulate your water pipes.

Studies show that as much as half of this outdoor use is wasteful.\nDo not overwater your landscape. It can cause yellowing leaves or poor plant health. Give plants only the amount of water that they need.\nSet sprinklers to water the lawn, not sidewalks and driveways.\nCheck your sprinkler or irrigation systems regularly for any leaks, and fix them.\nBe sure your hose has an automatic shutoff nozzle to ensure water is not wasted when the hose is left unattended.\nUse a broom instead of a hose to clean your driveway or sidewalk and save water every time.\nWe are more likely to notice leaky faucets indoors, but do not forget to check outdoor faucets, pipes, and hoses for leaks.\nUse a rain barrel - Collect rain water in an old barrel or other large container that is outfitted with a tap and a suitable cover, and use the water on your garden. Use this water as an alternative to turning on the hose for newly transplanted material, window boxes, flower pots and container gardens. Rain water is actually better for your plants as it does not contain any chlorine and is at ambient temperature. Keep your rain barrel covered to prevent mosquitoes breeding and for safety reasons.\nPlanting\nAdd two to four inches of organic material, such as peat or compost, to the soil. Greater soil depth will increase the ability of the soil to retain moisture.\nThink about ecoscaping your yard. What is ecoscaping? Ecoscaping combines healthy soil with native and drought-tolerant plants, trees and shrubs to create attractive, low maintenance, and water efficient landscapes which leave a small environmental footprint.\nUse native and adaptive plants; they will use less water and be resistant to local plant diseases and pests.\nCar Washing\nUsing a running hose to wash your car can waste water. Using a bucket with a sponge plus a trigger nozzle on the hose will save water.\nEncourage Change!!\nEncourage your school system and local government to help develop and promote a water conservation ethic among children and adults.\nEncourage your friends and neighbours to be part of a water-conscious community.\nMake suggestions to your employer to save water (and dollars) at work.\nDo one thing each day that will save water.

I have been collecting rainwater from my roof for years in large barrels, so I understand \"water harvesting\", but I'm not sure what is meant by \"passive\" water harvesting.\nAnswer:\nPassive water harvesting, like passive solar energy utilization, tends to be a system of water harvesting requiring little energy input and little effort on the part of the gardener after the system is constructed.\nThis method of water harvesting doesn't involve collection barrels and should have less need for screening and chemicals to prevent mosquitoes and other pests breeding in the harvested water. Water from rooftops and other hardscape areas of the landscape are directed into storage in the soil. This water is applied to trees needing deep irrigation and to areas needing leaching to remove salts that accumulated after application of poor quality water. There is no need for pumping or transporting the water from the storage site to the point of utilization. It is utilized at the storage site.\nWater from the rooftop and other areas is directed by a system of swales (broad shallow ditches) to the area where it will be utilized. The soil is then distributed across that area and seeps into the soil. Water on the surface may evaporate, but the deeper water will be utilized by trees and other deeply rooted plants in the area.\nThe system of swales may be a shallow, almost unnoticeable, linear depression in a lawn area, or it may be a mock arroyo lined with plastic and filled with cobbles and boulders to become a distinctive element in the landscape. The arroyo may be landscaped with appropriate plants within this arroyo or plants may line its margin. The main purpose is to direct the water from near the house to a point of usage away from the foundation and among plants needing deeper irrigation. Passive water harvesting may not provide all the irrigation needed by trees in the landscape, but will reduce the need for purchased or pumped water, reducing costs for maintaining the trees. An interesting fact, long apparent to gardeners, is that rain water is better for plants than tap water. There is no reason to waste rainwater by allowing it to runoff. It is also a waste to allow rainwater to seep deeply into soil with shallow rooted plants. It is best used with the deeper rooted plants in the landscape.\nPassive water harvesting does compete with \"active water harvesting\" in which water is collected in barrels to be distributed by pumping or gravity drainage at a later date. Gardeners should determine which system is most appropriate for their landscape. If the vegetable or flower garden is the place most in need of harvested rain water, then the active water harvesting system will be more appropriate. Other gardeners will find that passive water harvesting is most appropriate for them and provides an opportunity for creating an interesting element in the landscape. Either system allows gardeners to make best use of the (usually) sparse rainfall of the Southwestern U.S.\nback to top\nPlease join us on Southwest Yard & Garden, a weekly program made for gardeners in the Southwest.

The plant can also be operated in direct filtration mode during periods of low raw water turbidity, whereby the clarification process is by-passed.\nThe Plant has been substantially upgraded during 1999 and is now partly automated requiring only one eight hour shift per day to ensure a continuous supply. Most of the plant functions are now automated with most of the human input being to clean and calibrate equipment as well as replenish chemical stocks. Turitea now produces water quality equal to the best conventional plants in the world with final water turbidity typically 0.02 Turbidity Units.\nArtesian wells\nDuring periods of peak demand such as meal times, the mains from Turitea are not sufficient to supply the quantity of water required. To meet this extra demand for water, four pumping stations, drawing water from artesian wells to boost mains pressure, have been constructed in the City - at Papaioea Park, Takaro Park, Keith Street and the Roberts Line area.\nAdditionally, 15 million litres of treated water storage is provided at Ngahere Park. This storage also helps provide the additional water for peak demand as well as emergency situations.\nThe pumps are automatically controlled, starting when local pressures fall below a pre-set level\nThese pumps provide about 40% of the City's supply.\nHosing and water blasting restrictions\nPalmerston North City, Ashhurst and Linton water supplies\nWhen hosing & water blasting restrictions are in force they will be notified on the Public Notice page.

Between July and December of 2010, we found that samples from fewer than 15 properties had elevated lead levels.\u00a0 The limit for lead is 15 parts per billion.\u00a0 Fort Wayne found samples that had a median amount of lead of 23 parts per billion.\nThere are a number of things property owners can do to reduce their possible exposure to lead.\u00a0 Click here for tips for reducing lead in your home.\nBecause of these test results, City Utilities is providing you with the following information from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM). \u00a0Please be assured that if you follow the recommendations outlined below, you can reduce the likelihood that the water you drink will have an elevated level of lead.\u00a0 City Utilities will continue regularly testing water in homes and buildings and will report the results to IDEM and the property owner.\nInformation from IDEM\nFort Wayne City Utilities has found elevated levels of lead in drinking water in some homes and buildings in Fort Wayne.\u00a0 Lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children.\u00a0 Please read this information closely to see what you can do to reduce lead in your drinking water.\nHealth effects of lead\nLead can cause serious health problems if too much enters your body from drinking water or other sources.\u00a0 It can cause damage to the brain and kidneys and can interfere with the production of red blood cells that carry oxygen to all parts of your body.\u00a0 The greatest risk of lead exposure is to infants, young children and pregnant women.\u00a0 Scientists have linked the effects of lead on the brain with lowered IQ in children.\u00a0 Adults with kidney problems and high blood pressure can be affected by low levels of lead more than healthy adults.\u00a0 Lead is stored in the bones, and it can be released later in life.\u00a0 During pregnancy, the child receives lead from the mother\u2019s bones, which may affect the child\u2019s brain development.\nSources of lead\nLead in drinking water, although rarely the sole cause of lead poisoning can significantly increase a person\u2019s total lead exposure, particularly the exposure of infants who drink baby formula and concentrated juices that are mixed with water.\u00a0 The EPA estimates that drinking water can make up to 20 percent or more of a person\u2019s total exposure to lead.\nLead is unusual among drinking water contaminants in that it seldom occurs naturally in water supplies like rivers and lakes.\u00a0 Lead enters drinking water primarily as a result of the corrosion, or wearing away, of materials containing lead in the water distribution system and household plumbing.\u00a0 These materials include lead-based solder used to join copper pipe, brass and chrome plated brass faucets, and in some cases, pipes made of lead that connect houses and buildings to water mains (service lines).\u00a0 In 1986, Congress banned the use of lead solder containing greater than 0.2 percent lead and restricted the lead content of faucets, pipes, and other plumbing materials to 8.0 percent.\u00a0 A new federal law that will go into effect in 2014 will reduce the amount of lead allowed in plumbing fixtures to 0.25 percent.\nWhen water stands in lead pipes or plumbing systems containing lead for several hours or more, the lead may dissolve into your drinking water.\u00a0 This means the first water drawn from the tap in the morning, or later in the afternoon if the water has not been used all day, can contain fairly high levels of lead.\nSteps you can take in the home (or anywhere else) to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water\nLet the water run from the tap before using it for drinking or cooking any time the water in the faucet has gone unused for more than six hours.\u00a0 The longer the water resides in the plumbing, the more lead it may contain.\u00a0\u00a0 Flushing the tap means running the cold water faucet until the water gets noticeably colder, usually about 30 seconds.\u00a0 Although toilet flushing or showering flushes water through a portion of your home\u2019s plumbing system, you still need to flush the water in each faucet before using it for drinking or cooking.\u00a0 Flushing tap water is a simple and inexpensive measure you can take to protect your health.\u00a0 It usually uses less than one or two gallons of water.\u00a0 To conserve water, fill a couple of bottles with water for drinking water after flushing the tap or draw water into a pitcher and place it in the refrigerator.\u00a0 Whenever possible, use the first flush water to wash dishes or water the plants.\nTry not to cook with or drink water from the hot water tap.\u00a0 Hot water can dissolve lead more quickly than cold water.\u00a0 If you need hot water, draw it from the cold tap and then heat it.\u00a0 Boiling water does not remove lead content and can concentrate it.\u00a0 In addition, do not mix baby formula with water from the hot water tap.\nThe steps described above will reduce the lead concentration in your drinking water.\u00a0 However, if you are still concerned, you may wish to purchase bottled water for drinking and cooking.\nFor more information, call the City of Fort Wayne at 311 .\u00a0 For more information on reducing lead exposure around your home or building and the health effects of lead, visit the EPA\u2019s website at http://www.epa.gov/lead or contact your health care provider who can perform a blood test for lead and provide you with information about the health effects of lead.\u00a0 State and local government agencies that may be contacted include:\nFort Wayne\u2019s \u201cOne Call to City Hall\u201d at 311 for more information about water supplied by the City of Fort Wayne.\nIndiana State Department of Health at (317) 233-1250 or the Fort Wayne- Allen County Department of Health at (260) 449-8600 can provide you with information about the health effects of lead.\nCustomers can have their tap water tested by contacting a laboratory certified to test for lead in drinking water.\u00a0 A list of those laboratories is available online at www.in.gov/isdh/22452.htm .\nWhy is this a problem in Fort Wayne and what can be done?\nWater leaving Fort Wayne\u2019s water filtration plant meets or is better than all state and federal regulations require.\u00a0 The water from the plant meets all limits for lead concentration, but water may pick up lead when it sits in your building plumbing.\u00a0 Up until 1986, lead piping and lead solder were standard in the construction business for house and building plumbing such as water pipes and fixtures.\u00a0 These materials deteriorate over time and lead may enter drinking water in homes that have lead pipes or brass faucets or where lead solder has been used.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The water service line that brings water into the building may also be made of lead.\u00a0 If you are interested in finding out if you have a lead water service pipe and how to work with the City to replace it, please contact City Utilities by calling 311.\nLast Updated on 26 January 2012\nMain Menu\n"}, {"score": 1423.0768, "uuid":

They range in size from a compact 40 litres (10 gallons) to a substantial 450 litres (120 gallons).\nTIP When water may be sitting in butts for some time, create shade around the butt (with planting or by using an awning). Also stir up the water periodically to ensure oxygen is present.\nLeaky hose v. sprinklers\nIn a large garden, a travelling sprinkler system is a good idea. This is like a pushchair, with two wheels at the rear and a smaller one at the front. It winds the sprinkler to the end of an extended cable, watering as it goes. It automatically shuts off at the end of its run. get advice from a specialist company which can guide you through the many choices\nTIP When deciding which type of irrigation system is right for you, bear in mind that sprinklers can lose up to 80% of the water to the atmosphere or by evaporation on the ground before getting to the plants. However, they may be the best option where constant cultivation would make using leaky hoses difficult.\nAdapting to climate change\nUnderstanding plants' natural environments allows the gardener to provide the conditions in which the plants will give their best. For those parts of Britain that can suffer from low rainfall and hot summers, strong, drying winds\ncan cause plants to transpire (lose water through their leaves). All of this means that careful selection of plants is crucial to their success.\nTIP In California, the south west Cape District of South Africa, Chile, south and western Australia and the Mediterranean, most of the year's rain falls during the cooler months, and summers are dry. Many plants, native to these areas, can survive on very little moisture and most will grow well in dry areas with hot summers.\nGetting the soil right\nEssential to any new planting is proper soil preparation. With heavy clay this can mean incorporating grit to open the soil, and organic matter to enrich it. This kind of preparation enables the soil to hold on to water without becoming waterlogged, thus allowing rapid establishment of plants. If you are on light or sandy soil, organic matter added in acts in the same way, helping water retention.\nHow much to water\nEstablished plants need approximately 2.5cm of water every 10 days in dry spells. To check the application rates, use rain gauges positioned nearby when watering. Try to water plants either late or early in the day when the moisture will be retained for longer in the soil\nTIP Create a \u2018reservoir' or depression in the ground around the plant, to prevent the water from running away. It is better to give plants a good soaking than to water little and often.\nIt is no good just making the soil damp - it has to be thoroughly wetted for the water to travel down to the roots - the root zone or top 60cm of soil has to be wetted. As a guide, 24 litres per sqm every 7-10 days will be sufficient to maintain plant growth.\nCoarse sand might hold 5cm of rainfall in the top 60cm of soil, while a clay soil might hold 10.5cm of rain. Just remember to garden with nature and not against it.\nChoosing the right plants\nPlants that grow in Mediterranean areas have developed distinctive types of foliage and storage systems, to minimise water loss or store water in periods of drought.\nHairy leaves (such as those on verbascums and phlomis) help reduce the drying effect of the wind and will reflect the sun's rays.\nLeathery or waxy leaves (such as bergenia and sedum) help prevent water loss and evaporation by the wind; they are usually grey in colour, ( like lavender, right) which will reflect the glare of the sun. A waxy or glaucous coating helps seal in moisture.\nGrasses and conifers have thin, needle-like leaves that lose very little water. Their leaves' small surface area prevents excess water loss through evaporation and some will roll their leaves inwards, reducing the surface even more.\nSome plants, like bottlebrushes (callistemon) or fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), reduce their leaf size so much that the stem turns green and takes over as the main photosynthesising organ.\nStorage organs can help a plant survive the driest periods by collecting water at times of plenty. They can be in the form of long tap roots (in plants like sea kale, Crambe maritima), or in bulbs, corms and tubers, such as alliums and eremurus. They will store enough food and water to ensure the plant has the energy to survive until the next rain.\nWater saving notes\nPlants need most water in hot, dry weather - when water companies are least able to supply the demand. At peak times, up to 70% of household water may be used in gardens.\nInstall as many water butts and tanks as possible to capture and store rainwater from times of plenty, for use during dry periods.\n24,000 litres of water (enough to fill 150 water butts) could be collected from the roof of a small house each year.\nWater with soap and detergents is harmless to plants and can supplement rainwater, but not water with bleach.\nTo reduce irrigation, use a thick mulch to limit evaporation from the soil. There are many types available - gravel, compost or bark - all of which aid soil water retention.\nYour Pictures\nPost your garden photos here and see other members'... more \u00bb\nTips For Beginners\nGreat advice and tips to get the most from your garden... more \u00bb\nThe English Garden Shop\n"}, {"score": 1420.9584, "uuid": "9c9a2af7-3977-58fd-b55d-629b80ef0323", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1315wb-71-19188", "target_hostname": "groksurf.com", "target_uri": "http://groksurf.com/tag/north-city-water-reclamation-plant/", "page_rank": 1.1902344e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "North City <em>Water</em> Reclamation <em>Plant</em> \u00ab GrokSurf&#x27;s San Diego", "snippet": "statewide <em>water</em> news, you won&#x27;t find <em>better</em> sources <em>than</em> Aquafornia and Brown &amp; Caldwell <em>Water</em> News.", "explanation": null, "document": "Comments (RSS)\nGrokSurf's San Diego by George J.

Janczyn on June 15, 2010\nIf you live in a northern San Diego neighborhood and took a shower this morning, the water you washed down the drain probably ended up at this location within an hour or two.\n\u201cThis location\u201d is the North City Water Reclamation Plant (NCWRP), a large-scale state-of-the-art facility that can treat up to 30 million gallons of wastewater per day.\nNCWRP is located at the northeast corner of I-805 and Miramar Road but the grounds are camouflaged behind high slopes with landscaping and the only entrance is from Eastgate Mall on the opposite side of the property. Drivers passing on Miramar Road or the freeway are unlikely to even notice it unless they already know about it.\nThe plant treats wastewater to tertiary standards, meaning that the treated water is clean enough for irrigation, landscaping and industrial use.\nA portion of the plant\u2019s grounds will soon see new construction on an even more advanced water treatment facility . The new facility will be used for the City\u2019s Water Purification Demonstration Project , a scientific study to evaluate the feasibility of purifying reclaimed tertiary water to a state that is as clean or cleaner than the raw untreated water the city now imports from the Colorado River and Northern California.\nIf the study proves successful, the City will propose blending the purified reclaimed water with the imported raw water and storing it in the soon-to-be enlarged San Vicente Reservoir . The water would then be aged in the reservoir to allow natural conditioning processes to work. Finally, as is now the case, the reservoir water would be piped to one of the city\u2019s water treatment plants where it would be processed into drinking water ready for distribution to customers. Also, the Helix Water District is working on its own El Monte Valley Project that will use IPR water to recharge groundwater that it uses for its service area in La Mesa, El Cajon, Lemon Grove, Spring Valley, and unincorporated areas near El Cajon. The source of the highly advanced treated water for this project may also be the City of San Diego\u2019s North City Water Reclamation Plant or else the Santee Water Recycling Facility which presently supplies water for the Santee Lakes.\nOne term used for this treatment process is Indirect Potable Reuse , or IPR. It\u2019s sometimes called \u201cplanned indirect potable reuse\u201d because in reality the Colorado River contains treated wastewater from Las Vegas and other communities on the river, so we already do unplanned indirect potable reuse for our drinking water.\nI recently joined a group of UCSD students for a guided tour of the reclamation plant. Brian Drummy, Senior Public Information Officer for the Metropolitan Wastewater Department , provided a very interesting guided tour of the facilities. He kindly supplied the captions for these photos as well. Thanks Brian! And by the way, about that shower water arrival time\u2026that was only my guess as I couldn\u2019t find out how fast wastewater really travels through the system.\n(click any thumbnail for enlargement)\nWastewater is sent through this bar screen system, which gathers and removes large debris.\nPlant\u2019s control room, where all of the plant\u2019s processes are monitored.\nPrimary clarifier, where heavy particles sink to the bottom of the tank and are removed.\nPumps, pipes and tanks within the odor control building.\nTop of the aeration tanks, where wastewater is mixed with bacteria that helps decompose organic pollutants.\nSecondary clarifier, where organic solids sink to the bottom of the tank and are separated from the treated wastewater.\nSecondary clarifier, showing the exit channels for the wastewater.\nExit channels in the secondary clarifier.\nEDR (Electro Dialysis Reversal) area of the plant, where portions of the reclaimed water receive additional treatment for removal of dissolved solids.\nEDR (Electro Dialysis Reversal) area\nEDR (Electro Dialysis Reversal) area\nChlorine contact basin where recycled water is treated with chlorine to kill any remaining bacteria.\n"}, {"score": 1420.0149, "uuid": "50364cad-a11c-5ec6-94f9-f905b346a132", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1717wb-07-22186", "target_hostname": "deepgreenpermaculture.com", "target_uri": "http://deepgreenpermaculture.com/diy-instructions/home-made-plant-rooting-hormone-willow-water/?replytocom=9958", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Home Made <em>Plant</em> Rooting Hormone \u2013 Willow <em>Water</em> \u00ab Deep Green Permaculture", "snippet": "and cover with <em>tap</em> <em>water</em> (unheated), and let it soak <em>for</em> several days.", "explanation": null, "document": "The Sustainable Organic Gardening Guide for Self-Sufficient People\nHome Made Plant Rooting Hormone \u2013 Willow\u00a0Water\nWeeping Willow (Salix babylonica)\nWillows are an amazing tree that have captivated humanity since time immemorial.

They even feature in three of William Shakespeare\u2019s plays, Hamlet, Othello and Twelfth Night.\nSome folklore associated with willows is fascinating \u2013 my two favourites are are that it is bad luck to tell a secret while standing under a willow, as the wind that blows through the leaves will reveal the secret to everyone, and that striking an animal or a child with a willow twig will stunt their growth! They did have some strange ideas way back\u00a0 in Medieval Europe!\nSurely, there is something \u201cmagical\u201d about these trees, for them to capture our attention so strongly.They have some interesting and unique properties, as we\u2019ll explore in this article!\nWillows \u2013 A Brief Introduction\nWillows are fast growing, deciduous trees that are mainly found found in the the Northern Hemisphere, in cold arctic and north temperate zones, in regions with moist soils. The Weeping Willow appears to be a native of extra-tropical Asia, from Japan and China to Armenia and the banks of the Euphrates, and of Egypt and North Africa.\nOne of the most popular and familiar willows is the Weeping willow (Salix babylonica), it has exceptional form and beauty. When mature it exhibits graceful, wide-spreading, pendulous weeping branches, with a short trunk, and a broad rounded crown. Its leaves are thin and narrow, sometimes with whitened or silky undersides. It is fast growing, and adaptable to almost any soil conditions.\nWillows are an incredibly useful tree, they have many useful functions:\nSource of Medicine \u2013 The use of willow bark dates back thousands of years, to the time of Hippocrates (400 BC) when patients were advised to chew on the bark to reduce fever and inflammation. Willow bark has been used throughout the centuries in China and Europe, and continues to be used today for the treatment of pain (particularly low back pain and osteoarthritis), headache, and inflammatory conditions such as bursitis and tendinitis. The bark of white willow contains salicin, which is a chemical similar to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). It is thought to be responsible for the pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects of the herb. In fact, in the 1800s, salicin was used to develop aspirin. White willow appears to be slower than aspirin to bring pain relief, but its effects may last longer. (Ref: University of Maryland\u00a0 Medical Centre, Medical Reference \u2013 Complementary Medicine \u2013 Willow Bark )\nSource of Material for Construction and Manufacturing \u2013 Willow wood is used to make furniture, tool handles, wood veneers, and toys. It is used in wood turning as it is easily worked, and is also used to make cricket bats. Willows are a source of wicker for basketry (weaving of wicker baskets) and for making fish traps. The wood can also be used as a source of fibre for making rope, string and paper. Charcoal used by artists is exclusively made from willow.\nSource of Energy \u2013 Willow is grown for biomass, a renewable energy source which reduces the need for fossil fuels and petroleum products. Willow can be converted into a variety of sustainable environmentally-friendly resources, including: 1. heat and electricity by direct combustion, co-firing with coal, and gasification; 2. biodegradable plastics and other polymers; 3. biofuels.\nWillows are an ideal source of biomass because 1. Willows are easily propagated from unrooted cuttings; 2. High yields can be obtained in a few years, 3. Willow\u2019s genetic diversity and short breeding cycle can be utilized to produce improved varieties; 4. Willows vigorously re-sprout after each harvest; 5. The amount of heat in a dry ton of willow is similar to other hardwoods.\nLarge scale projects to support willow as an energy crop are already at commercial scale in Sweden, and in other countries there are being developed through initiatives such as the Willow Biomass Project in the US and the Energy Coppice Project in the UK. (Ref: College of Environmental Science and Forestry \u2013 The Willow Biomass Project )\nEcological/Environmental Uses \u2013 Willows have many beneficial environmental uses. They can be used in the following areas:\nRiparian buffers \u2013 Natural barriers that prevent chemicals from entering streams, ponds, and lakes.\nPhytoremediation \u2013 Willows clean up toxins from contaminated sites.\nWastewater management (biofiltration) \u2013 Willows filter contaminants from wastewater, and can be used in ecological wastewater treatment systems.\nEnvironmental protection and preservation \u2013 Willows are often used for land reclamation, streambank stabilisation (bioengineering), slope stabilisation, soil erosion control, shelterbelt and\u00a0 windbreak construction, soil building, and soil reclamation.\nEnvironmental reconstruction \u2013 Willows are used for constructing wetlands and wildlife habitat.\nGardening \u2013 Willows are used for in the construction of hedges, \u201cliving fences\u201d and other living garden structures and general landscaping\nLiving snowfences \u2013 Strategically planted willows trap drifting snow.\nFarming \u2013 Willows can used by farmers as an animal forage to feed their stock.\nHorticultural Uses \u2013 Willow bark contains natural plant growth hormones which can be used for rooting new cuttings. This is the area that we\u2019ll be looking at in this article!\nOne of the most amazing properties of willows is their growth! Coppicing a willow (that is cutting it back to ground level) will result in numerous rods growing from the base that will grow at an amazing rate of 1.2-3.0m in a single season. A broken willow branch left in water will grow roots. Willows successfully root from very thick pieces of stem, this method is known as taking \u201ctrunk cuttings\u201d, and a stem as thick as a human thigh will take root of put into damp ground. Willow cuttings can even grow if put in upside-down (but please do the right thing and put them in the right way up)! This property of willows is due to the naturally occurring plant rooting hormones that they contain. We can take advantage of this naturally occurring hormone, and make extracts that we can use to induce rooting on cuttings of other plants.\n\u201cWillow Water\u201d \u2013 How it Works\n\u201cWillow Water\u201d is a homebrew plant rooting hormone that is easily made and can be used to increase the strike rate (growth of roots) of cuttings that you\u2019re trying to propagate.\nThe way that it works can be attributed to two substances that can be found within the Salix (Willow) species, namely, indolebutyric acid (IBA) and Salicylic acid (SA).\nIndolebutyric acid (IBA) is a plant hormone that stimulates root growth. It is present in high concentrations in the growing tips of willow branches. By using the actively growing parts of a willow branch, cutting them, and soaking them in water, you can get significant quantities of IBA to leach out into the water.\nSalicylic acid (SA) (which is a chemical similar to the headache medicine Aspirin) is a plant hormone which is involved in signalling a plant\u2019s defences, it is involved in the process of \u201csystemic acquired resistance\u201d (SAR) \u2013 where an attack on one part of the plant induces a resistance response to pathogens (triggers the plant\u2019s internal defences) in other parts of the plant. It can also trigger a defence response in nearby plants by converting the salicylic acid into a volatile chemical form.\nWhen you make willow water, both salicylic acid and IBA leach into the water, and both have a beneficial effect when used for the propagation of cuttings. One of the biggest threats to newly propagated cuttings is infection by bacteria and fungi. Salicylic acid helps plants to fight off infection, and can thus give cuttings a better chance of survival. Plants, when attacked by infectious agents, often do not produce salicylic acid quickly enough to defend themselves, so providing the acid in water can be particularly beneficial.\nWillow water can be made from cuttings of any tree or shrub of the willow family, a group of plants with the scientific name of Salix. The more cuttings that are used and the longer they are soaked in water, the stronger will be the resulting willow water. Recommendations for the exact method of soaking vary. Cold water can be used, and soaking times of four or more weeks are often quoted. Other gardeners use boiling water to steep the willow twigs and soak the mixture for around 24 hours.\nHow to Make \u201cWillow Water\u201d\nHere is the procedure for making willow water:\nCollect young first-year twigs and stems of any of willow (Salix spp.) species, these have green or yellow bark. Don\u2019t use the older growth that has brown or gray bark.\nRemove all the leaves, these are not used. Don\u2019t waste good green material though, compost the leaves or throw them in the garden as mulch.\nTake the twigs and cut them up into short pieces around 1\" (2.5cm) long.\nThe next step is to add the water. there are several techniques to extract the natural plant rooting hormones:\na) Place the chopped willow twigs in a container and cover with boiling water, just like making tea, and allow the \u201ctea\u201d to stand overnight.\nb) Place the chopped willow twigs in a container and cover with tap water (unheated), and let it soak for several days.\nWhen finished, separate the liquid from the twigs by carefully pouring out the liquid, or pouring it through a strainer or sieve. The liquid is now ready to use for rooting cuttings. You can keep the liquid for up to two months if you put it in a jar with a tight fitting lid and keep the liquid in the refrigerator. Remember to label the jar so you remember what it is, and write down the date you brewed it up, and to aid the memory, write down the date that it should be used by, which is two months from the date it was made!\nTo use, just pour some willow water into a small jar, and place the cuttings in there like flowers in a vase, and leave them there to soak overnight for several hours so that they take up the plant rooting hormone. Then prepare them as you would when propagating any other cuttings.\nThe second way to use willow water is to use it to water the propagating medium in which you have placed cuttings. Watering your cuttings twice with willow water should be enough to help them root.\nIn Summary\nAs you can see, this is a garden potion that is really easy to brew up, and it keeps in line with the Permaculture principles of avoiding waste and caring for the Earth \u2013 no purchased synthetic chemicals, containers, it\u2019s all natural, and best of all, free! So, next time you\u2019re out on a hot summer\u2019s day enjoying the shade and natural cooling provided by a majestic willow, grab a few twigs and take them home to help you in propagating plants for your garden!\nLike this:\nBe the first to like this page.\n32 Responses to \u201cHome Made Plant Rooting Hormone \u2013 Willow\u00a0Water\u201d\ndavid hicks\n"}, {"score": 1419.7382, "uuid": "24ed2ddf-cfdc-5404-b7ae-9ca49f4ad5dd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1717wb-07-22185", "target_hostname": "deepgreenpermaculture.com", "target_uri": "http://deepgreenpermaculture.com/diy-instructions/home-made-plant-rooting-hormone-willow-water/?replytocom=9941", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Home Made <em>Plant</em> Rooting Hormone \u2013 Willow <em>Water</em> \u00ab Deep Green Permaculture", "snippet": "and cover with <em>tap</em> <em>water</em> (unheated), and let it soak <em>for</em> several days.", "explanation": null, "document": "The Sustainable Organic Gardening Guide for Self-Sufficient People\nHome Made Plant Rooting Hormone \u2013 Willow\u00a0Water\nWeeping Willow (Salix babylonica)\nWillows are an amazing tree that have captivated humanity since time immemorial.

Don\u2019t waste good green material though, compost the leaves or throw them in the garden as mulch.\nTake the twigs and cut them up into short pieces around 1\" (2.5cm) long.\nThe next step is to add the water. there are several techniques to extract the natural plant rooting hormones:\na) Place the chopped willow twigs in a container and cover with boiling water, just like making tea, and allow the \u201ctea\u201d to stand overnight.\nb) Place the chopped willow twigs in a container and cover with tap water (unheated), and let it soak for several days.\nWhen finished, separate the liquid from the twigs by carefully pouring out the liquid, or pouring it through a strainer or sieve. The liquid is now ready to use for rooting cuttings. You can keep the liquid for up to two months if you put it in a jar with a tight fitting lid and keep the liquid in the refrigerator. Remember to label the jar so you remember what it is, and write down the date you brewed it up, and to aid the memory, write down the date that it should be used by, which is two months from the date it was made!\nTo use, just pour some willow water into a small jar, and place the cuttings in there like flowers in a vase, and leave them there to soak overnight for several hours so that they take up the plant rooting hormone. Then prepare them as you would when propagating any other cuttings.\nThe second way to use willow water is to use it to water the propagating medium in which you have placed cuttings. Watering your cuttings twice with willow water should be enough to help them root.\nIn Summary\nAs you can see, this is a garden potion that is really easy to brew up, and it keeps in line with the Permaculture principles of avoiding waste and caring for the Earth \u2013 no purchased synthetic chemicals, containers, it\u2019s all natural, and best of all, free!

The Weeping Willow appears to be a native of extra-tropical Asia, from Japan and China to Armenia and the banks of the Euphrates, and of Egypt and North Africa.\nOne of the most popular and familiar willows is the Weeping willow (Salix babylonica), it has exceptional form and beauty. When mature it exhibits graceful, wide-spreading, pendulous weeping branches, with a short trunk, and a broad rounded crown. Its leaves are thin and narrow, sometimes with whitened or silky undersides. It is fast growing, and adaptable to almost any soil conditions.\nWillows are an incredibly useful tree, they have many useful functions:\nSource of Medicine \u2013 The use of willow bark dates back thousands of years, to the time of Hippocrates (400 BC) when patients were advised to chew on the bark to reduce fever and inflammation. Willow bark has been used throughout the centuries in China and Europe, and continues to be used today for the treatment of pain (particularly low back pain and osteoarthritis), headache, and inflammatory conditions such as bursitis and tendinitis. The bark of white willow contains salicin, which is a chemical similar to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). It is thought to be responsible for the pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects of the herb. In fact, in the 1800s, salicin was used to develop aspirin. White willow appears to be slower than aspirin to bring pain relief, but its effects may last longer. (Ref: University of Maryland\u00a0 Medical Centre, Medical Reference \u2013 Complementary Medicine \u2013 Willow Bark )\nSource of Material for Construction and Manufacturing \u2013 Willow wood is used to make furniture, tool handles, wood veneers, and toys. It is used in wood turning as it is easily worked, and is also used to make cricket bats. Willows are a source of wicker for basketry (weaving of wicker baskets) and for making fish traps. The wood can also be used as a source of fibre for making rope, string and paper. Charcoal used by artists is exclusively made from willow.\nSource of Energy \u2013 Willow is grown for biomass, a renewable energy source which reduces the need for fossil fuels and petroleum products. Willow can be converted into a variety of sustainable environmentally-friendly resources, including: 1. heat and electricity by direct combustion, co-firing with coal, and gasification; 2. biodegradable plastics and other polymers; 3. biofuels.\nWillows are an ideal source of biomass because 1. Willows are easily propagated from unrooted cuttings; 2. High yields can be obtained in a few years, 3. Willow\u2019s genetic diversity and short breeding cycle can be utilized to produce improved varieties; 4. Willows vigorously re-sprout after each harvest; 5. The amount of heat in a dry ton of willow is similar to other hardwoods.\nLarge scale projects to support willow as an energy crop are already at commercial scale in Sweden, and in other countries there are being developed through initiatives such as the Willow Biomass Project in the US and the Energy Coppice Project in the UK. (Ref: College of Environmental Science and Forestry \u2013 The Willow Biomass Project )\nEcological/Environmental Uses \u2013 Willows have many beneficial environmental uses. They can be used in the following areas:\nRiparian buffers \u2013 Natural barriers that prevent chemicals from entering streams, ponds, and lakes.\nPhytoremediation \u2013 Willows clean up toxins from contaminated sites.\nWastewater management (biofiltration) \u2013 Willows filter contaminants from wastewater, and can be used in ecological wastewater treatment systems.\nEnvironmental protection and preservation \u2013 Willows are often used for land reclamation, streambank stabilisation (bioengineering), slope stabilisation, soil erosion control, shelterbelt and\u00a0 windbreak construction, soil building, and soil reclamation.\nEnvironmental reconstruction \u2013 Willows are used for constructing wetlands and wildlife habitat.\nGardening \u2013 Willows are used for in the construction of hedges, \u201cliving fences\u201d and other living garden structures and general landscaping\nLiving snowfences \u2013 Strategically planted willows trap drifting snow.\nFarming \u2013 Willows can used by farmers as an animal forage to feed their stock.\nHorticultural Uses \u2013 Willow bark contains natural plant growth hormones which can be used for rooting new cuttings. This is the area that we\u2019ll be looking at in this article!\nOne of the most amazing properties of willows is their growth! Coppicing a willow (that is cutting it back to ground level) will result in numerous rods growing from the base that will grow at an amazing rate of 1.2-3.0m in a single season. A broken willow branch left in water will grow roots. Willows successfully root from very thick pieces of stem, this method is known as taking \u201ctrunk cuttings\u201d, and a stem as thick as a human thigh will take root of put into damp ground. Willow cuttings can even grow if put in upside-down (but please do the right thing and put them in the right way up)! This property of willows is due to the naturally occurring plant rooting hormones that they contain. We can take advantage of this naturally occurring hormone, and make extracts that we can use to induce rooting on cuttings of other plants.\n\u201cWillow Water\u201d \u2013 How it Works\n\u201cWillow Water\u201d is a homebrew plant rooting hormone that is easily made and can be used to increase the strike rate (growth of roots) of cuttings that you\u2019re trying to propagate.\nThe way that it works can be attributed to two substances that can be found within the Salix (Willow) species, namely, indolebutyric acid (IBA) and Salicylic acid (SA).\nIndolebutyric acid (IBA) is a plant hormone that stimulates root growth. It is present in high concentrations in the growing tips of willow branches. By using the actively growing parts of a willow branch, cutting them, and soaking them in water, you can get significant quantities of IBA to leach out into the water.\nSalicylic acid (SA) (which is a chemical similar to the headache medicine Aspirin) is a plant hormone which is involved in signalling a plant\u2019s defences, it is involved in the process of \u201csystemic acquired resistance\u201d (SAR) \u2013 where an attack on one part of the plant induces a resistance response to pathogens (triggers the plant\u2019s internal defences) in other parts of the plant. It can also trigger a defence response in nearby plants by converting the salicylic acid into a volatile chemical form.\nWhen you make willow water, both salicylic acid and IBA leach into the water, and both have a beneficial effect when used for the propagation of cuttings. One of the biggest threats to newly propagated cuttings is infection by bacteria and fungi. Salicylic acid helps plants to fight off infection, and can thus give cuttings a better chance of survival. Plants, when attacked by infectious agents, often do not produce salicylic acid quickly enough to defend themselves, so providing the acid in water can be particularly beneficial.\nWillow water can be made from cuttings of any tree or shrub of the willow family, a group of plants with the scientific name of Salix. The more cuttings that are used and the longer they are soaked in water, the stronger will be the resulting willow water. Recommendations for the exact method of soaking vary. Cold water can be used, and soaking times of four or more weeks are often quoted. Other gardeners use boiling water to steep the willow twigs and soak the mixture for around 24 hours.\nHow to Make \u201cWillow Water\u201d\nHere is the procedure for making willow water:\nCollect young first-year twigs and stems of any of willow (Salix spp.) species, these have green or yellow bark.

This is the area that we\u2019ll be looking at in this article!\nOne of the most amazing properties of willows is their growth! Coppicing a willow (that is cutting it back to ground level) will result in numerous rods growing from the base that will grow at an amazing rate of 1.2-3.0m in a single season. A broken willow branch left in water will grow roots. Willows successfully root from very thick pieces of stem, this method is known as taking \u201ctrunk cuttings\u201d, and a stem as thick as a human thigh will take root of put into damp ground. Willow cuttings can even grow if put in upside-down (but please do the right thing and put them in the right way up)! This property of willows is due to the naturally occurring plant rooting hormones that they contain. We can take advantage of this naturally occurring hormone, and make extracts that we can use to induce rooting on cuttings of other plants.\n\u201cWillow Water\u201d \u2013 How it Works\n\u201cWillow Water\u201d is a homebrew plant rooting hormone that is easily made and can be used to increase the strike rate (growth of roots) of cuttings that you\u2019re trying to propagate.\nThe way that it works can be attributed to two substances that can be found within the Salix (Willow) species, namely, indolebutyric acid (IBA) and Salicylic acid (SA).\nIndolebutyric acid (IBA) is a plant hormone that stimulates root growth. It is present in high concentrations in the growing tips of willow branches. By using the actively growing parts of a willow branch, cutting them, and soaking them in water, you can get significant quantities of IBA to leach out into the water.\nSalicylic acid (SA) (which is a chemical similar to the headache medicine Aspirin) is a plant hormone which is involved in signalling a plant\u2019s defences, it is involved in the process of \u201csystemic acquired resistance\u201d (SAR) \u2013 where an attack on one part of the plant induces a resistance response to pathogens (triggers the plant\u2019s internal defences) in other parts of the plant. It can also trigger a defence response in nearby plants by converting the salicylic acid into a volatile chemical form.\nWhen you make willow water, both salicylic acid and IBA leach into the water, and both have a beneficial effect when used for the propagation of cuttings. One of the biggest threats to newly propagated cuttings is infection by bacteria and fungi. Salicylic acid helps plants to fight off infection, and can thus give cuttings a better chance of survival. Plants, when attacked by infectious agents, often do not produce salicylic acid quickly enough to defend themselves, so providing the acid in water can be particularly beneficial.\nWillow water can be made from cuttings of any tree or shrub of the willow family, a group of plants with the scientific name of Salix. The more cuttings that are used and the longer they are soaked in water, the stronger will be the resulting willow water. Recommendations for the exact method of soaking vary. Cold water can be used, and soaking times of four or more weeks are often quoted. Other gardeners use boiling water to steep the willow twigs and soak the mixture for around 24 hours.\nHow to Make \u201cWillow Water\u201d\nHere is the procedure for making willow water:\nCollect young first-year twigs and stems of any of willow (Salix spp.) species, these have green or yellow bark. Don\u2019t use the older growth that has brown or gray bark.\nRemove all the leaves, these are not used. Don\u2019t waste good green material though, compost the leaves or throw them in the garden as mulch.\nTake the twigs and cut them up into short pieces around 1\" (2.5cm) long.\nThe next step is to add the water. there are several techniques to extract the natural plant rooting hormones:\na) Place the chopped willow twigs in a container and cover with boiling water, just like making tea, and allow the \u201ctea\u201d to stand overnight.\nb) Place the chopped willow twigs in a container and cover with tap water (unheated), and let it soak for several days.\nWhen finished, separate the liquid from the twigs by carefully pouring out the liquid, or pouring it through a strainer or sieve. The liquid is now ready to use for rooting cuttings. You can keep the liquid for up to two months if you put it in a jar with a tight fitting lid and keep the liquid in the refrigerator. Remember to label the jar so you remember what it is, and write down the date you brewed it up, and to aid the memory, write down the date that it should be used by, which is two months from the date it was made!\nTo use, just pour some willow water into a small jar, and place the cuttings in there like flowers in a vase, and leave them there to soak overnight for several hours so that they take up the plant rooting hormone. Then prepare them as you would when propagating any other cuttings.\nThe second way to use willow water is to use it to water the propagating medium in which you have placed cuttings. Watering your cuttings twice with willow water should be enough to help them root.\nIn Summary\nAs you can see, this is a garden potion that is really easy to brew up, and it keeps in line with the Permaculture principles of avoiding waste and caring for the Earth \u2013 no purchased synthetic chemicals, containers, it\u2019s all natural, and best of all, free! So, next time you\u2019re out on a hot summer\u2019s day enjoying the shade and natural cooling provided by a majestic willow, grab a few twigs and take them home to help you in propagating plants for your garden!\nLike this:\nBe the first to like this page.\n32 Responses to \u201cHome Made Plant Rooting Hormone \u2013 Willow\u00a0Water\u201d\ndavid hicks\n"}, {"score": 1417.6556, "uuid": "1b2b8f96-e789-5468-8a5b-c49436272866", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1609wb-03-29984", "target_hostname": "www.alantitchmarsh.com", "target_uri": "http://www.alantitchmarsh.com/index.htm?ac=d98xc-i", "page_rank": 1.1721075e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "<em>Water</em> Wisely", "snippet": "You can collect enough from the house, greenhouse, conservatory and shed to keep all the must-have parts of the garden growing happily, and rainwater <em>is</em> so much <em>better</em> <em>for</em> them <em>than</em> chemically-treated <em>tap</em> <em>water</em>.

They\u0092re filled with invaluable tips and advice for the gardener of all levels. Have a browse though the articles, there\u0092s something for everyone here.\nUSING WATER WISELY\nAfter several wringing-wet winters and summer weather that\u0092s been \u0091traditional\u0092 (ie rainy) rather than the long, hot, dry Mediterranean conditions we\u0092d been warned to expect from global warming, you probably feel there\u0092s no need to be careful with water.\nWell, it\u0092s true that you don\u0092t need to reach for the hose-pipe half so often in a poor summer since the weather does most of your watering for you, but there are always those few things that need a helping hand with the H2O, and so far in my own Hampshire garden this spring and summer it\u0092s been pretty dry.\nYou can\u0092t leave tubs and hanging baskets to fend for themselves even if we have summer showers since they\u0092re often in the \u0091rain shadow\u0092 of the house, and by the time container-plants have grown up enough they act as their own umbrella, shrugging off any rain that does reach them.\nIntensively-planted veg and salad beds also need checking regularly; if they dry out badly \u0096 just once is enough - results suffer; closely-spaced crops may need watering every day during the summer, even if it isn\u0092t a real scorcher. The same is true of any plants growing in the greenhouse, but particularly those in pots, which dry out in a trice.\nAny newly planted flowers, roses and shrubs anywhere in the garden will also benefit from regular watering to help them get established, at least for their first few months, but don\u0092t do it little-and-often \u0096 what works best is a thorough soak about once a week when the soil round them gets dry.\nAnd in a long dry spell it\u0092s also advisable to water any fruit trees and bushes that are carrying crops, since unripe fruit is often shed prematurely if the plants are under stress due to water shortage.\nBut there are lots of places you really don\u0092t need to bother watering, even if natural rainfall is a little lacking.\nEstablished trees shrubs and climbers can safely be left to look after themselves, and the lawn will be fine even if it turns a bit brown - if you don\u0092t cut it too closely it\u0092ll stay greener for far longer, even in a drought.\nAllotment crops often fare surprisingly well even when there\u0092s no water supply on the site, as long as you incorporated plenty of moisture-holding organic matter during the winter digging and spaced everything out very generously at planting time so their roots have access to a large \u0091catchment area\u0092.\nBut as summer marches on it\u0092s very important to keep weeds well hoed off, or they\u0092ll compete with crops for any available moisture - and the weeds always win.\nAnd even in a wet summer it\u0092s worth saving water off any handy roof. You can collect enough from the house, greenhouse, conservatory and shed to keep all the must-have parts of the garden growing happily, and rainwater is so much better for them than chemically-treated tap water.\nWhat\u0092s more when you have a water meter you can make worthwhile savings on your bill. And since it sounds as if many more of us will be lumbered with water meters in the future, you might just as well get set up now.\nThere are myriads of water diverting devices that send bath water or rainfall from roofs into storage tanks or waterbutts, and you don\u0092t have to spend a fortune if you shop around at the big DIY \u0091sheds\u0092 \u0096 local councils sometimes have special offers - details are sent out with your council tax demands.\nSo do your bit to keep gardening in the face of uncertain future water supplies; get plumbing.\nRecommended\u00a0products \u00a0:\n"}, {"score": 1416.8796, "uuid": "b3179923-969b-59dd-9187-36ff8cac8505", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0603wb-98-29447", "target_hostname": "www.twdb.state.tx.us", "target_uri": "http://www.twdb.state.tx.us/DATA/DROUGHT/save_water2.asp", "page_rank": 1.1969077e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "<em>Water</em> Saving Tips", "snippet": "Keep a container of drinking <em>water</em> in the refrigerator.

(This is also better for clothing made of today\u0092s synthetic fabrics.)\nFor Appliances and Plumbing...\nCheck water requirements of various models and brands when considering purchasing any new appliances. Some use less water than others.\nCheck all water-line connections and faucets for leaks. A slow drip can waste as much as 170 gallons of water EACH DAY, or 5,000 gallons per month, and will add to the water bill.\nLearn to repair faucets so that drips can be corrected promptly. It is easy to do, costs very little, and can mean a substantial savings in plumbing and water bills.\nCheck for hidden water leakage such as a leak between the water meter and the house. To check, turn off all indoor and outdoor faucets and water-using appliances. The water meter should be read at 10 to 20 minute intervals. If it continues to run or turn, a leak probably exists and needs to be located.\nInsulate all hot water pipes to reduce the delays (and wasted water) experienced while waiting for the water to \"run hot.\"\nBe sure the water heater thermostat is not set too high. Extremely hot settings waste water and energy because the water often has to be cooled with cold water before it can be used.\nUse a moisture meter to determine when house plants need water. More plants die from over-watering than from being on the dry side.\nFor Outdoor Use\nWater only when needed. Look at the grass, feel the soil, or use a soil moisture meter to determine when to water.\nDo not over-water. Soil can hold only so much moisture, and the rest simply runs off. A timer will help, and either a kitchen timer or an alarm clock will do. Apply only enough water to fill the plant\u0092s root zone. Excess water beyond that is wasted. One and a half inches of water applied once a week in the summer will keep most Texas grasses alive and healthy.\nWater lawns early in the morning during the hotter summer months. Otherwise, much of the water used on the lawn can simply evaporate between the sprinkler and the grass.\nTo avoid excessive evaporation, use a sprinkler that produces large drops of water, rather than a fine mist. Sprinklers that send droplets out on a low angle also help control evaporation. Adjust sprinkler heads as necessary, to avoid waste, runoff and ensure proper coverage.\nSet automatic sprinkler systems to provide thorough, but infrequent watering. Pressure-regulating devices should be set to design specifications. Rain shutoff devices can prevent watering in the rain.\nUse drip irrigation systems for bedded plants, trees, or shrubs, or turn soaker hoses upside-down so the holes are on the bottom. This will help avoid evaporation.\nWater slowly for better absorption, and never water on windy days.\nForget about watering the streets or walks or driveways. They will never grow a thing.\nCondition the soil with mulch or compost before planting grass or flowerbeds so that water will soak in rather than run off.\nFertilize lawns at least twice a year for root stimulation, but do not over-fertilize. Grass with a good root system makes better use of less water and is more drought-tolerant.\nDo not scalp lawns when mowing during hot weather. Taller grass holds moisture better. Grass should be cut fairly often, so that only 1/2 to 3/4 inch is trimmed off. A better looking lawn will result.\nUse a watering can or hand water with the hose in small areas of the lawn that need more frequent watering (those near walks or driveways or in especially hot, sunny spots).\nUse water-wise plants. Learn what types of grass, shrubbery, and plants do best in the area and in which parts of the lawn, and then plant accordingly. Choose plants that have low water requirements, are drought-tolerant, and are adapted to the area of the state where they are to be planted.\nConsider decorating some areas of the lawn with wood chips, rocks, gravel, or other materials now available that require no water at all.\nDo not \"sweep\" walks and driveways with the hose. Use a broom or rake instead.\nWhen washing the car, use a bucket of soapy water and turn on the hose only for rinsing.\nLearn and use waterwise concepts in your landscape.\nFor additional information or comments concerning Water Conservation contact:\nJohn Sutton\njohn.sutton@twdb.texas.gov\n512/463-7988\n"}], [{"score": 1414.1873, "uuid": "4caeb6e9-aa3b-56bf-8533-18bf3e151342", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0903wb-18-11840", "target_hostname": "blog.epa.gov", "target_uri": "http://blog.epa.gov/blog/category/water/", "page_rank": 1.8228559e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Greenversations \u00bb <em>Water</em>", "snippet": "On average, the cost to treat, filter and deliver <em>tap</em> <em>water</em> <em>is</em> 0.2 cents per gallon \u2013 roughly 750-2,700 times less expensive <em>than</em> bottled <em>water</em>.

In a quaint coffee shop in St. Helena, California, I finally had a chance to sit down with Chuck and meet him in person.\nWhile he is the likely front-runner with the most photographs in the final Documerica collection, his images are not yet in Flickr. Only about 4,000 have been scanned into the National Archives Flickr account, but over 15,000 images actually exist and are available in NARA\u2019s online Archival Research Catalog . It requires patience, but searching by Documerica photographer, state, or environmental topic is worth the digging.\nI asked him how he took this photo, a favorite that I found:\nCrop dusting near Calipatria in the Imperial Valley, 5/1972 by Charles O'Rear.\nHow quickly did he have to duck and cover? No tripod, he confirmed. His memory of that exact photo was a little foggy, fair enough, but he said he was highly doubtful that the pilot pulled up in time. With a chuckle he said he was glad he\u2019s still around, but that dosage of pesticides was just one of those moments that comes with the territory of being a photojournalist. Taking risks is living, he says.\nHis Documerica assignments took him throughout California, down along the Colorado River on the Mexican side of the border, Hawaii and more. He kept coming up with ideas and Gifford Hampshire kept sending him out.\nI could have sat with him for hours and just about did. It was easy to zing from topic to topic, place to place around the world. Since Documerica, he photographed for National Geographic magazine for 25 years. It was going to be a challenge to name a place he hadn\u2019t traveled to. So I tried.\n\u201cBeen to Palau?\u201d\nColorado River on the Mexican side of the border, 5/1972 by Charles O'Rear\nShockingly, my first attempt got him, but he has been to Yap!

During a story about currencies around the world, he photographed the Yapese Rai: large stone disks that were brought back by rafts and determination from Papua New Guinea and Palau. Today, islanders and visitors use the American dollar, but Rai are still ceremoniously exchanged.\nHis adventures continue; he just returned from Australia and can\u2019t wait to get back.

We have the following list of suggestions to help your business to save water.\n1. Monitor your water use:\nCheck your bills for unusually high use.\nIf you can access your water meter, check it regularly to help discover leaks.\nRegularly check remotely located buildings and pipework so that leaks don\u2019t go unnoticed.\nAnglian Water Business can install smart meters , providing continuous graphical consumption information to help you to better understand your water use.\n2. Benchmark:\nCompare your water use with other businesses in the same industry.\nIf you have multiple sites then compare their water usage to identify best practice for water minimisation.\n3. Check for leaks:\nCheck for underground pipe leaks and leaks from internal plumbing, outdoor taps, sprinklers and hoses. For advice on\u00a0how to detect a leak, see our 'How to' guide .\nConsider installing automatic leak detectors to turn off the water supply when the device notices unusual water consumption.\n4. Reduce water use for toilet flushing:\nOlder cisterns may use up to 13 litres of water for every flush, compared to flush volumes of 6 litres or less for new models. Reduce the amount of water used for each toilet flush by inserting displacement devices in the cistern. For advice on to how to fit a displacement device see our 'How to' guide . Alternatively, old style single-flush toilets can be replaced with more water-efficient models .\nWhere dual-flush cisterns are installed, place a clearly visible notice to explain how to operate both flushes to prevent incorrect operation and wastage.\nNew toilets may have overflows or leaks that discharge directly into the pan which may not be noticed or reported. Identify toilets with internal overflows and regularly check for discharge.\n5. Reduce water use for urinal flushing: Urinals can use considerably less water than flushing toilets, so install adequate numbers in all male toilet areas. Ensure urinals are running economically. For advice on how to carry out urinal flow reduction, see our 'How to' guide .\n6. Reduce water use from taps:\nFix any leaking taps \u2013 a dripping tap can waste 5,000 litres a year, while a replacement tap washer only costs a few pence.\nFit water-saving aerators on taps\u00a0or self-closing push taps and hoses.\nReduce the flow of water from taps; in-line servicing valves with flow restriction reduce wastage and make maintenance easier.\n7. Reduce the flow of water from any on-site showers: If a shower fills an 8-litre bucket in less than 40 seconds, you could benefit from replacing the showerhead with a water-efficient model .\n8. Make washing more efficient:\nRun your clothes washer and dishwasher only when they are full.\nIf you have to do a wash, match the programme to the size of the load.\nIf your dishwasher is new, cut back on rinsing \u2013 newer models clean more thoroughly than older ones.\nIf your dishwasher is old, check it doesn\u2019t leak.\n9. Make processes more efficient: Optimise your cooling systems and water softeners to save both water and chemicals.\n10. Consider reusing process water: If you use large amounts of water in a commercial process, our technical advice service may help you to become more efficient and can advise on water reuse.\n11. Know where your stop tap is located: Put a sign up so others can identify it. This could save water and prevent damage to your premises in the event of a burst pipe.\n12. Reduce watering of gardens and grounds:\nChoose plants that don\u2019t need much watering.\nUse water saving products such as water retention granules.\nLearn how to shut off your automatic watering system in case it malfunctions or you get an unexpected rain.\n13. Buy water-efficient equipment:\nSpecify low water consumption requirements for any new appliances, fittings or processes.\nHigh pressure spray jetters can use less water than conventional hoses as they use pressure instead of a large volume of water to clean.\nSome vacuum pumps require water for lubrication and flushing, consider installing alternative pumps.\n14. Insulate pipes:\nProtect against cold weather-related bursts by insulating pipes.\nInsulate hot water pipes for more immediate hot water at the tap and for water and energy savings.\n15. Create plans to reduce water use and review once a year:\nEducate all staff on water efficiency initiatives and get support from management.\nLook at how to incorporate initiatives into your wider environmental policy.\n"}, {"score": 1412.997, "uuid": "8219ab0a-b85f-5f52-a4f3-dfcd3242ae74", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0715wb-06-16884", "target_hostname": "www.yorkshirewater.com", "target_uri": "http://www.yorkshirewater.com/education-and-learning/school-zone/the-water-cycle.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1951503e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "The <em>water</em> cycle", "snippet": "and meets expectations * 4 = Service <em>is</em> good and <em>better</em> <em>than</em> expectations * 5 = Service <em>is</em> excellent and exceeds expectations * 3 = Service <em>is</em> satisfactory and meets expectations * 4 = Service <em>is</em> good and <em>better</em> <em>than</em> expectations * 5 = Service <em>is</em> excellent and exceeds expectations * 3 = Service <em>is</em> satisfactory", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nThe water cycle\nWater is one of nature's greatest gifts.\u00a0 It falls from the sky as rain before finding its way into rivers or sinking into the ground.\u00a0 Eventually it returns to the sea where it evaporates, forming rain-clouds and the whole cycle starts again.\nThe water cycle is very important to us as it enables us to provide\u00a0two million\u00a0homes\u00a0and businesses in Yorkshire with fresh drinking water every day.\u00a0 Here you can find out more about how we make water work for you.\nCollecting and treating waste water\nHow we collect water\nConsidering the water cycle is truly a cycle, there's no real starting point, but if we had to pick somewhere to begin our exciting journey we'd probably say the sun.\nBefore we can extract the water from rivers, reservoirs and boreholes there are three main steps in the cycle - evaporation, condensation and precipitation:\nEvaporation\nThe sun heats up the water from the oceans where it evaporates and rises into the air as water vapour. The vapour then rises into the earth's atmosphere, along with water transpired from plants and evaporation from the soil. Ask your pupils to think about what happens to a puddle when the sun comes out.\nCondensation\nAs the water vapour rises, the colder temperatures cool the vapour so that it condenses to form water droplets in clouds. Clouds are formed when water droplets and pieces of dust join together in the atmosphere. If it's warm outside ask your pupils to think about why water forms on the outside of a glass when you pour cold water into it. If it's a cold day you could always ask them why water droplets appear on the inside of the window.\nAsk for copies\u00a0of our Water Project booklet to hand out to your pupils - there's fun scientific experiments, puzzles to keep them busy on a rainy day and bite sized facts. Phone a member of the Community Affairs team on 01274 692 548 to order yours.\nPrecipitation\nAs the water vapour condenses the air can't hold it anymore so it falls back to earth as rain, sleet, snow or hail. The word precipitation comes from Latin and means \"falling\". Try asking your pupils to remember the name of this process the next time it rains.\nHere's a fun experiment you can try in the classroom - 'The water cycle in a jar'\nYou'll need:\nA glass or clear plastic jar\nA small plant\nA handful of soil, sand and gravel\nWhat to do:\nSet up your jar with a layer of gravel in the bottom, followed by a layer of sand and a layer of soil.\nPut your plant into the soil, water it well and screw on the lid.\nPut the jar in a sunny place and see how the water cycle works - magic!\nThe water your pupils drink today has been around pretty much as long as the earth has! That means that a Tyrannosaurus Rex, King Arthur or Winston Churchill might have drunk the same water many years ago.\nSources of water\nIt's our job to ensure there's always enough water available for everyone in Yorkshire to use. We use water from three sources - on average 45% comes from reservoirs, 33% from rivers and 22% from groundwater.\nWhich water supply we use is all dependent on location, location, location - the hills of west Yorkshire make an ideal home for reservoirs, whereas in the north we tap into the river network and the flatter east is more at home using groundwater.\nA lot goes on at our water treatment works to make your water safe for drinking. The extent of the treatment varies depending on where we collect the water from - if it's from a borehole the water usually only requires minimal treatment, if it's from lowland river sources and upland reservoirs it will go through a tougher treatment process.\nWhen water reaches our works it will normally go through the following stages to remove the \"baddies\":\nScreening\nThe water passes through a huge metal strainer to remove things like leaves and twigs.\nFlocculation\nApproved chemicals are added to act like a magnet for smaller impurities like dirt, natural colour and bacteria. The chemicals form a sort of jelly called floc.\nWe've developed an interactive guide to water treatment including cool sound effects and animations.\u00a0 Pupils can follow a gang of baddies on their doomed journey through the water treatment works.\nYou can request your copy by phoning us on 01274 692548.\nClarification\nThe floc has to be taken out of the water, so air is bubbled through the tanks to make the floc float to the surface to form a blanket, where it is scraped off. This process is called Dissolved Air Flotation or DAF for short. At some works that don't have DAF, the floc instead sinks to the bottom of the tanks and is taken away - this process is called sedimentation.\nFiltration\nThe clarified water is passed through filters filled with layers of sand and gravel to remove any final traces of the floc and metals such as iron and manganese. These filters are cleaned regularly, every\u00a0one to\u00a0two\u00a0days.\nAsk for some of our\u00a0Education Resource Packs - packed full of great ideas for lessons as well as A3 posters for your classroom.\u00a0\u00a0Please phone us on 01274 692548.\nOzonation\nOzone is a gas which is a powerful oxidant and is used at a few of our water treatment works.\u00a0 It is bubbled through the water to remove any traces of pesticides or similar compounds.\nDownload our fun water cycle poster (1mb)\nGranular Activated Carbon\nGranular Activate Carbon is used in filter beds to remove the by-products of ozonation, as well as traces of any other substances which may also be found in the water.\nChlorination\nChlorine is then added to the water.

The cause, the AP reports, is overgrazing, deforestation, drought and urban sprawl. One has to wonder if climate change shouldn't be added to that list. The tiny dust particles mix with industrial pollution to cause a miserable dust-soot combination that blankets Beijing, working its way into homes through openings as small as a keyhole. The Chinese have tried to fight the problem by planting\u00a0vegetation to hold the soil, but it isn't working. Now they're\u00a0working on plans\u00a0to pump lots of water from the wetter south of the country. Lotsa luck, guys.\n2) The United Nations issued a statement (PDF) pointing out that more people die each year from the lack of clean water than are killed in violence of any kind. Many of these people are children under the age of 5. The UN says that pollution in its traditional forms is responsible for some of these, but so is degradation of watersheds through timber-cutting, covering the ground with hard surfaces that don't allow rainfall to soak in, and other modern practices. Said the UN:\n\"Preventing the pollution of water resources by reducing or eliminating contaminants at the source is almost always the cheapest, easiest and most effective way to protect water quality.\"\n"}, {"score": 1411.8844, "uuid": "5f7f44a3-415f-5d94-8f80-92bd1560408f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0102wb-93-06934", "target_hostname": "www.citywindsor.ca", "target_uri": "http://www.citywindsor.ca/residents/environment/Environmental-Master-Plan/Goal-A-Improve-Our-Air-and-Water-Quality/Pages/Water-Consumption-Indicator.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1774205e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "<em>Water</em> Consumption Indicator", "snippet": " * Use a <em>rain</em> barrel to collect <em>rain</em> <em>water</em> <em>for</em> gardening purposes * <em>Water</em> your lawn only when necessary.

With a nod to the times in which he had found himself, years ago he acquired a title deed for the land his clan had held in trust for God. He now wants to sell portions of the ranch so that he can build a watering hole. A signal that a chapter of a certain way of life is approaching its end, a result of constant uncertainty about the continued presence of water on earth. Life in movement, life of movement interspersed with seasonal halts must change now that society builds fences around rivers, closes ancient lake access, and cover\u2019s nature\u2019s ponds with tarmac.\nThe old man\u2019s livestock are not at home. Ten days ago they left with three of his sons. They crossed the border into Tanzania and are traveling further south to find proverbial greener pastures.\nWe are here to gauge the viability of an acre of land for purchase and ownership. After prerequisite welcomes and appropriate silences, we ask the first of human questions, the one that space explorers ask as they scout the universe for viable real estate:\nIs there water?\nWhere is it?\nHow long has it been here?\nThe old cattleman pauses before pointing out mocking mists shrouding the uneven hills, and a hint of cumulus clouds that will soon fade into blue sky. A difficult question, he murmurs. There are so many changes to the sky, moon, elements, the movement of creatures, the flow of wind, the air, the light of stars, the greening of trees, the waters of the rivers, the reflection of sun. The questions would have been simpler to answer decades ago, he says. He speaks of the persistent appearance of the red star these days. He says, long ago, when the red star showed up, and it was not often, they understood the birth of rain over the land would be a difficult one.\nLife speaks to life, he says in an aside.\nThere is water, he continues. A spring with a buried source. It emerges as a bubble of water close to the top of the highest hill. It transforms into a gush, becoming a clear stream, which vanishes before it reaches the bottom of the hill. In the 1940s a European sojourner\u2014a priest, he suspects\u2014connected a pipe at the waters midway point. The pipe still carries water to the base to this day. This water had never dried up.\u00a0 In that season of 2011, however, it had been reduced to a few large droplets spitting from the pipe. There was no gush, but still, there was water.\nThe cattleman shifts, a small frown deepening the lines of his face, reading the landscape.\nNow the old man talks about small birds, annual migrants\u2014swallows perhaps\u2014which have appeared on that part of the landscape, regular visitors from far, far away. The parent birds appear first and distribute themselves in different trees, where they build their nests, he explains. Maybe a month or two later, little fledglings appear and make their own journey, finding their way to their parents.\nThe wonder of the journey is not the old man\u2019s point. He is grasping at words to convey the obligation to life by life to keep the things of life in consistent flow. Life speaks to life, he repeats. He says that after the birds had settled into their landscape, followed by an array of insects\u2014golden dragonflies, for example\u2014heavy, dark clouds would loom immediately over the land. Thunder, lightning, and the short rains would water the earth.\nAnd now?\nThe cattleman hesitates.\nHis tone softens. He says he thinks things changed as the generations changed. The old ways of reading the land have been replaced by book knowledge, the kind that made it all right for trees to be cut and wood burned and sold as charcoal, so that in less than ten years the land has became a wind-battered plain.\nOne day the traveling birds did not show up as they had done before. Soon, the habit of waiting for the birds also died away. The birds, he explains, like frogs that used to surface from beneath the dust, were known as the rain-bringers.\nHe says he hopes the books that children read will explain what should happen next. He has decided, though, not to wait. He shall dig a large and wide watering hole into his land. He will pray for rain to fill it up.\nMeanwhile?\nSilence.\nLater. Waiting for rain-converted Nairobi water to gush through a kitchen tap\u2019s sputtering steel mouth. Outside, star-filled skies; a red planet is a far point in backlit darkness. Tomorrow, as today, will be a bright and sunny day. Few clouds, no rain.\nPosted in\n"}, {"score": 1409.9174, "uuid": "0bd006b3-553d-53e2-b824-245fd2eb0041", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1200tw-74-14957", "target_hostname": "www.good.is", "target_uri": "http://www.good.is/post/water-water-everywhere-a-memory-of-water-in-the-nairobi-river-basin/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "<em>Water</em>, <em>Water</em> Everywhere: A Memory of <em>Water</em> in the Nairobi River Basin -", "snippet": "In the Roman Empire, earthen jars filled with naturally carbonated <em>water</em> from...

Life in movement, life of movement interspersed with seasonal halts must change now that society builds fences around rivers, closes ancient lake access, and cover\u2019s nature\u2019s ponds with tarmac.\nThe old man\u2019s livestock are not at home. Ten days ago they left with three of his sons. They crossed the border into Tanzania and are traveling further south to find proverbial greener pastures.\nWe are here to gauge the viability of an acre of land for purchase and ownership. After prerequisite welcomes and appropriate silences, we ask the first of human questions, the one that space explorers ask as they scout the universe for viable real estate:\nIs there water?\nWhere is it?\nHow long has it been here?\nThe old cattleman pauses before pointing out mocking mists shrouding the uneven hills, and a hint of cumulus clouds that will soon fade into blue sky. A difficult question, he murmurs. There are so many changes to the sky, moon, elements, the movement of creatures, the flow of wind, the air, the light of stars, the greening of trees, the waters of the rivers, the reflection of sun. The questions would have been simpler to answer decades ago, he says. He speaks of the persistent appearance of the red star these days. He says, long ago, when the red star showed up, and it was not often, they understood the birth of rain over the land would be a difficult one.\nLife speaks to life, he says in an aside.\nThere is water, he continues. A spring with a buried source. It emerges as a bubble of water close to the top of the highest hill. It transforms into a gush, becoming a clear stream, which vanishes before it reaches the bottom of the hill. In the 1940s a European sojourner\u2014a priest, he suspects\u2014connected a pipe at the waters midway point. The pipe still carries water to the base to this day. This water had never dried up.\u00a0 In that season of 2011, however, it had been reduced to a few large droplets spitting from the pipe. There was no gush, but still, there was water.\nThe cattleman shifts, a small frown deepening the lines of his face, reading the landscape.\nNow the old man talks about small birds, annual migrants\u2014swallows perhaps\u2014which have appeared on that part of the landscape, regular visitors from far, far away. The parent birds appear first and distribute themselves in different trees, where they build their nests, he explains. Maybe a month or two later, little fledglings appear and make their own journey, finding their way to their parents.\nThe wonder of the journey is not the old man\u2019s point. He is grasping at words to convey the obligation to life by life to keep the things of life in consistent flow. Life speaks to life, he repeats. He says that after the birds had settled into their landscape, followed by an array of insects\u2014golden dragonflies, for example\u2014heavy, dark clouds would loom immediately over the land. Thunder, lightning, and the short rains would water the earth.\nAnd now?\nThe cattleman hesitates.\nHis tone softens. He says he thinks things changed as the generations changed. The old ways of reading the land have been replaced by book knowledge, the kind that made it all right for trees to be cut and wood burned and sold as charcoal, so that in less than ten years the land has became a wind-battered plain.\nOne day the traveling birds did not show up as they had done before. Soon, the habit of waiting for the birds also died away. The birds, he explains, like frogs that used to surface from beneath the dust, were known as the rain-bringers.\nHe says he hopes the books that children read will explain what should happen next. He has decided, though, not to wait. He shall dig a large and wide watering hole into his land. He will pray for rain to fill it up.\nMeanwhile?\nSilence.\nLater. Waiting for rain-converted Nairobi water to gush through a kitchen tap\u2019s sputtering steel mouth. Outside, star-filled skies; a red planet is a far point in backlit darkness. Tomorrow, as today, will be a bright and sunny day. Few clouds, no rain.\nPosted in\n"}, {"score": 1408.457, "uuid": "54852897-e802-586e-812d-3ba0991d8994", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1314wb-59-11316", "target_hostname": "groksurf.com", "target_uri": "http://groksurf.com/tag/twin-oaks-water-treatment-plant/", "page_rank": 1.1864933e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Twin Oaks <em>Water</em> Treatment <em>Plant</em> \u00ab GrokSurf&#x27;s San Diego", "snippet": "statewide <em>water</em> news, you won&#x27;t find <em>better</em> sources <em>than</em> Aquafornia and Brown &amp; Caldwell <em>Water</em> News.", "explanation": null, "document": "Comments (RSS)\nGrokSurf's San Diego by George J.

I went on this tour to get a closer look at the infrastructure that contributes a large amount of water that San Diego needs to import to stay alive.\nSan Diego imports about 90% of its water and a good deal of that comes from the Colorado River. It\u2019s one thing to casually acknowledge our dependence on the river, but there\u2019s nothing like getting a close look at some of the engineering that goes into maintaining this immense system.\nStops along the way included San Vicente Reservoir, Twin Oaks Valley Water Treatment Plant, Diamond Valley Lake, Copper Basin, the Whitsett Intake Pumping Plant, Parker Dam, the All-American Canal and Palo Verde Irrigation District farmlands.\nOn to the pictures (clickable for enlargements).\nWe began the tour at San Vicente Dam, where a project to raise the dam by 117 feet using a roller-compacted concrete technique is underway. When the dam raise is completed, the dam\u2019s capacity will increase from 90,000 to 242,000 acre-feet.\nI took this shot a few months ago, when they were water blasting the dam's face to prepare the surface\nSurface is all clean now, ready for new concrete.

Turn on a tap or flush a toilet, and there\u2019s water at your fingertips. People carry it around in trendy bottles. It even mechanically pops out of the ground from sprinklers! But for some, there\u2019s not a drop to drink.\nSubmitted 11/3/2006 By trappleton Views 128682 Comments 15 Updated 2/21/2007\nPhotographer : Yujie\nThough it may not seem like it, there is a very limited supply of fresh water on this planet. Earth is mostly covered in water, but 97% of its supply is salty ocean water, and not suitable for drinking. The rest isn't very accessible either, with nearly three-quarters either frozen in polar ice caps or present as ground moisture. Less than 1% of the world's water is in freshwater lakes and rivers.\nWith the world population more than 6 billion and growing, this is presenting quite a problem. More than 1.1 billion people worldwide do not have adequate drinking water, and more than double that are without adequate water for sanitation. This is thought to be the leading cause of death worldwide, and could account for as much as 80% of all human illnesses. More than 3,900 children die each day due to diarrhoea caused by lack of water.\nAustralia, being the driest continent, is also feeling the effects of water shortage. Australian farmers are experiencing the worst drought in Australian history, which will have devastating effects on food supplies and the economy -- not to mention their personal lives. On average, every four days, another Australian farmer commits suicide, according to Australian Divisions of General Practice chairman Tony Hobbs.\nThe problem isn't going to get better anytime soon, either. The UN estimates that by 2025, more than two thirds of the world -- about 4.6 billion people by then -- will not have adequate water. This won't just be in third world nations, either; it is estimated that Adelaide's drinking water will be below World Health Organisation safety levels two days out of five.\nAs the crisis escalates, the potential for violence rises as well. When a group of people is without water, nothing else seems more important. Wars might not be fought over oil or territory, but to quench thirst. In 2000, Meir Ben Meir, the former Israeli Water Commissioner, said, \"I can promise that if there is not sufficient water in our region, if there is scarcity of water, if people remain thirsty for water, then we shall doubtless face war.\"\nSteps are being taken to improve conditions, but more needs to be done. Developed nations need to help their underdeveloped neighbours build waste water treatment plants, and those with adequate water supplies need to conserve water better.\nYou can help in this effort yourself. You've probably been advised to turn off the tap when brushing your teeth, but there's even more: try taking shorter showers, and using the half-flush on the toilet when possible. You may even consider purchasing a rain barrel to store rainwater that can later be used in the garden. For every inch of rain that falls on your roof, thousands of gallons of water are rolling down your driveway, unused. With lots of us acting towards one goal, these many little changes will make a huge difference\nHow do I know this?\nABC News Online, Farmer suicide rates worry GPs, http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200610/s1771783.htm\nMelbourne Water, Australia, the driest continent, http://conservewater.melbournewater.com.au/content/driest.asp\nMiller c 2003, 'Time to act on global water crisis: forum', The Age, 17\u00a0March, http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/16/1047749663664.html\nUN Water for Life, Meeting global targets for water and sanitation, http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/factsheet.html\nWikipedia free Encyclopaedia, Water crisis, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_crisis\nDiscuss Now\nTillyHinton 28-Apr-2008\nThe water crisis is hitting hard in South-East Queensland, where residents of the Mary Valley north of Brisbane yesterday marked the second anniversary of the Qld Govt's announcement that the Mary River would be dammed at Traveston Crossing, inundating an area 1.3 times the size of Sydney Harbour, destroying habitat of 7 threatened species, submerging highly-productive farmland and dislocating communities.\nI'm all for addressing the water crisis, but not by old technology of mega-dams which do far more harm than good.\nI hope you'll check out http://www.facebook.com/pages/Save-the-Mary-River/...\nYuilden 22-Apr-2008\n\"With the world population more than 6 billion and growing, this is presenting quite a problem.

Lets see you have a limited resource in water with ever growing populations. Ill point to the elephant and say how stupid it is to focus on saving the people when it will mean an even bigger crapfight in the future when the water is even more depleted. Oh no, we couldn't possibly have another Rwanda!! - it happened because of natural limits...Its the future, you think China or India can keep double cropping every year indefinitely - all the while drawing out more groundwater, polluting more and have the shrinking water flows off the Himalayans?\nWe're not great in Australia - place called Nullaware (its tiny) near from where i was from you see the greenest grass, they pretty much irrigate year round - sure they had plenty of bore water. Then theres the fruit basket around the water - sure the fruits are nice but they are water intensive while the Murray languishes.\nHere's some positive ideas then.\nPlant deeprooted grasses and trees that can pump their own water up.\nGrow less water needy plants.\nUse the aquifer as a respectfully - draw it off slower than it replenishes, then when the drought hits there is still a reserve.\nDont overcrop/overgraze.\nWe also shouldnt export our water so much - in terms of being a world breadbasket.\nCourse its all political - farmers in general do not like to be told what to do and to garner a profit they need to work the land as hard. I'm not clumping them all together because often they farm sustainably but im talking sustainability long term, not the lifespan of the farmer.\nI found the Israeli water minister quote amusing, i vaguely recall the king of Jordan saying the same thing - that water would be the only issue he would go to war with Israel over.\n-----\nCMatloub 26-Mar-2008\nI think there should be restrictions places on water grass, but not just during times when there are water shortages, I think these should be in place at all time!

Water saving tips\nMulch your garden and reuse greywater\nA quarter of our household water is used outdoors on the garden or lawn. By spreading mulch over your soil, you can reduce the amount of water wasted through evaporation by around 70%. Make mulch from leaves, grass clippings, newspapers, bark or just about any other organic matter, or buy it from a nursery or garden supplier.\nYour plants don\u2019t need drinking quality water like you do, so reuse water from the laundry and the bathroom. A bucket in the shower and a hose from the washing machine is a good start, or get your plumber to install a greywater diverter.\nPrevent water dripping\nA dripping tap can waste over 20,000 litres of water a year and usually means that a washer needs replacing. This is simple to fix \u2026 all you need is a tap spanner and a replacement washer. A leaky toilet that is constantly hissing can waste up to 100,000 litres a year. Fixing a leaking toilet can be a bit tricky, so contact a licensed plumber.\nInstal dual-flush toilets and water efficient appliances.\nA half flush uses 3 litres, full flush just 4.5 in the latest water-efficient models, much less than an old standard cistern which uses 11 litres \u2013 and unless your toilet is plumbed into your rainwater tank or greywater system, this is treated drinking water from our dams being flushed down your toilet. Choose a dual flush toilet with at least a four-star water efficiency rating and save 28,000- 42,000 litres per year or $35-$53 from your water bill. If you\u2019re stuck with a single flush toilet, you can still save water. Place two 2-litre plastic bottles filled with water in the cistern to displace water and reduce the flush to 7 litres, or install a flush regulator that stops flushing when you do.\nWater-efficient appliances: when you buy a washing machine or dishwasher, check the water efficiency star rating \u2013 the more stars, the more water efficient. An old washing machine wastes 50-100 litres every wash.\nInstal water-efficient showerheads and aerators\nFor as little as $20, you can save as much as $100 on your water bill: efficient shower heads (three stars or more) use only 7-9 litres per minute while traditional showerheads use 20-30 litres! Make sure your taps have aerators fitted (you can buy them from hardware or plumbing shops). They simply screw on, cost as little as $5 and cut your tap flow in half by mixing in air to maintain pressure.\nRemember you can still waste a lot of water even under an efficient showerhead \u2013 save some water by limiting your shower time.\nThe single biggest water saver you can buy is a rainwater tank.\nYour roof is more efficient than a dry dam catchment, and will collect water from the smallest rain shower. A tank for the garden will help keep things green when water restrictions stop you using mains water, but much more water can be saved by connecting the tank to the toilet, laundry and hot water systems, or the whole house. Tanks come in all shapes and sizes, fitting along walls or under floors if space is tight. Prices start around $700 and rebates can cut the cost of saving water in half. For more information on rainwater tanks talk to a Green plumber or Enviro plumber .\nRegister for a free DIY Water Saving Kit\n2. Mind the water restrictions\nWater restrictions may be in force in your area. Your local council is the best place to find out what restrictions apply, however, as a guide you may find:\n- Hand-held hosing of lawns and gardens and drip irrigation is allowed only on certain days, usually before 10 am and after 4 pm\n- No other watering systems or sprinklers are to be used at any time\n- Restrictions on when and how you can fill new or renovated pools\n- No hosing of hard surfaces including vehicles at any time\n- No hoses or taps to be left running unattended, except when filling pools or containers\n- Fire hoses must only be used for fire fighting purposes, not for cleaning.\nRecycled water, bore water and water used for testing fire systems, fire fighting and related activities are excluded from restrictions.\nFines may apply for all breaches of water restrictions by individuals. .\nCorporations may also face a fine for each breach.\nSome things that may still permitted at any time, even during water restrictions, include:\n- Using a bucket or watering can to wash and rinse vehicles or water lawns and gardens.\n- Topping up any existing swimming pool.\n- Using water from a rainwater tank, as long as it is not connected to or topped up from Water mains.\n- Using a hose with a trigger nozzle or high pressure cleaning device to clean boat bilges and boat trailer brakes and wheels.\n- Using a hose to flush boat engines.\n- Cleaning garbage bins using a hose fitted with a trigger nozzle or with an on/off switch. This should be done within an official bin wash area or on grass.\n3.

Turn on a tap or flush a toilet, and there\u2019s water at your fingertips. People carry it around in trendy bottles. It even mechanically pops out of the ground from sprinklers! But for some, there\u2019s not a drop to drink.\nSubmitted 11/3/2006 By trappleton Views 127679 Comments 15 Updated 2/21/2007\nPhotographer : Yujie\nThough it may not seem like it, there is a very limited supply of fresh water on this planet. Earth is mostly covered in water, but 97% of its supply is salty ocean water, and not suitable for drinking. The rest isn't very accessible either, with nearly three-quarters either frozen in polar ice caps or present as ground moisture. Less than 1% of the world's water is in freshwater lakes and rivers.\nWith the world population more than 6 billion and growing, this is presenting quite a problem. More than 1.1 billion people worldwide do not have adequate drinking water, and more than double that are without adequate water for sanitation. This is thought to be the leading cause of death worldwide, and could account for as much as 80% of all human illnesses. More than 3,900 children die each day due to diarrhoea caused by lack of water.\nAustralia, being the driest continent, is also feeling the effects of water shortage. Australian farmers are experiencing the worst drought in Australian history, which will have devastating effects on food supplies and the economy -- not to mention their personal lives. On average, every four days, another Australian farmer commits suicide, according to Australian Divisions of General Practice chairman Tony Hobbs.\nThe problem isn't going to get better anytime soon, either. The UN estimates that by 2025, more than two thirds of the world -- about 4.6 billion people by then -- will not have adequate water. This won't just be in third world nations, either; it is estimated that Adelaide's drinking water will be below World Health Organisation safety levels two days out of five.\nAs the crisis escalates, the potential for violence rises as well. When a group of people is without water, nothing else seems more important. Wars might not be fought over oil or territory, but to quench thirst. In 2000, Meir Ben Meir, the former Israeli Water Commissioner, said, \"I can promise that if there is not sufficient water in our region, if there is scarcity of water, if people remain thirsty for water, then we shall doubtless face war.\"\nSteps are being taken to improve conditions, but more needs to be done. Developed nations need to help their underdeveloped neighbours build waste water treatment plants, and those with adequate water supplies need to conserve water better.\nYou can help in this effort yourself. You've probably been advised to turn off the tap when brushing your teeth, but there's even more: try taking shorter showers, and using the half-flush on the toilet when possible. You may even consider purchasing a rain barrel to store rainwater that can later be used in the garden. For every inch of rain that falls on your roof, thousands of gallons of water are rolling down your driveway, unused. With lots of us acting towards one goal, these many little changes will make a huge difference\nHow do I know this?\nABC News Online, Farmer suicide rates worry GPs, http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200610/s1771783.htm\nMelbourne Water, Australia, the driest continent, http://conservewater.melbournewater.com.au/content/driest.asp\nMiller c 2003, 'Time to act on global water crisis: forum', The Age, 17\u00a0March, http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/16/1047749663664.html\nUN Water for Life, Meeting global targets for water and sanitation, http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/factsheet.html\nWikipedia free Encyclopaedia, Water crisis, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_crisis\nDiscuss Now\nTillyHinton 28-Apr-2008\nThe water crisis is hitting hard in South-East Queensland, where residents of the Mary Valley north of Brisbane yesterday marked the second anniversary of the Qld Govt's announcement that the Mary River would be dammed at Traveston Crossing, inundating an area 1.3 times the size of Sydney Harbour, destroying habitat of 7 threatened species, submerging highly-productive farmland and dislocating communities.\nI'm all for addressing the water crisis, but not by old technology of mega-dams which do far more harm than good.\nI hope you'll check out http://www.facebook.com/pages/Save-the-Mary-River/...\nYuilden 22-Apr-2008\n\"With the world population more than 6 billion and growing, this is presenting quite a problem.

Lets see you have a limited resource in water with ever growing populations. Ill point to the elephant and say how stupid it is to focus on saving the people when it will mean an even bigger crapfight in the future when the water is even more depleted. Oh no, we couldn't possibly have another Rwanda!! - it happened because of natural limits...Its the future, you think China or India can keep double cropping every year indefinitely - all the while drawing out more groundwater, polluting more and have the shrinking water flows off the Himalayans?\nWe're not great in Australia - place called Nullaware (its tiny) near from where i was from you see the greenest grass, they pretty much irrigate year round - sure they had plenty of bore water.

An international day to celebrate freshwater was recommended at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). The United Nations General Assembly responded by designating 22 March 1993 as the first World Water Day. Each year, World Water Day highlights a specific aspect of freshwater. On this page, we present a brief overview of the different themes that have been the focus of World Water Day celebrations. The objective of World Water Day 2011 was to focus international attention on the impact of rapid urban population growth, industrialization and uncertainties caused by climate change, conflicts and natural disasters on urban water systems. The theme, Water for cities: responding to the urban challenge, aimed to spotlight and encourage governments, organizations, communities, and individuals to actively engage in addressing the challenges of urban water management. The offical website attracted a new high of over half a million visits in the month of March, and saw over 800 events added to the 'Worldwide Events' map. The offical logo was also produced in over 40 languages.

When washing dishes by hand, don't let the water run while rinsing. Fill one sink with wash water and the other with rinse water. Some refrigerators, air conditioners and ice-makers are cooled with wasted flows of water. Consider upgrading with air-cooled appliances for significant water savings. Adjust sprinklers so only your lawn is watered and not the house, sidewalk, or street. Run your clothes washer and dishwasher only when they are full. You can save up to 1,000 gallons a month. Choose shrubs and groundcovers instead of turf for hard-to-water areas such as steep slopes and isolated strips. Install covers on pools and spas and check for leaks around your pumps. Use the garbage disposal sparingly. Compost vegetable food waste instead and save gallons every time. Plant in the fall when conditions are cooler and rainfall is more plentiful. For cold drinks keep a pitcher of water in the refrigerator instead of running the tap. This way, every drop goes down you and not the drain. Monitor your water bill for unusually high use. Your bill and water meter are tools that can help you discover leaks. Water your lawn and garden in the morning or evening when temperatures are cooler to minimize evaporation. Wash your fruits and vegetables in a pan of water instead of running water from the tap. Spreading a layer of organic mulch around plants retains moisture and saves water, time and money. Use a broom instead of a hose to clean your driveway and sidewalk and save water every time. If your shower fills a one-gallon bucket in less than 20 seconds, replace the showerhead with a water-efficient model. Collect the water you use for rinsing fruits and vegetables, then reuse it to water houseplants. If water runs off your lawn easily, split your watering time into shorter periods to allow for better absorption. We're more likely to notice leaks indoors, but don't forget to check outdoor faucets, sprinkl\n6\nThis will take a moment, please be patient...\nUN-Water Seminar World Water Day 2012 Water and Food Security: Call for Solutions\nUN-Water\nSource : FAO: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, for a world without hunger\nThe World Water Day in 2012 is intended to draw the international attention on the relationships between water & food security. \u201cFood security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\u201d and water is one of the fundamental input factor to the food production.\n7\nWorld Water Day 2012, Reuse.

A KEY ISSUE FOR SUSTAINABLE \"INTEGRATED\" CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT.\nFrancesc Gallart and Pilar Llorens\nInstitute of Earth Sciences \"Jaume Almera\" (CSIC), Barcelona, Spain\n\"Integrated catchment management\" is easier said than done. Sometimes it is merely an offer-demand study that considers that the catchment is just a system of reservoirs, pipes and taps. Hydrology became just an appendix of applied statistics, evolving into a more sophisticated but scientifically empty information technology. An example of the need for integrative approaches may be taken from Spain.\nThere are many evidences of water resources diminution in different parts of Spain for the last 70 years, representing in average about 0.4% per year. This diminution has been claimed to be the result of the increasing irrigation and climate variability. Indeed, the observed reduction in discharge may be partly explained by the increment of the irrigation surface in downstream areas, but the assessment of the water balance for the Ebro catchment shows that there is still a significant decrease of rainfall-runoff relationship after consideration of the increase of water abstractions. Furthermore, most of the headwater areas show decreasing trends that can not be explained only considering climate variability.\nThe findings of experimental hydrology obtained along the 20 century demonstrated that changes in land cover determine different water consumption in the catchments, and therefore changes in water resources. Water resource assessment in Spain can not be made without taking into account the relevant increase of forest cover occurred in headwater areas during the last 50 years, as a result of land abandonment as well as environmental and agricultural policies. Conversely, land management can not be made without considering the hydrological implications of land cover change.\nThe above example illustrates that the interdependence of water and land must be taken into account for true \u00ebIntegrated catchment management\u00ed. Non-irrigated rural areas (forests, rangelands and dry-farming areas) have also water requirements, directly taken from precipitation, that must also considered in the catchment water budget.\n-KEYNOTE LECTURE-\nASSESSING THE EFFECT OF CLIMATE OSCILLATIONS AND LAND-USE CHANGES ON THE AVAILABILITY OF WATER RESOURCES IN MOUNTAIN MEDITERRANEAN AREAS\nSantiago Beguer\u00eda, Juan Ignacio L\u00f3pez-Moreno, Adri\u00e1n Lorente, Manuel Seeger & Jos\u00e9 M. Garc\u00eda-Ruiz\nInstituto Pirenaico de Ecolog\u00eda, CSIC, Zaragoza, Spain\nIn Mediterranean areas, mountains have an extreme importance from a hydrological point of view, since they behave as humidity islands. This is the reason why most of the discharge of the Mediterranean rivers comes from the headwaters, sometimes located at more than 2000 m a.s.l. This allowed in the past the development and progressive enlargement of irrigated areas. In the Ebro Depression, for example, irrigation of semi-arid areas has been, since the roman times, the solution for introducing a diversity of crops and for ensuring a much higher productivity, both in the main river (the Ebro River) and in its tributaries. During the 20th century a dramatic increase of irrigated areas has occurred, far away from the fluvial channels, by means of large reservoirs and a complex network of waterways. This evolution, together with the urban growth and the process of industrialization, obligate to carefully manage the water resources and to know -and even forecast- their temporal oscillations.\nA recent evaluation of water resources in the Central Spanish Pyrenees has demonstrated that there are frequent, positive and negative oscillations around the average. The last negative oscillation started at the beginning of the 60's, and though it has not been the deepest of the 20th century, it has no precedent due to its length. A regional analysis of precipitation and discharge anomalies shows that there is a close parallelism between both variables. Nevertheless, since 1965 the decrease in discharge is faster than the decrease in precipitation. This could be explained by the evolution of temperature, which shows a positive trend since the 70's, but there is evidence that its role is relatively limited. The evolution of land uses and plant cover could help to interpret the increasing separationbetween the curve of precipitation and that of discharge. During the 20th century, most of the hillslope cultivated fields have been abandoned and recolonised by dense communities of shrubs; likewise, many old grazed areas and abandoned fields have been afforested with pines. In the water balance, interception and direct water consumption have increased very much, in such a manner that less water is available to become surface or groundwater runoff. Floods have also reduced their frequency and intensity, thus affecting the management patterns of reservoirs.\n-CLOSENING LECTURE-\nSEDIMENTATION IN RESERVOIRS: A CHALLENGE FOR WATER SUSTAINABILITY\nBlas L. Valero-Garc\u00e9s\nInstituto Pirenaico de Ecolog\u00eda, CSIC, Zaragoza, Spain\nThe importance of reservoirs is likely to increase over time as population, economic activity, and irrigation demands grow. More than 39000 dams higher than 15 m were reported in the world in 1996, although the number of smaller impoundments is several times higher. Agricultural communities and industrial, developed urban areasare heavily dependent on reservoir water supply.In most regions, reservoirs are the single most important component of the regulated water supply system. Most of these structures have been designed totrap sediments continuously with an average usable life of about 100 years.\nSedimentation in reservoirs has large consequences for the rivers, the impoundments, and the associated hydraulic structures, but the single most important is the loss of waterstorage capacity. The loss of water storage capacity caused by sediment accumulation makes reservoirskeynon-sustainable components of the water supply systems. The estimated annual lost water storage capacity worldwide is about 1 %, however there is a great range of siltation rates. The geographical, geological, geomorphological , and ecological characteristics of the watershed are significant factors for erosion and sediment sources. The climate and the rivers hydrological regime greatly affect sediment deliver. Human activities and changes in land uses are also significant controls on reservoir siltation. Finally, reservoir management practices can mitigate or increase siltation.\nThe traditional management of reservoirs does not consider the sustainable use of these structures. Large water flows and measures to mitigate watershed erosion are used to span the usable life of a reservoir. Due to the high cost of elimination of sediments, siltation has to be considered as a non-reversible process. A new philosophy for sustainable management of reservoirs has to focus on controlling the sediment accumulation. Water sustainability requires that the traditional concept of limited (< 100 years) reservoir usable life be replaced with a longer -termperspective on sustainable use. A balance between water quantity and quality available to human communities and preservation of biodiversity should be achieved, to protect the environment and conserve resources.\nThe 21th century will witness the loss of over half of present reservoir capacity in many regions. Siltation of reservoir is not a problem to be solved by future generations, but an urgent need for sustainable development. Spain has the largest number of reservoirs in the EU, but siltation during the last decades is becoming a major concern for the limited waterresources. Due to the geographical and climaticdiversity of Spain, the average sediment yieldis very variable, although is higher in the southern Spanish basins and lower in the Pyrenees. Detailed sedimentological studies of reservoirs and watershed provide high resolution depositional histories to define erosion, transport and sedimentation processes in drainage basins. The influence of antropogenic, climatic and other greographic factors on sediment transport and delivery can be evaluated within this integrated framework.\nHYDROLOGICAL EFFECTS OF DAMS IN THE EBRO RIVER\nR.J. Batalla(1), C.M. G\u00f3mez(2) & G.M. Kondolf,(3)\n(1) Departament de Medi Ambient i Ci\u00e8ncies del S\u00f2l, Universitat de Lleida\n(2) Departamento de Fundamentos de Econom\u00eda e Historia Econ\u00f3mica, Universidad de Alcal\u00e1 de Henares\n(3) Department of Landscape Architecture, University of California, Berkeley\nWe comprehensively assessed 20th century hydrological alterations from reservoirs ranging from 2 to 1,500 hm3 in capacity in the Ebro River basin by analysing thirty-eight flow records for twenty rivers. Most rivers show substantial reductions in flood magnitude as a consequence of dam operation, with greater hydrologic change associated with higher Impounded Runoff index (IR), defined as the ratio between reservoir capacity and annual runoff. Post -dam peak flows were reduced from pre-dam flood peaks, on average, by 33% for the 2-year flood, 28% for the 10-year flood, and 23% for the 50-year floods. Reservoir effects were greater in the eastern, drier portion of the basin, where same IR produces twice the flood reduction as in the west.Post-dam flows show reductions in mean daily flows, reflecting net abstractions from the river, mostly for irrigation, and reductions in flow variability, reflecting reservoir regulation. Most series reveal severe flow reductions (40%) in flows equalled or exceeded 50% of the time (Q50).Low flows (Q95) are the most affected, being reduced, on average, to half. Flow Standard Deviation index indicates reduction of flow variability from 12% to 90% in some flow records.A correlation coefficient [1 ? rx,y ? -1] measuring the relation between post and pre-dam monthly flows is used to assess alterations on river regime. Mean rx,y is 0.67, suggesting a general moderate effect of reservoirs. Values range from -0.84 (Ebro River downstream Ebro dam) to 0.95 for less dammed rivers. Results show a threshold IR around 50%, suggesting an acceleration of dams\u0092 effects on river regime once the dam is able to capture half of annual runoff. Downstream reaches of the Ebro River had a significant reduction in the mean annual runoff (-30%) between 1960 and 1992. Impounded runoff was already 2 km3 in 1960 and 4,3 km3 in 1975, 15% and 32% of annual runoff respectively. Reduction in annual runoff had probably already started before the sixties but unusually wet years at the beginning of the decade masked immediate effects of dams on water yield. Several other rivers also show significant reductions (20% to 70%) on annual runoff after dams got in operation.\nResults of this study suggest that construction of additional irrigation impoundments, as proposed in the New Spanish Hydrological Plan, will likely have substantial effects on river geomorphology and ecology, because they will further reduce flows, diminish sediment transport, alter river-bed structure and degrade water quality.\nSEASONAL VARIABILITY OF SUSPENDED SEDIMENT TRANSPORT IN AN ABANDONED FARMLAND CATCHMENT, CENTRAL SPANISH PYRENEES\nS. Beguer\u00eda (1), J.M. Garc\u00eda-Ruiz (1), J. Arn\u00e1ez (2), A. Lorente (1), M. Seeger (1) & C. Mart\u00ed-Bono (1)\n(1) Instituto Pirenaico de Ecolog\u00eda, CSIC, Campus de Aula Dei, Apartado 202, 50080-Zaragoza, Spain.\n(2) Department of Geography, University of La Rioja, 26004-Logro\u00f1o, Spain.\nThe Arn\u00e1s experimental catchment is located in the Upper Arag\u00f3n River Basin. It has an area of 250 ha and is occupied by old cultivated fields, already abandoned 40 years ago. At present, the old fields are subject to a process of plant colonisation, mainly with dense shrubs. The catchment has been monitored since 1996 in order to obtain continuous information on precipitation, temperature, discharge and sediment transport (solutes, suspended sediment and bedload). This paper studies the relationships between floods and suspended sediment transport. Main rainstorms and floods occur in autumn and spring, though some short, intense rainstorms are possible in summer. The results obtained show that suspended sediment transport is related not only to the intensity of precipitation and peak flow, but also to the state of soil humidity.\nA NUMERICAL MODEL OF DEBRIS FLOW\nP. Brufau & P. Garc\u00eda-Navarro\nFluid Mechanics, C.P.S., University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain\nIn mountain torrents, intense and localised storms may cause flash floods with important sediment transport. In steep torrents, the sediment discharge may increase so that the solid concentration often exceeds figures of 40-50 %. This is the case of the debris flows that transport downstream huge volumes of sediments that are then deposited on the alluvial fans, often highly populated. These wide areas are periodically exposed to catastrophic events. To reduce the debris flow hazard, it is common to couple structural and non structural protections such as zoning of the risk prone areas and emergency plans. Protection plans require the description of scenarios that can be defined only by means of simulations with mathematical models. Debris flow is modelled using the equations governing the dynamics of a liquid-solid mixture. These equations have a structure similar to those of the monophasic water flow, differing from them by the presence of some terms characteristic of the bifasic nature of the mixture, such as granular bed erosion velocity, sediment concentration, bed shear stress, etc.The set of equations includes two mass conservation equations (one for the mixture and another for the solid phase) and a single momentum balance equation of the flow. The friction term is simulated according to Takahashi (1991). The system is completed with equations to estimate the erosion/deposition rate derived from the Egashira and Ashida (1987) or Takahashi (1991) relationships. An upwind explicit finite volume numerical model based on first order Roe's scheme for unsteady debris flow is presented. The advection equation of the coarse solid fraction is solved in cascade at each time step after the momentum balance equation of the mixture has been integrated. The model will be applied to simulate different test conditions in channels with simple geometry and some comparison with laboratory experiments are presented. A one-dimensional scheme is proposed whilst a two-dimensional scheme for the more complex wave propagation on alluvial fans will be developed in future work.\nCLIMATE CHANGE AND WATER RESOURCES IN IRELAND\nRo Charlton, Sonja Moore, John Sweeney, Rowan Fealy\nDepartment of Geography, National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM), Maynooth,Co. Kildare, Ireland\nPredictions are made of changes in effective runoff at a high spatial resolution for the island of Ireland under different climate change scenarios.Although previous studies have examined the response of selected Irish catchments to various climate change scenarios this is the first time that the whole area of the island has been considered.GCM model output from HadCM3 for 2 x CO2 is downscaled and further refined using recent research on Irish climate change to develop reference scenarios.This is complemented by an alternative approach based on circulation / precipitation yield relationships.These temperature and rainfall scenarios are incorporated into a spatial grid (10 x 10 km) of Irish climatology derived for current conditions.The spatially resolved climate scenario data is used to drive a hydrological model, HYSIM, applied to the spatial grid.\nThe gridded baseline climatology is used to validate the effective runoff predicted by HYSIM.Individual grid cells are parameterised using soil survey and CORINE land use data together with information on major aquifers provided by the Geological Survey of Ireland.The flexible data requirements of HYSIM allow some representation of the diverse hydrological conditions found within Ireland.For example, approximately 40% of Ireland is underlain by limestones, many of which are karstified.These karst aquifers are an important water resource and respond very rapidly to precipitation.There are also extensive areas of lakes and wetlands.The land area is divided into broad hydrological zones to provide some representation of this variability.Results from the simulations under future climatic scenarios are discussed.\nTHE EFFECT OF LAND MANAGEMENT ON SOIL MOISTURE IN THE CENTRAL SPANISH PYRENEES\nM.P. Errea (1), A. Cerd\u00e1 (1), T. Lasanta (1) & L. Ortigosa (2)\n(1) Instituto Pirenaico de Ecolog\u00eda (CSIC), Zaragoza.\n(2) Dpt. of Geography, Universidad de La Rioja, Logro\u00f1o, Spain.\nThe European mountainous areas, such as the Pyrenees, have suffered important land use changes since the XIX century. There, the land abandonment developed a landscape characterised by a mosaic of different land-uses. These changes affect the vegetation recovery process and then the runoff and sediment production. Although, soil moisture plays an important role in the hydrological cycle, very little is know about his behaviour in a changing environment such as the Pyrenees. Soil moisture influences the runoff and infiltration processes and then the sediment detachment. Moreover, soil moisture also determines the vegetation recovery and soil development after abandonment.\nThis paper aims to study the influence of land-use and season on the soil moisture. Measurements were carried out weekly during 1997 and 1998 by means of the Time Domain Reflectrometry method.\nThe selected land-uses were Cereal (fertilised and with artiga management), Fallow, Grassland (fertilised and with artiga management), Burnt(two plots under different post-fire recovery conditions), and the Control plot which is a dense Scrubland.\nThe result shows that land-use is a key factor in the seasonal and spatial variability of soil moisture. Plant cover was found to favours greater soil moisture content such as was found on the Scrubland plot. The ploughed plots showed the lowest soil moisture content. Differences between the fallow and the Cereal plots were negligible. Seasonally, the greatest differences amongst land-uses were found during the summer, the hottest and the driest season at the study area. These conditions determined that the ploughed soils reached extremely low soil moisture values.\nVARIABILITY AND NON?LINEAR PREDICTION OF STREAM FLOWS INTO THE EL PE\u00d1OL HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT, COLOMBIA.\nC.D. Hoyos (1), O. Mesa (1), G. Poveda (1), P. Waylen (2).\n1. Posgrado en Recursos Hidr\u00e1ulicos, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Medell\u00edn, Colombia.\n2.

The El Pe\u00d2ol scheme on the Nare River is the country\u00eds largest providing roughly 14% of national production.The region isparticularly susceptible to droughts during warm phases of ENSO, however stream flow inputs are also subject to a variety of regional and local factors other than ENSO, which may makes forecasting difficult.The identification of a model which permits the reliable incorporation ofreadily available ocean-atmosphere variables, and those which available from standard forecasts, to a potentially non-linear prediction of monthly stream flowsis crucial to the optimal operation of the reservoir. The MARS (Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines) model is calibrated to provide forecasts of monthly stream flows over the period 1956-1986.The applicability of the forecast technique is discussed by reference to comparisons between observed and forecasted flows in a separate model validation series (1987-1992).Reliability of the stream flowforecasting methodology is investigated over \u0093forecast horizons\u0094 ranging from 3 to 12 months, and the potential economic value of incorporating the methodology into the operation of the national power generating system is illustrated.\nSOIL MOISTURE AND WATER BALANCE IN FORESTED ECOSYSTEMS OF THE MONCAYO (IBERIAN RANGE, SPAIN)\nPaloma Ibarra, Juan Mart\u00ednez and Teresa Echeverr\u00eda\nDepartment of Geography and Territory Planning, Faculty of Philosophy and Arts, University of Zaragoza, 50.009- Zaragoza (Spain)\nWater behaviour in forest soils, an oak-wood (Quercus pyrenaica) and a pine-wood (Pinus sylvestris) located on the northern side of the Moncayo Massif (Sistema Ib\u00c8rico, Zaragoza, Spain) is analysed in this study. After a description of the area being studied, the northern side of the Moncayo, and specially of the test areas in the selected forests, an introduction of methodological character is carried out, in which the process to obtain different experimental data and the characterisation of soils are developed.\nThe results are expressed graphically, demonstrating the different behaviour of water in the soils of the two forests subject to study. Soil moisture values correspond to the different depths (duft, 0-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm) and at different times during the year, and is related to climatic parameters such as rainfall and temperature, linked phenologically to the presence of canopy and soil cover, pointing out the texture and quantity of organic matter in each of the defined depths.\nA clear seasonal behaviour of soil moisture in relation with climatic and phenological reasons is observed in both forests; however, the differences in soil moisture, always in favour of the pine-wood in the superior subhorizons (duft, 0-5 and 5-10 cm), are nullified in the inferior depth (10-15 cm), in which the soil moisture of oak-wood is generally higher, in relation with the soil texture and the morphology on which the soils of both forests are developed.\nTHE INFLUENCE OF LAKE HULA DRAINAGE IN THE WATER AND SEDIMENT REGIME OF JORDAN RIVER AND LAKE KINNERET\nMoshe Inbar\nDepartment of Geography, University of Haifa, Israel\nIn the last century, human activities have altered rivers and swamps by drainage, water abstraction, regulation and many other activities.\nIn Israel 95% of natural streams and rivers had been regulated to a large extent. The major project was the drainage of the Hula lake and swamps in the 1950s. The Hula basin is an elongated U shaped tectonic valley covering an area of 110 km2 in the northern part of Israel. Its general outline is determined by tectonic features of the Dead Sea transform. The Jordan river drains the Hula valley and then trough a narrow basaltic canyon flows into Lake Kinneret. The annual rainfall ranges from 400 mm in the south to 650 mm in the north.\nAfter the drainage, the annual mean maximum peak discharges have increased from 57 m3/s to 90 m3/s. The Flood Routing Index has been doubled and floods are transmitted in a much shorter time. Most of the river\u00eds annual suspended sediment transport were deposited before the drainage into lake Hula, which acted as a silting depositional intermediate dam, but after the drainage there is a direct and rapid transmission of sediment directly to the lake. A new delta at the Jordan river outlet was formed in 1969, increasing the length of the river channel by about 1000 m.\nMan-made control of the river has created a delicate new equilibrium in the Jordan river-lake Kinneret system, the major change being expressed in a more rapid transmission of water and sediments by the new system and a completely new morphological transfer system.\nDAMMED LAKE: A NEED TO RETURN LIMNOSYSTEM TO THE NATURAL STATE\nKestutis Kilkus\nVilnius University, Lithuania\nLithuania is rich in waters if all surface water resources are considered (about 7000 m?/capita per year), but problems sometimes are caused by uneven distribution of precipitation and runoff in space and time, especially, in case of always-possible several year-long sequences of dry years. That is why about 1000 reservoirs with total area of 268 km? were constructed in Lithuania since 1970. The reservoirs are/ or were used for power generation, fishery, irrigation, sanitation and other purposes. Because it was much cheaper to get the same storage capacity damming the outlet of natural lake as the river valley, the first option was very popular in the engineering too.\nSubject: Lake Zuvintas. Shallow (mean depth is 1.2 m) eutrophicated lake located in the middle reaches of the Dovine River (the tributaryof the Susupe River). Catchment area and water surface area are 345 and 9.3 km?, accordingly. The ratio of the amount of precipitation on the surface of the lake to the total amount of inflow is 1:10 and the renewal rate of the water stored in the lake is about 5 times per year. It is nature reserve since 1938; a large number of rare and endangered species are under protection.\nEnvironmental aims of the damming: (1) to increase the efficiency of water supply system based on the storage capacities (14 x 106 m?) of dammed lakes (Lake Dusia and Lake Simnas) locating upstream the Lake Zuvintas and, consequently, to increase the low runoff of heavy polluted Sesupe River near the Marijampole town; (2) to minimize the Lake Zuvintas level fluctuations during the nesting period of waterfowl, i.e. in spring.\nEcological consequences. Short-term fluctuations in the Lake Zuvintas level (seasonal amplitude) decreased from 0.83 to 0.44 m, in average, and the maximum discharge of the outlet also decreased, accordingly. Flood reduction caused that more detritus was deposited in the lake and the mats of reeds compacted. The diversity of biotops as well as waterfowl species decreased. Further, the effect of accumulation of the weak fulvic-humic acids derived from the plants and peats was evident; the acidification of water inside the reed mats went on especially fast. The yield of submerged macrophytes, e.g. Chara, decreased, and the same was reaction of population of swans due to the food shortage. The accumulation of organics contributed to the severe reduction in oxygen and fish mortality in winterkill conditions increased in frequency.\nSince environmental protection aim has a priority in Lake Zuvintas management, the decision to reconstruct the natural hydrological regime of the unique \u00ecLake of Swans\u00ee as well as two lakes located upstream has been made, and the second option would be doing nothing with lake water resources. The estimated costs of reconstruction of \u00eccheap\u00ee reservoirs are about 150 000 USD. Is it cheap, really?\nRIVER CHANNEL OVERGROWTH DYNAMICS\nKestutis Kilkus\nVilnius University, Lithuania\nDifferent approaches to the estimation of the overgrowth of river channel by aquatic vegetation are possible. Hydrologists are very interested in this greatly because macrophytes have an effect upon hydraulic conductivity of river channel as well as processes of river-bed deformation. The overgrowth of channel should also be taken into account in some runoff calculation procedures.\nThe impact of macrophytes on water quality could be described by simplified chain of factors/ or processes: biogenic backwater ( water current velocity ( water ventilation ( nitrification / denitrification ratio ( accumulation of nutrients in the biomass of macrophytes. Almost all links of the chain are closely connected with the runoff so we can expect for the fluctuations in hydro-ecological conditions might be pre-determined by runoff fluctuations.\nThe main approach to the study of the river channel overgrowth is, of course, biometric one, but opportunities to use such approach are limited because of high costs and insufficiency of information. Hydrometric approach we used in our research is indirect one but it is valuable enough as necessary systematic data are collected already, so the researcher has a good start for his work at the beginning. In this case, the effect of channel\u00eds overgrowth should be estimated as biogenic backwater (H), i.e. the deviation of discharge measured in summer from the stage-discharge graph corresponding to the free channel conditions.\nMore objective information about long-term fluctuations of (H should be gained from the relationship between the elements (water stage-discharge) oflake-outlet hydraulic system. Such modification of the stage-discharge graph was applied for 8 Lithuanian streams flowing from lakes and having systematic hydrometrical data as well as episodically made measurements.\nThe calculated (H values show that distinct seasonal cycle in the overgrowing of outlet channel exists. In all investigated lake-river systems biogenic backwater is especially significant at the end of summer and/ or in the early autumn and later on it gradually decreases. On the other hand, the backwater at the beginning of winter is more significant than at the start of summer, because the remains of macrophytes in channels are washed away by spring flood. The thickness of dammed water layer in lakes amounts on average from 5 to 27 cm in June-October and it takes up to 70-80% of storage capacity of the lake. Consequently, the minimum discharge of the out-flowing river is reduced in summer. Long-term fluctuations of (H have been observed too, and it seems that they should be pre-determined by synergetic impact of fluctuations of heat, nutrients and, especially, runoff.\nEFFECTS OF IRRIGATION ON WATER SALINIZATION IN SEMI-ARID ENVIRONMENTS: A CASE STUDY IN THE CENTRAL EBRO DEPRESSION, SPAIN\nT.

In this paper the temporal and spatial variability of the sedfiment exported from an irrigated area is studied. The area selected is located in the middle Ebro Depression, where irrigated areas rest upon gypsipherous soils. In the study area, 67 % of the territory is cultivated qith rice, lucerne, sunflower and corn, and the rest corresponds to bare badlands.\nEvery 15 days during 16 months the inflow and outflow discharge was measured in a small irrigated catchment (650 ha) and water samples were taken for laboratory analysis purposes. Furthermore, other 12 points within the study area were controlled in order to estimate the supply of materials according to land uses.\nThe results obtained show an increase of sediment concentration at the outlet of the catchment, with high values of solute outputs as sulfates, sodium, chlorides, calcium and carbonates. During the irrigation season, salt concentration is slightly lower than during the non-irrigated season, though total sediment losses are much higher due to higher discharges.\nRESEARCH ON ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL WATER REQUIREMENT OF RIVER SYSTEMS IN HAIHE-LUANHE BASINS\nLi Lijuan & Zheng Hongxing\nInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China\nIn the history of water utilization and development, our attention was mainly paid on the benefit we can get from rivers while the environmental and ecological function of the river system used to be neglected. Thus the activities of water utilization and development were accompanied by more and more serious environmental and ecological problems. In order to reduce the environmental and ecological problems induced by water resources development and utilization, this paper has proposed a concept of environmental and ecological water requirement. It is defined as the minimum water amount to be required or consumed by the natural water body to conserve its environmental and ecological functions. Based on the definition, the methods on calculating the amount of environmental and ecological water requirement are determined. In the case study on Haihe-luanhe river system, the water requirement is divided into three parts, i.e. the basic water requirement of rivers, water requirement for sediment transfer and water consumption by evaporation of the lakes. The methods of calculating the different parts of water requirement were shown in expressions. In a case study on Hai-Luanhe Basins, the hydrological records before 1960, which may represent the natural condition of the river systems, were used for calculating. The results of the calculation have shown that the environmental and ecological water requirement in the Basins is about 124 (108m3, including 57 (108m3 for basic in-stream flow, 63 (108m3 for sediment transfer and 4 (108m3 for net evaporation loss of lakes. Thus it was estimated that the total amount of environmental and ecological water requirement accounts 54% of the amount of runoff (228(108m3). However, there are still some aspects of environmental and ecological requirement that are not under our consideration. It should be realized that the amount of environmental and ecological water requirement must be more than that we have calculated. According to the results, we considered that the rational utilization rate of the runoff in the Basins must be no more than 40%. Since the current utilization rate of the Basins, which is as high as 80%, has been far beyond the limitation, the problems of environment and ecology are quite serious. It is urgent to control and adjust water development and utilization to eliminate those problems existed and to avoid the potential ecological or environmental crisis.\nMODELLING THE EFFECT OF LAND USE CHANGE ON WATER RESOURCES.A CASE STUDY IN A MEDITERRANEAN MOUNTAINOUS CATCHMENT\nP. Llorens, I. Oliveras & J. Latron\nInstitute of Earth Sciences \"Jaume Almera\", CSIC, Sol\u00e9 i Sabar\u00eds, s/n 08028-Barcelona, Spain\nThe main environmental change occurring in the Mediterranean mountainous areas is afforestation of old agricultural lands. Land cover change have a direct influence on catchment water balance, as this has been largely demonstrated in experimental catchments around the world. The effect of land cover on water balance is due principallyto the differences in water losses to the atmosphere between different vegetation types.\nThis work analyses the effect of land use change on surface hydrology and water resources using the SIMBAL water balance model. This daily time step model is a simple tool, able to cope with the particular evapo-transpirative dynamics of different land covers. The model has been successfully validated both with discharge and using catchment soil water reserve in the small Can Vila research catchment in the pre-Pyrenees.\nThe SIMBAL model has been used to explore an extended set of plausible land use scenarios in the study area. Theland use scenarios correspond to multiple combinations of 3 land covers: pastures, pine and oak forest. Results show a reduction of runoff, when changing from a scenario where pastures are the dominant cover to another where trees are dominant. The scenario where pine forest is the dominant cover produce the highest flow reduction.\nEFFECTS OF THE YESA RESERVOIR ON HIGH FLOWS OF THE ARAG\u00d3N RIVER, CENTRAL SPANISH PYRENEES\nJ.I. L\u00f3pez-Moreno, S. Beguer\u00eda & J.M. Garc\u00eda-Ruiz\nInstituto Pirenaico de Ecolog\u00eda, CSIC, Campus de Aula Dei, Apartado 202, 50080-Zaragoza, Spain\nReservoirs represent strong changes in the river regimes downstream the dam. Particularly, floods are partially retained by the reservoirs, in order to increase the reservoir storage and reduce the impact of the peak flow. The Yesa reservoir drains an area of 2,181 km2 in the Upper Arag\u00f3n River Basin, and is mainly devoted to supply water to the new irrigated areas of Bardenas, in the Central Ebro Depression. It was constructed in 1959. Since 1914 there is a gaugins station at Yesa, immediately downstream the actual location of the dam. Thus, it is possible to compare the behaviour of the river before and after the construction of the reservoir.\nThe Yesa reservoir is mainly infilled during the high flows of autumn and spring, when most of the floods occur. The greatest volume stored is reached at the end of May, and then it is quickly reduced. The behaviour of the reservoir against any flood will depend on the season of the year and the intensity of the flood. A statistical analysis of the floods suggests that the Yesa reservoir clearly reduces the intensity of high and medium-frequency floods, but increases the peak flow of the low-frequency floods.\nIMPACT OF SALT LOADFROM NON-POINT SOURCES ON WATER QUALITY OF THE ARBA RIVER.\nJavier Mach\u00edn & Ana Navas\nEstaci\u00f3n Experimental de Aula Dei, CSIC, Apartado 202, 50080-Zaragoza, Spain\nDegradation of water quality ofsurface waters in the Ebro river basin constitutes an important environmental concern because of the increasing salinity trends observed in this region. A significant contribution to the salt load transported by the rivers is supplied by non-point sources from irrigation return flows.\nThe Bardenas I irrigated area occupies 28000 has inthe semiarid central part of the Ebro valley. Return flows from this area have been monitored during the last decade. Since 1990, a total of 16 sampling points on return irrigation canals and another 6 sites along the Arba river, the natural drainage system ofthis area, have been sampled on a weekly/fortnightlybasis.A high spatial variability in salinity levels has been found in the area, thus electrical conductivity varies from 0.3 to 10 dSm-1 depending on the irrigation period and on the soil types drained. The electrical conductivity in the Arba river increases from 0.3 to 4.7 dSm-1 from the inlet to the outlet of the Bardenas area.Therefore, the salt load supplied from the irrigation return flows amounts more than 50% of the total load transported by the Arba river. This river presents the highest salinity levels in the Ebro basin. Poor water quality due to the high salinity determines restricted use for several purposes, that according to Ayers & Wescott (1976) is classified between moderate and severe.In order to reduce this environmental impact, it is necessary to establish good management practices involving design of more water efficient uses to avoid further water quality deterioration.\nRAINFALL INTERCEPTION IN OPEN EVERGREEN WOODLAND IN SOUTHWEST SPAIN\nBego\u00f1a Mateos & Susana Schnabel\nDpto. de Geograf\u00eda, Universidad de Extremadura, C\u00e1ceres, Spain,\nRainfall interception by holm oaks (Quercus rotundifolia) was studied in the dehesas, a landuse system widespread in the southwestern part of the Iberian Peninsula, which consists of pastureland with openly spaced tree cover. Measurements of throughflow and stemflow were carried out in the Guadalperal\u00f3n study catchment, located in Extremadura, and data of three hydrological years (1995-1998) are available on an event basis. The effect of tree pruning on interception was also investigated. In dehesas holm oaks are usually pruned in intervals of approximately 10 years in order to obtain firewood and to increase acorn production. Four trees were selected for monitoring, two non-pruned and two pruned individuals. Meteorological data (rainfall, temperature, solar radiation, air humidity and wind velocity) was registered in intervals of 5 minutes. Throughfall was measured with a total number of 163 raingauges distributed in a regular grid below the tree canopies, allowing an analysis of its spatial distribution.\nOn average 26.7% of the annual rainfall is intercepted. The pruned trees intercept clearly less rainfall than the unpruned ones, with 23.6% and 29.9%, respectively. Stemflow is of little importance, representing less than 1% of the annual precipitation. The spatial variation of throughfall is high and is mainly related with morphological characteristics of the tree canopy, though the effect of wind could also be demonstrated. On an event basis, throughfall is mainly controlled by the amount of precipitation and to a minor degree by rainfall intensity, temperature and air humidity. Although individual holm oaks intercept a considerable amount of rainfall, the importance on the water balance of the catchment is small due to the low tree density. With a canopy cover of 8%, the water loss due to interception constitutes only 4% of the annual precipitation.\nODRAFLOOD: A FLOOD FORECASTING SYSTEM FOR THE ODRA DRAINAGE BASIN\nH.-T. Mengelkamp (1), M. Klein (1), H. Messal (1), E. Raschke (1) & J. Backhaus (2)\n(1) GKSS Research Center Geesthacht, Institut for Atmospheric Physics\nMax-Planck-Str. 1, D-21502 Geesthacht\n(2) German Aerospace Center DLR, D-51147 Cologne\nIn July 1997 two episodes of heavy rainfall in the upper catchment of the Odra river caused severe flooding in the Czech Republic, Poland and some areas in Germany. Hundreds of cities and villages were inundated, more than 100 casualties occured and vast areas of land were flooded for weeks. The disaster management demanded the development of an integrated flood forecasting system.\nODRAFLOOD is a combination of model components covering a wide range of spatial scales including a rainfall-runoff model for the whole Odra catchment, simulation models forfloodplain inundation and embankment breaches as well as reservoir management and the flooding of urban areas. In its present state ODRAFLOOD is driven by observed or forecasted precipitation data. At a later stage the model chain is planned to be nested in a weather forecast system. This was already succesfully performed for the upper Odra catchment where the flood originated.\nThe model components were tested separately. Examples will be shown for the grid-pint based rainfall-runoff model covering the whole Odra catchment, for a 2-dimensional model for embankment breaches, based on the Navier-Stokes-equations, and a high-resolution dynamical-statistical model to simulate the inundation of urban areas.\nRUNOFF SIMULATION IN THE UPPER ODRA CATCHMENT DURING THE FLOODING EVENT 1997 WITH A COUPLED ATMOSPHERIC/HYDROLOGICAL MODEL\nH.-T. Mengelkamp, J. Sutm\u00fcller, T. Zhao\nGKSS Research Center Geesthacht, Institut for Atmospheric Physics, Max-Planck-Str. 1, D-21502 Geesthacht\nThe generation of surface runoff, subsurface runoff and baseflow is described in the atmospheric land-surface model SEWAB (Surface Energy and Water Balance) by scale dependend concepts which require tuning of appropriate parameters using observed rainfall and streamflow. Alternatively, the concept of the topographic index is implemented. Here, digital high resolution terrain data are used to estimate the subgrid scale runoff generation. The only tuning parameter is the vertical profile of the saturation hydraulic conductivity.\nBoth concepts are used to simulate discharge from the upper Odra catchment from April to August 1997. SEWAB is forced with observations. The time series of both simulations differ only slightly and agree well with the observed data.\nSEWAB is implemented in the non-hydrostatic atmospheric mesoscale model GESIMA (Geesthacht Simulation Model of the Atmosphere) which is coupled to a horizontal routing scheme. Nudged into the Deutschlandmodell of the German Weather Service the model chain is used to simulate discharge from the upper Odra catchment during the flooding event in 1997, which was the largest flood desaster in this region for decades. We will discuss simulated and observed streamflow data.\nA DIGITAL WATER BUDGET AND HYDROLOGIC ATLAS FOR COLOMBIA\nO. Mesa, G. Poveda, J. I. V\u00e9lez, O. J. Barco, L. A. Cuartas, R. Mantilla, C. D. Hoyos, J. F. Mej\u00eda, B. A. Botero & M. I. Montoya\nPostgrado en Recursos Hidr\u00e1ulicos, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, A. 1027 Medell\u00edn, Colombia\nWe have developed a 5-arcmin digital atlas of monthly and long-term average rainfall, evapotranspiration and runoff for Colombia, including maps of input variables such as temperature, humidity, radiation, etc. The maps capture the spatial variability of the geophysical fields resulting from major geographic, topographic and climatic controls. The spatial scale of such maps has been defined as a function of the quantity and distribution of the observations and of the dependence structure of the field itself. Colombia has a great variety of hydro-climatic regions, due to its tropical location, the influence of the Andes mountains ranges and sea-land interactions. Construction of the rainfall map was based on the available rain gages observations, satellite estimates, re-analysis global maps and previous studies. For interpolation purposes we used Kriging with drift. Evaporation was estimated using diverse methods. Runoff was estimated using the long-term water budget equation. The existing streamflow records at a wide range of basin sizes where then used for checking and evaluation of the methods, obtaining an average mean square error of 15%.Maps are digital, interactive and part of a more comprehensive and complex information systems (GIS) and data base to access and consult many hydrometeorological variables throughout Colombia. Estimation of diverse hydrological and climatological fields can be largely improved by including trans-boundary data, in particular for the tropical Americas. Undergoing work includes maps of extreme values and hydrological anomalies associated with El Ni\u00d2o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and sediment yield. Water resource management and planning and multiple applications in hydropower, agriculture, human health, sustainable development, ecology and other environmental and socio-economic tasks benefit from the maps.\nESTIMATING LOW FLOW FREQUENCIES IN THE MID TO LATE 21ST CENTURY USING AN AIRFLOW INDEX-BASED STOCHASTIC WEATHER GENERATOR AND A PHYSICALLY-BASED HYDROLOGICAL SIMULATION MODEL\nN.C. Mountain and J.A.A. Jones\nInstitute of Geography and Earth Sciences, University of Wales, Aberystwyth, UK\nThe research reported here uses a methodology that has been developed to generate riverflow scenarios for future climate change from GCMs. The method involves simulation of daily flows to assess the degree of change in flow frequencies, lengths of low flow periods and seasonal distributions in catchments in mid-Wales under two climate change scenarios derived from the Hadley Centre HadCM2 GCM. The method consists of: (1) establishing statistical relationships between interval-scale airflow indices (vorticity, the strength of the geostrophic wind, and its zonal and meridional directional components) and recorded precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) for the period of instrumental record within each catchment, (2) using the derived transitional probabilities and correlations as input to a daily Stochastic Weather Generator, and (3) inputting this synthesised daily weather sequence into a physically-based hydrological simulation model (HYSIM). Split-sample tests indicate good agreement between predicted and recorded daily flow frequencies, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency criterion of 0.7 for daily flows and 0.9 for monthly totals. The results suggest that there will be increased frequency of low flow days during the summer and a slight increase in the length of individual low flow spells.\nBEHAVIOUR OF SEVERAL CATCHMENTS WITH DIFFERENT LAND COVER: EFFECTS OF ABANDONMENT OF AGRICULTURAL FIELDS.\nJordi Nadal (1) & Joan Salda\u00f1a (2)\n(1) Geography Department, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra (Spain)\n(2) IMA, Universitat de Girona, 17071 Girona (Spain)\nThe research project \u00ecManagement and analysis of land uses, landscape and sustainable development in natural protected areas\u00ee studies the evolution of landscapes after farm abandonment. One way to understand this evolution is studying the information that we can obtained from the water cycle.\nThe first hypotesis of this work is that the vegetable cover of catchments has a decisive role in the hydrological behaviour. This behaviour can be evaluated through the study of hydrographs or through water analysis. We have worked in seven catchments with different land uses: Bare rokc, Natural forest, Transition forest, Scrubland, Abandoned agricultural fields and Active agricultural fields.\nThese catchments are located in the National Park of Sant Lloren\u00e7 in the Catalan Prelitoral Range (41?40\u00edN, 2?W), with a Mediterranean climate modified by altitude (from 300m to 1100m).\nMethodology used has been the description of study areas, the calculation of land uses and water analysis of 10 diferent parameters after rain episodes. From the results obtained it is possible to deduce the followings:\nBehaviour of catchments follows two different paths: natural covers and humanized covers. Scrubland offers a soil protection similar to that of forest. Abandoned lands have a similar behaviour than as active lands. This for a long period of time (more than fifty years).\nA DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (TALSIM) FOR THE REASSESSMENT OF RESERVOIR SYSTEMS OPERATION RULES AS PART OF INTEGRATED RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT\nManfred Ostrowski (1) & Hubert Lohr (2)\n(1) Darmstadt University of Technology, Engineering Hydrology and Water Resources Management. (2) Mll-WIS Consulting Engineers, Darmstadt, Germany\nFrom early civilisation reservoirs have been considered the most efficient technical measures to balance the unequal temporal and spatial distribution of runoff. For the largest part design and operation were looked at and evaluated merely from an economical point of view.\nHowever, besides manifold benefits, such as flood control, low flow augmentation, water supply for industry or irrigation, hydropower generation etc., reservoirs can also have negative effects e.g. in the area of environmental disturbances or safety of downstream dwellers. Also, many existing reservoirs are still operated under the assumptions initially made during their design phase.\nIn 1994 the Federal State of North-Rhine-Westphalia, Germany took the initiative to develop a generic simulation and optimisation modelling system as part of a decision support tool to enable interested reservoir owners and operators to reassess their operation rules under changing objectives and boundary conditions such as system extension.\nThe discussion on benefits and costs, both tangible and intangible is less of technical than of political nature. However it seems compulsory to provide a sound objective technological base for this discussion to avoid misuse and misunderstanding of subjective arguments.\nDuring the last 15 years so called decision support systems are under development to serve this purpose. Despite obvious successes it is still difficult to combine objective information and modelling parts of DSS with the evaluation and decision making parts, respectively.\nThis model base of the decision support tool TALSIM has recently been completed. It has been applied to several small systems during the development and testing phase. At present the tool is applied to one of the most complicated systems in Germany, the Eifel-Rur reservoir system.\nThis paper will provide: I) A problem description; ii) An overview of DSS for reservoir operation ; iii)A discussion of strengths and limitations of such systems; iv) A demonstration of some case studies.\nTHE IMPACT OF LONG TERM LAND USE CHANGES ON THE OCCURENCE OF EXTREME FLOODS - THE MODAU CASE STUDY\nManfred Ostrowski (1), Steffen Heusch (1) & Marcus Lempert (2)\n(1) Darmstadt University of Technology, Engineering Hydrology and Water Resources Management\n(2) Kisters Consulting Engineers, Aachen, Germany\nThe Modau River is a small direct tributary of River Rhine with a catchment area of about 200 km2, located in the Federal State of Hesse, Germany. During the last centuries the river has been heavily modified by industrial and other anthropogenic impacts, like agricultural use and ongoing urbanisation. It can be expected that besides water quality deterioration the flood regime of the river has significantly changed. This is the hypothesis of a model based study of the Modau river basin being part of the European 4th Framework Project FRAMEWORK.\nBased on multi-temporal air photographs starting from 1935 important changes of land use were digitised at 10 year intervals and stored in a GIS. In addition important changes of hydraulic characteristics such as river training and flood retention facilities were also detected and documented.\nA physically oriented deterministic model (WBMTUD) was applied to the Modau River basin to describe and analyse its flood regime for changing historical and synthetic land use scenarios. Based on simultaneous rainfall and runoff observations optimum model parameters were estimated, both for continuous long term and single event short term mode. Statistical analysis and deterministic modelling were used to test the hypothesis. However, results could not confirm the hypothesis, rather a variety of less expected results will be presented.\nBEFORE AND AFTER-WILDFIRE SOIL AND WATER QUALITY ASSESSMENT IN A SEMI-ABANDONED RURAL AREA OF NE SPAIN\nGiovanni Pardini, Maria Gispert, Gemma Dunjo, & Luis Laporta\nSoil Science Unit, University of Girona, 17003 Girona, Spain\nRural abandonment of hillside soils may have beneficial or detrimental effects on soil properties and water availability depending on post-abandonment land management and soil resilience. When agro-forestry practices fail, early-diffused dense shrub-dominated ecosystems are affected by wildfire recurrence, which may severely affect the composition of vegetation, and both soil and water quality. Likewise, damaging effects on soil properties may be expected when partial abandonment occurs and soil is continuously exploited without any amendment. Increase in structure deterioration and crusting may produce higher overland flow, resulting in accelerated erosion and nutrient depletion and the concentration of soluble compounds in runoff water may increase as well. The Serra de Rodes cathment (Girona Province, NE Spain) is a typical Mediterranean environment where Lithic Xerorthents are predominant and soil properties vary with the varying canopy covers. In this area, the rural abandonment took place at the beginning of the last century and landscape has been modelled according to the periodical passage of fire. The objective of this research was to determine soil and water quality indicators during a period of six months before and six months after the wildfire occurred the 7th august 2000, in a sequence of partially abandoned fields, abandoned fields at different age of abandonment, and a pine forested area. Accordingly, partially abandoned fields, (PAF), recently (5 years) abandoned fields (RA5), fields at middle (25 years) abandonment (MA25), late (50 years) abandoned fields (LA50) and a fifty years old pine forested area (PA50) were sampled at 0-10 cm depth at random after any rainfall event during the period of observation. Samples were analysed for Texture, Moisture content (M) and Water Holding Capacity (WHC), Bulk Density (BD), Mechanic Impedance (MI), pH, Soil Organic Matter (SOM), Total nitrogen (TN), Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K). After any rainfall event sediments and runoff water were collected from erosion tanks and analysed for organic carbon and nitrogen (the eroded soil) and for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and soluble (Ca, Mg, Na, and K) cations, (the runoff water). Results show that before the wildfire the age of abandonment enhances water holding capacity and nutrient reserve due to the accumulation of organic litter and the enrichment of humus compounds in organic horizon, although nutrient depletion by runoff water was also higher in more vegetated soils. The highest sediment yield was found in the partially abandoned fields (PAF) whilst the recent abandonment (RA5) was comparatively the less eroded environment due to the presence of grass at the soil surface. Moreover, the best structure of this environment and the reduced surface litter (rye-grass provides iso-humic enrichment in the organic horizon) also lowered the removal of dissolved nutrients like DOC and DON. After the wildfire a steep increase in runoff and sediment yield was observed and the content of organic carbon and nitrogen either in the eroded soil or in the runoff water increased to a large extent. Also, a drastic modification of selected soil properties was recorded during the period of observations after the fire.\nANALYSIS OF THE SEVERE FLOOD (13-16 OCTOBER 2000) IN PIEDMONT (ITALY)\nR.

Qian (2)\n(1) Regional Meteorological Service of Piedmont, Turin, Italy\n(2) Department of General Physics, University, Turin, Italy\nThe disastrous flood occurred in the whole Piedmont (in North-Western Italy) during 13th-16th of October 2000 was associated with heavy rainfall over the North-Western Alpine chain in successive episodes spanning the whole period. The most intense rainfall (where values larger than 600 mm have been reported) occurred over the mountainous region. The event started when Southern strong and moist flows established over the North-Western Italy. The atmosphere was strongly barocline during day 13th, and caused a strong convergence in the lower layers on the western Po Valley. At the same time, the high temperature of the Mediterranean Sea caused an high rate of moisture enrichment of the air mass moving towards Piedmont. The precipitations intensified starting from day 13th over the Northern sector of Piedmont. During day 14th, the baric situation changed slowly causing an eastern rotation of the air flow; the areas affected by the strongest precipitations were the Western basins. During this day, apparently convection played an important role, and the high temperatures forced the snow-rain threshold at very high levels. During day 15th, the arrival of a cold front from West produced a destabilization of the atmosphere, causing some thunderstorm activity. The maxima rainfalls were observed in the North-Western areas, but high rainfall rates were observed also in the flat areas. Finally, during the last day of the event (16th), an intensification of the Southern flows caused again strong precipitations in the Northern mountain areas?.\nThis event was one of the more intense events of the last 200 years in the Piedmont area. The majority of the basins suffered strong flood episodes; most of the mountainous portion of the basins and also part of the city of Turin were seriously damaged by the strong rainfall. During the presentation, we will describe the meteorological conditions that caused the event and the main hydrological consequences on the Piedmont basins.\nANALYSIS OF A SEVERE FLOOD (13-16 OCTOBER 2000) IN PIEDMONT (ITALY) USING THE COUPLED MODEL RAMS-LSPM\nM.W.

Paesano (2)\n(1) Department of General Physics, University, Turin, Italy\n(2) Regional Meteorological Service of Piedmont, Turin, Italy\nWe simulated the flood event described in the previous presentation by using the mesoscale model RAMS (Regional Atmospheric Modeling System), driven by the ECMWF analyses and coupled with the surface scheme LSPM (Land Surface Process Model), in order to evaluate the hydrologic budget during the flood. We focused our attention on the entire Piedmont area. During the simulation, we were particularly interested in observing the components of the hydrologic budget (runoff, drainage and the variation of the soil moisture content) and the contribution of the evaporation and of the latent heat flux during the flood episode. As the RAMS/LSPM is a regional model, it is also possible to check some parameters at a regional scale and over a tridimensional grid. During this presentation, we want to show the more interesting characteristics emerging from this study.\nENERGY AND WATER BALANCE AT SOIL-AIR INTERFACE IN A SAHELIAN REGION\nM.W. Qian (2,4), N.

In fact, in very dry conditions, the water vapour flux plays an important role in the evaporation processes and influences the underground profiles of humidity and temperature. The improved version of soil moisture parameterisation in the LSPM scheme has been checked by using the data taken from the database of the field experiment HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrology-Atmosphere Pilot EXperiment in the Sahel, 1990-1992). Model simulations refer to three different stations located in Niger (Fallow, Millet and Tiger sites) where input data for LSPM and observations were simultaneously available. The results of simulations, taking into account the water vapour flux in the soil model LSPM, seem to compare better with the observed behaviour of soil moisture and turbulent heat fluxes than those overlooking the water vapour flux, confirming the great importance of the water vapour in such dry conditions.\nCOMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE VARIATION OF HEAVY METAL CONCENTRATIONS IN THE DOURO, TAGUS AND SADO RIVERS' FLOOD SEDIMENTS (PORTUGAL)\nE.

The Lower Tagus runs, after leaving the high quartzitic crests of Portas do Rod\u0084o, in an extensive floodplain about 6 km wide, in cenozoic sediments, the Douro is strongly encased in high granitic banks and the Sado is an intermediate situation, runing in a not very large alluvial plain, in paleozoic and cenozoic formations. Due to these different situations, their behaviour in hydrological terms is also different.\nThe samples for the heavy metal evaluation were taken using manual drilling but in distinct positions relatively to the present channel: for the Tagus, two drillings were done, one right in the channel (3.7 m deep) and the other approximately 3.0 km away from it (7.4 m deep); for the Douro, the samples were taken in a good outcrop, in a meander at an altitude of 123 m and reaching a depth of 10 m; for the Sado, a manual coring in the present channel was complemented by sampling in 3 m high banks, to a total thickness of 8 m.\nFor all the samples, sedimentological, geochemical and radiochronological analyses were carried out, being detected very important variations in the heavy metal concentrations and in the percentage < 4\u00b5m fraction, related with the geological and geomorphological characteristics of the correspondent basins.\nThe results presented also show the different hydrodynamics of the three rivers as well as the human influence over the last 5000 years BP, namely concerning the mining activities.\nHOLOCENE EVOLUTION OF THE LOWER TAGUS RIVER ALLUVIAL PLAIN (PORTUGAL)\nC.

The purpose of this project is to improve the knowledge of the behaviour of the studied rivers far back to times where there was no reading registration, trying to improve in this manner the estimates for large return periods, like high magnitude floods, as well as to fill an important gap in the Portuguese research in what concerns Earth Sciences.\nTo undergo this study two sampling sites (Quinta da Boavista and Fonte Bela) in an approximately 6 km width alluvial plain, both on the right margin of the Tagus River and distancing about 16 km from one another, were chosen due to their geographical position and different morphological characteristics.\nQuinta da Boavista, north of Santar\u00c8m, is located on the Tagus\u00ed fluvial channel, at an altitude of about 9 m. The sediments studied were collected by manual coring and reached a depth of 3.70 m below the water level. The sampling at Fonte Bela, south of Santar\u00c8m, was carried out on the alluvial plain, roughly 3 km away from the present fluvial channel. This sampling reached a total depth of 7.40 m in a drainage trench, of which 2.50 m were sampled subaerially and the remaining in depth.\nAll the samples, from both sites, underwent sedimentological, geochemical and radiochronological analyses.\nThe results achieved show accentuated variations in the clay and heavy metal contents, which are in part imputed to lateral migrations of the fluvial channel and to anthropic contaminations from the present to times before the foundation of the Portuguese nationality. Besides these results, the radiochronological datings have allowed determine sedimentation rates for this region.\nThese studies are being developed in the ambit of the PRAXIS/C/CTE/14271/1998 Project financed by the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT).\nRUNOFF GENERATION ON ABANDONED FIELDS IN THE CENTRAL EBRO BASIN - RESULTS FROM EXPERIMENTS\nJ.B. Ries & M. Langer\nInstitut f\u00fcr Physische Geographie, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4t Frankfurt am Main, Senckenberganlage 36, D-60325 Frankfurt a. M., Germany.\nIn the semi-arid Central Ebro Basin experimental rainfall simulations with a small mobile jet rainfall simulator according to Calvo et al. (1988), Lasanta et al. (1994), Lasanta et al. (2000) were carried out on abandoned fields near Mar\u00eda de Huerva to investigate the conditions of runoff generation and local erodibility on abandoned fields. On the silty soils, susceptible to soil sealing and crusting, very divergent rates of runoff and erosion caused by water are found. On the crusted 5-year old fallow land runoff coefficients range between 20 and 95%, erosion rates range between 9 and 70 gm-2 in the experiments. The means are 63% and 27 gm-2. Soil surface sealing leads to a decrease of infiltration rates and a consequent increase of runoff compared with freshly tilled agricultural fields. On the 65-year old fallow land, values range from 0 to 76% and 0 to 78 gm-2 depending on other parameters such as slope and the activity of the edaphon, the means are 28% and 16 gm-2. A remarkable fact is that material delivery does not significantly decrease with increasing vegetation cover. Only with a vegetation cover of over 60% there is an evident decrease of material output.\nThe runoff rates show the same order of magnitude in comparison with the recorded rates, which Lasanta et al. (2000) presented recently for abandoned fields near Pe\u00f1aflor, but the erosion rates in Mar\u00eda de Huerva are significantly lower.\nCALVO, A., GISBERT, J. M., PALAU, E. & ROMERO, M.

Robinson\nDepartment of Geography, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA\nNorth Carolina has few inflowing rivers, so that the amount of fresh water naturally available to the state is largely constrained by the balance between the atmospheric processes of precipitation and evaporation. Drought provides a lower bound for water availability, and changes in the extent, intensity and duration of drought largely control the input side of water sustainability studies. However, statewide trends in drought have not been adequately addressed.\nIn the context of water sustainability, it is not clear what drought metric is appropriate. This preliminary investigation uses the records of the Palmer Hydrologic Drought Index, P, as the pertinent variable.This allows the development of a simple measure\nSI = SPi,i = 1?8(representing the 8 climate divisions in the state).\nThis can be calculated for all months from 1900 onwards, both unweighted and withweighting by area and by population. Linear regression techniques, and a threshold crossing time-series model are used to suggest possible trends. However, no unambiguous trend appears at the moment.\nIt is not clear that PHDI, which incorporates a specific, largely undefined, response timescale, is the correct variable to use. Studies of agricultural drought in North Carolina suggest that the Standardized Precipitation Index is better for that shorter term phenomenon, and may, with a suitably chosen time-scale, be appropriate here. Further, a simple mass balance approach, using areally integrated precipitation and evaporation directly, must be tested.\nINCREASED FLOODING INDUCED BY TOURISTIC URBAN LAND USES\nMaria Sala\nGrupo de Investigaci\u00f3n Ambiental Mediterr\u00e1nea, Universidad de Barcelona, Spain.\nThe occurrence of high intensity storm rainfall in the western Mediterranean results in severe and often catastrophic flooding.In the Catalan coastal catchments alone, located at the northeast of the Iberian peninsula, 296 zones have been estimated to be at risk from flooding (Berga, 1987). The change in catchment response to rainfall induced by urbanization is one of the most dramatic of man's impact on the hydrological cycle (Packman, 1979; Sala & Inbar, 1992). The basic effect of the increment of urban impervious areas on the rainfall-runoff processes is to increase storm runoff, thus increasing flood potential. Major trends of land use changes in the Mediterranean coastal streams show a marked progressive increment of the urbanized areas, basically related to touristic development of the coast. This study presents the characteristics of intense storm rainfall and flash flooding, which occur in the Ridaura catchment, located at the northeast Spanish coast. The maximum daily rainfall values associated with significant runoff events is in the order of 200 mm over a 24 hours period and a recurrence interval of 7 to 10 years. The discharges resulting from the rainfall events are approximately 200 m3/sec to 250 m3/sec and produce flooding in the downstream summer resort of Platja d'Aro.\nTHE WATER BALANCE OF DIFFERENT SOILS ON ABANDONED FIELDS ALONG A TRANSECT FROM THE CENTRAL EBRO BASIN TO THE PYRENEES\nT. Sauer & J.B. Ries\nInstitut f\u00fcr Physische Geographie, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4t Frankfurt am Main, Senckenberganlage 36, D-60325 Frankfurt a. M., Germany,\nThe water storage capacity of five typical soils on abandoned fields in five test areas along a transect from the Central Ebro Basin to the High Pyrenees (Leptic Haplogypsid, Haplic Calcixerept, Lithic Xerortent, Oxyaquic Vertic Haplustalf, Humic Dystrocryept) are related to climatic factors as precipitation and evapotranspiration. The annual precipitation increases from 300 mm in the Central Ebro Depression to 1800 mm in the subalpine area, the potential evapotranspiration decreases from 1000 mm to 600 mm. Thus there is a remarkable gradient of the climatic water balance. However in the High Pyrenees, months with a negative climatic water balance are frequent. For a period of 6 years the potential soil water balance was calculated on the base of soil physics and climatic data on a daily time step and compared with field data. The results show a very low content of plant available water within 5 months in the basin up to 2 weeks in the mountainous region, due to the long dry periods and the high content of fine pores because of high clay content of the soils. The limitation of plant available water is the main reason for a slow vegetation succession on abandoned fields. Due to the low vegetation cover runoff generation and soil erosion increase and the water deficit becomes higher.\nEL NI\u00d1O DRIVEN CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND DRAINAGE ANOMALIES IN PATAGONIAN REGION, ARGENTINA\nOlga E.

Important characteristics are large demand relative to supply, extensive development in floodplains, vulnerable groundwater supplies, water-quality problems, dependence on rain fed agriculture, and extensive dependence on hydroelectricity.\nRegions where water is already short during part or all of the year are vulnerable to the disruption of supply caused by such climatic variability as prolonged or intense droughts.\nThis paper proposes a methodology for forecasting extreme discharges of some rivers located at patagonian basins. The period with the biggest drainage was selected and the accumulated anomalies of the river discharges were used as hydrological variable.\nThe predictor considered was the sea surface temperature (SST) in the Pacific Ocean as a function of El Ni\u00f1o 3 (90?W-180?W; 5?N-5?S) on the Tropical Pacific Ocean and the results were evaluated with a simple linear regression model.\nUNCERTAINITY IN THE HYDROLOGICAL RESPONSE OF FORESTED AND UNFORESTED CATCHMENTS\nM.

Due to the actual lack of knowledge for understanding the runoff generation processes after the summer droughts, it was expected to gain additional information by investigating the runoff peaks in relation to the rainfall events. For this, the hydrographs of two catchments in the Central Pyrenees (Arn\u00e1s, Borau Valley, unforested, and San Salvador, A\u00edsa Valley, forested) have been studied in detail and compared with the structure of the rainfall causing the runoff. Previous investigations showed that, on the one hand, the response of the deforested catchment was very fast to precipitations of any volume and intensity in the cold (and humid) season. On the other hand, there was no significant relationship found between antecedent rainfall or rainfall intensity and the runoff in the warm (and dry) season.\nThe present study shows that even a dry catchment - evidenced by no or very low runoff before and after the stormflow event - can generate a high stormflow peak with a runoff coefficient exceeding 0.5. There was observed, too, that the stormflow hydrograph reflects the structure of the rainfall event, showing an increase and a decrease of the runoff with a lag of about 2 h to the variations of the rainfall intensity. Previous rainfall events, with similar intensities lead to no runoff. These first results indicate, first, that stormflows after the dry period is mainly caused by superficial runoff generation. Second, the runoff may be caused by exceeding a threshold rainfall intensity in function to the antecedent water surplus. The forested catchment shows very much lover variations of the runoff following rainfall. This can be explained by a higher water retention capacities of the soils under forest, the higher infiltration capacities and the attenuation of the rainfall intensity due to the vegetation cover.\nRUNOFF GENERATION ON ABANDONED FIELDS IN THE CENTRAL EBRO BASIN. RESULTS FROM MODELLING\nM. Seeger (1), J.B. Ries(2)\n(1) instituto Pirenaico de Ecolog\u00eda, CSIC, Campus de Aula Dei, Zaragoza, Spain.\n(2) Institut f\u00fcr Physische Geographie, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4t Frankfurt am Main, Senckenberganlage 36, D-60325 Frankfurt a. M., Germany,\nThe present paper is based on the results of rainfall simulations done by the project EPRODESERT an presented here by Ries & Neeb. Using the soil hydraulic characteristics measured in laboratory and the runoff data obtained by mobile plot rainfall simulator a physically based model \u00f1 HILLFLOW-1\u0086D \u00f1 was applied to understand and quantify the infiltration processes on abandoned fields of different ages in the Central Ebro Basin. The experimental data were used to calibrate the model. Further, different rainfall intensities and soil moisture conditions were modelled to understand runoff generation.\nThe results of the investigations indicate that especially the infiltration properties of the soil crust are determinant factors for runoff generation. It could be observed, too, that the hydraulic conductivity of the crust decreases with age within the first 5 years after abandonment. Different soil moistures, predominantly lower than pF 4.2, have low influence on the runoff generation by rainfall. In all cases, the increase of soil water content is limited to the soil crust. Modelling different rainfall intensities there can be stated, that with intensities of more than 20 mm h-1 the beginning of the runoff is within the first 10\u0086min of the rainfall, and the runoff-coefficients are higher than 0.4.\nThe modelling of rainfall simulations on more than 60 years old fallow land confirm the field observations: the infiltration characteristics, and consequently the runoff generation, depends on very low variations of the macroporosity of the soils. This has a very high variability in time and especially in space. The higher superficial infiltration rates do not lead, depending on the structure of the macropores and on the rainfall intensity or quantity, to higher soil water contents. Infiltrating water into the macropores does not infiltrate into the soil matrix and can lead as consequence of a rapid subsuperficial stormflow to piping processes.\nRAIN WATER HARVESTING TOWARDS WATER RESOURCE SUSTAINABILITY AND ECOLOGICAL REGENERATION: REMOTE SENSINGBASEDSTUDY FROMWESTERNINDIA .\nA.K.Sinha, Anup Sharma & Nazmul Hoda\nEnvironmental Geologylab, Department of Geology, University of Rajasthan, India.\nPersuant to growing environmental awareness and concern for depleting water resources at global, regional and local levelthe need and demand forimproved environmental technologies like rainwater /rainfall-runoff water harvestingis re-emerging all over the globe. The age old traditions and structuresfor rainwater harvesting in some of the water scarce regions of Asia have fallen into disuse and are attracting renew attention\nIn western India, as the deleterious effects of ground water depletion and pollution and its consequences are surfacing out a variety of responses are being forged to mitigate or even reverse these. One such response gaining popularity isreturn to the old wisdom of Rainwater Harvesting. Despite large number of dams and reservoir in India 1150Km3 of its rainwater precipitation still run off to the seas annually in the form of rejected recharge. If a fraction of this can be stored underground in an appropriate reservoir / storage system groundwater could be enhance significantly and may provide great succor to semiarid and arid regions of India which are highly water scarce region and where water table is sinking comparatively at much faster rate (10-40cm/year).\nThe paper deals withan effort to create additional storage for rainfall runofffor which a study was carried out by Remote Sensing methodto locate sites to increase residence time of rainfall runoff so thatadditional quantity of the ground water may become available. The various locales have been identified and delineated for Rainfall runoff harvestingwhichifproperly applied, would not onlyenhance the water availability but would also help toward the ecological regeneration in the region where considerable ecological degeneration has taken place during last few years due to increasing scarcity of water and prevailing drought condition.\nCLIMATE AND WATER SUSTAINABILITY IN BRUNEI DARUSSALAM\nK. U. Sirinanda\nDepartment of Geography, Faculty of Arts &Social Sciences\nUniversity of Brunei Darussalam, Bandar Seri Begawan,BE1410, Brunei Darussalam\nBrunei Darussalam (hereinafter, Brunei) has aland area of about 5765sq km and about47,000 sq km of territorial waters. The total population is about 350,000 with an average density of about 60 persons per sq km. The per capita GDP is about US$ 20,000, owing mainly to the small population and the presence ofhydrocarbon resources as the mainstay of the economy. It has a tropical-equatorial-monsoonal climate with uniformly high temperatures and copious rainfall throughout the year although a seasonality is evident in the intra-annual rainfall pattern. The atmospheric environment is generally hazard-free, occasional flash floods, relative dry conditions in certain years due to abnormal negative deviations in the rainfall, occasional strong winds, and infrequent haze phenomena notwithstanding.\nSpace-averaged annual rainfall is about 3000 mm,distribution being uneven ranging from about 2000 in the coastal areas to over 5000 in the highlands. There is no dry season as such although relatively less rainy conditions can prevailfrom January to April. With a very high drainage density it is natural that Brunei should depend on rivers as sources ofpiped water supply.Over 95 per cent ofhouseholds inurbanized areashave piped water supplies while the figure may be about 65 in the more rural areas.Due to the particularstructure of the Brunei economy, over 90 per cent of the water supply isfor domestic requirementsand only a relatively small amount is being used foragricultural andcommercial purposes. There is no significant industrial activity at present. However,with the total population estimated to double by the year2015and the plans for economic diversification through the development ofindustries, the above pattern ofdemand for water is likely to change.\nPer capita daily water consumption for domestic purposes is estimated to be about 400 litres which is considered to beon the high side.The main thrust ofpublic water supply strategies has been towards making water availableas needed.Water charges are so nominalthatwater use efficiency israther low. However, in time to come, measures may have to be in place to address the question of managing the demand side of theequation.\nThe paper will examine the water supply sustainability with reference to the climate and hydrology of the countryas well as the socio-economic factors.\nSEDIMENT AND WATER QUALITY IN THE R\u00cdO GUADIAMAR FOLLOWING THE AZNALC\u00d3LLAR TAILINGS DAM FAILURE: IMPLICATIONS FOR RIVER RECOVERY AND MANAGEMENT\nJ.

The development of monitoring network and observation program appears to be the most expensive part of this work. Taking into account the complexity of monitoring problems, the large territory of observation, the limited possibilities of the local monitoring-governing bodies, as well as the occasional location of the existing observation systems, the importance of developing adequate scientific and practical approaches to the optimization of the entire system of ground-water monitoring becomes evident.\nThe optimization of ground-water monitoring implies working out a system of scientifically valid measures aimed at selecting an adequate combination of programs (frequency of measurements, the observation duration, the density of observation network, the spatial position of observation posts, etc.) that would provide the best proportion between the reliability of the information obtained and the monitoring expenditures.\nUpon planning the ground-water monitoring, the following optimization principles should be followed:\nIt should provide database for solving as many problems of ground-water monitoring as possible;\nThe monitoring data obtained should be related to the possible methods of solving the scientific and practical problems set;\nThe optimization of ground-water monitoring can be achieved only by the step-by-step consideration of both genetic regularities of the ground-water regime formation as well as the geostatical and probabilistic analysis of the variability of the ground-water components and parameters in time and space;\nThe proportion between the required accuracy (reliability) of the information and the expenditures on its obtaining serves as the optimization criterion.\nAs proceeds from this discussion, the ground-water monitoring appears to be a multistep and complex procedure to be carried out in the following subsequent stages:\n(1) Hydrogeological zoning according to the conditions of ground-water regime formation; (2) Ecological and hydrogeological zoning aimed at solving environmental problems; (3) Application of optimization procedures based on the solution of minimax problems (within the selected areas).\nINTEGRATED CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT: THE MOOI RIVER (NORTHWEST PROVINCE, SOUTH AFRICA) AS A CASE STUDY\nI.J. van der Walt & Ben Nell\n(2) Geography & Environmental Studies, School of Environmental Sciences, Potchefstroom Univ. for Christian Higher Education, Potchefstroom 2520, South Africa\n(2) Potchefstroom City Council, Potchefstroom, 2520, South Africa\nThe city of Potchefstroom is situated at the lower end of the Mooi River catchment. Since 1842 the Mooi River has been the sole water supply of Potchefstroom, which currently has about 210 000 inhabitants.\nThe Mooi River is fed mainly by dolomitic eyes and springs.During the Mokolian age (1300 Ma), the dolomitic layers underlying the catchment were separated into various compartments by the intrusion of a swarm of syenite dykes.Since the 1940\u00eds, large-scale gold mining commenced to work the ore, which occur in the Witwatersrand sedimentary layer underlying the dolomites.To reduce the danger of flooding, many of these dolomitic compartments were de-watered by the gold mines, sometimes resulting in catastrophic environmental impacts.Furthermore, slimes dams were constructed with little regard to the underlying strata resulting in the release of large volumes of polluted water into the underlying aquifer.\nThe indiscriminate mining practices, as well as the rapid development of informal and formal settlements, various diamond mining enterprises as well as agriculture in the central and upper reaches of the catchment, resulted in a steady increase in salt loads in the water of the Mooi River, as well as the deposition of high concentrations of trace metals, especially uranium, which is associated with the gold bearing ore.Recently, it was announced that some mines in the Mooi River Catchment have reached the end of their productive lives, and that projects to re-water the dolomitic compartments were underway.\nThis paper explores the possible environmental impacts associated with re-watering the dolomitic compartments, and indicates how a lack of integrated catchment planning and management are currently exacerbating the already manifested environmental impacts.Finally, an integrated approach to the rehabilitation and restoration of the catchment to a sustainable water resource is suggested.\nTHE INFLUENCE OF SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES IN THE TROPICAL NORTH ATLANTIC AND EQUATORIAL PACIFIC ON THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF SEASONAL PRECIPITATION IN COSTA RICA.\nP. Waylen (1) & M.E. Quesada (2)\n(1) Department of Geography, University of Florida, USA, 32611-7315.\n(2) Departamento de Ciencias Sociales, Univ. de Costa Rica sede Occidentale, San Jos\u00e9.\nAlthough only small in spatial extent, Costa Rica exhibits a tremendous variability in both its precipitation regimes and the nature and degree of their interannual variability.Located between two major oceans and separating the continents of North and South America its precipitation climatology is dominated by a series of global and regional scale \u00eccentres of action\u00ee, whose influences are exaggerated by the topographic effects associated with the major northwest-southeast trending cordillera. Signals of opposing associations to ENSO have previously been detected on either side of the cordillera, however there appear to be extended periods during the historic records when this signal becomes effaced.This partially explains why this region was not initially identified as possessing a particularly strong association to ENSO.The modulation of the rainfall response appears to be the result of the interaction between the dominant frequencies associated with ENSO in the Equatorial Pacific (2-7 years) and lower frequency variability in the tropical North Atlantic (decadal). Seasonal rainfall records at over one hundred stations in Costa Rica for the period 1950-1999 are statistically compared according to the state (above/below average) of sea surface temperature anomalies in both the tropical North Atlantic (5-20?N, 30-60?W) and Ni\u00d2o3.4 (5?N-5?S, 120-170?W).The greatest and most spatially distinct response to ENSO occurs when the tropical North Atlantic has anomalously low temperatures, while a warmer than normal Atlantic appears to greatly diminish both the magnitude of response and the signal\u00eds spatial distinction on either side of the cordillera.Some stations report average seasonal rainfall departures during periods of a warm Pacific and cool Atlantic compared to those of cold Pacific and warm Atlantic, to be as large as+/- 2.25 standard deviations of the undifferentiated time series.\nTHE ROLE OF SEDIMENT IN SUSTAINABILITY. THE CASE OF ESTUARINE BARRAGES\nSue White, Steve Anderton & Tracy Nelson\nSchool of Engineering, University of Durham, South Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, UK\nSediment inputs to two estuarine barrages in the north-east of England are being monitored using a combination of continuous turbidity measurements and event-based automated sampling.A fingerprinting study of sediment sources is also underway.The aim of the study is both to quantify the inputs of sediment to the system and to understand the dynamics of sediment supply.Ultimately it is hoped that such knowledge will allow better management of the catchments and/or the barrages to minimise sedimentation problems.\nThe Wansbeck barrage, at 26 years old, is the oldest tidal barrage in the UK.It is a partial exclusion barrage allowing 30% of tides to input saline water to the impounded water body.It has extreme sediment and water quality problems.In contrast, the Tees barrage at 5 years old is one of Britain\u00eds newest.It is a total exclusion barrage with no intrusion of seawater.The catchment areas of these two barrages are quite different in size, geology, soils and land use and are influenced by differing climatic influences.These differences are reflected in the dynamics of sediment transport seen in the two rivers.\nAt the runoff event scale, sediment supply limitations and the consequences of individual supply events are evident for the Wansbeck. There is also some evidence to suggest exhaustion in sediment supply between storms in the Wansbeck, suggesting that the Wansbeck has a predominantly supply-limited suspended sediment transport regime. In contrast, the Tees initially exhibited the smoothed, lagged sedigraphs characteristic of the routing effects that occur in larger catchments.Over the first winter-spring-summer of monitoring on the Tees it appeared that sediment transport in the Tees was predominantly energy-limited.Sediment sources appeared to be dominantly in the upper reaches of the catchment.However, in the autumn of 2000 three major flood events happened within the space of one week.The sediment dynamics of the river were completely different after this week, due to the mobilisation of large amounts of sediment from river banks lower down the catchment.This change has persisted ever since.It thus became clear that the sediment supply in the Tees had also been supply limited before the flood events.Subsequent sediment dynamics are much more complex and difficult to predict.\nAt monthly and annual time scales the sediment yield per unit area was similar for the two catchments, in spite of the higher total flow volume of the Tees, until the storms of autumn 2000.Following these events, the cumulative sediment yield for the Tees far exceeds that for the Wansbeck.Such episodes of frequent high flows are one of the probable consequences of climate change and thus raise questions as to the adequacy of current sediment yield estimation techniques.\nAs a means of identifying the sources of sediments supplied to the barrages a sediment fingerprinting exercise is also underway.Here samples from potential sediment sources throughout the catchment (fields, river banks, mass movements, moorland) are analysed for their chemical signature.Statistical analysis is then used to characterise these sediment sources according to various groupings of interest: sub-catchments, geological types, land uses, soil types.At the same time, flood flows in the rivers are sampled for suspended sediment load.This is carried out at a number of sites around the catchment in an attempt to isolate different classes of sediment sources.Sediment collected from flood events undergoes the same analysis for chemical signature, and a mixing model is used to ascertain the most likely sources of the sediment moved in different flood events.It is intended that this part of the project will help to explain variations in sediment dynamics at our monitoring sites.The results may also assist in the planning of possible sediment control measures in the catchments.\nURANIUM CONTAMINATION OF RIVERS - MECHANISMS AND PROCESSES, INVESTIGATED IN MINING AREAS OF GERMANY AND SOUTH AFRICA. PART 1: HYDROCHEMICAL BEHAVIOUR OF URANIUM ALONG THE AQUEOUS PATHWAY - PITFALL KOEKEMOERSPRUIT (SOUTH AFRICA)\nF Winde\nUniversity of Jena, Department for Geography, L\u00f6bdergraben 32, D-07743 Jena, Germany\nPotchefstroom University for CHE, Dep. for Geography and Environmental Studies, Potchefstroom, Republic of South Africa\nTailings deposits from gold- and uranium mining often containing high amounts of radioactive and chemotoxical heavy metals. By seepage and waterborne transport dissolved uranium and other contaminants migrating into the groundwater, finally entering adjacent fluvial systems. The subsequent transport in rivers is one of the most efficient pathways of distributing contaminants throughout the biosphere. In a comparative study of mining areas in Germany (Wismut area in East-Thuringia) and South Africa (goldmines on the Witwatersrandformation) mechanisms of non-point river contamination and the fluvial transport of uranium were investigated. As part of the investigation, the hydraulic interaction between the surface water and ground water (as diffuse source of river contamination), as well as the hydrochemical environment within the river and its sediments were tracked in real-time with computerised data logger in situ-measurements.\nIn this paper results to the hydrogeochemical behaviour of uranium at the Koekemoerspruit (South Africa) are presented.\nDespite a negative annual water balance, the waterborne transportation of dissolved uranium and other heavy metals leaching from gold tailings (slimes dams) constitutes a major source of diffuse river contamination in South Africa. Due to the vast volume of deposited tailings in the densely populated gold mining areas, a better understanding of transportation mechanisms and the immobilisation of pollutants is needed in order to develop adequate water management strategies in South Africa. The worldwide decline in uranium production resulted in increased concentrations of uranium being deposited onto the slimes dams, thereby considerably worsening the problem.\nIn the Koekemoerspruit - which constitutes a typical mining affected river in the Klerksdorp Goldfield - the solute transport of dissolved uranium along the aqueous pathway was investigated. Ratios between dissolved and solid phases of uranium for various water-sediment-systems along the aqueous pathway were calculated.Contrary to expectations, a significantly higher rate of uranium binding on sediments in the running water system than on the highly sorptive sediments of the associated ground water system underlying the floodplain, was found. Geochemical correlation suggests that in flowing waters immobilisation is caused mainly by precipitation of carbonates and insoluble iron/manganese-compounds, rather than by adsorption processes. Co-precipitation of uranium and other dissolved metals results in them binding onto sediments. The formation of hydrous iron- and manganese-oxides and -hydroxides in particular, take place within sediments in the river channel.At the ground water-surface water interface in the river channel, mixing between reducing ground water and oxidising river water causes redox-initiated precipitation. Thus, bottom sediments act as a geochemical barrier as well as a sink for dissolved uranium being transported from the slimes dam to the river. The binding of uranium in neutral charged uranyl-sulfate-complexes simultaneously prevents the cation from stronger adsorption on floodplain sediments. However, the evaporation of ascending ground water results in superficial salt crusts on the floodplain sediments, containing very high concentrations of uranium. Due to re-solution by rainwater, such salt crusts easily turn from sinks into sources of uranium causing peaks of solute concentration in rivers.\nURANIUM CONTAMINATION OF RIVERS - MECHANISMS AND PROCESSES, INVESTIGATED IN MINING AREAS OF GERMANY AND SOUTH AFRICA. PART 2: DYNAMICS OF GROUNDWATER-SURFACE WATER INTERACTION\nF Winde (1) & I.J. van der Walt (2)\n(1) University of Jena, Department for Geography, L\u00f6bdergraben 32, D-07743 Jena, Germany.\n(2) Potchefstroom University for CHE, Department for Geography and Environmental Studies, 2520 Potchefstroom, Republic of South Africa.\nA computerised datalogger with 16 probes measuring with 10 minute intervals i.a. the water level in the stream, ground water levels, precipitation, temperature, pH and redox potential of the river water as well as the ground water, was installed in the Lerchenbach (a tributary to the Weisse Elster in the Wismut area of East-Thurungia, Germany), as well as in the Koekemoerspruit (a tributary of the Vaal River in the NorthWest Province, South Africa) to track the fluvial transport mechanism of pollution, especially uranium.\nRecent sources of river contamination with uranium in South Africa are mainly connected to gold mining activities. Possible mechanisms of contamination are the transfer of uranium bearing slimes particles into adjacent river channels (e.g. by wind and water erosion of tailing dams, stability failures of slimes dams, spills etc.) as well as the input of dissolved uranium into the hydrological cycle. With respect to the latter one can distinguish between contaminated mine effluent directly discharged into rivers (point sources) and pollution resulting from seepage from slimes dams migrating via aquifers into the receiving watercourses (diffuse sources).\nIn both regions uranium and other heavy metals are contaminating the ground water of the associated floodplains as a result of seepage from slimes dams. This contaminated ground water is the main source of diffuse pollution of the river channels. The extent of river contamination therefore depends on the concentration of dissolved uranium in the groundwater and the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments. To track river-groundwater interactions, the water levels in the river (gauging weir) and the groundwater levels were measured by piezometric probes. In both sites significant hydraulic interactions between the river and the ground water were found.\nDespite a permanent steep hydraulic gradient from the water-saturated tailing deposits to the receiving water course in general, under certain conditions the overwhelming exfiltration, which constitutes the baseflow in the river, can turn into infiltration. In case of the Koekemoerspruit, where the water level in the river is mainly controlled by a pumping scheme from the goldmines, this infiltration / exfiltration cycle occurs daily. Because the pumping of ground water into the river is not constant (mainly due to cheaper electricity during off-peak times), pronounced water level changes occur in the river on a daily and a weekly basis, allowing for contaminated ground water to seep into the river channel only at night time, making it highly unlikely that elevated levels of uranium in the river water will be picked up by normal monitoring practices.\nTime series data of EC from the Lerchenbach show that during flood events, the highly contaminated porewater from the bottom sediments is completely replaced within a few hours by cleaner surface water infiltrating into the sediments. The reverse process, however, takes up to two weeks. Besides the input of polluted porewater into the running water column, the sudden change of the chemical composition of the porewater during flood conditions (to an oxidising environment) may affect the immobilisation and re-mobilisation of dissolved uranium in the sediment, resulting in individual pulses of contamination moving downstream.\nURANIUM CONTAMINATION OF RIVERS - MECHANISMS AND PROCESSES, INVESTIGATED IN MINING AREAS OF GERMANY AND SOUTH AFRICA. PART 3: DIURNAL AND EVENT-RELATED FLUCTUATIONS OF HYDROCHEMICAL PARAMETERS IN RIVER WATER\nF Winde\nUniversity of Jena, Department for Geography, L\u00f6bdergraben 32, D-07743 Jena, Germany\nPotchefstroom University for CHE, Geography and Environmental Studies, 2520 Potchefstroom, Republic of South Africa\nIn this paper, results from data-logger measurements of river chemistry in the Koekemoerspruit (South Africa) and the Lerchenbach (Germany) are presented.\nThe hazardous potential of tailing deposits mainly depends on the ease with which their toxic constituents are able to migrate in the dissolved phase along the aqueous pathway into the receiving environment. In the case of uranium and other heavy metals, the mobility is strongly influenced by their speciation. It not only determines whether a metal will be in the dissolved or solid phase, but also to what extent a dissolved element can bind to or is released from adsorbents in a water-sediment system. Speciation in its turn, depends on the concentration of the metal in the solution, its ionic composition as well as \u00f1 to a great extent - on the pH and the redox potential (Eh). To investigate this relationship, sensors measuring pH, Eh, water-temperature (t) and electric conductivity (EC) were placed in the river, providing data with ten-minute intervals over a period of 24 months (Lerchenbach) and 18 months (Koekemoerspruit) respectively.\nA statistical time series analyses of the pH of the running water revealed pronounced diurnal cycles with maximal daily changes from 0.7 to 2 units in the Koekemoerspruit and the Lerchenbach respectively. Simultaneously, the EC and the redox potential of the river water fluctuate daily as well, with Eh showing an inverse correlation with pH. Interactions and dependencies between the parameters, as well as possible causes of the cyclic behaviour are discussed.\nBesides being responsible for changes in metal speciation, these fluctuations in the river chemistry are also likely to affect the precipitation of hydrous iron and manganese oxides and hydroxides, which is an important immobilisation process for dissolved uranium in rivers. This is partly due to the exceedence of certain thresholds during the diurnal cycle and partly due to the acceleration/inhibition of the precipitation rate itself.For example, the formation of manganese oxides only occurs when the pH is greater than 8.5, while the rate of Fe(OH)3-precipitation is amplified by a factor of 100 if the pH increases by half a unit. The precipitation of carbonates is controlled by similar interactions. The impact of Eh-fluctuations seems not to be as important for uranium mobility since the range of change is significantly smaller than for pH.\nBeside diurnal fluctuations during dry weather conditions, it seems that weather conditions, especially precipitation, also result in changes in the river chemistry (e.g. acid rain related decreases of pH in the river). The possibility of weather induced remobilization of uranium and other heavy metals from sediments, resulting in short duration peaks of pollution, is also discussed.\nENSO (EL NI\u00d1O-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION) AND ANNUAL FLOODS IN WESTERN CANADA\nMing-ko Woo & Robin Thorne\nSchool of Geography and Geology, McMaster Univ, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada L8S 4K1\nAnnual floods in western Canada are usually generated by winter rainfall or spring snowmelt events.Previous studies have found strong correlations between the December to February precipitation for most parts of western Canada and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), suggesting that the annual floods may be affected by ENSO events.This study explores such relationships by extracting the annual floods from 140 western rivers with at least 25 years of record, for correlation with the average SOI for October to March. One-third of the rivers show positive correlation with the Oct-Mar SOI, suggesting that these rivers have lower than average annual floods during the El Ni\u00f1o years, but the reverse for the La Ni\u00f1a years.The overall spatial pattern of correlation indicates patches with high r2 confined within a triangular area with the base extending from interior southern British Columbia to southern Saskatchewan, and the apex at the triple-boundary of British Columbia, Yukon and Northwest Territories.Within this broadly defined area, the coastal belt, the Peace River basin and the foothills of the Rockies show low r2 values. There appears to be a correspondence between the major rain shadows and the clusters of low r2 .\nThe general pattern of correlation between annual floods in western Canada and SOI may be accounted for by the teleconnection between winter precipitation anomaly and southern oscillation. During El Ni\u00f1o years, a southward shift of the subtropical branch and a northward shift of the polar branch of the jet stream leave the southern part of western Canada and the Pacific Northwest of United States with lower than normal precipitation, hence generating lesser peak flows.The precipitation contrasts between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a years may be amplified on the windward slopes while the effects are dampened in the rain shadow areas.\nAs winter and spring floods are both hazards and opportunities to recharge the reservoirs, an understanding of the linkages between annual floods and SOI will allow such hydrologic events to be related to the atmospheric phenomena.\n"}, {"score": 1397.5863, "uuid": "8dc5034c-6b45-542f-9358-f6dce172806c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1505wb-53-06576", "target_hostname": "www.naturalsolutions1.com", "target_uri": "http://www.naturalsolutions1.com/ecodist2.htm", "page_rank": 1.3236798e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "<em>Water</em> Distillers - <em>Water</em> Distillation - Myths, Facts, etc...", "snippet": "Distilled <em>water</em> <em>is</em> also used when pure <em>water</em> <em>is</em> needed <em>for</em> <em>for</em> such things as Photo Processing, Pharmaceuticals, Perfumes, Facial Products, Cosmetic Products, Laboratories, <em>Plant</em> <em>Water</em>, Rinse <em>Water</em>, etc... <em>Water</em> distillation <em>is</em> an effective process <em>for</em> producing highly treated drinking <em>water</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Water Distillers Water Distillation distiller Myths\nWater Distillation - Water Distillers and Distilled Water - Myths and Facts!\nMyths, false statements, intentional consumer misleading and misinformation and extreme personal views. Call them what you will, there is a lot of poor non-factual, non-scietific information out there when it is in reference to water distillation, water distillers and drinking distilled water.\nSome of this misinformation come from or is used by water filter and super duper water machine sellers who do not sell, or do not understand water distillation. This is'nt anything new since many of the myths about water distillers have been around for 10 to 15 years. The difference today is that people (consumers) are more aware of their health and their drinking water and they are more of an informed consumer.\nConsumers see in the news about the water problems. How many of you have seen or been given \"Boiling Notices\" for your drinking water because of Bacteria or Cryptosporidium? We hear today more about Cryptosporidium problems then ever. We also hear about Water Distillation being one of the most consistent and purest forms of water purification.\nHow many of you been on a Diet? Most all diets recommend Distilled water, or at least, Reverse osmosis water. Many Health related books suggest drinking distilled water.\nWhether it is plain ignorance or intentional misleading, we still find many filter and super duper water machine dealers un-educated today and still putting down water distillation and distillers. The only answer to this that we can come up with is either (A) they don't understand distillation, or (B) they simply are trying to mislead a consumer to sell their filter product. Unfortunately, some still use these myths and false statements about distillation as scare tactics to sell their own product and it is truely sad.\nWe have even seen published on web sites that drinking distilled water somehow can cause an early death of individuals! It is amazing to us the ignorance and deception used by many to make consumers afraid of distilled water. For them to make bold statements such as this you MUST insist on getting from these people the \"Credible Scientific Evidence\" which proves their statements that distilled water is a health hazard. Most all of the time you will find that they simply say it is their opinion, which means, they have NO \"Credible Scientific Evidence\" or they will simply give you a quick statement from a book it came from. You want the Independent \"Credible Scientific Evidence\".\nWATER DISTILLATION FACTS:\nA FACT that can not be disputed is that water distillation removes the broadest range of contaminants over any other form of point of use (POU) water treatment system.\nAnother FACT is that distilled water comes THE CLOSEST to the definition of PURE DRINKING WATER H20\nand unlike filtration, it is consistent, un-disputed!\nEven another FACT is that\nwater distillation is\nthe most effective method for the removal of organic, inorganic and biological (bacteria, viruses, etc.) contaminants.\nDistillation removes a greater percentage of these harmful impurities than reverse osmosis (RO), Ultraviolet (UV), filtering and other methods of purification. Also, these other methods lose their effectivness and must be serviced and are not as consistent as water distillation.\nDistillation and water distilling is not a new process but in fact, a very old method of cleaning up and purifying water.\nThe definition of DISTILLATION\nis: \"the process of heating a mixture and condensing the resulting vapor to produce a more nearly pure substance\".\nDistillation is as old as the earth. Nature uses a form of distillation called \"Hydrologic Cycle\". This natural distillation method is where the sun heats the water on the earth's surface. The water is turned into a vapor (evaporation) and rises, leaving contaminants behind, to form clouds. As the upper atmosphere drops in temperature the vapors cool and convert back to water to form water droplets. When the water droplets drop to the earth's surface, as snow or rain (precipitation), the cycle repeats again. This cycle is also known as Nature's Air Purification system because the water that falls in the form of rain or snow collect from the air dirt and air pollutant particles bringing them to the ground - cleaning the air.\nWhen did humans start understanding and using distillation?\nA form of distillation was used by ancient Greek sailors. They use to hang sponges over pots of boiling sea (salt) water. They would then squeeze out the collected water from the sponges. They did this because they found that the water squeezed out from the sponges was not salty and was drinkable. Today, the US Navy uses distilled water derived from sea water for drinking water on-board ships.\nWater Distillers today are simply a man-made form of replicating Nature's \"Hydrologic Cycle\" method of producing pure water. Distillation is generally recognized as an effective broad spectrum water treatment method and removes many different kinds of contaminants including biological contaminants such as bacteria and viruses.\nDistilled water, besides being the best for Drinking and Cooking water, is used for a variety of applications. Distilled water is best for use in Home Aquariums and Fish Tanks, Home Appliances such as Irons and Humidifiers and is used in Wet-Celled Batteries.\nDistilled water is also used when pure water is needed for for such things as Photo Processing, Pharmaceuticals, Perfumes, Facial Products, Cosmetic Products, Laboratories, Plant Water, Rinse Water, etc...\nWhat Distiller Units Treat!\nWater distillation is an effective process for producing highly treated drinking water. Water distillation can significantly reduce levels of sediment, metals, and biological contaminants, which are unable to travel out of the boiling chamber with the steam. When combined with effective activated carbon filtration or using the newer style distillers with VOC venting, contaminants like VOCs and radon can also be controlled. It is recommended that only units designed and tested for health-contaminant reduction be used for such purposes. Water distillation, when combined with activated carbon filtration and or VOC venting, can be used to effectively treat such contaminants as:\nArsenic\n"}, {"score": 1394.6372, "uuid": "0a98c0dd-b935-5733-9001-82778cd6f35e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1216wb-98-11131", "target_hostname": "www.rdc.govt.nz", "target_uri": "http://www.rdc.govt.nz/Services/Water/WaterConservation.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1785501e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "<em>Water</em> Conservation - Rotorua District Council", "snippet": "A slow drip from a <em>tap</em> can waste more <em>than</em> 200 litres of <em>water</em> per day.

Test by stepping on the grass. If the grass springs back up when you move, the lawn doesn't need watering.\nDeep soak your lawn. While giving the lawn a quick drink every night may be good therapy for you, it makes the grass shallow rooted and dependent on the meagre amount of water that you provide. Water a maximum of twice a week, but for longer. This enables the roots to grow deeper, which makes your lawn hardier.\nReduce lawn area. This has the additional benefit of reducing your mowing.\nCheck your local nursery for a suitable drought-tolerant lawn grass for your area.\nLet the lawn go brown during very dry times. When the rain comes the transformation from brown to green will be dramatic.\nFeed but do not over-fertilise.\nAerate the soil to allow water to be absorbed more easily.\nDo not mow to a height of less than 2 centimetres. Taller grass holds water better.\nUse a timer with your sprinkler. A forgotten sprinkler wastes more than a 1000 litres per hour.\nYour garden\nUse a good mulch. Mulch can prevent up to 73% evaporation loss. It can also prevent excessive run-off, restrict weed growth, improve soil structure and help put valuable nutrients back into the soil.\nGroup plants according to how much water they require, to avoid wasting water on plants that don't need it.\nToughen up your plants. Wait until the soil dries out before watering. Use a plant such as bamboo as an indicator. When the leaves start to droop, water.\nWater the highest parts of the garden first, so that run-off water soaks into lower dry areas.\nRemove weeds. Weeds compete for water and nutrients.\nDig small trenches around trees. These give water a chance to soak in, reducing water lost as run-off.\nWater your pot plants by dunking them in a bucket of water. Wait a few seconds and when the bubbles disappear, do the next pot.\nWater during cooler parts of the day. Avoid watering on windy days.\nWater the roots not the leaves. If you water the leaves, water is lost through evaporation.\nPosition your sprinklers so that water lands on the lawn or garden, not on paved areas.\nPlant drought-resistant native trees and plants. Many natives thrive with far less watering than other species.\nWater wisely to avoid run-off. Soil and dissolved nutrients are carried away with run-off.\nUse a trigger hose, so that you are in control. Remember to turn the tap off when finished in case pressure build-up causes the nozzle to pop off.\nThe yard\nDiscourage games with the hose and sprinklers.\nUse a broom rather than a hose to clean driveways and footpaths.\nUse a compost bin. Compost increases the moisture-holding capacity of sandy soils and allows better penetration of water into heavy clay soils.\nThe swimming pool\nCover your pool to reduce evaporation, retain warmth and keep out leaves and dirt. Up to 200 litres of water per day can be lost through evaporation from a typical in-ground pool.\nAccept some fluctuation in pool level. Evaporation and rainfall often compensate for each other, and topping up with the hose can be avoided.\nCheck the pool for leaks.\nWashing the car, boat or caravan\nUse a bucket and sponge to wash the car, boat or caravan. Use the hose only for rinsing and turn it off between rinses.\nWash the car, boat or caravan on the lawn instead of on the driveway.\nIn the bathroom\nInstall a dual flush toilet, which allows you to flush either half or all of the cistern's water. Traditional toilets can usually be converted to dual flush.\nTake shorter showers.\nInstall a water-saving shower rose. Many showers put out 20 litres of water per minute, but 10 litres per minute is enough.\nDon\u2019t leave the tap running while brushing your teeth.\nDon't rinse your razor under a running tap. Fill the sink with a little warm water for rinsing.\nIn the laundry\nMake sure the washing machine's load adjustment is right for the load. If there's no load adjustment, wait until you have enough clothes for a full load. Washing machines use 100 - 200 litres of water per load.\nFront-loading machines are generally more efficient than top loaders and save water and power. Use the sud-saver option when you have several loads.\nIn the kitchen\nWhen washing dishes by hand, don't rinse them under a running tap. If you have two sinks, fill the second one with rinsing water. If you have only one sink, stack washed dishes in a dish rack and rinse them with a pan of hot water.\nDon't run the automatic dishwasher until you have a full load.\nDon't let the tap run when cleaning vegetables. Just rinse them in a plugged sink or a pan of clean water.\nKeep a bottle of drinking water in the refrigerator, to avoid running the tap until the water is cool enough to drink.\nAerating taps are inexpensive and can reduce water flow by 50%.\nWhen cooking, use only a little water in the saucepan and keep the lid on.\nAvoid using a garbage disposal unit.

Always nagging you to \"Turn off the lights\", \"Make sure you turn off that tap\", and a bunch of other stuff.\nWe hate to tell you this, but they are right! Wasting water and electricity not only wastes money, but it wastes our natural resources too. The more energy we use, the greater the demand on our power suppliers.\nFrom the page on Water Facts, we have seen that only 1% of all the water in the world is available to be used as drinking water. Although this water keeps getting recycled through the Earth\u0092s ecosystem, once that water is polluted, it is hard to get it back to a useable state.\nStratford has a unique water system\u0085 We use water which comes from artesian wells, deep under the ground. Let\u0092s help to protect our water so that there will be enough for everyone!\nHere are a few things that you can do at home to help save water and electrical power, as well as helping to keep our water system pure for drinking:\nWhen brushing your teeth, rinse the brush in short bursts of water instead of leaving the water running. This can save a LOT of water.\nEven a little drip can waste lots of water. When you are finished using the sink be sure that you REALLY turn off that tap. (This also helps you develop those muscles!) If the tap leaks, ask your mom or dad to replace the washer. (The washer is a little seal inside the tap that keeps it from leaking.)\nWhen you take showers, make sure they are short ones (less than 8 minutes). Taking a short shower can use less water than taking a bath. However, taking a shallow bath uses less water than taking a long shower.\nNext time you take a shower, time yourself and try leaving the plug in the drain and see just exactly how much water you are using. If the tub overflows, that\u0092s WAY too much!!!!\nWalk over to the toilet and listen to the tank. Do you hear a hissing sound? If you do, you have a leaky valve! Ask your mom or dad to fix it\u0085 a leaky toilet can waste hundreds, even thousands of gallons of water.\nIn the summer, instead of running the tap for a long time until the water gets cold enough to drink, keep a nice cold jug of water in the fridge. (Ice cubes cool off a drink quickly too!)\nWhile waiting for tap water to get hot, catch it in a jug or bucket to use for watering plants.\nIf you like to play in the sprinklers in the summertime, do it only when your parents are going to water the lawn anyway! Better yet, fill up a wading pool to cool off instead and use the water on the garden or to wash the car afterwards.\nIt uses less water to wash the car with a bucket of soapy water than with the spray from a garden hose. Just use the hose for your final rinse.\nTo clean your driveway or walks, sweep them instead of spraying them down with a hose.\nHere are some other ways to help the environment:\nDid you know that in Stratford, all the water that flows into the rain gutters and catch basins flows directly into the Avon River? This water, unlike the water we flush down the drains in our homes, does not go to the Waste Water Treatment plant. This is a very good reason not to pour waste household chemicals or other hazardous materials into the storm drains. Just one gallon of gasoline allowed to flow into a storm drain can contaminate 750,000 gallons of water! It's also not a good idea to pour chemicals like these into household drains or flush them down the toilet.\nLikewise, chemicals poured into the ground and those that end up in landfills, even if they are in a container, pollute the water table. Be sure you dispose of household hazardous chemicals properly, not by putting them in your trash or pouring them down the drains. The City periodically has Hazardous Household Waste drop-offs. Call the City of Stratford or click here for details regarding the Household Hazardous Waste Program to find out when the next drop-off will take place, and ask your family to take these items to the dump for safe disposal.\n"}, {"score": 1393.8849, "uuid": "7e3ae294-da83-5578-af23-0c2980897712", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0409wb-81-25238", "target_hostname": "www.foodandwaterwatch.org", "target_uri": "http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/blog_categories/bottled-water/blogs/", "page_rank": 1.2334235e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "Blogs | Food &amp; <em>Water</em> Watch", "snippet": "No doubt it will give Whole Foods naysayers more fodder <em>for</em> calling it Whole Paycheck, since bottled <em>water</em> <em>is</em> thousands of times more expensive <em>than</em> <em>tap</em> <em>water</em>.

It does not cause mineral loss but in fact takes out harmful toxins from the body.\nDistilled Water VS Mineral, Carbon Filtered and Reverse Osmosis Water\nRon Kennedy, M.D.\nThere is circulating a point of view about distilled water, undoubtedly promulgated by producers and sellers of mineral water. This point of view is that water should be mineralized in order to have health benefits and that distilled water somehow leaches out minerals from the body.\nTo understand the truth about this matter one must know a little about mineral chemistry in living systems. In order for a mineral to be of any use to the body it must be presented in a form in which it can be used. That form involves an association with an organic (carbon based) molecule. Carbon based molecules are to be found in living systems, and are not found in the ground which is where mineral water comes from. Water from the ground comes with minerals alright, but these minerals are in salt form. When salt is presented to the body (with rare exceptions such as sodium chloride) it must be either stored or excreted. A good example is CaCO3 (calcium carbonate). Carbonate is not a sufficiently complex organic molecule and therefore cannot properly contribute its calcium to living systems. The calcium comes out instead in ionic form (with a positive charge) and precipitates by forming other salts. Common locations for precipitation of calcium are the lens of the eye (cataracts), the kidneys (kidney stones) and the walls of arteries (arteriosclerosis). Unbound minerals must be excreted, which is extra work for the kidneys) or stored. This makes dust of the argument that healthy water is mineralized, and dust is of course the source of minerals in mineral water.\nIncidentally, CaCO3 comes from lime stone and comprises the bulk of most calcium supplements, including that in \u201ccalcium enriched orange juice.\u201d If you want cataracts, kidney stones, and arteriosclerosis, be sure to eat and drink \u201ccalcium enriched\u201d foods.\nNow as to the argument that distilled water leaches out minerals. This is true, and this is exactly what we want it to do. The minerals it leaches out are of the unusable, ionic form and we want these to leave the body rather than be deposited and cause disease. Distilled water does not leach out significant amounts of biologically available minerals because these are quickly taken up by the body on an as needed basis. If they are present in excess then they are filtered through the kidneys and this is exactly what needs to happen with all things which are in excess in the circulation. Distilled water cleanses the body through promoting healthy kidney function.\nFinally, if mineral water is not a good source of biologically available minerals, then what is? Think about it. Minerals are present in the ground and must be biologically bound in order to be used by the body. Where would that come from? Plants, or course! Your mineral source should be plants not water. The purpose of water is to cleanse the body. To do the best job of that, it must be free of everything else. Only distilled water fits that bill.\nAs to carbon filtered and reverse osmosis water, these are better solutions than tap water or mineral water, however they still fall far short of the standard set by distilled water.\nNature knows best and nature supplies distilled water in the form of rain. However, rain water is no longer pure due to atmospheric pollution. The only remaining option is for us to distill our own water.\nIf you would like to read more I recommend two books: The Truth About Water and Your Body\u2019s many Cries For Water.\n"}], [{"score": 1390.5054, "uuid": "fffb386d-8f31-5498-96a4-c766441a6c5a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1905wb-07-01067", "target_hostname": "www.whollyh2o.org", "target_uri": "http://www.whollyh2o.org/resources/tips/item/60-efficiency-tips.html", "page_rank": 1.2189869e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "General <em>Water</em> Efficiency Tips", "snippet": "<em>For</em> a manual graywater system, put a bucket under the faucet while your shower <em>water</em> <em>is</em> heating up and then use that <em>water</em> to flush your toilet.

A leaky toilet can waste 200 gallons per day. If you are unsure whether you have a leak, read your water meter before and after a two-hour period when no water is being used. If the meter does not read exactly the same, you probably have a leak. If you have a well at home, check your pump periodically. If the pump turns on and off while the water is not in use, you have a leak.\nSavings: 8 - 200 gallons per day\nJust Add Air\nYou can double the efficiency of a kitchen faucet made before 1994 by installing a low-flow aerator. This quick, cost-efficient project, along with a change in habits, can save hundreds of gallons a year.\nSavings: 100s of gallons a year\nBathing for Dollars\nA full bathtub requires about 70 gallons of water, while taking a five-minute shower uses 10 to 25 gallons. If you take a bath, stopper the drain immediately and adjust the temperature as you fill the tub.\nSavings: 45 \u2013 60 gallons per shower (per person)\nShower Shortage\nA four-minute shower uses approximately 20 to 40 gallons of water.

Scrape, rather than washing plates before you load them. Air dry and only wash full loads.\nSavings: 3-12 gallons per load\nTame Your Toilet\nYour toilet's tank is full of treated drinking water. This means that energy is being wasted to clean water that will be mixed with urine and feces and flushed away, only to be treated again! If your toilet is from 1992 or earlier, you probably have an inefficient model that uses at least 3.5 gallons per flush. New and improved high-efficiency models use less than 1.3 gallons per flush. That's at least 60 percent less than their older, less efficient counterparts. If you can't afford a new toilet, then put a brick or filled water bottle in the tank to reduce the amount needed to fill the tank.\nSavings: 2.2 gallons per flush\nSmart Flushing\nWith each toilet flush, we are literally throwing water imported from outside our watersheds and then heavily treated to drinking standards down the toilet. Why not install a rainwater and/or graywater system, which can fill your tank with properly treated water you've harvested yourself? For a manual graywater system, put a bucket under the faucet while your shower water is heating up and then use that water to flush your toilet.\nSay \"No!\" to Flow\nTurn off your kitchen sink instead of letting the water run over dishes and vegetables. Better to partially fill up a small tub or bowl for rinsing. When you are done, you can pour the water into the soil around nonedible plants. When washing dishes by hand, use the least amount of detergent possible. This minimizes the rinse water needed. Don't turn on your faucet full blast when just a trickle of water will do.\nGarbage In, Water Out\nIn-sink garbage disposals require lots of water, and add considerably to the volume of solids delivered to waste water systems and septic tanks. Start a compost pile or worm composter for kitchen scraps as an alternative method for disposing of food waste. You can use the compost on your water-wise garden or contribute to your city's compost pick-up plan.\nSavings: 50-150 gallons per month\nRecyclables Relief\nOnly rinse recyclables with minimal water before putting them in collection bins. Plastics with food residue may need wiping, but glass & metal is recycled at high temperatures that vaporize food.\nBrooms - Not Just for Witches Anymore\nUse a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways and sidewalks. This saves as much as 150 gallons of water each time.\nSavings: 150 gallons per cleaning\nDevise a Device\nNow that saving water has become popular, you can add many water saving appliances, such as low-flow faucets, low-flow toilets, low-flow showerheads, water efficient laundry and dishwashers. There are many rebates throughout California available for these items. Visit our products page [LINK] to find the water savers appropriate for you.\nSavings: Thousands of gallons a year.\nJust Add Hot Water\nInstalling an on-demand water heater will reduce the amount of water you waste waiting for the water to heat. While waiting you can also capture running water in a bucket, and distribute it to your needy plants. Better yet, install a graywater system.\nCool Cycle\nCollect water drips from air conditioning units or collection buckets on dehumidifiers for use on plants or trees.\nPool Party\nAvoid evaporation by keeping your pool covered. About 95% of pool water that is lost to evaporation can be saved with the use of a cover.\nLower pool level to avoid splash-out. Water that is unavoidably splashed out can be channeled onto the landscape or back into the pool.\nReduce the water used to back-flush pool filters.\nCheck the pool regularly for cracks and leaks (including pressure grouting, liners and drain valves) and make repairs regularly.\n\"Harvest\" pool backwash for plants when chlorine levels are less than 3 ppm.\nYou can keep it full with properly filtered rainwater that you have harvested and stored on site.\nFish Poop Soup\nWhen cleaning out fish tanks, give the nutrient-rich water to your plants.

Consequently, the majority of rural communities are still drinking superficial water that does not meet the required standard of quality, causing serious health problems.\nIn many cases, the high cost of water treatment systems and the poor quality of water deter investment in even the simplest systems of untreated water conveyance by gravity, further aggravating the health situation and forcing the population \u2013 particularly women and children \u2013 to walk long distances to fetch water of a worse quality than that which they could obtain by conveyance from the headwaters of nearby rivers.\nSlow sand filtration systems are a technically viable water treatment solution. Nevertheless, there are still a number of difficulties involved in the implementation of the technology and the operation of the system. In addition, the direct cost of the construction is relatively high. A large percentage of these systems have been abandoned for the following reasons:\nInappropriate designs, as the variations in the quality of water at different times of the year were not taken into account.\nThe people in charge of operating them are usually members of the community who have not been adequately trained to operate the system.\nThe institutions responsible do not monitor the installations adequately.\nSpare parts are not locally available.\nThe sand on the filter bed is not replaced when the minimum thickness has been reached, after several layers have been scraped off.\nThe main characteristic of slow sand filtration is that, due to the effect of biological activity, it efficiently removes pathogenic organisms from raw water, particularly the bacteria and viruses responsible for transmitting water-related diseases. Furthermore, no chemical products are required, nor highly qualified, continual supervision.\nSlow filtration is undoubtedly the most adequate technology for rural areas. In order to avoid some of the problems described, however, it is necessary to apply solutions that take into account local technical and economic capacities, so that the system can actually achieve its purpose to supply drinking water to rural populations.\nThe proposal contained in this handbook is a low-cost alternative that is technically adequate and easily managed by the community. It consists of modified gravel pre-filtration, slow sand filtration and disinfection units adapted\nDESIGN\nBefore embarking on a treated water supply project, it is essential to evaluate and define the level of organisation in the community. If it is insufficient or non- existent then the operation and maintenance of the system will most likely be neglected and eventually abandoned.\nThe community must participate in every stage of the installation of the water supply service, including the selection of the technical option, the construction and supervision of the works and the management of the service.\nIn the design stage, the community must study the proposed solutions and decide upon the best technical alternative and the most appropriate service. Consequently, they must be aware of the costs of the system \u2013 including their own contribution to the construction and the rates to be paid, the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative and their operation and maintenance responsibilities (UNDP 1998).\nThe following factors must be borne in mind for a preliminary study to define possible water treatment solutions:\nWeather conditions\u00a0: The temperature has a substantial influence on the performance of water treatment systems and the intensity and duration of the rain influences the quantity and quality of the source.\nWatershed characteristics\u00a0: Human and natural factors, such as discharges of residual water or run-off from chemically treated farmland, can seriously affect the quality of the water.\nQuality of the water\u00a0: A physical, chemical and bacteriological analysis of the water is necessary in order to determine its quality and the level of treatment required.\nLocation of the plant\u00a0: The land must be easily accessible, having a natural slope of between 5 and 10% and having no exposure to natural hazards or to subterranean water nearby. A written agreement with the owner must be signed.\nCharacteristics of the community\u00a0: It is necessary to know the customs and beliefs that could affect the acceptance of the system, the\ncharacteristics of existing organisations, the availability of natural materials and human resources, and the level of schooling.\nExistence of water-related diseases.\nThe selection of water treatment processes as a possible solution for supplying drinking water to rural communities depends on the quality of the raw water.\nP = Pre-sedimentation S = Sedimentation PC = Gravel Pre-filter in layers with an ascending flow PS = Gravel Pre-filter in series with vertical or horizontal flows FL = Slow sand filter C = Sieve\nIf the water contains faecal coliforms and turbidity levels that exceed the values shown in the table, it is advisable to look for other water sources.\nAt the entrance to the plant, a triangular weir structure should be considered to measure the flow, in which the desired water should be marked with paint. The operator can open the inlet valve to reproduce the flow required to operate the system.\nAERATION\nAeration consists of blending the water with the air in order to:\nIncrease the oxygen content in the water\nIncrease the pH in the water by reducing its carbon dioxide content\nRemove the iron, magnesium, hydrogen sulphate, methane and various volatile organic compounds responsible for the flavour and smell of the\nwater (Hofkes et al, 1987).\nThe simplest aeration methods are described below:\nMultiple tray aerator\nThis is an economical solution that occupies little space. It consists of four to eight trays with mesh bottoms, placed one on top of another with a 30-50cm space between them. The water is evenly distributed in the first tray through porous pipes, or by stopping the gush with a bar (as shown in the figure), so that the water trickles into the tray at a rate of 0.02 m3/s per square metre of the tray\u2019s surface. Small droplets are then sprayed into the next tray. The trays can be made of various materials: asbestos-cement sheets, plastic pipes with small diameters or parallel wooden slats.To obtain a finer spray, the aerator trays can be filled with thick gravel approximately 10cm deep.\nFig 2: Wooden trays brake water up into droplets\nCascade aerator\nThis consists of either four or six steps, each 30cm high and having a capacity of approximately 0,01 m3/sec per metre of width. An obstacle is often placed at the edge of each step to produce turbulence and thus improve the aeration efficiency,\nAlthough more space is required than for multiple tray aerators, less head is lost and no maintenance is required.\nPRE-FILTRATION\nMany designs of water treatment plants fail to take into account the differences in the quality of water, particularly during the rainy season when turbidity increases, obstructing filters and reducing their effectiveness. Hence the need to previously clear the water through different processes, including pre-filtration, which not only removes turbidity but also algae and bacteria, lengthening the life of the filters and reducing the cleaning frequency (Collins et al, 1991).\nAlthough the efficiency of ascending and descending flow pre-filters is similar, the former are easier to maintain as the hydraulic retro-washing operation is simpler.\nThe alternative of an ascending flow in layers is recommended for water with less than 50 UT turbidity with short peaks. On the other hand, the series pre- filter is better for poor quality water as it has a better capacity for storing solids (AARAUV 1985).\nThere are two alternatives for achieving a uniform flow in the pre-filtration units:\nStructure with rectangular tanks equipped with manual sluice valves to isolate the units. Although a small investment is required, this is the most comfortable solution for the operator and the most reliable in the long term.\nWater measuring devices at the entrance of each unit and the subsequent regulation of the intake valve. No additional investment required.\nGravel pre-filter in layers, with an ascending flow\nDescription\nThe intake pipe goes through the centre of the pre-filter to the bottom of the unit. From this pipe, the water is distributed evenly throughout the unit by means of secondary porous pipes. The filtration zone consists of four layers of gravel of different sizes, with the thickest gravel forming the bottom layer and the finest gravel the top layer.\nThe water goes through the filtration zone in an ascending manner and is collected by the outlet pipe which has 12.7mm diameter holes at 50mm from the centre and 0.40m from the gravel filtration bed. This pipe can be larger than the intake pipe to reduce the head loss and ease the outgoing flow.\nThe drainage zone is at the bottom of the pre-filter. The floor of the unit has a 12.5% incline to ease the discharge of sediment to the cleaning water discharge channel. Slabs or bricks are placed on the discharge channel to support the gravel, at intervals of two or three centimetres (CRHEA 1991; Marr\u00f3n 1998).\nDesign criteria\nThe filtration speed is selected depending on the quality of the water: It increases in accordance with the quality at a rate of 1 to 1.5 m/h.\nThe speed ratio in the secondary and main pipes that distribute the water in the bottom of the unit should be Vp/Vs < 0.462 for an even distribution. The diameter of the secondary pipes is thus obtained.\nThe loss of volume in the bed during the normal pre-filtration operation is approximately 20cm.\nThe pre-filtration-filtration system has a limited capacity for assimilating sudden differences in the quality of raw water.\nOther gravel pre-filtration models with ascending flow layers\nSeries vertical flow gravel pre-filtration\nHorizontal flow gravel pre-filtration\nFILTRATION\nSlow modified filter with filter-harrowing cleaning\nThe slow sand filter proposed below differs from the conventional variable head slow filter in the following aspects:\nIts water inlet and outlet structures are simpler than those of conventional filters, without altering their function.\nConsidering that the main biological activity in the sand bed occurs in the first layers and that the high temperature in the Amazon region is favorable for this activity, it is suggested that the height of the bed should be 35cm so that 95% of the coliforms can be removed.\nThe ascending flow filter-harrowing cleaning method is applied, as shown on page 22.\nWith the above-mentioned modifications, the direct cost of building the filters is reduced by approximately 40% (the structures are simplified and the height of the filter box is reduced)), in addition to making its operation easier.\nThe selection of sand for the filtration bed is a critical point, as the need to transport the selected sand from distant places raises the costs significantly; this could represent 30% of the direct construction costs of the filters. Technical literature is very demanding regarding the characteristics of the sand. With a simple method, however, locally-available sand can be sifted and cleaned to obtain an adequate filtration bed without affecting the effectiveness of the filter (see the Operation and Maintenance chapter).\nDescription\nDuring a normal filtration operation, the water enters through the top part of the filter to the supernatant layer. The inlet pipe has two holes to release the possible accumulation of air at the top of the inlet pipe. The water will remain in the supernatant layer for several hours, during which time the suspended particles will settle.\nThe obstruction of the filter will cause the supernatant layer to rise to the brim, at which time it will be necessary to clean the sand bed. There must be 20cm of free space above the brim.\nThe greatest biological activity takes place on the surface layer of sand, where the majority of pathogenic organisms in the water are removed. The bed must be between 30 and 40cm high, depending on the quality of the gross volume of water. The inner walls of the filter box in the section containing the filtration bed must have a rough finish to prevent the formation of short-circuits.\nThe sand must go through a sifting process to eliminate grains that are too thick or too fine. Both the gravel and the sand must then be washed before being placed in the filter, in order to eliminate organic matter and clay (see Operation and Maintenance chapter).\nThe water goes through the filtration sand bed to the drainage system underneath, which is comprised of porous pipes leading to the next unit. Layers of gravel are placed on top of the porous pipes at the bottom to support the sand.\nOutside the filter, the outlet pipe has a 10-20cm tee pipe above the sand bed to prevent any accidental discharge from the filter which could affect the layer of micro organisms and avoid the formation of negative pressures during the operation. This pipe serves the same purpose as the device that controls the minimum level in conventional filters.\nIn the cleaning canal, the filter-harrowing method is used, collecting the water that drags dirt from the bed during the raking process.\nDesign criteria\nThe smaller the effective diameter of the sand, the more efficiently will bacteria be removed in the filter; however, the cleaning frequency will also increase. For clear water with a high bacteriological content, small effective diameters will be selected, whereas large effective diameters will be chosen for cloudy water.\nFor water with a high bacteriological content, low filtration velocities are recommended, and a 0.4m-thick bed.\nDrainage pipes consist of a main drain and porous side drains with 12.7mm diameter holes at intervals of 50mm on the bottom, through\nwhich the treated water will enter. The space between the side drains should be equivalent to 1/16 of the total length of the side drains and 1/32 of the total length of the wall.\nThe sizing of the pipes should be based on the criteria that the speed limit at any point in the pipes should not exceed 0.30 m/s. The list of velocities between the main drain (VD) and the secondary drains (Vd) should be VD/ Vd < 0.462 to obtain an even distribution.\nA maximum height of 3m from the outlet of the pre-filters to the base of the filter should be considered, so that the water flowing from the pre- filters can be used for flow or counter-flow filter cleaning. This height prevents the loss of head generated by silting in the filters, allowing the water to flow normally during the cleaning process.\nDISINFECTION\u00a0: small-scale drip chlorinator\nDescription\nOriginal solution tank This consists of a small concrete tank on top of the reservoir, placed near the water inlet and next to the tank cover. The inner walls and floor of the chlorinator must be lined with a 2cm layer of cement with a sealer to prevent leaks. It is important that there should be no leakage \u2013 particularly through the floor \u2013 because the chlorine could deteriorate the structure of the reservoir. The floor should be slightly sloping towards the cleaning pipe. The tank should have a maximum storage capacity sufficient for seven days.\nSmall-scale chlorinator lid The cover over both the chlorinator and the reservoir should have a padlock to prevent strangers from handling them. They should always be in place in order to prevent the chlorine from evaporating. Chlorine can still evaporate through the grooves between the cover and the walls of the chlorinator, however. To prevent this, a rubber inner tube should be nailed to the edges of the tank so that it is hermetically sealed.\nDrip installation This consists of a \u00bd\u201d pipe and a \u00bd\u201d plastic tap placed 3cm above the floor of the chlorinator. The tap is useful for controlling the drip. The drip control system consists of a floater and a pipe with a hole through which the flow \u2013 and therefore the drip \u2013 can be constant.\nCleaning pipe This is a \u00bd\u201d plastic pipe which is level with the floor of the chlorinator. It has a plug at the outlet point which can be opened when the chlorinator requires cleaning. (Marr\u00f3n, 1998b).\nOPERATION AND MAINTENANCE\nA flow-measuring device should be installed at the entrance to the treatment plant, as well as a corresponding inlet valve to regulate the operating flow in the plant.\nBelow is a valve scheme for the conveyance of treated water. The bypass valves (B) enable the plant to continue operating even when a unit is out of service.\nFor the flow-measuring device, a triangular weir and two rectangular weirs are recommended, as shown in the figure.\nIn order to regulate the flow, the IP inlet valve is switched on until the water in the triangular weir reaches the paint mark, which indicates the plant\u2019s operating flow. The rectangular weirs serve to make sure that the water enters the two sediment tanks evenly. Two simple wooden sluice gates serve the purpose of the IS1 and IS2 valves, shutting off water flow into a sediment tank during maintenance.\nPRE-FILTER IN ASCENDING FLOW LAYERS\nPre-filters serve to eliminate impurities that cloud the water. If impurities enter the filter directly they will obstruct it: frequent cleansing is therefore necessary.\nDirty water enters through the lower part and rises through the gravel filtration bed, which itself retains algae, a good percentage of bacteria, and all suspended matter larger than 10mm in diameter. Then the upper pipes collect the water to convey it to the next treatment unit.\nOperation of the pre-filter in ascending flow layers\nStart-up To fill the pre-filter, shut off the drainage valve and slightly open the inlet valve so that a moderate flow does not drag the solids accumulated on the bed. This flow can be increased gradually as filling progresses.\nNormal pre-filtering operation During the pre-filtration operation the inlet and outlet valves should be open. The drainage valve should remain shut. When necessary, remove algae and floating elements.\nHydraulic cleaning The discharge descending from the pre-filter will drag the particles that settled in the gravel during normal operation. For thorough cleaning it is important to completely empty the pre-filter. The operation should be repeated two or three times until the water is clean.\nThe pre-filter should not remain empty for too long, because adhered material will be compacted, making the subsequent hydraulic cleaning process less effective.\nIn order to prevent accumulated mud from compacting (and to reduce the regularity of manually cleaning the gravel), hydraulic cleaning should take place approximately once a week during the rainy season (high turbidity) or every two months during a dry season (low turbidity).\nThe following steps should be followed:\n1) Shut the inlet valve and open the drainage valve 2) Wait until the unit is completely empty 3) Fill the unit again, as indicated in the start-up chapter, ie. with a moderate flow. 4) If the cleaning water is cloudy, repeat the operation.\nManual cleaning\nThere comes a time when, after successive hydraulic cleaning processes, not all the material accumulated in the filtration bed is eliminated because it is stuck to the gravel walls. In this case the pre- filter should be cleaned manually. As a reference, this should be done at least once a year after the rainy season.\nFirst of all, remove the water from the inlet pipe. Extract the top layer and wash it in a water container. The best procedure for washing gravel is to stir it mechanically in a container so that the friction loosens the solids that are stuck to the gravel surface. A cylinder could be used, as shown in the figure. The gravel is then scraped with the help of a stick whilst the clean water is entering the cylinder through a hose. The water with the impurities from the gravel will go out through another hose placed further up in the cylinder.\nThe same procedure is followed for the next layer, trying not to mix the gravel of the different layers. If for any reason they do mix, they should be sifted again to separate them.\nThe pre-filter must contain water in order to prevent the filtered material from compacting the unwashed gravel onto the wall in the pre-filter.\nOnce the pre-filter is empty, the walls must be brushed down and the layers replaced on the bottom.\nThe gravel should be replenished carefully in layers of corresponding size. This should be done immediately after this cleaning process, in order to avoid possible contamination.\nMaintenance of pre-filters\nCut down weeds, shrubs and trees around the pre-filters.\nProtect the soil against erosion.\nRepair cracks in the structure walls.\nCheck all the valves and grease them if necessary.\nExtract floating elements from the water.\nSLOW SAND FILTERS\nThe main characteristic of slow filtration is that it eliminates bacteria and viruses in the water. It is a very effective mechanism because it simulates the natural purification process that occurs when rain water goes through the crust of the earth down to subterranean rivers.\nA thin, jelly-like film forms on the surface of the sand, digesting and eliminating impurities in the water. Once the water has gone through this layer it seeps into the sand bed, where the main part of the purifying treatment takes place, and where pure water is obtained.\nDuring the filtration process, impurities come into contact with - and are trapped by - the grains of sand on the surface. The impurities then go through a chemical and biological degradation process to become simpler, more inoffensive forms that dissolve or remain on the sand bed as inert matter until the filter is cleaned.\nOther advantages of slow filtration: 1) no chemical substances need be applied, 2) the system can be managed by a fairly unskilled operator on a regular basis.\nOperation of the slow sand filter with filter-harrowing cleaning\nPreparing the sand bed\nIt is important to eliminate the finest and thickest grains of sand. This will maintain good porosity in the bed without affecting the successful elimination of bacteria and viruses. The sand must be free of any clay or organic matter.\nTo prepare the sand it must be sifted as follows: place the fixed sifter at a 45% angle. With a spade, forcefully throw the sand at it. The sand should be completely dry during this task. (C\u00e1nepa 1988).\nThe steps are as follows:\n1)Sift the sand through a sifter with 2.54cm (1\u201d) holes to eliminate pieces of wood, stones, etc. 2)Sift the sand through a sifter with 1.588cm (5/8\u201d) holes to retain thick sand. 3)Sift the sand through a 0.635cm. (1/4\u201d) and 0.317cm. (1/8\u201d) sifter to eliminate sand that is too fine. 4)Wash the sand to remove the clay and organic matter adhered to the grains of sand, following the same procedure as for washing gravel. A total of eight people are required for the sifting operation.\nStart-up\nThe idea is to fill the two filters with an ascending flow, in order to avoid the accumulation of air bubbles.\n1) Check the filter valves to make sure they are shut 2) Fill the first filter through the top opening both the inlet valve (F1) and the outlet valve (SF1). 3) Whilst the first filter is filling up, close the inlet valve of the reservoir (IR) and open the outlet valve of the second filter (SF2) so that the water treated in the first filter enters through the bottom of the second filter. Filling the second filter with an ascending flow eliminates the air bubbles accumulated in the sand bed. 4) When the water in the second filter reaches a level of 10cm above the sand bed, open the inlet valve (IF2) and close the inlet valve of the first filter (IF1). 5) Open the cleaning valve at the bottom of the first filter which was filled through the top, in order to drain it completely. 6) When the first filter is empty, close the drainage valve and let the water treated in the second filter enter the first filter though the bottom, filling it up to between 10 and 20cm above the sand bed. 7) Open the inlet valve to the first filter (IF1) and the inlet valve to the reservoir for the normal filtration process.\nNormal filtration operation\nDuring the filtering operation the inlet and outlet valves must be open, whereas the valves for cleaning the bottom and the filtration bed should remain shut.\nWhen necessary, algae and floating elements should be removed.\nThe incoming flow must be measured by unscrewing the universal union of the descending pipe through which the water enters, whilst at the same time filling a bucket with a specific capacity. If the flow entering the filtration units is different, the inlet valves must be regulated so that the incoming flow is the same.\nCleaning the filtration bed\nIf the water level in the filter rises to the brim, it means that the sand bed is obstructed and needs to be cleaned (Canepa 1988; Marr\u00f3n 1998a).\nTwo cleaning methods can be applied, depending on the duration of the preceding filtration flow.\nDry filter-harrowing cleaning method: Applied when the previous run has lasted more than a month. It consists of de-compacting the sand and redistributing the filtered material to regenerate the porosity of the sand bed. (Pardon et al, 1983). These steps should be followed:\n1) Close the water inlet and let the water filter at a declining rate throughout the night.\n2) The next day, remove floating matter and open the bottom cleaning valve until the water reaches 15cm below the surface of the sand.\n3) De-compact the 15cm deep sand bed with a pick, then rake the sand to loosen it and make it more spongy.\n4) Open the filter inlet valve.\nWhilst the filter-harrowing method is being applied in a dry filter, care must be taken to ensure that only the corresponding quantity of water enters the filter that is still in operation. To this end, close the filter inlet valve until the correct operating flow is obtained. In this way the surplus water in the pre-filters will overflow away. This operation must take place every time one of the two filters is out of service.\nThis is applied when the previous run has lasted less than a month. It consists of making the water flow against the current (ascending) whilst the sand bed is raked until the cleaning water is less cloudy. The cleaning water will drag the dirt and other matter raked up from the sand. Then the same method applied for the dry filter-harrowing method should be applied. The steps to be followed for cleaning the first filter are:\n1) Close the water inlet and let the water filter at a declining rate throughout the night.\n2) The next day, remove the floating matter and open valve to clean the filtration bed. Shut the inlet valves to both filters, the outlet valve (SF2) of the filter that will not be cleaned and the inlet valve to the reservoir (R). Open the filter by-pass valves (BF) so that the effluent from the pre-filters enters through the bottom of the filter to be cleaned \u2013 ie. through the filtered water outlet pipe (see sketch).\n3) Rake the entire depth of the sand bed (30 to 40cm) whilst the water flows against the current until it is clearer, taking care not to rake the layer supporting the gravel below the sand. Rake 15 - 20cm of the whole filter surface by rows; then remove the raked sand from the surface of half the filter to the other half, as shown in the drawing, and rake the remaining 15 to 20cms. Replace the sand and then repeat the operation on the other half of the sand bed. Try and prevent the cleaning water from overflowing and losing sand. This operation can take about two hours and two people are needed to take turns raking the sand.\n4)Close the water outlet (SF 1) and the cleaning valve of the filtration bed in the filter undergoing cleaning (filter 1). Open the inlet valve to the reservoir (IR) and the inlet (IF2 and outlet (SF2) valves of filter 2, putting it into normal operating mode.\n5) Next, apply the dry filter-harrowing method to filter 1.\nComplete filter cleaning\nThis operation takes place every five years.\n1) Remove the sand and the gravel, without mixing the gravel from the different layers.\n2) Wash the filter layer and the drainage pipes with a brush and water and replace them if they are deteriorated.\n3)Wash the sand and the gravel\n4)Put the clean gravel and sand back in place. Replace any lost sand or gravel.\nMaintenance of the filters\nCut back weeds, shrubs and trees around the filters.\nProtect the soil against erosion.\nRepair cracks in the walls of the structure.\nExamine the valves and grease them if necessary.\nRemove floating elements from the water layer.\nMonitor the growth of algae. If there is excessive growth the filters must be covered.\nMonitor the flow entering the filters.\nMonitor the smell and flavour of the water.\nKeep a record of the turbidity at the entrance to the filters and note the length of the filtration process.\nSMALL-SCALE DRIP CHLORINATOR\nWater of a very good quality is produced by slow sand filtration. Nevertheless, chlorination is essential for complete disinfection purposes, and to avoid future contamination of the water while it is being transported and handled. A chlorine and water solution is prepared in the chlorinator and then allowed to drip into the reservoir to disinfect the water. The drip is controlled with a tap.\nOperation and maintenance of the chlorinator\nGauging the flow, calculating the drip and preparing the mother solution\nThe following operations are only necessary when the chlorinator starts operating and when the quantity of water entering the reservoir varies, for example during a change of season. (Marr\u00f3n, 1998b). An appraisal must be made to calculate the flow entering the reservoir. Once the flow has been calculated, the quantity of chlorine required, the volume of the mother solution to be prepared and the drops per minute required to disinfect the water can be obtained using the following table.\nAfter using the above table to calculate the quantity of chlorine, place it in a bucket with enough water to dissolve it, then pour this mixture into the chlorinator and add sufficient water to complete the litres of mother solution recommended by the table. The mother solution (concentration: 5000 ppm) is the mixture of chlorine and water poured into the drip chlorinator to disinfect the water in the reservoir. The tap must then be regulated to provide the approximate number of drops per minute indicated in the table. Count the drops per minute and if the chlorinator provides five drops more or less than indicated in the table, it can be considered correct.\nThe chlorine considered in this table is powdered HTH at 65%. If chlorine of another percentage is used, then the necessary weight can be calculated with the following operation (only the second column of the table will vary).\nCalibration of the small-scale chlorinator: regulating the drip\nNormal type of water is considered for the previous data. However, some physical and chemical aspects of the water could alter the chlorination. Consequently, the drip must always be regulated when putting the chlorinator into operation.\nMeasuring the residual chlorine in the tanks furthest away from the network will demonstrate whether the drip obtained in the table is correct.\nIf the necessary amount of residual chlorine is not found (0.2 ppm \u2013 1.0 ppm), the tap must be regulated to increase the drip. Never increase the dose to more than three times the amount calculated in the table.\nOperation of the small-scale chlorinator\nThe mother solution must be removed every two days \u2013 because the chlorine tends to settle at the bottom of the chlorinator \u2013 and the number of drips must be controlled to make sure they are adequate, otherwise the tap will need to be regulated.\nThe drip control system, comprised of a flexible polyethylene pipe with a hole and a floater, provides a constant drip. This system must be checked to make sure it is in good condition.\nIf for any reason the water stops flowing into the reservoir, the tap dripping the chlorine solution must be closed immediately. The chlorine loses its disinfecting power as the days go by, therefore the mother solution must not remain in the chlorinator for more than seven days.\nCleaning the chlorinator\nEvery time a new mother solution is prepared, the chlorinator must be cleaned to remove previous particles and the remaining solution. To this end, remove the stopper of the cleaning pipe and rinse with water.\nOPERATION AND MAINTENANCE TRAINING\nA TRAINERS\u2019 GUIDE\nTraining is geared towards changing behaviour. It is therefore an agent of change and ensures the sustainability of water treatment systems.\nKnowledge of water treatment procedures and manual operation and maintenance skills will not give rise to a change in behaviour unless they are accompanied by a motivation process and the creation of an appropriate environment among the community and the people in charge of the operation.\nAnalysis of the situation\nIt is necessary to analyse the situation in the community and its levels of organisation.\nEvaluation of training requirements\nBased on an analysis of the tasks to be performed by the operators, a decision must be made regarding how many of them will be trained and the type and level of training they will receive.\nThe tasks required must be compared with the knowledge and skills of available operators. The training courses must bridge these gaps.\nDesign of the training programme\nThe programme will be designed based on previous studies, defining the contents, methodology, materials and the level of knowledge and skills to be acquired (see the example of a training programme).\nImplementation of the training programme\nIf I hear: I forget, If I see: I remember, If I do: I understand. (Old Chinese proverb)\nLearning tends to be an imitation process, therefore it is necessary for the trainer to provide proper examples to be followed. This process must be reinforced with practical work to make sure that the operators understand properly, otherwise they should be corrected.\nParticipatory methods whereby operators communicate with each other and learn by doing are always much more effective than simple lectures.\nFirst of all, the trainer must provide a general vision of all the tasks and procedures required for the operation of a water treatment plant. Then the information on each task must be presented and assimilated as part of a logical sequence. The steps below should be followed for each task:\n1) Knowledge must be transmitted through talks, photographs, drawings, questions and discussions (no more than 30 minutes)\n2) Demonstration of a practical example.\n3)Practical work. This step builds up the operators\u2019 confidence in the tasks and should continue until they demonstrate that they are capable of carrying out the task properly.\nCharacteristics of the trainer A trainer is a learning facilitator who gives participants the opportunity to learn through experience, thus building up their confidence.\nIt must be remembered that people learn individually, therefore the trainer must:\nshow a sincere interest in each individual\nprovide encouragement and support\nmake sure that he is understood by everyone\nEvaluation of the training course\nThe evaluation consists of obtaining information on the learning progress, in terms of feedback about the knowledge acquired, and the success of the practical work. Evaluation provides useful information to the operators about progress made, and is a source of information for subsequent training sessions.\nImpact evaluation\nThis consists of obtaining information regarding the application of the knowledge acquired (IRC 1983; Waterlines 1997).\nExample of a training programme on slow sand filtration\nProgramme of theoretical courses\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nALLEN, R.B.

Each stage is common to all Wellness Filter\u00ae products and is designed with ultimate aim to produce water that is 'better than bottled water quality' with every drop.\nStage 1 - Purification\nPre-Filtration\nThe first step is to remove common contaminants greater than 1 micron in size and which can be found in municipal water. This includes;\nDirt, rust, sediment\nCysts such as Giardia and Cryptoosporidium\nNano-Filtration\nThe second step is to remove contaminants below the 1 micron level. At this level these are usually biological contaminants such as;\nBacteria\nE.Coli\nViruses\nTo achieve this Wellness is one of the world's first water filter companies to use and recommend NanoCeram\u00ae - Nano- filtration technology. NanoCeram\ntechnology removes all of these water borne threats down to an incredible 0.02 microns. This is more than 100 times greater than most drinking water filters and is small enough to trap even Viruses, should they ever make their way into our water supply.\nChemical Filtration\nThe final step in the purification process is to cleanse water of unwanted chemicals and other impurities. To achieve this Wellness uses two key media.\nKDF 55 & 85\nKDF\u00ae is a high-purity, granulated copper and zinc- based alloy that treats water based on the principle of REDOX (Oxidation-Reduction). KDF's induces an electro-chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred between molecules changing many harmful contaminants into harmless components.\nFor instance; chlorine is transformed into chloride (salt) while heavy metals such as Copper, Lead and Mercury react and are more easily captured by the following carbon stage.\nKDF enhances filtration performance by;\nControlling or eliminated micro-organisms\nExtending carbon life & reducing maintenance\nReducing many chemical and heavy metal contaminants\nKDF's REDOX activity also creates an environment that is deadly to micro-organisms by interfering with their ability to function.\nCarbon\nCarbon, the world's oldest filtration material, is perfect for removing chlorine, chloramines, organic chemical compounds, odours and also improves taste.\nBoth Organic Coconut and Activated carbon are used to protect against a wide range of chemicals reducing them to typically non-detectable levels. Wellness grade Carbon removes;\nChlorine, Chloramines and Tri-halomethanes\nOther chemicals known to increase the risk of cancer\nHeavy Metal Filtration\nThese three process combined also work in concert to reduce harmful heavy metails including;\nCopper\nLead\nWhile harmful contaminants are removed our filtration process is specifically designed to retain healthy acid buffering minerals such as calcium, magnesium and potassium.\nThese minerals are always found in natural springs and are a must for truly healthy water. Water devoid of minerals has been shown to be not healthy and it is one of the key reasons why Wellness does not recommend drinking water from a distiller, Reverse Osmosis system or rain water.\nStage 2 - 'Wetter Water'\nThe next critical phase in the Wellness process is 'activation', and in many respects it is the most critical phase in creating healthier water.\nMagnetite\nDuring our research we found that several of the world\u2019s great springs have Magnetite, a iron-rich volcanic mineral, present in the surrounding geology.\nThis presence convinced us that the magnetic field generated by this mineral, due to its high iron content, has an important role to play in creating healthier water. Why?\nWater is a dynamic arrangement of constantly dancing H20 molecules that 'change places' with each other every 1/10 millionth of a second. As water passes over a magnetic field waters hydrogen bonds are re- arranged in such a manner that makes them behave very differently from ordinary water.\nThe network of H20 molecules becomes more ordered and structured. This in turn makes the water 'wetter' and more hydrating. Drinking a 'wetter water' can have important positive effects on health.\nHowever, the fields of magnetite found at these natural springs were often hundreds of feet deep and miles wide. There was no way we could put enough magnetite into a water filter in order to achieve the effect we were looking for.\nA breakthrough was needed...\n\u2018Magnetic Resonance Activation\u2019\nDuring research we discovered that by placing specially arranged ceramic magnets within the bed of magnetite created exactly the magnetic field strength we were looking for.\nCritically, we also found that the strength and alignment of each magnet had to be absolutely precise. Too much energy or an incorrectly aligned field produced an inferior water.\nAs the water passed through this magnetic bed it dramatically increased the solubility of the water, creating a naturally \u2018wetter\u2019 water that was ideal for optimal cellular hydration.\nWhile creating 'wetter' water was one of our key goals we passionately wanted to create the healthiest water possible. So our research continued...\nNatural Ionisation - SGES Tenko- Seki\u2122\nWe discovered something else during our years of research - `SGES Tenko-Seki'. Tenko- Seki is an extremely rare volcanic mineral with very special far-infrad properties.\nSuper Growth Emitting Stone Tenko-Seki emits high frequency far infrared rays at a very specific wavelength. Far-infrared rays are known for their very powerful healing and detoxifying effect on living things.These infra-red ray can;\nAcclerate the growth of plants\nReduce the clustering size of water - making it even 'wetter'\nInduce the formation of natural negative ions - Nature's own antioxidant\nToday, thousands of healthcare professionals use infrared to help detoxify cells and accelerate healing.\nBut who would have thought it could be applied to WATER?\nDr. Serge Jurasunus, a famous Portuguese complementary health specialist, tested Tenko-Seki and had this to say;\n\"Tenko-Seki far infrared rays shorten the cluster chain of water... increases specific gravity and hence water adherence to cell surfaces...

In general, tap water is not a good idea. The dissolved solids that are in tap water - namely sodium, calcium, alkaline salts, sulfur, chlorine and magnesium - are detrimental to the health of your Dionaea. Although it may not be immediately apparent with a few waterings, over time, the dissolved solids will begin to build up in the soil and can lead to a sickly looking plant and eventually death of the plant.\nVenus Fly Traps and all other carnivorous plants should only be watered with distilled water, rain water, reverse osmosis water (from an RO system). However regarding tap or well water, if one measures the water with a TDS (total dissolved solids) meter which indicates a TDS measurement of less than 50 ppm (parts per million), it is safe to use for Venus Flytraps and other carnivorous plants. Although higher levels of TDS can be tolerated (up to 100 ppm (parts per million)) or so, in that case the growing medium would need to be flushed occasionally by watering several times over a period of several hours or perhaps a day, and the plants may benefit from repotting (changing the growing medium) once per year or so.\nDuring their active growing season , Venus Flytraps should be monitored, especially during hot and dry weather, to ensure that their growing medium does not dry out completely. The growing medium ideally should be just moist, not soggy or waterlogged. Therefore the tray method (described and pictured below) is best used only while the plants are in direct sunlight in hot weather, or when one goes on vacation to ensure that the medium does not dry completely. Otherwise, if the plant and growing medium can be monitored, it is best to water and then allow the medium to dry until just moist before watering again. It is especially important during their dormancy to avoid wet conditions when it is very cool or cold at the same time. Because the plants should be kept cool for much of the time during their dormancy, it is best to allow the growing medium to become almost dry before watering again. Sometimes this means watering only 2-3 times per month during the growing season, depending on weather, humidity and the size of the pot the plant is growing in (larger pots often retain water for a longer period). So keeping the plant and medium \"moist, not wet\" most of the time is a good general rule, and it should be less moist most of the time during its dormancy when the air is cool to cold.\nOne way to water a Venus Flytrap is the tray method. Below you will see a photo of the tray method which involves setting a pot with drainage holes in the bottom of it in a tray of distilled or other pure water. Most media (soil) that Venus Fly Traps are potted in is very good at retaining water. The media will soak up water from a tray or bowl almost like a sponge.The tray method works well when plants are actively growing, are in lots of direct sunlight, and the weather is warm, or during vacations when one is not able to check one's plants. However, the tray method is often not a good method to use all the time (see the paragraph above).\n"}, {"score": 1380.612, "uuid": "a3812bac-e8d4-5529-9df6-e622bb3ec3e7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0303wb-06-10255", "target_hostname": "www.taupodc.govt.nz", "target_uri": "http://www.taupodc.govt.nz/A-to-Z-of-council-services/Water--Wastewater/Water-Conservation/", "page_rank": 1.7645635e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Water</em> Conservation ~ Taupo District Council", "snippet": "When the <em>rain</em> comes the transformation from brown to green will be dramatic. * Aerate the soil to allow <em>water</em> to be absorbed more easily. * Do not mow to a height of less <em>than</em> 2cm.

New drinking water standards \"Drinking-water Standards for New Zealand 2005\" were recently adopted, and compliance with this standard is\u00a0obligatory\u00a0following the adoption of the new Public Health Bill \u00a0in 2008.\nTo comply with the new Drinking Water Standards it will be necessary to build a new water treatment plant, and because of the additional treatment processes involved treatment costs will rise.\nAll of the water used in the home, for example, clothes and dish washing, baths and showers, toilet flushing, leaking taps and toilet cisterns, is discharged to the sewer for treatment and disposal at the waste water treatment plant. Reducing the amount of water used in the home can reduce the cost of waste water treatment and could delay the increase of the waste water treatment plant capacity.\nBeing sensible with use of water in the garden and lawn is important as they are the biggest drain of these resources during hot weather when they are needed most.\nLawns\nA lawn can use more water per square metre than any other area in your garden.\nWater your lawn only when it needs it. A good way to test this is to step on the grass. If it springs back up when you move it doesn't need watering. If it stays flat it needs watering.\nDeep soak your lawn. While giving the lawn a quick drink every night may be good therapy for you, it makes the grass shallow rooted and dependent on the meagre amount of water that you provide. Water a maximum of twice a week, but for a longer period. This enables the\u00a0grass to become more\u00a0deeply rooted\u00a0 seeking out any moisture,\u00a0in turn making the grass hardier.\nReduce the lawn area. This has the additional benefit of reducing your mowing.\nCheck your local nursery for a suitable drought tolerant lawn grass for your area.\nLet the lawn go brown during very dry times. When the rain comes the transformation from brown to green will be dramatic.\nGive the lawn a feed but do not over fertilise.\nAerate the soil to allow water to be absorbed more easily.\nDo not mow to a height of less than 2cm. Taller grass holds water better.\nUse a timer with your sprinkler. A forgotten sprinkler wastes more than a 1000 litres per hour. A timer will allow you to use as much water as is needed without the threat of wastage.\nThe Garden\nUse a good mulch. Mulches can prevent up to 73 per cent evaporation loss. Mulches can prevent excessive runoff, restrict weed growth, improve soil structure and help put valuable nutrients back into the soil.\nGroup plants according to how much water they require. By grouping plants by water usage you can avoid waste on plants that don't need a lot of water.\nToughen up the plants. Too many plants are pampered to the point where they are so dependent on water that they do not go out of their way to find any water themselves. Wait until the soil dries out before watering and use a plant such as bamboo as an indicator. When the leaves start to droop, then water.\nWater the highest parts of the garden first. This ensures that any runoff water soaks into lower dry areas rather than being wasted.\nRemove weeds. Weeds compete for water and nutrients.\nDig a small trench around the trees. This will give the water a chance to soak in and reduces water lost as runoff.\nWater your pot plants by dunking them in a bucket of water. Wait a few seconds, when the bubbles disappear, do the next pot. This saves water and ensures pot plants get a thorough drink.\nWater during cooler parts of the day.\nAvoid watering on windy days.\nWater the roots not the leaves. If you water the leaves water is lost through evaporation, and any chlorine in the water could damage the leaves.\nDon't water the road or pathways. Position your sprinklers so water lands on the lawn or garden, not\u00a0paved areas.\nPlant drought resistant native trees and plants. Many natives are both attractive and suited to gardens, and thrive with far less watering than do other species.\nWater wisely to avoid runoff. Soil and dissolved nutrients are carried away with runoff, which increases the need for expensive fertiliser and can pollute nearby streams.\nUse a trigger hose. This allows you to be in control and water is not wasted when moving the hose around. Always remember to turn the tap off when finished in case the pressure build-up causes the nozzle to pop off.\nThe Yard\nDiscourage games with the hose and sprinklers. Squirting water around can waste up to 1000 litres per hour.\nUse a broom not a hose to clean driveways and footpaths. Cleaning a path with a broom is quicker and more efficient than using a hose, which can waste up to 1000 litres per hour.\nEvery home should have a compost bin. Compost improves the structure of your soil. This increases the moisture holding capacity of sandy soils and allows better penetration of water into heavy clay soils.\nSwimming Pool\nCover your pool to reduce evaporation, retain warmth and keep out leaves and dirt. Up to 200 litres of water per day can be lost because of evaporation from a typical ground pool.\nAccept some fluctuation in pool level due to evaporation and rainfall. They will often compensate for each other, meaning topping up with the hose can be avoided.\nCheck the pool for leaks\nWashing the Car, Boat or Caravan\nUse a bucket and sponge to wash the car, boat or caravan. Use the hose only for rinsing and turn it off between rinses.\nWash the car, boat or caravan on the lawn instead of on the driveway.\nInside the House\nThe Bathroom\nInstall a dual flush toilet. Modern toilets give the option to flush either half or all the cistern's water. Traditional toilets can usually be converted to dual flush.\nTake shorter showers. Limit showers to the time it takes to soap up, wash down, and rinse off. Remember that shorter showers also save on hot water costs.\nInstall a water-saving shower rose. Many showers put out 20 litres of water per minute, however, 10 litres is enough for a refreshing, cleansing shower.\nThere is no need to run water down the plughole while brushing your teeth. Just wet your brush and fill a glass for rinsing.\nDon't rinse your razor under a running tap. Fill the sink with a little warm water for rinsing. This is just as effective as running water and far less wasteful.\nIn the Laundry\nMake sure the washing machine's load adjustment is right for the load. If there's no load adjustment, wait until you have enough clothes for a full load. Washing machines use 100 - 200 litres of water per load.\nFront loading machines are generally more efficient than top loaders and save water and power. Also use the sud-saver option when several loads have to be washed.\nIn the Kitchen\nWhen washing dishes by hand, don't rinse them under a running tap. If you have two sinks, fill the second one with rinsing water. If you have only one sink, stack washed dishes in a dish rack and rinse them with a pan of hot water.\nDon't run the automatic dishwasher until you have a full load.\nDon't let the tap run when cleaning vegetables. Just rinse them in a plugged sink or a pan of clean water.\nKeep a bottle of drinking water in the refrigerator. Running the tap until the water is cool enough to drink is wasteful. Aerating taps are inexpensive and can reduce water flow by 50 per cent.\nWhen cooking, use only a little water in the saucepan and keep the lid on.\nGarbage disposal units use about 30 litres of water per day and send a lot of extra rubbish into the sewers. This places an additional load on the sewage treatment plants. Perhaps some of your food scraps could be used in the garden.\nWhen buying a new appliance that uses water, be sure it has a high water conservation rating.\nHot Water Pipes and Systems\nInsulate hot water pipes. This avoids wasting water while waiting for hot water to flow through and saves power.\nMake sure your hot water system thermostat is not set too high. Adding cold water to cool too hot water is wasteful.\nIf you have a spa, ensure it is well insulated to keep water warm for longer. Reheating the water during the reticulation/spa process reduces water wastage.\nNo Leaks\nIf you have a water meter, turn all taps off before you go to bed one night and take a meter reading. Check the meter the next morning before any water is used. If the meter reading has advanced, and no-one used any water during the night, you may have a leaking pipe, tap or toilet cistern. Locate the problem and repair it.\nA slow drip from a tap can waste more than 200 litres of water per day. Turn taps off properly and check washers for wear.\nA continuously running toilet can waste more than 16,000 litres of water per year. To check for leaks put a little food colouring in the tank.

Ever had the unpleasant feeling of a tight chest or feel the need to cough? That steam we dig so much is the vaporized water coming out of the shower faucet, which\u2014when unfiltered\u2014contains all that vicious chlorine. That vaporized water invades your lungs and pollutes your body with even more unhealthy toxins. As much as we may love the idea of a relaxing, hot and steamy shower, the idea of standing in a small room with toxic steam makes the idea somewhat, shall we say, less appealing.\nShopping for a Shower Filter\nFor the best and most effective results, you should look for a filter that employs carbon, which filters out synthetic chemicals, THMs and VOCs. Also look for a filter to have a KDF stage of filtration, to reduce the amount of chlorine and balance the water\u2019s Ph (for that healthy glow).\n5 Ways to Determine if You Need to Worry about Tap Water Contamination\nFriday, December 3rd, 2010\nCategories: Aquasana Water Filters , Carbon Filter , Contaminants in Drinking Water , Environment , faucet water filters , Methods of Filtration , Shower Filters\nYou may have heard the reports of the 60,000 chemicals from our industries that sometimes make their way into our drinking water supplies; the press keeps us abreast on what contaminants affect your water. You\u2019ve no doubt heard all the dramatic warnings concerning the dangers of heavy metals, chlorine, bacteria, viruses, pesticides, volatile organic compounds, cow pee and fairy dust. Depending on the amount of unfiltered tap water you consume and the specific contaminants, you and your family\u2019s health may be at risk.\nContaminants everywhere\nThe Gulf Oil Spill. Lead and giardiasis in city water. Water boiling warnings. You\u2019ve seen this stuff all over the news, especially when the media run stories on local water supplies showing that this or that contaminant has been found. In these circumstances, your concern is probably justified. You may begin to worry, sniff the water that comes out of your taps, run water for 30 seconds before using it to cook or drink, or even make plans to buy bottled water or a water filter. Get the facts before you act. Consider the following:\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contact your municipal water supplier. You have the right to review their annual Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) for ongoing water quality issues. If there is a widespread, short-term problem, your municipal water supplier will have some sort of statement prepared, and will likely have it posted on their website along with instructions on what to do.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contact local news and media outlets. If there\u2019s a problem, they will more than likely know what\u2019s going on. And if you are the first to bring it to their attention, they will probably investigate it!\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contact local hospitals or a trusted doctor. If there\u2019s been a spike in recent cases of water-borne illnesses or sickness related to contamination, they will know about it and be able to tell you what the danger is to you and your family, what symptoms to look out for and how to avoid it.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Check the EPA\u2019s website for information on contaminants that are prevalent in your area. This can be a good guide, but is rarely specific enough to really tell you enough information on your home or neighborhood. (Or try the Water Quality Association\u2019s Interactive Problem Solver .)\n5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have your water tested. This is only applicable if the problem persists and the local water treatment supplier is unable to correct the levels of contamination. Find out what, exactly, the problem is so you can take steps to correct the problem yourself.\nNow, what to do if there is a problem? And worse yet, what if the problem is persistent? You can go the bottled water route, but that leaves you vulnerable while bathing. I\u2019d go with a water filter, for both drinking and bathing water, with a carbon filter that is certified by one of the two main independent certification organizations: Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or National Sanitation Foundation (NSF). Also, check out this guide for how to choose a water filter .\nTreat the problem, not the symptoms\nWe all have to work together to keep the federal, state, and local government accountable for how they treat the nation\u2019s water supply. This is not an issue that lobbyists should be deciding, but sadly it does come to that from time to time. Make your voice and your opinions known.

It\u2019s even cheaper <em>than</em> pitcher filters.", "explanation": null, "document": "Categories: Aquasana Water Filters , Healthy Living , Tips for Health\nDetoxing your life means more than just losing that holiday weight or nixing the caffeine. It\u2019s a good idea to examine all aspects of your life to uncover places you can cut down on the number of harmful chemicals and contaminants that affect you every day. Here are some places to get the ball rolling.\nFilter your water: You know how we feel about this one! I won\u2019t go into all the detail so well covered on the rest of our site, but suffice it to say that filtering both your drinking and bathing water can do wonders for your health and well-being (and peace of mind).\n-Did you know that in 2010, one of the top five recommendations of the President\u2019s Cancer Panel for the prevention of environmentally caused cancer is to filter the water you drink? Every water source is different, even in taps from home to home.\u00a0Variability is driven by local pollutants, water treatment techniques, the age and material composition of the pipes that deliver your water, and the faucet that you use. Even if you have the purest water being delivered to you by your municipal water source, your pipes may leach unwanted contaminants into the water in transport.\u00a0 Unfiltered tap water can contain harmful contaminants like chlorine, lead, pesticides, herbicides and cysts, and what\u2019s in your water varies by your geographic location and municipal water supply.\nAudit your cupboard and fridge: That\u2019s right, I said audit. Maybe the looming advent of tax season has my brain going crazy with the term, but there are a few things you might want to take stock of.\n-Sodium tri-poly-what? Anything containing an ingredient you cannot pronounce has got to go. I\u2019m not necessarily advocating a return to the hunter/gatherer diet regimen, but it\u2019s a safe bet that all those complex chemical formulas for extending the shelf life of food is not doing a heck of a lot of good for your body.\n-Sell by 1997: Whoops! Check your sell-by dates and toss/recycle the stuff that has expired. If it\u2019s just a bit past the date and you feel comfortable eating it, that\u2019s all right: what I\u2019m going for here is to get rid of items that may have been named in an FDA recall sometime in the mid-90s.\n-Green/Yellow/Red: Categorize your cabinet and fridge contents into Green, Yellow, and Red categories. Green being healthy: can eat whenever I want; Yellow being okay in moderation; Red being SPECIAL OCCASION ONLY. I\u2019m not a nutrition expert, but I strive for a mix of 50% Green category foods, 35% Yellow, and no more than 15% Red. (Hey, I never said I was perfect!)\nTrash harsh chemical cleaning supplies: Some of the airborne toxins and residues of popular cleaning supplies can do more harm than good to you and your families. And my suggestion for an alternative is\u2026 vinegar. That\u2019s right, plain and simple old white distilled vinegar, which is natural, non-toxic, and friendly to the Earth. It\u2019s mildly acidic, which allows it to clean effectively and help keep your family healthy and safe. See www.vinegartips.com for 1001 uses for our lovely (inexpensive) friend.\nCheck your clothing: The word for health these days is organic, and when it comes to clothing, the story is no different.\n-Holy cotton! There\u2019s new and trending research out there that states that the pesticides used to grow that cotton that makes it into\nour clothing can be deadly. The manufacturing processes add in more chemicals and toxins, and some dyes and ink are also highly toxic.\n-Detergent degenerates: And check what you wash your clothes in, too! Those fragrant and ultra-whitening detergents can exacerbate skin conditions like eczema and wreak havoc on people who suffer from allergies, which says nothing about the possible toxins seeping in through your pores. I know some of those organic and non-toxic detergents don\u2019t have the same \u201cget it whiter and brighter\u201d promises that the Big Brands do, but I think I could buy a new blouse a little more often or be more careful if it meant remaining healthy for a few more years.\n5 Ways to Determine if You Need to Worry about Tap Water Contamination\nFriday, December 3rd, 2010\nCategories: Aquasana Water Filters , Carbon Filter , Contaminants in Drinking Water , Environment , faucet water filters , Methods of Filtration , Shower Filters\nYou may have heard the reports of the 60,000 chemicals from our industries that sometimes make their way into our drinking water supplies; the press keeps us abreast on what contaminants affect your water. You\u2019ve no doubt heard all the dramatic warnings concerning the dangers of heavy metals, chlorine, bacteria, viruses, pesticides, volatile organic compounds, cow pee and fairy dust. Depending on the amount of unfiltered tap water you consume and the specific contaminants, you and your family\u2019s health may be at risk.\nContaminants everywhere\nThe Gulf Oil Spill. Lead and giardiasis in city water. Water boiling warnings. You\u2019ve seen this stuff all over the news, especially when the media run stories on local water supplies showing that this or that contaminant has been found. In these circumstances, your concern is probably justified. You may begin to worry, sniff the water that comes out of your taps, run water for 30 seconds before using it to cook or drink, or even make plans to buy bottled water or a water filter. Get the facts before you act. Consider the following:\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contact your municipal water supplier. You have the right to review their annual Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) for ongoing water quality issues. If there is a widespread, short-term problem, your municipal water supplier will have some sort of statement prepared, and will likely have it posted on their website along with instructions on what to do.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contact local news and media outlets. If there\u2019s a problem, they will more than likely know what\u2019s going on. And if you are the first to bring it to their attention, they will probably investigate it!\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contact local hospitals or a trusted doctor. If there\u2019s been a spike in recent cases of water-borne illnesses or sickness related to contamination, they will know about it and be able to tell you what the danger is to you and your family, what symptoms to look out for and how to avoid it.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Check the EPA\u2019s website for information on contaminants that are prevalent in your area. This can be a good guide, but is rarely specific enough to really tell you enough information on your home or neighborhood. (Or try the Water Quality Association\u2019s Interactive Problem Solver .)\n5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have your water tested. This is only applicable if the problem persists and the local water treatment supplier is unable to correct the levels of contamination. Find out what, exactly, the problem is so you can take steps to correct the problem yourself.\nNow, what to do if there is a problem? And worse yet, what if the problem is persistent? You can go the bottled water route, but that leaves you vulnerable while bathing. I\u2019d go with a water filter, for both drinking and bathing water, with a carbon filter that is certified by one of the two main independent certification organizations: Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or National Sanitation Foundation (NSF). Also, check out this guide for how to choose a water filter .\nTreat the problem, not the symptoms\nWe all have to work together to keep the federal, state, and local government accountable for how they treat the nation\u2019s water supply. This is not an issue that lobbyists should be deciding, but sadly it does come to that from time to time. Make your voice and your opinions known. Write your regional and state representatives, let them know you feel water contamination needs more attention, help set the agenda and get out there and vote on Election Day.\nTap water contamination isn\u2019t a hoax, and it\u2019s no laughing matter. There really are contaminants in your drinking water. Small amounts of those pollutants aren\u2019t usually harmful, but exposure to large portions of impurities affects your health.\nFor more information, check out some of the stories out there on water quality and the issues that surround it.\n"}]]}
