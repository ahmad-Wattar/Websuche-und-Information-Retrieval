At Murray's we think of seven types that we find clear and simple to understand:\nThese types group cheeses that provide a consistent eating experience. Our types will help you find a cheese you like according to the following descriptions:\nFresh\nThink: Young. Tart. Tangy. Lemony. Smooth. Moist. Creamy. No rind. Find: Fresh goat cheese (\"Chevre ), Mozzarella\nBloomy\nRefers to the snowy, fluffy, \"blooming\" rind. Think: White. Buttery. Decadent. Pillowy. Fluffy. Rich. Mild to Mushroomy. Edible rind.

Find: Aged Gouda, Dry Jack, Parmigiano-Reggiano\nBlue\nThink: Mold! Veins. Craters. Big. Sharp-edged. Punchy. Complex. Find: Gorgonzola, Roquefort, Stilton\nHow do I Serve Cheese?\nServe all cheeses at room temperature! Remove cheeses from the refrigerator at least an hour before serving. Hard cheeses take longer to reach room temperature. As a rustic peasant food, cheese displays well on wood or marble or stone boards, surrounded by fruits (simplest - a bunch of grapes), nuts, crusty bread and wine. Try to avoid cubing or slicing in advance, and put out one cheese knife or cheese plane per cheese. For a big crowd, where self-service is key, you may pre-slice or cube, but the cheese will dry out quickly and, as a display technique, it's fairly cheesy. If you must precut cheese, use a covered cheese dome.\nCheese Boards/Cheese Course\nSome basic things to consider when serving a cheese course:\nAs hors d'oeurves, avoid sweet triple cremes (which are more for dessert), blues (too strong), or very aged cheese (also too strong). Stick to bloomy rinds, medium washed rinds or semi-softs.\nThree to five cheeses are enough for any course. Less is more in this case.\nAfter dinner cheeses would typically start with a fresh cheese (e.g., chevre) or bloomy rind (e.g., camembert); then a semi-soft or medium cheese (e.g., Morbier or Cheddar); then a harder cheese (e.g., an aged Gouda); finally a blue (e.g., Roquefort).\nA cheese plate is arranged in clockwise fashion with the first cheese at midnight on the plate.\nIt's a good idea to vary the milk types, too: goat, sheep and cow.\nDon't be afraid to experiment. Start with what you like first and work around it.\nNeed help? Contact us! (1-888-692-433)\nHow Do I Store Cheese?\nOur number one recommendation is to buy smaller pieces of cheese more often, because a reputable cheesemonger is better equipped to store cheese. That said, here are our guidelines for home storage:\nMost references will tell you never, never, never wrap your cheese in plastic wrap. And with good reason. If you're like us, you buy a bunch of cheese, put it in your fridge, and forget about it for two weeks. By then, the cheese has been tightly wrapped, never seeing the light of day, never getting any fresh air, and it has died of suffocation. Seriously. Cheese is a living food. It needs to breathe. The rind on bloomy and washed cheese cannot survive without oxygen. The exposed surface of Parmigiano-Reggiano, for example, will get sweaty and then dry out without fresh air.\nBut for most people at home, what are your choices?\nWe say: Be realistic. Wrap first in wax paper to protect the surface flavor of a cheese, and then in plastic wrap to ensure it can't dry out. Promise not to forget about the cheese. Change its wrapping every couple for days, which also gives an excuse to nab a small bite.\nUse foil for higher moisture blue cheeses.\nThe vegetable drawer is slightly warmer and moister than the rest of the fridge, and so provides a less hostile environment. Plus, it prevents cross-contamination of flavor and aroma with other food in your fridge.\nSpecial cheese cellars and refrigerators are a hot trend right now, but we've had respectable success \"aging\" cheese the old fashioned way. Take a Tupperware container, line it with a damp paper towel, and poke holes in the lid for air. It's the perfect abode for a cheese that's not quite ripe.\nWhat Else Can I Serve with Cheese?\nAlmonds help bring out the subtleties of cheese flavor and aroma. Toasted hazelnuts and walnuts interchangeably work with cheese, and pecans go well with sweet or unctous cheeses.\nOlives naturally complement sheep and goat's milk cheese.\nExperiment with dried fruits like raisins, figs, dates, and any number of berries.\nChutneys are a tasty alternative that meld nicely with the texture and nuances of English farmhouse cheeses. Chutney with Cheddar is simply delicious. French chevre with its stark white moist, flaky or crumbly paste is a choice for chutney, also perfect with juicy plums.\nFruit pastes, such as membrillo made of quince, with slices of an array of semi-hard sheep's milk cheeses from Spain, French Pyrenees, Sardinia, and delicate flavored cow's milk cheeses like Caerphilly, are sure to bring delight.\nThe sweetest seasonal fruits are the ones to choose. Try blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and whatever other ripe and bursting with flavor fresh fruits are available. Apples with Cheddar and pears with Stilton always bring pleasure\nCharcuterie: Serve thin slices of proscuitto, Serrano ham and sweet or spicy salamis, especially with aged cheeses like Pecorino and Manchego. If you choose to serve crackers, pick unsalted ones, but bread is a must; you can never go wrong with a baguette. Crusty rustic sourdough with creamy soft ripened creations, and grain-packed hearty selections with Cheddars and the like, or perhaps specialty breads with bits of dried fruit and nuts, or olives baked in.\nMurray's Frequently Asked Questions on Cheese\nIn 68 years of cheese, we've heard it all. Here are the most frequently asked questions and their answers!\nQ: This cheese stinks!\u00a0 What's with that?\nA: We've been known to clear a subway car with a bag of cheese cut 15 minutes ago. Cheese wrapped in a bag or box can smell pretty intense, but that's no cause for concern. Just get it into the fridge and remember to give it an hour at room temperature before serving.\nQ: How do I store cheese?\nA: A few tips: 1) When possible, reuse the Murray's cheese paper your cheese arrived in. It protects but allows breathability. 2) Buy more Murray's cheese paper! Seriously. It extends shelf life by 5-7 days. 3) Wrap in wax paper or parchment covered in plastic wrap (paper alone and the cheese will dry right out) 4) Plastic wrap is okay for harder cheeses, but rewrap 2-3 times a week 5) Use aluminum foil for blues 6) Try the crisper drawer it's a bit warmer and moister than the rest of the fridge 7) Refrigerate 8) NEVER FREEZE CHEESE\nQ: How do I serve the cheese?\nA: Always remove your cheese from the fridge at least an hour before serving you'll want it at room temperature. Provide separate knives or serving utensils for each cheese so you don't mix flavors. We like cheese with plain bread or crackers, but you can liven it up with fruit breads and garnishes like dried apricots, Medjool dates, dried cherries or cranberries, nuts, fresh sliced apple or pear, fruit chutney or local honey.\nQ: How much cheese do I need?\nA: We recommend 1 ounce per person per cheese, assuming a selection of 3-5 cheeses. We find more than 5 gets overwhelming. That means a standard gift selection, with half a pound of five different cheeses will comfortably feed 8 people for noshes, or 4 people for dinner, if you add some wine, bread and a salad!\nQ: How long can I keep my cheese?\nA: This is real cheese not the stuff in a can. That means you're looking at 3-4 weeks maximum, and that's for the hard cheeses like Gruyere or Parmigiano-Reggiano. Fresh cheeses (bright white, no rind) should be eaten with 7 days of opening. Soft, creamy cheeses like Brie and Taleggio should be eaten within 10-14 days. If you see small dots of surface mold on your hard cheese, it can be scraped off. It won't hurt you, or the flavor of your cheese, and it beats tossing the whole piece out.\u00a0 Honestly, though.\u00a0 Why store it when you know you can eat it all in one sitting? Call your friends!!\nQ: What is raw milk cheese?\nA: Raw milk cheese, aka unpasteurized cheese, refers to cheese made with milk that has not been heat treated by pasteurization.\u00a0 In the US, pasteurization is required of all cheese sold at less than 60 days of age, the intention being the elimination of potentially harmful pathogens. We play by the rules, so if it's under 60 days it will be pasteurized milk, but over that two-month mark we've got hundreds of raw-milk offerings, many of which boast a deeper and more complex flavor.\nQ: What does it mean for a cheese to be in (or out of) season?\nA: Animals left to their natural cycles do not make milk all the time. No milk, no cheese. Goats and sheep are particularly finicky breeders, and tend to mate in the fall and stop milking during the winter months. That may mean shortages of younger styles during December-April. As for cows, they can produce milk at any time of year, but the early spring and fall milk, when cows munch on grasses and flowers, is considered the most flavorful and fuels singularly delicious cheese.\nQ: Do I eat the rind? How do I know?\nA: The short answer is: the rind will never kill you, though we avoid those made of cloth or wax. Ick. The rule we use is, if the rind is a soft, thin skin on the outside of the cheese then we consider it edible. If the rind is a thick, chewy, hard or sharp-edged crust, then we do not. Don't be fooled by color! They are some Day-Glo orange, blue and green rinds that taste magnificent.\nThere are no Items\n"}, {"score": 2040.3215, "uuid": "c4c5c375-ff6b-5123-8c24-e5b25431b8f2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0203wb-13-11090", "target_hostname": "www.murrayscheese.com", "target_uri": "https://www.murrayscheese.com/edu_cheesebasics.asp", "page_rank": 1.518764e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>Cheese</em> classes and <em>cheese</em> events in NYC", "snippet": "We play by the rules, so if it&#x27;s under 60 days it will be <em>pasteurized</em> milk, but over that two-month mark we&#x27;ve got hundreds of raw-milk offerings, many of which boast a deeper and more complex flavor.

Isn\u2019t this what most of us grew up with and liked? It begins pure enough as a young pasteurized cow\u2019s milk Cheddar, but so often ends up as machine sliced, plastic-separated, hamburger-friendly slices. During the process, the Cheddar is milled into shreds, \u201ccooked\u201d with added dyes, emulsifiers and other assorted \u201cdairy\u201d ingredients in order to achieve a smooth, mild (yet cheesy), orange or white, meltable, stable \u201cfood.\u201d It is extremely popular as over half of all cheese consumed in the United States is American Process(ed) Cheese.\u00a0 Of course, this includes Cheez Whiz and Velveeta.\nSince the majority of our ancestors came from somewhere else, we virtually have no original cheese heritage. The exceptions are Jack cheese, which originated in California and Brick and Colby, which originated in Wisconsin. Thankfully, we are in an artisanal cheese making revolution. Most of the cheese we buy is purchased in supermarkets and is massed produced. What else can we expect?\u00a0 The American food industry is geared toward mass production.\u00a0 Surprisingly, the United States is the world\u2019s largest cheese producer. But bigger is seldom better or even good. However, not everything we find at the grocery store these days is massed produced. The retail grocery industry is finally realizing that people are more traveled, educated and thirsty for originality.\nGROWTH OF ARTISAN CHEESE\nThere are some supermarket cheeses that seem to successfully straddle the line separating massed-produced from artisanal. One is Auricchio brand provolone. The more common name of the company is BelGioioso. Errico Auricchio\u2019s family started their cheese making company in Naples, Italy in 1877.\u00a0 It has grown to become the world\u2019s largest producer of Provolone cheese.\u00a0 In 1979, the family decided that it would be very beneficial to their industry if they produced their cheese in the U.S. for a variety of reasons including export costs, marketing structures and according to Errico, \u201cWisconsin offers the finest pasturage and livestock in the world.\u201d By 1984, Errico, who oversees the Wisconsin facility realized that the facility was operating at capacity and that the demand for the Provolone was still growing.\u00a0 Another plant was built and a third was opened soon afterward. The Auricchio Provolone made in Wisconsin is identical to the company\u2019s Italian made Provolone, which is available primarily in Italian specialty food shops.\nAnother cheese that seems to \u201cstraddle\u201d the line is Tillamook Cheddar from Oregon. This company started out as a cooperative dating back to 1909. The founding dairy farmers and cheese makers were Swiss and profoundly surprised that their attempts to produce their beloved Swiss cheeses in a climate atypical of Switzerland, failed miserably. The lush coastal area of Oregon is almost constantly cloudy and very humid.\u00a0 As a result, the Swiss-style cheeses were not to be. The early members of the cooperative enlisted the help of a Scottish-Canadian named Peter McIntosh, who advised them to turn their sights to Cheddar, a cheese more suited to the climate. Under his expertise, Tillamook became and remains a premium Cheddar.\nLet\u2019s turn south. In 1982, Paula Lambert persuaded two friends to invest in her idea of starting a company that would produce Mozzarella cheese in Dallas. She found and renovated a little building in an old warehouse district near downtown Dallas. In August, a professor of cheese came from Italy and taught her how to make fresh Mozzarella (a passion she acquired while visiting Italy when she was younger). Thus, their venture called The Mozzarella Company was born. Paula has worked aggressively to build a reputation for quality, creating a demand not only for handmade domestic Mozzarella but also a line of more than 25 specialty cheeses and dairy products with a Texas twist.\nOf course, we cannot overlook Maytag Blue from Iowa. In Newton, Iowa, the Maytag family has two passions: appliances and cheese.\u00a0 You may wonder, why make cheese and not just market milk? The sons of Elmer Maytag (whose father founded the appliance company) did try milk, but there was no fun or profit in it at that time. After their father died in 1940, Frederick and Robert utilized the services of an Iowa State University dairy professor who advised them that a premium blue cheese might be the way to go. From 1941 to present, Maytag Blue has established itself purely by word of mouth. No advertising, no marketing or modernization.\u00a0 Eighty percent is sold via mail-order. Each four-pound (2 k) wheel is handmade from unpasteurized cow\u2019s milk, the curd hand-seeded with Penicillium roqueforti, then hand-ladled into hoops, hand-salted, and aged for six months in cellars carved directly into the side of a hill on the farm. Maytag also makes an Edam and white Cheddar.\nGOATS TO CHEESE\nTraveling back up to the northwestern area of the country, we find Sally Jackson Cheeses in Oroville, Washington. Sally has been making cheese for over 30 years, initially using milk from a modest herd of two goats and one cow. Her specialties are aged sheep\u2019s-milk and goat\u2019s-milk cheeses. She has been licensed as a business since 1979, and distributes to stores and gourmet restaurants all over the country.\nSally and her husband Roger operate their dairy farm with limited aid from new technologies. Although they have been selling their cheeses for over 25 years, the farm did not have electricity until 15 years ago. According to Sally \u201cin the beginning we didn\u2019t have it because we were environmentalists.\u201d They ran a generator, but the pile of oil cans grew and the noise was unbearable.\u00a0 Having electricity now allows the Jacksons to not only have lights, but also run a small window air conditioner in the aging room of the cheese house and refrigerates the milk from the evening\u2019s milking. They collaborate with local farms to obtain most of what they need. Sally does not use a rind for her cheeses.\u00a0 Instead, she uses chestnut and grape leaves as her signature wrapping material. The chestnut leaves are from the grove of a local man who has spent years cultivating chestnut trees of his own. The grape leaves are harvested from one of the many vineyards in the area. According to Steve Jenkins, author of The Cheese Primer, \u201cHer American Treasures will knock you out and wake up your taste buds.\u201d\nAnother goat\u2019s milk cheese worth seeking out is Laura Chenel\u2019s Ch\u00e8vre. Laura is a pioneer in the art of American-made goat\u2019s-milk cheeses in the French style.\u00a0 Her business began commercial production in 1981. She purchased her first goats in the 1970s. Laura\u2019s interest in developing the finest tasting cheese guided her to France for four months to live with farm families in various regions, learning the secrets of ch\u00e8vre-making. Her ch\u00e8vres are as close to the French original as you will find. They are bone-white, flaky, barely moist and extraordinarily delicious.\nThere are hundreds of small, artisanal, cheese-making dairies in the United States. How fortunate for us that we no longer have to totally rely on imported cheese to satisfy our cravings for products reflecting uniqueness and individuality. Try to seek out these talented artisans at your local farmer\u2019s markets. Talk to your local restaurants that support local farmers. Who knows what treasures you may find?\nMembership Menu\n"}, {"score": 1852.7383, "uuid": "116b8709-c79e-5b7e-83ca-101d2edab0f2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0610wb-31-26340", "target_hostname": "www.thenibble.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thenibble.com/zine/archives/vermont-butter-and-cheese.asp", "page_rank": 1.2130149e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Vermont Butter And <em>Cheese</em>", "snippet": "As salt <em>does</em>, it helps to enhance flavors, such that the Salted Butter <em>tastes</em> creamier and more buttery <em>than</em> the Unsalted Butter! Will all the butter manufacturers in America please try this and then reduce the amount of salt in their butters by 75%?", "explanation": null, "document": "It\u2019s spring\u2014take advantage of those tender,\nfresh peas.\nOverview\nWith the ubiquity of ch\u00e8vre in the U.S. today, it\u2019s hard to think that, not too long ago, the only goat cheese around was imported from France. When Allison Hooper was a young woman with a degree in food science, Americans had to go to Europe to learn how to make artisan cheese. Even today, apprentices earn no money, just room and board; and if you want to learn to make French cheeses, you\u2019d better speak French, because the farmer-cheesemakers in the countryside sure don\u2019t speak English.\nAllison returned to her native Vermont with a passion to make cheese, and a few years later had the opportunity to make ch\u00e8vre for a banquet held by the Vermont Department of Agriculture. It was very well received, and in 1984, Allison and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s marketing director, Bob Reese, decided to found Vermont Butter & Cheese Company\u2014a pioneering decision, since artisan cheese wasn\u2019t even a blip on the national radar.\nSince then, the initial simple, mild, fresh goat\u2019s milk cheese has expanded to a line of fresh, aged and flavored ch\u00e8vres and a state-of-the-art cheesemaking facility. The lone cheesemaker now has a scientific approach to cheesemaking and a staff of 29 to assist. Almost all of its products have earned the most prestigious awards in cheesemaking.\nToday, the company makes a line of gourmet cow\u2019s milk dairy products in the European tradition: three types of cultured butter, cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche, mascarpone and quark. All of the cow\u2019s milk products are made with pasteurized, rBGH-free milk and cream from 21 local family farms. The goat\u2019s milk also comes from local farms, and VBC has a goat nanny\u2014not a nanny goat, but an animal expert who works with the goat farmers to help ensure the happiest, most productive goats and best-quality milk for VBC\u2019s goat cheeses.\nThe creamery uses microbial rennet so that the cheeses are vegetarian. (Rennet is a coagulating enzyme that is added to milk, as the first step in making cheese. It curdles the milk, causing curds to form and separate from the whey. Standard rennet is made from the lining of calves\u2019 stomachs.)\nBonne Bouche. One of our favorite nibbles at the 2007 Fancy Food Show, it won the top honors as best product in the Cheese and Dairy category.\nFresh Ch\u00e8vre\nCh\u00e8vre, the French word for goat, is characterized by its snow-white paste and tangy, distinctive flavor. Fresh cheeses are most often sold as logs (b\u00fbches) and disks. With their creamy pastes, they are versatile partners...from the cheese board to fillings for crepes, omelets, chicken breasts and ravioli, to ingredients for cheesecake, even ice cream.\nDelicious fresh ch\u00e8vre with black, green and pink peppercorns has festive looks that turn any dish into party fare.\nOne of our favorite light lunches is a \u201cgoatwich\u201d: ch\u00e8vre spread on a crusty roll, with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. Sometimes the ch\u00e8vre comes dressed, like the peppercorn ch\u00e8vre at the left, or VBC\u2019s basil ch\u00e8vre. With the plain ch\u00e8vre, we can serve it savory, with fresh tomatoes and basil and a few grinds of fresh pepper, or sweet, with a drizzle of our favorite Savannah Bee Company artisan honeys.\u00a0 (For fusion, try the honey with black pepper.)\nIf you haven\u2019t had a fresh ch\u00e8vre pizza yet, you\u2019re in for a treat. If you can score a cornmeal crust, so much the better.\nA classic mesclun salad adds a disk of goat cheese, or a slice from a log, often rolled in toasted pecans, pistachios or walnuts and baked or warmed. But if all you do is crumble it on salad, you\u2019ll still be happy. It also pairs well with slices of pear or apple.\nFresh ch\u00e8vre on a good bagel is another favorite fusion food. It can make one forget cream cheese. Of course, add the smoked salmon and dill.\nAged Goat Cheeses: Bijou, Bonne Bouche, Coupole\nAs goat cheese ages, it develops an edible white rind. Aged ch\u00e8vres are made in a variety of shapes, including cones, crottins, cylinders, disks, domes, logs and pyramids. The paste will vary from creamy to semi-firm, depending on the age.\nVBC makes three aged ch\u00e8vres, each distinctly different. In our comments, note that we obtained our cheeses directly from VBC. Cheeses purchased elsewhere may or may not have more age to them.\nBijou, shown at the top of the page, is a small crottin; the name means \u201cjewel\u201d in French. These little jewels are classically oven-warmed and served with a green salad. The thick paste is almost fudge-like, and perhaps even more enjoyable as it melts on the tongue. While one of these 1-1/2-inch diameter crottins would make a feast for a cheese lover, they can be halved and shared. One package contains two crottins.\nThis cheese shows well at any course. If it is fresh or just mildly aged, enjoy it at a special breakfast with toast made from top-quality crusty bread.\nBonne Bouche ( photo above), literally \u201cgood mouthful\u201d and, more colloquially, \u201ctasty morsel\u201d in French, certainly is that and more. A hand-ladled (into molds), ash-ripened cheese with a bloomy rind, inside is a cheese far more delicate than Brie and many familiar cheeses of this category. You can play the affineur and age this charmer yourself at home. There\u2019s a \u201cmade date\u201d on the package, along with instructions on how to age it if you prefer the cheese softer and with a drier, more piquant rind. It has the mild, floral, acidic elements of a fresh ch\u00e8vre, with the complex, nuttier notes of an aged cheese. We\u2019re mad for it either way, and need to be restrained from eating the whole bouche at once.\nCoupole, the French word for dome, is a classic beauty that reads the script of goat cheese perfection.\nServe it quartered, with a mesclun salad dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette\nServe it quartered in first course with grilled vegetables (asparagus, now in season,\nare wonderful), drizzled with a little balsamic vinegar\nCoupole (photo above) means dome, and this cheese is a lovely, snowy dome with classic flavors so dear to the hearts of lovers of ch\u00e8vre. The recipe is the same as Bijou; the paste, a bit more dense. And, this shape remains standing no matter how many slices are taken from it. No toppled remains here\u2014as if there will be any remains.\nThis is a beautiful choice for a cheese board and a wonderful introduction to fine ch\u00e8vre for those who have not experienced it.\nAs a garnish, serve nuts (almonds, pecans, walnuts or a mix) and dried fruits\u00a0or fresh pears.\nFor an interesting salad course, top a mixture of radicchio and watercress, in a walnut oil vinaigrette, with a wedge of Coupole. Garnish with some fresh-cracked pepper .\nWine Pairings: All of these cheeses pair best with Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Gris. If you must, try a lighter-style Chardonnay; but anything oaky will overpower the delicate flavors. Some people enjoy a dry, sparkling wine, but we have never felt that sparkling wine was the best pairing with these cheeses (on the other hand, for triple cr\u00e8mes, bring on the bubbly). Those who only enjoy red wine should try a light-bodied Pinot Noir.\nCultured Butters\nWhen you mention Vermont Butter & Cheese to people who have tasted the company\u2019s butter, the first thing you hear is: \u201cThat butter is great!\u201d How great can butter be, you ask? Well, how great can cheese be? VBC\u2019s butter is so good, you\u2019ll be tempted to eat it plain, just like a good piece of cheese. These world-class butters are made from that day\u2019s fresh local cream. One bite and you\u2019ll know you\u2019re not in Kansas anymore, as Dorothy Gale might say...but you\u2019ll know you\u2019re in Vermont.\nOne of three types of cultured butter made by Vermont Butter & Cheese Company. After pasteurization, the cream is fermented by adding a bacteria culture. The cream rests in its vat for a day to allow the culture to develop complex flavors and aromas. This is the difference between cultured butter and regular, or sweet cream, butter. When fermentation is complete, the cream is churned into butter.\nThe company makes cultured butter, which is different from the sweet cream butter made in the U.S. Butter is made by churning fresh or fermented cream.\nSweet cream butter, churned from fresh cream, is what most Americans eat. It is called sweet cream butter whether it is lightly salted, unsalted or whipped. The distinction is that it is made from sweet cream, not fermented or cultured cream (also called soured cream). Tidbit: Butter can be made from a combination of milk and cream, and must contain at least 80% milk fat (butterfat) by weight. Cheaper butters have more milk, artisan butters are all cream\u2014and thus richer and more flavorful.\nCultured butter is made from fresh cream; lactic acid cultures have been added for flavor development, which \u201cripens\u201d the cream.* It is a richer style of butter, generally higher in butterfat and moisture, than sweet cream butter. This style is popular in Europe and is now being produced by artisans in the U.S. It is preferred by bakers, because butterfat levels as high as 86% create more elastic crusts and dough. (Read more in the caption at the left.) A good fresh, cultured butter has a delicate cream flavor\u2014you can taste the fresh cream it was churned from\u2014with faint nutty notes.\n*Sweet cream butter first became available in the 19th century with the advent of refrigeration and other technology. Prior to then, cream was generally collected from several milkings over a few days, and natural fermentation had already begun by the time it was made into butter. During fermentation, bacteria convert milk sugars into lactic acid, which sours the cream and produces more complex flavors and aromas and a richer, more \u201cbuttery\u201d product. In the U.S. and elsewhere, cultured butter is made from pasteurized cream with Lactococcus and Leuconostoc bacteria introduced to induce fermentation. However, in some countries, raw (unpasteurized) butter is available.\nNot only are these butters exquisite in flavor; they are a boon to the lactose intolerant. During fermentation, the bacteria cultures consume almost all of the lactose that remains in regular butter to produce flavor. If you have a lactose-intolerant friend, we can\u2019t imagine a better gift.\nVBC makes three types of cultured butter: unsalted, lightly salted and sea salt.\nThe lovely yellow color\u2014which does not show up in all of its glory in the photo at the right\u2014comes from the high-quality diet of the cows. When cows are grazing on grass in a pasture, as opposed to eating feed in a barn, they ingest natural carotene in the grass. Carotene is the vegetable form of vitamin A found in carrots and all yellow and orange vegetables. In addition, artisan butter, churned in a \u201cbatch\u201d or \u201cbarrel\u201d churn, is more yellow than butter that is manufactured in a \u201ccontinuous\u201d churn.\nCultured Butters For Every Day\nWarning: All three VBC butters are so good, if you have a habit of eating butter straight from the bar or tub, don\u2019t try these alone. You\u2019ll need friends to restrain you.\nThe logs of unsalted or salted butter, shown wrapped above and partially-unwrapped at the right, are perfect for everyday cooking and eating.\nBoth have won awards at the American Cheese Society\u2019s annual competition.\nThe cultured butter as it appears underneath the \u201chappy cow\u201d wrapping paper above (the butter is much more yellow in person). It\u2019s easy to slice off what you need and re-wrap the rest for maximum freshness.\nWe can\u2019t tell you how good these are except to say, if you love butter, send for one of each. You\u2019ll say, \u201cEureka!\u201d\u2020\n\u2020Eureka is Greek for \u201cI have found it.\u201d\u00a0 It is attributed to the Greek scholar and physician Archimedes, who reportedly shouted it upon discovering how to calculate the volume of irregular objects, until then an unsolvable problem. When stepping into his bath one day, he noticed the water level rise and realized that the volume of water that was displaced must be equal to the volume of the mass of his body. He is said to have been so excited by his discovery that he leaped out of the bath and ran through the streets of Syracuse naked (it wasn\u2019t a misdemeanor back then). \u201cEureka\u201d is also the state motto of California. It refers to the 1848 discovery of gold near Sutter\u2019s Mill, which attracted people to the territory from all over the world, eventually creating the state.\nThe Unsalted Butter is a lovely butter that will enhance everything it touches. But we, who never eat regular salt butters, are so enamored of VBC\u2019s two salted butters, we must twist your arm: If you\u2019re not planning to buy all three, you must at least try the two salted varieties.\nThe Lightly Salted Butter is so wonderful: You taste the sweet cream on the palate before the tiniest amount of salt arrives to add more complexity. The butter has .33% salt\u2014that\u2019s one-third of a percent (known in French as demi-sel or half-salt), and one-sixth the salt of standard salted butter. The salt flavor is so light, this butter could \u201cpass\u201d as unsalted. But now that you know the salt is there, take a bite. Heaven! As salt does, it helps to enhance flavors, such that the Salted Butter tastes creamier and more buttery than the Unsalted Butter! Will all the butter manufacturers in America please try this and then reduce the amount of salt in their butters by 75%?\u00a0VBC has converted us lifelong unsalted butter users away from the mother bar; we now use their Salted Butter as our daily spread. Yes, it\u2019s that good.\nAside from eating it with a spoon, which is what we cultists do, both butters are ideal for any type of cooking or baking.\nCultured Butter With Sea Salt\u2014the \u201cOutstanding Cheese or Dairy Product\u201d winner at the 2004 Fancy Food Show...and in our home. The small, handmade wooden basket holds the covered motte (French for pat\u2014in this case, a six-ounce pat) of butter.\nCultured Sea Salt Butter\nBut for special treats and favorite guests, we clamor for the Cultured Sea Salt Butter. It\u2019s the same fine butter, salted with large crystals of Celtic sea salt. While Vermont Butter & Cheese Company began with a passion to make goat cheese, many view this Cultured Butter With Sea Salt, made from cow\u2019s milk cream, as the company\u2019s iconic product. Speak to cheesemongers and they\u2019ll recommend several goat cheeses to you...and insist you take home a little wooden tub of this butter. Fine chefs serve it to their restaurant patrons...and no doubt nip at it from time to time, as we do.\nWe serve it for special occasions, because the aforementioned logs of Unsalted Butter and Lightly Salted Butter are plenty wonderful for every day, and, like a great wine, even if money is no object, you don\u2019t want to get too familiar. You prefer that every bite will be as special when you have it again.\nCan you see the salt crystals? If you look hard enough you can\u2014but why look when you can taste? You\u2019ll get the crunch and the fine French sea salt flavor in every exquisite bite.\nServing Suggestions\nServe as a compound butter, adding a dab to grilled meats\nGarnish any vegetables\u2014it\u2019s worth the calories\nUse it as your butter with seafood or amazing corn on the cob\nTry it in cookie recipes (We tasted a memorable salted butter shortbread made with this butter, that made us want to try baking sea salt butter cookies. VBC also suggests using it in Cr\u00e8me Caramel.)\nThe die-happy-and-smiling recipe: pan-toasted bread, saut\u00e9ed with Cultured Butter With Sea Salt and topped with a slice of foie gras and a side of fresh figs\nTake it on a picnic\u2014even to your patio. The bright French paper wrapping puts you back in the Old Country (France), even before the taste does\nCr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche\nCr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is cultured cream, a thickened cream with a slightly tangy, nutty flavor and velvety, creamy texture. The fresh cream is set aside to let the natural lactic bacteria take over. The bacteria thicken the cream to a consistency and richness almost like sour cream, though with a more delicate texture and tartness. It does not separate or curdle when cooked with wine or at high temperatures, so is perfect for thickening sauces and soups, and imparting rich flavor and texture\u2014it is a staple of French cuisine. The French make cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche with unpasteurized cream; in the U.S., all fresh diary products must be made with pasteurized milk or cream.\nServing Suggestions\nCr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is the perfect accompaniment to everything, sweet or savory. It enhances everything from the caviar and blini at the beginning of the meal, to the chocolate cake at the end.\nWith caviar and blini: the most sumptuous treat (cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche smoothes out the saltiness of caviar)\nEasy hors d\u2019oeuvre: dollop atop a piece of cocktail bread with a slice of smoked salmon\nWith smoked salmon, capers and dill\nWith fresh fruit and berries is a simple but delicious summer dessert\nInstead of whipped cream with shortcake (mix with a small amount of sugar)\nWith fruit crisps and cobblers (add a sprinkle of cinnamon)\nOn dark chocolate cake with sweetened Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche and fresh raspberries\nWith baked potatoes\nIn sauces and soups (just a small amount of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche makes them extra creamy)\nIf you like sour cream, you\u2019ll love cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.\nFromage blanc, or \u201cwhite cheese,\u201d is snow white,\nindeed. At 120 calories per cup\u2014the same calories and protein as fat-free triple-strained Greek yogurt\u2014 you can eat the entire tub for lunch.\nFromage Blanc\nFromage blanc is a cow\u2019s milk cheese related to quark. It can be an astounding product: Whenever we are in France, we eat it nonstop (or at least twice a day, at lunch and from the cheese cart at dinner), rolling our eyes at how good it is. Some people sprinkle on a bit of sugar (try brown sugar!) or add fruit, but it requires nothing. It is totally fat free and all protein. (Quark is not fat free). Fromage blanc is also used in uncooked savory dishes. Since it has no butterfat, it will separate if cooked.\nWhile fromage blanc looks like yogurt (see photo at left), it is a proper cheese, beginning with rennet and a starter culture added to the milk. However, the curds are not allowed to coagulate as they would with a traditional cheese. Instead, they are stirred to the consistency of yogurt.\nWe admit to preferring French varieties because of the greater richness in flavor achieved from the unpasteurized milk\u2014you can\u2019t believe you are eating something that is fat free. But they are not available in this country and we are not in France. Also, although the fromagier at a restaurant will tell you the product is fat free, some cheesemakers themselves tell you that they add cream to achieve more richness, which can produce a product with up to 8% fat.\nAs for VBC\u2019s Fromage Blanc versus yogurt: Try it.\u00a0 You may discover something new and wonderful. In comparing the two, we have to admit a preference for our favorite, triple-strained plain Greek yogurt, FAGE Total with 0% fat\u2014in our eyes (and on our tongue), a miracle product. We\u2019ll eat every tub of VBC\u2019s Fromage Blanc that comes our way, but we\u2019ll stick to the FAGE for a richer experience with the same protein and calories. (Regular yogurt has neither the same richness nor protein density.)\nMascarpone\nWe can thank the popular dessert, tiramisu, for making more mascarpone available in the U.S. It is called \u201cItalian cream cheese,\u201d but has nothing to do with what is used to make American cheesecakes, spread on bagel and used as a base for toppings of pepper jelly or preserves that is served as a spread with crackers. And mascarpone isn\u2019t even cheese, as you\u2019ll learn in a moment. What it is, is a thick spoonful of creamy, slightly sweet, ultra-rich complex-flavored dairy product that tastes like sweet cream married to sweet fresh cheese.\nThis cow\u2019s milk product is native to the Lombardy region of Italy; however, it is not a cheese. In order to be a cheese, starter or rennet must be used in production. Mascarpone is made by draining the moisture from heavy cream using a small amount of citric acid and finely woven cloth. The result is similar to Devon cream or clotted cream.\nIncorporated into recipes as an ingredient (tiramisu is one of the most famous), it also makes simple yet luscious desserts.\nServing Suggestions:\nServe with fresh fruit and biscuits, like ginger snaps and gourmet graham crackers\nTop fresh berries and compotes\nThick, luscious mascarpone is often called \u201cItalian\ncream cheese,\u201d but don\u2019t even think of comparing it to the product purchased in bricks or whipped in tubs. \u201cMascarpone\u201d is one of the most misspelled words in the food world. People transpose the letters and erroneously call it mar-sca-pone. Nope. Think MASCAR, like NASCAR...but pronounce it mah-scar-POE-nay.\nStuff figs, dates or dried apricots (sprinkle with chopped pistachios)\nUse as the filling for cookie sandwiches\nFill tart shells and top the mascarpone with fresh or dried fruit\nEnjoy on toast and muffins\nToss with pasta and smoked salmon\nDessert Wine Pairing: Late Harvest Riesling, Passito di Pantelleria or Recioto di Soave.\nQuark\nQuark is the German word for curds.\u2021 This cow\u2019s milk cheese, produced all over Central Europe, is virtually identical to Fromage Blanc, but is whipped before packaging and has a higher fat content\u201480 calories per two-ounce portion, 50 from fat, compared to Fromage Blanc\u2019s 30 calories, zero from fat.\nWe love this quark. It has the flavor of a\u00a0 light sour cream, with the consistency of yogurt; and if you eat the whole tub as an indulgence, the 200 calories won\u2019t kill you. Quark can be eaten like yogurt, blended with fruit or jam. It is also a common ingredient used in filled pastries, savory and sweet sauces, spreads, souffl\u00e9s, cheesecakes and mousses. Quark is so popular in Germany that it accounts for almost half of that country's total cheese production (the average German eats about 10 pounds of quark a year).\n\u2021Use of the word \u201cquark\u201d to describe elementary particles of matter was taken from a poem inserted by James Joyce into Finnegan\u2019s Wake: \u201cThree quarks for Muster Mark!/Sure he hasn\u2019t got much of a bark/And sure any he has it\u2019s all beside the mark.\u201d This excerpt is from a 13-line poem directed against King Mark, the cuckolded husband in the Tristan and Isolde legend. Murray Gell-Mann, the physicist who received the 1969 Nobel Prize for his work in classifying quarks, was inspired by Joyce, not cheese curds. The allusion to three quarks seemed perfect to him, since originally there were only three subatomic particles.\nQuark has yogurt qualities in terms of viscosity and tang.

If you're thinking about drinking raw milk because you believe it has health benefits, consider other options.\nTrying to decide about raw milk?\nDeveloping a healthy lifestyle is a process with many decisions and steps. One step you might be thinking about is adding raw milk to your diet. Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful germs. Germs include bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It's important to understand the risks of drinking raw milk, especially because you may be hearing claims about the supposed \"benefits\" of raw milk.\nRaw milk contains bacteria, and some of them can be harmful. So, if you're thinking about consuming raw milk because you believe that it is a good source of beneficial bacteria, you need to know that it isn't and you may instead get sick from the harmful bacteria. If you think that certain types of bacteria may be beneficial to your health, consider getting them from foods that don't involve such a high risk. For example, so-called probiotic bacteria are sometimes added to pasteurized fermented foods, such as yogurt and kefir.\nMilk and products made from milk need minimal processing, called pasteurization, which can be done by heating the milk briefly (for example, heating it to 161\u00b0F for about 20 seconds). When milk is pasteurized, some bacteria remain in it, but the disease-causing ones are killed. Harmful germs usually don't change the look, taste, or smell of milk, so only when milk has been pasteurized can you be confident that these germs are not present. To ensure that milk is safe, processors rapidly cool it after pasteurization, practice sanitary handling, and store milk in clean, closed containers at 45\u00b0F or below.\nRemember, you can't look at, smell, or taste a bottle of raw milk and tell if it's safe to drink. Make the best decision for the health of your family. If you want to keep milk in your family's diet, protect them by not giving them raw milk. Even healthy adults can get sick from drinking raw milk. If you're thinking about drinking raw milk because you believe it has health benefits, consider other options.\nWho is at greatest risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk?\nThe risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk is greater for infants and young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer, an organ transplant, or HIV/AIDS, than it is for healthy school-aged children and adults. But, it is important to remember that healthy people of any age can get very sick or even die if they drink raw milk contaminated with harmful germs.\nWhat are the risks associated with drinking raw milk?\nRaw milk can carry harmful bacteria and other germs that can make you very sick or kill you. While it is possible to get foodborne illnesses from many different foods, raw milk is one of the riskiest of all.\nGetting sick from raw milk can mean many days of diarrhea, stomach cramping, and vomiting. Less commonly, it can mean kidney failure, paralysis, chronic disorders, and even death.\nMany people who chose raw milk thinking they would improve their health instead found themselves (or their loved ones) sick in a hospital for several weeks fighting for their lives from infections caused by germs in raw milk. For example, a person can develop severe or even life-threatening diseases, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, which can cause paralysis, and hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result in kidney failure and stroke.\nAren't raw or natural foods better than processed foods?\nMany people believe that foods with no or minimal processing are better for their health. Many people also believe that small, local farms are better sources of healthy food. However, some types of processing are needed to protect health. For example, consumers process raw meat, poultry, and fish for safety by cooking. Similarly, when milk is pasteurized, it is heated just long enough to kill disease-causing germs. Most nutrients remain after milk is pasteurized. There are many local, small farms that offer pasteurized organic milk and cheese products.\nI've heard that many organic and raw milk producers are creating sanitary and humane conditions for raising animals and producing \"safe\" raw milk and raw milk products (like cheeses and yogurts). Does this help reduce milk contamination?\nAdherence to good hygienic practices during milking can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of milk contamination. The dairy farm environment is a reservoir for illness-causing germs. No matter what precautions farmers take, and even if their raw milk tests come back negative, they cannot guarantee that their milk, or the products made from their milk, are free of harmful germs.\nGerms such as Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, and Salmonella can contaminate milk during the process of milking dairy animals, including cows, sheep, and goats. Animals that carry these germs usually appear healthy.\nHow does milk get contaminated?\nMilk contamination may occur from:\nCow feces coming into direct contact with the milk\nInfection of the cow's udder (mastitis)\nCow diseases (e.g., bovine tuberculosis)\nBacteria that live on the skin of cows\nEnvironment (e.g., feces, dirt, processing equipment)\nInsects, rodents, and other animal vectors\nHumans, for example, by cross-contamination from soiled clothing and boots\nPasteurization is the only way to kill many of the bacteria in milk that can make people very sick.\nInformation about raw milk-related outbreaks\nStates that allow the legal sale of raw milk for human consumption have more raw milk-related outbreaks of illness than states that do not allow raw milk to be sold legally.\nAmong dairy product-associated outbreaks reported to CDC between 1973 and 2009 in which the investigators reported whether the product was pasteurized or raw, 82% were due to raw milk or cheese. From 1998 through 2009, 93 outbreaks due to consumption of raw milk or raw milk products were reported to CDC. These resulted in 1,837 illnesses, 195 hospitalizations, and 2 deaths. Most of these illnesses were caused by Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, or Salmonella. It is important to note that a substantial proportion of the raw milk-associated disease burden falls on children; among the 93 raw dairy product outbreaks from 1998 to 2009, 79% involved at least one person younger than 20 years old.\nA study released by CDC in February 2012 examined the number of dairy outbreaks in the United States during a 13\u00e2\u0080\u0090year period. Between 1993 and 2006, 60% (73/121) of dairy-related outbreaks reported to CDC were linked to raw milk products. Three\u00e2\u0080\u0090quarters of these outbreaks occurred in states where the sale of raw milk was legal at the time. Experts also found that those sickened in raw milk outbreaks were 13 times more likely to be hospitalized than those who got ill from pasteurized milk during an outbreak.\nAs a consumer, you can take steps when grocery shopping and at home with all of your dairy products to minimize the risk of getting sick:\nOnly consume pasteurized milk and milk products. Look for the word \"pasteurized\" on the dairy labels. If in doubt, don't buy it!\nKeep pasteurized dairy products refrigerated at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below at home and dispose of any expired products to reduce the risk of illness.\nIf you consume soft, fresh, un-aged cheeses like queso fresco, make sure they are made from pasteurized milk. Aged cheeses made from raw milk are generally okay to eat because germs usually die off during the aging process. However, outbreaks associated with these cheeses have been identified.\nReported outbreaks represent the tip of the iceberg. For every outbreak and every illness reported, many others occur, and most illnesses are not part of recognized outbreaks. Protect yourself and your loved ones. Avoid raw milk, it's just not worth the risk.\nMore Information\n"}, {"score": 1775.4327, "uuid": "a98c31e2-f59a-554d-8293-c49ede0e1f03", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1610wb-70-02497", "target_hostname": "prettytothink.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://prettytothink.typepad.com/minor_gourmandry/cheese_plate/", "page_rank": 1.8743977e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Minor Gourmandry: <em>Cheese</em> Plate", "snippet": "The Champignou is <em>better</em> <em>than</em> nearly every soft young goat <em>cheese</em> I&#x27;ve tasted; even <em>better</em> <em>than</em> its Pascal Jacquin-made brethren, the Crottin de Champcol.", "explanation": null, "document": "Happy Milk\nStanding in front of a gourmet cheese counter is quite the adventure. The array can be daunting, with its convoluted names and variable shapes - and sometimes its noxious fumes - but these unfamiliarities merely add to the fun. No where else can you (liberally) taste a product with so extensive a biography -- culled from the milk of a billy grazing on a verdant hillside in a tiny Italian province; or one being as much a product of nature as one crafted (coaxed is more like it) by man. Those specimen splayed out on the cheesemonger's counter have as much character as anything you'll likely ever consume, unless you're a cannibal.\nMaybe you don't think about the affineur, who lovingly watches each cheeses' progression until its ready to be packaged. And maybe you don't concern yourself with how many hands your cheese passed through to land within your grasp, finally ready for consumption. If you don't care, I don't blame you (who has the time to dawdle with such things?). But for me, I will always admire the plight of the cheese sitting in the glass case before me -- for its distinctiveness, its artisan birthing, and, most of all, for its pleasurable taste. [Fade to black. Que American Cheese Society catch-phrase...Ah, the Power of Cheese...]\nCan you tell that I just returned home from a trip to Downtown Cheese, my purveyor of choice? Today I arrived home with some firsts: a Crottin de Champignou, a wedge of P'tit Basque and Manchego. Going global, to France for the first two and Spain for the latter, I've departed from my recent yen to find the best America has to offer (in part, because the Ardmore-based Downtown Cheese carries few American varietals). Finding a masterful cheese from our once overlooked continent always brings me great satisfaction. Saveur's lastest issue , April 2005, is host to an American Cheese top 50, among other wonderful articles about the issue's feature ingredient (you guessed it!). I'm such a list sucker, I just had to buy it.\nThe Champignou is better than nearly every soft young goat cheese I've tasted; even better than its Pascal Jacquin-made brethren, the Crottin de Champcol . Although neither of these cheese are A.O.C. like the renowned Crottin de Chavignol, they are far from slouches (actually, both are examples of \"Americanized,\" or\npasteurized, versions of the French one; some complain that the pasteurization kills the flavor of the Crottin s, but I enjoy them for their own merits). From the first piquant sensation to the pleasant lasting finish, I couldn't ask for much more, in terms of flavor, from the Champignou. I am hesitant to call the first rush of flavor sweet, but it definitely get the buds on the sides of my mouth tingling. A brochure I took from Dibruno bluntly states \"hazelnutty\" as a descriptor. Although I have a difficult time with picking out the nutty flavors of certain cheeses, I strongly disagree with such a tag. I find the flavor to be much more earthy -- which is what I like to call a cheese with a refreshing lactic (milky), grassy, or mushroomy taste -- typically my descriptor of soft goats. Final note on the goat: My tastings of young goat's milk cheeses is limited, so maybe the raw milk versions I've yet to encounter are far superior, but I wouldn't pass up a chance to enjoy the Champignou.\nThe P'tit Basque is another quality sheep's milk cheese by the company that makes Istara (which is an excellent unpasteurized Ossau-Iraty, a cheese that I've previously posted about). Although the similar Etorki (also spelled Etorky) is an excellent and supple snacking cheese, the P'tit Basque has a more profound flavor and is a bit thicker on the tongue. My tongue was surprised by the full fruity flavor of the cheese. Wonderful, and like the goat's milk mentioned above, non A.O.C.\nFinally, my feelings on the Manchego -- overrated. This seemingly super-popular Spanish cheese gave me little excitement. My ability to properly taste cheeses may have been altered by my recent allergies, but you'd think I'd get some response from the 'chego. Nothing. I may give it another whirl, but I am thoroughly sceptically about an opinion reversal. (The picture at top is the Manchego with some Spanish olives.)\n"}, {"score": 1769.8206, "uuid": "809a799b-f38d-5f25-b713-e961507f0127", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0112wb-68-19698", "target_hostname": "www.french-cheese.com", "target_uri": "http://www.french-cheese.com/10-pieces-of-advice-for-choosing", "page_rank": 1.2474141e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "10 pieces of advice for choosing <em>cheese</em>", "snippet": "These \u0093dressed up\u0094 <em>cheeses</em>, pure inventions of the dairy industry, usually come from <em>pasteurized</em> milk and have a standardized <em>taste</em>...", "explanation": null, "document": "Pour des raisons techniques, notre site www.french-cheese.com est suspendu pour quelques mois.\nNous vous remercions par avance pour votre compr\u00e9hension.\nL'\u00e9quipe French-cheese\nBecause of technical reasons, our website www.french-cheese.com will be closed for a few months.\nWe thank you in advance for your understanding.\nThe French cheese team.\n10 pieces of advice for choosing cheese\n1. FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF AN EXPERT\nThroughout the world, cheesemakers and cheesemasters devote their lives to cheese. They know them, love them, age them themselves, and scrupulously verify their origin and fabrication.Being an expert is something that cannot be improvised, so to discover the secrets of these genuine master artists, don\u2019t hesitate to follow their advice.\n2. RESPECT THE SEASONS\nYes, certain cheeses are seasonal. But here we are talking about periods of excellence ; yet a good number of cheeses are produced all the year long, and are not any less delectable\u00a0! For other cheeses it is better to enjoy them at the right moment, when their qualities and authenticity can be fully expressed.\nIn general, the season of consumption does not correspond to the season of production because of the aging period required after production. The reserve cheeses, those refined over the course of several months, are enjoyable all year long.\nA small guide to the seasons\u00a0:\nIn the winter, the moisture, absence of fresh pastures, and severe climate affect the quality of milk produced by the animals\u00a0: it\u2019s less rich and characteristic. As a result, the cheeses are far from their optimal taste.A cheese lover will tend to prefer cheeses produced during the previous spring and autumn because the lengthy aging period brings them to their peak of taste and maturity. These are generally pressed cheeses.\nSpring is the season of splendor for cheese, which will be at its best the following summer. Sun and fresh grass come together to produce a milk that is rich in new aromas\u2026Even better, it\u2019s the season for goat cheese\u00a0: don\u2019t miss it\u00a0!\nIn the summer, cheese, nourished by the freshness and renewal of spring, arrives at its full maturity. This is the time to taste the best Camembert, St. Nectaire, and, generally speaking, the soft cheeses.\nIn the autumn, after the summer\u2019s dryness, there is a renewal of the pastures\u00a0: the blue cheeses keep their flavors, the goat cheeses regain their strength, and the soft cheeses endure.\n3. BE CAREFUL OF \u0093INDUSTRIAL\u0094 CHEESES\nThese \u0093dressed up\u0094 cheeses, pure inventions of the dairy industry, usually come from pasteurized milk and have a standardized taste...\nThose who want authentic cheese should look for the following indications\u00a0: \u0093lait cru\u0094 (unpasteurized milk), \u0093fermier\u0094 (from the farm), and \u0093A.O.C\u0094 (Appellation d\u2019Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e, or registered trademark of origin).\n4. BE ASSURED OF THE CHEESE\u2019S ORIGIN\nA label of \u0093unpasteurized milk\u0094 is the only mark of a genuine regional cheese\u00a0: this is what guarantees its authenticity. Let\u2019s be clear\u00a0: a true Camembert can only come from Normandy, from the milk of cows of that region.\n5. DARE TO PUT ASIDE YOUR HABITS AND PRECONCEIVED IDEAS\nPut confidence in your local cheese specialist, he knows which cheese is at its prime. Describe what you would like in terms of texture and taste, and discuss the following with him\u00a0: the day, the occasion, and the food that will accompany the cheese. All of this information is valuable in receiving good advice, and you\u2019ll find that the opportunities to try new delights are endless.\n6. CHERISH THE IRREGULAR CHARACTERISTICS OF TRADITIONAL CHEESES\nA less attractive crust could be hiding a jewel\u00a0!\n7. FAVOR TASTE OVER APPEARANCE\nDon\u2019t hesitate to sample : a taste is worth more than 1000 words...\n8. AVOID STOCKING UP\nHome storage conditions are often unsuitable, and cheese loses its suppleness, aroma, and identity here.By frequently buying smaller amounts, you will ensure yourself that cheese is flavorful and in good condition...\n9. WHILE IN THE STORE, TAKE IN\u2026\n\u2026its history, location, cleanliness, and the arrangment of its cheeses. Enjoy its atmosphere and the range of choices\u2026 Allow yourself to be guided by a team with a passion for taste...\n10. FINALLY\u2026 MAKE THE MOST OUT OF YOUR CHEESE\nWhether a novice, amateur, or expert, learn to make cheese a privileged part of your meal\u00a0: honor it with the appropriate wine, some authentic bread, good conversation, and\u2026 enjoy\u00a0!\n"}], [{"score": 1765.6975, "uuid": "938230cf-e25f-5ae5-90a0-441682383b52", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1103wb-62-09288", "target_hostname": "www.rusticocooking.com", "target_uri": "http://www.rusticocooking.com/cheeses.htm", "page_rank": 1.3465961e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Rustico Cooking - Italian <em>Cheeses</em>", "snippet": "How a given <em>cheese</em> <em>tastes</em> is the result of a number of factors.

Culinary historians postulate that cheese came to be as the result of a happy accident: roughly 12,000 years ago, a nomadic shepherd in the Mediterranean poured the day's milk into a calf's stomach, the pouch he used for transporting goods on his journeys. After a day or so, the shepherd opened the calf's stomach and found that the milk it contained had solidified, forming a spoonable substance. And while that shepherd might have been dismayed by his finding at first, he certainly realized that the milk, in its solidified state, not only tasted good, it kept for longer as well. Thousands of years later, we still use rennet obtained from calf's stomach to separate the whey from the curds in milk; in other words, to make cheese.\nWhile cheesemaking was first developed around the Middle East, as shown by cave paintings in the Libyan Sahara dating to 5000 B.C. and traces of cheese in the tomb of a king of the Egyptian First Dynasty dating to 3000 B.C., all cultures around the Mediterranean basin soon took up the task. Today, Italy is one of the world's leading cheese producers, and boasts a venerable tradition of cheesemaking that predates the days of the Roman Empire. The Etruscans who settled in central Italy more than 3,000 years ago were already making sheep's milk cheese; experts postulate that they grated it over boiled strips of pasta (no, pasta did not reach Italy after Marco Polo went to the Far East: it had been made locally since 1000 B.C. or so), ate it with bread, and more. Both the ancient Greeks and Romans relied on cheese as a staple; again, sheep's milk cheese was most common in these pastoral societies. Homer mentioned cheese in the Iliad, and the Roman cookbook writer Marcus Apicius talked of cheese in his first-century book.\nItaly produces hundreds of different cheeses. Each region relies on its livestock to create a variety of cheeses for the table and for the kitchen. In general, northern Italian regions (Val d'Aosta, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Trentino-Alto Adige, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, The Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna) have a terrain better suited to cows, so most of their cheeses are made of cow's milk. Central Italian regions (The Marches, Tuscany, Umbria, Latium, Abruzzo, and Molise) and southern Italian regions (Apulia, Campania, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicily, and Sardinia) have long been the domain of shepherds, so sheep's milk cheeses prevail. Goat's milk cheeses and cheeses made from the milk of water buffaloes are also made (the latter especially in southern regions). Today, calf's rennet and a variety of vegetable extracts (including wild cardoon) are used to coagulate milk and precipitate the separation of the curds from the whey.\nThe Character of Italian Cheese\nHow a given cheese tastes is the result of a number of factors. First and foremost, of course, is the type of milk used: a cow's milk cheese tastes different from a sheep's milk cheese, and a cheese obtained from a combination of water buffalo's milk and goat's milk has its own personality. The place where the cheese is produced (more on this below), the season in which it is produced, and how long it is aged are also major determinants of flavor: in general, summer cheese tends to be more flavorful, because the animals feed on aromatic fresh grass and wild herbs rather than dry fodder; and the longer a cheese ages, the sharper and saltier it becomes.\nThe place where a given cheese is produced is fundamental to determining its flavor and character. Because Italian dairies tend to process milk only from a delimited, and often quite small, area, the regional specificity of Italian cheeses is quite pronounced. Cows, goats, sheep, and water buffaloes munch on grass and hay in their natural microenvironment; the grass and hay confer a specific taste to the animals' milk, yielding cheeses with unique characteristics. Simply put, cow's milk around Novara (Piedmont), say, tastes different from cow's milk around Bari (Apulia); therefore, a cow's milk Ricotta produced in Novara will taste different from one produced in Bari. This is akin to the soil specificity of grape varietals in winemaking: the same grape varietal planted in two different locations will yield different fruit, and therefore, different wines. Not surprisingly, just as for Italian wine, Italian cheeses are safeguarded and protected by a denomination system: roughly 30 Italian cheeses are now labeled DOP (Denominazione di Origine Protetta, or Denomination of Protected Origin). These DOP cheeses must be made within a given production area according to strict guidelines, and owe much of their character to their place of origin. The DOP cheeses are Italy's most widespread cheeses, and, thankfully, nearly all are available in North America.\nCheese in the Italian Kitchen\nThe Italian word for cheese, formaggio, may be derived from the Latin formaticum (which describes the reed baskets in which curds were set to drain and mature) or from the Greek formos, for shape (meaning the mold used to shape cheese). The texture of cheese depends largely on its water content: the more water is drained out, the drier the cheese will be. Some cheeses, like Crescenza, are runny, almost liquid, while others, particularly the grainy grating cheeses like Grana Padano, are dry and crumbly; of course, the younger, fresher cheeses are moister, and the aged ones are drier and more friable.\nA number of Italian cheeses are best suited to eating at the table, and others are ideal for cooking. But most are versatile enough that they can be savored raw or cooked. Keep in mind that cooking a cheese (or a cured meat such as Prosciutto, for that matter) will tend to attenuate its unique character: if you really want to savor that perfectly aged Robiola, you might be better off eating it with a hunk of country bread than stirring it into a pot of Quattro Formaggi (Four Cheese) sauce for your pasta.\nIn Italy, cheese appears at nearly every meal: sometimes it is served as a course on its own, after the main course in place of dessert; other times it is incorporated in dishes as diverse as pizzas or risottos. Of all Italian cheeses, the most famous is Parmigiano-Reggiano, a crumbly, grainy, nutty-flavored raw cow's milk cheese that hails from Emilia-Romagna; there are few Italian kitchens that don't keep a wedge of this cheese on hand at all times. Mozzarella, Pecorino, Grana Padano, Fontina, Gorgonzola, and Taleggio are also prized across the country. But despite the prevalence of these cheeses across Italy, Italians are fiercely proud of the cheeses crafted in their own villages, towns, and provinces, relying on these less widespread cheeses to create their most characteristic dishes. Locally produced cheeses often lend that haunting, undefinable note to pasta stuffings, fillings or toppings for savory pies, and more. They are an integral, colorful part of the mosaic of the Italian regional kitchen.\nThe list below comprises Italy's most important, as well as most interesting, cheeses. Many of these cheeses are available only in Italy, and some are known only in their zone of production. Make it a point to explore Italy's cheeses both on their native soil and here: in Italy, head to a salumeria (the Italian equivalent of the delicatessen, where cured meats, cheeses, and more are sold) and to the local dairies whenever you can; and at home, take a trip to a well-stocked cheese shop with this list in hand.\nCheese Tips\nSaving Parmigiano Rinds\nItalian cooks are renowned for their ability to make the most of any ingredient: ingenuity and frugality are part and parcel of everyday Italian cooking. So when a chunk of Parmigiano is reduced to little more than the rind, cooks in Italy don't dare throw it away: they drop it into bubbling soups or saucepots, where it releases its delicious, nutty flavor. Only then is the rind discarded... You can save Parmigiano rinds in freezer-safe plastic bags in the freezer for up to 2 months, then drop them into soups or sauces whenever you want to lend your dish a deep, lingering Parmigiano note.\nGrating Cheese Easily\nThere are some fantastic cheese graters out on the market that will help you grate cheese more quickly and efficiently--the Microplane grater immediately comes to mind. But even if you have the best grater in the world, you will have a difficult time grating a soft cheese if it's at room temperature. Keep your cheese in the refrigerator until you're ready to grate it. This is especially important for soft cheeses like Mozzarella and Fontina, which tend to fall apart when too much pressure is applied as they are rubbed against a grater. Another advantage to grating cold cheese is that it \"sweats\" less than warm or room-temperature cheese, making it less slippery and easier to hold in your hands.\nPreventing Mozzarella from Drying Out\nIn Italy, Mozzarella-producers will frown if you eat their creamy, fresh cheese even a day after it's been made: they say (and I agree) that Mozzarella is best savored right after it's been lovingly shaped by hand, and that it loses aroma and becomes drier and stringier with every passing hour. Most gastronomy shops and cheesemongers in Italy sell Mozzarella produced that very day under a sign proclaiming \"Mozzarella del Giorno\" (\"Today's Mozzarella\"). The Mozzarella is sold in plastic bags in which it floats in a lightly salted, briny water solution that prevents it from drying out. And while many North American gourmet stores and specialty shops sell Mozzarella imported from Italy, it's nearly impossible to buy it the same day it's been made: after all, there's an ocean between us and the cheese's homeland. When you purchase imported Italian Mozzarella, ask when it arrived from Italy: if the answer is a week ago, you know it's not worth the price. If possible, ask the cheesemonger to pack it in a container with a little cool salt water for you (unless, of course, it's still in its unopened package, happily floating in salt water). Eat it as soon as you get home, preferably at room temperature, draining it mere minutes before setting it on the table.

In the eighth century B.C.E., Homer mentions cheese in his epic poem, \u201cThe Odyssey.\u201d Olympic athletes grew fleet and brawny on a mostly-cheese diet.\nThe caseale, or cheese kitchen, was a fixture in Roman villas. The Romans enjoyed an enormous selection of cheeses, among them curd, soft, hard, smoked and salted varieties, frequently peppered with a plethora of herbs and spices. Hard cheeses were a Roman export commodity and they comprised, along with crusty bread, a goodly portion of a Roman legionnaire\u2019s daily rations.\nLemon Cheese\nAfter working under small-scale cheese makers in England, France, Holland and Canada, in 1978 Ricki Carroll opened the New England Cheesemaking Supply. Via her website and catalog, Ricki markets supplies and resources gathered from around the globe.\nSome are her own creations: cheese making kits, starters, a CD-ROM and video, and the third printing of Home Cheese Making (considered by many to be the \u201cbible\u201d of home cheese making), first published in 1982 as Cheesemaking Made Easy. The user-friendly paperback is packed with recipes for more than 75 homemade cheeses, plus troubleshooting guides and an extensive resources section.\n\u201cWhen I began making cheese, I was part of a do-it-yourself culture,\u201d says Ricki. \u201cWe were trying to reclaim the self-sufficiency that made our ancestors the independent folks they were. Today cheese making is the new wave. Our workshops are filled and we sponsored a tour of France last October. I field dozens of phone and e-mail questions every day. Anyone, anywhere, can make cheese. We\u2019re here to help them do it.\u201d\nRecipe from Home Cheese Making by Ricki Carroll\u00a0 (Storey Publishing, 2002, with permission). This moist cheese has a spreadable consistency and a mild, lemony flavor.\nIngredients\nJuice of 2 to 3 large lemons or approximately \u00bc cup\nCheese salt (optional)\nHerbs (optional)\nPreparation\nIn a large pot, directly heat the milk to 175 degrees F. Add the juice from two of the lemons and stir well.\nCover and let the milk set for 15 minutes (you are looking for a clear separation of the curds and whey, not milky whey). If the milk has not yet set, add more of the remaining lemon juice until it does set.\nPour the curds into a colander lined with butter muslin. Tie the corners of the butter muslin into a knot and hang the bag to drain for one to two hours, or until the curds have stopped draining.\nRemove the cheese from the bag. Add salt and herbs to taste, if desired.\nStore in a covered container in the refrigerator for one to two weeks.\nYield: About one pound.\nThe first European cheese, quark, is described in records dating to 3 B.C.E. During the Middle Ages monks began perfecting many of the cheeses we know today.\nCheese making is a relatively simple process that involves the curdling of milk to separate curds (those milky white clumps in ricotta and cottage cheeses) and whey (a clear to yellowish, watery fluid used to make whey cheese).\nFollowing a specific recipe is the key, but understanding the basics before getting started will simplify the process for you.\nCheese Classifications\nThe USDA bulletin \u201cCheese Varieties and Descriptions\u201d catalogs 400 varieties of cheese, but far more exist. Cheeses are classified in a number of ways:\n- Fresh: Cottage, Ricotta and farmer cheeses\n- Quick aged: Farmhouse Cheddar, Camembert,\u00a0 Haloumi\n- Aged: Sharp Cheddar, Bleu, Parmesan\n- Cow: Camembert, Gorgonzola, Asiago\n- Sheep: Pecorino Romano, Manchango, Roquefort\n- Water Buffalo: Mozzarella di Bufala, Borelli, Toma\n- Very Soft: Mascarpone, Neufch\u00e2tel, Fromage Blanc\n- Soft: Brie, Limburger, Feta\n- Semisoft: Baby Swiss, Butterkase, Mysost\n- Semihard: Brick, Edam, Gouda\n- Hard: Parmesan, Stilton, Romano\nHowever, classes aren\u2019t carved in stone. Feta can be fashioned of sheep or goat\u2019s milk, Mysost can be soft to semihard. Aging times vary greatly. It depends on who makes the cheese\u2014and that could be you.\nMilk to Use in Cheese\nYou will need milk for all cheese making endeavors. The milk you choose can be homegrown or store-bought, pasteurized and homogenized, or not, whole or skimmed, and the product of cows, goats or sheep.\nCow Milk\nMost cheesemaking recipes assume you\u2019ll use cow milk, but with minor modifications, you can usually substitute goat or sheep milk. Cow milk produces a firm, easy-to-work-with curd. One gallon of cow milk yields roughly two pounds of soft cheese or one pound of hard. And best, it\u2019s readily available.\nGoat Milk\nBecause goat milk is naturally homogenized, goat cheeses are easy to digest. Their tart, tangy flavor is appealing and unique. Goat milk lacks carotene, the substance that gives cow milk its yellow hue, so unless you add coloring, goat cheeses are invariably white. Goat milk curds are delicate, so lower the heat five degrees when using recipes tailored for cow milk. And process goat curds with a gentle hand.\nSheep Milk\nAlthough dairy sheep are scarce in North America, globally that\u2019s not the case. About 100 million sheep (one-tenth of the world\u2019s population) are milked, and much of that milk goes into cheese. The distinctive flavor, texture and aroma of sheep cheese tickles many palates and lactose intolerant cheese aficionados can usually digest sheep-milk cheeses. Because it contains 10 percent less water than goat or cow milk and more than twice the solids, sheep milk yields up to two and one-half times more cheese than its competitors. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have sheep milk to use in cow-milk recipes, add three to five times less rennet and only half the recommended salt.\nRaw Milk\nRaw milk purchased at natural food stores has been filtered and cooled, but not pasteurized. It is higher in vitamin content and considerably more flavorful than processed milk. The bad news: raw milk can harbor tuberculosis, brucellosis and salmonella bacteria. Only raw milk from tested animals should be used in cheese making.\nPasteurized Milk\nFrom Home Cheese Making by Ricki Carroll\n(Storey Publishing, 2002, with permission).\nThe following recipe is a quick and easy way to make fresh Mozzarella at home in less than 30 minutes. Make sure the milk you use for this cheese is NOT ultrapasteurized, otherwise you will end up with Ricotta instead of Mozzarella.\nIngredients\n2 level teaspoons citric acid\n1 gallon pasteurized whole milk (see Note in Step 1 below)\n? - \u00bc teaspoon lipase powder (see Note in Step 1 below), dissolved in \u00bc cup cool water and allowed to sit for 20 minutes, for a stronger flavor (optional)\n\u00bc teaspoon liquid rennet (or \u00bc rennet tablet) diluted in\u00a0\u00bc cup cool, unchlorinated water\n1 teaspoon cheese salt (optional)\nPreparation\nAdd the citric acid to the milk and stir thoroughly. (If using lipase, add it now) Note: You may use skim milk, but the yield will be lower and the cheese will be drier. If you add lipase to this cheese, you may have to use a bit more rennet, as lipase makes the cheese softer. Try the recipe without it and experiment later.\nHeat the milk to 88 degrees F. (The milk will start to curdle)\nGently stir in the diluted rennet with an up-and-down motion, and continue heating until the temperature reaches 105 degrees F. Turn off the heat and let the curd set until you get a clean break when you insert the thermometer at a 45 degree angle. This will take only a few minutes.\nThe curd should look like thick yogurt. If the whey is still milky, wait a few more minutes.\nScoop out the curds with a slotted spoon and put them into a two-quart microwave-safe bowl. Press the curds gently with your hands, pouring off as much whey as possible. Reserve the whey.\nMicrowave the curds on high for one minute. More whey will precipitate from the curd. Again, drain off all excess whey. Quickly work the cheese with a spoon or your hands, forming it into a ball until it is cool enough to touch. (Wear rubber gloves; the cheese has to be almost too hot to touch before it will stretch.)\nMicrowave two more times for 35 seconds each. After each heating, work the cheese into a ball until it is cool enough to touch. Drain all excess whey each time.\nKnead quickly like bread dough until it is smooth. Sprinkle on the salt, if desired, while you are kneading and stretching. When the cheese stretches like taffy, it is done. If it breaks, the curds will need to be reheated.\nWhen the cheese is smooth and shiny, it is ready to eat. Although this mozzarella is best eaten right away, if you must wait, cover it and store in the refrigerator.\nYield: \u00be to one pound\nTip: For a firmer cheese, use more rennet. If your cheese is too hard, use less rennet. If the curds turn into the consistency of ricotta cheese and will not come together, change the brand of milk; it may have been heat-treated at the factory to too high a temperature. Most of all, be patient. When you get this to work, you will never stop eating it.\nPasteurized milk is heat-treated to zap those nasty bacteria. The process robs milk of flavor and makes its vitamins, milk sugars and proteins harder to digest. Still, pasteurized milk is undoubtedly a safer product. Supermarket milk is pasteurized and homogenized. It\u2019s heat-treated and pressurized to thwart cream separation. Store-bought milk yields a smoother, looser curd than home-produced milks, but adding calcium chloride makes it handle more like unpasteurized milk. Worth noting: it takes up to twice as much rennet to curdle homogenized cow milk, so start with the recommended amount and gradually add more solution until those reluctant curds appear.\nWhole Milk\nWhole milk boasts three and a half to four percent butterfat; its cream content is intact. Hard cheeses made from high-fat milk are generally softer than skim milk varieties but their \u201cmouth feel\u201d is superbly rich and silky.\nSkim Milk\nSkimmed milk contains zero to two percent butterfat. It\u2019s fine for making reduced-fat and soft cheeses. Hard grating cheeses like parmesan and romano are always fashioned from partially skimmed milk. You can enrich seven pints of homogenized fresh or reconstituted skim milk with a pint of heavy cream to recreate raw milk\u2019s great taste and its easier cheese making properties.\nRegardless of the type of milk you choose, make certain it\u2019s fresh. Don\u2019t crack the container until you\u2019re ready to begin. Rancid or \u201cbarn-yardy\u201d milks never make tasty cheese.\nCheese-making Supplies\nAcidifier\nBesides the milk, to make cheese you\u2019ll need an acidifier to convert milk sugar to lactic acid and \u201cripen\u201d your milk. This can be something as simple as lemon juice or as technical as the special bacterial starter cultures purchased from a cheese-making supplier. Freeze-dried direct-set cultures are a snap to use\u2014pour them directly from the packet into your milk\u2014and they stay fresh in a freezer as long as two years.\nRennet\nNext, you\u2019ll need rennet, the enzyme that separates milk into curds and whey. Nearly all cheese making recipes call for rennet. In olden days, cheese makers soaked a scrap of the fourth stomach of a newborn calf or kid in warm brine to create rennet. Although animal rennets are still used, vegetable rennets work equally well. Rennet can be purchased as liquid, tablets and powder. Liquid rennet must be refrigerated, and the others require freezing. Rennet should be measured carefully and diluted in 20 to 50 times its measure of cool, unchlorinated water. The solution should be allowed to age for 20 minutes before using. You can purchase rennet from cheese making suppliers and at natural food stores. \u201cJunket\u201d is a mild rennet sometimes found in grocery stores alongside packaged puddings. In a pinch, it can be used in soft cheese recipes, substituting four or five Junket tablets for each one of commercial rennet.\nCitric Acid\nFor fashioning mozzarella you\u2019ll need citric acid. If you savor tangier cheeses, add lipase powder too. Some pharmacies carry citric acid, and because it\u2019s also used to acidify home-canned tomatoes, you can sometimes find it in grocery or hardware store home-canning displays.\nSalt\nCoarse, non-iodized cheese salt draws moisture from curd, hastens aging and imparts considerable flavor. Iodized salts won\u2019t do; iodine inhibits starter growth and slows the aging process. Non-iodized pickling and crystal kosher salts work well if you can find them.\nFlavorings\nFresh herbs are a traditional flavoring for soft cheeses. If you like, fold in garlic, scallions, chives, horseradish, oregano, sage, dill, basil, parsley, thyme or caraway (alone or in combination) to your recipe. Other possibilities are bacon crumbles and small fruits like blueberries and sliced strawberries. For optimal flavor, age seasoned cheeses in the fridge for a day or two before sampling.\nOther Supplies\nYou\u2019ll also need a stainless steel, enamelware or glass pot large enough to hold a gallon of milk; a two-quart glass bowl; metal measuring and slotted stirring spoons; a colander; butter muslin (if you need to, substitute many layers of grocery store cheesecloth or a single layer of linen or nylon tricot fabric); a cheese-making thermometer (that registers 60 to 220 degrees F); and possibly heavy rubber gloves.\nCleanliness: A\u00a0Must in Cheese Making\nThe golden rule of cheese making: Clean it and keep it clean. Immerse your bowl and utensils in boiling water for at least five minutes before and after every cheese-making session. Swab your work area with a clean cloth dipped in a solution of two tablespoons household bleach to one gallon of water. Wash your hands carefully and often. Don\u2019t let stray bacteria spoil your cheese.\nKits are a Good Way to Get Started\nThe easiest way to get started making cheese is with a kit that simply requires the addition of milk. The New England Cheesemaking Supply, Glenngarry Cheesemaking and Dairy Supply, and Leener\u2019s Brew Works (See \u201cCheese Making Supplies\u201d at right for contact information) all sell a variety of kits designed with the novice in mind.\nMarketing Information\nA not-to-be-missed, extensive report prepared for the North Central Initiative for Small Farm Profitability.\nMarketing Farmstead Cheeses\nVisit the University of Wisconsin-Extension and search \u201ccheese\u201d for information on marketing your product.\n"}, {"score": 1747.8722, "uuid": "0d0dd4c8-996c-54cf-ad0e-8ec0e7cdd6a4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0105wb-60-22777", "target_hostname": "www.cheesemonthclub.com", "target_uri": "http://www.cheesemonthclub.com/pastnewsletters/vol10no11.htm", "page_rank": 1.1786184e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Gourmet <em>Cheese</em> of the Month Club - <em>Cheese</em> Club", "snippet": "These days, Double Glouster and Cotswold are made in both <em>pasteurized</em> and <em>unpasteurized</em> varieties.

Covering over 1,025 square miles, it\u2019s known for its natural beauty and boasts the agricultural industries of farming, forestry and horticulture. With a total population of about 570,000, Gloucestershire County consists of three geographic areas, the Cotswolds, the Royal Forest of Dean and the Severn Vale. English Cotswold cheese, a variation of \"Double Glouster\", was originally made from the rich milk of the black cattle of Glouster and traditionally made in the Cotswolds. English Cotswold is a mix of chopped chives and onion, coupled with a quality Double Gloucester cheese. This smooth, cheddary delight is a modern rendition of an old British favorite which lacked the vegetable component. It is similar to cheddar but this cheese is aged for just three to four months so it\u2019s milder, less sharp and less firm than a well-aged cheddar. As does cheddar, it melts well and is often served melted on slices of bread. It is golden yellow to orange in color.\nThese days, Double Glouster and Cotswold are made in both pasteurized and unpasteurized varieties. Like most hard cheeses, this cheese can be stored for at least a month in the refrigerator so you needn't be in a hurry to finish it off, though we suspect you just might after you taste it. In Britain, Cotswold is known as \"Pub Cheese,\" so fetch your beer mugs and have them at the ready! Your Cotswold comes from the Clawson dairy and is a long-standing member of the Clawson product line. You can find a recipe for Cotswold Wraps at http://www.clawson.co.uk/recipes/cotswold-wraps/ .\nTasting Notes: The harmonious blend of mellow cheese and powerful vegetables makes Cotswold a terrific complement to the softer, milder flavors on your cheese board. A simple preparation called \"the ploughman's lunch\" is easily the most universal of British pub snacks. It consists of a cut of a hard cheese, a home-baked bread roll, pickled onions and a pint of beer. The classic ploughman's is served with a generous slice of farmhouse Cheddar, but different pubs offer different cheeses to round out the meal. We encourage you to try making your own ploughman's lunch by pairing your cheese with hard-crusted bread and strong dark ale.\nDanish Havarti\nA rare luxury in the United States, Havarti is an interior-ripened cheese with a very creamy texture and, not surprisingly, a creamy, buttery flavor. It has a smooth surface with no rind and a springy, elastic, semi-firm texture which makes it ideal for slicing. The flesh is usually cream-colored to pale yellow, and heavily pocked with holes\u2014small, irregular openings called \"eyes.\u201d If eaten young, the cheese is often considered to be somewhat lacking in flavor but if allowed to age, the cheese attains a subtle, slightly acidic flavor which is delightful. Stronger varieties can be somewhat sharp, slightly resembling Swiss cheese. Typically, Havarti is aged about three months. When the cheese is older it becomes more salty and has a slight hazelnut flavor. At room temperature the cheese will soften quickly.\nHanne Nielsen is the enterprising cheesemaker credited with inventing Havarti in the mid 1800s. The wife of a New Zealand farmer, Nielsen became interested in the art of cheesemaking and so she traveled throughout Europe to learn techniques and trade secrets. Upon her return to Denmark, Nielsen experimented with her newly acquired knowledge, producing many cheeses. Her finest creation was an original washed curd cheese she named \"Havarthi,\" after her farm. The Havarti you\u2019re receiving is a direct descendent of Nielsen's creation\u2014produced and aged to perfection based on the original recipe.\nHavarti is often used in place of stronger cheeses like Gouda and Emmentaler, when the taste of a cheese is desired without a strong flavor. The cheese comes in low fat versions as well as an enriched full cream type, which tends to melt in the mouth. Enriched Havarti can sometimes be intensely cloying, with the heavy creamy texture, and should be used sparingly or in a strong dish which is capable of handling the heavy flavor. As with most semi-soft cheeses, Havarti will keep for at least two weeks stored in the least cold section of the refrigerator (usually the vegetable drawer). Once opened, carefully re-wrap Havarti with aluminum foil, plastic wrap or better yet, parchment paper.\nTasting Notes: Havarti has a mild flavor similar to a Monterey Jack. Slightly acidic, the taste is buttery and ranges from somewhat sweet to very sweet. It often appears on sandwiches, in fondue and on salads. Its piquant flavor makes it a wonderful table cheese that is appreciated by the youngest of children and cheese connoisseurs alike. Havarti is often served with fruit and crackers and it pairs well with many wines. It\u2019s an extremely versatile cheese. Use it cubed in salads, melted in sauces, on potatoes or on hamburgers. And, it has the added value of marrying perfectly with a clean, crisp Danish pilsner! \u00a0Consider the following for your Thanksgiving Day.\nHavarti Cheese Ball Recipe\n8 ounces cream cheese, softened\n1/2 cup shredded Havarti cheese\n1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese\n1 tablespoon dry white wine or milk\n3/4 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano (1/4 tsp dry)\n2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley\n2 medium green onions, finely chopped\n2 tablespoons finely chopped red bell peppers\ncrackers for serving\nBeat cheeses, wine, oregano and green onion in medium bowl with electric mixer on low speed until blended. Beat on medium speed, scraping bowl frequently, until fluffy. Cover and refrigerate about 2 hours or until firm enough to shape. Then shape cheese mixture into a ball; roll in parsley and bell pepper. Serve with crackers. Makes 1 3/4 cups.\nWrapped tightly in plastic wrap, you can freeze your cheese ball for up to two months so consider doubling the recipe and you will have a delicious appetizer for the upcoming December holidays. To serve from freezer, unwrap cheese ball and let stand at room temp to thaw, or thaw loosely wrapped in refrigerator at least 8 hours. Refrigerate, tightly covered, up to one week.\nSaga Gorgonzola Blue\nNo, this saga is not a prose narrative written in Iceland between 1120 and 1400 dealing with the families that first settled Iceland and their descendants. Nor is it a history of the kings of Norway or the myths and legends of early Germanic gods and heroes. Our saga is a wonderful culinary delight you\u2019ll be proud to share this holiday season. It\u2019s smoother, creamier and milder than a typical blue so even folks who think they don\u2019t like blue cheeses because they\u2019re \u201ctoo strong\u201d may find themselves craving more. The cheese we bring you is produced by a blue-cheese only manufacturer in Mindoro, Wisconsin that was specifically selected and then trained by Danes to make a product the way generations of their ancestors have.\nTasting Notes: Saga Blue has a delicate blue cheese flavor and a softer\u2014almost spreadable\u2014texture than a typical Danish style blue cheese. The cheese is great in salads and as a snack cheese. As mentioned earlier, Saga Blue can be a great transition cheese for lovers of milder cheeses who have yet to learn to appreciate the stronger blue cheeses. It is an excellent cheese in salads; consider blending it into a vinaigrette salad dressing. Serve it with crackers as an appetizer. It\u2019s also an excellent dessert cheese that should be served with fruit or even bubbly\u2014after all, it is the holiday season.

Trying to recreate their own beloved Gouda, the cheese became infected with molds, yeasts, and bacteria while being aged in a damp cellar. Thus Tilsit, also known as Tilsit Havarti, was born. Although similar, this Danish cheese has a fuller and more intense flavor than the regular Havarti. Having a brownish-orange washed rind and made of partially skimmed milk, this exquisite cheese has a rich yellow color with a springy elastic semi-firm texture, making it ideal for slicing. Danish Tilsit also has a piquant flavor lending it nicely as a wonderful table cheese. Extremely versatile, Tilsit can be cubed in salads, melted in sauces, on potatoes, flans, or on burgers. And, it has the added value of marrying perfectly with a clean, crisp Danish pilsner!\nTasting notes: Havarti is a Dutch cheese, and is similar to a Monterey Jack. It has a lot of \"eyes\" (tiny holes) throughout the cheese, and a soft almost springy texture. Havarti has a mild flavor, and is great to use in a variety of ways. It works in salads, sandwiches, omelets and can even be sliced and fried! It's named after the farm in Denmark where it was first created, and is one of the most accessible cheeses in the world\nSaga\nNo, this is not a prose narrative usually written in Iceland between 1120 and 1400, dealing with the families that first settled Iceland and their descendants, with the histories of the kings of Norway, and with the myths and legends of early Germanic gods and heroes. Rather, a wonderful culinary delight we're pleased to introduce to you.\nSaga is a blue veined cheese, originally made in Denmark. It's essentially a cross between a blue mold cheese and a brie, so it has a delicate blue cheese flavor, with a quite soft and almost spreadable texture. It's great in salads and as a snack cheese, and is a really nice introduction to blue cheeses due to its mild flavor.\nTasting Notes: Saga is an excellent dessert cheese that should be served with fruit and wine. It is also an excellent cheese in salads or as a snack on a cracker.\nCheese and Beer - A Match Made in Heaven\nCheese and Beer? The idea of the twosome is hard for many to swallow when in fact the mix of cheese and beer goes way, way back. In Belgium, during the Dark Ages, monasteries were famous for their exceptional beers and cheeses - part of their daily diets and a stable form of income. Today most bars in Belgium will serve bowls of cubed, semi-soft cheese that has been sprinkled with celery salt to accompany your malt beverage. It is a melding of a gastronomic sensation of heavenly proportions.\nAnd we bet you thought wine went with cheese. It sure does, and that's exactly what the public is fed by the mainstream \"food & wine\" press. Cheese can make an unpalatable wine tasteful, and better yet, complement a great wine. However the pairing of wine with foods sometimes tends to overpower the latter, killing any chance your taste buds might have of getting the fullest enjoyment out of the pairing. But hey, this is not a piece on wine (and we all love wine) so let's move on.\nGenerally, beer and cheese are farmhouse products. Not too long ago in Great Britain, the average farmer's diet consisted of cheese, beer and cold meat - this commonly referred to as \"ploughman's lunch\" still a menu item in pubs to this day. The farmers produced cheese when they had a surplus of milk that they wanted to keep, and then they brewed their beer in the winter when they couldn't farm. Both come from the same source too - grass. Barley, used in making beer, is a grass and milk is a byproduct of a cow eating grass. The result? Cheese and beer complement each other because they share some of the same flavors. The carbonation in beer also lifts the palate and brings out many nuances in the cheese.\nSo, just how do you pair cheese and beer? Foremost is using your own personal preference whether you are cooking with cheese or just serving it alone. Try pairing complex cheeses with complex beers. You can also try and make a perfect match or play around and make nuanced contrasts. Here are some examples:\nWheat Beers work well with Feta and goat cheese. Generally, the more pungent the cheese the more full character you want in your Wheat Beer. Schneider Hefe-Weizen, Weihenstephan Hefe-Weizen, and UFO Hefeweizen are suitable pairings.\nA formless cow's cream, cheese called Mascarpone that is used in desserts and sauces pairs great with most Fruit Beers. Sam Adams Cherry Wheat, Magic Hat #9, Melbourne Bros. Strawberry or Apricot.\nMuenster, American cheese, Havarti and Monterey Jack go great with moderately hoppy Pilsners like Radeberger, Harpoon Pilsner and Stella Artios.\nGloucester, Colby and Cheddar with robust Brown Ales. Sam Smith Nut Brown, Shipyard Brown or Brooklyn Brown will suffice quite well.\nCreamy Blues and Gorgonzola meld beautifully with Barleywines. Fuller's Vintage Ale, Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, Brooklyn Monster and Rouge Old Crustacean make for a great counterpart.\nStilton and Roquefort and have a pungent character so there is need for a strong Belgian Ale like Duvel, Lucifer, Northcoast Pranqster, Chimay Blue, and Unibroue Don de Dieu.\nEmmental, Gruy\u00e9re and Swiss with Dark Lagers, Bock Beer, or Oktoberfest Beer. Their sizable maltiness fits well against the nutlike meaty character. Harpoon Octoberfest or Munich Dark, Sam Adams Octoberfest or Double Bock, Salavator, Celebrator and Dornbusch Bock are appropriate choices.\nRomano or Parmesan with moderately hoppy Amber Ales and Pale Ales like Stone Cat Ale, Harpoon Ale, Ipswich Ale, Magic Hat Bob's 1st Ale, Shoal's Pale Ale.\nWhen the cheese is part of a salad, try enjoying it with an India Pale Ale (IPA), with their fruity maltiness and citrus-like bitterness. Wolaver's IPA, Harpoon IPA and Tremont IPA are all suitable.\nNow because we're not all connoisseurs who have this stuff down by heart, we've created a simple guide. It's an ideal starting point for the novice cheese and beer enthusiast.\nParmesan with Amber Lager\n"}, {"score": 1724.8223, "uuid": "15810ed6-4044-5aea-bd5f-8bae2bf52d33", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0105wb-44-13476", "target_hostname": "www.cheesemonthclub.com", "target_uri": "http://www.cheesemonthclub.com/pastnewsletters/vol8no11.htm", "page_rank": 1.1786184e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "Gourmet <em>Cheese</em> of the Month Club - <em>Cheese</em> Club", "snippet": "These days, Double Glouster, and thus, Cotswold, is made in both <em>pasteurized</em> and <em>unpasteurized</em> varieties.

Covering over 1,025 square miles, it is known for its natural beauty with agricultural industries in farming, forestry and horticulture and wool. Geographically, it splits into three areas, the Cotswolds, the Royal Forest of Dean and the Severn Vale with a total population of about 570,000.\nEnglish Cotswold cheese, a variation of \"Double Glouster\", was originally made from the rich milk of the black cattle of Glouster and traditionally made in Glouchestershire, in the Cotswolds. A classic blend of chopped chives and onion, coupled with a quality Double Gloucester cheese, this cheddary and smooth delight is a modern rendition of an old British favorite (which lacked the vegetable component). It is similar to cheddar, however, this firm cheese is aged for three to four months, so it is not as hard and is actually milder and less sharp. It melts well, similarly to cheddar, and is often served melted on slices of bread. It is golden yellow to orange in color.\nThese days, Double Glouster, and thus, Cotswold, is made in both pasteurized and unpasteurized varieties. Like most hard cheeses, this cheese can be stored for at least a month in the refrigerator, so you needn't be in a hurry to finish it off, though we suspect you just might after you taste it.\nCotswold is known in Britain as \"Pub Cheese,\" so fetch your beer mugs and have them at the ready!\nYour Cotswold comes from the Clawson dairy and is a long-standing member of the Clawson product line. See the Clawson recipes for Cotswold cheeses at http://www.clawson.co.uk/recipes.asp .\nTasting Notes: The harmonious blend of mellow cheese and powerful vegetables makes Cotswold a terrific complement to the softer, milder flavors on your cheese board. A simple preparation called \"the ploughman's lunch\" is easily the most universal of British pub snacks. It consists of a cut of Cheese, a home-baked bread roll, pickled onions and a pint of beer. The classic ploughman's is served with a generous slice of farmhouse Cheddar, but different pubs offer different cheeses to round out the meal. We encourage you to try making your own ploughman's lunch by pairing your cheese with hard-crusted bread and strong dare ale.\nHavarti\nA rare luxury in the United States, Havarti is a surface-ripened cheese originally made in the mid-19th Century by Dutch settlers in East Prussia near the town of Tilsit. Trying to recreate their own beloved Gouda, the cheese became infected with molds, yeasts, and bacteria while being aged in a damp cellar. Thus Tilsit, also known as Tilsit Havarti, was born. Although similar, this Danish cheese has a fuller and more intense flavor than the regular Havarti. Having a brownish-orange washed rind and made of partially skimmed milk, this exquisite cheese has a rich yellow color with a springy elastic semi-firm texture, making it ideal for slicing. Danish Tilsit also has a piquant flavor lending it nicely as a wonderful table cheese. Extremely versatile, Tilsit can be cubed in salads, melted in sauces, on potatoes, flans, or on burgers. And, it has the added value of marrying perfectly with a clean, crisp Danish pilsner!\nTasting notes: Havarti is a Dutch cheese, and is similar to a Monterey Jack. It has a lot of \"eyes\" (tiny holes) throughout the cheese, and a soft almost springy texture. Havarti has a mild flavor, and is great to use in a variety of ways. It works in salads, sandwiches, omelets and can even be sliced and fried!

As you become more skilled and knowledgeable, you may well want to purchase more specific ingredients from the web (etc) to refine your procedures and finished products.\nThe projects are listed in order of increasing difficulty .\u00a0 You are more likely to succeed if you work your way through each one rather than jump immediately to a more challenging cheese.\u00a0 (I know--everyone wants to jump straight to making a blue cheese, or a brie...)\nA DISCUSSION OF INGREDIENTS AND EQUIPMENT:\nINGREDIENTS:\nMilk:\nYou can use a wide variety of milks, from commercially purchased pasteurized homogenized cow's milk, TB certified raw cow's milk, goat's milk, sheep or even horse's milk.\u00a0 All will make cheese, each with its unique flavor.\u00a0 Cheese from unpasteurized milk makes the best cheese, but should be cured for 2-4 months if there is any doubt about pathogens in the milk.\u00a0 If you use pasteurized milk, you may need to add a little calcium chloride to firm up the curd because the heat makes the calcium unavailable.\u00a0 Calcium is required for a good \"clean break.\" ( see below ).\nCheese can be made from whole milk (3.5%), 2% or from skimmed milk.\u00a0 However, remember that the richness of flavor of the cheese is related to the amount of butterfat in the milk.\u00a0 I do not recommend reconstituted powdered milk .\u00a0 It has not produced either a solid clean break, nor a good flavor of cheese.\u00a0 Let me know if you do.\nYou should\u00a0 get\u00a0 1 to 1.5 pounds of cheese/gallon of milk.\nFor store-bought milk, because Pasteurization removes calcium from solution, you may need to add a small amount of calcium chloride to aid coagulation and form curd which does not fall apart when you stir it. The desired concentration of CaCl2 is usually specified as 0.02%. This would mean adding 3.6g CaCl2 to 5 gal of pasteurized milk. My measurements indicate that 3.6g of crystals = ~3/4 tsp. Thus 3/4 tsp crystals/5 gal = ~0.02%. You should completely dissolve the CaCl2 in about 1/4 cup water before adding it to the milk. Add it slowly with thorough stirring.\u00a0 You should be able to purchase CaCl2 at brewer's supply house.\u00a0 Also, it is the non-NaCl deicer that is plant-friendly.\u00a0 [You might be able to use CaSO4 (plaster of Paris) in a highly diluted state, tho it is much less soluble than CaCl2.]\nReconstituted powdered milk: I have not had good luck using powdered milk, but have heard some say that they have successfully used it.\u00a0 I suggest you make friends with a local dairy person to get bulk milk.\u00a0 (You will have better luck getting milk from homesteaders than with commercial operators.\u00a0 Legally, you must purchase it as \"pet milk.\")\nUltrapasterurized milk: This is common on the shelves in Europe, but I find it VERY unsatisfying in taste, and, in my opinion, this milk is nearly worthless in making basic cheese. The protein strucure is radically altered, and calcium is chelated so that it is unavailable for coagulation. If you have success with ultrapasterized milk, let us know! (You CAN use it to make yogurt and labneh.)\nStarter:\nBacteria must be added to acidify the milk so that the rennet will work, and to aid in the curing.\u00a0 Cultured buttermilk can serve as a mesophilic starter (it likes room temperature), and yogurt can serve as a thermophilic starter (it prefers warmer temperatures).\u00a0 You can also purchase pure cultures from cheese makers supply houses . Some recipes call for addition of chemical acids to produce acidify the milk.\u00a0 I prefer the flavor of cheese made from bacterially acidified milk.\u00a0 Here is a detailed description of bacterial cheese starters from Peter Moller. Be aware that, especially with buttermilk, you should never add too much starter for too long a time such that the milk has even remotely thickened before you add rennet. With even slightly thickened milk, you will never get a \"clean break.\"\nRennet:\nAn enzyme rennin converts milk protein (casein) from a soluble to an insoluble material, causing the milk to gel (forming a clean break).\u00a0 It will only work well in acidified milk.\u00a0 The gelling process must be undisturbed to get a clean break.\u00a0 Rennet is commonly available in supermarkets in the pudding section, or you can purchase liquid rennet from a cheese makers supply house. One tablet of Junket rennet is equivalent to 20 drops of fresh liquid rennet.\nIf you would like to try it, and have the materials available, I have successfully prepared home made rennet from the abomasum of a suckling kid.\nEQUIPMENT:\nMost decently equipped kitchens have the necessary equipment:\nHeavy stainless steel pot with lid: A non-reactive pot is important because the acidifying milk can dissolve aluminum.\u00a0 Enamel pots would work as well.\u00a0 A heavy bottom is important to evenly disperse the heat and prevent scorching.\u00a0 Scorching affects the flavor and is a cleanup hassle.\u00a0 The size of the pot should be large enough so that you have at least an inch of head space above the milk.\u00a0 A cover is needed for the steps when the milk must sit for periods of time.\u00a0 I bought a high quality five gallon pot like this years ago (expensive).\u00a0 I have never been sorry.\nMeasuring cups You may need measuring cups ranging from 1/4 cup to a quart.\u00a0 Obviously you can improvise, but accurate measurements improve your success rate.\u00a0 Measuring spoons are occasionally needed.\nThermometer An accurate thermometer which reads in the range of 32-225 F (0-100 C) is very important.\u00a0 A candy or meat thermometer can work.\u00a0 There are several reasons that accurate temperature is important: the texture of the cheese depends a great deal on achieving a temperature to within one degree.\u00a0 Also, after milk for yogurt is scalded, it must be cooled to 130 F for optimum bacteria action.\nWhisk Thorough mixing of starter and rennet is important.\u00a0 A whisk is the obvioius choice for this step.\n\"Cheese cloth\": The purpose of \"cheese cloth\" is to catch the curd and allow the whey to drain out.\u00a0 What most people think of as \"cheese cloth:\" the very wide weave flimsy material is often useless for this purpose.\u00a0 If your curd is fine, it passes through.\u00a0 Even if it is large curd, the curd can become enmeshed in the coarse weave.\u00a0 I use either large plain white cotton handkercheifs, or white non-terry cotton dish towels.\u00a0 I recommend ignoring what is sold as \"cheese cloth...\"\nCheese press is required for the hard cheeses.\u00a0 You can purchase them for a handsome price, or fashion one from materials at home .\nWaxing your cheese: This step is important so that your cheese does not dry out during aging, and to prevent mold from growing on the surface (mold nees air to grow). Here are the steps to wax your cheese.\nA SYLLABUS FOR A CHEESE MAKING COURSE:\nTry these recipes in the order given for optimum success.\nYogurt is an excellent starting point because you master proper handling of milk, good aseptic technique with the starter and proper temperature control.\u00a0 You will use heat-loving bacteria to produce this famous healthful food.\nButtermilk is even easier, but teaches you fewer skills of cheese making.\n"}, {"score": 1720.2341, "uuid": "31974308-94db-5d2d-b399-39e573165423", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-52-10433", "target_hostname": "www.cdc.gov", "target_uri": "http://www.cdc.gov/Features/RawMilk/index.html", "page_rank": 1.1747497e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "CDC Features - Raw (<em>Unpasteurized</em>) Milk", "snippet": "[PODCAST \u00e2\u0080\u0093 5:28 minutes]&quot;, to learn about the risks associated with drinking <em>unpasteurized</em> (raw) milk * Visit FDA&#x27;s The Dangers of Raw Milk: <em>Unpasteurized</em> Milk Can Pose a Serious Health Risk, FDA Federal Registry: <em>Cheeses</em> and Related <em>Cheese</em> Products CDC works 24&#x2F;7 saving lives, protecting people from", "explanation": null, "document": "Features by Date\nRaw (Unpasteurized) Milk\nRaw milk can carry harmful germs that can make you very sick or kill you. If you're thinking about drinking raw milk because you believe it has health benefits, consider other options.\nTrying to decide about raw milk?\nDeveloping a healthy lifestyle is a process with many decisions and steps. One step you might be thinking about is adding raw milk to your diet. Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful germs. Germs include bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It's important to understand the risks of drinking raw milk, especially because you may be hearing claims about the supposed \"benefits\" of raw milk.\nRaw milk contains bacteria, and some of them can be harmful. So, if you're thinking about consuming raw milk because you believe that it is a good source of beneficial bacteria, you need to know that it isn't and you may instead get sick from the harmful bacteria. If you think that certain types of bacteria may be beneficial to your health, consider getting them from foods that don't involve such a high risk. For example, so-called probiotic bacteria are sometimes added to pasteurized fermented foods, such as yogurt and kefir.\nMilk and products made from milk need minimal processing, called pasteurization, which can be done by heating the milk briefly (for example, heating it to 161\u00b0F for about 20 seconds). When milk is pasteurized, some bacteria remain in it, but the disease-causing ones are killed. Harmful germs usually don't change the look, taste, or smell of milk, so only when milk has been pasteurized can you be confident that these germs are not present. To ensure that milk is safe, processors rapidly cool it after pasteurization, practice sanitary handling, and store milk in clean, closed containers at 45\u00b0F or below.\nRemember, you can't look at, smell, or taste a bottle of raw milk and tell if it's safe to drink. Make the best decision for the health of your family. If you want to keep milk in your family's diet, protect them by not giving them raw milk. Even healthy adults can get sick from drinking raw milk. If you're thinking about drinking raw milk because you believe it has health benefits, consider other options.\nWho is at greatest risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk?\nThe risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk is greater for infants and young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer, an organ transplant, or HIV/AIDS, than it is for healthy school-aged children and adults. But, it is important to remember that healthy people of any age can get very sick or even die if they drink raw milk contaminated with harmful germs.\nWhat are the risks associated with drinking raw milk?\nRaw milk can carry harmful bacteria and other germs that can make you very sick or kill you. While it is possible to get foodborne illnesses from many different foods, raw milk is one of the riskiest of all.\nGetting sick from raw milk can mean many days of diarrhea, stomach cramping, and vomiting. Less commonly, it can mean kidney failure, paralysis, chronic disorders, and even death.\nMany people who chose raw milk thinking they would improve their health instead found themselves (or their loved ones) sick in a hospital for several weeks fighting for their lives from infections caused by germs in raw milk. For example, a person can develop severe or even life-threatening diseases, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, which can cause paralysis, and hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result in kidney failure and stroke.\nAren't raw or natural foods better than processed foods?\nMany people believe that foods with no or minimal processing are better for their health. Many people also believe that small, local farms are better sources of healthy food. However, some types of processing are needed to protect health. For example, consumers process raw meat, poultry, and fish for safety by cooking. Similarly, when milk is pasteurized, it is heated just long enough to kill disease-causing germs. Most nutrients remain after milk is pasteurized. There are many local, small farms that offer pasteurized organic milk and cheese products.\nI've heard that many organic and raw milk producers are creating sanitary and humane conditions for raising animals and producing \"safe\" raw milk and raw milk products (like cheeses and yogurts). Does this help reduce milk contamination?\nAdherence to good hygienic practices during milking can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of milk contamination. The dairy farm environment is a reservoir for illness-causing germs. No matter what precautions farmers take, and even if their raw milk tests come back negative, they cannot guarantee that their milk, or the products made from their milk, are free of harmful germs.\nGerms such as Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, and Salmonella can contaminate milk during the process of milking dairy animals, including cows, sheep, and goats. Animals that carry these germs usually appear healthy.\nHow does milk get contaminated?\nMilk contamination may occur from:\nCow feces coming into direct contact with the milk\nInfection of the cow's udder (mastitis)\nCow diseases (e.g., bovine tuberculosis)\nBacteria that live on the skin of cows\nEnvironment (e.g., feces, dirt, processing equipment)\nInsects, rodents, and other animal vectors\nHumans, for example, by cross-contamination from soiled clothing and boots\nPasteurization is the only way to kill many of the bacteria in milk that can make people very sick.\nInformation about raw milk-related outbreaks\nStates that allow the legal sale of raw milk for human consumption have more raw milk-related outbreaks of illness than states that do not allow raw milk to be sold legally.\nAmong dairy product-associated outbreaks reported to CDC between 1973 and 2009 in which the investigators reported whether the product was pasteurized or raw, 82% were due to raw milk or cheese. From 1998 through 2009, 93 outbreaks due to consumption of raw milk or raw milk products were reported to CDC. These resulted in 1,837 illnesses, 195 hospitalizations, and 2 deaths. Most of these illnesses were caused by Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, or Salmonella. It is important to note that a substantial proportion of the raw milk-associated disease burden falls on children; among the 93 raw dairy product outbreaks from 1998 to 2009, 79% involved at least one person younger than 20 years old.\nA study released by CDC in February 2012 examined the number of dairy outbreaks in the United States during a 13\u00e2\u0080\u0090year period. Between 1993 and 2006, 60% (73/121) of dairy-related outbreaks reported to CDC were linked to raw milk products. Three\u00e2\u0080\u0090quarters of these outbreaks occurred in states where the sale of raw milk was legal at the time. Experts also found that those sickened in raw milk outbreaks were 13 times more likely to be hospitalized than those who got ill from pasteurized milk during an outbreak.\nAs a consumer, you can take steps when grocery shopping and at home with all of your dairy products to minimize the risk of getting sick:\nOnly consume pasteurized milk and milk products. Look for the word \"pasteurized\" on the dairy labels. If in doubt, don't buy it!\nKeep pasteurized dairy products refrigerated at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below at home and dispose of any expired products to reduce the risk of illness.\nIf you consume soft, fresh, un-aged cheeses like queso fresco, make sure they are made from pasteurized milk. Aged cheeses made from raw milk are generally okay to eat because germs usually die off during the aging process.

Formed to keep organic Maine dairy farmers in business, 90% of their profits are returned to the farms that produce their milk and share ownership in the company. They recovered from a setback in September, and went on and partnered with Wayside Food Programs in Portland to provide better access to organic milk to who couldn\u2019t otherwise affort it. Congratulations, MOOMilk!\nMOOMilk is one year old \u2014\u00a0Thank you to everyone who helped get us this far!\nJanuary 26th marked MOOMilk\u2019s first anniversary.\nIn a year\u2019s time we have gone from selling no milk to selling more than 3,000 cartons of local organic milk every week. We\u2019ve done this with the help of our business partners \u2014 all Maine family businesses \u2014 who produce, truck, process and distribute our milk, as well as our investors who put their money into our company because they believe in the importance of local agriculture and supporting the local economy.\nMost importantly, we\u2019ve done this with the help of our loyal customers who continue to purchase MOOMilk. For a year now you have helped keep our family farms in business by purchasing Maine\u2019s Own Organic Milk at your local store. Today, MOOMilk can be found in Hannaford, IGA and natural food stores all over Maine, as well as in Whole Foods Stores in Maine and Massachusetts and the Harvest Coop chain in metro Boston.\nWe also have partnered with Wayside Food Programs in Portland, a wonderful non-profit that runs soup kitchens and supplies food pantries throughout southern Maine. Any food group will tell you that milk is the most expensive part of their program, so we are especially proud that the donation program we set up with Wayside has helped provide wholesome organic milk to those who otherwise could not afford it.\nWhile we are pleased to have met the milestone of one year in business, we know that we need to grow our business in order to sustain it. As is the case with most small businesses, we operated our first year with the help of startup funds provided by investors and a credit line. Our goal for this coming year is to double our sales, so that by the time we get to 2012 we are a sustainable business and earning a profit \u2014 90 percent of which will be returned to our farmers. Along the way, we hope to be able to offer some of the additional products that many of you have asked for \u2014 butter in one-pound packages, cream and half & half in consumer packaging, and perhaps some flavored milk products as well.\nThe guiding principle of our company is to provide a stable market for our family farms. The best way you can help us help our farmers is to buy their milk, and urge your friends and family to do the same. If you don\u2019t see our milk in your store, stop at the customer service desk and ask for it. Remind the store that MOOMilk can be purchased through the Oakhurst and the Crown of Maine distribution systems, as well as NEFoodEx in Massachusetts.\nAlso, please consider participating in our Wayside donation program. Under this program, you purchase milk directly from MOOMilk, at below retail prices, and we see that your milk is made available to Wayside as needed. This not only provides additional sales to help our farmers, but because Wayside is a non-profit organization, your donation can be tax deductible. When you purchase milk under this program, MOOMilk will send you a receipt for the purchase and Wayside will send you an acknowledgement of your donation. You can learn more about this program, and the other work that Wayside does, by visiting our MOOMilk website.\nAs we look back over our first year, we thank outgoing Commissioner of Agriculture Seth Bradstreet III, who remains a good friend and strong supporter of our project. We look forward to continuing to work with the Department under the leadership of incoming Commissioner Walter Whitcomb.\nThank you, also, to our partners in this venture, Schoppee Milk Transport, Smiling Hill Dairy, Oakhurst Dairy, Crown of Maine Organic Cooperative, MOFGA and Maine Farm Bureau.\nAnd most of all, thank you to our wonderful base of customers, without whose support we would not be celebrating our first anniversary.\nFor more information about MOOMilk and their program with Wayside, please visit www.moomilk.com .\nCheese Chicks: Teaching Kids How Cheese is Made\nFebruary 2, 2011 by Debra .\nCooking with kids is a great activity when there\u2019s a snow day and cabin fever threatens.

Milk needs you!\nJuly 14, 2010 by Debra .\nMaine\u2019s Own Organic Milk or M.O.O. Milk is the result of an unusual partnership \u2014 the milk is produced on Maine farms, and trucked, processed and distributed through a strong network of family-owned businesses, all in Maine. And integral to this partnership is you, the consumer. From Marada Cook of Crown O\u2019 Maine Organic Cooperative :\nI usually like to start off easy, but we need to have a hard talk.\u00a0 M.O.O. Milk needs your help.\nMOO Milk is the one milk company in the state that stands a chance of offering farmers an independent outlet for organic milk, at a price that makes organic dairy farming commercially viable in Maine.\nThat means, the visitors that love green fields need to drink M.O.O. Milk.\nThe residents who like their cows to eat hay in the winter instead of a heavy grain diet need to drink M.O.O. Milk.\nThe moms who care what their kids will look like in 5 or 10 years (never mind themselves) need to drink M.O.O. Milk.\nThe folks that want farms to thrive in Maine and think that agricultural subsidies are ruining this country need to drink M.O.O. Milk.\nThe economists who wring their hands over the collapse of the medium scale ag infrastructure in this state need to drink M.O.O. Milk.\nAnyone who thinks M.O.O. Milk is too expensive needs to drink M.O.O. Milk.\nThe only way to bring the price of M.O.O. Milk into line with people\u2019s milk expectations is to convey to them that the state minimum pricing for milk is a smokescreen hiding farm decay and false economics. M.O.O. Milk (and any small raw dairy, for that matter) are offering milk at the only price that is \u2018affordable\u2019 to our industry. The difference between a small raw dairy and M.O.O. is that M.O.O. Milk works for organic dairy farmers across the state, not just one individual farm. It is the Crown O\u2019Maine of Milk.\nWithout high price benchmarks, we cannot keep farm bankruptcy at bay. Without a company that works for farmers, such as M.O.O. Milk, there is no one to wave a flag when the pricing of milk no longer reflects the costs to produce it.\nWe need M.O.O. Milk to survive so it can grow as a model for other commodity products in Maine.\u00a0\u00a0 The state minimum is not enough to help local agriculture thrive. And now is the time for you to take a stand.\nSix weeks. That is how much time M.O.O. Milk Company has to grow its customer base by 3000 gallons a week.\nThat\u2019s how long I want you to put M.O.O. into every cup of coffee at your store or restaurant. Every scoop of gelato. Every glass your toddler downs. Every Vichyssoise. Every cat dish.

The earliest source is from the proto-Indo-European root *kwat-, which means \"to ferment, become sour\".\nMore recently, cheese comes from chese (in Middle English ) and c\u012bese or c\u0113se (in Old English ). Similar words are shared by other West Germanic languages \u2014 West Frisian tsiis, Dutch kaas, German K\u00e4se, Old High German ch\u0101si \u2014 all from the reconstructed West-Germanic form *kasjus, which in turn is an early borrowing from Latin.\nWhen the Romans began to make hard cheeses for their legionaries' supplies, a new word started to be used: formaticum, from caseus formatus, or \"molded cheese\" (as in \"formed\", not \"moldy\"). It is from this word that the French fromage, Italian formaggio, Catalan formatge, Breton fourmaj, and Proven\u00e7al furmo are derived. Cheese itself is occasionally employed in a sense that means \"molded\" or \"formed\". Head cheese uses the word in this sense.\nHistory\nOrigins\nA piece of soft curd cheese, oven baked to increase longevity\nCheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history . There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheesemaking originated, either in Europe , Central Asia or the Middle East , but the practice had spread within Europe prior to Roman times and, according to Pliny the Elder , had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman Empire came into being. [3]\nProposed dates for the origin of cheesemaking range from around 8000 BCE (when sheep were first domesticated ) to around 3000 BCE. The first cheese may have been made by people in the Middle East or by nomadic Turkic tribes in Central Asia. Since animal skins and inflated internal organs have, since ancient times, provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs, it is probable that the process of cheese making was discovered accidentally by storing milk in a container made from the stomach of an animal, resulting in the milk being turned to curd and whey by the rennet from the stomach. There is a legend with variations about the discovery of cheese by an Arab trader who used this method of storing milk. [4] [5]\nCheesemaking may have begun independently of this by the pressing and salting of curdled milk to preserve it. Observation that the effect of making milk in an animal stomach gave more solid and better-textured curds, may have led to the deliberate addition of rennet.\nThe earliest archeological evidence of cheesemaking has been found in Egyptian tomb murals, dating to about 2000 BCE. [6] The earliest cheeses were likely to have been quite sour and salty, similar in texture to rustic cottage cheese or feta , a crumbly, flavorful Greek cheese.\nCheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than the Middle East, required less salt for preservation. With less salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for useful microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their respective flavors.\nAncient Greece and Rome\nCheese in a market in Italy\nAncient Greek mythology credited Aristaeus with the discovery of cheese. Homer 's Odyssey (8th century BCE) describes the Cyclops making and storing sheep's and goats' milk cheese. From Samuel Butler's translation:\nWe soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went inside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could hold...\nWhen he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each of them have her own young. He curdled half the milk and set it aside in wicker strainers.\nBy Roman times , cheese was an everyday food and cheesemaking a mature art. Columella 's De Re Rustica (circa 65 CE) details a cheesemaking process involving rennet coagulation, pressing of the curd, salting, and aging. Pliny's Natural History (77 CE) devotes a chapter (XI, 97) to describing the diversity of cheeses enjoyed by Romans of the early Empire . He stated that the best cheeses came from the villages near N\u00eemes , but did not keep long and had to be eaten fresh. Cheeses of the Alps and Apennines were as remarkable for their variety then as now. A Ligurian cheese was noted for being made mostly from sheep's milk, and some cheeses produced nearby were stated to weigh as much as a thousand pounds each. Goats' milk cheese was a recent taste in Rome, improved over the \"medicinal taste\" of Gaul 's similar cheeses by smoking . Of cheeses from overseas, Pliny preferred those of Bithynia in Asia Minor.\nCheese, Tacuinum sanitatis Casanatensis (XIV century)\nPost-Roman Europe\nAs Romanized populations encountered unfamiliar newly-settled neighbors, bringing their own cheese-making traditions, their own flocks and their own unrelated words for cheese, cheeses in Europe diversified further, with various locales developing their own distinctive traditions and products. As long-distance trade collapsed, only travelers would encounter unfamiliar cheeses: Charlemagne 's first encounter with a white cheese that had an edible rind forms one of the constructed anecdotes of Notker 's Life of the Emperor. [7] The British Cheese Board claims that Britain has approximately 700 distinct local cheeses; [8] France and Italy have perhaps 400 each. (A French proverb holds there is a different French cheese for every day of the year, and Charles de Gaulle once asked \"how can you govern a country in which there are 246 kinds of cheese?\" [9] ) Still, the advancement of the cheese art in Europe was slow during the centuries after Rome's fall. Many cheeses today were first recorded in the late Middle Ages or after\u2014 cheeses like Cheddar around 1500 CE, Parmesan in 1597, Gouda in 1697, and Camembert in 1791. [10]\nIn 1546, The Proverbs of John Heywood claimed \" the moon is made of a greene cheese .\" (Greene may refer here not to the color, as many now think, but to being new or unaged.) [11] Variations on this sentiment were long repeated and NASA exploited this myth for an April Fools' Day spoof announcement in 2006. [12]\nModern era\nUntil its modern spread along with European culture, cheese was nearly unheard of in oriental cultures, in the pre-Columbian Americas, and only had limited use in sub-Mediterranean Africa, mainly being widespread and popular only in Europe and areas influenced strongly by its cultures. But with the spread, first of European imperialism, and later of Euro-American culture and food, cheese has gradually become known and increasingly popular worldwide, though still rarely considered a part of local ethnic cuisines outside Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas.[ citation needed ]\nThe first factory for the industrial production of cheese opened in Switzerland in 1815, but it was in the United States where large-scale production first found real success. Credit usually goes to Jesse Williams, a dairy farmer from Rome , New York , who in 1851 started making cheese in an assembly-line fashion using the milk from neighboring farms. Within decades hundreds of such dairy associations existed.[ citation needed ]\nThe 1860s saw the beginnings of mass-produced rennet, and by the turn of the century scientists were producing pure microbial cultures. Before then, bacteria in cheesemaking had come from the environment or from recycling an earlier batch's whey; the pure cultures meant a more standardized cheese could be produced. [13]\nFactory-made cheese overtook traditional cheesemaking in the World War II era, and factories have been the source of most cheese in America and Europe ever since. Today, Americans buy more processed cheese than \"real\", factory-made or not. [14]\nProduction\nThis section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .\n(November 2007)\nSwiss cheesemaking (heating stage)\nDuring industrial production of Emmental cheese, the as-yet-undrained curd is broken by rotating mixers.\nA required step in cheesemaking is separating the milk into solid curds and liquid whey . Usually this is done by acidifying ( souring ) the milk and adding rennet . The acidification can be accomplished directly by the addition of an acid like vinegar in a few cases ( paneer , queso fresco ), but usually starter bacteria are employed instead. These starter bacteria convert milk sugars into lactic acid . The same bacteria (and the enzymes they produce) also play a large role in the eventual flavor of aged cheeses. Most cheeses are made with starter bacteria from the Lactococci , Lactobacilli , or Streptococci families. Swiss starter cultures also include Propionibacter shermani , which produces carbon dioxide gas bubbles during aging, giving Swiss cheese or Emmental its holes (called eyes \").\nSome fresh cheeses are curdled only by acidity, but most cheeses also use rennet. Rennet sets the cheese into a strong and rubbery gel compared to the fragile curds produced by acidic coagulation alone. It also allows curdling at a lower acidity\u2014important because flavor-making bacteria are inhibited in high-acidity environments. In general, softer, smaller, fresher cheeses are curdled with a greater proportion of acid to rennet than harder, larger, longer-aged varieties.\nCurd processing\nAt this point, the cheese has set into a very moist gel. Some soft cheeses are now essentially complete: they are drained, salted, and packaged. For most of the rest, the curd is cut into small cubes. This allows water to drain from the individual pieces of curd.\nSome hard cheeses are then heated to temperatures in the range of 35\u201355 \u00b0C (95\u2013131\u00a0\u00b0F). This forces more whey from the cut curd. It also changes the taste of the finished cheese, affecting both the bacterial culture and the milk chemistry. Cheeses that are heated to the higher temperatures are usually made with thermophilic starter bacteria that survive this step\u2014either Lactobacilli or Streptococci .\nSalt has roles in cheese besides adding a salty flavor. It preserves cheese from spoiling, draws moisture from the curd, and firms cheese\u2019s texture in an interaction with its proteins . Some cheeses are salted from the outside with dry salt or brine washes. Most cheeses have the salt mixed directly into the curds.\nCheese factory in Holland\nOther techniques influence a cheese's texture and flavor. Some examples:\nStretching: ( Mozzarella , Provolone ) The curd is stretched and kneaded in hot water, developing a stringy, fibrous body.\nCheddaring : ( Cheddar , other English cheeses) The cut curd is repeatedly piled up, pushing more moisture away. The curd is also mixed (or milled) for a long time, taking the sharp edges off the cut curd pieces and influencing the final product's texture.\nWashing: ( Edam , Gouda , Colby ) The curd is washed in warm water, lowering its acidity and making for a milder-tasting cheese.\nMost cheeses achieve their final shape when the curds are pressed into a mold or form. The harder the cheese, the more pressure is applied. The pressure drives out moisture\u2014the molds are designed to allow water to escape\u2014and unifies the curds into a single solid body.\nParmigiano reggiano in a modern factory\nRipening\nMain article: Cheese ripening\nA newborn cheese is usually salty yet bland in flavor and, for harder varieties, rubbery in texture. These qualities are sometimes enjoyed\u2014 cheese curds are eaten on their own\u2014but normally cheeses are left to rest under controlled conditions. This aging period (also called ripening, or, from the French, affinage) lasts from a few days to several years. As a cheese ages, microbes and enzymes transform texture and intensify flavor. This transformation is largely a result of the breakdown of casein proteins and milkfat into a complex mix of amino acids , amines , and fatty acids .\nSome cheeses have additional bacteria or molds intentionally introduced before or during aging. In traditional cheesemaking, these microbes might be already present in the aging room; they are simply allowed to settle and grow on the stored cheeses. More often today, prepared cultures are used, giving more consistent results and putting fewer constraints on the environment where the cheese ages. These cheeses include soft ripened cheeses such as Brie and Camembert , blue cheeses such as Roquefort , Stilton , Gorgonzola , and rind-washed cheeses such as Limburger .\nTypes\nFeta from Greece\nThere are several types of cheese, with around 500 different varieties recognised by the International Dairy Federation, [15] over 400 identified by Walter and Hargrove, over 500 by Burkhalter, and over 1,000 by Sandine and Elliker. [16] The varieties may be grouped or classified into types according to criteria such as length of ageing, texture, methods of making, fat content, animal milk, country or region of origin, etc. \u2013 with these criteria either being used singly or in combination, [17] but with no single method being universally used. [18] The method most commonly and traditionally used is based on moisture content, which is then further discriminated by fat content and curing or ripening methods. [15] [19] Some attempts have been made to rationalise the classification of cheese \u2013 a scheme was proposed by Pieter Walstra which uses the primary and secondary starter combined with moisture content, and Walter and Hargrove suggested classifying by production methods which produces 18 types, which are then further grouped by moisture content. [15]\nMoisture content (soft to hard)\nCategorizing cheeses by firmness is a common but inexact practice. The lines between \"soft\", \"semi-soft\", \"semi-hard\", and \"hard\" are arbitrary, and many types of cheese are made in softer or firmer variations. The main factor that controls cheese hardness is moisture content, which depends largely on the pressure with which it is packed into molds, and on aging time.\nFresh, whey and stretched curd cheeses\nThe main factor in the categorization of these cheese is their age. Fresh cheeses without additional preservatives can spoil in a matter of days.\nContent (double cream, goat, ewe and water buffalo)\nEmmentaler\nSome cheeses are categorized by the source of the milk used to produce them or by the added fat content of the milk from which they are produced. While most of the world's commercially available cheese is made from cows' milk, many parts of the world also produce cheese from goats and sheep. Double cream cheeses are soft cheeses of cows' milk enriched with cream so that their fat content is 60% or, in the case of triple creams, 75%.\nSoft-ripened and blue-vein\nThere are at least three main categories of cheese in which the presence of mold is a significant feature: soft ripened cheeses, washed rind cheeses and blue cheeses.\nProcessed cheeses\nProcessed cheese is made from traditional cheese and emulsifying salts, often with the addition of milk, more salt, preservatives , and food coloring . It is inexpensive, consistent, and melts smoothly. It is sold packaged and either pre-sliced or unsliced, in a number of varieties. It is also available in aerosol cans in some countries.\nEating and cooking\nZigerbr\u00fct , cheese grated onto bread through a mill, from the Kanton Glarus in Switzerland .\nAt refrigerator temperatures, the fat in a piece of cheese is as hard as unsoftened butter , and its protein structure is stiff as well. Flavor and odor compounds are less easily liberated when cold. For improvements in flavor and texture, it is widely advised that cheeses be allowed to warm up to room temperature before eating. If the cheese is further warmed, to 26\u201332 \u00b0C (79\u201390\u00a0\u00b0F), the fats will begin to \"sweat out\" as they go beyond soft to fully liquid. [20]\nAbove room temperatures, most hard cheeses melt. Rennet-curdled cheeses have a gel -like protein matrix that is broken down by heat. When enough protein bonds are broken, the cheese itself turns from a solid to a viscous liquid. Soft, high-moisture cheeses will melt at around 55 \u00b0C (131\u00a0\u00b0F), while hard, low-moisture cheeses such as Parmesan remain solid until they reach about 82 \u00b0C (180\u00a0\u00b0F). [21] Acid-set cheeses, including halloumi , paneer , some whey cheeses and many varieties of fresh goat cheese , have a protein structure that remains intact at high temperatures. When cooked, these cheeses just get firmer as water evaporates.\nSome cheeses, like raclette , melt smoothly; many tend to become stringy or suffer from a separation of their fats. Many of these can be coaxed into melting smoothly in the presence of acids or starch . Fondue , with wine providing the acidity, is a good example of a smoothly melted cheese dish. [22] Elastic stringiness is a quality that is sometimes enjoyed, in dishes including pizza and Welsh rarebit . Even a melted cheese eventually turns solid again, after enough moisture is cooked off. The saying \"you can't melt cheese twice\" (meaning \"some things can only be done once\") refers to the fact that oils leach out during the first melting and are gone, leaving the non-meltable solids behind.\nAs its temperature continues to rise, cheese will brown and eventually burn. Browned, partially burned cheese has a particular distinct flavor of its own and is frequently used in cooking (e.g., sprinkling atop items before baking them).\nHealth and nutrition\nIn general, cheese supplies a great deal of calcium , protein , phosphorus and fat . A 30-gram (1.1\u00a0oz) serving of Cheddar cheese contains about 7 grams (0.25\u00a0oz) of protein and 200\u00a0milligrams of calcium. Nutritionally, cheese is essentially concentrated milk: it takes about 200 grams (7.1\u00a0oz) of milk to provide that much protein, and 150 grams (5.3\u00a0oz) to equal the calcium. [23]\nHeart disease\nCheese potentially shares other nutritional properties of milk. The Center for Science in the Public Interest describes cheese as America's number one source of saturated fat , adding that the average American ate 30\u00a0lb (14\u00a0kg) of cheese in the year 2000, up from 11\u00a0lb (5\u00a0kg) in 1970. [24] Their recommendation is to limit full-fat cheese consumption to 2\u00a0oz (57\u00a0g) a week. Whether or not cheese's highly saturated fat content actually leads to an increased risk of heart disease is a subject of debate, as epidemiological studies have observed relatively low incidences of cardiovascular disease in populations such as France and Greece , which lead the world in cheese consumption (more than 14\u00a0oz/400\u00a0g a week per person, or over 45\u00a0lb/20\u00a0kg a year). [25] This seeming discrepancy is called the French paradox ; the higher rates of consumption of red wine in these countries is often invoked as at least a partial explanation.\nDental health\nSome studies claim that cheddar, mozzarella, Swiss and American cheeses can help to prevent tooth decay . [26] [27] Several mechanisms for this protection have been proposed:\nThe calcium, protein, and phosphorus in cheese may act to protect tooth enamel .\nCheese increases saliva flow, washing away acids and sugars.\nEffect on sleep\nA study by the British Cheese Board in 2005 to determine the effect of cheese upon sleep and dreaming discovered that, contrary to the idea that cheese commonly causes nightmares , the effect of cheese upon sleep was positive. The majority of the two hundred people tested over a fortnight claimed beneficial results from consuming cheeses before going to bed, the cheese promoting good sleep. Six cheeses were tested and the findings were that the dreams produced were specific to the type of cheese. Although the apparent effects were in some cases described as colorful and vivid, or cryptic, none of the cheeses tested were found to induce nightmares. However, the six cheeses were all British. The results might be entirely different if a wider range of cheeses were tested. [28] Cheese contains tryptophan , an amino acid that has been found to relieve stress and induce sleep. [29]\nCasein\nLike other dairy products, cheese contains casein , a substance that when digested by humans breaks down into several chemicals, including casomorphine , an opioid peptide . In the early 1990s it was hypothesized that autism can be caused or aggravated by opioid peptides. [30] Studies supporting these claims have had significant flaws, so the data are inadequate to guide autism treatment recommendations. [31]\nLactose\nCheese is often avoided by those who are lactose intolerant , but ripened cheeses like Cheddar contain only about 5% of the lactose found in whole milk , and aged cheeses contain almost none. [32] Nevertheless, people with severe lactose intolerance should avoid eating dairy cheese. As a natural product, the same kind of cheese may contain different amounts of lactose on different occasions, causing unexpected painful reactions.\nHypertensive effect\nSome people suffer reactions to amines found in cheese, particularly histamine and tyramine . Some aged cheeses contain significant concentrations of these amines, which can trigger symptoms mimicking an allergic reaction : headaches , rashes , and blood pressure elevations.\nPasteurization\nA number of food safety agencies around the world have warned of the risks of raw-milk cheeses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration states that soft raw-milk cheeses can cause \"serious infectious diseases including listeriosis , brucellosis , salmonellosis and tuberculosis \". [33] It is U.S. law since 1944 that all raw-milk cheeses (including imports since 1951) must be aged at least 60 days. Australia has a wide ban on raw-milk cheeses as well, though in recent years exceptions have been made for Swiss Gruy\u00e8re , Emmental and Sbrinz , and for French Roquefort . [34] There is a trend for cheeses to be pasteurized even when not required by law.\nCompulsory pasteurization is controversial. Pasteurization does change the flavor of cheeses, and unpasteurized cheeses are often considered to have better flavor, so there are reasons not to pasteurize all cheeses. Some say that health concerns are overstated, or that milk pasteurization does not ensure cheese safety. [35]\nPregnant women may face an additional risk from cheese; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has warned pregnant women against eating soft-ripened cheeses and blue-veined cheeses, due to the listeria risk, which can cause miscarriage or harm to the fetus during birth. [36]\nWeight loss, blood pressure and blood sugar\nA 2009 study at the Curtin University of Technology compared individuals who consumed three servings per day to those who consumed five per day. The researchers concluded that increased consumption resulted in a reduction of abdominal fat, blood pressure and blood sugar. [37]\nWorld production and consumption\nThis article is outdated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. Please see the talk page for more information.\n(November 2010)\nWorldwide, cheese is a major agricultural product. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations , over 18 million metric tons of cheese were produced worldwide in 2004. This is about three kilos for each person on Earth. The largest producer of cheese is the United States, accounting for 30% of world production, followed by Germany and France.\nTop cheese producers\n"}], [{"score": 1632.919, "uuid": "7f89f040-67aa-5976-9f7b-5b91889dc3bc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0705wb-85-14078", "target_hostname": "www.tomatom.com", "target_uri": "http://www.tomatom.com/2008/08/confessions-of-a-cheese-judge-and-a-call-to-action/", "page_rank": 1.1868302e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Confessions of a <em>cheese</em> judge", "snippet": "They should be promoting the greater interests of <em>cheese</em> rather <em>than</em> this single blinkered view.

I missed the briefing and my lab coat was too small even for a ten year old child. On a bright note though, the hairnet was just perfect and I was wearing the correct all-terrain underwear and cashmere socks. I\u2019m at the 2008 judging for the Melbourne Specialist Cheese Show (open Sunday 17th August 2008 at Crown) run by the Australian Specialist Cheesemakers Association.\nI admired chief judge Ian\u2019s red hairnet as he explained the 300 cheeses that lay ahead. Luckily it was split into ten categories. A couple of judges would shortlist each category so we only had to taste 50 or so of the stinkers (or in some cases not so stinky) blind.\nEach cheese was scored 25 for flavour, 15 for texture and 10 for the look (and most were pretty good looking).\nMy category was one of the shorter straws, the curd cheeses. This is one area where Australia hasn\u2019t quite mastered yet. The mozzarella-type cheeses were for the most part good looking, creamy testicular balls, some tasting quite good, but all rubbery. Unfortunately my benchmark is the Italian stuff (you can get it from Kirkfood when it\u2019s in stock), which has the outside texture of plump breast but melts apart.\nEnviously, I looked on as Matt Preston cut a manly-sized wedge of a blue cheese casting his expert eye over its veining. That was before I accidentally looked into the cheese spittoon. And it\u2019s probably best to move on\u2026\nThe verdict\nAustralian cheese tends towards creamy and bland.\nBrie-type cheeses seem to be a bit to stiff or a little too runny.\nNot daring enough with strong flavours\nWork needed on the veining of some blue cheeses\nThere were some cheeses that I\u2019d have liked to see in the show that weren\u2019t (unless they\u2019d already been knocked-out.\nAustralia is best at making goats cheese with some great flavours and textures. Why wasn\u2019t there more goats cheese entered?\nOverall though, the cheeses were a lot better than expected. We\u2019ve come a long way in cheese in the past few years but really need to make unpasteurised products if we are to progress.\nThe good news (thanks for sending it through Thermomixer ) is that the plonkers at Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ ) have announced the terms of its review of dairy processing standards that currently ban, with a few exceptions, anything made with raw milk.\nAs Will Studd says, there massive local resistance to change. Some of it is from within the cheese industry itself. Gawd knows why.\n\u201cIt has taken twelve years of lobbying to get to this point , and its very\nunlikely another review will be undertaken for another decade . If you care\nabout good cheese please make a submission \u2026\n\u2026Without a choice on the production and sale of raw milk cheese in Australia\nwe will never develop a genuine cheese culture , or experience the authentic\nregional flavours of cheese enjoyed by our counterparts overseas.\u201d\nSo remember if you care about cheese go here now to the Food Standards website and and search P1007. Submissions close 6pm, September 17 2008.\nDuncan | Syrup&Tang August 16, 2008 at 11:17 pm\nAmusing commentary, Ed. I\u2019m heading there tomorrow\u2026 pity there aren\u2019t so many goats in the show, by the sounds of it. Greatly agree on your \u2018bland and creamy\u2019 observation, and the comment about mozzarella. If look forward to the day when Aussie mozz is less like the inside of a golfball!\nBruny Island Cheese Co. August 17, 2008 at 6:25 am\nHi Ed. Good to read about the cheese show. My understanding is that you need to be a memebr of the ASCA to enter this show and with so many of the really good cheese makers in Australia not being members of the ASCA, it might explain why some of your favourites were absent.\nEd August 17, 2008 at 5:11 pm\nDuncan, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not just me. Hope you enjoyed yourself. I\u2019ve no idea which won because we were tasting blind.\nNick, that explains it then. The other thing I noticed is that even the good ones we don\u2019t really see in shops much. It seems there is a bit of a distribution problem i suppose which is natural for small producers.\nut si, a nice creamy cheese and a sauv blanc -I guess that\u2019s the mass taste.\nut si August 17, 2008 at 7:24 pm\nooops, I kinda like a sav blanc\u2026sometimes\u2026in summer\u2026it\u2019s the gooseberries\u2026oh the shame.\nSpeaking of cheese, Ashgrove here in Tas make a drop dead gorgeous farmhouse butter now\u2026VERY rich yellow with strong aroma & lovely tang\u2026great for shortcrust pastry.\nThermomixer August 18, 2008 at 10:48 am\nHi Bruny Island, as a founding member of the ASCA, why aren\u2019t more cheesemakers members? Guess it\u2019s political, and possibly related to the pasteurised cheese/importation debates?\nI decided to go yesterday for a look and there weren\u2019t that many exhibitors. Many of the good cheeses had Richard Thomas\u2019 input in some form, but those serving the cheeses didn\u2019t know who he is!!\nThe Yarra Valley Marinated Feta (which I think was the \u201cchampion\u201d) is 110% from RT.\nNick, are you in favour of unpasteurised milk for cheeses ?\nBTW -Bruny Island Cheese Co. above is missing an \u201ca\u201d from island so the link does not work.\nEd August 18, 2008 at 11:11 am\nFixed it for him Thermomixer.\nWhat I really want to know is for an association that started off with such high ideals where they lost the will. From To Die For by Stephen Downes: \u201cThe Australian Specialist Cheesemakers Association, which was set up in 1996 to promote raw-cheesemaking, has no interest these days in using unpasteurized milk. At base, its members are too lazy and cheap to implement safety measures to minimize bacterial contamination of raw milk. The politics of it all is Byzantine, the vested interests huge.\u201d\nBruny Island Cheese Co. August 19, 2008 at 5:35 am\nI guess I can only give you my story when it comes to the ASCA. In essence, I stopped being a memebr when the association stopped representing my views. Also, being in southern tasmania, it is really difficult to get the full value out of the expensive membership fee as I can not attend any of the meetings and functions.\nThe raw milk thing is a huge reason that I am not a member. It really should be called the Australian Specialist Cheesemakers (that do not want to make raw milk cheese) Association, as there are a number of artisan producers who are not memebers because of the ASCA\u2019s position on this. It is a shame, because we are a small industry and it would be great to have the one industry association that represents all the specialist cheesemakers in Australia \u2013 and all their views. But the ASCA has modelled itself on the views of it\u2019s board members rather than the industry as a whole.\nSo Thermo, yes, I am obviously passionate about the need to make raw milk cheese in Australia. It is the only way for artisan cheesemakers to prosper and the only way that we will get the cheeses which were so dissapointingly absent from the ASCA show.\nneil August 19, 2008 at 8:08 am\nSkipped on down to Kirkfood for my breast, err, cheese ball and it was everything you promised. I\u2019ve had quite a few of the local buffalo mozzarella balls but felt quite shamed that I didn\u2019t get what people were on about; their Pomella brand was in a whole other league, tight skin covering the creamy, quivering mass of sweet curd\u2026I so get it now. Btw, I didn\u2019t say who I was and they were happy to serve me straight from the street \u2014 Bok\u2019s bacon, sensational; their traditional polenta is the best I\u2019ve ever had, wonderful pure corn flavour without any hint of sourness that bedevils the quick cook types, but also very hard core\u2026there isn\u2019t any instruction on how to cook it anywhere on the pack.\nI agree with you about the state of Aussie cheeses, there a very few that have much character at all. Just as our wine industry has been charged with making high alcohol fruit bombs, our cheese nobs seem to be intent on high cholesterol cream bombs without much flavour. Good point about the veining in blue cheeses; I once bought a big name brand blue cheese that didn\u2019t have any veining at all! Weird, it tasted blue and on enquiry the company said that the holes sometimes close up after piercing if the chees is too soft and the blue veins can\u2019t develop. But really, how can that put such a product on the shelves if it hasn\u2019t been tested? Does that say something about the state of the industry?\nThermomixer August 19, 2008 at 10:35 am\nThanks Bruny\nHaving shared a lait cru fermi\u00e8re Camembert at Chateau de Brou in 1999 I thought that it might be the case that you would support raw milk cheeses.\nIt really is a shame that cheesemakers can\u2019t be a cohesive group, but the big worry from many cheesemakers is that once the ban is lifted there will be more imported cheeses to compete against, and they will have a smaller share of the market.\nI am old enough to remember Will Studd promoting Australian cheeses and assisting the Camerons at Merdith amongst others to develop their cheese, before the ban was introduced. He was very actively encouraging those who now argue against his request for re-introducing \u2013 not introducing \u2013 raw milk cheese to Australia.\nBruny Island has shown what can be done if you get a good education overseas and apply that knowledge.\nAustralia has more varieties of blue cheese than probably any other country and I wonder whether to some extent it is in the hope that adding blue cultures will give flavours that are lacking from attempts at white mould/washed rind cheeses. Also they have longer storage capabilities.\nWill Studd & David brown \u201cdebated\u201d the issue on ABC National on Friday \u2013 the podcast is available here and their segment is about 27 minutes into the program.\nWe no longer have brucellosis and TB to worry about in the milk. Pasteurising doesn\u2019t remove every bacteria and can fail if temperatures/timing aren\u2019t adhered to, and the cheese can become contaminated later in production from poor hygeine.\nWe should have a choice, we finally got Italian prosciutto and Spanish jamon. Bring back raw milk cheese.\nEd August 19, 2008 at 10:37 am\nNick, that\u2019s a shame they\u2019ve gone that way. They should be promoting the greater interests of cheese rather than this single blinkered view. It\u2019s not to say that all raw milk cheese is good or all pasteurized cheese is bad but a bit of diversity would be good. And I guess that also goes for the source of the milk in terms of breeds of cows, sheep and goat etc.\nNeil, Glad you went and bought it. It is astonishingly good isn\u2019t it and completely different to anything made locally. I must get don there for the bacon and Polenta perhaps.\nG Biron August 19, 2008 at 12:20 pm\nThermo\nyes we have Spanish Jamon and Italian Proscuitto but we dont have Cardoso or any other real ham here? do we? And not likely to in the near future.\nEd August 19, 2008 at 12:26 pm\nGeorge, have you tried the stuff that Robert Marchetti is is having made to his specs in Lismore?Apparently they are opening a modern factory up there with all the computer controlled paraphernalia \u2013 shutters opening to let the air circulate and so on. It\u2019s the main reason to visit Guiseppe Arnaldo & Sons to try as near to the proper stuff we have locally.\nG Biron August 19, 2008 at 12:56 pm\nEd sorry to hijack the discussion but\nThermo, I no have not tried GAS and will not until I can put a Roullette wheel into the sex kitten salon, or perhaps a crapshoot into the shed next to the two-up?\nLevel playing fields are just a myth, we are allowed to make a Parmesan style cheese but who will? Probably an Italian company who can see the fututre in the way the French wine companies have.\nI am all for legal raw milk cheese and a moratorium on raw milk cheese imports until the local raw milk cheesemakers get established. Say 5 years. I wonder what Will Studd would say to that?\nThermomixer August 19, 2008 at 1:02 pm\nHi George, might have to discuss it over a snag on Monday. Will I bring some more jamon ? I didn\u2019t find out from you last time about all the crap that \u201ckilled\u201d Angel. Thought that it was beaurocracy rather than competition. Remember to blast or enlighten me.\nStill believe that we need to be able to have these products availbale for local consumers as well as producers so that they know what a particular products should taste/smell/feel/look like. Sort of benchmarking.\nI support the locals, have been a producer and don\u2019t have vast amounts of money to only buy imported stuff, but still see a place for it. I bought loads of Angel\u2019s product & would still, even with the imports available.\nThermomixer August 19, 2008 at 2:11 pm\nSorry Ed for (ab)using space here, but just quickly. Sorry to have upset you George. I don\u2019t think that it will make much difference to Will S as he would be substituting pasteurised product that he currently imports, such as Isigny Camembert, Graindorge Livarot & Pont L\u2019Eveque, for their lait cru sisters. Calendar/Fromagent sells more local than imported cheese (I believe).\nAside, I had some fanastic capocollo at Cumulus Inc on Friday from Daysleford despite reports .\nWhile surfing I came across this old report in The Age . In particular, I like the quote from Sam Hirst \u201cYou can\u2019t have people throwing caution to the winds,\u201d he says, \u201cbut if a guy\u2019s been making cheeses or smallgoods for 40 years, and not killed anyone, it\u2019s a pretty good record, isn\u2019t it? Do we want to end up 10 years from now where you are going to get two food groups \u2013 these highly processed foods with a dumbed-down taste and just a few traditionally fermented foods made by just a few surviving artisans \u2013 like the very last frontiers of flavour?\u201d\nBTW, Ed advised we try GAS prosciutto \u2013 he might bring some for you on Sunday.\nEd August 19, 2008 at 2:20 pm\nGeorge, please carry on. I worry about moratoriums on imports which seem to me as bade as trade tariffs. We have to also consider th etwo-way trade we want to develop with Europe too.Our cheeses will be okay for a while with a moratorium but without a higher benchmark we\u2019ll end up with the cheese equivalent of gas guzzling Commodore\u2019s and Falcons, wichh all seem a bit out of date compared to the latest German or Italian model. Maybe when the Marchetti sponsored factory gets going we can get a wider distribution. I dream of a shop \u201cHam & Cheese\u201d, a sleek glass -plated fridge one side full of locally made meats, the other side the same full of brilliant local cheese\u2026dreams\u2026\nG Biron August 19, 2008 at 3:52 pm\nDifficult to discuss complex issues like this in short bursts but if you think that protected new raw milk cheese makers would make the cheese equivalent of Commadores or Falcons then I think you have a misguided analogy. But to follow your analogy\u2026..\nThe gas guzzlers were concieved in Detroit. Ford and GM still dictate what we make here.\nAlso, free trade tarrifs allow you to buy 45c cans of Italian tomatoes [latest italian model] in the supermarket that are dumped on us. The French also know how to get rid of the surplus. The local dried currant industry has all but been wiped out by cheap Greek currants.\nIts a delicate equation.\nFree trade is only free to the strongest trading partner.\nWhy should that shop just be a dream? perhaps because food issues are at the bottom of most political strategies.\nThermo not upset at all.\nYes the Daylesford pork products are improving very quickly and I am using them now that our local ones are gone.\nEd August 19, 2008 at 4:44 pm\nGeorge, I stand my the analogy \u2013 an industry protected that doesn\u2019t modernise or have any incentive to innovate. The EU is more about subsidies than anything else and you are right it is dificult to discuss in these tiny bursts. I\u2019d doubt quality cheese would be dumped upon us or be any cheaper than anything made locally. But I\u2019m also up for anything that gives the consumer better value and stimulates consumption. A market where we have healthy competition builds the market and develops the consumers appetite for the product with the ultimate winner being the local producer. Plus the way the world is going with high petrol prices, increased input costs generally for food, expensive carbon credits and so on, the market is naturally biased towards the local. Sorry, I was a Thatcher child.\nEd August 19, 2008 at 8:37 pm\nHey Steve, I didn\u2019t meanto ignore you. You\u2019ve got something much cooler than all those .Semi-imported flexible and eco, let\u2019s call it the goats cheese or transportation the Xtracycle. Name the date at Barney Allen\u2019s and I\u2019ll cycle up on mine.\nBruny Island Cheese Co. August 20, 2008 at 5:24 am\nGeorge and Ed, after four years of discussions, a timely letter from the Tasmanian Dairy Industry Authority yesterday confirmed that i have just been given licence to commence making my cheese, C2, from unpasteurised milk. It will be available commercially before the end of the year.\nAlthough this is only an exploitation of existing regulations (as George points out) it is a great first step and I think I am the only cheesemaker who has taken advantage of this. It allows me to get a foothold and push for further change based on evidence. I hope that others will follow, even if it just for competitive reasons.\nI think that it is really important that consumers remain part of this oush, not just cheesemakers. it is an unfortunate situation in Australaia where there is strong consumer demand for locally made raw milk cheese but precious few cheesemakers interested in meeting this demand. I often remind myself that it was the public who brought about the changes in battery hen production and the success of free-range eggs in the market \u2013 not the chook farmers.\nGeorge \u2013 a morotorium on imported cheeses! I love it! Not sure WS will jump on board though. It frustrates me how strongly we hold onto our culinary cringe in this area. Some of the imported cheeses that I regularly see on good menus in Australia are nothing more than mass-produced crap (I have visited the factories, they are not artisan products) but because they are from France, have a nice wooden box with curly writing, we allow ourselves to be seduced. I suppose smoking used to make us feel sophisticated too.\nG Biron August 20, 2008 at 8:47 am\nBruny whats C2 going to be like?\nYou are quite correct in the description of some very expensive products here are available i bulk in discount supermarkets in France but the packaging is so \u201ccool\u201d\nEd\nFirst you have to have an industry.\nSubsidy or tarriff its a complex question.\nEd August 20, 2008 at 9:04 am\nYes, I\u2019d like to hard more of C2. I agree on the mass produced products but it doesn\u2019t mean they are all bad. Most of these imported hams that everybody is swooning over all come from factories just as many good wines come from big factory operations.\nGeorge, you also need a demand, the taste of the people needs to be developed. I sense the current problem is that the greater public only have the taste for creamy bland cheeses having been brought up on tinned brie and little decent local product. I\u2019ve been in people\u2019s homes when they\u2019ve chucked brie out because it was runny and stinky no arguments. i\u2019s the same as taste for beer (VB) and fruit bomb reds. By alowing more in while the industry develops hopefully the public is educated and gets a taste for it. Then, of course, we have the natural regular of the price of getting it over here which means the local prouct can be cheaper.We shouldn\u2019t forget that immigrants or the well traveled (and we\u2019re not talking Contiki here) who\u2019ve bothered to go out of their way to eat this stuff are in the minority still.\nstickyfingers August 20, 2008 at 5:38 pm\nI was talking to my Bronwyn & Michael Cowan of The Gypsy Pig on the weekend and apparently the bureacracy associated with Listeria has crept into their industry. Under new legislation, they and other small producers are now unable to produce cured meats until a public servant is able to tell them what exactly they have to do now to comply with the red tape. After numerous calls over the last month, they are none the wiser. Apparently there are others proceeding as normal, but GP prefer to do things by the book, which is sadly leaving them with stock they are unable to sell.\nstickyfingers August 21, 2008 at 2:17 am\nBTW if anyone is interested in making a submission re. the case for raw milk, I have just posted the template of one on my DDD blog that can be copied and emailed to FSANZ.\nStructured by Will Studd, it came to me via my friends at Slow Food who are making their own submission. According to Kelly Donati: \u201c\u2026my understanding is that an individual submission has the same weight as one organisational submission so the more individual people who write in, the better!\u201d\nFeel free to modify it at your leisure or send in as is.\nJack August 21, 2008 at 2:03 pm\nI agree that the imported cheeses that we get here are just \u201cflavour shells\u201d of the real thing in Europe. Having just eaten the most amazing cheese selection at Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Hong Kong (and a holiday highlight, Epoisses), it is twenty times better than the one I can get here that goes by the same name.\nThese imported cheeses are better than 95% of what we are making here, but are definitely not as good as when made with raw milk.\nA cheese savvy french man was laughing with me the other day about the crazy price of Holy Goat La Luna (I think they have great products but are bloody expensive) and saying that it is only rivaled in price by the imported truffled Brie de Meaux, now thats scary. No wonder punters don\u2019t know what good cheese tastes like because the price needs to be set so high, that it can\u2019t even compete with something that has travelled around the globe.\nJack\nneil August 21, 2008 at 2:31 pm\nHey Jack, better buy local while you can. A cheese retailer was telling me a couple of months ago that Holy Goat was struggling which may help explain the high price. I agree that a lot of our artisan cheeses are expensive, but if we don\u2019t support them they\u2019ll just close up. As Ed mentioned, with which I agreed, our cheeses are rather bland, but the artisans who make them haven\u2019t been at it for all that long compared with Europeans; the only way they can improve is if we keep on buying them and give our feedback. Also consider that the cow that helped make that Brie de meaux gives a lot more milk than a skinny old goat, you\u2019re not comparing apples with apples. A recently bought Spanish mountain sheep\u2019s milk cheese cost $98kg, okay, a sheep isn\u2019t a goat, but it\u2019s a lot closer than a cow.\nJack August 21, 2008 at 3:00 pm\nI use to buy some specialy made cheeses from Holy Goat for work and I know that they have had some troubles; at the worst of it they couldn\u2019t supply as they could not get enough mik from the goats because of drought and feed issues.\nBUT, Holy Goat La Luna retails at $141 per kilo at Richmond Hill Cafe and Larder, and this puts it very out of reach of the general populous.\nI\u2019m not sure how to fix this, I hope they don\u2019t just \u2018give up the goat\u2019 like Kervella, but the prices are just crazy. I\u2019m sure the prices are justified, as there is no point pricing yourself out of the market, perhaps the Bruny island people can enlighten us on this and the necessary sell prices for boutique cheeses that can compare to internation competition.\nJack\nHate to disagree with fellow bloggers, but I think $16 for a little barrel of La Luna is an absolute bargain. I have never been disappointed by their cheese.\nI would not be surprised if they are actually losing money on their cheese at present.\nWork colleagues would pay that sort of money for a couple of ordinary sandwiches, a manky vanilla slice and a disgusting coffee each lunchtime. I don\u2019t think that the price is out of the reach of the populace, so much as, much of the populace doesn\u2019t appreciate good quality cheese enough to have producers charge a realistic price and there be a great enough demand.\nJack August 21, 2008 at 4:09 pm\nThermo you are not disagreeing with me, I\u2019m more playing devils advocate to get a better end result.\nI support Holy Goat, and buy their cheeses but what I am getting at is the big companies will continue to make the rubbery flavourless blocks, as long as people buy them and people will keep buying them as they can\u2019t justify the expense to buy the fancy cheese instead of the King Island or worse. Perhaps its just too expense to make great cheeses at good prices in Australia because of our environment, I don\u2019t know the answers but the prices just don\u2019t help to \u2018sell\u2019 the products to a wider range of people than the passionate foodies (sorry for swearing Ed).\nJack\nEd August 21, 2008 at 4:23 pm\nCome on Thermomixer, it is quite expensive. But it is because of the economics of small production runs of a product that spoils easily and is difficult, especially for small producers, to distribute.\nI can imagine though at that price it is difficult to make much money. Half goes to the retailer. To make $100,000 you\u2019d need to sell over 12,500 of those boxes or about 240 a week. I \u2018m guessing it is a problem of scale because there is little distribution or profile for local artisan cheese. Once volumes increase as the general public catch on then prices will come down.\nI liken it to the wine industry where small producers have to charge a lot more than large. T\u2019Gallant is one example where the price of its base Pinot Gris has fallen from $24 of something to about $16 thanks to being owned by Fosters. The winery still gets to muck about and experiment as well.\nWhat we need is a few diary giants to do the equivalent but somehow I doubt they will and for now small producers will struggle.\n"}, {"score": 1566.2258, "uuid": "d3c36480-43a6-5db5-a915-184d51a9a8c9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0202wb-21-09323", "target_hostname": "www.lifescript.com", "target_uri": "http://www.lifescript.com/food/articles/n/not_your_everyday_types_of_cheese.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1704553e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "Not Your Everyday Types Of <em>Cheese</em> | Lifescript.com", "snippet": "The <em>cheese</em> maker <em>does</em> not cook the curds, but to prolong the shelf life of the <em>cheese</em>, it is pressed to expel as much of the whey as possible.

Kane\nSpringtime Meats: Lamb and Ham\nAmericans typically use less than five different types of cheese in their kitchen. Popular varieties are: cheddar, Swiss, parmesan, mozzarella, and maybe blue. Cheese lovers should not limit themselves to the status quo; there are hundreds of types of French cheese alone. Since you may be limited as to how many types of cheese you can actually sample, below are a few of the world\u2019s favorite types of cheese, and a few of the hard-to-find varieties that are worth tracking down.\nBasic Types of Cheese\n*\u00a0 Fresh \u2014 The term for this category indicates its relatively short shelf-life. Most fresh cheeses are meant to be eaten within days of production. Fresh cheese can be made from any type of milk, and are characterized by their mild and creamy flavor. They can be spread, spooned or heaped on top of salads or fruits. Types of fresh cheese include mozzarella, cottage cheese, ricotta, mascarpone, queso fresco, cream cheese, farmers cheese, quark, feta and fromage blanc.\n*\u00a0 Soft \u2014 Soft or semi-soft cheeses encompass several narrower categories. Soft-ripened cheeses are notable for their \u201cbloomy\u201d white (and completely edible) rinds. The bloom on the rind is from an application of mold that infuses the cheese with flavor. Inside, the texture ranges from creamy to almost runny when at peak \u2014 that stage in the cheese making process when the cheese is in an optimal condition for eating. Bloomy-rind cheeses include Brie and Camembert. Soft cheese is uncooked and unpressed, allowing for a higher moisture content and the soft texture. Blue and washed-rind cheeses fall into this category, but are separated into their own classes below. Other semi-soft cheeses include Havarti, fontina, colby and Monterey Jack.\n*\u00a0 Blue/Bleu \u2014 Within every other cheese type (except for fresh cheese) there is a blue cheese. Blue cheese is made by infusing cheese with a Penicillium mold. The type of mold depends on the region in which it is made. The cheese maker mixes this mold into the milk. During the cheese making process, needles are inserted throughout the cheese round to allow pockets of air. The mold is encouraged to grow with exposure to oxygen. The result is the characteristic marbling streaks of blue and green that gives the blue cheese its unique strong flavor and contributes to its crumbly texture. Types of blue cheese include Gorgonzola, Roquefort, Stilton and Danish blue.\n*\u00a0 Washed-rind \u2014 \u201cStinky\u201d cheese is valued for its pungent and distinctly earthy flavors (once you get past the pungent dirty-sock odor). These cheeses\u2019 strong smell and taste is a result of the washing process with brine, beer, wine or a combination of these or other ingredients. Washing\u00a0 introduces a bacterium that gives an orange hue to the rind. The chemical reaction produces a tangy flavor and the \u201cstinky-feet\u201d smell. The longer the cheese ages, the more pungent its aroma will be. Most washed-rind cheeses will be soft when ripe, with the exception of some like the French Epoisses. Americans know Limburger as the most notorious of the washed-rind examples, but this category also includes the more familiar Muenster cheese.\n*\u00a0 Hard \u2014 Hard cheese can range from firm (like cheddar) or truly hard (like parmesan or other varieties that are normally grated).\nFlavors can be very mild to very sharp. \u201cOpen\u201d cheese in this category refers to those with holes, such as the generic Swiss cheese. \u201cClosed\u201d refers to a solid chunk with no fissures or holes, such as cheddar.\n*\u00a0 Uncooked pressed \u2014 This category could also be called \u201ccheddaring.\u201d The cheese maker does not cook the curds, but to prolong the shelf life of the cheese, it is pressed to expel as much of the whey as possible. Cheddar, Edam, Gouda are examples of cheeses made from this process.\n*\u00a0 Cooked pressed \u2014 Hard cheese types must be aged far longer than the softer varieties. Whereas soft-ripened cheeses may take weeks to arrive \u201cat peak,\u201d cooked pressed cheese will be left to ripen for years.\u00a0 Notable favorites are Parmigiano-Reggiano, Gruy\u00e8re and Emmental (the hole-filled cheese Americans call \u201cSwiss\u201d). Some types of cooked pressed cheese, such as Romano, Gouda or Asiago, are eaten at various stages of aging. When these cheeses are \u201cyoung,\u201d they are softer and eaten sliced. When left to age, the cheese hardens and is served grated.\nTypes of Cheese by Country of Origin\nMany countries produce cheese. France is known for its copious varieties, but nearly every European country is home to a native recipe of cheese. Some connoisseurs plan their vacations around countries or regions simply to taste different types of cheese. Some recipes are protected and stamped by the government. Parmigiano-Reggiano, for instance, can only be labeled so if it is produced in Parma, Italy and processed under certain standards.\nThis earns the label of A.O.C. (meaning a controlled designation of origin). The labels, D.O.P. (Italy) and D.O. (Spain) also carry the same meaning. Parmigiano-Reggiano is such a popular cheese that it has been copied everywhere and labeled Parmigiano, or simply Parmesan in America. When you buy a cheese with the A.O.C. label, you know you are getting a quality product that may taste much fuller and richer than its generic counterparts.\nFor various reasons, the same cheese recipe will taste differently from one country to the next. One factor is the source of milk. Was the cheese made from the milk of cows, goats or sheep? What were the animals fed? One of the most expensive types of cheese, (if not the most expensive) Caciocavallo Podolico, is made from the milk of cows that graze on the grasses and berries of the Italian Lucianan Mountains. It is expensive because it is rare.\nBut don\u2019t let that sway you from trying something new and foreign in the world of cheese. A really rewarding and relatively rare (in the U.S.) cheese is the semi-soft Halloumi, a salty white cheese native to Cyprus. Halloumi is processed like mozzarella and is made from sheep or goat milk, and sometimes a combination. Halloumi\u2019s versatility extends to its ability to hold its shape when fried or grilled.\nRaw Milk or Pasteurized?\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration gives strict warnings against consuming raw (unpasteurized) milk and cheese made from raw milk. Possible dangerous pathogens (such as salmonella and listeria) are killed during the pasteurization process.\nIn the U.S., it is illegal to import raw milk cheese that has not been aged longer than 60 days, a time in which most harmful pathogens die off. The same law applies for cheese made and sold within the U.S. Exceptions might be made for the sale of raw milk depending on each state\u2019s laws.\nCheese lovers hate this law. Yes, it is possible to get sick from unpasteurized products, but connoisseurs point to the hundreds of years cheese makers have followed the same procedures and recipes with raw milk in Europe. The FDA compares consuming raw milk products to playing Russian roulette; cheese aficionados believe if it were that risky, nobody would be eating.\nWhy all the fuss? It is all in the taste. Pasteurization kills the good as well as the bad bacteria. Good bacteria is essential for the subtle and not-so-subtle nuances of flavor in cheese. It makes such a difference that raw milk cheese is considered \u201calive\u201d and pasteurized cheese is \u201cdead.\u201d Happily, aged cheeses can be enjoyed in the U.S. with no restrictions. But, if you want an authentic French chevre (fresh goat cheese), you may have to plan a cheese vacation to Europe.\nArmed with your new knowledge of the types of cheese, make your way to a cheese shop and talk to the cheese monger (the term for a knowledgeable seller of cheese). He or she will guide you in sampling and finding a cheese you like.\nHow Much Do You Know About Food?\nYou know that brownies taste better when they're just out of the oven and that cranberry sauce will taste bitter if you don't add enough sugar.

Their \u00c9poisses comes in two sizes: Large (about 10-12\u201d in diameter) and small (about 4\u201d in diameter). The latter is what you usually see for sale whole in individual wooden boxes. If you see a piece of cut Epoisses for sale it is likely cut from the larger size rounds.\n\u00c9poisses is a washed rind cheese (the rind is orange) and this cheese is washed in Marc de Bourgogne as they are aged. It is almost the extreme of stinky cheeses and noted for it\u2019s creamy interior that at room temperature can be runny and spoonable (if the cheese is of the right age). When buying press lightly on the center \u2013 usually where the label is. If the cheese is \u201cripe\u201d there should be a slight give. Firmer cheeses are younger and you get that runny result at room temperature.\nWhere to Buy it Online:\n"}, {"score": 1390.4792, "uuid": "c95a48e7-d9e1-51c4-8d04-ed9e0c59e3bc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1212wb-13-02180", "target_hostname": "www.neighborlyfarms.com", "target_uri": "http://www.neighborlyfarms.com/stpete.html", "page_rank": 1.1850237e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Where <em>Cheese</em> Comes From - St. Petersburg Times, June 25, 2006", "snippet": "Raw-milk: The USDA requires that all <em>cheese</em> made with raw or <em>unpasteurized</em> milk be aged for at least 60 days to kill any bacteria. <em>Cheese</em> made with <em>pasteurized</em> milk, such as Kraft singles, <em>does</em> not have to be aged, but its flavor will not change with time.", "explanation": null, "document": "orders / questions can be left on answering maching 24/7\nWHERE CHEESE COMES FROM\nSt. Petersburg Times - St. Petersburg, Fla.\nAuthor: JANET K. KEELER\nText Word Count: 1383\nDocument Text\nFreddy, the gray-and-white barn cat, greets us energetically as we prowl around the milking parlor at Taylor Farm. He leans into our hands, eager for a scratch under the chin. The second our car door opens, he jumps inside and curls up on a Florida State University sweatshirt.\nSunshine peeps from dusky clouds, which make good every now and then on their threat of sprinkles. It has been an unusually cool, wet spring in New England, and the sweatshirt is needed as a warm wrap more than as a bed for Freddy. But he's so sweet and so obviously content. We think about driving off with him.\nThe incessant rain has painted the Green Mountain State even more emerald, if that's possible. Queen Anne's lace grows tall along the roads, and blooming yellow rocket dots every wide-open space. When you see Holsteins and Guernseys grazing on fields of green, you've got to believe that happy cows come from Vermont, not California.\nWe've come here to taste artisan cheese, and on our first day we understand why people give up city life to milk goats, cows, sheep and even water buffalo in this rural heaven. It's peaceful and pretty, and there are no billboards anywhere hollering about a morning radio show or promising to cure our aching backs. Of course, it is June, and the snow is gone.\nThere are about 35 small producing artisan cheesemakers in Vermont, double the number of just five years ago. Some, like those at Taylor Farm in Londonderry (Freddy's home) and Neighborly Farms in Randolph Center, produce farmstead cheese, which means that the milk comes from animals on the premises.\nCheesemakers are scattered around the state, from Alburg on the Grand Isle of northern Lake Champlain just miles from Canada, down to Woodstock, where water buffalo graze near the weekend playground of tony New Yorkers. They are making cheese near the granite quarries of Barre and in the rugged Northeast Kingdom.\nMany open their doors to visitors to sample cheeses with fanciful names such as Gore-Dawn-Zola, Magic Mountain and Bayley Hazen Blue. If you come at the right time, you can watch curds being separated from whey and then glimpse where the raw-milk cheese is brined and aged. It's like an old-school junior high film strip, come to life.\nAnd in between nibble stops, you can prowl through antique stores or, perched in a wooden gazebo in a quaint town square, watch village life go by. Tracking down dairy farms and cheesemakers will get you off the roads most traveled for sure, and could even send you over Sunset Lake on the famous floating bridge in Brookfield, which is buoyed by 380 barrels. You hope.\nTraveling the Vermont Cheese Trail - yes, there is such a thing - today is much like tasting wine in Napa Valley 30 years ago. The public relations companies and tourism boards have yet to exploit the movement, and the experience is grass roots, which means your tour guide will be a farmer in rubber boots or a cheesemaker wearing a hair net.\nDon't expect it to stay that way forever. The romance of artisan cheese will catch the fancy of slick ad agencies, the way winemaking has, and they will figure out a compelling way for us to add cheese to the list of reasons to visit Vermont. Fall foliage, covered bridges and steepled churches, skiing, maple syrup and now, handmade cheese.\nAlready, Vermont artisan cheeses are mainstays in renowned cheese shops such as Murray's in New York and Formaggio Kitchen in Boston and at natural foods mecca Whole Foods. Cheesemakers, professional and amateur, are using vacation time to take classes at the Vermont Institute for Artisan Cheese at the University of Vermont in Burlington. The Vermont Cheese Council, a nonprofit consortium of the state's cheesemakers, publishes a Vermont Cheese Trail map and provides profiles of the artisans on its Web site ( www.vtcheese.com ). (Even with map in hand, directions from a helpful clerk at a country store will be necessary.)\nMight artisan cheeses boost tourism the way they have the income of some farmers? Artisan cheeses, says the university's food safety and nutrition professor Catherine Donnelly, are a bright light in a dismal dairy economy. Farmers are getting $11 to $13 for 100 pounds of fluid milk, which it costs them about $18 to produce. When they make cheese from that milk, its price can hit as much as $40 for the same amount.\nDonnelly, who is also co-director of the artisan cheese institute, says the interest in cheese is fueled, in part, by Americans who have been to Europe and eaten locally produced, full- flavored food. They want better cheeses, and those that come individually wrapped don't cut it.\nSurprisingly, Vermont's restaurants seem slow to catch on to the bounty in their back yards. Vermont Cheddar, made really famous by Cabot, graces many menus, but we found few taking advantage of other local cheese, strong or subtle. Blue cheese goes unnamed on burgers even though the American Cheese Society has proclaimed several Vermont blues among the best in the land. The nation's oldest cheese producer, Crowley, produces award-winning Colby in a brown, clapboard 1880s factory in Healdville, but we never saw that screaming from a menu.\nWe found the best showcase for Vermont cheese at Smokejacks restaurant and bar in Burlington, which offers a well-rounded selection, including a creamy triple cream from Champlain Valley Creamery in Vergennes that will make you weep. For $10.95, we got the triple cream, plus a Jasper Hill blue and an aged Cheddar-gouda- like offering from La Fromagerie du Royaume. Dried apricots, candied pistachios and pecans, thin slices of green apple and toasted baguette slices accompanied them.\nWe were near the end of our five-day Vermont cheese tour when we stumbled on Smokejacks, which sits on a corner of a four-block pedestrian shopping mall downtown. The crowded restaurant was confirmation that good food, artisan food, does attract clientele. Especially those who have seen it at the source.\nImagine, the milking parlor where Freddy the cat hung out was the start of something great.\nJanet K. Keeler can be reached at (727) 893-8586 or jkeeler@sptimes.com.\nSAY CHEESE\nArtisan: Cheese that is made by hand, usually in small quantities. Large-scale operations, such as Kraft and Land O'Lakes, produce cheese mostly by machine.\nFarmstead: The milk comes from the farm where the cheese is made.\nOrganic: The animals producing the milk eat only organic feed that contains no pesticides.\nRaw-milk: The USDA requires that all cheese made with raw or unpasteurized milk be aged for at least 60 days to kill any bacteria. Cheese made with pasteurized milk, such as Kraft singles, does not have to be aged, but its flavor will not change with time.\nIF YOU GO\nGETTING THERE: Delta has a direct flight from Tampa to Hartford, Conn., which is convenient to southern and central Vermont. A number of carriers fly to Burlington from Tampa with one stop, providing easy access to the state's northern regions.\nACCOMMODATIONS: Vermont is awash with quaint B&Bs and inns but not many major hotel chains, unless you are in Burlington, Montpelier or Brattleboro. Some inns are good for children, others are not (especially those without TVs, and there are many). For suggestions, go to www.vtliving.com/lodging. The Shire Riverview Motel in Woodstock (46 Pleasant St.; (802) 457-2211 or www.shiremotel.com) combines some of the charms of a B&B with modern conveniences and a wonderful view of the Ottauquechee River. Rates are $150 to $200 a night.\nWHEN TO GO: Fall is for foliage fans and winter is for snow sports enthusiasts. Late spring and summer are the best times to visit cheesemakers.\nPLACES TO VISIT: The Vermont Cheese Council's cheese trail map can be downloaded free at www.vtcheese.com, or call Cabot Cheese at (802) 371-1265 to ask for one to be sent to you. Not all operations are open to the public, and it is a good idea to call ahead for those that are to ask about hours, directions and cheesemaking schedules.\nVermont Country Store, 1292 Rockingham Road, Rockingham, (802) 463-2224 or www.vermontcountrystore.com.\nBrattleboro Food Coop, 2 Main St., Brattleboro, (802) 257-0236 or www.brattleborofoodcoop.com.\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

(US Census Bureau 1997 population estimate 267,783,607)\nOTHER FOODS: Based on CDC website of reported food-borne illness from other foods \u00c2\u0096 6.4 cases per 100,000 people, per year from 1993-1997.\nTHEREFORE, the incidence of food-borne illness from consuming raw milk is 2.5 times lower than the incidence of food-borne illness from consuming pasteurized milk; and 3.5 times lower than the incidence of food-borne illness from consuming other foods.\nOn a case-by-case basis, persons consuming milk from ANY source (raw or pasteurized) are:\n30 times more likely to become ill from fruits and vegetables\n13 times more likely to become ill from beef\n11 times more likely to become ill from chicken\n10 times more likely to become ill from potato salad\n2.7 times more likely to become ill from non-dairy beverages\nSource: MMWR Vol 45, No SS-5\nGiven, from the above, that \"Of All Foods, Milk has the Lowest Incidence of Reported Food-Borne Illnesses (0.2%)\" ; and that the actual milk in question was never tested for bacteria as the source still was only alleged - the jump to the conclusion that the milk was the source for these illnesses by the so called experts is nothing short of hearsay masquerading as \"expert science\".\nInstead of doing some research on the issue Dr. Sarah Wilson, of University of Guelph, has the audacity to parrot the party line and then added insult to injury by stating, on April 15, 2005, CBC Ontario Today radio interview that except for Vitamin C pasteurizing essentially does not damage milk...\nFrom the above, pasteurization not only destroys vitamin C but also the B complex , D (a questionable version of synthetic D is often added), the minerals Zinc , Iron, Copper, enzymes and whey proteins.\nWith this kind of processing of food, along with our highly depleted soils , the quack medical Mafia and there supporters tell us that we get all our nutrients from food!\nThis struggle is about our health and not pseudo science to protect the status quo.

Price Foundation\nWe continually hear from the so called experts particularly HC that their decisions are based on science and risk reward ratios. This example demonstrates it is anything but science and risk is higher than reward - clearly what they aspire and what they do is totally opposite! Typically these publicly paid experts behave as though they are representing the industry instead of the their constituents. A clear demonstration how vested interests and status quo is maintained though self serving regulatory bloat and inbred lack of accountabilities. The only recourse left it seems is via the courts unless they too are bought!\nIt is truly a disgrace that, lay unpaid health conscious, citizens can research and find information central to their health while the so called experts who we pay handsomely to protect our health (Health Canada, Ontario's chief medical officer of health and a Food Safety Network) seem to be so inept in looking after their constituents with the very services they where hired to provide...\nChris Gupta\nFeb 23, 2005 Letter from Paul Mayers,\nHealth Canada\n\u00c2\u0093pasteurization kills the organisms that cause disease\u00c2\u0094\nPasteurization does NOT kill all the organisms that cause disease.\nFails to define acceptable risk nor apply it to both raw and pasteurized milk.\n\u00c2\u0093Listeria monocytogenes may contaminate between 1 and 10% of the raw milk supply\u00c2\u0094\nThese figures apply to regular bulk tank milk destined for pasteurization; they do not apply to Grade A certified milk for raw milk consumption.\n\u00c2\u0093It can result in still birth or miscarriage if pregnant women become infected.\u00c2\u0094\nPregnant women are much more likely to become infected from other foods than from raw milk.\nParagraph 3 lists outbreaks of foodborne illness \u00c2\u0091associated\u00c2\u0092 with raw milk.\nMost occurred in farms where there are many sources of infection.

She covered the following topics:\n- Health benefits of raw versus pasteurized milk\n- Safety of raw versus pasteurized milk and milk products\n- Legal issues\n- Trends in various US states and overseas\n- Comments on Paul Mayers letter of Feb 23/05 to Dr. Gould\nMarcus Koenig then described the ready availability of raw milk in Switzerland and Austria. He was a Swiss national before immigrating to Canada. He presented a picture of a consumer raw milk vending machine, which are in common use there and described its operation.\nJohn Sorchen grew up in Austria where he pasteurized raw milk for family consumption. He firmly believes in pasteurization but wants to do it himself rather than commercially because the milk tastes much better. He finds it difficult to buy raw milk in Canada, unlike in his native Austria because of farmers fear of the present law. He presented a $30 double-walled aluminum pot that he uses for home pasteurization. It is designed specifically for home pasteurization and heats to the correct temperature without risk of boiling over.\nJames McLaren presented a 1-page summary of the major aspects of raw milk distribution that would need to be addressed for thorough regulation in a Canadian context. He then restated his earlier proposal for Health Canada to study a Canadian dairy farm that distributes 70.000 litres annually of raw milk and dairy products.\nMr. Mayers advised that if he knew of such an operation he would be obliged to notify the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for enforcement action. Mr. McLaren advised that this raw milk distribution was done legally under a cow sharing program. Mr. Mayers asked if the consumers under this program actually owned a cow or a share of a cow because Health Canada\u00c2\u0092s interpretation was that the former was legal but not the latter. Mr. McLaren said he was not sure.\nHealth Canada inquired about the sources for the Canadian epidemiological data that was presented.\nThe prevalence and trends of consumer raw milk consumption was discussed.\nAt one point, Ms. Fallon inquired how Health Canada ensured the public safety of raw oysters. Mr. Mayers responded that it was through public education. Mr. McLaren inquired how effective that was and Mr. Mayers said that public education was an effective risk management tool.\nMr. Mayers assured that Health Canada\u00c2\u0092s regulatory policies and procedures were based on science and that any changes would be so based.\nThrough discussion and inquiry, Health Canada indicated that the introduction of raw milk for consumer sale would have to follow their standard procedures for the introduction of a \u00c2\u0093novel food\u00c2\u0094 into the marketplace. The framework for this application could be developed in one of two ways \u00c2\u0096 either wait for Health Canada to develop it, which might take some time given their priorities, or the Coalition could propose a framework for Health Canada\u00c2\u0092s review and comment which would be an iterative process until satisfactory to both sides.\nIt was suggested that the framework could be developed first before any money was spent on the study itself. A primary concern for Health Canada was microbial hazards and tests would have to be submitted to prove safety. Health Canada made it clear that they would not base a decision on epidemiological data, but wanted analyses of raw milk for pathogens.\nMr. Mayers then left the meeting at 20 minutes beyond its original conclusion time.\nDiscussion continued around further details of the framework elements. The Coalition suggested comparative tests with pasteurized milk and soy and juice products, as well as challenge test with raw and pasteurized milk. Based on the discussions, Ms. Fallon also suggested that the direct sales model contained in the Pennsylvania regulations might serve as a favorable regulatory model. Health Canada felt that the inclusion of both of these suggestions in a proposed framework or study would not be viewed unfavorably.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnpasteurized Milk\nby:Sandy Mowat\nA number of people in the Barrie area have become ill after drinking unpasteurized milk.

Every small batch begins with milk from Beyond Organic dairy cattle that forage on their natural diet of lush greens in certified organic pastures \u0096 producing dairy with a unique and impressive nutritional composition. Allow your self to indulge in the complex flavors that only come from Beyond Organic\u0092s farmstead, artisanal cheese, that is not only delicious but loaded with Omega-3\u0092s, conjugated linolenic acid (CLA ), probiotics and other health promoting nutrients.\nWhat Makes Beyond Organic GreenFed Raw Cheese So Unique?\nReally Raw\u0097Beyond Organic uses only unpasteurized and untreated true whole milk that is never heated above cow body temperature (around 101.5\u00b0 Fahrenheit)\nGreenFed\u0097Beyond Organic\u0092s dairy cattle intensely graze on grasses and greens such as forbs, herbs and legumes\u0097no grain\u0097while free-roaming our thousands of acres of organic pasture in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains.

Its versatility is undeniable. A simple tray of cheese set out prior to eating transforms a meal into a party. Melted over vegetables, it turns picky children into connoisseurs. Served at the end of a meal it can elicit wonder and awe\u0097a pre-postprandial indulgence. Yet, some cheese does disappoint.\nOnce the providence of artisanal craftsman, cheese entered the mainstream years ago. Bricks and slices inhabit miles of space in grocery stores around the country. It is a testament to our love of cheese\u0097any cheese\u0097that such a sight exists. If you\u0092ve ever had a bite of truly artisanal cheese, you know that it satisfies on a different plane than the mass produced \u0093wall of cheese\u0094 in your local supermarket.\nAt Beyond Organic, we don\u0092t love cheese. We love great cheese! Our decision to craft cheese was a natural one, but it was not an easy one. A commitment to great cheese is a commitment to travelling back in time. The two most important ingredients today are the same as they were 2,000 years ago\u0097great milk and lots of time. Mass produced cheese rarely uses either\u0097and the proof is in the flavor.\nThe Art in Artisanal\nA great sculptor can take a simple piece of bronze and shape it into art. Cheese making is a similarly transformative process. It requires taking a precious ingredient\u0097raw, whole milk\u0097and using artistic craftsmanship applied over time, creating a product that is fundamentally different than the milk that you started with. It is a process that is best described as art\u0097hence, the term artisanal.\nAt Beyond Organic, our cheese starts with one of our most precious resources\u0097our milk. Much like cheese, the startling majority of milk consumed in the United States is mass produced. It\u0092s hard to create great art with factory farm milk. Our milk comes from GreenFed cows allowed to freely roam green pastures, sampling from Nature\u0092s buffet. The grass, herbs, forbs and legumes they eat are their natural diet\u0097what cows have been consuming for thousands of years.\nThe milk from these Beyond Organic dairy cows produce is unparalleled in both health benefits and flavor. It has a healthy ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty aicds. It has vitamin E and beta carotene. Our GreenFed dairy also contains conjugated linolenic acid (CLA)\u0097 a fatty acid that has been the subject of a substantial amount of research over the last several years. Our Beyond Organic cows are never given antibiotics or growth hormones, and the land they graze is certified organic and is never sprayed with chemicals. The milk is rich and creamy, and it tastes unlike any milk found in supermarkets today. If milk can be artisanal, ours is. It\u0092s also the ideal starting point for a great cheese.\nFrom there, our artisanal cheese maker takes over. The milk is allowed to settle, with the whey rising to the top and the curd remaining on the bottom. The whey\u0097liquid gold in its own right\u0097is siphoned off, cultures are added and the curd is pressed into wheel-shaped molds. The cultures will dominate the aging process and determine the type of cheese created.\nThe above description is overly simplistic. There are variables that only God controls and that is the true art of cheese making. Our cows\u0092 diets change throughout the year\u0097different greens grow at different times of the year. Milk taken from the cows in January may have slight taste differences than milk taken in August\u0097subtly changing the end product of the cheese. Additionally, we never pasteurize our milk\u0097it is never heated above cow body temperature (around 101.5\u00b0 Fahrenheit). This is what we refer to as Really Raw. Mass producers of cheese love pasteurized milk because it delivers a uniform flavor and texture every time. Finally, how long you age the cheese will also affect the end result. Our cheese is ready when it\u0092s ready\u0097and that is exactly the way we want it.\nThese variables are an abhorrence to the factories that mass produce cheese. They want their cheese to taste exactly the same every day of the year. That is why they ultra-heat pasteurize the milk and age the cheese the exact same way every time. At Beyond Organic, that will never be our goal. If our cheese tastes different from batch to batch, then we know we are practicing the art of cheese making. Taste is subjective, and you may prefer one batch to another, but the cheese will always be great.\nArt You Can Eat\nCheddar cheese is perhaps the most ubiquitous of cheeses. It is the most populous inhabitant of the aforementioned \u0093wall of cheese.\u0094 Unfortunately, the insipid flavor and texture of mass-produced cheddar cheese comically undervalues the true greatness of cheddar. This is a particular shame. True cheddar cheese (the name is derived from cheddar\u0092s origin, the English village of Cheddar in Somerset) was once described by the \u0093father of Cheddar cheese,\u0094 Joseph Harding, as \u0093close and firm in texture, yet mellow in character or quality; it is rich with a tendency to melt in the mouth, the flavour full and fine. . .\u0094 That hardly seems like the description one would use to describe run-of-the-mill mass-produced cheddar cheese.\nincluding the GreenFed Raw Cheddar Cheese.\nBeyond Organic Raw Cheddar is what artisanal cheese is supposed to be. It is pleasingly sharp, with a crumbly texture, and a richness and complexity of flavor that can be found only in a raw milk, aged cheese. Once you taste the flavor and experience the health benefits, you\u0092ll find it hard to go back to the processed cheddar so prevalent in stores today.\nHavarti cheese is an altogether different cheese. Havarti is a Danish cheese that first came to be in the mid-1800s. Much like cheddar cheese, what once started out as a uniquely artisanal tradition has been forsaken in the name of commerce. Originally, havarti cheese was made from raw milk. Today, much of the havarti that you find is known as \u0093cream havarti.\u0094 It uses highly pasteurized milk and is barely aged. It doesn\u0092t compare in craftsmanship, texture or flavor to the original.\nincluding the GreenFed Raw Havarti Cheese.\nOur Beyond Organic Raw Havarti is aged to create a pliable, semi-soft texture. It has a rich, almost buttery flavor with just a hint of tanginess. It is also versatile\u0097great sliced and wonderful toasted or melted, where the buttery flavor becomes even more pronounced. It is the mildest of our cheeses and a great entry into the world of artisanal cheese making.\n"}, {"score": 1125.8883, "uuid": "b6e4fcc7-f090-5f73-a854-8cf8c11dfe2b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400tw-64-14785", "target_hostname": "www.thenewstribune.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thenewstribune.com/2012/04/06/2097361/news-brief-06gocheesefests.html", "page_rank": 1.1814322e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "Inaugural festival features South Sound artisans, <em>cheese</em> | Food - The News", "snippet": "One percent of the dairy consumed in the United States over that period was <em>unpasteurized</em>, meaning that the rate of raw-milk outbreaks was 150 times greater <em>than</em> the rate of diseases stemming from <em>pasteurized</em> milk, according to the CDC.", "explanation": null, "document": "Text\nInaugural festival features South Sound artisans, cheese\nA feast of cheese Washington beer festival, wine weekends \u2013 there are plenty of both in the region.

Many distinctions exist, and there are many considerations. For example, Gorgonzola can fall into the washed-rind category or the semi-soft or semi-hard category, depending on its age and whether it is a Gorgonzola dolce or a Gorgonzola piccante. Simultaneously, it can be classified as a blue-veined cheese or even just an aged, ripened, or cured cheese, as opposed to a fresh cheese. To add further to the confusion, it may have been made in Italy or in the United States. So there really are many possibilities.\nAn easy way to approach this dilemma is to group cheeses into families according to their textures: soft, semi-soft, semi-firm, hard, and extra-hard. This would seem simple. However, soon you begin to realize that cheeses change and evolve during their lives, developing completely different textures. For instance, a cheese such as a Crottin de Chavignol begins soft but eventually becomes rock-hard with age. The flavors also change as a cheese matures, moving from mild to sharp. The exterior of a cheese undergoes many changes as well. Crottins, for example, begin without a rind and in time mature to have a moldy, crusty, dry blue rind.\nAnother approach is to classify cheeses by ripening method, in categories such as fresh, surface-ripened, and so on. They can be classified according to taste, such as mild to strong. A completely different system is to classify cheeses by country of origin. What then do you do, though, about the different Gruy\u00e8res that are produced in Switzerland, France, Germany, Australia, and even the United States? Should you just call all cheeses of this type mountain cheeses, since they all originated in mountainous regions? Similarly, there could be a category for the monastery cheeses that originated in monasteries during the Middle Ages. And yet another category might be table cheeses, cheeses that are used daily for eating and cooking. There seem to be as many methods of classification are there are cheeses.\nThe classification system that seems to make the most sense for me is to go by texture with subclassifications of ripening methods, veining, and other distinguishing characteristics, such as pasta filata cheeses, whey cheeses, and high butterfat cheeses. I have developed some tables (see the Cheese Tables beginning on page 351) in which cheeses are sorted according to texture, flavor, and country of origin.\nSoft Fresh Cheeses\nSoft cheeses are usually mild and milky in flavor. These are fresh cheeses that are just a step away from being milk. They do not go through a ripening period or maturing process. Simple and delicate, they are often unsalted, and some are even considered bland. They are best consumed soon after they are made. Among the most popular is Cottage Cheese, made of skimmed-milk curds mixed with cream. Fromage Blanc, or Fromage Frais, is fresh, very soft, barely coagulated lactic curds that have been quickly drained and sometimes whipped. The Germans have a similar cheese called Quark. Cream Cheese is a somewhat drier fresh cheese made creamy and smooth with the addition of cream. Commercial renditions are whipped and stabilized with gums, but artisanal cream cheese can be found every now and then.\nFrom northern Italy comes Crescenza or Stracchino, so called because it was originally made from the rich milk of cows who had just come down from a summer of mountain-top grazing. This cheese, a younger cousin of Taleggio and Gorgonzola, is quite mild and creamy. A similar cheese that also comes from northern Italy is Robiola.\nFarmer Cheese can take several forms: It can be a crumbly cheese of curds similar to cottage cheese, without the cream. It can be drained in a basket or mold. Or it can be pressed into a cake for slicing. Mexican Queso Fresco or Queso Blanco is quite similar to farmer cheese or pot cheese, but it is pressed into a disk shape.\nSemi-Soft Cheeses\nCheeses that fall into this category are often buttery and mild in flavor. They are good table cheeses.\nBel Paese, a popular semi-soft cheese, originated in northern Italy. Bel paese means \"beautiful country,\" and the cheese is named for a book written by Antonio Stoppani; the name is a trademark of the Galbani company. Stoppani's portrait and a map of Italy are on the label of the cheese made in Italy, while the American-made version has a map of the Western hemisphere on its label. Quite similar are Caciottas, small cheeses that are made on farms by artisanal cheesemakers. In Italy, they are sold still fresh, usually at about ten days, when they are relatively bland. In Tuscany, small Caciottas are made from sheep milk and called Pecorino Toscano.\nFrom the Low Countries comes Havarti, created by pioneer cheesemaker Hanne Nielsen in the mid-1800s. It has lots of tiny irregular eyes and is often flavored with herbs or spices. The original Havarti was a washed-rind cheese. It is quite similar to German Tilsit.\nTomme de Savoie is semi-soft when young but becomes firm with age. Many other washed-rind cheeses also fit into this category because they are usually semi-soft in texture.\nSemi-Firm Cheeses\nMost cheeses in this category are pressed to become firm. They are often mild when young, becoming more and more flavorful as they age. They also become much harder as they age, and some, like Gouda, eventually move into the extra-hard family. When young, they are very good table cheeses, which means that they are good for cooking and for eating as snacks and in sandwiches. Some of the cheeses have small irregular eyes, others do not.\nFrom Italy come Asiago, a strongly flavored cheese with irregular holes; Fontina, a marvelous melting cheese; and Montasio, another good melting variety. Another interesting cheese that falls into this category is Umbriaco, which means \"drunkard.\" It has been soaked in wine and matured with a coating of grape skins and seeds so that its rind is stained purple. From Holland come Edam, a small round cheese that is often coated with red wax, and Gouda, a larger and more complex cheese. Mah\u00f3n comes from the island of Minorca. It's a very attractive cheese with a rind that has been rubbed with olive oil and paprika. Morbier is a French cheese that has a layer of ash running through the middle of the cheese, which traditionally separated the curds from the morning and evening milkings.\nT\u00eate de Moine, whose name means monk's head, is a semi-firm cheese from Switzerland. The cheese is eaten by scraping off layers from the top using a girolle, a device with a rotating blade that leaves the cheese resembling the bald spot on a monk's head. Raclette is another Swiss cheese. Traditionally it is served by placing it near a fire so that the face of the cheese softens and melts from the heat. It is then scraped off onto a plate and eaten with boiled new potatoes, pickled onions, and cornichons, tiny gherkin pickles. Morbier can also be enjoyed in this same way.\nDry Jack, also known as Dry Sonoma Jack, is a California cheese that fits into this category because it begins as a mild cheese and hardens with age to become a drier and more flavorful cheese.\nCheddar-Style Hard Cheeses\nAll cheeses in this family go through the cheddaring process, in which the curds are cut into pieces and stacked in the cheese vat to drain and mat together. The cheeses are firm-textured and have a clean, mellow taste when young, becoming sharp and tangy with age.\nCheeses in this family include first, of course, Cheddar. Cheddar is so named because it was originally made in the town of Cheddar in England. It is a cheese that dates back to ancient times. Although it originated in England, it is now made all over the world, from New Zealand to Canada to South Africa to the United States. The finest Cheddars are traditionally made from unpasteurized milk and bound in cloth to age. Cheddars can be aged from three months to three years, the longer, the more flavorful. Two famous farmhouse English Cheddars are Keen and Montgomery. Tillamook in Oregon makes a fine Cheddar, as do Cabot, Grafton, and Shelburne Farms in Vermont.\nColby, invented in Colby, Wisconsin, around the turn of the century, is similar to Cheddar but softer, milder, and moister, with a more open texture. Longhorn is Colby made in a long tubular shape.\nAnother cheese that belongs in the Cheddar family is Cheshire, which is claimed to be England's oldest cheese. Cheshire is aged for only one to two months and does not store well. It is a good cooking cheese and, in fact, was the original cheese used for Welsh rarebit. Its flavor works well with eggs, especially in souffl\u00e9s. Blue Cheshire has dark green-blue veins. Stilton also falls into the Cheddar family, as does Gloucester, which is a bright orange cheese that is aged for six to nine months. There are two types: Single Gloucester, made from partially skimmed milk, which is softer and milder, and Double Gloucester, made from whole milk, which is mellow, creamy, and stronger. A striking and lovely cheese is Huntsman, Gloucester with bands of Stilton in the middle. Another English cheese that is great for melting is Lancashire, which is made from curds combined from several days of milkings. And from Wales comes Caerphilly, another moist, crumbly cheese that is good for melting. Caerphilly is sold quite young.\nCantal, a cheese that has been made in southern France for centuries, is also made with the cheddaring method. When young, it is very similar to a Lancashire; when aged, it is very much like a Cheddar.\nHard Cheeses with Eyes\nMost of the cheeses in this category were originally made in mountainous regions of Europe, mostly by farmers in isolated mountain houses. Their curds are all cooked and then pressed and aged, so these cheeses are more solid. Their interiors are dotted with holes (eyes) created by a gas that develops within the cheese during the ripening process. The gas is actually natural carbon dioxide that is given off with the growth of Propionibacter shermanii bacteria. Often these cheeses have tough, hard rinds.\nEmmental is the cheese commonly called Swiss cheese. It has olive-shaped eyes that can be as large as a walnut. Law dictates that it cannot be exported until it is four months old. Some cheeses are gigantic and weigh almost three hundred pounds. The Norwegians created a similar cheese in the mid-1950s called Jarlsberg. It is claimed to be the most popular imported cheese in the United States.\nSeveral cheeses fall into the Gruy\u00e8re family. First and foremost is Swiss Gruy\u00e8re. It is softer and smoother than Emmental and considered to be a better cooking cheese. The finest Gruy\u00e8re has a slight dampness in its pea-sized eyes. The French cheese Beaufort, known as the Prince of Gruy\u00e8res, is higher in butterfat than most Gruy\u00e8res and has a sticky moist rind from the bacteria linens. Comt\u00e9, also known as Gruy\u00e8re de Comt\u00e9, has been made in France since the thirteenth century. It has marble-shaped holes. Younger cheeses have a floral aroma, while older cheeses have a farmyard character. Appenzell is sharper than Gruy\u00e8re and has an even more pungent farmyard aroma. During its aging period, it is washed with wine, spices, and salt. It has small, irregular pea-sized holes.\nExtra-Hard Cheeses\nCheeses in this category are all of the grating variety. They are very hard and very low in moisture, and they have a brittle texture. Mellow, robust, and sweet, they sometimes become sharp and piquant with age. They have all been cooked and then pressed and aged for years so they become hard and dry. Because they are so old, they often develop crystalline bits of casein that crunch when you bite on them.\nParmigiano-Reggiano is known as the the King of Cheeses. It has been made since ancient times. Boccaccio even wrote of a mountain of Parmigiano in The Decamaron in the fourteenth century. Produced in a restricted geographic region in Italy from the milk of specific cows during a specific period of the year, Parmigiano is graded throughout its aging process. According to set standards, true Parmesan cheeses are sold at different ages, called Giovane (young) at fourteen months; Vecchio (old), eighteen months to two years; Stravecchio (extra old), two to three years; and Stravecchione (very old), three to four years. Grana Padano is made in northwestern Italy. It is made just like Parmigiano, except in a different region. It is often sold when young; however, when aged for two or three years, it is very similar in taste and texture to Parmigiano. Pecorino Romano is a sheep milk cheese made near Rome and also in Sardinia. It is said to be Italy's oldest cheese. It is a good table cheese when young and develops into a very hard, sharp, and piquant cheese as it ages. Locatelli is a brand of Pecorino Romano.\nSbrinz, the oldest of the Swiss cheeses, is a very hard cheese of which Pliny wrote. It is similar in flavor to Parmigiano and wonderful for grating. Another unique Swiss cheese that falls into this extra-hard category is Sapsago. It is a pressed cheese made from cow's milk. Its pale green color comes from melilot, an herb that strongly and assertively flavors the cheese. This herb, which grows only in the area where the cheese is made, is thought to have been brought back from Asia Minor by the crusaders.\nBloomy-Rind and Soft-Ripened Cheeses\nCheeses in this category have rinds covered with a thin layer of a white mold, known as a bloomy down or flowery rind. To achieve this coating, the surfaces of the cheeses have been treated with a mold called Penicillium candidum, which develops into a white crust. Most of these cheeses are soft. Their interiors soften as they age, becoming creamy and sometimes thick and runny. The cheeses ripen from the outer edge to the center, so you can determine if a cheese is mature by lightly touching the center of the cheese to see if it is soft. The cheeses are tangy and rich, yet delicate and luscious. Their flavors become fuller with age. The white rind is edible, but if you don't like it, just cut it off and discard it.\nThe most famous bloomy-rind cheeses are Brie and Camembert. The most magnificent Brie of all is Brie de Meaux, which is farm-made in France from unpasteurized milk, and therefore seldom found in the United States. It has a satiny and silky texture and is runny when mature. It has an impressive history. Charlemagne was quite taken with it, as, centuries later, was the French diplomat Talleyrand, who declared it \"the King of Cheeses\" at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Most of the Bries imported into the United States are factory-made from pasteurized milk. They are much milder and do not mature like Brie de Meaux. Camembert is a similar cheese from Normandy, but it is smaller than Brie and has some brown mottling on the rind. Its flavor becomes more complex as it ages. Neither Brie nor Camembert should ever have an ammoniated aroma or taste. If they do, they are past their prime and you should not buy or eat them. Coulommiers is quite similar to Brie except that it is smaller in size and eaten at a younger age.\nMost bloomy-rind cheeses have a butterfat content of 45 to 50 percent. Some, however, are triple-cr\u00e8mes and have a butterfat content above 75 percent. These cheeses are exceedingly rich and luscious. They are almost like a mousse and literally melt in your mouth. They are wonderful with caviar as well as fresh fruit. The most famous of these are: Brillat-Savarin, named for the eighteenth-century writer and statesman who declared that \"a meal that ends without cheese is like a beautiful woman with only one eye\"; Explorateur, named for the Explorer satellite rocket that was fired in 1958; and Saint Andr\u00e9. These cheeses are a delicious, decadent addition to any cheese tray.\nBlue-Veined Cheeses\nBlue cheeses are among the most popular of all. Their blue interior veins and marbling are actually molds that range in color from blue to blue-green to blue-black. Some of the cheeses even have small pockets of mold throughout. All have been sprayed or inoculated with mold spores of Penicillium glaucum or Penicillium roqueforti. Sometimes the mold is incorporated into the cheese curds as well. During the aging process, the cheeses are pierced with wire needles to allow aerobic mold development throughout their interiors. Normally these cheeses ripen from the center out to the crust so that when they are fully mature the veining is well developed and well distributed throughout the cheese.\nBlue cheeses all have intense, strong, tangy flavors. Some have a pungent aroma. Some are semi-soft; others are semi-firm and crumbly. Others, such as Gorgonzola, are quite soft and creamy.\nThe most widely known of the blue-veined cheeses is Roquefort, which is made from sheep milk. It is a controlled-origin cheese that has been aged in the same limestone caves in Cambalou, near Roquefort, in southern France for over one thousand years. Charlemagne was quite enchanted with Roquefort. There are also delicious blue-veined French cheeses made with cow's milk, such as Bleu d'Auvergne, about which Pliny wrote in the first century, and Fourme d'Ambert, which has been made since the seventh century and is unusual because it has a crusty rind.\nEvery country has its own blue cheeses. In England, the most famous is Stilton, a cheese of ancient origin with a crumbly texture and a natural crust. Colston Basset is considered the finest and creamiest Stilton of all because it is made from unpasteurized milk. Another interesting English blue is Shropshire Blue, easily recognized by its intense orange color, which comes from annatto. It's sharper than Stilton and quite striking in appearance. From Ireland comes Cashel Blue, a cheese that is tangy and crumbly when young and softens as it ages. Cabrales is a powerful Spanish blue that is traditionally wrapped in sycamore leaves that impart a distinctly woody flavor. Italy's Gorgonzola is said to be the oldest named cheese, dating back to 879. Creamy and moist, it is made in the same way as Stracchino and Taleggio. In fact, the legend is that some Stracchino was forgotten and left in the storeroom of an inn in the town of Gorgonzola, where it developed mold. When the innkeeper served it to his guests rather than throw it away, it was such a hit that the practice of leaving the cheese to mold became a tradition.\nSeveral blue-veined cheeses are more recent additions to the world of cheese: Danish Blue was developed after World War I as an imitation of Bleu d'Auvergne. Maytag Blue, a cow's milk cheese made in Iowa since 1941, is based upon Roquefort. And Cambozola, which is made in Germany, is a rich and creamy Brie-type cheese with a bloomy rind and blue interior veining -- thus its name: camb for camembert and zola for Gorgonzola.\nPasta Filata Cheeses\nThese are cheeses with curds that have been heated, kneaded, pulled, and strung, or stretched, repeatedly in hot water to achieve an elastic consistency. Fresh cheeses of this family have an elastic texture and are quite springy to the touch. As they age, this elasticity decreases and the cheeses become softer, depending upon their moisture content.\nThe best-known cheese in this family is Mozzarella. There are actually two types of mozzarella: high-moisture mozzarella, a cheese with more than 52 percent moisture, commonly called fresh mozzarella, and low-moisture mozzarella, a drier and firmer cheese. Fresh mozzarella is like the cow's milk mozzarella found throughout Italy that is called fior di latte. Usually it can be purchased salted or unsalted. It is available in Italian delis and stores with specialty foods. It has a shorter shelf life than low-moisture mozzarella, a cheese that was developed in the United States to withstand transportation and storage for long periods of time. Low-moisture mozzarella is often shredded and used for pizza. In Italy, fior di latte is made from cow's milk, and mozzarella di bufala is made from water buffalo milk, with a higher butterfat content and a gamier taste. Mozzarella can be formed into small balls that are called bocconcini, and it can also be smoked. A specialty of southern Italy is fresh mozzarella formed around a lump of sweet cream butter, called burrata or burrino.\nIt is a misconception that fresh mozzarella should be purchased floating in its whey. Water is used in the manufacture of mozzarella, and once the cheese is strung with hot water, it is must be placed in cool water to firm and chill. Years ago, refrigeration was rare in Italy and the only way to keep the mozzarella cool was to surround it with fresh well water. Nowadays the tradition continues and often mozzarella is sold surrounded by liquid, but the longer the cheese remains in the liquid, the more whey leaches out of the cheese and into the water, thus giving it a milky appearance. Sometimes the liquid contains citric acid, which helps preserve the cheese. When fresh mozzarella is removed from the liquid and packaged, its texture and consistency will be slightly firmer, yet it has more flavor because its whey is not being continually leached out and replaced with water.\nScamorza and Provolone are the cheeses often hung from the rafters in Italian food shops. Scamorza is a small cheese that is firmer than fresh mozzarella. Creamy and mild, it is shaped like a pear with a little topknot. Sometimes it is smoked. Provolone is still firmer. It is usually formed into a bell or a sausage shape, some as large as eight hundred pounds, and hung to age. Provolone Piccante is made with kid lipase and rennet and is very sharp when aged. Caciocavallo is another pasta filata cheese that has been made since Roman times. Its name is said to come from the fact that two cheeses are tied together with raffia and hung over a pole to dry as if they were on horseback: cacio for \"cheese\" and cavallo for \"horse.\" Similar cheeses are made in other nearby countries: Kashkaval in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia and Kasseri in Greece.\nWashed-Rind Cheeses and Cheeses with Pungent Aromas\nThe cheeses in this group are all rubbed, brushed, or washed with a liquid while curing. The liquid can be brine, whey, or wine or spirits, and it fuels the growth of surface bacteria that affect the flavor of the cheeses. These cheeses are usually cured for longer periods than bloomy-rind cheeses. Some develop thick crusts and others have sticky surfaces that encourage the development of the linens bacteria, which causes them to become very pungent and powerful in aroma. Despite the fact that they are so stinky, they vary in taste, some having very strong and pronounced flavors, while others are surprisingly mild. Generally, washed-rind cheeses are semi-soft in texture; however, some become very soft and runny when mature. The development of many of these cheeses can be traced back to monastic orders during the Middle Ages; therefore they are sometimes referred to as monastery cheeses. The monks spent a great deal of time and effort developing these various cheeses, which have a range of flavors from mild and luscious to gutsy and even meaty.\nAmong the cheeses in this category is Brick cheese, which originated in Wisconsin before the turn of the century, in an attempt to recreate German Limburger. It was called brick cheese both because it is shaped like a brick and because it is pressed using bricks. Another American cheese in this family is Liederkranz, which originated in Ohio. It was meant to replicate German Schlossk\u00e4se. It is quite pungent, but less so than Limburger.\nThe French developed many of the washed-rind cheeses. They range in strength from mildly flavored cheeses to the strongest imaginable, often complete with aromas of barnyards and stables. Pont l'Ev\u00eaque, which is quite mild in flavor, is a monastery cheese; the first record of it dates to the thirteenth century. Reblochon, another monastery cheese, which dates back to the fifteenth century, also has a mild flavor. It was so named because it was made from milk that came from a second milking, reblochon, that occurred after the landlord had passed by to collect the milk that paid the rent. Port Salut, a mild and mellow cheese, was created by Trappist monks during the French Revolution. Munster, developed by the Benedictine monks in the seventh century, is mild in flavor when young but becomes very pungent -- and smells like a stable -- when old. Maroilles, created by monks in the tenth century, has a very pungent aroma but a medium-strong flavor. Livarot, which is strong and assertive in both flavor and aroma, is sometimes called \"the colonel\" because the strips of grass that encircle the cheese resemble the stripes on a colonel's uniform. The rind of Epoisses is washed with an eau-de-vie. It is very runny when ripe, has a pungent and barnyardy aroma, and is quite strongly flavored.\nLimburger, which was originated by Trappist monks in Belgium, is a very smelly cheese with a pronounced and pungent aroma. It is strongly flavored, but it does not taste as strong as it smells. Italian Taleggio has a pungent aroma and is very runny when mature but is relatively mellow in taste. Among the more mildly flavored washed-rind cheeses are Gubbeen and Milleens, from Ireland.\nVacherin Mont d'Or was traditionally made at home by Swiss farmers in the winter when it was so snowy in the mountains that they couldn't deliver their milk to the cheesemaking facilities. It is a very pungent, runny cheese that is contained within a thin strip of pine that encircles the cheese while aging. When mature, it has a strong, barnyardy flavor. It is best eaten in its box, by removing the top rind and scooping out the interior with a spoon.\nTriple-Cr\u00e8me Cheeses\nAll the cheeses in this group are exceedingly rich because cream is added to the milk to achieve a cheese with a butterfat content of 72 to 75 percent or more. They are all luscious, velvety and very creamy.\nSome, like Mascarpone and Boursin, are meant to be consumed when fresh. Technically speaking, mascarpone is not a cheese but rather clotted cream. It comes from northern Italy, where it is used in both sweet and savory dishes. French Boursin is a fresh triple-cr\u00e8me cheese that is often flavored with garlic and herbs.\nOther triple-cr\u00e8mes are aged for about three weeks. Among this group are Brillat-Savarin, Saint Andr\u00e9, and Explorateur, which are ripened with bloomy rinds, and the blue-veined Cambozola.\nWhey Cheeses\nThese cheeses are made from whey drained away from curds used to make another cheese and recooked to form a secondary cheese. Whey cheeses range from very soft, mild, and fresh to firm, aged, and sharp.\nTypically Ricotta is made from whey that comes from the curds used to make mozzarella. It can be made from cow's, sheep, goat, or water buffalo whey. The whey is boiled or recooked (thus the name ricotta, which means \"recooked\" in Italian). The curds are precipitated from the whey by the addition of an acid and then ladled into baskets to drain. Ricotta can be salted, pressed, and aged to become a firm, sharp cheese called Ricotta Salata. In Greece, a similarly made firm cheese is called Manouri. Mizithra, another Greek sheep milk-whey cheese, is both eaten when young like ricotta and aged.\nIn Norway, Gjetost is made by cooking whey from cow's milk or goat milk with sugar until it caramelizes and becomes dark golden brown.\nGoat Cheeses\nCh\u00e8vre is the generic name for all goat milk cheeses in France, and the name is widely used in the United States as well. There are said to be more than eighty varieties of goat cheese produced in France alone. They are made in all shapes and sizes, with various rinds and molds, and each has its own distinct characteristics and flavor. Many are rustic and homespun in appearance, with flavors that are earthy and tangy. Goat cheeses develop wonderful, pronounced, complex flavors when they age. The French are masters at affinage, which means aging. Often the young cheeses are sold to shopkeepers who age and coddle them until they are ready to sell.\nMontrachet, imported from France, is the most commonly found fresh goat cheese in the United States. It was named for the glorious Burgundian white wine of the same name. A soft fresh log of goat cheese, Montrachet is very mild in flavor and usually sold at an age of less than one month. Most Montrachet imported into the United States is factory-made, sometimes from dried milk or frozen curds. But there is an abundance of American-made goat cheese, and I urge you to seek out these cheeses rather than purchasing factory-made French Montrachet. The American-made cheeses are all finely made artisanal cheeses of high quality. Names you should look for are Laura Chenel, who pioneered American-made goat cheese in the 1980s; Capriole, from Kentucky; Cypress Grove, from California; Coach Farms, from New York; and Vermont Butter and Cheese Company.\nAnother oft-imported French goat cheese is Bucheron, a fat log of fresh goat cheese that has been coated with a bloomy rind and ripened. Sainte-Maure is a somewhat thinner log of goat cheese that is covered with ash, coated with a bloomy rind, and aged. Sainte-Maure from the Touraine is made with a long straw running inside the cheese to help hold it together. Selles-sur-Cher is a smaller round coated with ash. As it ages, a blue mold often grows under the ash.\nChabichou, which means \"little goat,\" is a cylindrical cheese with a bit of mold atop its white bloomy rind. Valen\u00e7ay is also known as Pyramide because of its flattened pyramid shape. It has a bloomy rind covered with ash. Crottin de Chavignol is a tiny round of goat cheese that is aged to become hard as a rock. (Then it really does resemble the animal dropping for which it is named.)\nBanon, named for a town in Provence, is unique in that it is first dipped in eau-de-vie and then wrapped in a chestnut leaf to cure. Banons can be made from any milk, but they are usually associated with goat milk. When made from cow's milk, they may be called Saint-Marcellin.\nMany other cheeses are produced from goat milk, including Arina, a goat milk Cheddar from Holland, Gjetost, and Feta, to name only a few.\nSheep Milk Cheeses\nThe generic name for all sheep milk cheeses in France is brebis. In Italy, the term used is pecorino. Since sheep milk has two to three times the butterfat of cow's milk, all sheep milk cheeses are exceedingly smooth and rich. Cheeses made from sheep milk come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and types and range in flavor from mild to sharp.\nThere are some delightful young sheep milk cheeses made in Italy, especially in Tuscany and Umbria, where they are called Pecorino or Pecorino Toscano. There are also many sheep milk cheeses in Sardinia and Sicily, which makes one of my favorites, Pepato, which is studded with black peppercorns. Pecorino Romano, which is commonly found in the United States, has been made in the countryside around Rome for the last two thousand years. When young, it is a table cheese, and when aged it is hard, sharp, and piquant and an excellent grating cheese.\nBrin d'Amour can be made from sheep milk, goat milk, or a mixture of the two. It is a lovely cheese that is coated with ash and then dried herbs and aged. Originally made in Corsica, it is soft when young, then it becomes runny, and, eventually, quite firm. Brin d'Amour means \"sprig of love,\" and it is so named for its coating of herb sprigs.\nManchego is the most famous Spanish sheep milk cheese. It is a pressed cheese and quite firm. Its rind is ridged with the pattern of the mold in which the cheese is made and often shows traces of a green-black mold that grows on the cheese during aging. Idiaz\u00e1bal is a fabulous cheese from the Basque region of Spain. Traditionally, it is lightly smoked.\nThe dry, rocky terrain of Greece is well adapted to goats as well as sheep. Many cheeses there are made from sheep milk, as are the cheeses of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. Sheep milk was originally used to make Feta. (Its name comes from fetes, which means \"large block of cheese\" in Greek.) Today it is still made with sheep milk, but there is often a bit of goat milk mixed in because Greek shepherds usually have a few goats living in the midst of their herds. Others of the sheep milk cheeses that abound in Greece include Manouri, Mizithra, and Kasseri.\nThe popular blue-veined Roquefort and Cabrales are both sheep milk cheeses.\nMild, Bland, and Buttery Cheeses, or Table Cheeses\nTable cheeses are cheeses that are good for cooking as well as eating plain or in simple sandwiches. Cheeses that fall into this category have smooth, creamy textures and mild, pleasant flavors and aromas. Such cheeses as Monterey Jack and Caciottas fit into this group. Cheeses such as Edam, Gouda, and Havarti fall into this category when they are quite young, as do many others.\nFlavored cheeses\nFlavored cheeses can be found in all countries and in all cheese catagories. Flavorings range from pungent garlic or fiery chiles to the mildest of herbs. Cheeses can be coated with herbs, studded with nuts, or coated with grape seeds. The list is endless.\nIn France, Gaperon is a well-known flavored cheese. This soft cheese is very strongly flavored with garlic and peppercorns, coated with a bloomy rind, and hung to ripen. In olden times, Gaperon was hung from kitchen rafters to age, and the number hanging was an indication of a farmer's wealth.\nIn Denmark, Havarti is often flavored with herbs or caraway seeds. In Holland, some cheeses are flavored with cumin seeds. Italian Pecorino can be flavored with peppercorns. In France, Boursin is flavored with herbs and garlic or coated with black pepper, and fresh goat cheeses are often rolled in fresh or dried herbs. England's Derby Sage is flavored with sage. In Switzerland, Sapsago is flavored with herbs. Corsican Brin d'Amour is completely coated in herbs.\nLeaves also impart special flavors to the cheeses they wrap: Banon is wrapped in chestnut leaves, Cabrales in sycamore leaves. At the Mozzarella Company, we wrap goat cheese with hoja santa leaves, which impart a sassafras flavor.\nIn the United States, many cheeses are flavored, such as Pepper Jack, a Monterey Jack with hot chiles. At the Mozzarella Company, we flavor many of our Caciottas with herbs and chiles to regionalize them. Many cream cheeses are flavored with herbs and some with fruits and nuts.\nSmoked Cheeses also fall under the category of flavored cheeses. Most are hung and smoked with natural smoke; some, however, such as mozzarella, may merely be painted with liquid smoke.\nProcessed Cheeses\nProcessed cheeses are natural cheeses of varying types that are heated, pasteurized, and cooked together to blend them into a new cheese. Velveeta is a prime example. Processed cheeses are quite hardy, able to withstand long periods of time unrefrigerated.\nYou put your left index finger on your eye and your right index finger on the camembert...if they sort of feel the same, the cheese is ready.\nFresh Cream Cheese\nCream cheese is a simple cheese to make at home. The entire cheesemaking process will take at least three days, but not much of that involves actual work, and the finished product is well worth the effort. This fresh cream cheese won't look like store-bought cheese. It will be soft and appear a little curdled, but it smoothes out easily once it warms to room temperature and is stirred. It can be whipped using the food processor or a hand mixer, but be careful not to overprocess it because it can break down very quickly and become runny. Use it in cheesecakes, fruit tarts, or vegetable dips. Of course, it's great on bagels too.\nMakes almost 2 pounds, or 4 cups\n1 gallon homogenized whole milk\nOne 10-pound bag ice\n1 packet mesophilic cultures (see Note)\n4 drops vegetable rennet (see Note)\n1 to 2 teaspoons salt, or to taste\nPrepare a sanitizing solution of 1 quart water and 1 tablespoon household bleach.\nRinse a large stainless steel or enameled stockpot or soup pot with the sanitizing solution and pour the milk into the pot. Heat over medium heat, using a sanitized spoon to stir as necessary to keep the milk from scorching, until it reaches 165\u00a6F. While the milk is heating, fill the sink or a large bowl with the ice and a little water.\nOnce the milk has reached 165\u00a6F., remove the pot from the heat and place it in the ice bath. Stir occasionally until it cools to 90\u00a6F.; this should take about 20 minutes. Transfer the milk to a sanitized bowl. Add the mesophilic cultures to the milk (the instructions on the package say that one packet inoculates 2 gallons milk, but you should use the whole packet for this recipe) and stir well for 1 minute. Cover with plastic wrap and then with a dish towel. Set aside, undisturbed, in a warm place (70\u00a6 to 80\u00a6F.) for 45 minutes; an unheated oven is a good place.\nDilute the rennet in 1/2 cup cold water, stirring well. Add this to the inoculated milk and stir in a figure-eight pattern for 2 minutes. (The rennet is very concentrated, so the dilution and stirring are critical.) Cover the container with clean plastic wrap and then with a dish towel and set aside, undisturbed, in a warm place (70\u00a6 to 80\u00a6F.) until the whey (clear yellow liquid) appears on top and the curd is firm enough for you to press gently on it without breaking it. This should take between 18 and 28 hours: When the milk is properly coagulated, the curd will resemble white gelatin or yogurt and be firm enough to hold its shape on a spoon. (If this doesn't happen within the given time range, the room temperature may be too cool or the cultures may be slow in their acid development; just wait a few more hours and test the curd for coagulation again.) To test the curd, wash your hands and dip them into the sanitizing solution. Dip your forefinger into the coagulated milk and slowly raise it to the surface, with your finger extended horizontally. The curd should rise up slightly and then there will be a clean breaking line in the curd if the milk is properly coagulated.\nRinse a colander and a large piece of muslin or several layers of cheesecloth in the sanitizing solution. Wring out the cloth to release the excess water. Line the colander with the cloth and set the colander in the sink or over a large bowl. (If you want to save the high-protein whey for cooking or baking, set the colander over the bowl.)\nOnce the curd has coagulated, use a sanitized ladle or a mesh skimmer to carefully scoop the curd into the colander. When transferring the curd, be careful to break it up as little as possible. If the curd is shattered, it will expel more whey and that will make the cheese drier and less flavorful. Fold the excess fabric over the curd and set the colander in a large bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for 24 hours to drain and chill.\nTransfer the cheese to a sanitized bowl, stir it with a spoon, and add salt to taste. Cover tightly and refrigerate; use within 1 week.\nNote: The cultures and rennet are available from the New England Cheesemaking Supply Company.\nAsiago-Stuffed Veal Roll\nIn Italy, meat rolls with fillings are quite popular. They are not difficult to make. All you do is pound veal scaloppine thin, arrange it to form a large sheet, spread on the filling, and then roll it up and tie it. All the work is done ahead of time so that you are free while it's merrily cooking away in the oven.\nThis one, with roasted garlic, spinach, and Asiago, can be served either warm or at room temperature.\nServes 6\n1 bunch spinach, stems removed and washed (about 12 ounces)\n10 cloves garlic, unpeeled\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n2 pounds veal scaloppine\n1 1/2 teaspoons Seasoning Salt (page 79) or salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs\n1 ounce Asiago, grated (1/4 cup)\n3 tablespoons drained capers\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper or to taste\nKitchen string\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\n3 cups Paula's Tomato Sauce (page 84) or store-bought\n6 sprigs fresh basil, for garnish\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.\nPlace the spinach in a large skillet, add 1 tablespoon water, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and steam for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, remove the cover, and set aside to cool.\nPlace the garlic in a small ovenproof dish and drizzle with the olive oil. Cover with aluminum foil. Place in the oven and roast for 20 minutes, or until soft. Remove from oven, uncover, and set aside to cool. Leave the oven on.\nLay a sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface, place a piece of veal on the plastic, and cover with another sheet of plastic wrap. With a meat pounder or other flat utensil, pound to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Repeat with the remaining pieces.\nArrange the scallopine on a clean sheet of plastic wrap, with the grain all going the same way, slightly overlapping each other so that they form a rectangle of about 16 x 12 inches, with a long side facing you. Sprinkle the meat with 1/2 teaspoon of the seasoning salt. Spread the spinach leaves out flat on top of the meat, completely covering it. Top the spinach with the bread crumbs and Asiago, distributing them evenly. Sprinkle the capers, oregano, and pepper on top.\nRemove the garlic from the oil and squeeze it out of its skin. Smash and flatten with the flat side of a knife. Distribute on top of the veal. Roll up the meat fairly tightly, starting with the long bottom edge, to enclose all of the stuffing. Push anything that pops out back into the roll, and do not worry about any small separations on the inside. Place the roll on a cutting board and cut in half crosswise using a sharp knife, so that you have 2 rolls about 8 x 3 inches. Tie each roll with kitchen string, wrapping the string around the roll at 1-inch intervals, and then tie lengthwise to contain the filling. Rub the veal with the remaining 1 teaspoon seasoning salt. (The meat can be prepared to this point and refrigerated for up to 24 hours; increase the cooking time by 15 minutes.)\nHeat the olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the veal rolls and sear on all sides, turning as necessary using tongs. Place the veal in a baking dish about 13 x 9 inches. Pour the tomato sauce over and around the veal.\nPlace it in the oven and roast for 45 minutes, or until the meat is golden brown and registers 155\u00b0F. on a meat thermometer. Remove from the oven, snip and remove the string, and set aside, loosely covered with foil, for 15 minutes. Serve warm.\nTo serve, slice the rolls into 1-inch slices. Place 2 slices on each heated serving plate and spoon sauce over the edges of the slices. Garnish with the basil. Pass the remaining sauce.\nCannoli Filled with Pistachio Ricotta\nWhile they are now available all over Italy, cannoli are traditionally a Sicilian dessert in which ricotta is mixed with candied fruits, nuts, or chocolate to fill crispy pastry shells. Cannoli shells are easy to make yourself, but they can also be found in Italian grocery stores or gourmet shops, in both regular and mini sizes.\nBecause Sicily is an island in the middle of the Mediterranean, over the ages many different people colonized it. You'll find Greek, Arab, Roman, and even Norman influences. So while toasted pistachio nuts and dried cranberries may not be a traditional cannoli filling, they still have a Sicilian feel. Not to mention an Italian color scheme -- green, white, and red.\nIf you are game, you can easily make cannoli shells using egg roll wrappers. The hard part will be finding something to use as a mold. I use aluminum tubing that was cut to the proper length at a hardware store, but some specialty gourmet shops do carry cannoli molds.\nMakes 8 large or 12 mini cannoli\nServes 4 to 6\n1/4 cup dried cranberries or dried cherries, chopped\n2 tablespoons amaretto liqueur\n8 ounces ricotta, homemade (page 70) or store-bought, well drained (1 cup)\n1/4 cup sugar\n2 ounces (1/4 cup) mascarpone, homemade (page 73) or store-bought, cold\n1/4 cup toasted pistachio nuts, chopped\n8 large or 12 mini cannoli shells, homemade (recipe follows) or store-bought\n1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, for garnish\nSoak the dried cranberries in the amaretto in a small bowl for 30 minutes.\nCombine the ricotta and sugar in a small bowl and whip until smooth. Add the mascarpone and stir to incorporate. Be careful not to overmix, or the mascarpone might separate. Fold in the pistachios and dried cranberries with their soaking liquid.\nTransfer to a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip and pipe the mixture into the cannoli shells. If you don't have a pastry bag, put the filling into a plastic bag, snip off one corner, and squeeze the filling out into the pastry shells. (Do this close to serving time so the shells won't lose their crispness.) Refrigerate until serving time.\nTo serve, dust with confectioners' sugar, using a sieve. Serve chilled.\nCanolli Shells\n12 egg roll wrappers\n1 cup vegetable oil\nCut the egg roll wrappers into circles 4 inches in diameter. Roll the wrappers around molds or pieces of aluminum tubing that are 1 inch in diameter and 4 1/2 to 5 inches in length. Moisten the overlapped flap of dough with water to seal each wrapper.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet until hot but not smoking, about 350\u00b0F. Add the shells, still on the tubing, and fry, turning with tongs as necessary, until golden brown and crispy on all sides. Remove immediately, using tongs, and stand the tubing on end on paper towels to drain. When cool, slip the cannoli shells off the tubing.\nVariation\nCassata\nServes 8\nRather than using the cannoli shells, slice a 2-pound pound cake, about 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 inches, into 3 horizontal layers. Place the cake layers on a flat surface. Drizzle each layer with amaretto liqueur. Spread the ricotta filling on all the layers and reassemble the cake. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. To serve, garnish the top of the cake with the dried cranberries and toasted pistachios pressed down into the ricotta. Cut the cake into 1-inch slices. Serve chilled.\nCopyright \u00a9 2000 by Paula Lambert\n--From The Cheese Lover's Cookbook and Guide : Over 150 Recipes With Instruction on How to Buy, Store, and Serve All Your Favorite Cheeses, by Paula Lambert. \u00a9 November 2000, Simon & Schuster used by permission.\nFind Items On Similar Subjects\nAll prices subject to change and given in U.S. Dollars.\nCopyright \u00a91998-2007 WINE COUNTRY TRAVEL All Rights Reserved\nAll materials contained in http://www.WineCountryTravel.com are protected by copyright and trademark laws and may not be used for any purpose whatsoever other than private, non-commercial viewing purposes.

However, there are multiple ways of mitigating the risk.\nDo we deal with it by trading our freedoms for a top-down, big-government approach? This is far from perfect; witness the massively expensive recalls of processed food all the time. The disgraceful thing about that is how much good food is wasted each time. Centralization usually brings extra waste.\nOr do you mitigate the risk on a less centralized level, where those who take the risks more seriously have the wherewithal to take extra care during food processing. Either way, the universe is messy. We can't eliminate risk, we can just shove it under the rug or make it someone else's responsibility so we can get on with our shopping, vacationing, and commuting.\nJuly 28, 2010 at 4:40 pm |\ncommon sense\nI agree freedom of choice.

All the milk had to be boiled and made into cheese, occasionally a little went into hot chocolate. Sick dairy regions like that do not exist in the US because of health laws that seemed draconian at the time they were first implemented.\nIn the 18th and earlier century it was common for children to die of TB, often in terrible forms like bone TB, from milk. All that is gone in the US now because of health laws like this. If we sell dangerous milk to some adult in line with their 'freedom' to endanger themselves, how can we be sure that some the adults buying this stuff are not feeding it to infants, children and the incapacitated elderly or to immune compromised. Public health regulation has done more to extend our lifespans than has medicine. Pasteurization does not hurt milk. It is true that goat milk is better than cow milk for infants and adults, but pasteurization will not hurt it. 'Your' children belong to themselves, not to you; you cannot make dangerous choices for them.\nJuly 27, 2010 at 9:35 pm |\nFrank\nAnother freedom lost.

Therefore, following that line of argument, that since we have been doing that for thousands of years \u2013 that justifies the existence of George Warcrime Bush, Osama been laiden, Kim ill junk, Mad off, Ahmad dinnerjet, etc.\nOn the other hand, we are humans. A maturing humanity should seek to make responsible decisions independent of Gd or Evolution. Just as you want your children make their own responsible decisions. If Gd or Evolution has to micromanage our decision processes to ensure we did it right, then Gd has failed in His act of creation.\nWhen will we stop using Gd, satan or Evolution as an excuse to do things? Gd created us with Evolution as His right hand and put satan in charge as the quality control manager. The rest is up to us. If we think that going to war, killing unborn babies and increasing the CO2 levels will help propagate the human race and preserve our stewardship of the Universe so be it.

The consuption of raw milk commonly caused serious illness and deaths before pasturization became wide-spread. That is why a process for making milk safer was first sought out and developed. Unfortunately, it was young children who suffered the most from this. We don't see as many cases now since most people drink pasturized milk products. If the entire population went to unpasturized milk, you would see the instances of milk-related illness sky-rocket.\nThe argument that raw milk is perfectly safe mirrors that of people against vaccination for childhood disease. Before vaccinations were widespread, children suffered high mortality rates to diseases that are rarely seen today. Once vaccinations became the norm, those diseases were almost wiped out. Since parents rarely see those illnesses, they assume vaccinations are no longer necessary. They don't bother to research enough to discover that vaccinations give a high resistance to the population, but not complete immunity. If enough unvaccinated children start coming down with these diseases, it is possible to spread them to others who have been vaccinated. They are, in affect, endangering other people and the general population in general when they refuse to vaccinate their children. Some people will attack me for stating the truth, but do a little research. Illnesses that were once almost extinct are beginning to make a come-back, especially in urban areas.\nIf you choose to consume raw milk products, at least recognize the risks involved. It is no different than consuming raw eggs or undercooked meat. The likelihood of becoming ill may be low, but it does exist. As for claims that raw milk cures a plethora of illness, I've seen no rigorous scientific studies that prove this. If you have access to such information, please link it. I'd be interested in reading it.\nJuly 27, 2010 at 1:08 pm |\nMoodyMoody\nExactly! I believe that the government should allow the sale of raw milk and raw milk products, provided that there is a warning label to the effect of \"unpasteurized milk has been proven to carry fatal disease, especially in young children.\" They should also be required to print the symptoms of the most common milk-carried diseases on the label, such as high fever, vomiting, etc. Also make them print that benefits of raw versus pasteurized milk are unproven. That's a reasonable compromise, in my opinion. If people want to be stupid, let them; don't let them be totally ignorant.\nJuly 27, 2010 at 3:52 pm |\nDrRonPaul2012\nDr Ron Paul, a doctor, has confirmed that there is no health reason that justifies government intrusion in milk production. He's a doctor, MD.\nJuly 27, 2010 at 12:28 pm |\nPirogi\nCharlene \u2013 you are exactly right. But they aren't stopping with raiding dairy farms or arresting Amish farmers. \"They\" (Big Dairy and Big Agri-biz, working through the USDA) have been trying to push a national animal identifcation system (NAIS) on us since 2004. Their cover story was an animal disease tracking system, but the real reason was to increase Agri-biz's foreign export market. Even the reducing-the-spread-of-disease reason crumbles when you look at the diseases involved, the timetable for disease identification in animal products, and the fact that there are already regulations in place for meat to be inspected at slaughter and processing (not that this is always enforeced correctly, but that is another issue to do with the USDA). One of the many practical implications of this program is that small homesteaders and farmers would have to register their premises and all of their animals with the government, fill out paperwork for every new animal birth or death, every animal that jumps a fence, every time they have a predator problem. They would also have to pay annual fees associated with the program. It would be quite easy to drive small homesteaders and farmers out of business with this regulation.\nFortunately, NAIS had funding cut by Congress this month. Unfortunately, the effort is not dead, with Tennessee rallying already for the same program under a new name \u2013 the Animal Disease Traceability Program.\nGovernment is in the pocket of Big Dairy and Big Agri-biz. The little guys fight, and fight, and then fight again. Maybe we will succeed in maintaining a real food supply.\nJuly 27, 2010 at 11:20 am |\nKirkpatrick\nOh yeah?

It's totally normal to drink the milk from cow/s you raised or your neighbor raised and drink it. The US has just trashed local dairy farms by creating the industrial dairy farm industry and made it seem like the milk being produced by overworked, hormone-fed cows was the \"safe\" milk to drink. As Jason commented above, pasturization has been used to ensure that people can still drink milk from cows who are fed, drugged, and milked in unhealthy production environments. I choose to drink raw milk because of the increased nutrition and incomparable flavor of the milk \u2013 it's a FOOD this way! But I also choose to drink raw milk because of the relationship I have directly with the farmer who takes good care of his cows and cares about the milk products that they produce.\nJuly 27, 2010 at 10:06 am |\nCorey\nI think it should be a personal choice whether or not to consume it. I lived in France and enjoyed all the raw cheeses and would by raw milk here in Colorado if I were staying. The fact that the police went in with guns drawn is absurd. From what I can tell in the story they are just operating the same way as the raw milk farms here. You buy a portion and have access to the amount of the animal or land you have purchased.\nOn a second note, If you are getting got sick off a vegan diet you did not do enough research to change your diet and take necessary actions for what you would like if you were consuming animal based products.\nAlso I have issues with people saying they are vegan when they are not.\nVeganism as defined by the Vegan Society:\n\"The word \"veganism\" denotes a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude \u2014 as far as is possible and practical \u2014 all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment.

For a week, I had no symptoms I usually had and I didn't have a single headache that I usually get on a regular basis, like 2-3 times a week. I am a believer in it! Goat's milk of course doesn't have lactose at all. Lactose is the sugar in cow's milk. So that makes sense, but if you drink raw cow's milk, I would assume the bacteria and enzymes needed to properly digest it would be in it which is killed off during the pasteurization process. I haven't researched that but it would make sense. Any thoughts on that?\nJuly 26, 2010 at 1:33 pm |\nWill\nAlso, I believe we only pasteurize our milk so we can transport it 1000's of miles and last a week after that and still be safe. It isn't just to keep people from getting sick. All of these farmers drink it fresh and they don't have problems. I purchased some and it lasted about a week. It had not funny smell after a week either like the supermarket milk does.\nJuly 26, 2010 at 1:36 pm |\nJason\nThe poll and the article miss the point. It's not about whether raw dairy is or is not safe, it's about where and when the dairy was produced and whether it's trustworthy by the time it's consumed. I would not consume raw dairy (or any other perishable food) without knowing its history. That rules out highly processed foods that have been through an untraceable web of treatments, storage, and transportation.\nPasteurization doesn't make an inherently unsafe product safe. What it does is make it possible to produce, process and distribute dairy in ways that otherwise would surely have made it unsafe.\nAnd therein lies the solution for these activists: do more of your own production, closer to home.\nJuly 26, 2010 at 1:20 pm |\nWill\nJuly 26, 2010 at 1:37 pm |\nCharlene\nHere Here! thanks for the succinct reply!\nJuly 27, 2010 at 9:59 am |\nchris\nNo other animal willingly drinks another animal's milk unless it's life depends on it, like in starvation cases.

It is how our brains evolved into what they are today. In fact vegans and vegetarians are both highly susceptible to B12 deficiencies, a vitamin that naturally occurs in meat/ animal products and is critical to normal brain metabolism. Without it we risk hormonal imbalances, nerve degeneration and dementia.\nHowever, our over-consumption of animal products has brought significant harm to humanity: heart disease, food borne illnesses, over population, obesity, animal cruelty in farms and an extensive evironmental impact.\nThe answer lies with consuming small portions of meat/dairy occasionally rather than with every meal as our ancestors did. This would reduce the number of animals being slaughtered or used for milk, enabling us to return to smaller cruelty-free farms as well as clear up most of the health issues for humans. As always, the rule is everything in moderation.\nJuly 26, 2010 at 3:20 pm |\nJesse\nThank you for a sane balanced view.\nJuly 27, 2010 at 1:31 pm |\nLiz\nNutritional yeast or good vitamins make up for the B12 issue.\nJuly 27, 2010 at 5:32 pm |\nSusan\nI don't know how you can consider raw milk any big deal. It was what I was raised on \u2013 come on, just be clean and you are perfectly fine like anything else. You don't see us pasteurizing the jalapenos or alfalfa sprouts that have caused huge e-coli outbreaks, huh? I now have my own source of milk right outside my door. I drink it raw simply because it's easier and boiling milk in my house stinks (gross)! The health food nuts and the crazy government oversight are equally silly. Where I live you can sell raw milk off your farm, presumably because people can go and see exactly where it is coming from, whether you are clean, and make their own judgment. How many of you folks go to a dairy or milk processor and see all the chemicals and grossness they dump into it? Because with the feedlot those cows are living on, they have to dump chemicals on to sanitize the poop out of it. People are so silly on all sides of this issue, raw milk people come of as crazed health nuts, too. I wish people would just relax and let others do what they choose when it comes to this.\nJuly 26, 2010 at 11:07 am |\nPirogi\nWe drink raw milk from our dairy goats every day (as did generations of humans before us). Unfortunately, that is the only way in many states to legally get raw dairy, and most people don't live in areas where it is possible or don't have enough time to devote to livestock dairy animals. I fully support providing pasteurized milk products for those who desire that, but if a person actively seeks out raw milk to purchase and consume, what basis does the government have to prevent that? Do I still have the right to refuse western medical treatment? To enjoy my steak a little bloody? To consume raw fish and shellfish? To not wear sunscreen? What is different with choosing to consume raw milk?\nJuly 26, 2010 at 11:00 am |\nSusan\nI agree, and I also have dairy goats and was raised on raw milk. What is really sad though, is I live in Minnesota where we have had some E-Coli from the cow people. Even though we can sell it off the farm, I have had the raw goat activists contact me and say I should not be doing that because they don't want me to \"wreck it for everyone.\" I had to laugh. If anything, my state will succumb to the hype and completely outlaw raw milk sales. And the ones who are policing are the very people who are supposedly in favor of it who, by the way, come off as a bunch of crackpots to the general public, claiming cancer cures, etc. I do think the government will win on this one and raw milk consumption will go out the window.\nJuly 26, 2010 at 11:11 am |\nVeganGirl\nRaw or not, cow/goat/etc milk is just not meant for human consumption anyway.

There are many experts (not paid for by dairy lobbyists) who believe that consuming milk as an adult actually creates problems in your body. For many people their stomachs get bloated/inflamed by milk \u2013 without ever really connecting the dots. There are not any nutritional benefits from milk consumption \u2013 despite what the milk lobbyists try to explaim regarding vitamin d. You cant possibly get the amount of Vitamin D you need from milk, its not even remotely possible...and also, most people in northern climates are severly deficient in Vitamin D (which can cause a whole host of health issues). Anywho, there's a reason the dairy lobby wants to promote this product as essential to your diet \u2013 their business would disappear if they didnt do that. Im not saying do not consume ANY dairy, what I am saying is, restrict the amount you consume. Your body will thank you.\nJuly 27, 2010 at 9:31 am |\nJesse\nYou are absolutely correct there are no studies showing any nutrient value to milk, I mena it totally lacks protein and has never been suggested for people with or prone to gout.\nJuly 27, 2010 at 1:19 pm |\nCarol\nRight, and doctors never recommnended drinking milk to help maintan bone density. (that's sacrasm)\nJuly 27, 2010 at 2:04 pm |\nColorado Girl\nYou make a point about milk causing bloating and indigestion. That is because a LARGE fraction of society is \"lactose-intolerant\". Pretty much every human being can consume milk up to four years of age (in some cultures, children aren't weaned until four, though obviously that's rare these days). Past that, though...people descended from Southern Europe, most of Asia, and parts of Africa are highly disposed to lactose intolerance...their bodies just stop processing lactose. Rates of lactose intolerance are much lower particularly among people of Northern European descent.\nThat doesn't mean milk is bad for you, or dairy even. The entire issue with pasturization is that it takes meticulous, careful farming to produce raw milk and dairy products without bacterial contamination, but pasturization greatly decreases the nutrient content in milk. The 2second pasturization at the highest temperature removes the majority of nutrients, which is why you run into \"nutrient-added\" milk brands like SmartBalance advertising less fat and more protein. Milkfat is not problematic when ingested along with all the natural nutrients in milk, and raw milk has protein levels shockingly higher than brand milk found in stores.\nThe health risks and consequent regulations make sense, but the people getting sick clearly aren't doing their homework, because responsible farmers will not sell their products if they are contaminated. Raw dairy is definitely a complicated issue. The bigger issue is that the \"milk industry\" wants money, yes... the milk sold in store HAS few health benefits...so basically, you're right: milk has a negligible impact on your diet unless it is raw or GENTLY pasturized.\nAs for those people who are lactose-intolerant, they can still reap the benefits of dairy from some kinds of cheese. The chemical process involved in turning milk to cheese greatly reduces lactose levels.\nAs for the vegan argument above- yes, you can get a proper balanced diet if you pay close attention. But if you are only focused on avoiding animal products and not on the nutrients going into your body, you WILL get very sick, because you will be malnourished. That said, a vegan diet supports unsustainable farming, which throws a teensy wrench into the ethics behind that diet.\nJuly 27, 2010 at 6:16 pm |\nArtemis\nDrinking cow's milk is not \"natural\" for humans. Yes, we domesticated the cow long ago and have been consuming milk and milk products, but that does not mean it is natural for us to do so. I've read several articles that outlined how milk is actually not tolerated by a large portion of the world's population who, as adults, do not have the necessary enzymes in their bodies to properly break down the protein. I personally discovered through an observant doctor that I am allergic to dairy products: not \"intolerant,\" meaning my body cannot process it, but actually allergic, where my hands, feet and face swell up and I will choke and gag from the fluid in my throat (I'd felt like this for years, but all the other doctors I'd seen assumed it was just becasue I was overweight at the time and never bothered to check for anything else).\nJuly 28, 2010 at 8:16 pm |\nSteve\nMy family originally were Iowa farmers.

All \"organic\" means is that the farm the milk comes from does not use antibiotics to fight infections in cows or hormones to stimulate more milk production .\nOrganic milk lasts longer because producers use a different process to preserve it. According to the Northeast Organic Dairy Producers Alliance, the milk needs to stay fresh longer because organic products often have to travel farther to reach store shelves since it is not produced throughout the country.\nThe process that gives the milk a longer shelf life is called ultrahigh temperature (UHT) processing or treatment, in which milk is heated to 280 degrees Fahrenheit (138 degrees Celsius) for two to four seconds, killing any bacteria in it.\nCompare that to pasteurization, the standard preservation process. There are two types of pasteurization: \"low temperature, long time,\" in which milk is heated to 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for at least 30 minutes*, or the more common \"high temperature, short time,\" in which milk is heated to roughly 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) for at least 15 seconds.\nThe different temperatures hint at why UHT-treated milk lasts longer: Pasteurization doesn\u2019t kill all bacteria in the milk, just enough so that you don't get a disease with your milk mustache. UHT, on the other hand, kills everything.\nRetailers typically give pasteurized milk an expiration date of four to six days. Ahead of that, however, was up to six days of processing and shipping, so total shelf life after pasteurization is probably up to two weeks. Milk that undergoes UHT doesn\u2019t need to be refrigerated and can sit on the shelf for up to six months.\nRegular milk can undergo UHT, too. The process is used for the room-temperature Parmalat milk found outside the refrigerator case and for most milk sold in Europe.\nSo why isn\u2019t all milk produced using UHT?\nOne reason is that UHT-treated milk tastes different. UHT sweetens the flavor of milk by burning some of its sugars (caramelization). A lot of Americans find this offensive\u2014just as they are leery of buying nonrefrigerated milk. Europeans, however, don\u2019t seem to mind.\nUHT also destroys some of the milk\u2019s vitamin content\u2014not a significant amount\u2014and affects some proteins, making it unusable for cheese .\nThere are, of course, lots of reasons people buy organic milk. But if it's the long shelf life you're after, I would recommend you buy nonorganic UHT milk and avoid being charged double.\n*Correction (6/6/08): This sentence originally said \"milk is heated to 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for at least 30 seconds.\" (The error occurred during editing by the staff of ScientificAmerican.com and is not the fault of\u00a0 the expert.)\n"}, {"score": 967.3393, "uuid": "ca051a25-6a7e-591b-86fa-fc1dd1e0ff9f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1804wb-12-04428", "target_hostname": "www.greenmamaspad.com", "target_uri": "http://www.greenmamaspad.com/2011/07/my-first-taste-of-raw-milk.html", "page_rank": 1.2121555e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "My First <em>Taste</em> of Raw Milk | Marianna | Connecticut Mom Blog", "snippet": "It <em>does</em> carry a hefty price-tag, but it is so much <em>better</em> for them and <em>tastes</em> a world (in my opinion) <em>better</em>!

What is raw milk? Raw milk is full fat milk that is not pasteurized and not homogenized. This is still pretty new to me so I am not going to go into the whole debate of pasteurized versus unpasteurized milk, but from what I had learned, raw milk is said to have many health benefits that you don't get from pasteurized milk. I have also seen other mom's say that their non-milk drinking kids would drink raw milk, and that is what prompted me to buy some this weekend.\nMy 18 month old doesn't like milk. I am actually not all that concerned about it. One of our 4 year old twins doesn't drink milk either. I just make sure he gets enough calcium from yogurt, cheese and supplements. However, I at least wanted to give all options a try this time around. So when I was in my local natural food store this weekend and I saw the raw milk in the refrigerator case, I decided to give it a try. Despite the $5.69 prie tag for half a gallon. Ouch.\nThis milk is from Stone Wall Dairy Farm in Cornwall Bridge, CT and is sold in various stores around the state. I should mention that I feel lucky that Connecticut is a state where the retail sale of raw milk is legal. There are many states where it is only legal to be sold at farms and then even some states where it is flat out illegal to sell raw milk. Seems pretty ridiculous to me but whatever.\nSo I came home with my half gallon of raw milk anxious to give my baby boy a sip. I noticed that the fat separates to the top, so I gave it a good shake and poured a little into a straw cup for him. Yeah, he didn't like it. After he took a small sip, he shook his head and handed the cup back to me. We tried again later but with the same result. This was also his same reaction to commercial milk. So, operation raw milk was a fail in that respect. Such a bummer for me. Though I do plan to keep trying while I have it in the house.\nNow here I am, left with pretty much a full half gallon of raw milk and not sure what the heck to do with it. For some reason, I was so hesitant to try it myself. Is it wrong that I made my toddler taste it before I did? I think most moms probably taste something themselves before handing it over to their child. Nope, not me. I just put the container back in the fridge while I built up the courage to taste it.\nMany hours later, I poured some into a glass for myself and drank it. You know what it tasted like? Milk. After reading how much better raw milk tastes I just envisioned that raw milk was going to be completely different and that is why I was nervous. I did not want it to be gross and then I really just through nearly $6 in the trash. So I was pleasantly surprised when I found that it tastes like commercial milk. I mean it is slightly different I suppose, but not that much. At least not for me.\nHave you ever given raw milk a try? Did you love it?

Many alternative practitioners feel that it's not necessary for humans to consume cow's milk and link its consumption to health problems, such as ear infections, allergies, cancer and diabetes. On the other hand, the medical community has convinced us that if we don't drink enough milk our bones will disintegrate. And the American Dairy Association wants us to think we'll be cool like celebrities with milk mustaches if we drink lots of milk.\nThe purpose of this article is not to convince you to drink milk or not to drink milk. Instead, it addresses those who do--or would like to--drink milk and consume dairy products. If you fit into this category, then you need to know where your milk has come from and what it has been through.\nLiving Conditions\nIf I were to ask you to picture a cow, you would most likely see in your mind a cow grazing in an open pasture, like one you'd probably seen before on a small family farm. That's a lucky cow, compared to most of the cows bred for dairy production in this country. The majority of commercial dairy cows don't have the luxury of grazing on open fields. Instead they are kept in intense confinement, in individual stalls, on hard cement floors, hooked up to milking machines, forced to produce milk ten months out of the year, in an overcrowded building. This is how the average commercial dairy cow spends her short, miserable life--42 months on average, compared to 12-15 years for a cow on pasture.\nEnvironment\nNot only is the unnatural building environment a problem for the cow, but it can be a huge problem for the people around it as well. The massive amount of waste produced on a factory farm is overwhelming and can have devastating effects on the surrounding environment. Over one-fifth of the country's dairy products are produced in the central valley of California where confinement operations create as much waste as a city of 21 million people! Much of that waste is forced unnaturally into the environment, polluting our lakes, rivers and streams. On the other hand, small farms are able to recycle manure back into the earth to enrich the soil.\nFeed\nA cow's natural diet consists mostly of grass, but since there isn't enough grass to go around on the factory farm, today's factory cow is fed a diet of mostly grain, and other things that they would not normally eat. The bulk of the feed consists of corn and soy, which receives 80 percent of all herbicides used in the US. When we think of pesticides we usually think of produce, but animal products can contain up to 14 times more pesticides than plants!1\nSimply switching the cow's diet from grass to grain can cause many problems, but that's only the beginning. According to a recent article in US News & World Report, some 40 billion pounds a year of slaughterhouse wastes like blood, bone and viscera, as well as the remains of millions of euthanized cats and dogs passed along by veterinarians and animal shelters, are rendered annually into livestock feed.\nAnimal-feed manufacturers and farmers also have begun using or trying out dehydrated food garbage, fats emptied from restaurant fryers and grease traps, cement-kiln dust, even newspapers and cardboard that are derived from plant cellulose. Researchers in addition have experimented with cattle and hog manure, and human sewage sludge.\"2\nWhen I first read this I thought there were probably only a handful of farmers crazy enough to feed dead cats and dogs and other animals parts to their vegetarian cows, but I was dead wrong! During the BSE scare, the FDA ordered a halt to feeding all slaughterhouse wastes to cattle and sheep in the US. At that time 75 percent of the nation's 90 million cattle had been eating feed containing slaughterhouse by-products!\nLike humans, animals need nutrients to thrive and be healthy. Obviously the feed given to factory farmed cows is not intended to provide proper nourishment. Instead, farmers, or shall I say food manufacturers, are interested in stuffing whatever they can into the cows to bulk them up as quickly as possible. This can quickly lead to sick animals and heavy doses of drugs. Like pesticides, these drugs end up in the milk of the dairy animals, as do trans fats from bakery wastes, undigested proteins from soy and animal foods and aflatoxins from moldy grain. To make matters worse, levels of vitamin A and D drop off precipitously when cows are given any feed other than green growing grass.\nAntibiotics\nIf you're like a growing number of people today, you would rather not take antibiotics when you get sick. You may even be proud of the fact that you haven't had to use them in years. However, if you drink commercial milk or eat commercially raised meats and poultry, you could be consuming antibiotics on a daily basis without even knowing it! Over 50 percent of all the antibiotics produced in this country are mixed directly into animal feed. Ideally, antibiotics should be used in farming only when necessary to treat infection. However, due to the sickly nature of factory farmed animals, they are fed a constant supply of antibiotics from birth until the time of slaughter.\nAntibiotic resistance is a serious issue that has gotten a lot of press in recent years. Basically, bacteria are mutating and outsmarting the antibiotics, making them ineffective. (The same phenomenon is occurring on farms where bugs are mutating to withstand pesticide applications.) We criticize medical doctors for over-prescribing antibiotics, but that is only part of the problem. Not only are antibiotics overused in this country, but they are also over-consumed. People are unknowingly consuming more antibiotics than they are actually taking by choice. Due to the heavy doses of antibiotics used on factory farmed animals, your steaks, hamburgers, chicken, and hotdogs are all laced with antibiotics. Milk alone contains traces of up to 80 different antibiotics!3\nHormones\nCAPTION: A typical modern dairy cow. Her udder is so full it almost drags on the ground and she must be milked three times per day. Note the unusual growth in front of her forelegs--a goiter or a tumor?\nBack in 1930, the average dairy cow produced 12 pounds (about a gallon and a half) of milk per day. In 1988, the average was 39 pounds per day. This was accomplished by selective breeding to obtain dairy cows that produced a lot of pituitary hormones, thereby generating large amounts of milk. But the industry was not satisfied with this output. Today rBGH, a synthetic growth hormone, is used to get even more milk out of the dairy cows, bringing the average up to 50 pounds (over 6 gallons) of milk per day.\nThis sounds like a great thing for dairy farmers, right? However, when you mess with Mother Nature, you will suffer the consequences. FDA documents show that cows injected with rBGH are 79 percent more likely to contract mastitis.4 In 1991, a report on Monsanto's BGH test herd at the University of Vermont found the same kinds of problems identified by the FDA, plus an alarming number of dead and deformed calves born to cows treated with BGH.5 Other problems include reproductive difficulties, increased need for antibiotics, digestive problems, enlarged hocks and lesions, and foot problems.\nAccording to the Humane Farming Association, The FDA admits that BGH injections increase sickness and drug use in dairy cows. Consumer's Union reports that because of increased udder infections, it is more likely that milk from treated cows will be of lower quality--containing more pus and bacteria--than milk from untreated cows.\"6\nPasteurization\nPasteurization is a process of heat treating milk to kill bacteria. Although Louis Pasteur developed this technique for preserving beer and wine, he was not responsible for applying it to milk. That was done at the end of the 1800s as a temporary solution until filthy urban dairies could find a way to produce cleaner milk. But instead of cleaning up milk production, dairies used pasteurization as a way to cover up dirty milk. As milk became more mass produced, pasteurization became necessary for large dairies to increase their profits. So the public then had to be convinced that pasteurized milk was safer than raw milk. Soon raw milk consumption was blamed for all sorts of diseases and outbreaks until the public was finally convinced that pasteurized milk was superior to milk in its natural state.\nToday if you mention raw milk, many people gasp and utter ridiculous statements like, \"You can die from drinking raw milk!\" But the truth is that there are far more risks from drinking pasteurized milk than unpasteurized milk. Raw milk naturally contains healthy bacteria that inhibit the growth of undesirable and dangerous organisms. Without these friendly bacteria, pasteurized milk is more susceptible to contamination. Furthermore, modern equipment, such as milking machines, stainless steel tanks and refrigerated trucks, make it entirely possible to bring clean, raw milk to the market anywhere in the US.\nNot only does pasteurization kill the friendly bacteria, it also greatly diminishes the nutrient content of the milk. Pasteurized milk has up to a 66 percent loss of vitamins A, D and E. Vitamin C loss usually exceeds 50 percent. Heat affects water soluble vitamins and can make them 38 percent to 80 percent less effective. Vitamins B6 and B12 are completely destroyed during pasteurization. Pasteurization also destroys beneficial enzymes, antibodies and hormones. Pasteurization destroys lipase (an enzyme that breaks down fat), which impairs fat metabolism and the ability to properly absorb fat soluble vitamins A and D. (The dairy industry is aware of the diminished vitamin D content in commercial milk, so they fortify it with a form of this vitamin.)\nWe have all been led to believe that milk is a wonderful source of calcium, when in fact, pasteurization makes calcium and other minerals less available. Complete destruction of phosphatase is one method of testing to see if milk has been adequately pasteurized. Phosphatase is essential for the absorption of calcium.\nUltrapasteurization\nAs the dairy industry has become more concentrated, many processing plants have switched to ultrapasteurization, which involves higher temperatures and longer treatment times. The industry says this is necessary because many microorganisms have become heat resistant and now survive ordinary pasteurization.\nAnother reason for ultrapasteurization is that it gives the milk a longer shelf life--up to four weeks. The grocers like this but many consumers complain of a burnt or dead taste. The milk is virtually sterile--is that what you want to drink?\nMilk producers are not advertising the fact that they are ultrapasteurizing the milk--the word is written in very small letters and the milk is sold in the refrigerator section even though it can be kept unrefrigerated until opened. Horizon, the major organic brand, is ultrapasteurized, as are virtually all national brands.\nHomogenization\nMilk straight from the cow contains cream, which rises to the top. Homogenization is a process that breaks up the fat globules and evenly distributes them throughout the milk so that they do not rise. This process unnaturally increases the surface area of fat exposing it to air, in which oxidation occurs and increases the susceptibility to spoilage. Homogenization has been linked to heart disease and atherosclerosis.\nMilk: To Drink or Not to Drink?\nConsidering how modern commercial milk is produced and processed, it's no wonder that millions of Americans are allergic to it. An allergic reaction to dairy can cause symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting (even projectile vomiting), stomach pain, cramping, gas, bloating, nausea, headaches, sinus and chest congestion, and a sore, or scratchy throat. Milk consumption has been linked to many other health conditions as well, such as asthma, atherosclerosis, diabetes, chronic infections (especially upper respiratory and ear infections), obesity, osteoporosis and cancer of the prostate, ovaries, breast and colon.\nOnce you understand how modern milk is produced and processed, it seems logical to just avoid it altogether. But Real Milk--full-fat, unprocessed milk from pasture-fed cows--contains vital nutrients like fat-soluble vitamins A and D, calcium, vitamin B6, B12, and CLA (conjugated linoleic acid, a fatty acid naturally occurring in grass-fed beef and milk that reduces body fat and protects against cancer). Real milk is a source of complete protein and is loaded with enzymes. Raw milk contains beneficial bacteria that protects against pathogens and contributes to a healthy flora in the intestines. Culturing milk greatly enhances its probiotic and enzyme content, making it a therapeutic food for our digestive system and overall health.\nSo the answer to the question is--go ahead and drink milk only if you can get unprocessed milk from pastured cows. In the meantime, here are a few steps that can help you make the transition to more natural dairy products.\nSTEP 1: Remove Commercial Milk from Your Diet\nNormally I propose a step-by step process for making a dietary change, but considering where commercial milk has come from, and what it has been through, it is best to just remove it from the diet altogether. Instead use some of the better quality dairy products such as raw cheese, good quality whole yogurt, butter and cream that has not been ultrapasteurized. (You can use butter or cream mixed with water on breakfast porridge.) Check the Weston A. Price Foundation Shopping Guide for a listing of good quality dairy products sold in supermarkets and health food stores.\nSTEP 2: Find a Source of Real Milk in Your Area\nIn states like California, this is easy because raw milk is sold in health food stores. In other states you need to either purchase raw milk from a farm or through a cow-share program. The best place to start is by contacting your local chapter or visiting the realmilk.com website. Most people who cannot tolerate commercial milk do beautifully on Real Milk--milk that comes from pastured cows, that contains all the fat and that is unprocessed. It is an especially good food for growing children who need extra nutrients during their growing years.\nREFERENCES\nNutrition News and Views, Nov/Dec 1999, Vol 3, No.6, p. 2.\nThe Next Bad Beef Scandal?\" US News & World Report, September 1, 1997.\nNutrition News and Views, Nov/Dec 1999, Vol 3, No.6, p 2.\nMark Kastel, Down on the Farm: The Real BGH Story- Animal Health Problems, Financial Troubles,\" published by Rural Vermont, 1991.\nAndrew Christiansen, Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone: Alarming Tests, Unfounded Approval: The Story Behind the Rush to Bring rBGH to Market,\" published by Rural Vermont, 1991.\nThis article appeared in Wise Traditions in Food, Farming and the Healing Arts, the quarterly magazine of the Weston A.

Don\u2019t Drink It\nPosted March 13, 2012 | 0 comments\nBy By Adam Langer, DVM, MPH, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nYou may have recently heard about people getting sick from raw milk, or milk that has not been pasteurized (heated to kill germs). We have talked about its dangers before on this blog \u00e2\u0080\u0094and we want to give you some important updated information to help keep you and your family members from becoming ill.\nNew Raw Milk Study\nA new CDC study looked at outbreaks related to dairy products over a 14-year period in the U.S. and found:\nRaw milk was much more likely to cause outbreaks than pasteurized milk\nOutbreaks caused by raw milk tended to cause more severe disease\nYounger people were affected more in outbreaks caused by raw milk than in outbreaks caused by pasteurized milk\nStates that allow the sale of raw milk had more outbreaks caused by consuming raw milk\nDrinking Raw Milk is Not Worth the Risk\nSome people claim that there are health benefits of drinking raw milk. They may think that raw milk provides better nutrition than pasteurized milk.\u00c2\u00a0 This is simply not true.\u00c2\u00a0 Studies have shown that the nutrients in milk are not significantly affected by pasteurization. In fact, by consuming raw milk rather than fortified, pasteurized milk, consumers miss out on an opportunity to include a good source of vitamin D in their diets.\u00c2\nEven healthy adults can get sick from drinking raw milk. For some, getting sick from raw milk can mean diarrhea, stomach cramping, and vomiting, often for days. For others, it can mean kidney failure, paralysis, chronic disorders, and even death. Drinking raw milk is not worth the risk.\nAlthough many foods can be enjoyed raw, milk and products made from it should never be one of them. Raw milk is a risky source of entirely preventable foodborne illness and can be contaminated with a variety of germs that can make people sick.\nHow can raw milk make you sick?\nRaw milk and other raw dairy products can carry harmful bacteria and other germs that can make you very sick or kill you. Cows and other dairy animals can carry many different types of bacteria that can cause illness in people.\u00c2\u00a0 These animals usually don\u2019t appear to be sick because often they are not affected by these bacteria. These animals appear healthy and clean, but the bacteria can be present in their feces, in the milk itself, and on their skin, as well as in the environment of the dairy.\u00c2 Pasteurization is absolutely necessary to eliminate these bacteria from the milk and make it safe to consume.\nNo matter what precautions dairy farmers take or what they feed their animals, and even if laboratory tests for bacteria come back negative, they cannot guarantee that their unpasteurized milk, or products made from it, is free of harmful germs. You can\u2019t look at, smell, or taste a bottle of raw milk and tell if it is safe to drink.\nWhat You Can Do\nAs a consumer, you can take steps to minimize the risk of getting sick:\nOnly consume pasteurized milk and milk products. Look for the word \u201cpasteurized\u201d on the dairy labels. If in doubt, don\u2019t buy it!\nKeep all dairy products refrigerated at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below at home and dispose of any expired products to reduce the risk of illness.\nIf you consume soft, fresh, un-aged cheeses like queso fresco, make sure they are made from pasteurized milk. Aged cheeses made from raw milk are generally okay to eat because germs usually die off during the aging process. However, outbreaks associated with these aged cheeses have been identified.\nFor more information, check out these resources:\n"}, {"score": 498.33835, "uuid": "0bda14a4-4e68-53c1-bf4c-f9612644400b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0003wb-85-24854", "target_hostname": "foodpoisoning.pritzkerlaw.com", "target_uri": "http://foodpoisoning.pritzkerlaw.com/archives/food-safety-raw-milk-and-foodborne-illness.html", "page_rank": 1.1737337e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Raw Milk and Foodborne Illness : Food Poisoning Law Blog : Food", "snippet": "FDA&#x27;s pasteurization requirement also applies to other milk products, with the exception of a few aged <em>cheeses</em>.

This is based on information in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report for the week of March 2, 2007.\u00a0 The actual number of illnesses was almost certainly higher because not all cases of illness are recognized and reported.\nConsumers who become ill after consuming raw milk, and pregnant women who believe they consumed contaminated raw milk or cheese made from raw milk, should see a doctor or other health care provider immediately.\nSymptoms of illness caused by raw milk vary depending on which harmful bacteria are present. Symptoms may include but are not limited to: vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, headache and body ache.\nMost healthy people will recover from illness caused by harmful bacteria in raw milk or in foods made with raw milk within a short period of time. \u00a0But some individuals can develop symptoms that are chronic, severe, or even life-threatening. \u00a0Illnesses caused by pathogens found in raw milk can be especially severe for pregnant women, the elderly, infants, young children and people with weakened immune systems.\nSince 1987, in order to better protect consumers from such risks, FDA has required all milk packaged for human consumption be pasteurized before being delivered for introduction into\u00a0interstate commerce.\u00a0 Pasteurization, a process that heats milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time, kills bacteria responsible for diseases such as listeriosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria and brucellosis.\u00a0 FDA's pasteurization requirement also applies to other milk products, with the exception of a few aged cheeses.\nProponents of drinking raw milk often claim that raw milk is more nutritious than pasteurized milk and that raw milk is inherently antimicrobial, thus making pasteurization unnecessary.\u00a0 Research has shown that these claims are myths. There is no meaningful nutritional difference between pasteurized and raw milk, and raw milk does not contain compounds that will kill harmful bacteria.\nIn fact, raw milk, no matter how carefully produced, may be unsafe. The CDC, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments, the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the Association of Food and Drug Officials and other organizations have endorsed the pasteurization of milk and restriction of the sale of products containing raw milk.\u00a0 Because even pasteurized milk contains low levels of nonpathogenic bacteria that can cause food to spoil, it is important to keep pasteurized milk refrigerated.\nRaw Milk Q&A [FDA]\n"}, {"score": 470.6118, "uuid": "ecf03383-1697-5604-a464-85bffe2f18c7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0911wb-83-26268", "target_hostname": "www.mambosprouts.com", "target_uri": "http://www.mambosprouts.com/blog/food-nutrition/why-you-should-try-goat-milk-products/", "page_rank": 1.1879608e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Why You Should Try Goat Milk Products | Mambo Sprouts - Organic", "snippet": "If the lactose in <em>pasteurized</em> cow\u2019s milk gives you an upset stomach, try drinking goat\u2019s milk.

Read more reviews\nWhy You Should Try Goat Milk Products\nShare |\nMilk, cheese, yogurt, kefir\u2026 these are all products that come from cows, right? Well, while that\u2019s true, it\u2019s important to branch out and discover new things! Goats provide the same products with their dairy, and with a distinct taste and texture. Some may say that goat dairy is an acquired taste \u2013 if that\u2019s the case, the acquiring doesn\u2019t take very long! Try sprinkling goat cheese on a fresh, homemade pizza \u2013 delicious! Or drizzle goat yogurt over fresh berries with sweet honey and be amazed. We really like Liberte \u2013\u00a0their goat yogurt is smooth, silky and full of sharp flavor. You may find that the creamy tartness of goat dairy is a better choice for many dishes.\nAnd did you know that goats have just one stomach, unlike cows with their four? This means that the way goat milk is produced may result in easier digestion for us! If the lactose in pasteurized cow\u2019s milk gives you an upset stomach, try drinking goat\u2019s milk. You may like it better than lactose-free cow\u2019s milk. Goat\u2019s milk does contain lactose, like cow\u2019s milk. But it contains more vitamin A, Calcium, Potassium and Magnesium. And it is a great source of minerals and protein and it is low in fat.\nYou can find goat\u2019s milk, cheese, yogurt and kefir in most grocery stores, but you might have to look around. For milk, yogurt and kefir, just look on the label for the word \u201cgoat\u201d! For cheese, it may be a bit more difficult. Look for the words \u201cgoat\u201d, \u201cchevre\u201d (French), or \u201ccapra\u201d (Spanish). You can try it plain, with herbs, or in feta form. Just check the label to make sure that it is from a goat, not a cow. Some cheeses can have tricky labels. When in doubt, ask a fromager at the market when you are shopping. Look for unpasteurized for more complex, rich flavor.\nYou can also try goat ice cream, goat butter, and goat buttermilk.\nDid you know that goat\u2019s milk is also cherished for its skin-improving benefits? We love Zum and Canus products. Zum goat-milk-based soaps are naturally pH-balanced with your skin, so you won\u2019t feel greasy or dry. And the healing properties of goat\u2019s milk are harnessed in pure lotion, soap and bubble bath products from Canus . Pampering your skin and nourishing your body is completely natural with valuable goat\u2019s milk.\nRelated Items\n"}, {"score": 434.53455, "uuid": "3edb0df8-1bfd-593c-aa64-dc638bc4ca86", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1500wb-92-12957", "target_hostname": "livinlavidalowcarb.com", "target_uri": "http://livinlavidalowcarb.com/blog/guest-blog-post-4-reasons-why-france-is-raw-milk-heaven/8764", "page_rank": 1.1728163e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Guest Blog Post: 4 Reasons Why France Is Raw Milk Heaven &laquo; Jimmy", "snippet": "I don\u2019t know about the safety of keeping <em>unpasteurized</em> milk for that long, but I do know it <em>tastes</em> fine for much, much longer <em>than</em> <em>pasteurized</em>.

I\u2019m still having a good time being on vacation with Christine\u2019s family in the state of Indiana this week, but I\u2019ve got a special guest blog post I wanted to share with you from a reader who hails from the country of France and is absolutely perplexed by all the legal hangups over the sale of raw milk in America. As someone who grew up in the United States and now living with her husband in a different culture altogether that embraces raw milk as a regular part of their daily livelihood, she wanted to tell us about the incredible ways it is being used by the French in their diet. Her name is Sarah from one of the blogs I highlighted before I left on my trip called Low Stress Weight Loss . Special thanks to Sarah for offering up this outstanding column that will certainly educate you about what is happening elsewhere in the world with raw milk even if we are still somewhat backwards here in America. If you like what you read at Sarah\u2019s blog, then let her hear from you by leaving a comment below and on one of the posts at her site.\nHere is her guest blog post:\nMy name is Sarah and I\u2019m an American ex-patriot living in France. I have to say I listen to stories of the regulated raw milk market back in the States with great puzzlement. I\u2019m an American living in France and here raw milk is everywhere. It\u2019s not as prevalent as pasteurized milk, of course, (even the French have moved to industrialized production of most foods), but the French are very protective of their gastronomic history.\u00c2\u00a0 That history is heavily rooted in cream\u2026and butter\u2026and cheese.\u00c2\u00a0 Despite the fact that Louis Pasteur (the inventor of \u201cpasteurization\u201d) was French, the highest-quality, most-sought-after dairy products are all made from raw, not pasteurized, dairy.\nHere are 4 reasons why France is raw milk heaven:\n1) Cheese\nThe most famous (and delicious) French cheeses are made with raw milk.\u00c2\u00a0 Camembert, Brie, Roquefort, and all of the best of these cheeses are made with raw milk. \u00c2\u00a0 Other than cheddar cheese (which I buy for Mexican food that I make myself) and store-bought ricotta and mascarpone, most of the cheese I buy is made from raw milk.\u00c2\u00a0 Sheep\u2019s milk, goat\u2019s milk, cow\u2019s milk, water buffalo milk\u2013all of it is raw.\u00c2\u00a0 Raw milk cheeses are sold in grocery stores and little corner markets too all across France.\u00c2\u00a0 You can find industrial cheeses too such as cream cheese, crazily shelf-stable grated cheeses, plastic-packaged (and tasting) kid-pack cheese products, and very weak imitations of the famous French cheeses. But most people, even of modest means, prefer the raw stuff, and most grocers oblige them, despite the shorter shelf life.\u00c2\u00a0 Cheese in all it\u2019s forms is a living organism, although I don\u2019t know how many people go in for the living critter crusts of some of the really rural farm cheeses ( spider cheese is worth checking out if you have a strong stomach and large curiosity).\n2)\u00c2 Butter\nThere is a big debate in Paris, and it involves fat and salt found in butter.\u00c2\u00a0 Salted (in particular for those from the Brittany region\u2013like my husband) or \u201cSweet\u201d (unsalted) is the point of contention.\u00c2\u00a0 But no one denies that the best boutique brands of butter that are served in the top Michelin-starred restaurants are made from raw milk.\u00c2\u00a0 People traverse Paris to go to the cheese shops that stock those brands and I\u2019m very lucky that my local cheese market carries one of those brands.\u00c2\u00a0 In our house, we use Salted butter and the flavor is unbelievable.\u00c2\u00a0 I\u2019m not the only one who thinks this brand is amazing, by the way\u2013food blogger extraordinaire David Lebovitz has also blogged about this same amazing brand of butter . Twice.\n3) Cream\nCream is a whole series of products in France, actually.\u00c2\u00a0 There is cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, which is a cultured cream which is made somewhat like yogurt\u2013a fermenting bacteria is added to cream, and it renders a tangy and unbelievably rich product.\u00c2\u00a0 Like other dairy products in general supermarkets, you find this cooking staple pasteurized, but once again the best ones are made from raw milk and have a much richer, deeper flavor and an unbelievably rich texture. Also, you can find liquid cream which is also available in unpasteurized raw form, although it\u2019s pretty hard to find (my local organic supermarket carries it, but I have to stock up quickly, because the whole neighborhood seems to want this and it\u2019s more often just the sign on the shelf instead of a stock with bottles).\u00c2\u00a0 It sometimes seems to spoil rather quickly, which just encourages me to use it quickly. Besides, the trips to the store to see if it\u2019s in stock adds extra steps into my week\u2013two out of three times I strike out.\n4) Raw milk\nI can buy raw milk at the local organic supermarket or at the cheese market near our house.\u00c2\u00a0 People who live in the countryside might just get it from their neighbor.\u00c2\u00a0 On vacation this summer we came across this at the entry of a big chain supermarket in the Center region of France:\u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThat\u2019s right: it\u2019s a self-service raw milk dispenser like the self-service filtered water dispensers I remember in American supermarkets as a kid.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 On the left side, you buy your bottle.\u00c2\u00a0 On the right, you insert your money and get your raw milk.\u00c2\u00a0 As one of the couples walking in beside us remarked \u201cwhat, do they have a cow behind that wall?\u201d \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Toto, we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore!\nSarah blogs about losing weight without losing her mind at Low Stress Weight Loss .\u00c2\u00a0 An American in Paris, she\u2019s married to a French man, and after several failed diet attempts in France realized a lower-carb diet might be a better match for rich sauces and wonderful French butter and cheese than the low-fat fare of her previous dieting attempts.\nAugust 12th, 2010 | Tags: blog , butter , cheese , cream , diet , fat , France , healthy , Jimmy Moore , legal , low stress weight loss , low-carb , milk , raw milk , sarah , United States | Category: 1\nDonna Kuck DVM\nCleanliness of the dairy, the cow, the equipment \u2013 are all keys in producing safe, raw milk products. In California, an Organic Milk producing dairy cannot use antibiotics on their cows. If she gets sick and needs antibiotic care, she is treated \u2013 but her milk can no longer be sold as organic, so she is usually sold to a neighboring non-organic dairy. Replacing her costs about $3000 to the dairy farmer, so he/she has a VERY strong drive to prevent infection. This means clean barns, extra care cleaning her before the milking machine is attached, etc. This is how cows SHOULD be treated. This results in less bacterial contamination of the milk, hence \u2013 you would expect, less need for pasteurization.\nYet, even though the certified Organic Milk products are produced with more care \u2013 most are still pasteurized. We have learned to expect a long shelf life on our dairy products. Milk is a great food to grow bacteria. With even the cleanest facility, there are always a few bacteria picked up from the cow or when the milk is transferred during bottling or processing. As soon as you open the container, you expose the milk to bacteria that are in the air, on surfaces of \u2018clean\u2019 dishes, etc. The \u2018good\u2019 bacteria give us fermented milk products. The \u2018bad\u2019 bacteria cause spoiled milk. Pasteurization kills most of the bacteria so the milk can sit in your refrigerator for a couple of weeks before it \u2018goes bad.\u2019\nSo, common sense would indicate that if you want your milk to be unpasteurized, then you keep the cow clean, keep your equipment clean, use safe and approved handling processes \u2013 and still accept a SHORTER SHELF LIFE than the pasteurized product. It\u2019s worth it! And people have managed to do this safely for thousands of years!\nhttp://www.livinlavidalowcarb.com Jimmy Moore\nDonna, you\u2019re so right and I\u2019m privileged to live in a state (South Carolina) where raw milk and other raw dairy foods are legal.\nAngelo\nAnd still Donna people will still get extremely sick and some will die because of drinking Raw milk. I just hope nobodys child has to suffer because some knuckle-head parent thought they were doing the right thing.\nhttp://www.livinlavidalowcarb.com Jimmy Moore\nThere\u2019s no proof anyone is in danger drinking raw milk. There just isn\u2019t.\nboo\nCan the poster tell me if Echire butter is made from raw milk?\nKaty\nAngelo, yes, there is some risk involved whenever we consume food grown and produced by others; no food is 100% safe, including fruits, vegetables, eggs, meat, milk, cheese, and so on. Care certainly must be taken when food shopping, but I don\u2019t want the government telling me what I can or cannot purchase from those willing to produce it and sell it (such as raw milk or cheese). Will the FDA outlaw the selling of raw lettuce or strawberries or green onions? These products have been the subjects of recall due to contamination, but there aren\u2019t any plans to only sell cooked or heated versions of these foods.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_raw_milk_debate\nMatthew Unfried\nReally Angelo?! I was born and raised on raw milk and my lactose-intolerant wife (of two months) suddenly is NOT if she drinks real milk (not boiled)Edys ice cream shouldn\u2019t give you cramps and the trots!!!\nBTW, Angelo, no one has died in decades from raw/real milk consumption. If you went to college, you might consider thinking about doing some kind of research before letting your prejudices rule you. Cheers!\nhttp://thebunnellfarm.com/ Tom Bunnell\nThe danger factor is a given Jimmy regarding raw milk vs pasteurized milk. If the volume of raw milk consumption were the same as pasteurized, sickness and deaths resulting from raw milk would be ten if not a hundred fold greater, simply because of logistics if nothing more. \u2014 That said we all know that raw milk is far better in all regards as well as better for our health when not contaminated, which is probably 99.99 % of the time if not more. The greater issue here is still the lactose and the natural vs unnatural aspect in all this. We low carbers eat only the heavy cream and hard cheese and butter and that helps but doesn\u2019t completely eliminate this problem. Clarified butter gets us a little closer still but it too is unnatural in real life. Were we able to get and eat an abundance of wild game and plants we would all do that but it\u2019s almost impossible to do and in actuality it is impossible to do in this modern world, so we make the necessary concessions because we have too, while all the while trying to adhere as close to nature as possible. We need the fat so for many of us, we eat dairy. I float back and forth myself, sometimes including dairy and sometimes not. The dilemma we face has no simple solutions. \u2014 Drinking only water is simple, everything else is quite complex.\nhttp://www.livinlavidalowcarb.com Jimmy Moore\nMost people who drink raw milk are wise about how they store it and drink it. I\u2019m not worried.\nUlf\nI think the important thing to remember when it comes to raw milk and similar is to use common sense, and use your senses!

At this point even the \u201cbest\u201d brand I can get from the store already tastes spoiled to me when I first open it, whereas the raw tastes great for at least a week and a half. It only begins going sour after about two weeks.\nI don\u2019t know about the safety of keeping unpasteurized milk for that long, but I do know it tastes fine for much, much longer than pasteurized.\nhttp://lowstressweightloss.com Sarah @ Low Stress Weight Loss\nEchir\u00e9 butter as sold for export is pasteurized (as is pretty much all the \u201cpremium\u201d butter France exports). Even most of the domestic consumption is made from pasteurized cream, for a lot of the reasons cited in the discussion above.\nI don\u2019t doubt there is some risk from raw milk products, but I think the risk is pretty modest, and in my opinion probably less long-term health risk than what we run from US industrial cattle farming with high antibiotic use & hCG injections\u2026 Like many things in life, it\u2019s a question of choosing which risks you want to run, and which you want to avoid.\nFrance has one of the most advanced healthcare systems in the world (by most measures better than the US) and very vigilant monitoring of public health, and they eat proportionally many more raw milk products than we do in the US \u2013 if foodborne illness from these sources was a problem, we\u2019d hear about it (they also have an incredibly outspoken media!)\nStill, I think one thing that keeps any risk minimized is that in general the raw products are luxury products \u2013 sold at a premium for their taste & history. We pay about 50% more for food in France than the average grocery bill in the US, and even people of relatively modest means will splurge on good (raw milk) cheese from time to time.\nhttp://contradictoire.wordpress.com/ Arlene\nIt\u2019s nice that the raw milk is available, but most of the French I know drink UHT milk, that way they can store the milk in the cupboard since they have no place for fresh milk in their tiny fridges.\npjnoir\nI\u2019m very lucky to have easy access to Raw Milk \u2013 it has added a few more carbs to my diet but has been a powerhouse for strength training. This stuff is like a steroid. This is one of the healthiest products I have ever used- the diaries are a billion times cleaner than conventional farms and the farmers take care of there cows so much better. The only issue I have with the Laws in my state is that I cannot get cream or butter because it is looked as an added or extra value product and not allowed.\nthis video tells it all: http://vimeo.com/13418268 worth watching the whole thing.\ndrink up\nhttp://www.sugarfreelowcarbrecipes.com Lisa @ Sugar Free Low Carb Recipes\nI recently tried raw milk from a local farm here in Connecticut.

It started when I was like 12 or 14 when my mom made a wrapped brie appetizer for the holidays. Not that cheese wasn\u2019t a huge part of my life prior to this event. I am from the Midwest where dairy has its own sacred place in the food lexicon, but this was the first time that I\u2019d experienced anything outside of the hard block of yellow or white cheese. Since then, there have been numerous cheese platters. Some stand out more than others and while the cheese is definitely the highlight, it also has to do with who you are sharing it with and what you choose to go along with it.\nEarly this spring my sister and her boyfriend came down for a visit from Seattle and we decided to check out Steve\u2019s Cheese for the first time. Don\u2019t ask me why it took me so long to get over there, but it was years wasted in my opinion. The cheese and cured meats selection was wide and diverse and the service was exceptionally helpful and knowledgeable. The cheese platter we ended up with \u2013 largely made up of recommendations \u2013 was delightful. I don\u2019t know what other word to use. We paired the cheese and meat with some bread and vegetables that we had picked up at the farmer\u2019s market so we were truly fulfilling the northwest food geek stereotype.\nWe had three different cheeses all from the pacific northwest. They are all well known cheese makers and I\u2019ve run into these cheeses since then at cheese tastings and counters around town. That said all three are really delicious representations of pacific northwest cheese. The Willamette Valley Cheese \u2019s Boerenkass (a raw cow milk cheese) was mild, but really full of flavor and went really well with the bread and Fra Mani Sopressata.\nThis was the first time that I had tasted Rivers Edge Chevre \u2019s Up in Smoke (goat milk). This was unbelievably fantastic. I love goat cheese and I\u2019ve never tasted a goat cheese like this \u2013 rich, smoky, creamy. I\u2019ve had this over and over again since this first tasting. I liked eating it wrapped in the Iowa applewood smoked durroc ham we got from Steve\u2019s Cheese.\nThe final cheese was from Estrella Family Creamery . I first had their cheese after visiting the Ballard farmer\u2019s market so this was not a new cheese maker for us, but it was the first time I tasted their Guapier (cow milk). This cheese has a layer of ash running through the center separating the morning and evening milking. There really was a stark difference in taste between the two sides and it made for a fun tasting. It was a really delicious cheese that was really best \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 eaten by itself.\nThis was one of those really great cheese experiences. The company was fun and casual and into the cheese. And the cheese lived up to the moment with great flavors.\nFresh French Style Goat Cheese\nSeptember 13, 2008 at 9:50 am \u00b7 Filed under amanda , goat , making\nAfter making the chevre , the goat blanc , and the goat milk gelato , we still had a little over a half gallon of goat milk left (frozen) which was just perfect for the Fresh French Style Goat Cheese recipe that came with my goat cheese kit from Ricki Carrol\u2019s suppy company .\nThis recipe had all sorts of new things to learn: making a culture, keeping the cheese at a high temperature for a long period of time, and using molds. I made a lot of mistakes.\nFor the culture, I went out and purchased some canning jars and followed the directions. The goat cheese kit comes with a fresh culture packet and directions for how to do this. Basically, you just boil a quart of skim milk and then let it set out and cool. What you should try not to do is permanently warp your husband\u2019s brew kettle and scorch the top of your stove. Which is what might happen if you have a jar sitting on the bottom of a thin metal pot which is also huge because you have no other pot that is large enough to cover the jar. And said kettle hangs over the sides of your burners by a couple inches thus creating a perfectly hot environment, reflecting the heat onto the top of your stove. Oh well, it\u2019s an ugly stove anyway\u2026.\nAfter the milk has cooled, you add the culture packet, swirl it around gently and let it sit. I blame the gorgeous weekend combined with family in town that caused me to let it sit a little longer than the 15-24 hours called for\u2026 say, 24-48 hours? I cautiously opened it up and it smelled good and looked good so I put that extra 24 hours out of my mind and stuck it in the fridge until I could get around to the cheesemaking.\nI took a portion of the fresh culture and used it in the very simple French Style Goat Cheese recipe and then moved on to the next step which was to set the cheese out for 24 hours at 86-degrees. Um\u2026 what? There was much consulting of friends and asking around for a friend\u2019s yogurt maker (missing) and suggestions to let it set by a heater for 24 hours (husband) and putting it in a warm oven (mine only goes down to 175) and finally I threw up my hands, wrapped it in a blanket while it was still warm and ignored it. It was a warm-ish day, around 80, and I just didn\u2019t know what else I could do.\nI took the leftover culture and froze it in an ice-cube tray which I had previously sterilized in boiling water. Supposedly, you can use a single ice-cube to make another quart of fresh culture. It\u2019s a self-perpetuating system!\nSo, that\u2019s two mistakes of unknown consequences. In any case, I came back a day later and carefully lifted the lid on the pot (my new Favorit stainless steel pot that I got from IKEA for this purpose) and stuck my nose in there. Smelled good! It was still a bit warm and smelled like yummy goat cheese! Hooray!\nI thought that I would need to hang this cheese before putting it in the molds or at least weighting it in molds to get the whey out but the directions said just to put it in the molds, turning them occasionally. I filled the molds about 3/4 full with the jelly-like curds and whey and set them in a casserole dish and covered it with cloth to keep cats and flies away.\nI was so dubious at this point. It just seemed like things would just sit there. It was like a miracle when I lifted the cloth about ten hours later to see about an inch and a half of whey sitting in the dish. I drained that off and left it for a whole day, draining it off once more. Basically, the cheeses just got firmer and firmer and the whey just drained off of its own accord. When all that was left was about a 1/2\u2033 puck of cheese I pulled them carefully out of the molds, sprinkled them with cheese salt (does not come in the kit), wrapped them up in wax paper and put them in the fridge.\nThe most important thing \u2014 how did they taste? Well, my husband and I smeared a good helping on some roasted garlic bread which we got from the bakery and it\u2019s pretty good. I think it needs more salt and some herbs. I\u2019m going over today to meet the other cheese ladies (we\u2019re making a press!) and I\u2019ll bring this for spreading over bagels. I think they need a little herbs as well. It\u2019s so hard to tell how much salt to use. Obviously, you don\u2019t want to oversalt but salt really does make the flavor emerge and really makes the cheese. When we did the fromage blanc, it didn\u2019t really achieve a state of total tastiness until we added salt. And the fresh chevre which we made was really amazing once we added the fresh herbs and salt.\nThere are two notes on rennet with this recipe. One says that if the cheese comes out too rubbery then you are adding too much rennet. The other note says that if too much curd comes out the holes when you put the cheese in the molds then you did not add enough rennet. A little curd came out the holes and the cheese seems a little more on the rubbery side than I thought it would. So, I guess it\u2019s just right? I don\u2019t know. This recipe really brought home how many variables there can be in cheeses and how complicated things can get. On the other hand, with all my little mistakes and uncertainties, these came out pretty well. On a third hand, in the middle of all of this, with family visiting, I managed to make a very delicious blueberry ice-cream which everyone enjoyed. The end.\nFankhauser knows cheese!\nAugust 30, 2008 at 3:07 pm \u00b7 Filed under amanda , education\nI recently was turned on to David Fankhauser\u2019s excellent cheese page . Mr. Fankhauser is a professor of Biology and Chemistry at the University of Cincinatti Clermont College. He has really dug into the science of cheesemaking and created a great resource for home cheesemakers. Check it out!\nRogue Creamery in Central Point, Oregon\nAugust 30, 2008 at 8:21 am \u00b7 Filed under amanda , dairy\nThom and I did a weekend trip down to Southern Oregon, and stopped at the Rogue Creamery in Central Point . The Creamery has been making cheeses since the 1930s and is now very well-known for its blue cheeses, especially the Rogue River Blue which has won a number of awards and is wrapped in grape leaves and aged for 1 year.\nCentral Point is a small town in the Rogue River Valley in a part of Oregon that is generally sunnier and warmer than where we live in Portland. Along the Rogue River Valley Highway, also known as Highway 99 and known in Central Point as Front Street, is a very unassuming concrete building which houses the Creamery cheese shop and part of their manufacturing facility.\nThe cozy little cheese shop has samples of all their signature cheeses. I tried several of their cheddars, a few of their blues and also some of their flavored cheddars including lavendar, garlic and chocolate stout. I was really taken with that last one and we picked up some of that.\nThey also have a cheese case with cheeses from around the region and the very knowledgeable and friendly cheese ladies gave us samples of anything we wanted. From the cheese case we ended up selecting PondHopper, a cheese from Tumalo Farms in Bend which is a hard, aged goat cheese, unique for the hops that are added while steeping the curds. We also picked up Truffle Tremor from Cypress Grove, another goat cheese (I have a problem) \u2014 creamy and infused with the taste of truffles.\nIn looking at all the cheeses, chatting with the ladies, choosing some pear wine and some crackers and debating the merits of purchasing an insulated bag (we did), we totally forgot to swing back around and pick up some butter!\nDoesn\u2019t that look like the most wonderful butter in the whole world? I guess we\u2019ll have to go back.\nCheck out a few more photos of the cheese shop on my flickr . You will find Rogue Creamery cheeses in reputable cheese shops all over Oregon, at Whole Foods, New Seasons, etc. and on their website which also has some great photos of their cheesemaking process.\n"}, {"score": 412.98438, "uuid": "1af12895-4d59-53c8-a6e6-537b3adfb080", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1804wb-40-17957", "target_hostname": "fountainheadchicago.com", "target_uri": "http://fountainheadchicago.com/author/thefount/page/2/", "page_rank": 1.189335e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Author Archives | Fountainhead Chicago", "snippet": "\u2026 If you are among the ranks that worship stilton as the king of <em>cheese</em>, <em>than</em> look no further <em>than</em> this Vermont variation of the British classic.

Hops are subdued, but present a well-considered balance with the juicy ripeness of grain and a fruity, meringue softness. 8.0% ABV\nSt-Feuillien Saison \u2013 St. Feuillien\u2019s Saison is what the Belgians call a beer of the terroir, a traditional farmhouse ale with all the rich savor of the fertile land of southern Belgium. Saison, a warm golden blonde ale , is a top fermented classique. Thanks to secondary fermentation in the bottle, Saison has an unmistakable flavor full of nuances and a slight tang.\u00a0 6.5% ABV\nTripel Karmeliet \u2013 Brewed with oats, barley and wheat, Tripel Karmeliet has soft, full, rich grain character with hints of banana, vanilla, and a slight, pleasing bubble-gum aroma. A restrained hop bitterness offers perfect balance and a gentle counterpart to its substantial maltiness. 8.0% ABV\nBockor Omer \u2013 Pale golden and extraordinary, Omer has a firm malt character with a pleasant hop bitterness and warm, bready aroma. Tasted in it\u2019s signature glass it\u2019s a treat for the eye and palate. 8.0% ABV\nB. United Imports:\nDulle Teve \u2013 Brewed in the tradition of a Belgian Triple. Its high density stems from large amounts of pale malt increased with pale candy sugar in the brew kettle. It is unfiltered and unpasteurized with a bittering of about 30 IBU due to the Goldings hops in the brew kettle. The original De Dulle Teve, meaning \u2018Mad Bitch\u2019 was a one time brew and had been forgotten until a couple of years ago when the de Dolle Brewers thought that making a good triple would not be a bad idea. 10% ABV\nSmisje Dubbel \u2013 Johan Brandt , with a passion for excellent good beer, started this tiny artisanal brewery end of 1995. In the beginning he brewed only once a week with a capacity of 120 liters (1 barrel). By 1999 he started brewing twice a week with an increased capacity of 160 liters (1.5 barrels), meaning non stop brewing, bottling, washing bottles throughout the year. He is now looking for a bigger brewery where he can brew 700 liters (6 barrels) at a time and fill the bottles automatically. Johan Brandt, also a bee-keeper, started out with only one type of beer, a honey beer called \u2018t Smisje. He now produces 6 permanent beers including this Dubble spiced with Honey, Fresh Real Dates, Dark and Light Candy Sugar.\nDe Dolle Boskeun \u2013 Boskeun is the nickname of Jo, one of the two brothers who started the brewery. As a home brewer, some of his favorite beer to produce were strong blond ales. The word Boskeun means \u201crabbit\u201d, or \u201chare\u201d, so they decided to brew one of his favorite types of beer as a celebration of Easter. It has been brewed with pale malt, Golding hops, cane sugar and re-fermented with native honey. 10% ABV\nPicobrouwerij Alvinne Wild Undressed \u2013 Wild Undressed is very nice lactic acid, mellow and yet clear sour,aged inn Monbazillac wine barrels. Monbazillac is a French sweet wine with notes of honey, vanilla, apricot, orange. 5.5 ABV\nGlobal Imports:\nTroubadour Obscura - Dark in color, as you would expect from a stout.\u00a0 Slightly more red-brown, though, when compared with Irish stouts. A dense rich creamy beige head crowns your glass. The flavors are deeper, richer, more pronounced: malty, clearly roasted (is it hints of coffee, is it hints of chocolate?) Deceptive, because the relatively high alcohol content is not immediately felt, except maybe a slight glowing sensation.\u00a0 A complex aftertaste, with some licorice undertones, and a pleasant bitterness survives last. 8.5% ABV\nPetrus Oud Bruin Ale \u2013 Dark ruby red, as red wine. The style is also called the Burgundy of Flanders, and is a very typical and common beer in West Flanders. A sour-sweet balance is discovered, set off by the underlying bitterness of the hops. Light in alcohol, the alcohol doesn\u2019t hide or overpower the exciting flavors and tastes in this unique beer.\nWooden flavors? Indeed, Old Brown beer is aged for over two years in huge oak casks. During this aging process, just like in wine, lactic acids develop. These acids are responsible for the sour part in the taste. 5.5% ABV\nPoperings Hommel \u2013 This beer is a one of a kind ale, that you can best classify with the other Strong Golden Ales from Belgium. What makes it special is of course the yeast, and what makes it unique is the higher amounts of hops used. This beer has about twice the bitterness of other Belgian beers. Poperings Hommel ale is brewed with a blend of summer, winter and aromatic pale malts. The brewery has its own well where soft water is found, and only local grown hops from the Gold and Hallertau family all of this gives Hommel a roselike floweriness, honeyish notes, orange-zest hop flavors and a late spicy, and a cuminseed dryness. 7.5% ABV\nBruges Zot Blond Unfiltered \u2013 The only beer that is actually brewed and lagered in Brugge (Bruges), the fierce medieval town in Flanders, the Venice of the North.\u00a0 Pale blond ale, crowned with a white head, blooms with a fruity pronounced aroma, hints of lemon, and hits the palate with a refreshing dryness, embellished by hints of spices and orange, balanced by an underlying faint malty sweetness. The beer finishes with a short, fruity taste that somewhat sticks to the palate. The unfiltered version is only available at the Brewery\u2019s Pub in\u00a0Brugge has been released to the US for the first time!! 6% ABV\nMerchant du Vin Imports:\nOrval \u2013 Sunset-orange color; a fruity and slightly acidic bouquet, firm body, profound hop bitterness, and long, dry finish. Orval is bottled with Brettanomyces, a yeast strain that leads to superb dry complexity and ageworthiness. 6.9% ABV\nRochefort 10 \u2013 Dark brown color. Great strength balanced by a complexity of flavors and firm malt backbone. The bouquet covers a wide range: port wine, leather, apricots, oak, spices \u2013 a deeply intriguing beverage. 11.3% ABV\nWestmalle Dubbel \u2013 A dark, reddish-brown Trappist beer with a secondary fermentation in the bottle. The creamy head has the fragrance of special malt and leaves an attractive lace pattern in the glass. The flavour is rich and complex, herby and fruity with a fresh-bitter finish. It is a balanced quality beer with a soft feel in the mouth and a long, dry aftertaste. 7% ABV\nWestmalle Triple \u2013 A clear, golden yellow Trappist beer that undergoes a secondary fermentation in the bottle. It is a complex beer with a fruity aroma and a nice nuanced hop scent. It is soft and creamy in the mouth, with a bitter touch carried by the fruity aroma. An exceptional beer, with a great deal of finesse and elegance, with a splendid long aftertaste. 9.5% ABV\nVanberg & Dewulf Imports:\nSaison Dupont \u2013 A world classic beer and the yardstick for one of Belgium\u2019s most important beer styles. It is the most admired and imitated Saison in the world. Saison Dupont is a wonderful straw color with a dense creamy head. The nose is alive, like fresh raised bread, estery with citrus and spice notes. Full-bodied and malty, it sparkles on the palate and finishes with a zesty hop and citrus attack. Incredibly compatible with food! 6.5 ABV\nBrouwerij De Troch Lambrucha \u2013 The mystic marriage of two fermented drinks: lambic and kombucha. The first time two different types of live yeast drinks (lambic and Kombucha fermented tea) have been blended together to create a completely new, live yeast beverage. Lambrucha\u2122 is the brainchild of Don Feinberg, with technical assistance from Dr. Roger Mussche, one of the world\u2019s leading authorities on Brettanomyces yeast. A deliciously tart effervescent beverage is created by pitching yeast into tea and letting it ferment. Kombucha is renowned for its probiotic, health-giving benefits. Lambic is the justly revered spontaneously fermenting beer from the Senne River Valley in Belgium. Lambic contains some 500 different yeasts and is the oldest continuously brewed style of beer in the world. 3.5 ABV\nScheldebrouwerij Hopruiter \u2013 This strong golden ale combines Belgian appreciation for aromatic esters with the American love of hops. But unlike American IPA\u2019s and Belgian IPA wannabes, Hop Ruiter celebrates the finesse Belgians bring to using hops. Three different varieties (none American) are used; one in the boil and two in dry hopping. The combination of type and technique gives Hop Ruiter a tannic, almost oaky hop acidity reminiscent of good white wines. If you\u2019re expecting American piney, resiny hops that fur your tongue, Hop Ruiter will disappoint. But if you want to enjoy noble hop aroma and fine bitterness that perfectly marries with malt sweetness to make an exceptionally smooth, full-flavored beer, Hop Ruiter will delight. 8% ABV\nScaldis Peche Mel - What do you get when you brew a slightly lighter version of classic Scaldis and add peach juice? A deliciously drinkable beer with the heady aroma of peach, a well balanced malt character, and a surprisingly dry finish. Based on a favorite drink made by students that combined peach lambic and classic Scaldis, Peche Mel redefines what a beer with fruit can taste like! 8.5 ABV\nCHEESES TO BE TASTED INCLUDE:\nGreen Fields ~ Raw Cow\u2019s Milk ~ Saxon Homestead Creamery ~ Cleveland, WI \u2013 Green Fields is an earthy, elegant table cheese which draws inspiration from the classic monastery cheeses. Its sweet, nutty tones vary with the seasons. A semi-soft washed rind from raw cow\u2019s milk, carefully tended for 70 days This is true family-farmed cheese from Wisconsin and the price is great for what you get. This is an Oka-style cheese for all you Canadian immigrants out there. Buttery and pungent.\nTilston Point ~ Pasteurized Cow\u2019s Milk ~ Hook\u2019s Cheese Co. ~ Mineral Point, WI \u2013 Though the name recalls stilton, the king of blues, this cheese is truly an American original:\u00a0 Dense like stilton, but more unctuous and granular like Roquefort, and in terms of its flavor, it is in a category all its own.\u00a0 Tony washes the wheels in a secret concoction, which encourages the development of the delectable little b. linen bacteria, most famously responsible for lending stinky cheeses their characteristic funk.\u00a0 These bacteria no doubt are responsible for the array of flavors found in Tilston point which range from earthy and nutty to distinctive mineral notes.\nRaspberry Bellavitano ~ Pasteurized Cow\u2019s Milk ~ Sartori ~ Plymouth, WI \u2013 The Bellavitano line of cheeses from sartori was designed to combine the rich, fruity creaminess of a young cheese with the crystalline crunch that distinguishes premium aged cheeses.\u00a0 This particular manifestation is washed in the New Glarus Raspberry Tart Ale to further accentuate the naturally fruity notes of this cheese.\u00a0 The result is a totally snackable, almost cheddar like cheese, that smells like sticking your head into a vat of haribo gummi raspberries, and finishes by imparting a lingering tanginess on your tongue.\nPipers Pyramid ~ Pasteurized Goat\u2019s Milk ~ Capriole ~ Greenville, IN \u2013 A luscious, fluffy pyramid of pure fresh chevre dusted with a touch of paprika.\u00a0 Its delicate geotrichum rind can can develop a light mottling of\u00a0 fuzzy blue molds with age, that add a little spice to piper\u2019s already compelling profile; the clean, tangy flavor of the goats\u2019 milk gets a subtle little kick in the pants from the spice, leaving a slightly sweet, hot, and smokey finish.\u00a0 With age these guys get increasingly oozy just under the rind and develop a slightly more savory, musky quality.\u00a0 10 oz of palatable perfection!\nGoodhue ~ ORGANIC Raw Cow\u2019s Milk ~ K&K for Pasture Land Co-op ~ Goodhue, MN \u2013 This grass fed gouda is proof that collective labors often bear tastier fruit!\u00a0 This cheese is made just over the WI border in what is still part of the driftless region that encompasses Pasturelands by the good folks at k&K cheese in Cashton, WI and is then carefully aged out by Felix at Capri cheesery.\u00a0 The bright golden hue of the paste proves that this cheese is indeed made from a solely pasture fed herd (the fat globules in cow\u2019s milk trap the beta carotene from the pastures grasses and flora, and hence the golden hue).\u00a0 This cheese is as tasty and bold as its beautiful color would suggest; warm bready and nutty flavors abound with hints of butterscotch, rye and caraway. As the cheese matures its flavors push more toward the realm of the savory with mushroomy, and earthy notes surfacing after about 6 months of aging.\nShepherd\u2019s Hope ~ Pasteurized Sheep\u2019s Milk ~ Shepherd\u2019s Way Farms ~ Nerstrand, MN \u2013 Made from pasteurized milk and originally based on a traditional queso fresco recipe for cow milk, Shepherd\u2019s Hope is a slightly firmer but still soft, fresh cheese. It is produced in either plain or garlic & herb versions.\u00a0 For production, the curd is stirred by hand before being transferred into molds or hoops and allowed to drain under its own weight. This allows the cheese to retain much of its moisture. Designed to be eaten as soon as it is out of the press, Shepherd\u2019s Hope has fresh, light, milky flavors and a semi soft texture.\u00a0 A delicious tang reminds us of the rich complexity of sheep\u2019s milk.\nAppalachian ~ Raw Cow\u2019s Milk ~ Meadow Creek Dairy ~ Galax, VA \u2013 The Meadow Creek Dairy, perched in the misty, cool emerald reaches of the Appalachian Mountains, operates a seasonal Jersey dairy at an elevation of 2,800 feet where the water is pure, the air is bright and clean, and the soils are rich and untainted. This pristine environment nurtures healthy cows which produce pure milk that is free from any synthetic hormones or antibiotics. \u00a0\u00a0Appalachian cheese is a wonderfully rustic square cheese with a craterous exterior; it has a luxuriously supple straw color paste and is speckled with white and fuzzy grey molds with glimpses of pink showing through. The flavor is mild and buttery with a spicy finish and just a hint of mushroom.\nCabot Clothbound Cheddar ~ Pasteurized Cow\u2019s Milk ~ Jasper Hill Farm ~ Greensboro, VT \u2013 Possibly the most buzzed about American Artisan cheese ever, & considered by some to be the \u201cworld\u2019s best cheddar,\u201d one bite of this cheese will surely convince you that all the hype is merited; although not sharp, this cheddar has layer upon layer of flavor including notes of caramel, mustard, grass, hay, cellar, & bouillon, all contained under a bandaged wrap.\u00a0 As its cult following will attest, this cheese may give dope a run for its money as the most addictive cash crop.\u00a0 The cheddar is made from a hand selected herd from the famous Cabot co-op & is then aged under the direction of Mateo Kehler at the cellars at Jasper Hill Farm: a joining of two of the finest cheese talents the Green Mountain State has to offer, it is no wonder this cheese is held in such high esteem\u2026\nBayley Hazen Blue ~ Raw Cow\u2019s Milk ~ Jasper Hill Farm ~ Greensboro, VT \u2013\nIf you are among the ranks that worship stilton as the king of cheese, than look no further than this Vermont variation of the British classic.\u00a0 Bayley Hazen is a natural rinded blue cheese made with whole raw milk every other day, primarily with morning milk, which is lower in fat. Jasper Hill uses the Ayrshire breed of cow whose milk is particularly well suited to the production of blue cheese because of its small fat globules, which are easily broken down during the aging process. The paste of a Bayley Hazen is drier than most blues & the penicillium roqueforti takes a back seat to an array of flavors that hint at nuts, grasses, & chocolate syrup.\u00a0 Though denser & more crumbly than most blues, its texture reminds one of chocolate & butter combined, giving way to a deliciously fudgy result.\nHolly Springs ~ Raw Goat\u2019s Milk ~ Sweet Grass Dairy ~ Thomasville, GA \u2013\nHolly Springs is Sweet Grass Dairy\u2019s aged, raw goat\u2019s milk cheese. Fresh milk from their herd of Saanen, La Mancha and Nubian goats is handcrafted into wheels and aged 2 months. With an ivory paste and a semi-firm texture, Holly Springs has a warm, nutty flavor that lends itself well to a variety of culinary applications. For something truly decadent, grate some for a classic souffl\u00e9 and pair with a glass of the cask-conditioned ale to match the sweet, caramel notes of the cheese.\nAbbaye de Belloc ~ Raw Sheep\u2019s Milk ~ Notre-Dame de Belloc ~ West Pyrenees, France \u2013 This cheese is still made in the traditional manner by Benedictine Monks at the abbey of Notre-Dame de Belloc. A French Pyrenees sheep\u2019s milk cheese, Abbaye has a fine, dense texture & is high in fat. The milk comes from the red-nosed Manech ewes (an old local breed) whose milk is brought into the monastery from neighboring farms. Abbaye de Belloc has a true Basque character, & it is believed that many centuries ago the monks from the Belloc Monastery first taught the Basque shepherds how to make cheese. Proper care will accentuate the subtle lactic, floral, & caramelized flavors that make this cheese so compelling.\nTomme de Chevre ~ Pasteurized Goat\u2019s Milk ~ G.L.A.C. Co-op ~ Charentes-Poitou, France \u2013 This delectable tomme comes from a region famous for its distinctive goat\u2019s milk cheeses; it is aged for a minimum of two months and during this time it is periodically washed with a brine solution, which encourages the growth of the beneficial b. linen bacteria, which in turn is responsible for the supple and dense yet creamy paste.\u00a0 This cheese is subtly fruity, and slightly funky, with a touch of barnyard.\u00a0 An ever popular favorite at the cheese counter, this cheese more often than not has patrons coming back for seconds\u2026\nTomme Crayeuse ~ Pasteurized Cow\u2019s Milk ~ Schmidhauser ~ Haute Savoie, France -You won\u2019t find Tomme Crayeuse (tohm cray-YUHZ) in many reference works on cheese, as it is a relatively new invention. Created about eight years ago by the French affineur (cheese maturer) Max Schmidhauser, working with a cheesemaker, this new tomme is an attempt to make a cheese that resembles Tomme de Savoie but with more personality. I\u2019d say they\u2019ve succeeded.\u00a0\u00a0 Made in France\u2019s Savoie region from pasteurized cow\u2019s milk, with a lovely natural rind that is richly coated with gray and white molds and sometimes the yellow mold that I\u2019ve only seen on cheeses from this region.\u00a0 Inside, you\u2019ll find a dense, semisoft, pale ivory paste. If sufficiently mature, the cheese will be creamy under the rind, with a touch of chalkiness at the heart (crayeuse means chalky in French). The aroma reminds me of mushrooms, earth and damp cellar. On the tongue, the cheese shows pronounced yet pleasing acidity, a characteristic that distinguishes it from the milder Tomme de Savoie.\nPecorino Toscano ~ Heat Treated Sheep\u2019s Milk ~ Tuscany, Italy \u2013\nSheep rearing in Tuscany goes back to Etruscan times. Book XI of Pliny the Elder\u2019s Natural History contains a reference to an already flourishing Pecorino industry in Tuscany. Pliny describes the Pecorino as being made in the area of Luni, present-day Lunigiana, and imported to Rome by merchants.\u00a0 Pecorino Toscano is wonderfully distinctive table cheese.\u00a0 This firm but not dry pecorino is fragrant & savory, with an array of flavors reminiscent of a fine olive oil.\nHarpersfield ~ Raw Cow\u2019s Milk ~ Brovetto Dairy ~ Jefferson, NY \u2013\nHarpersfield is a natural rind cows\u2019 milk, modeled after Tilsit, a famous cheese from Deutschland. It is deliciously yeasty with tangy and lactic notes. Instead of retiring to Florida like most of their New York brethren, the Brovetto family began making cheese in 2001, after Corinne and Ronald finished up with their first careers. Harpersfield is creamy & smooth. Lightly sharp with a hint of butterfat\u2026the perfect chunk of cheese to down with a good cold beer.\nBerne ~ORGANIC Raw Cow\u2019s Milk ~ Pasture Land Co-op ~ Goodhue, MN \u2013\nBerne is lightly washed with Riesling wine and caraway yielding a complex and intensely funky cheese. \u00a0Berne is full flavored with herbal notes and hints of apple and grass.

The event runs from 4:00 \u2013 7:00 so feel free to drop in & out at your leisure, or to stay for the full three hours!\nBELGIAN BEERS TO BE TASTED:\nArtisanal Imports:\nPauwel Kwak \u2013 Kwak is rich amber in color with a slightly sweet, generously malty character. Hops are subdued, but present a well-considered balance with the juicy ripeness of grain and a fruity, meringue softness. 8.0% ABV\nSt-Feuillien Saison \u2013 St. Feuillien\u2019s Saison is what the Belgians call a beer of the terroir, a traditional farmhouse ale with all the rich savor of the fertile land of southern Belgium. Saison, a warm golden blonde ale , is a top fermented classique. Thanks to secondary fermentation in the bottle, Saison has an unmistakable flavor full of nuances and a slight tang.\u00a0 6.5% ABV\nTripel Karmeliet \u2013 Brewed with oats, barley and wheat, Tripel Karmeliet has soft, full, rich grain character with hints of banana, vanilla, and a slight, pleasing bubble-gum aroma. A restrained hop bitterness offers perfect balance and a gentle counterpart to its substantial maltiness. 8.0% ABV\nBockor Omer \u2013 Pale golden and extraordinary, Omer has a firm malt character with a pleasant hop bitterness and warm, bready aroma. Tasted in it\u2019s signature glass it\u2019s a treat for the eye and palate. 8.0% ABV\nB. United Imports:\nDulle Teve \u2013 Brewed in the tradition of a Belgian Triple. Its high density stems from large amounts of pale malt increased with pale candy sugar in the brew kettle. It is unfiltered and unpasteurized with a bittering of about 30 IBU due to the Goldings hops in the brew kettle. The original De Dulle Teve, meaning \u2018Mad Bitch\u2019 was a one time brew and had been forgotten until a couple of years ago when the de Dolle Brewers thought that making a good triple would not be a bad idea. 10% ABV\nSmisje Dubbel \u2013 Johan Brandt , with a passion for excellent good beer, started this tiny artisanal brewery end of 1995. In the beginning he brewed only once a week with a capacity of 120 liters (1 barrel). By 1999 he started brewing twice a week with an increased capacity of 160 liters (1.5 barrels), meaning non stop brewing, bottling, washing bottles throughout the year. He is now looking for a bigger brewery where he can brew 700 liters (6 barrels) at a time and fill the bottles automatically. Johan Brandt, also a bee-keeper, started out with only one type of beer, a honey beer called \u2018t Smisje. He now produces 6 permanent beers including this Dubble spiced with Honey, Fresh Real Dates, Dark and Light Candy Sugar.\nDe Dolle Boskeun \u2013 Boskeun is the nickname of Jo, one of the two brothers who started the brewery. As a home brewer, some of his favorite beer to produce were strong blond ales. The word Boskeun means \u201crabbit\u201d, or \u201chare\u201d, so they decided to brew one of his favorite types of beer as a celebration of Easter. It has been brewed with pale malt, Golding hops, cane sugar and re-fermented with native honey. 10% ABV\nPicobrouwerij Alvinne Wild Undressed \u2013 Wild Undressed is very nice lactic acid, mellow and yet clear sour,aged inn Monbazillac wine barrels. Monbazillac is a French sweet wine with notes of honey, vanilla, apricot, orange. 5.5 ABV\nGlobal Imports:\nTroubadour Obscura - Dark in color, as you would expect from a stout.\u00a0 Slightly more red-brown, though, when compared with Irish stouts. A dense rich creamy beige head crowns your glass. The flavors are deeper, richer, more pronounced: malty, clearly roasted (is it hints of coffee, is it hints of chocolate?) Deceptive, because the relatively high alcohol content is not immediately felt, except maybe a slight glowing sensation.\u00a0 A complex aftertaste, with some licorice undertones, and a pleasant bitterness survives last. 8.5% ABV\nPetrus Oud Bruin Ale \u2013 Dark ruby red, as red wine. The style is also called the Burgundy of Flanders, and is a very typical and common beer in West Flanders. A sour-sweet balance is discovered, set off by the underlying bitterness of the hops. Light in alcohol, the alcohol doesn\u2019t hide or overpower the exciting flavors and tastes in this unique beer.\nWooden flavors? Indeed, Old Brown beer is aged for over two years in huge oak casks. During this aging process, just like in wine, lactic acids develop. These acids are responsible for the sour part in the taste. 5.5% ABV\nPoperings Hommel \u2013 This beer is a one of a kind ale, that you can best classify with the other Strong Golden Ales from Belgium. What makes it special is of course the yeast, and what makes it unique is the higher amounts of hops used. This beer has about twice the bitterness of other Belgian beers. Poperings Hommel ale is brewed with a blend of summer, winter and aromatic pale malts. The brewery has its own well where soft water is found, and only local grown hops from the Gold and Hallertau family all of this gives Hommel a roselike floweriness, honeyish notes, orange-zest hop flavors and a late spicy, and a cuminseed dryness. 7.5% ABV\nBruges Zot Blond Unfiltered \u2013 The only beer that is actually brewed and lagered in Brugge (Bruges), the fierce medieval town in Flanders, the Venice of the North.\u00a0 Pale blond ale, crowned with a white head, blooms with a fruity pronounced aroma, hints of lemon, and hits the palate with a refreshing dryness, embellished by hints of spices and orange, balanced by an underlying faint malty sweetness. The beer finishes with a short, fruity taste that somewhat sticks to the palate. The unfiltered version is only available at the Brewery\u2019s Pub in\u00a0Brugge has been released to the US for the first time!! 6% ABV\nMerchant du Vin Imports:\nOrval \u2013 Sunset-orange color; a fruity and slightly acidic bouquet, firm body, profound hop bitterness, and long, dry finish. Orval is bottled with Brettanomyces, a yeast strain that leads to superb dry complexity and ageworthiness. 6.9% ABV\nRochefort 10 \u2013 Dark brown color. Great strength balanced by a complexity of flavors and firm malt backbone. The bouquet covers a wide range: port wine, leather, apricots, oak, spices \u2013 a deeply intriguing beverage. 11.3% ABV\nWestmalle Dubbel \u2013 A dark, reddish-brown Trappist beer with a secondary fermentation in the bottle. The creamy head has the fragrance of special malt and leaves an attractive lace pattern in the glass. The flavour is rich and complex, herby and fruity with a fresh-bitter finish. It is a balanced quality beer with a soft feel in the mouth and a long, dry aftertaste. 7% ABV\nWestmalle Triple \u2013 A clear, golden yellow Trappist beer that undergoes a secondary fermentation in the bottle. It is a complex beer with a fruity aroma and a nice nuanced hop scent. It is soft and creamy in the mouth, with a bitter touch carried by the fruity aroma. An exceptional beer, with a great deal of finesse and elegance, with a splendid long aftertaste. 9.5% ABV\nVanberg & Dewulf Imports:\nSaison Dupont \u2013 A world classic beer and the yardstick for one of Belgium\u2019s most important beer styles. It is the most admired and imitated Saison in the world. Saison Dupont is a wonderful straw color with a dense creamy head. The nose is alive, like fresh raised bread, estery with citrus and spice notes. Full-bodied and malty, it sparkles on the palate and finishes with a zesty hop and citrus attack. Incredibly compatible with food! 6.5 ABV\nBrouwerij De Troch Lambrucha \u2013 The mystic marriage of two fermented drinks: lambic and kombucha. The first time two different types of live yeast drinks (lambic and Kombucha fermented tea) have been blended together to create a completely new, live yeast beverage. Lambrucha\u2122 is the brainchild of Don Feinberg, with technical assistance from Dr. Roger Mussche, one of the world\u2019s leading authorities on Brettanomyces yeast. A deliciously tart effervescent beverage is created by pitching yeast into tea and letting it ferment. Kombucha is renowned for its probiotic, health-giving benefits. Lambic is the justly revered spontaneously fermenting beer from the Senne River Valley in Belgium. Lambic contains some 500 different yeasts and is the oldest continuously brewed style of beer in the world. 3.5 ABV\nScheldebrouwerij Hopruiter \u2013 This strong golden ale combines Belgian appreciation for aromatic esters with the American love of hops. But unlike American IPA\u2019s and Belgian IPA wannabes, Hop Ruiter celebrates the finesse Belgians bring to using hops. Three different varieties (none American) are used; one in the boil and two in dry hopping. The combination of type and technique gives Hop Ruiter a tannic, almost oaky hop acidity reminiscent of good white wines. If you\u2019re expecting American piney, resiny hops that fur your tongue, Hop Ruiter will disappoint. But if you want to enjoy noble hop aroma and fine bitterness that perfectly marries with malt sweetness to make an exceptionally smooth, full-flavored beer, Hop Ruiter will delight. 8% ABV\nScaldis Peche Mel - What do you get when you brew a slightly lighter version of classic Scaldis and add peach juice? A deliciously drinkable beer with the heady aroma of peach, a well balanced malt character, and a surprisingly dry finish. Based on a favorite drink made by students that combined peach lambic and classic Scaldis, Peche Mel redefines what a beer with fruit can taste like! 8.5 ABV\nCHEESES TO BE TASTED INCLUDE:\nGreen Fields ~ Raw Cow\u2019s Milk ~ Saxon Homestead Creamery ~ Cleveland, WI \u2013 Green Fields is an earthy, elegant table cheese which draws inspiration from the classic monastery cheeses. Its sweet, nutty tones vary with the seasons.

But Hodgson makes a couple of errors worth pointing out, so I thought I\u2019d add my two cents.\nHodgson begins well enough:\n\u201cPicture a peaceful, Amish farmer, selling one of nature\u2019s super foods \u2014 fresh, raw milk. Eager customers came from afar, even across state lines, to savor the taste and access a nutritious product. Who could oppose such harmonious commerce on Rainbow Acres Farm?\u00a0Government officials and their enforcers, that\u2019s who.\nThis Pennsylvania farmer has been the subject of a yearlong sting operation, which included stealth purchases and a 5 a.m. surprise inspection. In February, a federal judge imposed a permanent injunction that prohibited him from selling his milk across state lines.\u201d\nSo far, so good. But then Hodgson makes an error of over-simplification: \u201cTo defend this violation of freedom of choice, proponents claim to be protecting others from the purported dangers of raw milk. But this claim is laughable, since evidence to the contrary has been mounting for decades.\u201d\nAs I\u2019ve written on\u00a0occasion, the health risks associated with raw milk consumption are generally quite low, at least for adults with a healthy immune system. But they\u2019re not zero.\u00a0After all, pasteurization was seen as a remarkable scientific breakthrough and public health miracle for a reason: raw milk can harbor any number of nasty bacteria \u2013 including S. typhimurium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, Campylobacter, and Brucella \u2013 which historically have had a nasty tendency to result in illness and,\u00a0occasionally, death.\nAdmittedly, compared with lots of other, far larger risks that we humans live with on a daily basis, you\u2019d certainly think that public health officials would have more pressing issues to deal with. But here\u2019s where Hodgson lets his enthusiasm get the better of him. He writes: \u201c[A]\u00a0recent federal report (PDF) from the Centers for Disease Control did not find a single death from the product in a 14-year research period, while three individuals died on account of pasteurized milk. \u2026\u00a0That\u2019s because raw milk is a safe product.\u201d\nThe problem is, the CDC report Hodgson links to flatly contradicts his claims. \u201cWe found 121 outbreaks for which the product\u2019s pasteurization status was known; among these, 73 (60%) involved nonpasteurized products and resulted in 1,571 cases, 202 hospitalizations, and 2 deaths.\u201d Now, it\u2019s important to note that all of the deaths attributed to foodborne disease outbreaks associated with dairy products involved cheeses, not fluid milk. But, according to the report, two of the deaths were caused by unpasteurized products and only one by a pasteurized product. (My best guess is that Hodgson mis-read the table at the bottom of page 387 to arrive at his conclusion that 3 deaths were caused by pasteurized products.)\nHodgson\u2019s bigger point, that the risks associated with unpasteurized milk are tiny and we shouldn\u2019t stand idly by while the government tramples our rights in order to protect us from ourselves, is of course true \u2014 which is why I still recommend the article. But I have very little sympathy for people who wish to perpetuate the myth that raw milk is perfectly safe and/or somehow better for us than pasteurized milk.\nNow, lest I be misunderstood, let me be clear: \u00a0I do believe that consenting adults should be free to sell, buy, and/or consume raw milk. But the outrage here is not that our government is cracking down on a perfectly benign activity; it\u2019s that our fellow citizens have empowered government to interfere with our ability to make our own choices when they raise any risk at all. The crackdown on raw milk is merely one symptom of a much larger problem.\nIf you enjoyed this article, please consider sharing it!\nTwitter\n"}, {"score": 402.03262, "uuid": "4a3dbd71-ceb0-5552-98c9-dea77190cf50", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0006wb-89-20446", "target_hostname": "oldfraser.lexi.net", "target_uri": "http://oldfraser.lexi.net/publications/onbalance/1996/9-5/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "On Balance - Vol 9, Num 5", "snippet": "Naturally, with modern technology certain bacteria may be detected <em>better</em> <em>than</em> in the past.&quot;", "explanation": null, "document": "CHEESE, POLITICS, AND HUMAN HEALTH:\nHow the Media Failed to Critique Recent Government Policy\nTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RECENTLY PROPOSED an amendment to the Food and Drug Regulations that would ban the production and sale of raw-milk cheese. Citing evidence that links unpasteurized cheese with outbreaks of listeria, salmonella, and e. coli, new regulations would require that cheese be produced from pasteurized or heat-treated milk.\nGovernment regulations are a rapidly burgeoning field. In efforts to ensure the health and safety of Canadians, defend consumers' rights, and protect the environment, successive federal and provincial governments have passed in excess of 100,000 regulations over the past two decades. [Fazil Mihlar, work in progress, The Fraser Institute; Economic Council of Canada, Responsible Regulation: An Interim Report, Ottawa: Supply and Services Canada, 1979, pp. 14-18; the Privy Council Office.]\nIn this context, one more regulation, this time outlawing the 90 odd varieties of raw-milk cheeses such as certain camemberts and roqueforts, may seem insignificant. But upon closer reflection, this latest proposal is illustrative of media's inability to describe the complex interactions between consumers, government, and business which can, and often does, impinge on the lives of all Canadians.\nFor example, did the media reports examine the consumers' right to choice? Legislation such as this current proposal suggests that Canadians are incapable of understanding and assessing risks, and that an appropriate role for government is akin to that of a parental authority, determining what is and what is not to be served for dinner. Further, even if the risks posed by raw-milk cheese warrant intervention, will the proposed regulations have the desired effect? Or are there alternative uses for taxpayers' money which would ultimately have a greater impact on the health of Canadians?\nThis issue of On Balance will examine these issues in light of recent media attention, and lack of attention, to the proposed amendment of the regulations governing cheese production and the science which supports the vast array of regulation presently in place.\nCBC goes soft on cheese controversy\nOn the April 16, 1996 CBC \"The National,\" Peter Mansbridge began a report on the proposed regulatory amendment with the words: \"Ottawa is getting choosy about the cheese that Canadians eat. Experts at Health Canada want to ban it if it's made from unpasteurized milk. They're worried about the bac-\nteria in raw-milk cheese. As the CBC's Brenda Craig reports, they believe the bacteria can be hazardous to your health.\"\nFigure A shows the CBC, CTV, and Globe and Mail coverage of the proposed cheese regulations from April 15 to April 18, 1996. Both networks and the newspaper reports focused their attention on the question of risk: does the consumption of raw-milk cheese pose a meaningful risk to human health?\nOn CBC, the message was a resounding \"yes\"-the public is at risk and further government intervention is a positive development (see figure B). Over 70 percent of CBC's analysis of the risks posed by raw-milk cheese echoed the government line.\nOn CBC's \"Midday\" Brent Bambury interviewed nutrition columnist Fran Berkoff. Bambury asked: \"Have there been any instances, Fran, of people falling quite ill to disease caused by cheese made with raw, unpasteurized milk?\"\nBerkoff's response: \"There have been reported outbreaks. Not a lot. In looking this over there's actually been cases in France where people have gotten very sick from eating raw cheese and raw-milk cheese and isolated instances where it happened.\" When asked if one should discard that \"delicious wheel\" of raw-milk cheese, Berkoff stated: \"I would continue eating it. The likelihood is it's O.K.\"\nAlthough a number of Berkoff's statements seemed to indicate her doubt as to whether these new stricter regulations are really required, she was openly supportive of the government: \"All that really happened is that they're [the government] trying to make our cheese a little bit safer.\"\nCTV questions the need for new regulations\nIn contrast, CTV provided more statements that questioned the risk posed by raw-milk cheese than opinions that supported the government's position that unpasteurized cheese should be banned. Fifty-six percent of CTV's coverage indicated that raw-milk cheese did not pose a health hazard, and that the present regulations sufficiently protected the Canadian public.\nThe Globe and Mail takes the middle ground\nThe Globe and Mail provided the most equitable coverage of the risks associated with raw-milk cheese. Forty-seven percent of assessments agreed that unpasteurized cheese posed a risk, 39 percent of the coverage indicated that raw-milk cheese was safe and 14 percent questioned the severity of the risk.\nFor example, in a front-page article on April 16, 1996, \"Parmesan Proposal Raises a Stink\", the Globe quoted Canadian Labour Minister Alfonso Gagliano: \"We have been eating parmesan for hundreds of years . . . . Naturally, with modern technology certain bacteria may be detected better than in the past.\"\nIn a background piece, \"More than a matter of taste, officials say,\" published April 18, 1996, Globe reporter John Allemang provided this summation: \"It is a classic New World versus Old World battle, with the forces of health and hygiene in league against those who think a sublime, if somewhat stinky, food is worth a little risk.\nCTV captures Quebec, consumer, and industry reactions\nAnother significant difference in the media reports was the amount of coverage devoted to the impact of the proposed regulation on various interest groups. Public reaction, including consumers, the Parti Quebecois, and various industry representatives, accounted for 6 percent of CBC, 41 percent of CTV and 25 percent of the Globe and Mail total coverage of the proposed amendment.\nCTV broke the story nationally on April 15, 1996, focusing on how the issue was playing out in Quebec and the concerns of consumers. Lloyd Robertson began the report that evening: \"Canadians may soon have trouble buying some of their favourite imported specialty cheeses. Health Canada is proposing tougher regulations for cheeses like parmesan and brie because they're made with raw or unpasteurized milk. Although officials cite health reasons, consumers aren't buying their concerns.\"\nGlobe examines Quebec's position\nThe Globe and Mail provided the most detailed coverage of Quebec's position and the concerns of the raw-milk cheese producers. On April 16, 1996, Anne McIlroy's report began: \"Distinctive smells-not distinct society-had the Bloc Quebecois twitching their political whiskers yesterday. The news that new federal health regulations may ban imported parmesan and other strong-smelling unpasteurized cheeses in Canada has caused consternation in Quebec and put cheese on the parliamentary menu.\"\nAccording to Agriculture Canada, the production and consumption of raw-milk cheeses occurs principally in Quebec. It is a \"developing niche market\" which was virtually non-existent five years ago and today produces 50,000 to 65,000 kilograms of raw-milk cheese per year. The total market value of raw-milk cheese is estimated to be between $6.2 and $9.3 million annually.\nHealth Canada examined the potential costs of the regulatory changes and concluded that costs to producers would be \"limited\" as most would already own the pasteurizing and labelling equipment required to meet the amendment. This contradicts the profile provided by Agriculture Canada in which enterprises involved in the production of raw-milk cheese are described as \"small,\" with 2 establishments producing only raw-milk cheeses.\nCBC, CTV, and the Globe and Mail gave limited coverage to the impact of the regulatory proposal on the developing industry. On April 15, 1996, \"CTV News\" quoted cheese retailer Irvin MacArthur: \"We see an increase of between 10 and 15 percent demand in raw-milk products each year and this is completely due to the emphasis we've been putting on raw-milk products because they are safe.\"\nOn April 16, 1996 CBC's \"The National\" reporter Brenda Craig stated: \"In Quebec, where there is a growing industry and demand for flavourful soft cheeses like raw-milk brie and camembert, consumers and merchants are outraged.\"\nThe Globe and Mail article published April 18, 1996, \"Dingwall Accepts Dietary Dare,\" reported: \"There is also a fledgling unpasteurized cheese industry in that province that would crumble under the new rules.\" On the same day, in the article \"More than a matter of taste, officials say,\" the Globe was the only one of the three media examined to present the concerns of the National Dairy Council and the Dairy Farmers of Canada: \"Canada's dairy producers see their reputation tied to the image of milk as a clean and healthy product. Any outbreak of cheese borne disease would compromise that reputation just as surely as a few cases of mad cow disease has tainted the entire British beef industry.\"\nMedia's contribution to the politics of risk\nFear of a consumer backlash, brought on by an outbreak of salmonella, listeria, or e. coli, and subsequently magnified by the propensity of the press who value dramatic flair above education, is arguably the primary impetus for the recent regulatory proposal.\nIn the Cato Institute publication, \"Science Without Sense,\" Steven Milloy examined the characteristics that ensure mass publicity for studies which examine various risks to human health. The criteria are: (1) the risk should be unprovable, (2) the risk should be ubiquitous, (3) the risk should be intuitive to the public, (4) a good risk cannot be defended easily, (5) risks should be involuntary, (6) reducing or eliminating the risk should involve no perceptible personal sacrifice, and (7) pick on the unsuspecting. [Steven Milloy (1995), Science Without Sense: The Risky Business of Public Health Research, Cato Institute, Washington D.C., pp. 5-9.]\nMilloy's book is not intended as a media study, but these seven attributes are a very apt description of the studies which frequent our airwaves and newspaper headlines. In 1993, the National Media Archive examined five years of television reports regarding the causes of cancer. [\"Cancer and Health: TV Attention to the Environmental Causes of Cancer,\" On Balance, Volume 6, Number 7, 1993.]\nWe found that environmental factors (pesticides, man-made chemicals, man-made radiation, asbestos, ozone depletion, magnetic fields and general pollution) accounted for 68 percent of CBC's and 54 percent of CTV's total attention to the causes of cancer. These are all factors that are difficult to prove, apply to a broad segment of the population, are easy to relate to, and, perhaps most importantly, are involuntary.\nThese reports dominated the coverage regardless of the fact that environmental factors have been found to be insignificant in comparison to the personal decisions one makes with regards to health. Dr. Bruce Ames, a molecular biologist at the University of California, maintains that \"cancer is fundamentally a degenerative disease of old age, although external factors can increase cancer rates (cigarette smoking) or decrease them (fruits and vegetables).\" [Bruce N. Ames (1993), \"The Topic of Cancer-Sierra Magazine vs. Bruce Ames,\" The American Spectator, June, p. 38.]\nThe predominant causes of cancer are diet, tobacco, alcohol, and sun tanning-all activities within the control of the individual. However, these factors constituted only 15 percent of CBC's and 25 percent of CTV's coverage of cancer-causing agents and activities.\nThe media's propensity to report studies which meet the characteristics outlined in Milloy's book, at the expense of studies which may be mundane but add to scientific knowledge, has rendered much of science impotent to affect public policy. Instead of focusing public attention on real science, the media bombards its audiences with one crisis after another-the most recent being the tale of the mad cows.\nGovernments inability to prioritize risk\nThe scientists at the Microbial Hazards Bureau of Health Canada who provided the evidence to support the proposed amendment to ban unpasteurized cheese spend their days carefully examining case studies and performing experiments. They are motivated by the desire to create a safer world; yet, even in their literature, reference is made to the economic benefits to be accrued by tightening the regulations. For example, one study concludes: \"Recent outbreaks of salmonellosis have shed new light on the importance of cheese as a vehicle of human infection. . . . The growing problem of bacterial pathogens in fluid milk and milk products must be confronted if its potential impact on human health and on the economic viability of sectors in the food industry is to be minimized.\" [Journal of Food Protection, Vol. 48, No. 12 (December 1985), p. 1065.]\nSince 1971, 14 outbreaks of diseases believed to have been caused by the consumption of raw-milk cheeses have been reported worldwide. These outbreaks resulted in 4,228 illnesses and 57 deaths. [Dr. J.-Y. D'Aoust, work in progress, Bureau of Microbial Hazards, Health Canada, 1996.]While any actions taken to improve human health are laudable, interventions cannot be considered in isolation.\nThe field that deals with this public policy issue is risk analysis-the dollars and cents of saving human lives. Risk analysis not usually popular among either government or the media-we are led to believe that life is priceless, and any words to the contrary are only uttered by the truly cold and heartless. Unfortunately, the resources which can be allocated to the establishment and enforcement of regulations, however well-intentioned, are limited, and should therefore be distributed in a manner that results in the maximum benefit in terms of lives saved and enhancements to the quality of life.\nThe Harvard Center for Risk Analysis has extensively studied U.S. regulations and their impact on the health of Americans. Tammy O. Tengs and John D. Graham examined 185 life-saving interventions, which they define as a \"behavioral and/or technological strategy that reduces the probability of premature death among a specified target population,\" and concluded that there was little attempt to prioritize these regulations.\nTo illustrate their point, Tengs and Graham compared the money spent regulating fire retardant clothing with the cost of smoke detectors. \"We regulate the flammability of children's clothing, spending $1.5 million per year of life saved, while some 30 percent of those children live in homes without smoke alarms, an investment that costs about $200,000 per year of life saved.\"\nThe study found that in the U.S. the total cost of intervention was $21.4 billion annually. This represented 56,700 lives saved per year, at a cost of $376,000 per life. Tengs and Graham estimated that if resources were reallocated, targeting interventions which produced maximum benefits, a total of 117,000 lives could be saved per year for the same amount of money.\nThe \"Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement,\" published in Part I, Canada Gazette, March 30, 1996, provides a terse examination of the costs and benefits associated with the amendment of the Food and Drug Regulations: \"It is anticipated that promulgation of this amendment will enhance the level of protection for Canadian consumers with concomitant economic and health benefits.\"\nThis proposed amendment is a minute component in the realm of regulation presently in place in Canada. However, given the current concern about the cost of government and the burden to taxpayers, the costs and benefits of further regulations are an important aspect of the story, but one which was not examined by the CBC, CTV or Globe and Mail reports.\nMethodology\nThe reports examined in this study were CBC \"The National,\" April 16, 1996; CBC \"Midday,\" April 18, 1996; \"CTV News,\" April 16 and 17, 1996; and the Globe and Mail from April 16 to April 18, 1996. Further information or details on the coding design and methods may be obtained by contacting the National Media Archive.\nRejecting A Merger\nEVER SINCE THE 1993 FEDERAL ELECTION campaign, where the Conservative Party was reduced to two seats in the House of Commons, speculation and discussion of a possible merger between the two parties on the right of the political spectrum have been bandied about. The most recent talk of such a merger came after the recent by-elections in March of this year. For example, CTV's Craig Oliver noted on March 25: \"Well, the battle for second place was important tonight, and Reform won that. It seems to solidify their claim to be the national alternative to the Conservative party and it will add fuel to the fire of those in the Conservative Party, and in the Reform in particular, who want to see some kind of an alliance among the opposition parties.\" CBC also brought up the possible merger in its story, only to refute it. Jason Moscovitz said: \"In the aftermath of the by-elections, the Reform party and the Conservative party are dismissing all talk of merger with more vigour than ever before.\"\nApart from repeating the denials from the respective parties, the coverage both on CBC television news and in newspaper and magazine editorials bordered on sentimental support for the conservative party. The tenor of this argument was contradictory to say the least considering that the Conservatives not only had a dismal showing in 1993 but also lost ground in the recent by-elections. The sense from the media is that the Conservatives have more public support than do the Reform. For example, in the February 4, 1996 \"Sunday Report\" panel, Globe and Mail columnist Jeffrey Simpson made this claim: \"It's rather ironic that Mr. Charest-it's true what Jason said-can't be heard or seen in the House of Commons, and yet I don't want to harp much on polls, they have their limitations; I simply note that a variety of polls taken in the last few months nationally, have shown the Conservative party at worst running even with Reform, and in some cases running better. So this has to be of some concern, I should think, to the Reform party. Here they have all these members in the House of Commons, they have ample opportunity to speak, the media seek their views all the time, and yet they don't seem to be going anywhere, in terms of public esteem, whereas the Conservatives, whose leader, as Jason just said, is neither seen nor heard, seems to be pipping them in the polls.\" Nonetheless, in the polls that count, Reform did beat the Conservatives.\nIn contrast, CTV has been covering the story with more favourable attention to the Reform than to the Conservatives. Roger Smith in his March 26 story on the possibility of a merger made this observation: \"With a deal unlikely, the stage is set for another battle with the grass roots right, a battle that could knock out the Tories if they lose as badly as last time.\" In contrast, CBC placed its emphasis on Reform on April 9, which Sasa Petricic portrayed as threatening: \"The memo also has a threat aimed directly at provincial Conservatives. If any Tory members of any provincial legislature dare to back the federal party, as some in Ontario did during the by-elections, they may pay for it. Reform threatens to run a candidate against them in the next provincial election.\" CTV did not report on this memo in its April 9 newscast.\nNotwithstanding the above-mentioned differences, the networks have stayed relatively neutral on this question. In contrast, columnists have supported the Conservative Party. For example, Peter C. Newman in the April 22, 1996 issue of Maclean's magazine portrayed the story as Preston Manning trying to take over the Conservative Party: \"There isn't a snowball's chance in hell that Preston Manning can realize his dream of taking over the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and marching to victory in the 1997 general election.\" That was about the nicest thing Newman had to say about the Reform party in that column. Among other things, he wrote, \"Manning's Reform party has attracted some of the looniest fruitcakes ever to emerge from the political swamps.\"\nAlthough the networks did not include such colourful language in their reports, the stories did contain an underlying theme: Reform is on the periphery, and the Conservatives are mainstream. That view was presented because both networks quoted Jean Charest. For example, on March 26, CTV's Roger Smith said: \"But Jean Charest insists Reform is too extreme to be a national alternative, and neither party is talking about a formal merger.\" Similarly, on April 11, CBC's \"National\" provided this clip of Charest: \"We don't represent the extremist views of Preston Manning and the Reform party. We're not into whipping; we don't believe in impeachment of a prime minister by a non-elected governor general; saying one thing and cynically acting in a different way.\"\nWhat seemed peculiar about the coverage was the negative attention given to Reform and the neutral coverage of the Tories. On a purely superficial level, one would expect that both parties would be given an equal number of positive and negative assessments. Or at best, they would be treated neutrally. At worst, one would expect, given their political fortunes, that the Conservatives would be criticized, not the Reform party.\nIf you know someone who would be interested in this web page, please enter their email address below, and we will forward this URL to them:\nEmail Address:\ninfo@fraserinstitute.ca\nYou can contact us at the above email address for any comments or information requests.

Is dried cheese also and what about freeze dried cheese and milk?\nA. Carcinogens are always formed in the process of spray drying. I don't know about freeze drying, but I would suggest sticking to real, unprocessed cheese.\nQ. I am considering switching my family to raw milk. However, I have only one remaining concern, I have been reading about the bovine leukemia virus that is transmitted through raw milk and there have been breast cancer studies that have found it in tissue. I'm also finding on nomilk.com that dairy farmers who drink raw milk have higher rates of leukemia. Will you comment on this?\nA. Please show me this website where they say that drinkers of raw milk have more leukemia. This is a completely unsupported statement! There have been no studies of drinkers of raw milk in the US for over 60 years. Milk from pastured cows is perfectly safe to drink. These cows do not have leukemia. But I would not drink raw milk from confinement cows.\nQ. I have just found a source for raw cow's milk, who would I contact to find out what to look for and what questions to ask to know if the cow is clean and a good milk source?\nA. Here are some summary guidelines. The last one is not really necessary if all the others are followed.\nCows graze on unsprayed pasture except during the coldest time of the year and then are fed mostly hay and silage when in barns.\nThe herd is tested free of TB and brucellosis.\nWhen a milking machine is used, the cow's teats are washed with iodine before putting the milking caps on.\nThe milking shed and surrounds are clean and tidy.\nMilk is kept chilled in a stainless steel tank or individual containers.\nMilk is tested regularly to ensure the absence of human pathogens.\nQ. Do you have information showing the nutritional value of raw milk vs pasteurized?\nA. The closest thing we have to an article on the nutritional composition of raw milk is the powerpoint presentation on raw milk on the splash page of realmilk.com.\nThe problem is that when you do an analysis for vitamins and minerals, raw milk does not look that different from pasteurized. But what is destroyed is the carrier proteins, which are destroyed by pasteurization. But the tests don't look for this.\nQ. Is there growth hormone in milk?\nA. All cow milk contains growth hormones, which are identical to human growth hormones. These are being sold as a health food and are considered beneficial in the health food industry.\nQ. My acne seemed to get better when I stopped drinking skim milk.\nA. Skim milk could cause acne for several reasons, notably because it depletes vitamin A and also because, if it is pasteurized, the body mounts an immune response to it. Raw whole milk often clears up acne.\nQ. I would like to have information on the safety and value of raw cheese.\nA. There is a book called, American Farmstead Cheese, The Complete Guide to Making and Selling Artisan Cheeses, by Paul Kindstedt (with the Vermont Cheese Council). It has a chapter about raw milk cheese safety, although no recipes. It's a pretty interesting book. I would contact him directly at the University of Vermont, Dept of Nutrition and Food Sciences.\nQ. I was recently advised not to drink milk because of the possibility of it causing Lyme Disease. Please comment.\nA. This is just one more slur against raw milk. Raw milk contains components that kill all pathogens. One body of opinion believes that Lyme is caused by pesticides, not a virus. One of our members, Dr. Ron Schmid, cured himself of Lyme disease by drinking lots of raw milk.\nQ: What does pasteurization do to the fat in cream?\nA: Pasteurization is much more damaging to the proteins than the fats. The only thing ruined in the fats will be the Wulzen Factor, which protects against arthritis. If only pasteurized cream is available, you can get the Wulzen Factor by taking high-vitamin butter oil.\nQ: In your Real Milk brochure you mention German hospitals using raw milk, what are they doing?\nA: In many hospitals they just give raw milk as part of the diet. They may also be using the milk fast, described here: http://realmilk.com/milkcure.html\nQ:Is it lawful to purchase raw milk for personal use and take it across a state line?\nThere is a federal regulation prohibiting raw milk for human consumption in interstate commerce.\u00a0 According to an FDA official, the agency's position is that it is illegal to purchase raw milk for personal use and carry it across state lines.\u00a0 Having said that, I can tell you the FDA has never taken any action against a consumer who has done this.\u00a0 I would not let the FDA's position dissuade you from obtaining foods that you believe are healthy for your family.\u00a0 I believe that the regulation is unconstitutional.\u00a0 The FTCLDF (ftcldf.org) is currently representing an Indiana farmer that is challenging their ruling.\nQ: Which whey is better to use for fermenting vegetables and fruits, the whey obtained from raw goat milk cream cheese or the whey obtained from a 24-hour (heated goat milk) yogurt goat milk is the only milk I use?\u00a0 I find the whey from the cheese culture mild, almost sweet tasting compared to the whey from the yogurt culture which is sharper, more lemony tasting.\u00a0 Since I\u2019ve been making the cream cheese more often than the yogurt, I have more of the cheese whey on hand however, I wouldn\u2019t want my recipes to spoil on me.\nWhey from sour milk, yogurt or cream cheese are all fine.\u00a0 But best not to use the whey from other cheeses--this whey has undergone an additional fermentation and I don't know what the results will be\u00a0 We have found that using cheese whey for the baby formula causes it to curdle.\nQ: I used the recipe below to make whey using raw milk.\u00a0 However after 4 days I strained it and I don't think it had separated enough, because I only got about 1/2 cup of cream cheese and the whey looks pretty thick.\u00a0 It does smell sour.\u00a0 I was wondering if I should let it sit out longer?\nA: Yes, you should let it sit out longer.\u00a0 It might help if you added a spoonful of yoghurt to the milk, it might separate more quickly.\nQ: To separate milk, do I need to open the milk bottle in the first place, or can I take a sealed and un-opened bottle of milk and place it on the counter to separate?\nA: You may let it separate in the bottle if the milk is in glass bottles but the problem with letting the milk separate in a milk bottle is the small opening at the top--it is very difficult to pour out.\u00a0 Also, I think it would take much longer if you had not first exposed the milk to air.\nQ: Can you tell me about the raw milk diet and specifically an article by J.W. Crew?\u00a0 Also, is the raw milk diet helpful for alcoholics?\nA: The only reference I have for this is the original article by JW Crewe, which we have posted at _ http://realmilk.com/milkcure.html _\nSince raw milk is an excellent source of vitamin B6, that alone would make it helpful for alcoholism.\u00a0 Also, since on the raw milk diet, one gets off all grains, this would also make this diet helpful.\nQ: If I skim cream off raw milk, is the remaining milk considered skim?\u00a0 Is that okay to drink and will it make him fat?\nA: If you skim the cream off the milk, it is \"skimmed\" milk.\u00a0 It is probably the equivalent of about 1% milk.\u00a0 If you use the cream and also drink this skimmed milk, this is fine.\u00a0 But if you just drink the skimmed milk without consuming additional butterfat from butter or cream, you might develop nutrient deficiencies and even have weight gain.\nQ.\u00a0 Why do you not recommend aseptically packed rice milks?\nA.\u00a0 Because they are highly processed and contain emulsifiers, synthetic vitamin D (toxic), sweeteners.\nQ. In Arizona, I can only get raw milk from one source and since there is little grass here, the cows are fed:\u00a0 50% organic alfalfa, 50% organic tritical hay and oats, probiotics in the water and hay, and Redmond sea salt, bentonite clay and kelp for minerals.\nI wonder if these cows contain many of the benefits bestowed in grass-fed milk?\nA.\u00a0 This is a good question!\u00a0 My reply is that I would still recommend this milk and here's why:\u00a0 When my children were little, my only source of raw milk was Alta Dena Dairy in California--this was a large confinement dairy and the feeding program was probably not as good as the one you describe. Yet my children thrived on this milk--it is still way, way better than pasteurized milk.\u00a0 And fortunately there is no soy in the feed. Just make sure you tell people what the feeding program is when they ask about raw milk.\nQ.\u00a0 How much milk do you recommend drinking?\nA.\u00a0 We recommend 1 quart per day for pregnant and nursing women.\u00a0 We don't have any specific recommendations for children and other adults--it really depends on their personal tastes and preferences.\nQ.\u00a0 I'm well-aware that raw milk is best, and that's what we drink in our family, but if someone doesn\u2019t drink raw milk, I assume it is best to at least be sure to drink whole milk, but if heating/pasteurizing the milk oxidizes the cholesterol, is it better to say drink either raw milk or NO milk?\nA.\u00a0 Regarding milk, the more I learn about pasteurization, the more I realize how harmful it is (for other reasons than the oxidation of cholesterol).\u00a0 And now most milk is ultra-pasteurized, especially most organic milk.\nI think if people can't get raw milk, the next best thing is pasteurized (not ultra-pasteurized) cream diluted with water. The fats are much less prone to damage by pasteurization than the water portion of the milk, and at least the fats in cream have not been homogenized.\u00a0 This is what I did for my family when we could not get raw milk.\u00a0 We used diluted cream on porridge and in cooking.\nQ. Do you know whether the heat process of clarifying butter would destroy the \"x factor\" in grass feed dairy ghee?\nA. Answer from Chris Masterjohn:\nMy understanding is that heat destroys the Wulzen anti-stiffness factor but not the X factor, which is consistent with heat having little effect on vitamin K2.\n"}, {"score": 368.23358, "uuid": "fdf0eb2d-645e-5397-bef6-a7dca670815d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0207wb-23-33274", "target_hostname": "www.nofamass.org", "target_uri": "http://www.nofamass.org/programs/organicdairy/rawmilk.php", "page_rank": 3.0315224e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "NOFA Massachusetts: Programs: NOFA Massachusetts Raw Milk Network", "snippet": "It <em>tastes</em> <em>better</em>, is more beneficial to human health and the health of the environment, and directly supports local farmers and communities.

NOFA/Mass is working to make safe, healthy raw milk and raw milk cheeses easily available in Massachusetts.\nResources and Information About Raw Milk .\nPeople around the world have milked animals (cows, sheep, goats, camels, etc.) for thousands of years-consuming the raw milk directly and preserving it in the form of dairy products.\nPasteurized milk (heated to over 160 \u00b0F) is a relatively new product. Pasteurization came about less than a century ago, as a reaction to milk produced in urban dairies from cows kept in confinement and fed industrial waste-largely from distilleries. Contamination of such milk was controlled by heating it (\"pasteurizing\" it) to kill all bacteria, both the good and the bad.\nEventually the urban dairies disappeared, but pasteurization remained. Now a growing number of people are learning that fresh milk from nearby dairy farms-where cows still graze outside and are managed using organic and sustainable practices-does not need pasteurization. It tastes better, is more beneficial to human health and the health of the environment, and directly supports local farmers and communities. In Massachusetts there are more than 24 farms that pass rigorous inspections and are certified to sell raw milk from their farm stores. Visit one of these farms to learn more about this vital and healthy product.\nWhy Is Raw Milk So Good?\nRaw milk is the ultimate whole food. It contains many nutrients essential to human health, and comes complete with companion enzymes and amino acids necessary for the human body to make use of those nutrients.\nRaw milk contains:\nHigh levels of calcium and other minerals, and the enzymes necessary to metabolize these minerals. Those enzymes are destroyed in the pasteurization process.\nAn abundance of beneficial bacteria that can rebalance a digestive system unable to process many foods, and can restore the immune system. These good bacteria help produce and assimilate vitamins and minerals, fight off illnesses, and regulate bodily processes. Pasteurization destroys all bacteria in milk.\nWater- and fat-soluble vitamins, two-thirds or more of which are destroyed during pasteurization. Vitamins B6 and B12 are almost entirely destroyed during pasteurization. More than 50% of milk's Vitamin C value is lost to pasteurization as well. Milk from grass-fed cows is higher in Vitamins A and D and has more omega-3 fatty acids (\"the good fats\") and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA).\nA level of fat necessary for the body to absorb milk's calcium and protein. Pasteurized reduced-fat or skim milk is an ineffective source of calcium.\nThe enzymes phosphatase, essential for the absorption of calcium; lipase, which aids in the digestion of fats; and lactase, which helps with the digestion of lactose. Pasteurization, however, destroys all three of these enzymes.\nAmino acids, essential to the body's ability to repair tissue, metabolize protein and generate energy. Pasteurization renders these acids useless.\nEconomic Benefits of Raw Milk\nIn 1950, Massachusetts had nearly 5,000 dairy farms. In 2008, there are fewer than 180 left. The main cause for this tragedy is economic. Rising fuel and feed costs in the Northeast mean local dairies cannot compete with large, industrialized confinement dairies operating in the Midwest and Canada. Fresh raw milk, however, sells at the farm for $6 to $10 per gallon-3 to 4 times what bottlers pay.\nWhen consumers buy milk directly from the farmer they are helping to preserve their community by paying a fair price. That way the farmer can cover costs and afford to support a family.\nEnvironmental Benefits of Raw Milk\nFarms selling raw milk and receiving a retail price are more sustainable, meaning long-term preservation of open space and the use of management practices that are beneficial to the environment.\nCows are healthiest when they are able to be outdoors, grazing on pasture. In turn, they fertilize the soil and experience fewer animal health problems. When cows graze on pasture, less energy is needed to mow, bale, and move hay, reducing fossil fuel use and cutting the carbon impact of producing a valuable food.\nMassachusetts has many small grass-based dairies that are able to foster long-term sustainable farming practices, protecting the environment and the preservation of the rural and agricultural character of Massachusetts.\nPractical Benefits of Raw Milk\nRaw milk is extremely versatile. The milk and cream can be separated and the cream can be used to make butter, buttermilk, cream, ice cream, and sour cream. The milk can be consumed directly or used to make kefir, yogurt and cheeses.\nThe freshness and purity of farm fresh milk leads to very little waste. Milk purchased fresh from the farm will keep up to two weeks when refrigerated. If it sours, the milk -- unlike pasteurized milk, which goes bad -- is still healthy and can be used for baking, biscuits, pancakes, etc.\nThe information above is from a NOFA/Mass brochure, Raw Milk in Massachusetts .\nTHE NOFA/MASS RAW MILK NETWORK\nIf you are a consumer or dairy producer wanting to be part of The Raw Milk Network to help make safely-produced raw milk available throughout Massachusetts, contact Winton Pitcoff, Raw Milk Network Coordinator, at winton@nofamass.org , or at\n(413) 634-5728.\nThis page was last modified on January 19, 2012 at 12:15:16 PM. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Translate this page:\nNortheast Organic Farming Association, Massachusetts Chapter\n411 Sheldon Road | Barre, MA | 01005 | (978) 355-2853 | FAX: (978) 355-4046 |\n\u00a9 2002 - 2012 NOFA/Massachusetts\nNOFA/Mass is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization.

Then came the paperwork, legal enough presumably, to protect the source of the illicit substance. Finally, Yaron Milgrom-Elcott received the monthly drop site: an address near Chelsea, open for two hours, show up or lose the white stuff.\nMr. Milgrom-Elcott never missed a drop. Each month, he joined mothers with newborns and Wall Street titans in search of a box of unpasteurized, unhomogenized, raw milk. He is also part of a movement of perhaps hundreds of thousands across the country who will risk illness or even death to drink their milk the way Americans did for centuries: straight from the cow.\nTwenty years ago, the Food and Drug Administration banned interstate sales of unpasteurized milk. This spring the agency warned consumers again that they were risking their health drinking raw milk.\nStill, individual states determine how raw milk is bought and sold within their borders. While its sale for human consumption is illegal in 15 states, New York is one of 26 where it can be bought with restrictions. The chief one is that raw milk can only be sold on the premises of one of 19 dairy farms approved by the state. Clandestine milk clubs, like the one Mr. Milgrom-Elcott joined, are one way of circumventing the law, and there are others.\nRaw milk drinkers may praise its richer flavor or claim it is more nutritious than pasteurized milk. No matter why they drink it, the demand for it is booming. In 2000, the Organic Pastures Dairy Company in the San Joaquin Valley near Fresno became California\u2019s first raw milk dairy with certified organic pasture land. This year its co-founder, Mark McAfee, expects it to gross $6 million \u2014 up from $4.9 last year.\nHis raw milk is sold in 300 stores in California, where it is legal. He also has an $80,000 a month mail order business, shipping creams and cheese as well as milk to all 50 states. He believes he reaches 35,000 customers a week for his raw milk products. Because the laws allow interstate shipping of raw milk that is not meant for human consumption, Organic Pastures milk is labeled as pet food.\n\u201cI like to go into the warehouse and see the addresses \u2014 it goes all over creation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same customers day in and day out. We\u2019re the entry point. We hear back that shipping is too expensive but that they found a local provider, either a farm or on the black market. They have got to have it.\u201d\nMr. McAfee said he knows firsthand of more than six dairies in Pennsylvania, some of them Amish, that supply the black market in New York and Boston. \u201cThey\u2019re sending in 200 cases of milk every month,\u201d he said.\nSome drink it for the same reason raw milk cheeses are popular: the taste. \u201cI first discovered it two summers ago in France,\u201d said Mr. Milgrom-Elcott, who is pursuing a doctorate in medieval Jewish mysticism at New York University. \u201cThere is a richness and density unlike processed milk, plus there\u2019s this complexity of flavor.\u201d\nOthers believe that it is good for them. Pasteurization \u2014 a process of heating and quickly cooling milk to kill pathogens such as E. coli, salmonella and listeria \u2014 also destroys beneficial bacteria, proteins and enzymes, they say. Advocates attribute stronger immune and better digestive systems to raw milk. Many have incorporated it into their diet as part of a broader philosophy to treat their bodies and the planet properly.\nNina Planck, the author of \u201cReal Food: What to Eat and Why,\u201d defied the F.D.A.\u2019s warning and drank raw milk while she was pregnant. She not only continues to drink it while nursing her 9-month-old son, Julian, but also allows him the occasional sip. She has an arrangement with a couple of farmers to deliver it to New York City.\n\u201cWe drink raw milk because we trust the traditional food chain more than the industrial one,\u201d said Ms. Planck, who knows a number of farmers from her days as director of the New York City Greenmarkets and through her boyfriend, Rob Kaufelt, the owner of Murray\u2019s Cheese in Greenwich Village.\n\u201cWe\u2019re willing to spend more money the higher up the food chain we go,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not alone, either. You cannot categorize the people who are drinking raw milk. They are people from the blue states and red states, farmers and yuppies and Birkenstock wearers.\u201d\nFood scientists can hardly believe that so many consumers have turned their back on one of the most successful public health endeavors of the 20th century. In 1938, for example, milk caused 25 percent of all outbreaks of food- and water-related sickness.\nWith the advent of universal pasteurization, that number fell to 1 percent by 1993, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition advocacy group in Washington.\nDavid Barbano, director of the Northeast Dairy Foods Research Center, operated by Cornell and the University of Vermont and supported by the dairy industry, grew up drinking raw milk on a family farm. He does not remember ever getting sick, but says science has never found any evidence that it was more beneficial than pasteurized milk. In fact, he said, raw milk has very little vitamin D, which is added to most pasteurized milk.\n\u201cThere is always going to be a percentage of raw milk that carries disease-causing bacteria,\u201d said Dr. Barbano, who is a professor of food science at Cornell. \u201cAs long as I have pasteurized milk available for me, and I guess more importantly for my daughter, the risk is not worth any benefit anyone has been able to prove.\u201d\nSally Fallon, president of the Westin A. Price Foundation, another nutrition advocacy group, argues that the risk to raw milk drinkers is insignificant, and the demand for product is growing steadily. In 1998, when the Washington-based foundation created the Web site realmilk.com, it barely had half a page of sources where raw milk could be purchased legally. Now, the list has grown to more than two dozen pages, and Ms. Fallon puts the number of raw milk drinkers at half a million.\n\u201cWe are trying to be pragmatic and create demand,\u201d said Ms. Fallon of the 10,000-member, 400-chapter foundation, which has mounted legal challenges to raw milk regulations in several states. \u201cEven though it is illegal in some places, it is very available through cow sharing or cow herding programs.\u201d\nIn Virginia, for example, Chip and Susan Planck \u2014 Nina\u2019s parents \u2014 pay $40 a year plus $25 monthly to own a share in one cow, the only legal way to get raw milk in that state. In return, they get a gallon of raw milk a week. It is technically not a sale but compensation for the cow\u2019s room and board.\nLast year the Hawthorne Valley Farm in Ghent, N.Y., offered a buyers\u2019 club program to its raw milk customers in the hopes of giving a bigger boost to a steadily growing market. It was designed to encourage those customers in New York and beyond to order in bulk but send only one representative a week to pick up the order.\nWhen the New York State Department Public Interestand Markets caught wind of it, however, it asked Hawthorne to end the program and the farm complied. Still, Abe Madey, the farm\u2019s dairy manager and cheesemaker, says business is steady. About 100 regular customers, many of whom drive two hours from New York City, purchase up to 7,500 gallons annually of raw milk worth about $45,000 to the farm, he said.\nThe milk club that Mr. Milgrom-Elcott belongs to, and others like it, is far more problematic, according to Jessica A. Chittenden, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture and Markets department. She says the 41 milk inspectors charged with the monthly testing of New York\u2019s 5,000 dairy farms had not yet turned their attention to the clandestine dropoffs.\n\u201cIt is under review,\u201d said Ms. C\nhittenden, adding that the department cited five of the raw milk permit holders for violations in the past year. \u201cOur utmost concern is for public health. We are trying to insure that the safest products are out there.\u201d\nFor a few months anyhow, Mr. Milgrom-Elcott can shed his identity of a potential law-breaker. His wife, Miriam Sheinbein, just finished her third year at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and is currently serving a brief rotation in San Francisco. In California, raw milk is legal and widely available. While Ms. Sheinbein, who is 19 weeks pregnant, has decided to forego the delicacy until the baby is born, Mr. Milgrom-Elcott is delighted to take his habit above-ground.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to live without,\u201d he said.\nBut then again, Mr. Milgrom-Elcott\u2019s secret life in New York was not without its thrills.\n\u201cWe also bought cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche from the milk club,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was nearly as ethereal as our fromager\u2019s in Aix-en-Provence.\u201d\n"}, {"score": 360.9393, "uuid": "e0d05ba9-543a-53f9-914c-22b52ab140d5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1611wb-52-09572", "target_hostname": "www.beyondsalmon.com", "target_uri": "http://www.beyondsalmon.com/2009/12/creme-fraiche-at-home.html", "page_rank": 1.1813304e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Beyond Salmon: Cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che at home", "snippet": "The warmer the <em>better</em>.

I started making my own cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche inspired by Diana at Off the Bone and got kind of addicted to it.\nNo, it's not real cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. For the real stuff you have to go to France. Real cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is what happens when unpasteurized cream matures on its own. It gets thicker and much more complex tasting (sweet, nutty, and a little tangy). Mock cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is what happens when you introduce lactic bacteria to pasteurized cream and let it ferment. It's not quite the same thing, but on this side of the Atlantic, it will do. You can buy cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche in most upscale super markets (like Whole Foods), but I am not crazy about it. That stuff is as stiff as mascarpone and drizzling it over soup or dessert doesn't work. When you make it at home, you are in full control of thickness, so that's one reason I started doing it myself.\nThe second reason was practicality. My favorite brand of cream is High Lawn. It's inexpensive and has great flavor, but spoils extremely quickly. I used to view it as a drawback, but after I got onto my cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche kick, I realized it's a blessing. Since this cream is only pasteurized (not ultra-pasteurized), you can ferment it. That's the same reason, it spoils fast. Once it's fermented, it can live in the fridge for a very long time. I am not sure how long exactly because my jar of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche disappears too quickly. But I've kept it as long as 3 weeks, and I am sure it could go even longer.\nThe good news is that unlike other fermenting activities that require washing lots of dishes (strainers, pots, bowls, cheesecloth, slotted spoons, and thermometers) and a good bit of active time, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche requires almost no work and no dishes.\nPour heavy cream (pasteurized is fine, but not ultra-pasteurized) into a clean glass jar. You want to start this process when your cream is still perfectly good. In other words, don't wait for it to sit in your fridge for a week and spoil and then try to ferment it.\nMicrowave until very warm, but not hot. If you want to use a thermometer, you want to get to 110-120F.\nAdd plain yogurt (full-fat if possible). I use Stony Field Farm's. The rough proportion is 1 cup cream to 2 Tbsp yogurt, but I never measure it. The exact ratio is not crucial as long as you are introducing some lactic bacteria and have way more cream than yogurt. Stir well and leave uncovered (or covered with cheesecloth) at room temperature until it thickens, 24-48 hours.\nIf your cream is not homogenized (the one I use isn't), you'll get a thin yellow fat cap on top. Do not stir it in or you'll get little chunks of solid fat in your cream. To test if your cream is done, shake the jar gently. If the fat cap doesn't jiggle (or only barely), it's worth a real test. Carefully remove and discard the fat cap and check the consistency of cream. How thick you want it is a personal preference. Keep in mind that it will thicken slightly after it's refrigerated. If it turns out that it's too thin, try to keep it in a warm place and continue fermenting it.\nWhen the cream is done, cover and keep in the fridge for several weeks.\nThe tough part is getting the bacteria to grow and the cream to thicken. Here are some guiding principles and tips on that. Every ten degrees, bacteria growth doubles (up to 120F -- after that the heat might kill them). The warmer the better. Bacteria grow really well between 90-120F. As you can imagine that's a hard temperature to maintain especially in winter. My guess is that my kitchen is at about 65F right now. At that rate, the cream might spoil faster than it ferments. How will you know if it spoils? You'll know -- it will start to smell and taste absolutely awful, not tangy and pleasant, but disgusting.\nHere is how I get it to ferment in about 24 hours in winter. I put the jar in a bowl of hot water and change the water whenever I remember. I also found that my oven keeps the heat extremely well. It will still be warm 4 hours after I turn it off. If yours is like that, you can pre-heat it to 200F, then turn it off, and put your cream into it.\nIf you start your creme fraiche today, you will have it ready for Christmas, and that's not a bad thing to have on hand over the holidays :)\nAt least Samantha thinks so.\nHappy and Delicious Holidays to you, my dear readers!\n"}, {"score": 360.62976, "uuid": "7ce00ec1-ff0f-5b12-aa83-454ff61acb1e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1413wb-64-08818", "target_hostname": "ecoliinformation.com", "target_uri": "http://ecoliinformation.com/tag/ecoli-poisoning/page/3/", "page_rank": 1.1724143e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "E coli | Ecoli Poisoning - Part 3", "snippet": "Some people choose to drink raw milk because they believe it is healthier or <em>tastes</em> <em>better</em>.

The meeting, to be held at the USDA offices in Washington, D.C. will address the need to increase the speed and accuracy of food poisoning outbreak investigations and implement procedures to prevent future outbreaks.\n\u201cThis public meeting provides an opportunity for FDA to collaborate more closely with FSIS as well as with members of the food industry, many of whom have been making important innovations in food safety practices and technology, and all of whom bear primary responsibility for producing and marketing safe food,\u201d said Michael R. Taylor, senior advisor to FDA\u2019s Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, M.D.\nThe announcement comes in the wake of a multistate outbreak of E. coli 0157:H7 that struck 26 people in late October and early November, killing two and hospitalizing others. The illnesses are associated with more than half a million pounds of ground beef that was recalled Oct. 31 by Ashville, N.Y.-based Fairbank Farms. Just days earlier, another recall of about 1,000 pounds of beef from a Massachusetts firm was associated with several cases of E. coli 0157:H7 in a group of Rhode Island school children.\nFood safety attorney Fred Pritzker supports the FSIS and FDA in their recognition that it is vital to improve America\u2019s faltering food safety system by addressing gaps in food product tracing and mandating testing and inspection at all points along the food supply chain. \u201cFamilies should not have to worry about whether the food on their dinner table, be it hamburgers or salad, is contaminated with E. coli,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cThere are clear measures government officials can take to mitigate that risk.\u201d\nThere are many strains of E. coli bacteria that are categorized into more than 170 serogroups, which in turn are broken down into one or more serotypes. The E. coli strain primarily responsible for E. coli-related injury and death is classified as Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli 0157:H7). The harmful pathogen can do severe damage to the intestinal lining and can also result in hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) , which is the leading cause of kidney failure in children in the United States.\nThose interested in attending the public meeting can pre-register online and consumer inquiries may be directed to: 888-INFO-FDA.\nPosted by Pritzker Olsen on Jul 24, 2008 in E. coli Outbreak | 0 comments\nFour people have fallen ill after consuming raw milk purchased from Town Farm Diary of Simsburg, Connecticut.

Heather has been doing research into the culture, business, and politics around cheese. In this paper (link below), she talks about the politics around cheese made from raw milk.\nRaw milk, milk that is not pasteurized, is making a comeback (check out this article from the globe ). And it flies in the convention of our predominantly sterile mentality (morality?) of antibiotics, pasteurization, anti-bacteria soaps, latex glove, masks, and hand sanitizers. Since the Ghost Map was drawn, we\u2019ve been getting better and better at separating ourselves from microorganisms.\nOne big guy who changed how we deal with microorganisms was Loius Pasteur (ironically, I work a few blocks from a road named after him). Based on his work, we regularly \u201cpasteurize\u201d things like milk through high heat and pressure to kill all the microorganisms, good and bad.\nOur pasteurized world has indeed been good to us health-wise. Indeed, my wife, a vet, knows all too well what could happen if one ingested spoiled raw milk. Why take a chance? Though I do think there might be a middle ground, what with all the understanding and science we have. But there\u2019s something indicative when you have to sign a waiver to buy raw milk.\nWhich takes us to the raw milk cheese. The process of making cheese uses microbes to turn raw unpasteurized milk in to a safe and stable product. That\u2019s why humans have made all sorts of \u201c controlled spoilage \u201d foods. And the microbes that grow on cheese can be beneficial to our health (much like folks now claim with live yoghurt).\nBut the idea of a product made from unpasteurized milk flies in the face of our ingrained Pasteurian ideals. Paxson analyzes the microbiopolitics that arises from this cognitive dissonance.\nPaxson is not some anti-Pasteurian extremist, she knows that there\u2019s a reason we keep an eye on the microbes on our food. She also knows that, at least with cheese making, worrying about raw milk does not make sense, considering the microbiology and tradition of cheese making. And the cheese maker she profiles is a great example of the balance of careful practice of microbiology and deep craft of cheese production.\nIn the past few years, there has been an increase in the numbers of reports regarding asthma, intestinal diseases, skin conditions, superbugs, and other health effects from a sterile, Pasteurian world gone too far. Paxson\u2019s work fits in that discussion thread. To me, the discussion around raw milk cheese will do more (more so than raw milk alone) to awake us to a post-Pasteurian world where we understand the role of microbes in our life and food (check out this raw milk cheese manifesto , too).\nAnd if you\u2019re curious about practical uses of microbes and the future balance between man and bug, you\u2019d read her article ( download the PDF or go to Paxson\u2019s site ). And then let me know what you think of the coming Post-Pasteurian Age.\n"}, {"score": 348.19305, "uuid": "bc17f30d-e2de-5db2-a7ea-0600ce597fe1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0103wb-80-10603", "target_hostname": "www.canfightbac.org", "target_uri": "http://www.canfightbac.org/cpcfse/en/cookwell/ask/dairy/", "page_rank": 1.5579747e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Canadian Partnership for Consumer Food Safety Education", "snippet": "Why is the shelf life for <em>unpasteurized</em> yogurt longer <em>than</em> that for <em>pasteurized</em> milk?

Some molds cause spoilage by growing on the surface of cheese. They produce streaks of discoloration, clumps of blue, green or white fuzzy looking growths \u2013 these molds are bad and unsafe to eat! \u2022 If mold forms on hard or firm cheese (e.g., cheddar, parmesan), generously trim off mold plus 2.5 cm (1 inch) of cheese surrounding it (be careful to keep your knife clean of mold); wrap the trimmed cheese in new wax/plastic wrap and refrigerate. \u2022 Discard fresh cheese, soft cheese (e.g., feta, brie, camembert) and processed cheese that is moldy. It is difficult to judge how far the mold has penetrated \u2013 so do not keep it, or eat it. To prevent mold growth on cheese, refrigerate cheese sealed in its original packaging, until ready to use. Once opened, wrap the cheese tightly in waxed paper or plastic wrap and keep refrigerated. If moisture has condensed on the cheese, wipe it off with a clean paper towel before rewrapping.\nI left some cottage cheese out for 3 hours. Is it safe to eat?\nNo, it is not safe to eat. When perishable foods like cottage cheese are left at room temperature for longer than 2 hours bacteria can develop that cause foodborne illness.\nHow many days past the 'best before' date is yogurt safe to eat?\nIt will be safe for many days after the date stamped on the container but you may not want to eat it. The date is a 'best before' date and it indicates how long the yogurt will retain its freshness and high quality if properly handled and stored. After that date, there will be a gradual loss of flavor, texture, and nutrients so use it up as quickly as possible. Use My Handy Chart on the website for other storage info.\nIs butter kept at room temperature safe to eat? Or should butter be refrigerated?\nButter should be kept refrigerated. When it is left for too long a period at room temperature, it will develop a rancid taste. Also, keep butter in its original wrapper to prevent spoilage that may result from exposure to light and air.\nHow long is it safe to keep cream and heavy cream in the refrigerator after it has been opened?\nFor optimum quality and food safety, cream should be used by the 'best before' date. However, once opened the storage life depends on how the cream has been stored and handled by the consumer.\nShould young children eat Brie cheese?\nIt is recommended that pregnant women, older adults and people with weakened immune systems or who are at higher risk for foodborne disease do not eat soft cheeses such as Brie unless they are labelled as made with pasteurized milk. This may apply to young children, depending on their age and health. For more information read CFIA\u2019s fact sheet on Listeria .\nI opened a jar of apple butter and put it back in the cupboard for 24 hours. Is it still ok to eat?\nUnfortunately, the apple butter should be discarded. Perishable foods if left at room temperature for longer than two hours can potentially contain organisms that can spoil the food or cause foodborne illness.\nIs it safe to eat ice cream after it has melted and then refrozen?\nNo, it is not recommended to eat thawed ice cream. Ice cream is a perishable food product that needs to be kept frozen. If it was thawed in a freezer that lost power it may have spoiled and/or may harbour microorganisms that cause foodborne illness. Also, the taste and texture of the ice cream after refreezing may not be palatable.\nI left a new container of yogurt in the trunk of my car for several hours and it was quite warm. It is my understanding that yogurt does not really \"spoil\". Can still I refrigerate it and safely eat it?\nNo, you need to discard the yogurt. It is a perishable food that requires refrigeration. Opened yogurt should be used within 7 to 10 days.\nI read on your Q and A page that cream cheese cannot be left out. Does it make a difference if the package has never been opened ?\nCream cheese is a perishable dairy product and must be kept refrigerated whether the package has been opened or not.\nI forgot to put my cheese in the fridge last night after going grocery shopping and woke up to find it on the counter. It was only out of the fridge for about 9-10 hours, and it's in a sealed package. Is it still safe to eat?\nDiscard the cheese. It may no longer be safe to consume as it was left in the danger zone temperature for more than two hours. Check out\u00a0the fact sheet on chilling on this web site for more information.\nI ate some cheddar cheese and then noticed that it had a spot of mold. If I ingested some will it make me sick, and if so what are the symptoms?\nIi is unlikely that you will be sick over consuming a very small quantity of mold as you described if you did consume any.\u00a0 Some mold found on\u00a0foods may produce some toxins that could cause mild diarrhea if ingested in appreciable quantity which would not be your case here.\nI accidentally left an unopened large slab of parmesan cheese out of fridge for several hours after it had been refrigerated. \u00a0Can it still be eaten?\nRemember the two hour rule. If perishable food such as the parmesan cheese has been left in the danger zone temperature (room temperature)\u00a0for more that two hours, it may not be safe to eat. When in doubt, throw it out.\nMy husband left out the small block of fresh parmesan last night and I accidently served a small portion of it to my children on their pasta today for lunch. Could this harm them in anyway? Needless to say, they are both running fevers right now...I'm guessing it's just coincidence because they did not eat that much of it, but curious what your thoughts are on this. Thank You, Karyn\nBecause the cheese was left in the danger zone temperature, pathogenic microorganisms could cause\u00a0 foodbourne illness in your children. At the first signs of illness, diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps, etc, please contact your doctor as soon as possible. Don't take any chances.\nHow long does crumbled Blue Cheese stay fresh? How do you know whether Blue Cheese is \"spoiled\" or not, since molding is a natural part of it's aging process?\nThe Best Before Date is a good guide to how long crumbled blue cheese can be refrigerated or two to three weeks. After that date, there will be loss of\u00a0flavor and texture.\nI recently bought a large pack of yogurt cups and left them on the kitchen counter overnight had someone tell me that it has to be warmed to spoil and room temperature did not hurt it...true or should I throw it away?\nPlease discard the yogurt. It has been in the danger zone temperature for more than two hours. Room temperature is an ideal temperature for food bourne pathogens to multiply or develop toxins which can cause illness. Check out my fact sheets on chill!\nIf yogurt is pasteurized and vacuum sealed, how can germs or bacteria grow in an unopened container?\nPasteurization reduces harmful bacteria. It does not sterilize yogourt.\u00a0 Competition takes place between lactic acid\u00a0bacteria that fermented the milk and\u00a0other microflora.\u00a0 We could think of molds and yeasts.\u00a0 Once the lactic acid bacteria dies off, spores of molds and yeast could developed and take over. Those microorganisms\u00a0can still cause changes in quality after the Best Before Date.\nI had my cream cheese in the fridge, and I think the fuse blew over night. It was still cold this morning though, is it still okay to eat. Or does it have to be kept at a certain temp all the time?\nCream cheese should be kept at or below the safe refrigerator temperature of 4 degrees C/40 degrees F. If stored at a higher temperature for longer than two hours, throw it away.\nDear Mrs. Cookwell, Because mold is part of some cheeses we buy (blue cheese, etc.), it makes me wonder whether some molds that grow on cheeses after we buy them are also fine to eat, even if some are not. I've noticed, for example, that the mold that grows on parmesan and padano cheese (especially if it's already grated) smells and tastes like gorgonzola. Thank you!\nThe molds that are used in the production of cheeses like Blue, Gorgonzola, Stilton, etc. are specially cultured molds, done so in a controlled environment. Unfortunately, our refridgerators is not one of those controlled environments and the molds that we might find on cheeses in our fridge are causing spoilage of the cheese, not adding flavor. These molds are unsafe to eat and may be producing poisons called mycotoxins which become part of the food and are not destroyed by cooking.\nIf mold is on a hard cheese such as cheddar, it can be cut away plus one inch of cheese surrounding it. If mold is growing on a fresh\u00a0cheese like cream cheese, cottage cheese\u00a0or on soft cheese such as Brie, discard it.\nI purchased some precrumble blue cheese at a big box store. I opened it to use and one week later I looked and there was mold all over it. It has been refrigerated the whole time and is not even near it's date. Would it be unsafe to cook with it?\nDo not consume the cheese, even though it has not reached the best before date. For some reason, it has been contaminated with mold spores and these do grow slowly at refrigeration temperatures. Wrap the cheese well and discard. Cooking it will not make it safe.\nI\u00a0have had had cream cheese in my fridge since April and it is now September. Is it safe to use it because it was never opened?!?\nIf properly refrigerated, an unopened package of cream cheese is good 1 month past the Best When Purchased By date on the carton. Once opened cream cheese should be used within 10 days.\na piece of mozzerella string cheese was left out overnight. Can I still eat it?\nNo, do not eat the string cheese. It is a perishable food that requires refrigeration for storage. And now, it has been left at room temperature for more than two hour so it may not be safe to eat.\nHow long can unwrapped butter be stored in the fridge.\nRecommended storage time for butter once the package is opened is 7 days. If it is unsalted butter, it will keep for 3 weeks once opened.\nHi Mrs. Cookwell!\u00a0 How long after the expiry date can we consume partly skimmed milk with lan extended\u00a0shelf-life?\u00a0 Can we still use it\u00a0refrigerated or should we keep it to make milk base recipes? (re: pancakes). Thanks.\nThe date on the package is likely a best before date which is a guide for optimum quality. Providing the milk has been properly handled and stored (refrigerated), it can be safely used beyond that date. You will be able to tell its beyond using once it develops the sour milk odour.\nMy package of Kraft Swiss Cheese (expires in Jan.2007)has blown up like a balloon. Is it safe to use in a quiche?\nThis a question best answered by Kraft Canada. There toll-free number is 1-800-567-KRAFT (5723). Or go their web site at www.kraftcanada.com\nI bought a large package of individually wrapped string cheese at a warehouse store. Upon opening the package, I noticed that many of the cheeses had lost their uniform shape and looked a little mashed/twisted. I opened one and noticed a small amount of milky residue on the package, but no odor or discoloration. Is there a way to tell if a cheese product has not been stored properly prior to purchase? Does the appearance I'm describing suggest improper storage? Thanks!\nMy best advice for you is to contact the manufacturer of the cheese. Check the package for a toll free number or website. Be prepared to provide the code information from the package so the manufacturer is able track the product if necessary. And, you can return the product to the store where it was purchased.\nHi.\u00a0 My 5 year old daughter goes to\u00a0kindergarten.\u00a0 I prepare for her some snacks that contain often dairy products (milk, yoghurt or cheese) that I put in a thermos bag with a ice pack.\u00a0 Unfortunately, for practical reasons (I was told), her snacks end up outside her thermos bag and stay a room temperature for 1 and a half to 2 hours.\u00a0 Is this acceptable and safe?\u00a0 Thank you!\nI think that you have a right to be concerned about the kindergarten removing the perishable snacks from the thermos bag. I recommend that perishable food not be left at room temperature for more than 2 hours. The kindergarten is still in the safety zone but very close to the two hours. They don't know how long that food may already have been at room temperature\nI bought a large tub of feta cheese, and it has been sitting in my refrigerator for several weeks. It's kept in the salt water it came in and smells fine, is it still alright to eat? How long will feta keep?\nThe recommended storage time for feta cheese is about 2 weeks or according to date on the packaging.\nCan I mail Colby cheese to England, which takes about 10 days without refrigeration and still be good to eat\nColby cheese is a firm cheese like cheddar and should be kept refrigerated.\u00a0So if you shipped it to England, the quality\u00a0would be affected and there could be contamination with harmful bacteria.\nMrs. Cookwell, I have a 6 year old son who likes to take sweet rice to school in his lunch. It is made with canned milk. I usually heat it up before I put it in his thermos. I pour hot water into his thermos first to heat it up like the directions say, but my sister told me it was unsafe for him to take this in his lunch. She also told me it is unsafe to send him hot chocolate in his thermos because I make our hot chocolate with milk and hersheys syrup. Could you please tell me if this is okay or not? We use a crayola thermos for kids thanks for your time Tammi and Alex\nYour sister may be right. This may not be safe if the food in the thermos does not stay piping hot 74C/165F. You can test that. Prepare your thermos as you would nomally do and fill with rice as warm as normal. Let stand\u00a0the amount of time before eaten by your son then measure the temperature of the rice with a food thermometer. It should be the above temperature. Then run the\u00a0same test with hot chocolate. Of course, any leftovers\u00a0brought home from school should be discarded.\nI have packages of danish brie and danish camembert - but they expired over a year ago - the package has never been opened - still looks fine when i opened it - is it still safe to eat?\nYou cannot see contamination with harmful bacteria or some types of spoilage. These cheeses should definitely not be consumed one year after the expiry or Best Before Date.\nI have a slab of parmesan in the fridge. It hasn't been wrapped too tightly and parts of the cheese have turned white. it doesn't smell or look like mold. is it still ok to eat?\nBecause it has not been wrapped tightly, the white may be mould or just dryness from exposure.\u00a0 Just\u00a0removed before the rest of the cheese is used. Scrape it off or cut off 2.5 cm (1 inch)\u00a0around the white portion.Wipe the remaining cheese with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Then wrap tightly in aluminum foil or plastic wrap before storing in the refrigerator.\nI bought a round of brie cheese at the store, it was not refrigerated, so I didn't refrigerate at home. Is it safe to eat?\nTo preserve its quality and safety, brie cheese\u00a0should normally\u00a0be kept refrigerated both at the store and at home.\u00a0 In your case, discuss it with the store where you bought the cheese.\nif miracle whip was left out on kitchen table for 4 hours can it still be used safely for anything?\nDiscard your Miracle Whip. Once opened it can safely be left at room temperature for only 1 to 2 hours.\nI left a pumpkin roll out overnight that has a cream cheese / butter / powdered sugar mixture. Is this now bad to eat?\nYes, it may be bad to eat. Any roll with a cream cheese/butter filling or frosting should be kept refrigerated.\nI woke up in the morning to find that my freezer door was opened and had been open all night (7-8 hours). I had frozen raw meats (poultry, steak, ground beef), pre-cooked frozen dinners, ice cream, and margarine inside. Are these items still okay to consume?\nThe ice cream should be discarded. If the temperature in the freezer did not rise above 4 degrees C/40 degrees F, the\u00a0other items would be safe to consume. If the meats and frozen dinners contained ice crystals, they could be refrozen.\nHi!\u00a0 I have a question on milk\u00a0shelf life.\u00a0 Even if the milk has been sterilized, it expires;\u00a0why?\u00a0 How can we explain that in a\u00a0molecular point of view.\u00a0 Thank you!\nThe expiry date on a food is an indication where the manufacturer will guarantee that is product will be at its upmost quality, even if sterilized.\u00a0 However, in a sterilized product, the expiry date could be much further away than a similar pasteurized product.\u00a0 After the expiry date, product breakdown could take place due to environmental factors such as light.\u00a0 It is well known that vitamins and some milk nutrients are sensitive to light and would breakdown faster if\u00a0exposed.\u00a0\u00a0 With time, milk components can separate.\u00a0 You could have fat substances of the milk that would stick on the walls of the container.\u00a0 This will go much fater once the container is opened.\u00a0 Proteins would breakdown and fat would turn rancid and you don't always need bacteria for this to happen.\nHow long will a cheese fondue be edible after I make it?

Can this cheese give you food poisoning?\nYou can get food poisoning from cheese.\u00a0 Bacteria that make you sick do not usually change the appearance, taste or smell of the food.\u00a0 It's difficult to say what the white flakes are without seeing them.\u00a0 If in doubt, throw it out!\nHow long will opened sweetened condensed milk stay good in the ice box?\nRemove the contents from the can and you may store this in your refrigerator for 4 -5 days.\nhow long can you keep canned food ( soup etc)no expiry date on cans just a bunch of numbers also cake mixes how long past the expiry date\nCanned foods that are not exposed to extreme heat or cold, may be stored for 2 -5 years if they are low acid foods (contain little acid such as corn, beans) or 12 - 18 months for high acid foods (such as fruit).\u00a0 The cakes should be used by their best before date to ensure quality and wholesomeness.\u00a0 Cake mixes have a shelf life of 12 months unopen in the pantry.\nTonight, we had burritos.\u00a0 After eating the first one I realised that the sour cream we were eating went out of date 4 days ago.\u00a0 My two children ate them.\u00a0 Can this be dangerous?\nThe best before date on sour cream indicates optimal freshness, quality and nutrition.\u00a0 You should be safe.\u00a0 If there is mould on the surface or inside the container, throw it out!\u00a0 Try using your food before the best before dates expire.\nI made a carrot cake but the next day I noticed some of the carrots had turned green. This was not mold, nor was there anything wrong with the carrots before I put them into the cake - in fact the carrots that I did not use from the same package are still perfectly good. What made the carrots turn green and is it safe to eat?\nThe carrot cake is safe to eat.\u00a0 It is a natural reaction between oxygen, pigments in the carrots\u00a0and/or metal from the pan, spoon\u00a0or grater and heat from the baking process.\nMy friend keeps her margerine in the cupboard and I want to know if that is safe. Can margerine be kept at room temperature or does it have to be refridgerated?\nMargarine readily absorbs odors.\u00a0 For optimal quality, margarine should be refrigerated and used by its best before date or within 8 months unopen, 1 -3 months on opening.\nHow long do bluberries go without growing mold?\nThat would depend on the\u00a0ripeness of the blueberries when purchased.

The bakery had not refrigerated these items and were stored at room temperature - are they okay to eat?\nBoth of these products are made from perishable ingredients-dairy products and eggs and should not be left at room temperature longer than two hours (one hour in the summer) or there may be a risk of the development of harmful bacteria.\nWe purchased a package of \"No Name\" Farmers Cheese at Loblaws but inadvertently left it out of the fridge overnight. I know that 2 hours seems to be the danger point, but what if the vacuum-packed package is still unopened? Is it too risky to eat it or should we throw it out? Thank you.\nYou are correct. If cheese, sealed in a vacuum packed package is left at room temperature longer than two hours, there is a risk that it will be contaminated with harmful bacteria. It should be discarded.\nAfter eating 3/4 of a pizza pocket, I noticed that it had green and white mold in it. It did have a slightly funny taste. Should I be concerned?\nBlue, green or white molds can be harmful. Some can cause immediate illness. Others are thought to be carcinogenic. If these molds form on firm foods, they can be trimmed off removing the mold plus 2.5 cm/1 inch surrounding it. But soft foods should be discarded because the mold can travel throughout them.\nI made a sour cream frosting 2 weeks ago. I used what I needed and refrigerated the rest.

I then noticed while they were eating it that it had bits of mold in it and smelt funny. My mum said she checked the handful of cheese she used before putting it on and didnt notice any mold, is she safe?\nIt is often difficult to see mold on grated cheese. But if some of the cheese was moldy, the mold has probably traveled throughout the bag of grated cheese. Some molds contain toxins which\u00a0may cause immediate illness. Others may be carcinogenic.\nHow yogurt taste if the temperature is too high and low\nSome\u00a0factors\u00a0could influence the taste of the yogurt.\u00a0 The initial fruit flavour itself and the time of exposure to a given temperature.\u00a0 Generally, the higher the temperature is, the more flavour the yogurt would have.\u00a0 Yogurt will have an enhanced taste as its temperature gets close to room temperature and its texture would be more fluid as well.\nI just checked a package of Feta cheese @ Loeb. The expiry date was for May 2009. Is this possible? or is the date incorrect.\nIt is possible that feta cheese could keep that long because it is preserved in a brine solution with a high salt content.\u00a0 Feta cheese is often compared or called pickled cheese. The brine solution serves as a preservative along with refrigeration and that could easily explain its long shelf life.\nI ate about 1 tablespoon worth of creamy salad dressing with my supper (veal, rice, cucumber salad) that was 2 months (!) past the expiry date before noticing something was wrong. I have a minor stomach upset now but was wondering if there is any need to worry?\nThere is a possiblility that the salad dressing could be at fault (except to the fact that the quantity consumed was small) but then it could be something else.\u00a0 At this point in time, it is unlikely that something else will happen.\u00a0 Monitore yourself and if you see that the symptoms get worst, do not hesitate to consult a physician.\u00a0 Rule of thumd, expiry products should not be consumed.\nHi!\u00a0 Yesterday I purchased a Camembert on sale ($5.39 instead of $7 and some cents) in a fine store.\u00a0 When I came to eat some, it was dry and had a bad taste.\u00a0 I checked the expiry date and it was passed a month ago.\u00a0 I returned to the store for a refund but the clerks told me:\u00a0 \"Oh yeah, it was on sale because the date had passed.\u00a0 It is always like that\".\u00a0 I brought up the point about food safety but they did not say a thing.\u00a0 I told them to withdraw the product from the shelves, again nothing happened.\u00a0 It is true that I have purchased in the past Camembert from which the expiry date was closed or passed by one to two days but the cheese was strong and delicious; not dry and bitter like the one purchased yesterday.\u00a0 I want to contact the manager.\u00a0 Would you have some valid arguments to propose to tell him that it is dangerous and unacceptable to sale such products?\u00a0 And also, I ate a piece of that cheese.\u00a0 Is there a risk?\u00a0 Thank you!\nIt is not recommended to consume expired product.\u00a0 it is surprising to see a fine store selling such product knowing that it could jeopardize its reputation.\u00a0 When talking to the manager, tell him that selling expired products is dangerous as he is putting the health of his customers at risk and it is not a good business practices.\u00a0 He should ensure good rotation of the merchandise.\u00a0\u00a0You could always tell him too that if there is no action taken, you would report him to the local health authorities.\u00a0 \u00a0As for yourself, the quantity of cheese consumed should not cause any ill-effect.\u00a0 However, if you experience an adverse reaction that wanted to last for a long time, do not hesitate to consult a physician.\nI heard on the news one evening that mini carrots are processed with bleach to preserve their shelf life?? is this true?? they do turn white after cooking?? sorry if this is dumb and I got it wrong?? Judy\nCarrots are washed before being put in bags and it is possible that the water used is treated by the municipality or according to the authorities if the water come from a well.\u00a0However, Health Canada does have standard for the use of chlorine in the produce industry.\u00a0 The washed water would not be over chlorinated. As for the carrots turning white after cooking, it does not have anything to do with teh fact of being washed.\u00a0 It is the oxidation by contact with air.\nHow long can we keep cream of tartar?\nIf the cream of tartar is kept in a sealed container in a dry place, it would keep indefinitely.\nI was making yogurt for my first time yesterday, heated the milk on the stove to boiling and added some powdered milk to it. Let it cool to lukewarm and added it to the containers with a tablespoon of plain yogurt and put in the yogurt maker as per instructions. I thought the yogurt maker was working, however, realized 5 hours later that it hadn't been. I fiddled with the machine and I finally got it to start working, and an additional 5 hours later my yogurt was solidified. Is it still good to eat as the incubation period for yogurt can go as long as 10 hours?\nWhen yogurt is prepared by manufacturer, its incubation is controlled by temperature and acidity production to ensure that lactic acid bacteria are\u00a0reducing the pH thus controlling pathogens.\u00a0 In your case, the first 5 hours was not under control and you have to ask yourself what made the yogurt to become hard?\u00a0 At this time, I cannot recommend the consumption of the yogurt.\nCan we freeze fresh cream?\nYou can freeze fresh cream.\u00a0 However, when you will thaw it, you might need to mix it very well has it might have a tendency to separate.\nI see Kraft Cheese Slices on display in some grocery stores, out of refrigeration.

For how long should we keep the cream cheese when it is not opened yet.\nIt is surprising the container of cream cheese does not indicated the best before date as it should because all fod product that have a shelf life of 90 days or less should have a best before date.\u00a0 Cream cheese should keep for at least\u00a06 to 8 weeks unopened if properly refrigerated.\nWhat's happening to my cream cheese? I usually slice off a piece and put it into an air-tight container to serve. Even before the best before date I'm noticing red streaks almost mold-like on the sides of my cheese. I've never seen red mold before. Can you give me advice?\nThe red streaks could be related to the growth of yeasts more than mold.\u00a0 It might have a sweet smell when you open the container.\u00a0 Yeasts produce spores that are everywhere and wait for an opportunity such as getting\u00a0in contact with moist food and\u00a0multiply to become visible as streaks as the one you describe.\u00a0 The cream cheese got contaminated during the transfer to that air tight container.\u00a0 Note that the \"Best before date\" doesn't stand when the package has been opened.\nI have just made a cream cheese frosting with Philadelphia and butter and powdered sugar.\u00a0 I noticed the unopened cream cheese was past its date it says 3rd June when its now 21st June. Should we eat it, it was only purchased this morning?\nIt is not recommend to consume product that have passed their expiry date.\u00a0 It is not to say that the product might be hazardous to consume.\u00a0 It might be a problem of\u00a0quality and this is what manufacturers will be able to guarantee that quality and wholesomeness throughout it shelflife.\u00a0 After teh expiry date, this guarantee is gone.\nI bought an odwalla protein drink. When I opened it, there was green and black slimy stuff around the mouth. What was that and was the drink drinkable?\nWhat you described here seems to be a spoiled product that should not be consumed if you can determine that it is not the proper normal appearance of this drink.\u00a0 Was the bottle properly sealed?\u00a0 Was there some sort of a tamper evident seal around the cap or a pull tab on the opening?\u00a0 How about an expiry date?\u00a0 Return the product to the store or throw it out.\u00a0 Do not consume.\nI am 13 weeks pregnant and have eating fresh parmesan cheese which have just found out is made with unpasturised milk. Will I have a high risk of catching Listeria?\nParmesan cheese is known to not been able to support the growth of Listeria as it is considered an aged old cheese that is pretty dried and acidic.\u00a0 You could discuss the matter with your doctor if you want but I would say that you would be at greater risks if you were eating soft and semi-soft non pasteurized cheeses or alfalfa sprouts over the parmesan cheese.\u00a0 You should be fine.\nCan expired pancake and waffle mix make you sick?\nPancake and waffle mixes are dried powdered products that could hardly make someone sick.\u00a0 However, if the mixes got hold of some humidity by not being preserved adequately, mold could grow and produce toxins that could make someone sick with time by being exposed to it.\u00a0\u00a0The other cause of illness that could occur would be\u00a0rancidity as the\u00a0taste of the product\u00a0changes with time.\nHi Mrs. Cookwell!\u00a0 I bought some small swiss cakes and today, i pull them out to eat some.\u00a0 I noticed that the best before date has passed 5 days ago.\u00a0 Is there a risk to eat them?\nIt is not recommended to eat products that have passed their best before date.\u00a0 Even if the small swiss cakes might not be a health hazard as such, they might have lost their quality and freshness and could become rancid with time.\ni left an unopened container (48 oz) of ranch dip in the living room for 3 hours.the house has A/C is it ok?\nIf the unopened ranch dip\u00a0was purchased at\u00a0room temperature it would be fine.\u00a0 Otherwise, there could be a need to keep the product refrigerated at all time.\u00a0 Consult the labal and follow the instructions.\nDear Mrs Cookwell, it may seem a silly question but can you tell me if botulinum can grow into plain yogurt? Many thanks!\nThere aren't any questions that are silly.\u00a0 It will be hard not to say impossible for botulism to grow in plain yogurt for several reasons.\u00a0 First of all refrigeration will be a factor controlling the growth of botulism bacteria.\u00a0 The acidity of the yogurt will not promote the growth of the yogurt as well and the presence of oxygen will not allow its growth as Clostridium botulinum is a strict anaerobe.\u00a0 So putting all those factors together, it is impossible for botulism to growth.\u00a0 On top of everything, you have competition with all the other cultures added to the milk to make the yogurt.\nHi!\u00a0 Can we eat raclette cheese that has been frozen for 4 years?\u00a0 Thanks!\nWhen it comes to food safety, there should not be any problems consuming the raclette cheese frozen for 4 years.\u00a0 As for its quality however, it could be another story.\u00a0 The cheese would have been abused by the freezing temperature.\u00a0 Its texture and taste might be quite different now.\u00a0 If you still want to use it make sure to thaw it in the refrigerator.\nis it alright to eat muffins that are old, but still look desent? or will you get sick?\nIt depends how old they are and what they look like.\u00a0 Usually it is not recommended to eat product that have expired unless they have been preserved differently such as freezing.\u00a0 Muffins usually will have mold growing on them unless they got very dried.\u00a0 They may not make your sick but their nutritional value will be questionable.\u00a0 Why eat them if they do not bring you anything good?\nForgot to bring in all the groceries and left overnight in the car (about 20hrs to be exact) a large container of cottage cheese, yoghurt, and heavy whipped cream in an aerosol can. All containers were slightly warm to the touch. Can I use these products safely for baking? I live in Florida and outside temp was in the 80's overnight. Thanks\nThose perishable foods have spent to much time at very warm temperature.\u00a0 Cottage cheese and yogurt should be definitely thrown out as culture have probably\u00a0outgrown the product rendering them unpalatable.\u00a0 As for the heavy whipped cream in an aerosol can, read what the label recommends.\u00a0 If it needs to be refrigerated at all time, then, you might\u00a0have to throw out that one too.\nI left a store bought cake with whipped frosting and a strawberry mousse filling unrefrigerated for twelve hours...can i still eat it?\nI depends if the ingredients of the frosting and the mousse.\u00a0 If the cake was purchased from a refrigerated counter, it should have been refrigerated upon arrival at home.\u00a0 Twelve hours without refrigeration might be quite a long time.\u00a0 At\u00a0this time, I could not recommend its consumption.\nIf i marinade some chicken in yoghurt, chilies and spices can i freeze it and for how long, thanks\nAs long as you have marinated the chicken in the refrigerator at all time , it will be safe to freeze it.\u00a0 Once frozen, il will keep that way for 2 to 3 months.\nMy daughter had some cream cheese on a sandwhich at a friends house. They realized after she ate the sandwhich the cream cheese had expired months ago. This was a couple weeks ago and she seems fine. Would she have already gotten sick if she was going to have a reaction to spoiled cream cheese?\nIt has been two weeks since she ate the expired cream cheese!\u00a0 Her chances of getting sick as very low and will eventually dissapear as time goes by.\u00a0 It is never recommended to eat expired product as it looses its quality and nutritional values not to mention chances of bacterial and or mold contamination.\nKind of worried. We had a power outage. During the day we ran a generator to keep our refrigerator cold, at night we shut it off for about 6-8 hours to sleep, turned the generator back on in the am.(fear of fire). We have eaten the eggs,ranch dressing, and lunch meat,then heard it should have been thrown out after two hours?? How soon would symptoms of food poisoning show up? Do you think we should be concerned??\nI would not think that you should be concerned unless you really think that the food you mentioned was at room temperature for more than two hours.\u00a0 Once you stopped the refrigerator for the night, if its door stayed shut, the temperature inside did probably go above 4 degrees C (40 degrees F) but it surely did not reach 10, 15, 20 or 22 degrees C (50, 60, 68 or 72 degrees F) during the night until you started back the generator.\u00a0 As to answer your question about food poisoning symptoms, they could appear anywhere between 2 to 4\u00a0hours\u00a0to a week or more after consumption of contaminated food but in your case, I would not worry too much about that.\u00a0 I hope that you have recovered your power.\nI have miracle whip in the refrigerator that expired in May of 2008. Is it still good or should I throw it away?\nIt is never recommended to consume product where their expired date has passed.\u00a0 It is not to say that you will necessarily be sick because of that.\u00a0 There could just be some quality issue where the food could not be as nutritious ans wholesome as it was initially.\nHi! Can you freeze cream cheese? I accidently froze a pkge at the back of my fridge and now as I'm about to use it the texture is more chunky then creamy. Is it still safe to use?\nThe cream cheese is not a food commodity that someone would put in the freezer to preserve it.\u00a0 However if it froze as in your case, the texture might change but It would still be\u00a0safe to use and might blend better if\u00a0use in a recipe.\nCan you freeze fresh mozzarella balls (the large ones?) Thank you.\nMozzarella balls will freeze but once thawed, its quality and texture might be different.\nDoes Heat preserving plastic Lunch box cause cancer. Last week i replace my stainless steel lunch box to Cello Lunch box, as my food is losing heat in steel lunch box. the shop owner says (cello) is safe it has foodgrade sign in it.one logo is in it like heat and fork..Please give me a good answer...\nIf the cello lunch box is labelled as food grade, the shop owner should be right.\u00a0 To put such a label, the manufacturer would have to have proof on hand that it is safe to hold food.\u00a0 If there is anyway that you could get hold of the manufacturer, I would suggest to contact them and get more information about the product.\nI ate some pasteurized cheese that had expired six months ago while I am 5 months pregnant.\u00a0 Is there any risks?\nIt depends of the type of cheese and the way it has been handled during that expired period.\u00a0 You should not have any problems unless the cheese had been temerature abused and that it has been contaminated with Listeria during that expired time.\nis it safe to use heavy whipping cream after 1 month expiration date it has never been opened.

As long as it is unopened, is it ok to keep it to eat up to this useby date, or is there a rule that it needs to be consumed within a certain amount of time once purchased and put in my fridge? Thank you!\nThe cheese should last until that time if it is unopened and refrigerated at all time.\u00a0 Once the package is opened, the use by date does not apply anymore.\u00a0 The manufacturer must have conduct market test to ensure that is product is safe until that time if unopened.\nI was given a large bag of shredded cheddar. I should have frozen half, but did not. I now see a bit of mold, here and there. Any suggestions?\nOn shredded cheddar, it would be so hard to remove the mold that you can see here and there without contaminating the rest of the cheese.\u00a0 It is not like in a block where you can cut off the contaminated area and salvage the rest.\u00a0 On the shredded, the growth must be all over and I am afraid that will not have any other choice than to throw it out.\nI work in a day care. We usually eat morning snack between 8:00-8:45. Our cook brings out our cart with our food and milk around 7:30 sometimes earlier. We were wondering how long milk can sit out for? Also, is it safe to put tinfoil over top of muffins or food that should be cooled before it is cooled?\nMilk should be kept refrigerated until ready to be served especially when it is served to young children; one of the groups considered vulnerable to food poisoning.\u00a0 It is a risky practice for a day care\u00a0that could have tragic consequences.\u00a0 Why\u00a0is there a need to cover relatively dry foods such as muffins if they are served shortly after being prepared? If there is a need, do not used tinfoil.\nI forgot the eggs in the back seat of the car for two days. Are they safe to eat?\nNot at all.\u00a0 Those eggs are no good anymore and could be very dangerous to consume.\u00a0 They have spent to much time in the danger zone (over two hours above 4 degrees C (40 degrees F)) where bacteria thrive and cause food poisoning by producing heat resistant toxins.\ni made yogurt by boiling 3.25% milk, cooling it to body temperature, added some store bought yogurt and let it sit for 8 hrs before refrigerating. i found a ton of pink/brown spots ONLY on the bottom surface - no where else. does the whole thing have to be thrown out? is it a yeast contamination? can i just leave off the bottom part?\nIt looks like that your yogurt has been contaminated either by mold or\u00a0yeasts and I would recommended that you throw everything away.\u00a0 It is probably only the tip fo the iceberg that you are seeing there, they are probably all over the yogurt.\nCan butter and margarine be left out overnight for use the next day?

Some molds cause spoilage by growing on the surface of cheese. They produce streaks of discoloration, clumps of blue, green or white fuzzy looking growths \u2013 these molds are bad and unsafe to eat! \u2022 If mold forms on hard or firm cheese (e.g., cheddar, parmesan), generously trim off mold plus 2.5 cm (1 inch) of cheese surrounding it (be careful to keep your knife clean of mold); wrap the trimmed cheese in new wax/plastic wrap and refrigerate. \u2022 Discard fresh cheese, soft cheese (e.g., feta, brie, camembert) and processed cheese that is moldy. It is difficult to judge how far the mold has penetrated \u2013 so do not keep it, or eat it. To prevent mold growth on cheese, refrigerate cheese sealed in its original packaging, until ready to use. Once opened, wrap the cheese tightly in waxed paper or plastic wrap and keep refrigerated. If moisture has condensed on the cheese, wipe it off with a clean paper towel before rewrapping.\nI left some cottage cheese out for 3 hours. Is it safe to eat?\nNo, it is not safe to eat.

I've noticed, for example, that the mold that grows on parmesan and padano cheese (especially if it's already grated) smells and tastes like gorgonzola. Thank you!\nThe molds that are used in the production of cheeses like Blue, Gorgonzola, Stilton, etc. are specially cultured molds, done so in a controlled environment. Unfortunately, our refridgerators is not one of those controlled environments and the molds that we might find on cheeses in our fridge are causing spoilage of the cheese, not adding flavor. These molds are unsafe to eat and may be producing poisons called mycotoxins which become part of the food and are not destroyed by cooking.\nIf mold is on a hard cheese such as cheddar, it can be cut away plus one inch of cheese surrounding it. If mold is growing on a fresh\u00a0cheese like cream cheese, cottage cheese\u00a0or on soft cheese such as Brie, discard it.\nI purchased some precrumble blue cheese at a big box store. I opened it to use and one week later I looked and there was mold all over it. It has been refrigerated the whole time and is not even near it's date.

For some reason, it has been contaminated with mold spores and these do grow slowly at refrigeration temperatures. Wrap the cheese well and discard. Cooking it will not make it safe.\nI\u00a0have had had cream cheese in my fridge since April and it is now September.

It is made with canned milk. I usually heat it up before I put it in his thermos. I pour hot water into his thermos first to heat it up like the directions say, but my sister told me it was unsafe for him to take this in his lunch. She also told me it is unsafe to send him hot chocolate in his thermos because I make our hot chocolate with milk and hersheys syrup. Could you please tell me if this is okay or not? We use a crayola thermos for kids thanks for your time Tammi and Alex\nYour sister may be right. This may not be safe if the food in the thermos does not stay piping hot 74C/165F. You can test that. Prepare your thermos as you would nomally do and fill with rice as warm as normal. Let stand\u00a0the amount of time before eaten by your son then measure the temperature of the rice with a food thermometer. It should be the above temperature. Then run the\u00a0same test with hot chocolate. Of course, any leftovers\u00a0brought home from school should be discarded.\nI have packages of danish brie and danish camembert - but they expired over a year ago - the package has never been opened - still looks fine when i opened it - is it still safe to eat?\nYou cannot see contamination with harmful bacteria or some types of spoilage.

Many thanks!\nThere aren't any questions that are silly.\u00a0 It will be hard not to say impossible for botulism to grow in plain yogurt for several reasons.\u00a0 First of all refrigeration will be a factor controlling the growth of botulism bacteria.\u00a0 The acidity of the yogurt will not promote the growth of the yogurt as well and the presence of oxygen will not allow its growth as Clostridium botulinum is a strict anaerobe.\u00a0 So putting all those factors together, it is impossible for botulism to growth.\u00a0 On top of everything, you have competition with all the other cultures added to the milk to make the yogurt.\nHi!\u00a0 Can we eat raclette cheese that has been frozen for 4 years?\u00a0 Thanks!\nWhen it comes to food safety, there should not be any problems consuming the raclette cheese frozen for 4 years.\u00a0 As for its quality however, it could be another story.\u00a0 The cheese would have been abused by the freezing temperature.\u00a0 Its texture and taste might be quite different now.\u00a0 If you still want to use it make sure to thaw it in the refrigerator.\nis it alright to eat muffins that are old, but still look desent? or will you get sick?\nIt depends how old they are and what they look like.\u00a0 Usually it is not recommended to eat product that have expired unless they have been preserved differently such as freezing.\u00a0 Muffins usually will have mold growing on them unless they got very dried.\u00a0 They may not make your sick but their nutritional value will be questionable.\u00a0 Why eat them if they do not bring you anything good?\nForgot to bring in all the groceries and left overnight in the car (about 20hrs to be exact) a large container of cottage cheese, yoghurt, and heavy whipped cream in an aerosol can. All containers were slightly warm to the touch. Can I use these products safely for baking? I live in Florida and outside temp was in the 80's overnight. Thanks\nThose perishable foods have spent to much time at very warm temperature.\u00a0 Cottage cheese and yogurt should be definitely thrown out as culture have probably\u00a0outgrown the product rendering them unpalatable.\u00a0 As for the heavy whipped cream in an aerosol can, read what the label recommends.\u00a0 If it needs to be refrigerated at all time, then, you might\u00a0have to throw out that one too.\nI left a store bought cake with whipped frosting and a strawberry mousse filling unrefrigerated for twelve hours...can i still eat it?\nI depends if the ingredients of the frosting and the mousse.\u00a0 If the cake was purchased from a refrigerated counter, it should have been refrigerated upon arrival at home.\u00a0 Twelve hours without refrigeration might be quite a long time.\u00a0 At\u00a0this time, I could not recommend its consumption.\nIf i marinade some chicken in yoghurt, chilies and spices can i freeze it and for how long, thanks\nAs long as you have marinated the chicken in the refrigerator at all time , it will be safe to freeze it.\u00a0 Once frozen, il will keep that way for 2 to 3 months.\nMy daughter had some cream cheese on a sandwhich at a friends house. They realized after she ate the sandwhich the cream cheese had expired months ago. This was a couple weeks ago and she seems fine. Would she have already gotten sick if she was going to have a reaction to spoiled cream cheese?\nIt has been two weeks since she ate the expired cream cheese!\u00a0 Her chances of getting sick as very low and will eventually dissapear as time goes by.\u00a0 It is never recommended to eat expired product as it looses its quality and nutritional values not to mention chances of bacterial and or mold contamination.\nKind of worried. We had a power outage. During the day we ran a generator to keep our refrigerator cold, at night we shut it off for about 6-8 hours to sleep, turned the generator back on in the am.(fear of fire). We have eaten the eggs,ranch dressing, and lunch meat,then heard it should have been thrown out after two hours?? How soon would symptoms of food poisoning show up? Do you think we should be concerned??\nI would not think that you should be concerned unless you really think that the food you mentioned was at room temperature for more than two hours.\u00a0 Once you stopped the refrigerator for the night, if its door stayed shut, the temperature inside did probably go above 4 degrees C (40 degrees F) but it surely did not reach 10, 15, 20 or 22 degrees C (50, 60, 68 or 72 degrees F) during the night until you started back the generator.\u00a0 As to answer your question about food poisoning symptoms, they could appear anywhere between 2 to 4\u00a0hours\u00a0to a week or more after consumption of contaminated food but in your case, I would not worry too much about that.\u00a0 I hope that you have recovered your power.\nI have miracle whip in the refrigerator that expired in May of 2008. Is it still good or should I throw it away?\nIt is never recommended to consume product where their expired date has passed.\u00a0 It is not to say that you will necessarily be sick because of that.\u00a0 There could just be some quality issue where the food could not be as nutritious ans wholesome as it was initially.\nHi! Can you freeze cream cheese? I accidently froze a pkge at the back of my fridge and now as I'm about to use it the texture is more chunky then creamy. Is it still safe to use?\nThe cream cheese is not a food commodity that someone would put in the freezer to preserve it.\u00a0 However if it froze as in your case, the texture might change but It would still be\u00a0safe to use and might blend better if\u00a0use in a recipe.\nCan you freeze fresh mozzarella balls (the large ones?) Thank you.\nMozzarella balls will freeze but once thawed, its quality and texture might be different.\nDoes Heat preserving plastic Lunch box cause cancer. Last week i replace my stainless steel lunch box to Cello Lunch box, as my food is losing heat in steel lunch box. the shop owner says (cello) is safe it has foodgrade sign in it.one logo is in it like heat and fork..Please give me a good answer...\nIf the cello lunch box is labelled as food grade, the shop owner should be right.\u00a0 To put such a label, the manufacturer would have to have proof on hand that it is safe to hold food.\u00a0 If there is anyway that you could get hold of the manufacturer, I would suggest to contact them and get more information about the product.\nI ate some pasteurized cheese that had expired six months ago while I am 5 months pregnant.\u00a0 Is there any risks?\nIt depends of the type of cheese and the way it has been handled during that expired period.\u00a0 You should not have any problems unless the cheese had been temerature abused and that it has been contaminated with Listeria during that expired time.\nis it safe to use heavy whipping cream after 1 month expiration date it has never been opened. I opened one and it doen't smell or look bad\nIt is not recommended to use product that has been expired due to lost of quality and risk of food poisoning.\u00a0 Harmful bacteria do not give food a bad smell of a bad look but can still be present.\nI purchased some pastry filling cream cheese in a 2 lb plastic bag that was not refrigerated but states it needs to be refrigerated after opening. I want to use it between layers of a wedding cake but the cake may sit for 4-6 hours or more at room temperature at the reception. Will the cream cheese inside the cake still be okay to eat?\nThat period of time might be a little bit too long for comfort especially for a wedding cake with cream cheese that would be served to a lot of people of all ages.\u00a0 It could be risky and I am surely not willing to commit myself and encourage you to keep it for more than two hours at room temperature.\u00a0 You should find a way to refrigerate the cake and shortened the time exposed at room temperature.\nIs it safe to eat cold pizza left out of the refrigerator?\nAbsolutely not safe to eat pizza left out of the refrigerator especially if it has been left at room temperature for more than an hour (two hours in the winter months). It should be thrown out.\nIs it safe to use concentrated artificial (synthetic)fruit flavors after expiry date?\nIt is never recommended to use a product from which its expiry date is already gone by.\u00a0 In this cas there could be a chemical breakdown that could affect the taste of the finished product.\nHello. I have a pack of unopened sliced swiss cows milk Jarlsberg cheese with a useby date of 2009. As long as it is unopened, is it ok to keep it to eat up to this useby date, or is there a rule that it needs to be consumed within a certain amount of time once purchased and put in my fridge? Thank you!\nThe cheese should last until that time if it is unopened and refrigerated at all time.\u00a0 Once the package is opened, the use by date does not apply anymore.\u00a0 The manufacturer must have conduct market test to ensure that is product is safe until that time if unopened.\nI was given a large bag of shredded cheddar. I should have frozen half, but did not. I now see a bit of mold, here and there. Any suggestions?\nOn shredded cheddar, it would be so hard to remove the mold that you can see here and there without contaminating the rest of the cheese.\u00a0 It is not like in a block where you can cut off the contaminated area and salvage the rest.\u00a0 On the shredded, the growth must be all over and I am afraid that will not have any other choice than to throw it out.\nI work in a day care. We usually eat morning snack between 8:00-8:45. Our cook brings out our cart with our food and milk around 7:30 sometimes earlier. We were wondering how long milk can sit out for? Also, is it safe to put tinfoil over top of muffins or food that should be cooled before it is cooled?\nMilk should be kept refrigerated until ready to be served especially when it is served to young children; one of the groups considered vulnerable to food poisoning.\u00a0 It is a risky practice for a day care\u00a0that could have tragic consequences.\u00a0 Why\u00a0is there a need to cover relatively dry foods such as muffins if they are served shortly after being prepared? If there is a need, do not used tinfoil.\nI forgot the eggs in the back seat of the car for two days. Are they safe to eat?\nNot at all.\u00a0 Those eggs are no good anymore and could be very dangerous to consume.\u00a0 They have spent to much time in the danger zone (over two hours above 4 degrees C (40 degrees F)) where bacteria thrive and cause food poisoning by producing heat resistant toxins.\ni made yogurt by boiling 3.25% milk, cooling it to body temperature, added some store bought yogurt and let it sit for 8 hrs before refrigerating. i found a ton of pink/brown spots ONLY on the bottom surface - no where else. does the whole thing have to be thrown out? is it a yeast contamination? can i just leave off the bottom part?\nIt looks like that your yogurt has been contaminated either by mold or\u00a0yeasts and I would recommended that you throw everything away.\u00a0 It is probably only the tip fo the iceberg that you are seeing there, they are probably all over the yogurt.\nCan butter and margarine be left out overnight for use the next day? How about eggs?\nButter and margarine can be left out overnight without refrigeration.\u00a0 Those two commodities have very low water activity where bacteria could not growth immediately.\u00a0 With time, they can become rancid at room temperature.\u00a0 As for eggs, they need to be kept refrigerated at all time as bacterial ovarian transfer can occur from the hen to the egg where the importance of refrigeration.\nwe just purchased one and one half lb.packages of extra sharp chedar cheese and would like to know your advise about packaging for mailing! thank you\nYou do not specify how long the mailing trip will take and if it is staying in its original country.\u00a0 Exportation of foods in other country could be prohibited for sanitary reasons.\u00a0 Extra sharp cheddar cheese is quite a dry hard cheese.\u00a0 If you can wrap it tight in a styrofoam container with ice pack, it should make it at its destination in two to three days.\nI accidently put a container of french onion dip in the freezer. I realized it about a few days later. It thawed out but looks like little curds. it is still good to eat.\nIt should still be good to eat.\u00a0 You might need to mix it well before using it.\u00a0 Freezing that product make ingredient to separate as it is happening now.\nCan't find an answer to your question?\n\u00a9 Canadian Partnership for Consumer Food Safety Education.

Here are some of the most frequently asked questions from our readers, along with my answers.\nWhy focus on raw milk? What about other foods that have made people sick?\nWe get a lot of questions from people who are trying to decide whether or not to drink raw milk, and we want to provide them with science-based information on the risks of drinking raw milk.\u00c2\nI work with the group at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that investigates outbreaks of foodborne illnesses caused by germs like Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 (a dangerous form of E. coli). Over the years, we have collected extensive data based on experience investigating these outbreaks. Many different foods have been associated with recent outbreaks, such as unpasteurized juice and cider , eggs , and sprouts .\nWhen determining if one food is riskier than another, it is important to understand how many people consume that food. For example, did you know that an estimated 4 percent of dairy products consumed in the United States are unpasteurized, based on a 2006-2007 FoodNet Population Survey, yet more than half of dairy-associated outbreaks are linked to raw milk products?\nI know people who have been drinking raw milk for years, and it\u2019s never made them sick. Why is that?\nSeveral things can affect whether or not a person becomes sick after consuming a contaminated food or drink. These include the number and type of germs contaminating the food or drink, as well as the immune defenses of the person who consumes the food or drink.\nThe presence of germs in raw milk is unpredictable. The number of disease-causing germs in the raw milk may be too low to make a person sick at first, but the germs may later multiply so that there are enough to make the same person seriously ill. As seen in these videos , for some people, drinking contaminated raw milk just once could make them really sick; for others, illness comes after years of drinking raw milk.\nI\u2019ve heard that raw milk has enzymes that kill dangerous bacteria. Is that true?\nNo, the enzymes in raw milk are not strong enough to kill dangerous bacteria. In the United States, pasteurization is the only method routinely used to eliminate disease-causing organisms in milk.\nMy farmer has set up humane and sanitary conditions for raising his animals and producing raw milk. His animals are really healthy. Doesn\u2019t this ensure that his milk is safe?\nEven animals that appear healthy and clean may carry germs that can contaminate milk. Adhering to good hygienic practices during milking can reduce the risk of contaminating the milk, but it doesn\u2019t eliminate it. If the milk is raw, small numbers of bacteria might multiply and grow in the milk before someone drinks it. No matter what precautions the farmer takes, it\u2019s impossible to guarantee that raw milk is free of harmful germs.\nWhat about raw milk that\u2019s been laboratory tested for bacteria?\nNegative tests do not guarantee that raw milk is safe to drink. People have become very sick from drinking raw milk that came from farms that regularly tested their milk for bacteria, and whose owners were sure that their milk was safe.\nWhat are the statistics on outbreaks of illness related to raw milk?\nAmong dairy product-associated outbreaks reported to CDC between 1973 and 2009 in which the investigators reported whether the product was pasteurized or raw, 82% were due to raw milk or cheese. From 1998 through 2009, 93 outbreaks due to consumption of raw milk or raw milk products were reported to CDC. These resulted in 1,837 illnesses, 195 hospitalizations, and 2 deaths. Most of these illnesses were caused by Escherichia coli O157, Campylobacter, or Salmonella. It is important to note that a substantial proportion of the raw milk-associated disease burden falls on children; among the 93 raw dairy product outbreaks from 1998 to 2009, 79% involved at least one person less than 20 years old.\nReported outbreaks represent the tip of the iceberg. For every outbreak and every illness reported, many others occur, and most illnesses are not part of recognized outbreaks.\nKeep in mind that reported outbreaks represent the tip of the iceberg . For every outbreak and every illness reported, many others occur, and most illnesses are not part of recognized outbreaks.\nCan outbreaks be caused by pasteurized milk products?\nPasteurized milk and cheese products can cause outbreaks, but these are usually due to contamination that occurs after the pasteurization process. Also, the most common germ that affects pasteurized milk products is norovirus , which is typically spread from one person to another, not from animals to people. This is different from the germs that can most often contaminate raw milk like Salmonella and E. coli O157 H7, which are spread from animals to people. Also illness from norovirus typically lasts for only 2 days, whereas illness from Salmonella and E. coli is usually more serious.\nFor more statistics and other information, see Raw Milk Questions and Answers .\nUpdated on: November 18, 2011\n"}, {"score": 345.7315, "uuid": "be1608da-363e-5da0-b57a-2fef7565c29a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0910wb-63-15495", "target_hostname": "foodsafety.gov", "target_uri": "http://foodsafety.gov/blog/raw_milk_details.html", "page_rank": 1.1716556e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Drinking Raw Milk: More Details on the Risks | FoodSafety.gov", "snippet": "Can outbreaks be caused by <em>pasteurized</em> milk products? <em>Pasteurized</em> milk and <em>cheese</em> products can cause outbreaks, but these are usually due to contamination that occurs after the pasteurization process.", "explanation": null, "document": "Posted February 28, 2011 | Read 6 comments\nBy LCDR Casey Barton Behravesh, DVM, DrPH, US Public Health Service\nIn response to my recent blog, Drinking Raw Milk: It\u2019s Not Worth the Risk , we received a number of questions.

It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or New Year\u2019s Day. The cows need milking. And nobody knows that better than the folks at The Farmer\u2019s Cow.\nphoto c/o The Farmer's Cow\nA group of six Connecticut family-owned farms teamed up to provide milk to Connecticut and parts of New York and Massachusetts. Combined, they milk 2,300 cows on nearly 7,000 acres of land. Their collaboration has been so successful that they\u2019ve branched out into other products like eggs, half and half, and cider. Now they even offer heavy cream. And with the holidays coming up, it\u2019s none too soon.\nThe Unquowa School in Fairfield got the jump on the heavy cream this year, too. They made a Thanksgiving meal made in part by the product\u2019s debut. \u201cUnquowa has been with us since Day One,\u201d said Robin Chesmer, Managing Director at Farmer\u2019s Cow. \u201cThey buy our milk because they liked our concept.\u201d\nLook for The Farmer's Cow's latest product release - heavy cream\nAnd they\u2019re not stopping with just heavy cream. The company is looking to expand their product line to include ice cream. They are planning for an April launch of six flavors. Besides the ubiquitous chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, they\u2019re planning on including other popular flavors like chocolate mint chip and cookies and cream.\nWhen asked if they were planning on selling butter any time soon, Chesmer replied they like to build their clientele base with each new product first before they move on to a new one. \u201cNo butter yet, but there has been a lot of interest,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery product is an investment.\u201d\nThe four-year-old corporation boasts its local heritage and its hormone-free approach to dairy farming. On their website, they will gladly tell you that in a sing-song cadence \u00e0 la The House That Jack Built: \u201cWe are the farmers who works the land and grow the crops to feed the cows that give the milk for you to enjoy.\u201d They even have a cute commercial jingle, although I wouldn\u2019t put it on your iPod.\nTheir happy-go-lucky attitude makes it all sound so easy. But that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. In Connecticut alone, farmland has disappeared at a rapid pace. According to a poll published in The Norwich Bulletin on July 20th , the number of farms have dropped from about 500 in 1990 to 151 in 2007. And much of our $2 billion agriculture industry in this state includes dairy farms.\nThat number is even lower in other states like New Jersey. According to an article in The New York Times on November 16th , there are less than 100 farms in the state. For those states where it is not illegal, dairy farmers are trying to sell their milk \u201craw\u201d, or unpasteurized, because each bottle can fetch up to as much as $7 per bottle. A gallon of milk in New Jersey sells for $1.11. Unfortunately for many dairy farmers in the state, New Jersey does not allow the sale of unpasteurized milk.\nIf you are interested in raw milk, it is available in parts of California, Connecticut, and New Mexico. RealMilk.org gives a listing of unaltered dairy products including cheese and yogurt.\nConsumers can buy local milk at retail to support the few remaining dairy farms in CT, photo c/o The Farmer's Cow\nThe Farmer\u2019s Cow uses what they call \u201ctraditional pasteurizing.\u201d They heat the liquid to 165 degrees, which effectively kills the bacteria. The milk you typically find on the supermarket shelf is \u201cultra-pasteurized.\u201d That means the liquid has been heated to well over 200 degrees. It gives the milk a longer shelf-life, which retailers love. But The Farmer\u2019s Cow believes it takes away from the overall taste.\n\u201cIt takes the milk out of the milk,\u201d said Chesmer. \u201cIt takes away from the flavor and the goodness of what milk is all about.\u201d\nWhile taste is one of their primary concerns, they also take other things very seriously. They strive to be energy efficient with all of the equipment they use. The cows\u2019 manure is recycled and used to fertilize the grass and corn the cows are fed. They are conscious of their soil and water quality. But most importantly, each of the farms in the conglomerate is very focused on preserving the land and wildlife habitat.\n\u201cWe need to preserve it for future generations,\u201d said Chesmer. These farmers work to keep the land they produce from in tact. Like a popular bumper sticker says: No Farm. No Food. He went on to say that The Farmer\u2019s Cow offers farm tours. Chesmer said what was special about that is \u201cnot many people get the chance to visit what they eat.\u201d\nOn their web site, the company lists where consumers can buy their products. Farmer\u2019s Cow is available locally in Westport at A&J\u2019s Farmstand, Whole Foods Market, and The Fresh Market, which recently opened in October. In Fairfield, Shaw\u2019s on Black Rock Turnpike and Stop & Shop on Kings Highway Cutoff carry the milk. You can also find it at Stop & Shop\u2019s Bridgeport location on North Main Street.

His topic was The Great Online Beer & Cheese-Off .\nI\u2019ve been to many cheese and beer tastings, whether part of a structured dinner or a separate dedicated cheese event. In almost every case, whoever put on the tasting chose the beer and the cheese. If you\u2019ve done likewise, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve had the same experience. Some pairings work, others don\u2019t. Whichever way it goes, you usually only get one shot at it, that is just one cheese paired with one beer. But finding that divine pairing always made the effort worthwhile because when it works, boy does it ever. A perfect pairing of cheese and beer is practically spiritual. At least to me, but as I say; I love cheese.\nSo I was thrilled when someone figured out another way to sample cheese and beer. During the first SF Beer Week three years ago, Vic Kralj \u2014 who owns The Bistro in Hayward \u2014 hosted a different kind of cheese and beer event: the \u201ccheese-off.\u201d What Vic did was pick five cheeses and then invited five breweries to play along. Each brewery took the five cheeses and paired each with one of their beers.\nOn the night of the event, attendees got a plate of each cheese, in turn, along with the five beers (one chosen by each of the five breweries). You then tried each beer with the cheese and then picked the pairing you thought worked best.\nThat brings us back to Session #51, and the topic of cheese and beer. Below are three cheeses. I chose ones that I believe are available throughout the U.S. and quite possibly beyond our shores. And they all sell via mail order, too. So pick up some of each, or if you can\u2019t find those specific cheeses, choose similar ones.\nMaytag Blue , or another blue cheese.\nWidmer Cellars 1-yr old aged cheddar, or another aged cheddar.\nHumboldt Fog , or another goat cheese.\nPick a few beers you think will pair well with each cheese.\u00a0Drink them with the cheese.\u00a0Write up your results and post them on or before Friday, May 6.Leave a comment here , the announcement , or send me an e-mail so I can find your Session post.\nI've done this many times for others, personally selecting the combinations, and, as Jay noted, insisting, but with enthusiasm, that the pairings 'worked.' Why not have my pre-&-post-conceptions organoletically tested? I was game!\nTHE BEERS\nFor the venue, I chose Arrowine , a wine, beer, cheese, and charcuterie shop, in Arlington, Virginia.\u00a0I asked Jesse Ploeg \u2014the shop's beer buyer\u2014 to choose five beers. My only stipulations were that a dark beer and a saison be two of the five. And, not as a stipulation, but as a request, I asked that at least one be a local beer (for freshness of flavor) and that one be a beer that the store purchased from me (as a representative of Select Wines, Inc. ).\nHere are the five beers he selected, and his tasting notes:\nThe Public Pale Ale, from DC Brau of Washington, D.C.\nDC Brau is the first production brewery to open in Washington DC since 1956. The Public Pale ale is its inaugural brew.\nPours a nice orange color with a thick white head and some good spotty lacing as it makes its way down the glass.The nose is pretty hoppy with a bit of malt undertone. A good bit of pine, floral, and citrus hops. The flavor is along the same lines.\nDubbel Cannon, from Heavy Seas Brewing , of Baltimore, Maryland.\nA Belgian-style IPA. Pour is a goldish-copper color with a white head and a ring of lacing down the glass. The nose and flavor brought floral/spicy hops, spicy Belgian yeast, and stone fruits. Zesty with medium mouthfeel. Hop presence gives way to fruit and spicy yeast. 7.25% abv.\nMoo Thunder Stout from Butternuts Beer & Ale , of Garratsville, New York.\nA 'milk' stout, brewed with lactose. Pours a rich, opaque black with dark brown edges and a creamy tan head. Soft aroma and flavor: malty with some roastiness, dark chocolate, and a hint of milk. Lighter side of the Stout Ale spectrum, without being water. Edges have a slight roasty bite, smoothed with chocolate, earth, toasted bread, slightly sweet. Finishes dry and fast. 4.9% abv.\nSaison de Lente from The Bruery , of Orange County, California.\nCloudy, bright gold, with a large head of foam. Aromas and flavors of toasty yeast, warm spice, lemon, mowed grass, and pepper. Medium mouthfeel, lots of carbonation, slightly tart, and a long finish. 6.5% abv.\nTrappiste Rochefort 10 from Abbey of Notre-Dame de Saint-R\u00e9my , in Belgium. The abbey was founded in 1230, and the monks began to brew beer sometime around 1595. The small brewery in the abbey, Rochefort Trappiste, is one of only seven Trappist breweries in the world.\nDeep brown with a off-white creamy head. An aroma of spice, alcohol, raisin, plum, and ripe melon. A sensation of alcoholic warming is evident on the palate, with flavors of ripe plum pudding, peppermint, and white pepper. 11.3% ABV\nTHE CHEESES\nThen, I decided to mix things up a bit. I asked Katie Carter\u00a0\u2014a cheesemonger at the store, and a soon-to-be cheesemaker in her own right ( Afina Cheese )\u2014\u00a0to select three cheeses other than those Jay had suggested. Not there there was anything wrong with his trio \u2014 Humboldt Fog is a personal favorite of mine\u2014\u00a0but, just as with craft and imported beers, there is a trove of wonderful cheeses locally-fermented, and imported, now available in the US.\nI asked Katie to keep to the spirit of Jay's choices, but to include a washed rind cheese as one of the three.\nIsle of Mull Cheddar\nA smokey Scottish cheddar was substituted for the Wisconsin cheddar.\nThe Reade family creates this unpasteurized, traditional cheddar on a small island in northwest Scotland. Short summers provide little fresh pasture for the 100 cows that are raised by the family so diet is supplemented with silage and spent grain husks from a local whiskey distillery. This moist cheddar is made traditionally, meaning it is made in 40 pound drums and wrapped in cloth. This gauze rind allows the cheese to breathe and develop deep, complex flavors during its long aging period. The flavors are earthy and fruity with a bright acidity and subtle peatiness.\nMonte Enebro\nCombining the choices of a blue cheese and a goat's milk cheese.\nFrom the town Avila in Spain comes this extraordinary goat\u2019s milk blue cheese. Formed into a flat log shape, this dense and rich cheese is not pierced, so the blue mold (penicillium roqueforti) grows only on the outside of the cheese. This unique cheese is well balanced with very bright, lemony acidity and a earthy creaminess. A great spring and summer cheese because of the bright, fresh flavors.\nOma, from Von Trapp Farmstead.\nSubstituting a funky washed-rind cheese for the tangy Humboldt Fog.\nBrothers Sebastian and Dan Von Trapp turn organic, raw cow\u2019s milk from their family\u2019s farm in Waitsfield, Vermont into this supple washed rind cheese. A mixed herd (mostly Jerseys) graze on lush Vermont pasture. For being a raw milk, washed rind cheese, the aroma is not intensely funky or earthy. The rich paste is soft and supple, yet will never reach a runny consistency. Oma has well balanced flavors of fresh, raw cream, toasted nuts, and chocolate. Low acidity.\n\u2014Aged by Jasper Hill Farm , in Greensboro, Vermont.\nTHE PREPARATION\nSeven of us gathered at Arrowine on Thursday evening, 28 April 2011. There would be 15 pairings, so there was a 'spit' bucket, if one chose not to drink. Buckets are also provided at cheese judgings, Katie told us. The judges would otherwise be quite cheese-filled.\nLeft to right:\nGraham Reid, Arrowine wine buyer.\nKatie Carter, Arrowine cheesemonger, and \"next level\" cheesemaker at Afina Cheese .\nBadr Adam Abaichi, Arrowine cheesemonger.\nJesse Ploeg, Arrowine beer manager.\nMichael Zelechoski, craft beer sales for beer/wine wholesaler Hop & Wine Beverage .\nNot pictured: Aldo Molina, Arrowine cheesemonger; Thomas Cizauskas of YFGF, behind the camera.\nKatie gave us a quick overview of the cheeses. Isle of Mull Cheddar is aged in a cloth bandage , which protects the cheese as it ages but also allows it to \"breathe,\" its flavor developing. The Isle of Mull is an island off the west coast of Scotland. Cheddaring is the process of making cheddar, a cutting and concentrating of the curds.\nThe Monte Enebro is a pasteurized goat's milk cheese that has been inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti \u2014the same mold as in 'blue cheese'\u2014 but only on the surface rind of the cheese, rather than veined throughout the loaf, as in blue cheese. She described the flavor result as herbaceous.\nThe milk for the Oma comes from an organic-certified dairy in Vermont. The rind is washed with wine and the tomme style cheese is aged for 3 months. The rind develops a characteristic \"stinky foot\" aroma, but the cheese within the rind does not, and is soft and slightly sweet. Oma is not pasteurized.\nThen, it was my turn. I asked the participants to avoid the flights of fancy found on beer rating websites and wine magazines. Paraphrasing the British website CyclopsBeer , I suggested, instead, they use descriptions more useful for a typical beer consumer: no more than 5 words for the appearance, aroma, and taste. More specific flavor terms \u2014such as orange, chocolate, toffee, etc.\u2014 should only be used if those flavors/aromas could be overwhelmingly picked up.\nWhen tasting beer and cheese together (or any beer and food), the taste of the food and the beer together is more important (and more satisfying) than the the taste of the beer or the food by itself. Thus, taste the beer first. Describe it. Then, taste the cheese. Describe it. Then, taste the beer and cheese together, and describe the synergistic result. \" One plus one equals three ,\" said wine buyer Graham.\nThe beers were described by beer manager Jesse Ploeg as each was tasted. (See his notes, above.)\nTHE TASTING\nSaison de Lente\nMost of the panel remarked on the slightly tart but crisp taste of the saison. Badr noted that the peat of the cheddar brought out a sweetness in the finish of the beer, while Katie felt that the saison overpowered the cheddar.\nJesse said that the Monte Enebro goat cheese \"spanked the saison.\" Katie tasted \"band aid\" in the combination.\nGraham liked how the saison cut through the stink of the Oma. Katie sensed a meaty and slimy character when the Oma and saison were tasted together.\nThe Public\nI remarked on the candied grapefruit nose of the beer; Graham noted the quick finish. Katie liked the interplay between the hops and the sharp cheddar flavor; Graham noted a smoked almond flavor when the two were tasted together. I felt that the beer and cheddar together completed the flavors of the other.\nThere was less enthusiasm for the Monte Enebro. I found the pale ale and the cheese tasted medicinal together; Mike added it was like \"going to the dentist.\" Aldo found that the cheese overpowered the beer; the hops simply vanished.\nBadr found the Oma's aroma complimentary to the beer's hops.. Mike added: \"If you like hops, you'll like this combination.\"\nTrappiste Rochefort 10\nAll found flavors and aromas of plum. Katie noted \"warm spices,\" such as ginger and cinnamon. Graham noted the (pleasant) aroma of old banana.\nTasted with the cheddar, the Trappiste seemd to gain an artificial sweetener flavor, Graham observed. Katie said the flavor of the cheddar simply vanished but the beer seemed more carbonated.\nNo one liked the combination of the Monte Enebro blue goat cheese with the beer; the flavors did not meld at all.\nMike found the Trappiste and Oma to be a pleasingly earthy combination. Katie noticed a Gran Marnier flavor. Tasting that, Katie brought out some Parmesan, feeling that the subtle fruitiness of the hardcheese would mesh with the Trappiste. We we all astonished by the gorgeousness of this unplanned combination ... which, again, was the point of this endeavor.\nDubbel Cannon\nWhen the bottle of this 'Belgian-style IPA' was opened, the panel found it too cold, and the pairings simply harsh. Things improved, when a second bottle was opened 15 minutes later. Badr noted flavors of sweet spices, brown sugar, and molasses.\nIn tandem with the cheddar, the group tasted a strong earthinesss. I liked it; Katie not so much.\nJesse found the pairing with the Monte Enegro very salty, \"like Virginia Beach water,\" he said.\nNo one cared for the beer and the Oma together: the flavors clashed unpleasantly.\nMoo Thunder Stout\nKatie said the beer reminded her of iced coffee. Jesse said that Moo Thunder Stout was one of his end-of-the-day \"go-to\" beers; not too strong (4.9% abv), but very flavorful.\nGraham liked the beer but he faulted the combination of the beer with the cheddar: \"Neither enhances the other,\" he said. It's empty calories.\"\nOn the other hand, everyone reacted positively to the stout with the Monte Enebro blue goat cheese. \"The beer's coffee character really accentuates the cheese's goatiness, \" said Jesse.\nNo one cared for the pairing of the Oma with the stout. \"They feel slimy together\" said Mike, \"like I just ate a worm.\"\nSUMMARY\nMost of the panel felt that the Oma washed rind cheese was generally unsuccessful as a mate for any of the cheeses. I disagreed; I liked it with both The Public Pale Ale and with the Dubbel Cannon. However, I agreed that it was not nearly as successful as some of the other pairings.\nFor his favorite combination, Graham voted for DC Brau's The Public Pale Ale paired with the Isle of Mull Cheddar, as did Jesse.\nKatie chose Butternuts' Moo Thunder Stout with the Monte Enebro blue goat cheese, as did Mike.\nBadr voted for the combination of the Trappiste Rochefort 10 ale with the Parmesan. I agreed, but also selected the peaty Cheddar with the hoppy Public Pale Ale.\nThe consensus surprise of the evening was Katie's's last-minute substitution of the Parmesan over the goat cheese to taste with the Trappiste Rocheforte 10 ale.\nCONCLUSION\nOne lesson of the evening?\nBeer and cheese do indeed taste wonderful together, but not all combinations are created equal, and some are downright no good. Do not merely postulate a pairing, but actually taste a proposed beer and cheese, together. Then decide. \"The first rule of beer-and-cheese pairing is that there are no rules, only enthusiastic suggestions .\"\nAnother lesson was something that I thought about after the session had concluded, and we were cleaning up.\nOnly just recently, life in the US was only light lager and processed cheese. Now, the time is indeed a golden era for beer. The variety and quantity of beer available is stunning. Not all is of high quality, but a lot is, and this could be said for cheese as well. Such delights are not guaranteed. As consumers, we need to support those breweries, dairies, restaurants, and merchants who provide us with this bounty.\nThank you to Jay Brooks of the Brookston Beer Bulletin for suggesting this delicious exercise.

The purpose is to determine key attributes indicating an propensity toward superior achievement that can be recognized by most people with experience managing other people. The work is ongoing and is being expanded continuously.\nThe SuperAttainment Research Center is an initiative to help people in management positions identify high potential leaders and channel them toward meaningful contributions to their organizations and to society at large.\nThe 8 attributes of SuperAttainers listed below are considered some of the most common and easiest to identify when accompanied by other aspects of career success.\n8 Attributes of\n1. Early Success\nThe Early Bird Gets the Worm\u0085and Everything Else\nSuperAttainers usually begin doing amazing things early in their life. In fields like music and sport, it has long been understood that for a child to have a chance at greatness, he needs to begin around age 3 and then work at it for many years. In business and politics, unusual ability is also recognized early in a SuperAttainer\u0092s career and is followed with many years of continued achievement. In the greatness game, it is the rabbit who wins the race -- as long as he persists like the tortoise.\n2. Contrarian\nWhen in Rome, Don\u0092t Do As the Romans\nSuperAttainers generally think of themselves as different and apart from other people. They can often be described as rebellious and disobedient by those who try to rule over them and are never willing crowd followers. Tremendous success seems to require doing things tremendously different. Doing things a little better will yield results that are only a little better than others and this is not what SuperAttainers are interested in.\n3. Conceited\nThe Pride Before The Rise\nIn order for someone to be thought of as great in the minds of others, he must first be thought of as great in his own mind. The tremendous achievements of SuperAttainers seem to be merely a realization in the outer world of what is already in their inner world. Predictably, it is uncommon for such people to be overly shy about describing their abundant abilities. Many SuperAttainers have come to recognize that being known as arrogant does not help their purpose and they do a good job of appearing modest. However, a bit of digging into their personality should uncover a deep feeling of self-significance.\n4. Hard-Knocked\nNothing Succeeds Like Suffering\nSuperAttainers have often experienced traumatic periods when their careers or even their lives were in great peril. It is during these times that they gain a deep seated feeling of personal vulnerability that can stay with them for the rest of their lives. The advantage to the future SuperAttainer is that they become consumed by the realization that they must accomplish all they can while they have the chance because it can all come crashing down at any time.\u00a0It is a psychological condition that will drive them to greatness for the rest of their lives.\n5. Loner\nOne is Company, Two is a Crowd\nSuperAttainers are often described by others as dreamers, outsiders, cold-hearted and similar labels often given to loners. They are comfortable spending long periods in the company of themselves to ponder, learn and envisage the future. Many develop a love of solitary activities such as book-reading early in their life. They are not usually enthusiastic participants in team activities except when they are leading the group.\n6. Mentored & Motivated\nBehind Every Great Man are His Parents\nParents often play the key role in the cultivation and realization of SuperAttainers, spending immense amounts of time and money to give their offspring the skills, experiences and relationships required for immense amounts of success. They tutor baby SuperAttainers from the crib, send them to the best schools and put them in touch with the best mentors. It has been shown that mothers, in particular, can play a strong role if they are supremely confident in their son's innate abilities and then take devoted and continuing action to develop them.\n7. Discontent\nPatience is No Virtue\nSuperAttainers have an abnormally intense need for continuous accomplishment. Success does not bring these people a sense of inner peace. There is always someone else to overtake or a higher target to aspire to. They are impatient, dissatisfied and edgy when not engaged in activities that lead to the fulfillment of their personal goals. They seem psychologically unstable in this regard compared with most people.\n8. Promoted\nSelf-Flattery Gets You Everywhere\nThere have been many great people who have lived and died in the history of our species but nobody knows most of them because their achievements were inadequately documented. In order to be thought of as a great success by large numbers of people, someone needs to be a great success at publicizing the SuperAttainer. In most instances, it is the SuperAttainers themselves who are great self-promoters. In other cases, another talented person takes on the critically important role.\nTWO TYPES OF SUPERATTAINERS\n1. Aristocratic SuperAttainers\nPampered and pompous, these people excel despite having been given it all. They grow up with all the best things, attend the best schools and hobnob with the best minds. Because they are so deeply bonded to a powerful and privileged elite, they are often conservative and elitist. Real change seldom happens with these people in charge. On the plus side, they are less likely to lead themselves and their followers down paths of mutual destruction. Examples of Aristocratic SuperAttainers include: Winston Churchill, Peter the Great, Louis XIV and Frederick the Great.\n2. Come-From-\nNothing SuperAttainers\nRags to riches, these people pull themselves up to greatness through tremendous obstacles. Luck plays a role but most of their success is due to relentless force of character. Since they come from outside the establishment, they can be great agents of change. Unfortunately, they are prone to crash and burning when they inevitably overstretch themselves and their supporters. Examples of Come-From-Nothing SuperAttainers include: Joseph Stalin, Napoleon Bonaparte, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Mao Zedong.\nRules for Managers\n"}, {"score": 337.47958, "uuid": "89008d3f-41cf-517a-b8a0-d62bba3666ca", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1302wb-55-19811", "target_hostname": "lovelivegrow.com", "target_uri": "http://lovelivegrow.com/?p=2442", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "Milk Decisions &ndash; Raw Milk or Not? | LoveLiveGrow", "snippet": "We\u2019ve started adding calcium chloride to crisp up our homemade pickles \u2013 it\u2019s definitely easier to find <em>than</em> raw milk!

That\u2019s a decision I\u2019m delighted with, and I still shake my head at how much time I spent drinking lower fat milk. At the bottom of that post, I mentioned that a natural next step would be to switch to raw milk, so I started looking into my local options for raw. Then a commenter on that post, Amy of My Suburban Homestead , said this:\nI have an alternate, unpopular view of raw milk. My view is based on reading the actual stories of people (mostly children) who\u2019ve become very seriously sickened with lifelong debilitating complications. You can read my views, should you wish, here .\nI honestly hadn\u2019t given drinking raw milk that much thought. I prefer to start with unprocessed as the default and work from there if needed/desired, rather than starting with \u201cmodern\u201d as the default. However, I also like for my decisions to make sense and to be based in reality. Here was someone suggesting that more research was in order, and I\u2019m usually happy to undertake research on an interesting topic, especially if it might be controversial.\nI browsed around the different posts and links at My Suburban Homestead and landed on a site called Real Raw Milk Facts . This site is definitely anti-raw milk. I had to dig a little deeper in the links and references there to make sure that Real Raw Milk Facts (RRMF) was representing the facts in a way that I agreed with, and ultimately I came to agree.\nSome of the claims that RRMF covers don\u2019t really interest me. Some people might claim that raw milk cures autism or cancer or whatever, but I never believed anything like that, and those things don\u2019t factor in at all to my decision about what milk to drink. The thing that does seem relevant to me is the safety. Here\u2019s what I understood from the RRMF site:\nYes, raw milk is safer today than it was in the 30s when pasteurization first became common, because refrigeration and sanitation have improved, plus some diseases like bovine tuberculosis have been nearly eliminated.\nAlso, raw milk from pastured cows is likely safer than raw milk from feedlot cows. Feedlot cows have higher levels of E. coli. However, pastured cows can still have pathogens, and in recent years, many E. coli and Campylobacter outbreaks have been linked to pastured cows.\nEither way, there are still many harmful bacteria that can be in raw milk, including Brucella, Campylobacter, Listeria, Mycobacterium bovis, Salmonella, E. coli, Shigella, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Yersinia enterocolitica. E. coli is scary stuff. There have been several recent cases of children almost dying from E. coli contaminated raw milk. Campylobacter is the most common outbreak-causing-pathogen found in raw milk. It usually causes a few days of fever, diarrhea, and cramps, but in rare cases can lead to paralysis.\nYou can, of course, get sick from all kinds of foods. One argument RRMF makes about milk is that it is created in an environment that is difficult to keep sanitary. The care of farm animals involves the management of a lot of shit, and for milk to be contaminated with fecal bacteria is not really unusual. So your fruits and veggies shouldn\u2019t have shit on them anyway (I\u2019m looking at YOU, bagged spinach!), and you also have the ability to wash them. Milk is pretty much expected to come in contact with shit now and then, and you can\u2019t wash it. RRMF argues that products likely to come in contact with shit \u2013 raw beef, poultry, fish \u2013 should be cooked.\u00a0For milk, \u201ccooking\u201d is pasteurization.\nSo, one question that comes to my mind is how many cases of illness are we talking about here? It\u2019s one thing to read about scary outbreaks , but it\u2019s another to look at the actual numbers and percentages. According to the CDC :\n\u201cRaw milk is a well-documented source of infections from Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter, Listeria, Mycobacterium bovis, and other pathogens. In 1938, before widespread adoption of milk pasteurization in the United States, an estimated 25% of all foodborne and waterborne outbreaks of disease were associated with milk. By 2001, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk was estimated at <1%. During 1998\u20132005, a total of 45 outbreaks of foodborne illness were reported to CDC in which unpasteurized milk (or cheese suspected to have been made from unpasteurized milk) was implicated. These outbreaks accounted for 1,007 illnesses, 104 hospitalizations, and two deaths. Because not all cases of foodborne illness are recognized and reported, the actual number of illnesses associated with unpasteurized milk likely is greater.\u201d\nThe RRMF site has this to say about the CDC numbers:\n\u201cSince\u2026only about 1-3% of the population drinks raw milk, the number of illnesses reported show that the actual risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk is tremendously higher than drinking pasteurized milk.\u201d\nIf there are safety concerns with drinking raw milk (and there clearly are) then the next step in my research was to find out if there\u2019s anything that concerns me about the pasteurization or homogenization processes.\nPasteurization is heating milk to a certain temperature for \u00a0a certain amount of time (the exact temp and time depends on which kind of\u00a0pasteurization\u00a0you\u2019re talking about.) Proponents of raw milk claim that this heating destroys any beneficial components of milk, but it doesn\u2019t look to me like this is the case. Some parts of milk are destroyed or diminished\u00a0through\u00a0the pasteurization process, like vitamin A, vitamin C, and some enzymes. Many things remain, as well: some vitamin A, calcium, vitamin D, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B12, iron, etc. There\u2019s plenty of good stuff left in\u00a0pasteurized\u00a0milk.\nI guess some people might be bothered about some of the nutrients being destroyed in the pasteurization process, but if you think of pasteurization as cooking, which is basically what it is, it makes sense to me. When we cook foods, sometimes some nutrients are diminished and sometimes other nutrients are made more available for us. It doesn\u2019t surprise me or bother me that milk is changed by pasteurization, but I don\u2019t think those changes are harmful to me or negate the usefulness (and yumminess) of drinking milk.\nHomogenization is the process of forcing milk through small holes or tubes at high pressure to break up the fat globules. This prevents the milk from separating out into a cream layer. This doesn\u2019t seem to have much effect on the nutrition of the milk, although it has some other effects like making the milk taste blander, yet creamier, and making it less likely to pick up other flavors from your fridge.\nHomogenization doesn\u2019t have anything to do with safety, though, so my first thought after all this research was that I\u2019d look for pasteurized yet not homogenized milk. Unless there\u2019s a reason for the increased complexity and technology, I prefer a simpler choice. I figured I didn\u2019t need a special process to prevent my milk from separating. All you have to do is shake up your bottle of milk to mix it back up, and that\u2019s easy enough to do. Plus, then we\u2019d have cream at-the-ready when we needed it, too.\nThe natural grocery store near me, Earth Fare , carries a pasteurized, non-homogenized milk. Yay! The milk even comes in glass bottles that you pay a deposit on and can return. This was great news all around. Non-homogenized milk, glass bottles, and reusing the bottles over and over again. It seemed like a perfect match. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t like the taste. I tried several times to get used to the taste of the milk, but it was strange and I couldn\u2019t settle into it. I could\u00a0only use it on something really flavorful, like a sugary cereal. But, I like to drink milk by the glass, and I just couldn\u2019t drink this stuff. After several bottles, I went back to my regular organic milk.\nSo that\u2019s the end of my decision-making about milk. I started out drinking non-fat organic, moved to full-fat organic, considered raw, rejected raw, tried non-homogenized, rejected non-homogenized, and settled back at full-fat organic. I really thought raw milk would be the next addition of \u201cfrom the farm to the table\u201d products around here, but the safety issues with raw milk trump my desire to be \u201cnatural\u201d.\nAs a side note about raw milk, just so I\u2019m 100% clear, I think that raw milk should be legal to sell. People should be able to put what they want to into their bodies. I do not think it is the government\u2019s job to protect people from their own bad decisions. Warning labels are fine with me, tiered \u201cgrades\u201d of product are fine, regulating the packaging is fine. But, if people want to buy raw milk (and they clearly do) they should be allowed to do so.\nHow about you? What kind of milk do you drink and why?\nNicola August 22, 2011 at 8:41 am\nI wasn\u2019t even aware that raw milk was readily available over here. I thought unless you had your own milk producing mammal it was all treated produce. After doing, all be it a brief bit of research, I found that there are numerous companies producing it and will deliver it regularly straight to your door.\nMy husband and I are not big milk drinkers, personally I can\u2019t stand milk unless it has been flavoured. Bad I know. But my 2 children love their milk and go through gallons of it. I personally wouldn\u2019t buy raw milk purely based on the potential health issues that may arise. If I wanted it for me and there was some negative outcome that would be fine because I chose it, but if I chose it for my child knowing the risks and they suffered for my decision, I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s right because it is not me that lives with the consequences. I feel that although I am responsible for my children and what goes into their bodies, it is not MY body and although it may be years down the line I have to hand responsibility over. I think too many people make decisions about their children and their bodies based on what they want to do with their own bodies regarless of risks ( and I\u2019m not just referring to raw food products, but chemicals in foods and junk food ect) and forget to remember that it\u2019s not just their own bodies and lives they are impacting.\nHaving said that it is the individuals decision as to what is acceptable risk. Ultimately people should have the right to choose what to put in their bodies. And a responsible parent know what is best for themselves and the child they are nurturing.\nWe drink both organic full fat and organic semi skimmed milk. Full fat for the children, semi for my other half and I get whatever bottle comes out first.\nIbuy organic in the hope that because the farmers have to pay out a fair sum of money to obtain organic status they might actually treat the cows with respect, dignity and the conditions they deserve. It always plays on my mind the fact that I just don\u2019t know for sure though, every time I pick up the bottle I always take a moment and wonder.\nIssa August 22, 2011 at 10:01 am\nParents can\u2019t really avoid making decisions that affect the bodies of their kids, and parents have to make their own individual assessments of risk. Thinking of Dylan definitely affected my decision on raw milk. I was pregnant when I first started researching this, and my conclusion was that even if I might normally be willing to take on this risk, there was no way I would do it while pregnant and no way I would give raw milk to a child.\nI buy organic as well, hoping that means something better for the life of the cows.\naed939 August 22, 2011 at 9:33 am\n\u201cI prefer to start with unprocessed as the default and work from there if needed/desired, rather than starting with \u201cmodern\u201d as the default.\u201d\nI suggest you follow your own principle. So starting with raw milk from a good farmer, why should you instead choose to consume processed milk? There are many negatives to the processed milk:\n* A cocktail of 20 chemical residues http://www.summarynewspaper.com/study-glass-of-milk-there-are-20-chemicals/3627.html ,\n* A1 beta casein http://naturalbias.com/a1-beta-casein-the-devil-in-your-milk/ ,\nIssa August 22, 2011 at 9:56 am\nUh\u2026 did you read the post? I did start from my principle of unprocessed. I started from the assumption of raw milk and went from there. It turns out there\u2019s a very good reason to pasteurize milk \u2013 preventing serious illness from harmful bacteria. There may very well be downsides to pasteurized milk, but they do not seem serious enough to me to outweigh the very real, very immediate risk of these serious illnesses.\nJoshua August 22, 2011 at 12:02 pm\nI suggest you follow your own principle. So starting with raw milk from a good farmer, why should you instead choose to consume processed milk?\nThis is exactly the topic of the post. She started out assuming that she would want to drink raw milk, then went through a process of discovery that led her to choose processed milk. Did you read the post?\nVyviane August 22, 2011 at 10:25 am\nI personally think all milk tastes nasty and it makes my tummy hurt so it\u2019s not really something I worry about to much. I buy the milk alternatives that are cheapest for Chris\u2019s cereal and an occasional glass for Taran. For the few recipes that need actual cow milk I just grab horizon organic as I find that the least offensive tasting of any milk I have had. It\u2019s stupid expensive and I wonder how people cough up $4.50 a cartoon and then let their kids drink glass after glass of it.\nThat all said you may want to look into powered milk if money is a concern. I hear among the thirty/cheap bloggers that it\u2019s cheaper then buying prepared milk, especially if you buy it in 50 pound sacks. Most thrifty people that use it mix it half powered milk and half regular milk for drinking but use it straight up for cooking. They also mix it up and leave it in the fridge overnight which is suppose to improve the taste.\nKitty August 22, 2011 at 10:37 am\nPowdered milk is always non-fat. The fat is taken out during the process, and the proteins are really messed up. There are lots of reasons not to drink it. Putting it in the fridge does help with the taste, but it is still pretty icky.\nIssa August 22, 2011 at 12:12 pm\nI\u2019m one of those people who coughs up the money for organic and then drinks a shit-load of it. I prefer the taste of organic. Some people can taste the effects of the high-heat ultra-pasteurization that organic milk gets and don\u2019t like it, but I apparently like it. Also, I really prefer organic or anything that\u2019s marginally nicer to the animals when available. I\u2019m less concerned with organic produce and I often balk at the price, but for milk, I\u2019m willing to pay the extra.\nI drank some powdered milk once as part of a photo shoot, and it was the most disgusting thing I\u2019ve ever done for money. I guess as much as I\u2019m willing to pay for organic milk, I wasn\u2019t willing to pay for it just to pour over myself. I use it as an ingredient sometimes (like in bread), but I was literally gagging at the barest taste. If I ever do that again, I will try the suggestion to refrigerate it overnight.\nJo August 22, 2011 at 12:32 pm\nWhen I lived in the Arctic, I got used to powdered milk. Where I lived, EVERYTHING had to be flown in (I was on an island) and the cargo rates were something like $1.65 a kilo I think, so liquids were ridiculously expensive. Three bags of milk (equilvalent to a gallon) was $10 and that was in the early 90s. Cans of pop were $2, which made a case of pop (24) almost $50. CRAZY. You just got used to kool-aid and powdered milk. I don\u2019t love it, but it\u2019s tolerable.\nVyviane August 23, 2011 at 9:39 am\nYour photo shoot is making me laugh out loud in a very quiet peaceful coffee shop.\nI hear you on having things you are willing to cough up money on. I bought a $5 head of cauliflower the other day because I was having a hankering for really good cauliflower and I find the non-organic mass produced stuff just doesn\u2019t cut it. For the little bit of meat we eat I buy really nice truly grass fed,allowed to run around, as nicely butchered as possible lamb and the price is shocking especially when you see how much lamb Taran can eat!\nIssa August 23, 2011 at 10:52 pm\nWe may have excess lamb in the future, if you wanted a whole one for the freezer. There\u2019d be a drive up here, but it\u2019d probably be much cheaper. I\u2019d probably be shocked at the price of lamb, given that they can be so cheap if you let them eat grass.\nKitty August 22, 2011 at 10:35 am\nYour decisions makes complete sense. Raw milk can be dangerous. I prefer it when I can get it, but I am a rather healthy adult with a strong digestive system. I don\u2019t think I would drink raw milk while pregnant or breastfeeding, and I also would not give it to a small child. I do think I would give it to an older child, over 7 or 8 years old.\nSince only a few people have died from it I am willing to risk it for myself no question. And if I get sick then my body needs to cope, and get stronger. For me taste is the important thing, raw milk just tastes like what I think milk should taste like. I drank it quite a bit as a child myself (with no ill effect that I know of). Organic whole milk tastes almost as good, so I don\u2019t go out of my way much to get raw. However, if raw was easy to get, I think I would only get raw.\nLee August 22, 2011 at 11:52 am\nI think milk is pretty gross generally and don\u2019t drink it much. I do cook with it and bake with it, but I am not someone who likes the taste of milk period really.\nWhen I was a kid, most of my milk experience was the skim/non-fat crap my mom drank or the non-pasteurized stuff my grandparents drank. The milk I drank at grannie and pops came from cows that live in the pens in the back of the house. It was terribly tasty, but they did not (nor now) drink very much of it, at least in part because of the illness factor.\nThere are things you can\u2019t do with pasteurized milk, making cheese is the big one, and I have sought out farm fresh milk for that reason, but it makes me wary to drink the mammary fluid of a farm animal that was not raised by me or my family.\nYour process to me seems sound, you went for all the alternatives, tried what you thought to be best, made rational decisions and lighted on a stance. For me, the possible health risks and general annoyance of trying to get raw milk outweighed any possible benefits.\nIssa August 22, 2011 at 1:43 pm\nFrom what I\u2019ve read (but not tried), many sources say it works just fine to use pasteurized milk for cheese making, but that you might need to add a small amount of calcium chloride to aid in curd formation. We\u2019ve started adding calcium chloride to crisp up our homemade pickles \u2013 it\u2019s definitely easier to find than raw milk! These same sources agree that ultra-pasteurized milk (which is all organics, I believe) would not be suitable for cheese-making.\nKitty August 22, 2011 at 2:43 pm\nOrganic milk works just fine for Cottage Cheese. So the curd part works ok. I don\u2019t know if it work for the aging part. I will let you know once I get some wax and a figure out a good place to leave cheese.\nJo August 22, 2011 at 12:26 pm\nI have read the argument that humans are the only species to drink the milk of another species and to drink it past infancy, and that is problematic on many levels. The body is not really good at digesting it. I get that argument, and for someone like me who USUALLY walks the walk on things I believe, I just can\u2019t give up cheese and yogurt. They are my total guilty pleasure. PS Did you know in Canada, milk comes in BAGS (much less plastic) as well as full fat milk is called \u201cHOMO\u201d milk on the package, where the other fat contents are called 2%, 1% or skim. Most people think buying HOMO milk is particularly hilarious, never mind in a bag. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_bag and http://www.torontomike.com/2009/11/homo_milk.html\nJo August 23, 2011 at 11:22 am\nNah, bags are not inconvenient at all. Mind you, it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known. Also, it breaks a gallon into three bags, so if one bag spoils, you\u2019ve still got 2/3rds sealed in the fridge. A gallon is also crazy heavy to lift, and after my car collision and hand injury, I\u2019ve become more sensitive to stuff like that. It\u2019s also a colossal waste of plastic.\nSarah August 23, 2011 at 7:49 pm\nI love the bag milk! There is less plastic, less expensive, and it gives me a chance recycle my juice jars to hold the milk. I like the taste of milk out of a glass jar. I am sure there isn\u2019t a true difference, but the milk seems colder and I like really cold milk!\nmichele August 22, 2011 at 2:57 pm\nNo baby cow food for me\u2026nowadays, it\u2019s hemp milk. Rice or coconut sometimes \u2013 hemp milk ice cream is heavenly, thick and creamy. Never have used cow milk for anything other than cereal or cooking, and I haven\u2019t done that in years (except for recipes specifically calling for heavy cream).\nI do use half/half in my coffee, though!\nMary W August 22, 2011 at 4:17 pm\nGreat post! I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about this lately.\nA friend of mine who is huge raw food proponent became really sick from raw milk. I don\u2019t need to go through that. That said, I\u2019d have to drive to another state to get it and I don\u2019t drink enough milk to justify it. We tried buying regular pasteurized instead of ultra- and it went bad before we even opened the containers. I hate wasting food, so unless I know I\u2019ll be using the milk the same day, we\u2019ll be buying ultra-pasteurized, full-fat.\nI\u2019ve switched to full-fat yogurt and it has made a huge difference in how long I can last between breakfast and lunch.\nIssa August 22, 2011 at 10:07 pm\nI really appreciate the longer shelf life of ultra-pasteurized, even if it comes with other downsides. I buy about three gallons of milk at a time \u2013 even as fast as I drink it, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that with regular pasteurized.\ncharlee August 23, 2011 at 5:04 pm\nGrowing up, we had a dairy farm down yonder that we always bought our milk from. It was pasteurized but not homogenized. Hence, I always had to shake it up before using it to mix the heavy cream and the milk together. The taste was awesome for the first 48 hours or so but after that it seemed to take on an almost \u201ccow\u201d taste which seemed to be almost to the point of souring. I can\u2019t explain the taste any better than that. You\u2019d know it once you\u2019ve tasted it. My mother had said she put it in our baby bottles too. I drank that until I was 10 years old which is when we moved into the college town away from the country and started drinking store bought milk. Then it went from whole down to skim.\nYuck, skim milk! You might as well be drinking cloudy water! I eventually settled on 2%. Whole milk is just too thick and 1% is too thin yet. In Florida, I did the renting glass bottles at the local health food store and purchased 2 % Organic milk through them. Crazy expensive. In Atlanta, I had less money and no where close to purchase this same arrangement, so I just bought regular 2% at the store. Until after graduation\u2026then I started buying Organic 2% again but from the grocery store. Here, in NC, I\u2019ve been thinking about going back to the glass bottles, but it is a long haul to the nearest health food store and I\u2019m good with my carton right now. Besides, I recycle. I do miss the taste and temperature of the milk that you get from glass though.\nAshley August 24, 2011 at 9:57 pm\nI\u2019ve been drinking raw milk for about 5 years and have been very happy with it, and have never had a negative effect. I started going for raw milk because I wanted local, family farmed milk, and the only option for that in my area is raw milk from the Amish. I would never purchase raw milk from a farm where I or a good friend hadn\u2019t met the farmer, seen the operation, etc. and thus far it\u2019s worked pretty well for us. We finally have a small local organic milk producer in the area, and depending on how things go with our new farmer (last farmer decided to get out of milk) I may switch.\nIssa August 24, 2011 at 11:24 pm\nI completely understand the desire for local, family farm milk. If I could find a local, smaller operation that used pasteurization I would definitely give that a try. I know those exist; I just haven\u2019t seen a local one.\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of people mention the idea of meeting the farmer, seeing how they operate, etc. That\u2019s a great thing to do to ensure that the animals are treated well and the business uses practices you want to support. However, it\u2019s important for people to realize that that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to the bacterial safety of the milk. Yes, a sloppy organization will be more dangerous, but even very careful practices cannot completely eliminate the possibility of fecal contamination of the milk. The anatomy of the cow just doesn\u2019t make that possible.\nLeah August 31, 2011 at 10:20 pm\nAs always, this is a very interesting post and discussion. I\u2019m a little surprised to be the first to mention grassfed milk as a personal choice. I grew up drinking skim milk, often reconstituted from powder and chilled overnight, and have always found it palatable, but not especially yummy. As an adult I still drink some milk, but not a lot. My 3-1/2 year old son loves milk, and drinks at least 3 small glasses a day. I gave him full fat milk when I first introduced it to him, but gradually transitioned him over to fat free because that is the only kind I can drink (the fattier ones are too thick for me).\nAround the time I started trying to conceive, I started trying to make healthier eating choices to reduce my intake of unfriendly chemicals. Part of that process involved switching to grass-fed beef and organic milk. I was surprised the organic milk didn\u2019t seem to taste different from \u201cconventional\u201d milk. Then I discovered a local health food store carried grass-fed milk, and I tried it. It tasted the way I remember \u201cfresh\u201d milk tasting when I was growing up, and was much richer and more delicious than the conventional and simply organic milk. I figured that if the flesh of grass-fed cows is healthier for your body, which there is quite convincing evidence of, the milk should be, too. In my opinion, it tastes better, at least! I am also fortunate to have a local source for gallon jugs of organic grassfed milk that costs less than most organic (presumably conventionally fed) milk in my area, so that\u2019s what I buy!\nAll that said, I suspect some of the previous posters are, in fact, drinking grassfed organic milk, but I thought the distinction was worth drawing.\nIssa September 4, 2011 at 11:14 pm\nI wondered if the non-homogenized milk I bought was grass fed. It wasn\u2019t organic. It had a more \u201canimal-y\u201d flavor, which might be accounted for more by the diet of the cow than the homogenization or not of the fat. I find grass fed beef to taste *very* different and a little hard to get used to, although not unpleasant. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the taste of our lamb had the same different flavor I associate with grass fed cow\u2026 which makes sense!\ndisaster recovery plan September 6, 2011 at 5:25 pm\nhonestly after all the research and things like that I grew up on Vitamin D mild and I turned out happy and healthy. I have strong bones and friends of mine have had bone density problems from always using low fat or 1%. It has less in it and honestly I think they might as well have added water to the milk to water it down like 1% and still get the nutrients.\nIssa September 6, 2011 at 9:44 pm\nI tried to water down whole milk once. I figured since I didn\u2019t mind lower fat milk, I could buy the whole milk, add a little water, and be able to stretch a carton a little longer. It turns out that it just doesn\u2019t work that way. 1% or nonfat milk is not just watered down whole milk. Lower fat milk still tastes like milk and has the consistency of milk. Watered down whole milk basically tastes like water and has the consistency of water.\nAmandaLP March 3, 2012 at 12:51 am\nI went through a similar process, and I drink raw milk because 1) it doesn\u2019t upset my stomach like any kind of pasturized milk does, and 2) it is cheaper than the local, grass fed, non homogenized milk in the store. (and, 3, I\u2019ve never seen heavy cream that is thick enough to spoon!) I go through only about a half gallon per week.\nThe test to see if milk has been pasturized is to see if an enzyme has been deactivated, so there is a change in enzymes during pasturization. Whatever this change is, it upsets my stomach.\nIn addition, milk that is to be pasturized comes from the same location on a cow, the only difference is that any fecal matter is then cooked into the milk. It won\u2019t make you sick, but still doesnt sound like something tasty.\nYes, drinking raw milk is dangerous, just like eating food and working with livestock. And, if I were pregnant making this choice, it would be a lot harder. But, as a healthy, not pregnant adult, raw, whole milk is the choice I make.\n(by the way, my partner has tried both raw milk and non homogenized grass fed milk, and dislikes both. He drinks regular milk from the store.)\nKendra March 17, 2012 at 7:42 pm\nI have been consuming raw milk for 15 years. At the age of 47 I have not been to the dentist in 15 years and have teeth like a horse. Not a single cavity \u2026. forget about root canals and gum disease! Raw milk is nature\u2019s interferon so all these claims about it being dangerous pretty much get ignored on my part. The real reason \u201cpeople\u201d are up in arms against raw milk to the point of fabricating illnesses associated with it, is because I suspect it keeps many from having to visit Doctors. Let me add that because I travel extensively throughout the U.S. and have farm shares accordingly, I find it interesting that I have NEVER been ill from drinking it regardless of the different sources for obtaining it. The dangers of raw milk are a running joke in Maine where I reside most of the year. In over 100 years I am told by the dairy farmers that they have NEVER heard of anyone contracting a raw milk related illness. In fact claims of being CURED of diseases are mounting in numbers. The monocarpins in particular have wonderful healing properties. The most dangerous disease is ignorance. If one continuously heeds the media and \u201cdoctors\u201d you will certainly contract it! Learn to think for yourselves and stop being so dependant on superficial means of \u201cknowledge\u201d.\nJoshua March 17, 2012 at 9:49 pm\nKendra,\nNo one can deny your experience, and it is your right to make decisions for yourself based on whatever criteria you prefer. Myself, I prefer a scientific method of determining knowledge. You have been consuming raw milk for a long time and you have good teeth. Congratulations. What should convince me that the two have anything to do with each other? I have drunk commercial milk my whole life and also have great teeth. Should that be held up as a counterpoint to your argument?\nI\u2019m glad that you have not gotten sick from drinking raw milk. I wouldn\u2019t wish salmonella on anybody. Do you think that the CDC is just making up their numbers about the occurrence of disease from raw milk?\nThese farmers you know who have never heard of an outbreak of raw-milk-related disease: were they around in 1992, when an outbreak of campylobacter in central Maine was traced to the consumption of raw milk? This is just a newspaper reference that I was able to find with a few minutes of Google searching. I\u2019m sure if I lived in Maine and raised dairy, I would know of a few others that had occurred in the last 100 years. Maybe these farmers from which you buy raw milk are not as well-informed as they ought to be. What other things don\u2019t they know or aren\u2019t they telling you?\nHere\u2019s a link to a newspaper story on the outbreak, just so you know I\u2019m not making it up:\nhttp://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&dat=19920501&id=Iq9JAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zw4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1528,520443\nLearn to think for yourselves and stop being so dependant on superficial means of \u201cknowledge\u201d.\nThis is an incredibly insulting thing to say. Because Issa doesn\u2019t come to the same conclusion as you, she (and, presumably I as well) must be \u201cnot thinking for ourselves\u201d and \u201cdependent on superficial means of knowledge\u201d? Intelligent people can disagree.\nJoshua March 17, 2012 at 10:25 pm\nIt\u2019s also important to point out that, when a person from Maine talks about raw milk, they are not talking about the same product that most people are talking about. Maine is one of ten states that allows the sale of raw milk from licensed and inspected producers. Maine\u2019s standards for allowable levels of coliform bacteria in raw milk are equivalent to the national standard for pasteurized milk. It stands to reason that a person buying raw milk from a licensed and inspected Maine producer is probably not taking much higher risk than someone buying pasteurized milk.\nNow, ask yourself whether you think the average small dairy selling milk in a cow-share is doing as much as a licensed and inspected Maine producer? Are they testing their coliform bacteria levels, for example? In a lot of cases, I suspect the answer is no, and this is why raw milk is associated with higher risks of disease.\nThose of us (the majority) living in states where gray-market raw milk is the only option simply say, \u201craw milk,\u201d and mean the gray-market kind. In a national conversation, it may be meaningful to distinguish between the kind of raw milk found in Maine (and nine other states), and the \u201cgray-market\u201d kind.\n"}, {"score": 335.62793, "uuid": "385ef813-2a48-5385-a62a-233601e1408a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1302wb-61-21575", "target_hostname": "lovelivegrow.com", "target_uri": "http://lovelivegrow.com/2011/08/milk-decisions-raw-milk/", "page_rank": 2.0677176e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "Milk Decisions &ndash; Raw Milk or Not? | LoveLiveGrow", "snippet": "We\u2019ve started adding calcium chloride to crisp up our homemade pickles \u2013 it\u2019s definitely easier to find <em>than</em> raw milk!

That\u2019s a decision I\u2019m delighted with, and I still shake my head at how much time I spent drinking lower fat milk. At the bottom of that post, I mentioned that a natural next step would be to switch to raw milk, so I started looking into my local options for raw. Then a commenter on that post, Amy of My Suburban Homestead , said this:\nI have an alternate, unpopular view of raw milk. My view is based on reading the actual stories of people (mostly children) who\u2019ve become very seriously sickened with lifelong debilitating complications. You can read my views, should you wish, here .\nI honestly hadn\u2019t given drinking raw milk that much thought. I prefer to start with unprocessed as the default and work from there if needed/desired, rather than starting with \u201cmodern\u201d as the default. However, I also like for my decisions to make sense and to be based in reality. Here was someone suggesting that more research was in order, and I\u2019m usually happy to undertake research on an interesting topic, especially if it might be controversial.\nI browsed around the different posts and links at My Suburban Homestead and landed on a site called Real Raw Milk Facts . This site is definitely anti-raw milk. I had to dig a little deeper in the links and references there to make sure that Real Raw Milk Facts (RRMF) was representing the facts in a way that I agreed with, and ultimately I came to agree.\nSome of the claims that RRMF covers don\u2019t really interest me. Some people might claim that raw milk cures autism or cancer or whatever, but I never believed anything like that, and those things don\u2019t factor in at all to my decision about what milk to drink. The thing that does seem relevant to me is the safety. Here\u2019s what I understood from the RRMF site:\nYes, raw milk is safer today than it was in the 30s when pasteurization first became common, because refrigeration and sanitation have improved, plus some diseases like bovine tuberculosis have been nearly eliminated.\nAlso, raw milk from pastured cows is likely safer than raw milk from feedlot cows. Feedlot cows have higher levels of E. coli. However, pastured cows can still have pathogens, and in recent years, many E. coli and Campylobacter outbreaks have been linked to pastured cows.\nEither way, there are still many harmful bacteria that can be in raw milk, including Brucella, Campylobacter, Listeria, Mycobacterium bovis, Salmonella, E. coli, Shigella, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Yersinia enterocolitica. E. coli is scary stuff. There have been several recent cases of children almost dying from E. coli contaminated raw milk. Campylobacter is the most common outbreak-causing-pathogen found in raw milk. It usually causes a few days of fever, diarrhea, and cramps, but in rare cases can lead to paralysis.\nYou can, of course, get sick from all kinds of foods. One argument RRMF makes about milk is that it is created in an environment that is difficult to keep sanitary. The care of farm animals involves the management of a lot of shit, and for milk to be contaminated with fecal bacteria is not really unusual. So your fruits and veggies shouldn\u2019t have shit on them anyway (I\u2019m looking at YOU, bagged spinach!), and you also have the ability to wash them. Milk is pretty much expected to come in contact with shit now and then, and you can\u2019t wash it. RRMF argues that products likely to come in contact with shit \u2013 raw beef, poultry, fish \u2013 should be cooked.\u00a0For milk, \u201ccooking\u201d is pasteurization.\nSo, one question that comes to my mind is how many cases of illness are we talking about here? It\u2019s one thing to read about scary outbreaks , but it\u2019s another to look at the actual numbers and percentages. According to the CDC :\n\u201cRaw milk is a well-documented source of infections from Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter, Listeria, Mycobacterium bovis, and other pathogens. In 1938, before widespread adoption of milk pasteurization in the United States, an estimated 25% of all foodborne and waterborne outbreaks of disease were associated with milk. By 2001, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk was estimated at <1%. During 1998\u20132005, a total of 45 outbreaks of foodborne illness were reported to CDC in which unpasteurized milk (or cheese suspected to have been made from unpasteurized milk) was implicated. These outbreaks accounted for 1,007 illnesses, 104 hospitalizations, and two deaths. Because not all cases of foodborne illness are recognized and reported, the actual number of illnesses associated with unpasteurized milk likely is greater.\u201d\nThe RRMF site has this to say about the CDC numbers:\n\u201cSince\u2026only about 1-3% of the population drinks raw milk, the number of illnesses reported show that the actual risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk is tremendously higher than drinking pasteurized milk.\u201d\nIf there are safety concerns with drinking raw milk (and there clearly are) then the next step in my research was to find out if there\u2019s anything that concerns me about the pasteurization or homogenization processes.\nPasteurization is heating milk to a certain temperature for \u00a0a certain amount of time (the exact temp and time depends on which kind of\u00a0pasteurization\u00a0you\u2019re talking about.) Proponents of raw milk claim that this heating destroys any beneficial components of milk, but it doesn\u2019t look to me like this is the case. Some parts of milk are destroyed or diminished\u00a0through\u00a0the pasteurization process, like vitamin A, vitamin C, and some enzymes. Many things remain, as well: some vitamin A, calcium, vitamin D, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B12, iron, etc. There\u2019s plenty of good stuff left in\u00a0pasteurized\u00a0milk.\nI guess some people might be bothered about some of the nutrients being destroyed in the pasteurization process, but if you think of pasteurization as cooking, which is basically what it is, it makes sense to me. When we cook foods, sometimes some nutrients are diminished and sometimes other nutrients are made more available for us. It doesn\u2019t surprise me or bother me that milk is changed by pasteurization, but I don\u2019t think those changes are harmful to me or negate the usefulness (and yumminess) of drinking milk.\nHomogenization is the process of forcing milk through small holes or tubes at high pressure to break up the fat globules. This prevents the milk from separating out into a cream layer. This doesn\u2019t seem to have much effect on the nutrition of the milk, although it has some other effects like making the milk taste blander, yet creamier, and making it less likely to pick up other flavors from your fridge.\nHomogenization doesn\u2019t have anything to do with safety, though, so my first thought after all this research was that I\u2019d look for pasteurized yet not homogenized milk. Unless there\u2019s a reason for the increased complexity and technology, I prefer a simpler choice. I figured I didn\u2019t need a special process to prevent my milk from separating. All you have to do is shake up your bottle of milk to mix it back up, and that\u2019s easy enough to do. Plus, then we\u2019d have cream at-the-ready when we needed it, too.\nThe natural grocery store near me, Earth Fare , carries a pasteurized, non-homogenized milk. Yay! The milk even comes in glass bottles that you pay a deposit on and can return. This was great news all around. Non-homogenized milk, glass bottles, and reusing the bottles over and over again. It seemed like a perfect match. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t like the taste. I tried several times to get used to the taste of the milk, but it was strange and I couldn\u2019t settle into it. I could\u00a0only use it on something really flavorful, like a sugary cereal. But, I like to drink milk by the glass, and I just couldn\u2019t drink this stuff. After several bottles, I went back to my regular organic milk.\nSo that\u2019s the end of my decision-making about milk. I started out drinking non-fat organic, moved to full-fat organic, considered raw, rejected raw, tried non-homogenized, rejected non-homogenized, and settled back at full-fat organic. I really thought raw milk would be the next addition of \u201cfrom the farm to the table\u201d products around here, but the safety issues with raw milk trump my desire to be \u201cnatural\u201d.\nAs a side note about raw milk, just so I\u2019m 100% clear, I think that raw milk should be legal to sell. People should be able to put what they want to into their bodies. I do not think it is the government\u2019s job to protect people from their own bad decisions. Warning labels are fine with me, tiered \u201cgrades\u201d of product are fine, regulating the packaging is fine. But, if people want to buy raw milk (and they clearly do) they should be allowed to do so.\nHow about you? What kind of milk do you drink and why?\nNicola August 22, 2011 at 8:41 am\nI wasn\u2019t even aware that raw milk was readily available over here. I thought unless you had your own milk producing mammal it was all treated produce. After doing, all be it a brief bit of research, I found that there are numerous companies producing it and will deliver it regularly straight to your door.\nMy husband and I are not big milk drinkers, personally I can\u2019t stand milk unless it has been flavoured. Bad I know. But my 2 children love their milk and go through gallons of it. I personally wouldn\u2019t buy raw milk purely based on the potential health issues that may arise. If I wanted it for me and there was some negative outcome that would be fine because I chose it, but if I chose it for my child knowing the risks and they suffered for my decision, I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s right because it is not me that lives with the consequences. I feel that although I am responsible for my children and what goes into their bodies, it is not MY body and although it may be years down the line I have to hand responsibility over. I think too many people make decisions about their children and their bodies based on what they want to do with their own bodies regarless of risks ( and I\u2019m not just referring to raw food products, but chemicals in foods and junk food ect) and forget to remember that it\u2019s not just their own bodies and lives they are impacting.\nHaving said that it is the individuals decision as to what is acceptable risk. Ultimately people should have the right to choose what to put in their bodies. And a responsible parent know what is best for themselves and the child they are nurturing.\nWe drink both organic full fat and organic semi skimmed milk. Full fat for the children, semi for my other half and I get whatever bottle comes out first.\nIbuy organic in the hope that because the farmers have to pay out a fair sum of money to obtain organic status they might actually treat the cows with respect, dignity and the conditions they deserve. It always plays on my mind the fact that I just don\u2019t know for sure though, every time I pick up the bottle I always take a moment and wonder.\nIssa August 22, 2011 at 10:01 am\nParents can\u2019t really avoid making decisions that affect the bodies of their kids, and parents have to make their own individual assessments of risk. Thinking of Dylan definitely affected my decision on raw milk. I was pregnant when I first started researching this, and my conclusion was that even if I might normally be willing to take on this risk, there was no way I would do it while pregnant and no way I would give raw milk to a child.\nI buy organic as well, hoping that means something better for the life of the cows.\naed939 August 22, 2011 at 9:33 am\n\u201cI prefer to start with unprocessed as the default and work from there if needed/desired, rather than starting with \u201cmodern\u201d as the default.\u201d\nI suggest you follow your own principle. So starting with raw milk from a good farmer, why should you instead choose to consume processed milk? There are many negatives to the processed milk:\n* A cocktail of 20 chemical residues http://www.summarynewspaper.com/study-glass-of-milk-there-are-20-chemicals/3627.html ,\n* A1 beta casein http://naturalbias.com/a1-beta-casein-the-devil-in-your-milk/ ,\nIssa August 22, 2011 at 9:56 am\nUh\u2026 did you read the post? I did start from my principle of unprocessed. I started from the assumption of raw milk and went from there. It turns out there\u2019s a very good reason to pasteurize milk \u2013 preventing serious illness from harmful bacteria. There may very well be downsides to pasteurized milk, but they do not seem serious enough to me to outweigh the very real, very immediate risk of these serious illnesses.\nJoshua August 22, 2011 at 12:02 pm\nI suggest you follow your own principle. So starting with raw milk from a good farmer, why should you instead choose to consume processed milk?\nThis is exactly the topic of the post. She started out assuming that she would want to drink raw milk, then went through a process of discovery that led her to choose processed milk. Did you read the post?\nVyviane August 22, 2011 at 10:25 am\nI personally think all milk tastes nasty and it makes my tummy hurt so it\u2019s not really something I worry about to much. I buy the milk alternatives that are cheapest for Chris\u2019s cereal and an occasional glass for Taran. For the few recipes that need actual cow milk I just grab horizon organic as I find that the least offensive tasting of any milk I have had. It\u2019s stupid expensive and I wonder how people cough up $4.50 a cartoon and then let their kids drink glass after glass of it.\nThat all said you may want to look into powered milk if money is a concern. I hear among the thirty/cheap bloggers that it\u2019s cheaper then buying prepared milk, especially if you buy it in 50 pound sacks. Most thrifty people that use it mix it half powered milk and half regular milk for drinking but use it straight up for cooking. They also mix it up and leave it in the fridge overnight which is suppose to improve the taste.\nKitty August 22, 2011 at 10:37 am\nPowdered milk is always non-fat. The fat is taken out during the process, and the proteins are really messed up. There are lots of reasons not to drink it. Putting it in the fridge does help with the taste, but it is still pretty icky.\nIssa August 22, 2011 at 12:12 pm\nI\u2019m one of those people who coughs up the money for organic and then drinks a shit-load of it. I prefer the taste of organic. Some people can taste the effects of the high-heat ultra-pasteurization that organic milk gets and don\u2019t like it, but I apparently like it. Also, I really prefer organic or anything that\u2019s marginally nicer to the animals when available. I\u2019m less concerned with organic produce and I often balk at the price, but for milk, I\u2019m willing to pay the extra.\nI drank some powdered milk once as part of a photo shoot, and it was the most disgusting thing I\u2019ve ever done for money. I guess as much as I\u2019m willing to pay for organic milk, I wasn\u2019t willing to pay for it just to pour over myself. I use it as an ingredient sometimes (like in bread), but I was literally gagging at the barest taste. If I ever do that again, I will try the suggestion to refrigerate it overnight.\nJo August 22, 2011 at 12:32 pm\nWhen I lived in the Arctic, I got used to powdered milk. Where I lived, EVERYTHING had to be flown in (I was on an island) and the cargo rates were something like $1.65 a kilo I think, so liquids were ridiculously expensive. Three bags of milk (equilvalent to a gallon) was $10 and that was in the early 90s. Cans of pop were $2, which made a case of pop (24) almost $50. CRAZY. You just got used to kool-aid and powdered milk. I don\u2019t love it, but it\u2019s tolerable.\nVyviane August 23, 2011 at 9:39 am\nYour photo shoot is making me laugh out loud in a very quiet peaceful coffee shop.\nI hear you on having things you are willing to cough up money on. I bought a $5 head of cauliflower the other day because I was having a hankering for really good cauliflower and I find the non-organic mass produced stuff just doesn\u2019t cut it. For the little bit of meat we eat I buy really nice truly grass fed,allowed to run around, as nicely butchered as possible lamb and the price is shocking especially when you see how much lamb Taran can eat!\nIssa August 23, 2011 at 10:52 pm\nWe may have excess lamb in the future, if you wanted a whole one for the freezer. There\u2019d be a drive up here, but it\u2019d probably be much cheaper. I\u2019d probably be shocked at the price of lamb, given that they can be so cheap if you let them eat grass.\nKitty August 22, 2011 at 10:35 am\nYour decisions makes complete sense. Raw milk can be dangerous. I prefer it when I can get it, but I am a rather healthy adult with a strong digestive system. I don\u2019t think I would drink raw milk while pregnant or breastfeeding, and I also would not give it to a small child. I do think I would give it to an older child, over 7 or 8 years old.\nSince only a few people have died from it I am willing to risk it for myself no question. And if I get sick then my body needs to cope, and get stronger. For me taste is the important thing, raw milk just tastes like what I think milk should taste like. I drank it quite a bit as a child myself (with no ill effect that I know of). Organic whole milk tastes almost as good, so I don\u2019t go out of my way much to get raw. However, if raw was easy to get, I think I would only get raw.\nLee August 22, 2011 at 11:52 am\nI think milk is pretty gross generally and don\u2019t drink it much. I do cook with it and bake with it, but I am not someone who likes the taste of milk period really.\nWhen I was a kid, most of my milk experience was the skim/non-fat crap my mom drank or the non-pasteurized stuff my grandparents drank. The milk I drank at grannie and pops came from cows that live in the pens in the back of the house. It was terribly tasty, but they did not (nor now) drink very much of it, at least in part because of the illness factor.\nThere are things you can\u2019t do with pasteurized milk, making cheese is the big one, and I have sought out farm fresh milk for that reason, but it makes me wary to drink the mammary fluid of a farm animal that was not raised by me or my family.\nYour process to me seems sound, you went for all the alternatives, tried what you thought to be best, made rational decisions and lighted on a stance. For me, the possible health risks and general annoyance of trying to get raw milk outweighed any possible benefits.\nIssa August 22, 2011 at 1:43 pm\nFrom what I\u2019ve read (but not tried), many sources say it works just fine to use pasteurized milk for cheese making, but that you might need to add a small amount of calcium chloride to aid in curd formation. We\u2019ve started adding calcium chloride to crisp up our homemade pickles \u2013 it\u2019s definitely easier to find than raw milk! These same sources agree that ultra-pasteurized milk (which is all organics, I believe) would not be suitable for cheese-making.\nKitty August 22, 2011 at 2:43 pm\nOrganic milk works just fine for Cottage Cheese. So the curd part works ok. I don\u2019t know if it work for the aging part. I will let you know once I get some wax and a figure out a good place to leave cheese.\nJo August 22, 2011 at 12:26 pm\nI have read the argument that humans are the only species to drink the milk of another species and to drink it past infancy, and that is problematic on many levels. The body is not really good at digesting it. I get that argument, and for someone like me who USUALLY walks the walk on things I believe, I just can\u2019t give up cheese and yogurt. They are my total guilty pleasure. PS Did you know in Canada, milk comes in BAGS (much less plastic) as well as full fat milk is called \u201cHOMO\u201d milk on the package, where the other fat contents are called 2%, 1% or skim. Most people think buying HOMO milk is particularly hilarious, never mind in a bag. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_bag and http://www.torontomike.com/2009/11/homo_milk.html\nJo August 23, 2011 at 11:22 am\nNah, bags are not inconvenient at all. Mind you, it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known. Also, it breaks a gallon into three bags, so if one bag spoils, you\u2019ve still got 2/3rds sealed in the fridge. A gallon is also crazy heavy to lift, and after my car collision and hand injury, I\u2019ve become more sensitive to stuff like that. It\u2019s also a colossal waste of plastic.\nSarah August 23, 2011 at 7:49 pm\nI love the bag milk! There is less plastic, less expensive, and it gives me a chance recycle my juice jars to hold the milk. I like the taste of milk out of a glass jar. I am sure there isn\u2019t a true difference, but the milk seems colder and I like really cold milk!\nmichele August 22, 2011 at 2:57 pm\nNo baby cow food for me\u2026nowadays, it\u2019s hemp milk. Rice or coconut sometimes \u2013 hemp milk ice cream is heavenly, thick and creamy. Never have used cow milk for anything other than cereal or cooking, and I haven\u2019t done that in years (except for recipes specifically calling for heavy cream).\nI do use half/half in my coffee, though!\nMary W August 22, 2011 at 4:17 pm\nGreat post! I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about this lately.\nA friend of mine who is huge raw food proponent became really sick from raw milk. I don\u2019t need to go through that. That said, I\u2019d have to drive to another state to get it and I don\u2019t drink enough milk to justify it. We tried buying regular pasteurized instead of ultra- and it went bad before we even opened the containers. I hate wasting food, so unless I know I\u2019ll be using the milk the same day, we\u2019ll be buying ultra-pasteurized, full-fat.\nI\u2019ve switched to full-fat yogurt and it has made a huge difference in how long I can last between breakfast and lunch.\nIssa August 22, 2011 at 10:07 pm\nI really appreciate the longer shelf life of ultra-pasteurized, even if it comes with other downsides. I buy about three gallons of milk at a time \u2013 even as fast as I drink it, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that with regular pasteurized.\ncharlee August 23, 2011 at 5:04 pm\nGrowing up, we had a dairy farm down yonder that we always bought our milk from. It was pasteurized but not homogenized. Hence, I always had to shake it up before using it to mix the heavy cream and the milk together. The taste was awesome for the first 48 hours or so but after that it seemed to take on an almost \u201ccow\u201d taste which seemed to be almost to the point of souring. I can\u2019t explain the taste any better than that. You\u2019d know it once you\u2019ve tasted it. My mother had said she put it in our baby bottles too. I drank that until I was 10 years old which is when we moved into the college town away from the country and started drinking store bought milk. Then it went from whole down to skim.\nYuck, skim milk! You might as well be drinking cloudy water! I eventually settled on 2%. Whole milk is just too thick and 1% is too thin yet. In Florida, I did the renting glass bottles at the local health food store and purchased 2 % Organic milk through them. Crazy expensive. In Atlanta, I had less money and no where close to purchase this same arrangement, so I just bought regular 2% at the store. Until after graduation\u2026then I started buying Organic 2% again but from the grocery store. Here, in NC, I\u2019ve been thinking about going back to the glass bottles, but it is a long haul to the nearest health food store and I\u2019m good with my carton right now. Besides, I recycle. I do miss the taste and temperature of the milk that you get from glass though.\nAshley August 24, 2011 at 9:57 pm\nI\u2019ve been drinking raw milk for about 5 years and have been very happy with it, and have never had a negative effect. I started going for raw milk because I wanted local, family farmed milk, and the only option for that in my area is raw milk from the Amish. I would never purchase raw milk from a farm where I or a good friend hadn\u2019t met the farmer, seen the operation, etc. and thus far it\u2019s worked pretty well for us. We finally have a small local organic milk producer in the area, and depending on how things go with our new farmer (last farmer decided to get out of milk) I may switch.\nIssa August 24, 2011 at 11:24 pm\nI completely understand the desire for local, family farm milk. If I could find a local, smaller operation that used pasteurization I would definitely give that a try. I know those exist; I just haven\u2019t seen a local one.\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of people mention the idea of meeting the farmer, seeing how they operate, etc. That\u2019s a great thing to do to ensure that the animals are treated well and the business uses practices you want to support. However, it\u2019s important for people to realize that that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to the bacterial safety of the milk. Yes, a sloppy organization will be more dangerous, but even very careful practices cannot completely eliminate the possibility of fecal contamination of the milk. The anatomy of the cow just doesn\u2019t make that possible.\nLeah August 31, 2011 at 10:20 pm\nAs always, this is a very interesting post and discussion. I\u2019m a little surprised to be the first to mention grassfed milk as a personal choice. I grew up drinking skim milk, often reconstituted from powder and chilled overnight, and have always found it palatable, but not especially yummy. As an adult I still drink some milk, but not a lot. My 3-1/2 year old son loves milk, and drinks at least 3 small glasses a day. I gave him full fat milk when I first introduced it to him, but gradually transitioned him over to fat free because that is the only kind I can drink (the fattier ones are too thick for me).\nAround the time I started trying to conceive, I started trying to make healthier eating choices to reduce my intake of unfriendly chemicals. Part of that process involved switching to grass-fed beef and organic milk. I was surprised the organic milk didn\u2019t seem to taste different from \u201cconventional\u201d milk. Then I discovered a local health food store carried grass-fed milk, and I tried it. It tasted the way I remember \u201cfresh\u201d milk tasting when I was growing up, and was much richer and more delicious than the conventional and simply organic milk. I figured that if the flesh of grass-fed cows is healthier for your body, which there is quite convincing evidence of, the milk should be, too. In my opinion, it tastes better, at least! I am also fortunate to have a local source for gallon jugs of organic grassfed milk that costs less than most organic (presumably conventionally fed) milk in my area, so that\u2019s what I buy!\nAll that said, I suspect some of the previous posters are, in fact, drinking grassfed organic milk, but I thought the distinction was worth drawing.\nIssa September 4, 2011 at 11:14 pm\nI wondered if the non-homogenized milk I bought was grass fed. It wasn\u2019t organic. It had a more \u201canimal-y\u201d flavor, which might be accounted for more by the diet of the cow than the homogenization or not of the fat. I find grass fed beef to taste *very* different and a little hard to get used to, although not unpleasant. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the taste of our lamb had the same different flavor I associate with grass fed cow\u2026 which makes sense!\ndisaster recovery plan September 6, 2011 at 5:25 pm\nhonestly after all the research and things like that I grew up on Vitamin D mild and I turned out happy and healthy. I have strong bones and friends of mine have had bone density problems from always using low fat or 1%. It has less in it and honestly I think they might as well have added water to the milk to water it down like 1% and still get the nutrients.\nIssa September 6, 2011 at 9:44 pm\nI tried to water down whole milk once. I figured since I didn\u2019t mind lower fat milk, I could buy the whole milk, add a little water, and be able to stretch a carton a little longer. It turns out that it just doesn\u2019t work that way. 1% or nonfat milk is not just watered down whole milk. Lower fat milk still tastes like milk and has the consistency of milk. Watered down whole milk basically tastes like water and has the consistency of water.\nAmandaLP March 3, 2012 at 12:51 am\nI went through a similar process, and I drink raw milk because 1) it doesn\u2019t upset my stomach like any kind of pasturized milk does, and 2) it is cheaper than the local, grass fed, non homogenized milk in the store. (and, 3, I\u2019ve never seen heavy cream that is thick enough to spoon!) I go through only about a half gallon per week.\nThe test to see if milk has been pasturized is to see if an enzyme has been deactivated, so there is a change in enzymes during pasturization. Whatever this change is, it upsets my stomach.\nIn addition, milk that is to be pasturized comes from the same location on a cow, the only difference is that any fecal matter is then cooked into the milk. It won\u2019t make you sick, but still doesnt sound like something tasty.\nYes, drinking raw milk is dangerous, just like eating food and working with livestock. And, if I were pregnant making this choice, it would be a lot harder. But, as a healthy, not pregnant adult, raw, whole milk is the choice I make.\n(by the way, my partner has tried both raw milk and non homogenized grass fed milk, and dislikes both. He drinks regular milk from the store.)\nKendra March 17, 2012 at 7:42 pm\nI have been consuming raw milk for 15 years. At the age of 47 I have not been to the dentist in 15 years and have teeth like a horse. Not a single cavity \u2026. forget about root canals and gum disease! Raw milk is nature\u2019s interferon so all these claims about it being dangerous pretty much get ignored on my part. The real reason \u201cpeople\u201d are up in arms against raw milk to the point of fabricating illnesses associated with it, is because I suspect it keeps many from having to visit Doctors. Let me add that because I travel extensively throughout the U.S. and have farm shares accordingly, I find it interesting that I have NEVER been ill from drinking it regardless of the different sources for obtaining it. The dangers of raw milk are a running joke in Maine where I reside most of the year. In over 100 years I am told by the dairy farmers that they have NEVER heard of anyone contracting a raw milk related illness. In fact claims of being CURED of diseases are mounting in numbers. The monocarpins in particular have wonderful healing properties. The most dangerous disease is ignorance. If one continuously heeds the media and \u201cdoctors\u201d you will certainly contract it! Learn to think for yourselves and stop being so dependant on superficial means of \u201cknowledge\u201d.\nJoshua March 17, 2012 at 9:49 pm\nKendra,\nNo one can deny your experience, and it is your right to make decisions for yourself based on whatever criteria you prefer. Myself, I prefer a scientific method of determining knowledge. You have been consuming raw milk for a long time and you have good teeth. Congratulations. What should convince me that the two have anything to do with each other? I have drunk commercial milk my whole life and also have great teeth. Should that be held up as a counterpoint to your argument?\nI\u2019m glad that you have not gotten sick from drinking raw milk. I wouldn\u2019t wish salmonella on anybody. Do you think that the CDC is just making up their numbers about the occurrence of disease from raw milk?\nThese farmers you know who have never heard of an outbreak of raw-milk-related disease: were they around in 1992, when an outbreak of campylobacter in central Maine was traced to the consumption of raw milk? This is just a newspaper reference that I was able to find with a few minutes of Google searching. I\u2019m sure if I lived in Maine and raised dairy, I would know of a few others that had occurred in the last 100 years. Maybe these farmers from which you buy raw milk are not as well-informed as they ought to be. What other things don\u2019t they know or aren\u2019t they telling you?\nHere\u2019s a link to a newspaper story on the outbreak, just so you know I\u2019m not making it up:\nhttp://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&dat=19920501&id=Iq9JAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zw4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1528,520443\nLearn to think for yourselves and stop being so dependant on superficial means of \u201cknowledge\u201d.\nThis is an incredibly insulting thing to say. Because Issa doesn\u2019t come to the same conclusion as you, she (and, presumably I as well) must be \u201cnot thinking for ourselves\u201d and \u201cdependent on superficial means of knowledge\u201d? Intelligent people can disagree.\nJoshua March 17, 2012 at 10:25 pm\nIt\u2019s also important to point out that, when a person from Maine talks about raw milk, they are not talking about the same product that most people are talking about. Maine is one of ten states that allows the sale of raw milk from licensed and inspected producers. Maine\u2019s standards for allowable levels of coliform bacteria in raw milk are equivalent to the national standard for pasteurized milk. It stands to reason that a person buying raw milk from a licensed and inspected Maine producer is probably not taking much higher risk than someone buying pasteurized milk.\nNow, ask yourself whether you think the average small dairy selling milk in a cow-share is doing as much as a licensed and inspected Maine producer? Are they testing their coliform bacteria levels, for example? In a lot of cases, I suspect the answer is no, and this is why raw milk is associated with higher risks of disease.\nThose of us (the majority) living in states where gray-market raw milk is the only option simply say, \u201craw milk,\u201d and mean the gray-market kind. In a national conversation, it may be meaningful to distinguish between the kind of raw milk found in Maine (and nine other states), and the \u201cgray-market\u201d kind.\n"}, {"score": 336.63925, "uuid": "46367f26-8cf1-5fdd-8d34-924137afae8a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1912wb-50-19615", "target_hostname": "croquecamille.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://croquecamille.wordpress.com/tag/fete-du-fromage/", "page_rank": 1.2317518e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "F&ecirc;te du Fromage &laquo; Croque-Camille", "snippet": "Nick, intrepid soul that he is, tasted a leaf as I asked hopefully, \u201c<em>Does</em> it <em>taste</em> yellow?\u201d Came the reply.

The server delivered it with milk and the customary sugar container.\u00a0 As I spied the sugar holder I noticed it was stuffed with all the different colored packets of saccharine chemicals otherwise known as \u201cartificial sweeteners.\u201d\nThere, amongst all the kaleidoscopic counterfeits were two lone packets of real sugar.\u00a0 With chemical dispenser in hand, I hailed the waiter.\u00a0 As he approached he asked:\u00a0 \u201cNeed some more Sweet & Low?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d I sharply retorted, \u201cI need some real sugar!\u201d Five to be exact for my tea.\u00a0 Interesting that he assumed I was a food neurotic.\nI hate fake food.\nWhat do I mean by fake?\u00a0 I propose three general categories.\u00a0 The first is when a facsimile of a particular food is referred to as the same name as the real McCoy.\u00a0 Take caviar for example.\u00a0 Traditionally, the term caviar denotes the roe of sturgeon, and more specifically sturgeon from the Caspian Sea.\u00a0 But you can find sturgeon roe from America, or worse yet, roe from other fish such as salmon or lumpfish, labeled as \u201ccaviar.\u201d\nAnother example is cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Real cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, as made in France, is unpasteurized cream thickened by the action of bacteria naturally found in the cream.\u00a0 But in germaphobic America, unpasteurized milk products are a no-no, despite the fact that it\u2019s obviously safe to eat, as evidenced by a lack of Frenchmen dropping dead in droves.\u00a0 Thus in the US, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is made with pasteurized cream and thickened by adding buttermilk or sour cream.\nThe wine world is replete with these misidentifications. Champagne, Burgundy, and Chablis (from France), Port, (from Portugal) and Chianti, (from Italy), all refer to wines whose grapes and production methods are reflective of a specific geographic location.\u00a0 There are no Italian Champagnes, American Chiantis or Australian ports, not real ones anyway, but there are wines labeling themselves as such.\nThis is not about snobbery. It\u2019s about the character and qualities of the product in question.\u00a0 In a word it\u2019s about taste. The same biological product cultivated in two discrepant parts of the world will produce different flavor profiles. The fact that there is a difference is indisputable. Which tastes better is where contrary opinions emerge.\nI could take the politically correct route and tell you that there\u2019s no right or wrong, it\u2019s all based on your own palate, go forth and revel in your subjective self-validation. But I\u2019m not!\u00a0 I\u2019ve had Russian and American caviar and the American isn\u2019t as good. I\u2019ve eaten cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche in France and it\u2019s clearly superior to the sanitized American version. And don\u2019t even get me started on real Port from the Douro Valley of Portugal compared to those cheap jugs of Australian or American \u201cport.\u201d\nMissing Ingredients\nThe second type of fake food is any product that has had any of its key ingredients reduced or eliminated:\u00a0 decaffeinated coffee, light beer, low-fat mayonnaise, diet soda, you get the picture. I find light beer most perplexing. There\u2019s not a huge difference in calories between real beer and light beer.\u00a0 You\u2019re already consuming alcohol and empty calories. So for God sakes, just have a beer.\nPhonie Baloney\nThe last category of fake food is the most egregious:\u00a0 blatantly ersatz phonies such as artificial sweetener, imitation crab meat, margarine, non dairy creamer, and salt substitutes.\u00a0 (Some salt substitutes are 100% potassium chloride, as opposed to mixtures of real salt and potassium chloride which are \u201ccategory 2\u201d fakes).\u00a0 These products are an affront to everything I hold gastronomically holy.\nFake foods are routinely endorsed by those who have hang-ups about the substance in question or harbor dubious health fears.\u00a0 I\u2019m excluding of course diabetics, individuals with food allergies, or those who suffer from other genuine medical conditions.\u00a0 Those are all a different story. What I\u2019m alluding to is the relentless, usually spurious, and frequently exaggerated paranoia about salt, sugar, carbs, fat, red meat, calories, and whatever other substance the latest food propagandists are alleging will cause cancer, environmental damage, immortal sin, political outrage and general Armageddon.\nAs a chef and unabashed hedonist, I champion the glories of food and not the shackles of deprivation. As I\u2019ve written many times before, food goes well beyond the momentary physical pleasure.\u00a0 Not to minimize that pleasure but that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg.\nRelishing in satisfying, real food, is about savoring life.\u00a0 It\u2019s about taking a much needed respite in the middle of a hectic day.\u00a0 It\u2019s about connecting with friends.\u00a0 It\u2019s about nurturing your family. It\u2019s about sharing a romantic interlude with your partner.\u00a0 It\u2019s about celebrating life\u2019s most treasured moments.\u00a0 Food and drink are about, or should be about, embracing and enjoying life.\u00a0 Food should feed our souls as much as our bodies. Personally I look forward to every meal, every day.\nLast Friday night my wife and I had a wonderful dinner at an Italian restaurant with two of our closest friends.\u00a0 We had a delicious meal, a good bottle of wine, (actually a little more than one good bottle), and chatted about all sorts of things.\u00a0 It was a relaxing evening and it gave me something to look forward to all day. These are the moments of my life I will fondly remember, not the bagel with low-fat cream cheese and rank decaf coffee.\nNow take the food neurotic. They dread each and every meal.\u00a0 For them, every food encounter is an opportunity to gain weight, erode their health, or consume something morally or politically prohibited.\u00a0 Every impending meal begins a cycle of rumination about fat, calories, animal products, heart disease, and a myriad of other anxieties.\nFor them food is something fraught with peril that must be managed and negotiated.\u00a0 My Friday night dinner with friends would have been tortuous for the fake-food-fanciers.\u00a0 They would have agonized over the politically incorrect veal, the saturated fat in the cheese, and the sodium content of the sauce.\nThey would have struggled with or eschewed the sweet dessert.\u00a0 They would have felt guilty about the calorie and alcohol consumption. The next week they would have deprived themselves to make up for the \u201cindulgence.\u201d As for myself, it\u2019s a week later and I\u2019m still basking in the glow of the evening. You tell me who has a better quality of life.\nIn closing I must admit that you can sell me on the idea of moderation. But as Julia Child once said: \u201cEverything in moderation, including moderation.\u201d And always remember\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..keep it real.\nChef Mark R.

Time to Revise History? IA Ag Candidate Stirs Waves; Get Blog Updates\nby: David Gumpert Sat, 10/16/2010 - 01:45\nSometimes when I read major media financial publications, I think I'm reading something from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. I especially get this feeling when one or another provide commentary on investing in precious metals.\nThe current issue of Forbes is a case in point. One of its professional investor columnists writes , \"Gold is supposed to be an anchor of stability in uneasy times. Currencies can collapse, stock markets can crash, bonds can default, but that yellow stuff is there forever. And so you are expected to put some portion of your retirement assets...in gold. I am going to try to talk you out of this...I think the best way to contend with these uncertainties over a quarter of a century is with a well-diversified portfolio of cheap index funds...Skip the precious-metals allocation.\"\nIn other words, having forsaken the \"index funds\" for something like gold would have been dangerous, highly risky, in the view of this \"professional.\" No matter that a $10,000 investment in gold in the year 2000 would have increased to $50,000 today, while the same $10,000 invested in a fund mimicking the Dow Jones Industrial Average would still be worth about $10,000 (in dollars that are depreciating practically before our eyes).\nTen-year trend in gold prices, 2000-2010Sound familiar? Sort of like the \"professionals\" who tell us that consuming unpasteurized dairy is so terribly risky, when the government's own data actually tell us it isn't particularly risky.\u00a0 In both arenas, the professionals hollering fear and danger so vastly outnumber those preaching calm and reason that most of the public accepts the conventional wisdom as gospel.\nI got to thinking about the comparison between investing and eating a few days ago, when I read that Ohio State University is planning a study about why people drink raw milk. It is looking for 60 raw milk drinkers (as well as 60 pasteurized milk drinkers) to answer questions, fill out some forms, and provide samples of the milk they drink, to be examined for fat content. One of the scientists quoted in the Ohio State press release about the study states, \"We truly do not know very much about how people make the choice to drink raw or pasteurized milk -- there's just nothing in the literature,\" How about that, there's nothing in the literature. Maybe because the scientists have been so busy trying to scare people from drinking raw milk.\nI'm certainly open to the public health community and the government wanting to learn more about why increasing numbers of people are drinking raw milk, and maybe, radical thought, what the nutritional benefits of raw milk might be. Don Neeper, an Ohio raw-milk activist who comments here, wrote me that he has been told by one of the scientists at Ohio State that the team is \"committed to running an impartial study.\"\nThat would be quite something in itself, since the study's \"principal investigator\", Jeffrey LeJeune, is a professor who last year published an article about the dangers of raw milk consumption in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, entitled, \"Unpasteurized Milk: A Continued Public Health Threat\".\nIt concluded: \"Given that milk is derived from animals, it inherently carries the risk of being contaminated with pathogens from its source (cattle, goats, sheep, and the farm environment). The key factor in the prevention of milkborne disease is consumer avoidance of raw milk consumption. In an effort to protect human health, a number of organizations have published guidelines and statements concerning milk pasteurization. The American Medical Association (policy H-150.980) [67] clearly asserts that milk sold for human consumption should be pasteurized. Likewise, the American Veterinary Medical Association asserts that only pasteurized milk and milk products should be sold for human consumption [68]. Thus, physicians, veterinarians, and dairy farmers who promote, or even condone, the human consumption of unpasteurized milk and dairy products may be at risk for subsequent legal action.\" Yes, the old \"Say-something-good-about-raw-milk-and-I'll-sue-you routine.\" I thought you had to be a lawyer to use that trick.\nNeeper is inclined to cooperate with the study, and that makes sense\u00a0 (though I imagine the scientists could find out pretty quickly why raw milk drinkers do what they do, and save a bunch of dough, by attending a local Weston A. Price chapter meeting). The whole thing has something of the flavor of a British anthropologist heading out to study the indigenous population in one of the empire's colonies 100 years ago--hold my nose and try to figure out what these uncivilized wretches are like so I can write my paper.\nI can't imagine someone like LeJeune could come up with more negatives about raw milk than he has already, except maybe to conclude that drinkers are clinically deranged. More likely, he'll be like the professional investors who continue to disparage investing in gold--he won't let something so mundane as the facts interfere with his view of the world.\nMaybe the discussion on outsourcing following my previous post didn't result in the butter sticker plan Amanda Rose liked being implemented by Organic Pastures Dairy Co., but it certainly was civil and substantive. Perhaps an acknowledgment by all concerned, including me, that outsourcing for providers of premium nutrient-dense foods is an important matter. Consumers need to get as close to their food as possible. Suppliers need to be especially careful, and transparent. Sure, Lykke and Amanda may have different perspectives, but the conversation with Mark McAfee was amazingly substantive, and he was as responsive and forthcoming as any company president could be.\nI'll add that I agree with Lykke that the Weston A. Price Foundation would do well to revise its account of the 2006 illnesses blamed on Organic Pastures. The WAPF account seems to blame spinach and antibiotics, when it says a recall of OPDC milk \"occurred during the midst of the spinach contamination scare and seemed to be aimed at deflecting attention from the huge problems of E.coli O157:H7 contamination in produce. The state claimed that five raw milk-drinking children became ill, two of whom were hospitalized, given antibiotics and almost died. (The other three received no antibiotics and recovered quickly.)\"\nOn the political front, there's something interesting happening in Iowa. One candidate for secretary of agriculture is actually talking about busting agri-business monopolies and using local food production to create jobs. He's Francis Thicke , and he's trying to raise gain national financial support to win an upset victory against a Big Ag candidate in a serious agricultural state.\nHe tells me in an email, \"I am trailing the incumbent narrowly (within the margin of statistical error).\u00a0 The very good news is that when respondents were given basic facts about the incumbent\u2019s and my positions on issues, I passed him by a large margin.\"\nWe need more people like Thicke running for office.\nI'm frequently asked by readers of this blog whether there is a way to be alerted by email when a new post goes up, or a new comment is entered following a particular post. It turns out there is. It's not super simple to get going, but it's not terribly complicated, either, and I'm told by a few readers that it does work.

But my alarm bells really started ringing when I read the study would be run by a certified raw-milk opponent. (Uhhh, repeat that again?!?)\nWhat a fantastic way for raw-milk opponents to find out how raw milk is supplied and obtain milk sources or at least be able to figure out where they might be, as well as a golden opportunity to test all the various samples, which almost certainly won't have been handled ideally, for bacteria AND they'll already know who that supplier is (if a participant was ignorant enough and gave it to them) or probably figure out where or who the supplier might be; and then can come down like an investigatory ton of bricks if they feel the samples were contaminated... even if there are no illnesses.\nUnless, of course, all participants were guaranteed completely anonymity and were not required to give their addresses or addresses of suppliers.\nSeems like a potential witch-hunt in the making to me.\nwho: Goatmaid | when: Sat, 10/16/2010 - 13:52 |\nLog in or register to post comments\nFrom Bill's link; they only asked 12 consumers-that was all they could find? 11 have been drinking raw milk within 5 yrs, 10 of the 12 with college degrees,9 drank for health reasons, I wonder why they singled out the woman who stated she was seeking holistic avenues? As I read that, I felt the writer was implying there was something abnormal with holistic approach to health care. If that is the case then shame on them as for optimal care you must treat the \"whole\" person. 8 of the 12 said it tasted better then boiled milk.\nWhat is so difficult for people to understand? Some like raw dairy, some like fast foods, it is a choice and why is it so important for the govt to rule what one consumes? As said many times, raw milk is not going away, the continued ban and scare tactics will only push it underground thus causing a true contamination and increase health risk. The govt is not working with farmers or consumers to make our food safer.

In other words, propaganda development. -- also my comment at Marler's blog.\nThere was a similar study in Wisconsin and California and those were worthless.\nThe OSU planned study is a joke. Here is a statement given to Don Neeper earlier today by the research assistant.\nHello Mr. Neeper,\nI am a graduate student at Ohio State working on my thesis involving the raw milk study you inquired about. Dr. Medeiros forwarded your email along to me since I am in charge of coordinating the participants in the study so hopefully I can answer all of your questions.\nIn general our study will consist of a focus group, survey, 4 day food record, and a milk sample. The focus group will consist of either pasteurized milk drinkers or raw milk drinkers. This will even further be broken down based on whether you live on a dairy farm or not. We want there to be free and open conversation among all focus group participants, so we will keep the milk groups separated so everyone will feel comfortable. The survey, food record and test tubes will be sent home with participants after the focus group and the individuals will be instructed to select an appointment time for the health assessment the following week. During the appointment time the health assessment will be conducted privately as well as reviewing the food record for completeness. In total we expect each day to take about 1 to 2 hours.\nTo specifically address your questions:\n1. We will be freezing the milk samples shortly after receiving them at -30 degrees. I will only be extracting fat from each sample and analyzing the fat content and composition of the milk samples (both raw and pasteurized). We are asking for a sample of milk that you drink as well as the milk as it is in the container. There also will be another test tube that will be collected and stored. Currently there are no plans for that sample's use and if anyone chooses to use it in the future, they must first get your consent to be able to do so. So if you choose to participate and provide us with a milk sample you are only giving us permission to examine the fat content and composition, nothing else.\n2. The health assessment will include height, weight, waist circumference and something else called a sagittal abdominal diameter. We are looking primarily at BMI and central adiposity. There is a certain fat in milk that has been shown to have some affect on central adiposity so we wanted to see if there was any correlation between the amount in the milk and central adiposity. But there is nothing more invasive than simple measurements.\n3. There are many comparisons to make from this study. The focus groups and most of the survey will compare thoughts, behaviors, motivations, barriers, and reasons related to milk choices. The food record will compare overall dietary intake of the individuals, looking specifically at fat, vitamin D and calcium intake. The milk sample will compare the specific fatty acid profile of the milk including the fat percentage. And the health assessment will allow us to compare BMI and central adiposity between groups. Many of these will then be compared against each other, like health assessment and fatty acid profile, or dietary intake and health assessment. We do ask demographic information on our survey, but our objective is not to compare education levels, income, etc. However, if these turn out to be statistically different, then it is publishable data. (I also agree that it appears to be a small sample size, but it is still large enough to show statistical differences if they exist. Also, this is the starting line for projects down the road that will be able to recruit more participants)\n4. I am completely approaching this study with an open mind, as are my colleagues. As a scientist, I want to look strictly at what the data tells me without any prejudice or bias. I understand any concern you may have relating to our \"agenda\" but I promise you, we do not have any.\nAnother important point is if you feel uncomfortable with any questions or portions of the study you may withdraw at anytime. This study is completely voluntary; we will never force you to do something or answer a question that you do not wish to.\nI hope that I answered all of your questions. Please let me know if you have any others and I will be happy to talk to you. If you decide to participate either send me a phone number to contact you with or call our other project coordinators Lydia Medeiros at (614)292-2699 or Janet Buffer at (614) 247-8388.\nThank you so much for your time and interest in our study!\nSincerely,\nLog in or register to post comments\nI responded to this letter in Don Neeper's posting at the OhioWAPF site as follows:\nWhat a sad joke this study is-- its embarassing for OSU-- and to think these poor kids think they are actually doing something.

However, it ought to be considered that enterococci can play a dual role in food safety. In fact, they may be used as protective cultures, being able to produce enterocins with activity against several pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium spp., which can be found in cheese products (Giraffa 2003). Moreover, some of these enterocins have been proved to be active against some Gram negative bacteria, which is quite unusual for bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (Khan et al., 2010). Recent studies demonstrate that during milk fermentation, some enterococci can produce peptides with Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity (Muguerza et al., 2006; Quirs et al., 2007); this feature is receiving special attention because of the key role of ACE in regulating the blood pressure.\"\nhttp://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/75/13/4273.pdf\n\"Enterococcus faecalis WHE 96, a strain isolated from soft cheese based on its anti-Listeria activity...

The fact that you, Bill Anderson, and others knowledgeable about the benefits of raw milk may be participating is encouraging news. Let's hope you can truly teach.\nDavid\nLog in or register to post comments\nKen King,\nMy source for that information on freezing was French master cheesemaker Ivan Larcher.\nSheep's milk is the one exception to this rule, because sheep's milk lacks indigenous lipase enzymes, and so can be frozen with fewer adverse effects on the properties of the milk. (It is still less than ideal to freeze sheep's milk... all milk is at its best when it is fresh and uncooled, still at body temperature of the dairy animal)\nHowever, in goat and cow milk, the principle is applicable to more than just freezing. I have learned this from a great variety of sources... very experienced people in the dairy industry.\nAnything which disrupts or punctures the butterfat membrane will expose the butterfat to the lipases (lipid degrading enzymes) contained within the serum (water phase) of raw cow and goat milk.\nPumping, agitation, violent handling of the milk (such as milk hitting the wall of a bulk tank at high velocities out of the milk pipeline), as well as high somatic cell counts, all tend to increase the Acid Degree Value (ADV) of milk.\nADV is a labratory measure of rancidity in the butterfat. However, disrupted fat membranes are easily identified by a well-trained cheesemaker, even before they turn rancid. They form a fine \"mist\" of fat globules which appear on top of the milk in the vat, and are lost to the whey when the cheese is made.\nAlso, a trained judge of dairy products can easily detect rancid butterfat by taste and aroma. This flavor is considered desirable in some varieties of industrially produced cheese -- asiago, romano, provolone, feta, and certain types of blue cheese. For most mass-produced cheese, the lipase enzymes are added to the milk after it has been pasteurized. There are even some raw milk blue cheeses in which a portion of the milk is intentionally homogenized to disrupt the butterfat globules, exposing them to the natural lipases in the raw milk, in order to promote lipolytic rancidity.\nHowever, for a traditional raw milk cheese such as genuine French Roquefort, the natural lipolytic reactions occurs by the action of the blue molds indigenous to the natural caves in which the cheeses are aged, and so the free fatty acids created are a more subtle, profound, and complex flavor than the industrially produced blue cheeses.\nwho: Bill Anderson | when: Tue, 10/19/2010 - 02:56 |\nLog in or register to post comments\nKen, here are some links with more information for you. They are essentially saying the same thing I said above.\nhttp://www.das.psu.edu/research-extension/dairy/pdf/milkflavor.pdf\nRANCID FLAVOR\nBacterial degradation results from bacteria that get into the milk upon contact with improperly washed or sanitized equipment, from external contamination, and is made worse by improper cooling. Infection of cows should not be considered as a source of high bacteria counts until all other causes have been eliminated.\nChemical defects can occur both before and after milking. The cowy or ketone flavor is the result of the animal suffering from ketosis. A foreign flavor can be caused by medications, a reaction to pesticides, disinfectants, or any number of contaminants. Rancidity and oxidation result from the degradation of milkfat.\nA soapy-bitter taste is identifiable with rancidity. There appears to be a seasonal affect with the months between July and September having the highest occurrences. Rancidity is caused by a chemical development, which continues until the milk is pasteurized. It involves lipase and other enzymes, which react with the milkfat to form free fatty acids. The key to prevention is to have intact membranes around milkfat globules. Causes of rancid flavor are those things that result in weakened or broken milkfat globule membranes.\nSome farm related causes include:\n1. Lack of adequate protein in the diet.\n2. Not feeding enough total energy for the level of milk produced.\n3. Milking cows longer than 305 days.\n4. Added stress when milking cows more than two times per day.\n5. Air leaks in pipeline milkers.\n6. Flooding of pipelines and receiver jars.\n7. Partial or less than every other day collection of milk from farms.\n8. Freezing in the bulk tank.\n9. Over agitation in the bulk tank.\nSome non-farm related causes include:\n1. Holding raw milk in processing plants more than 48 hours after collection.\n2. Failure to empty and wash raw milk storage tanks every processing day.\n3. Air leaks in pipes.\n4. Running pumps in a starved condition.\n5. Homogenization prior to pasteurization.\nhttp://www.cals.cornell.edu/cals/foodsci/extension/upload/mqipvsl-tests.doc\nAcid Degree Value (ADV) is an indicator of the potential for rancid flavor in milk. It is an estimate of the level of free fatty acids (FFA), which occur as the result of the enzymatic breakdown (lipase) of butterfat. High levels of certain FFAs result in a rancid flavor in milk. ADVs of greater than 1.0 might be perceived as rancid. As the ADV exceeds 1.4, the flavor criticism may range from \"lacks freshness\" to \"rancid/unclean\" depending on the individual tasting the milk. Most causes of high ADVs occur on the farm through excessive agitation of the milk. Pasteurization inactivates most of the natural lipase in milk, thus minimizing the development of rancidity, though ADVs may rise slowly during storage. Mixing pasteurized homogenized milk with raw milk will cause rancidity. ADVs may also increase as the SPC increases to spoilage levels.\nwho: Bill Anderson | when: Tue, 10/19/2010 - 03:19 |\nLog in or register to post comments\nDavid,\nYou are too negative toward Don, IMHO.

I especially get this feeling when one or another provide commentary on investing in precious metals.\nThe current issue of Forbes is a case in point. One of its professional investor columnists writes , \"Gold is supposed to be an anchor of stability in uneasy times. Currencies can collapse, stock markets can crash, bonds can default, but that yellow stuff is there forever. And so you are expected to put some portion of your retirement assets...in gold. I am going to try to talk you out of this...I think the best way to contend with these uncertainties over a quarter of a century is with a well-diversified portfolio of cheap index funds...Skip the precious-metals allocation.\"\nIn other words, having forsaken the \"index funds\" for something like gold would have been dangerous, highly risky, in the view of this \"professional.\" No matter that a $10,000 investment in gold in the year 2000 would have increased to $50,000 today, while the same $10,000 invested in a fund mimicking the Dow Jones Industrial Average would still be worth about $10,000 (in dollars that are depreciating practically before our eyes).\nTen-year trend in gold prices, 2000-2010Sound familiar? Sort of like the \"professionals\" who tell us that consuming unpasteurized dairy is so terribly risky, when the government's own data actually tell us it isn't particularly risky.\u00a0 In both arenas, the professionals hollering fear and danger so vastly outnumber those preaching calm and reason that most of the public accepts the conventional wisdom as gospel.\nI got to thinking about the comparison between investing and eating a few days ago, when I read that Ohio State University is planning a study about why people drink raw milk. It is looking for 60 raw milk drinkers (as well as 60 pasteurized milk drinkers) to answer questions, fill out some forms, and provide samples of the milk they drink, to be examined for fat content. One of the scientists quoted in the Ohio State press release about the study states, \"We truly do not know very much about how people make the choice to drink raw or pasteurized milk -- there's just nothing in the literature,\" How about that, there's nothing in the literature. Maybe because the scientists have been so busy trying to scare people from drinking raw milk.\nI'm certainly open to the public health community and the government wanting to learn more about why increasing numbers of people are drinking raw milk, and maybe, radical thought, what the nutritional benefits of raw milk might be. Don Neeper, an Ohio raw-milk activist who comments here, wrote me that he has been told by one of the scientists at Ohio State that the team is \"committed to running an impartial study.\"\nThat would be quite something in itself, since the study's \"principal investigator\", Jeffrey LeJeune, is a professor who last year published an article about the dangers of raw milk consumption in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, entitled, \"Unpasteurized Milk: A Continued Public Health Threat\".\nIt concluded: \"Given that milk is derived from animals, it inherently carries the risk of being contaminated with pathogens from its source (cattle, goats, sheep, and the farm environment). The key factor in the prevention of milkborne disease is consumer avoidance of raw milk consumption. In an effort to protect human health, a number of organizations have published guidelines and statements concerning milk pasteurization. The American Medical Association (policy H-150.980) [67] clearly asserts that milk sold for human consumption should be pasteurized. Likewise, the American Veterinary Medical Association asserts that only pasteurized milk and milk products should be sold for human consumption [68]. Thus, physicians, veterinarians, and dairy farmers who promote, or even condone, the human consumption of unpasteurized milk and dairy products may be at risk for subsequent legal action.\" Yes, the old \"Say-something-good-about-raw-milk-and-I'll-sue-you routine.\" I thought you had to be a lawyer to use that trick.\nNeeper is inclined to cooperate with the study, and that makes sense\u00a0 (though I imagine the scientists could find out pretty quickly why raw milk drinkers do what they do, and save a bunch of dough, by attending a local Weston A. Price chapter meeting). The whole thing has something of the flavor of a British anthropologist heading out to study the indigenous population in one of the empire's colonies 100 years ago--hold my nose and try to figure out what these uncivilized wretches are like so I can write my paper.\nI can't imagine someone like LeJeune could come up with more negatives about raw milk than he has already, except maybe to conclude that drinkers are clinically deranged. More likely, he'll be like the professional investors who continue to disparage investing in gold--he won't let something so mundane as the facts interfere with his view of the world.\nMaybe the discussion on outsourcing following my previous post didn't result in the butter sticker plan Amanda Rose liked being implemented by Organic Pastures Dairy Co., but it certainly was civil and substantive. Perhaps an acknowledgment by all concerned, including me, that outsourcing for providers of premium nutrient-dense foods is an important matter. Consumers need to get as close to their food as possible. Suppliers need to be especially careful, and transparent. Sure, Lykke and Amanda may have different perspectives, but the conversation with Mark McAfee was amazingly substantive, and he was as responsive and forthcoming as any company president could be.\nI'll add that I agree with Lykke that the Weston A. Price Foundation would do well to revise its account of the 2006 illnesses blamed on Organic Pastures. The WAPF account seems to blame spinach and antibiotics, when it says a recall of OPDC milk \"occurred during the midst of the spinach contamination scare and seemed to be aimed at deflecting attention from the huge problems of E.coli O157:H7 contamination in produce. The state claimed that five raw milk-drinking children became ill, two of whom were hospitalized, given antibiotics and almost died. (The other three received no antibiotics and recovered quickly.)\"\nOn the political front, there's something interesting happening in Iowa.

In other words, propaganda development. -- also my comment at Marler's blog.\nThere was a similar study in Wisconsin and California and those were worthless.\nThe OSU planned study is a joke. Here is a statement given to Don Neeper earlier today by the research assistant.\nHello Mr. Neeper,\nI am a graduate student at Ohio State working on my thesis involving the raw milk study you inquired about. Dr. Medeiros forwarded your email along to me since I am in charge of coordinating the participants in the study so hopefully I can answer all of your questions.\nIn general our study will consist of a focus group, survey, 4 day food record, and a milk sample. The focus group will consist of either pasteurized milk drinkers or raw milk drinkers. This will even further be broken down based on whether you live on a dairy farm or not. We want there to be free and open conversation among all focus group participants, so we will keep the milk groups separated so everyone will feel comfortable. The survey, food record and test tubes will be sent home with participants after the focus group and the individuals will be instructed to select an appointment time for the health assessment the following week. During the appointment time the health assessment will be conducted privately as well as reviewing the food record for completeness. In total we expect each day to take about 1 to 2 hours.\nTo specifically address your questions:\n1. We will be freezing the milk samples shortly after receiving them at -30 degrees. I will only be extracting fat from each sample and analyzing the fat content and composition of the milk samples (both raw and pasteurized). We are asking for a sample of milk that you drink as well as the milk as it is in the container. There also will be another test tube that will be collected and stored. Currently there are no plans for that sample's use and if anyone chooses to use it in the future, they must first get your consent to be able to do so. So if you choose to participate and provide us with a milk sample you are only giving us permission to examine the fat content and composition, nothing else.\n2. The health assessment will include height, weight, waist circumference and something else called a sagittal abdominal diameter. We are looking primarily at BMI and central adiposity. There is a certain fat in milk that has been shown to have some affect on central adiposity so we wanted to see if there was any correlation between the amount in the milk and central adiposity. But there is nothing more invasive than simple measurements.\n3. There are many comparisons to make from this study. The focus groups and most of the survey will compare thoughts, behaviors, motivations, barriers, and reasons related to milk choices. The food record will compare overall dietary intake of the individuals, looking specifically at fat, vitamin D and calcium intake. The milk sample will compare the specific fatty acid profile of the milk including the fat percentage. And the health assessment will allow us to compare BMI and central adiposity between groups. Many of these will then be compared against each other, like health assessment and fatty acid profile, or dietary intake and health assessment. We do ask demographic information on our survey, but our objective is not to compare education levels, income, etc. However, if these turn out to be statistically different, then it is publishable data. (I also agree that it appears to be a small sample size, but it is still large enough to show statistical differences if they exist. Also, this is the starting line for projects down the road that will be able to recruit more participants)\n4. I am completely approaching this study with an open mind, as are my colleagues. As a scientist, I want to look strictly at what the data tells me without any prejudice or bias. I understand any concern you may have relating to our \"agenda\" but I promise you, we do not have any.\nAnother important point is if you feel uncomfortable with any questions or portions of the study you may withdraw at anytime. This study is completely voluntary; we will never force you to do something or answer a question that you do not wish to.\nI hope that I answered all of your questions. Please let me know if you have any others and I will be happy to talk to you. If you decide to participate either send me a phone number to contact you with or call our other project coordinators Lydia Medeiros at (614)292-2699 or Janet Buffer at (614) 247-8388.\nThank you so much for your time and interest in our study!\nSincerely,\nLog in or register to post comments\nI responded to this letter in Don Neeper's posting at the OhioWAPF site as follows:\nWhat a sad joke this study is-- its embarassing for OSU-- and to think these poor kids think they are actually doing something.

However, it ought to be considered that enterococci can play a dual role in food safety. In fact, they may be used as protective cultures, being able to produce enterocins with activity against several pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium spp., which can be found in cheese products (Giraffa 2003). Moreover, some of these enterocins have been proved to be active against some Gram negative bacteria, which is quite unusual for bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (Khan et al., 2010). Recent studies demonstrate that during milk fermentation, some enterococci can produce peptides with Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity (Muguerza et al., 2006; Quirs et al., 2007); this feature is receiving special attention because of the key role of ACE in regulating the blood pressure.\"\nhttp://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/75/13/4273.pdf\n\"Enterococcus faecalis WHE 96, a strain isolated from soft cheese based on its anti-Listeria activity...

The fact that you, Bill Anderson, and others knowledgeable about the benefits of raw milk may be participating is encouraging news. Let's hope you can truly teach.\nDavid\nLog in or register to post comments\nKen King,\nMy source for that information on freezing was French master cheesemaker Ivan Larcher.\nSheep's milk is the one exception to this rule, because sheep's milk lacks indigenous lipase enzymes, and so can be frozen with fewer adverse effects on the properties of the milk. (It is still less than ideal to freeze sheep's milk... all milk is at its best when it is fresh and uncooled, still at body temperature of the dairy animal)\nHowever, in goat and cow milk, the principle is applicable to more than just freezing. I have learned this from a great variety of sources... very experienced people in the dairy industry.\nAnything which disrupts or punctures the butterfat membrane will expose the butterfat to the lipases (lipid degrading enzymes) contained within the serum (water phase) of raw cow and goat milk.\nPumping, agitation, violent handling of the milk (such as milk hitting the wall of a bulk tank at high velocities out of the milk pipeline), as well as high somatic cell counts, all tend to increase the Acid Degree Value (ADV) of milk.\nADV is a labratory measure of rancidity in the butterfat. However, disrupted fat membranes are easily identified by a well-trained cheesemaker, even before they turn rancid. They form a fine \"mist\" of fat globules which appear on top of the milk in the vat, and are lost to the whey when the cheese is made.\nAlso, a trained judge of dairy products can easily detect rancid butterfat by taste and aroma. This flavor is considered desirable in some varieties of industrially produced cheese -- asiago, romano, provolone, feta, and certain types of blue cheese. For most mass-produced cheese, the lipase enzymes are added to the milk after it has been pasteurized. There are even some raw milk blue cheeses in which a portion of the milk is intentionally homogenized to disrupt the butterfat globules, exposing them to the natural lipases in the raw milk, in order to promote lipolytic rancidity.\nHowever, for a traditional raw milk cheese such as genuine French Roquefort, the natural lipolytic reactions occurs by the action of the blue molds indigenous to the natural caves in which the cheeses are aged, and so the free fatty acids created are a more subtle, profound, and complex flavor than the industrially produced blue cheeses.\nwho: Bill Anderson | when: Tue, 10/19/2010 - 02:56 |\nLog in or register to post comments\nKen, here are some links with more information for you. They are essentially saying the same thing I said above.\nhttp://www.das.psu.edu/research-extension/dairy/pdf/milkflavor.pdf\nRANCID FLAVOR\nBacterial degradation results from bacteria that get into the milk upon contact with improperly washed or sanitized equipment, from external contamination, and is made worse by improper cooling. Infection of cows should not be considered as a source of high bacteria counts until all other causes have been eliminated.\nChemical defects can occur both before and after milking. The cowy or ketone flavor is the result of the animal suffering from ketosis. A foreign flavor can be caused by medications, a reaction to pesticides, disinfectants, or any number of contaminants. Rancidity and oxidation result from the degradation of milkfat.\nA soapy-bitter taste is identifiable with rancidity. There appears to be a seasonal affect with the months between July and September having the highest occurrences. Rancidity is caused by a chemical development, which continues until the milk is pasteurized. It involves lipase and other enzymes, which react with the milkfat to form free fatty acids. The key to prevention is to have intact membranes around milkfat globules. Causes of rancid flavor are those things that result in weakened or broken milkfat globule membranes.\nSome farm related causes include:\n1. Lack of adequate protein in the diet.\n2. Not feeding enough total energy for the level of milk produced.\n3. Milking cows longer than 305 days.\n4. Added stress when milking cows more than two times per day.\n5. Air leaks in pipeline milkers.\n6. Flooding of pipelines and receiver jars.\n7. Partial or less than every other day collection of milk from farms.\n8. Freezing in the bulk tank.\n9. Over agitation in the bulk tank.\nSome non-farm related causes include:\n1. Holding raw milk in processing plants more than 48 hours after collection.\n2. Failure to empty and wash raw milk storage tanks every processing day.\n3. Air leaks in pipes.\n4. Running pumps in a starved condition.\n5. Homogenization prior to pasteurization.\nhttp://www.cals.cornell.edu/cals/foodsci/extension/upload/mqipvsl-tests.doc\nAcid Degree Value (ADV) is an indicator of the potential for rancid flavor in milk. It is an estimate of the level of free fatty acids (FFA), which occur as the result of the enzymatic breakdown (lipase) of butterfat. High levels of certain FFAs result in a rancid flavor in milk. ADVs of greater than 1.0 might be perceived as rancid. As the ADV exceeds 1.4, the flavor criticism may range from \"lacks freshness\" to \"rancid/unclean\" depending on the individual tasting the milk. Most causes of high ADVs occur on the farm through excessive agitation of the milk. Pasteurization inactivates most of the natural lipase in milk, thus minimizing the development of rancidity, though ADVs may rise slowly during storage. Mixing pasteurized homogenized milk with raw milk will cause rancidity. ADVs may also increase as the SPC increases to spoilage levels.\nwho: Bill Anderson | when: Tue, 10/19/2010 - 03:19 |\nLog in or register to post comments\nDavid,\nYou are too negative toward Don, IMHO.

In order to be called Cheddar, the cheese must go through a process called cheddaring - read on to find out what this involves.\nAnswer:\nThe short definition of cheddaring is that it's a step used during cheesemaking to give cheese a dense, layered texture. The process of cheddaring is used when making Cheddar cheese (of course) and a similar or identical process is also used when making cheeses that have a texture that is similar to Cheddar like Cheshire, Lancashire, Cantal and Colby.\nAfter curds form during the cheesemaking process , they are cut up into smaller pieces to expel liquid (whey). The smaller the curds are cut, the more liquid will drain from them and the harder the resulting cheese will be. This step is used when making almost all types of cheese, but it is taken one step further for cheddar cheese. To make cheddar, the curds are cut up and then pressed together into slabs and then the slabs of curds are stacked on top of each other. The weight of stacking the slabs of curds on top of one another presses out even more moisture. Then the slabs of curds are cut up again, pressed into slabs again and stacked again. The process continues until so much whey is expelled that that after aging, the cheese will have a crumbly, layered, dense texture.\nHaving trouble visualizing the process of cheddaring? Watch one of these videos about cheddaring:\nCheddaring at Hook's Cheddar\nMore About Cheddar\nCheddar cheese was first made in England but is now made pretty much everywhere. Cheddar has a flavor that is different from other types of hard and semi-hard cheeses due to the heating or \"cooking\" of the curds, the process of cheddaring, and the aging process. Beyond this, cheddar from different parts of the world tastes different because the flavor of the milk varies, the aging time varies and the skill level and techniques of the cheesemakers vary.\nTypes of Cheddar\nFarmhouse Cheddar: Cheddar made in England in the counties of Somerset, Dorset, Devon or Cornwall, although the name \"farmhouse\" has been co-opted by cheesemakers in other countries, too. The European Union recognized true farmhouse cheddar by awarding it PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) status. In addition to being English, true farmhouse cheddar is made entirely on the same farm (from gathering the milk to aging the cheese) and is aged at least 9 months. Read more on the official West Country Farmhouse Cheesemakers website\nBandage-Wrapped Cheddar: Cheddar that is wrapped in cheesecloth during the aging process. Cloth protects the outside of the cheese but also allows air in, creating a natural rind beneath the cloth.

Probably your producer DID pasteurize the milk you then bought.\nI guess that\u2019s why older moms always boiled the milk\u2026\nFrom wikipedia: ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization )\n\u201cProponents of unpasteurized milk make the argument that if milk is obtained from humanely raised cows that are grass fed and handled hygienically, then there is little problem with disease. However, raw milk can become contaminated in a number of ways: by coming into contact with cow feces or bacteria living on the skin of cows, from an infection of the cow\u2019s udder, or from dirty equipment, among others. Improperly handled raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalizations than any other foodborne disease outbreak, making it one of the world\u2019s most dangerous food products.[...] Diseases pasteurization can prevent include tuberculosis, brucellosis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and Q-fever; it also kills the harmful bacteria Salmonella, Listeria, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli O157:H7,[12][13] among others.\u201d\nWe are all familiar with salmonella and listeria.\nMilk from a cow fed organically, without medication and chemicals, probably does reduce allergies (because all those antibiotics result go in the milk and enhance allergies). However even the most organic cow can have bacteria in its feces and contaminate the milk. The fact that raw milk is produced organically and locally and you know the farmer, does not mean that bacteria are out of the way. On the contrary, organically raised cows where antibiotics are not used, can actually get sicker more easily. So let\u2019s make the distinction between organic milk and unpasteurized milk.\nHave a look on the net, there are lots of instructions on how to pasteurize milk at home. Which means that you can get your organic milk from your local farmer all right, just make sure you pasteurize it before you drink it.\nSara\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 7:35 am\nI lived in Africa when I was younger\u2026 we lived in a remote village, raw milk was all there was.

You\u2019re so lucky to have a close dairy. Anymore I\u2019m pretty leery of overly processed, or \u201csterlized\u201d products, I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t wash my hands when necessary, but having everything anti-bacterial, super clean etc. is just as unhealthy IMO.\nSandra\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 8:16 am\nI grew up on a dairy farm so that is all we every had and it is the best (especially on cereal).

As it is, we buy most of our eggs (organic, free range, and we keep returning our egg cartons for reuse) from a family friend.

A raw milk farmer is required to keep an ultra clean premises and must keep his cows healthy or his customers would quickly go away. Most of the \u201courbreak\u201d reports of illness from raw milk actually come from raw milk destined for pasteurization or pasteurized milk that was contaminated AFTER treatment. A recent government study on the 10 major sources of food-borne illness didn\u2019t even MENTION raw milk \u2013 the #1 source was industrial chicken.\nAnd it has been shown that with proper handling of clean raw milk, the enzymes and probiotics in it kill pathogens rather quickly (most raw milk farmers now take their own samples to send to an independent lab if/when the government claims an outbreak was caused by their milk \u2013 the government has resorted to lying and cheating to make it appear the milk was contaminated, like not storing the sample under proper conditions until pathogens take over. The savvy farmer, with his independent test taken from the same milk at the same time, can then prove his milk was not contaminated).\nI have been drinking raw milk for several years now, I can\u2019t tolerate store milk. It has only made me healthier, I can eat more and digest it better, I weigh less now than I did 10 years ago. I\u2019m 55, 5\u20191\u2033, and weigh about 108.\nSally\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 2:01 pm\nI love milk but am sadly lactose intollerant and now that I am a new mom and breastfeeding, my little baby can not handle if I have any type of milk products PERIOD.

Oh I miss it so much!\nKatie\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 3:23 pm\nWhen I was a teenager, I spent a few summers cliff-diving into cold, rapid rivers here in Oregon. It was one of the most exciting things I\u2019ve ever done in my life, and I did it countless times with not so much as a scratch to show for it. I loved the adrenaline rush, and the exercise and sunlight (rare in my part of the state for 10 months of the year) provided so many benefits for me physically and mentally. Does that mean what I did was wise or safe? Nope. Many people have been injured and even killed in the very spots where I jumped gleefully from the rocks.\nJust because people have done it \u2013 whether \u201cit\u201d is not using a child safety seat in a car (like when I was a baby), having an unassisted homebirth, or a number of other choices that people argue are safe based on their own anecdotal evidence \u2013 without negative effects does not mean that many others have not been harmed by the same practices.\nDo any of you have peer-reviewed, published research to support your confidence in the safety of your raw milk? I promise I\u2019m not trying to be snarky \u2013 I really want to know! If the research is ethical and well-supported, I want to read it! I\u2019d love for my family to gain the benefits of raw milk, but I won\u2019t do it until I can find peer-reviewed research that indicates that the benefits outweigh the risks.\nKatie\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 3:25 pm\nSandra (#25) \u2013 your info sounds great! Would you mind posting the source info so I can read the research? Thanks!\nTravis\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 3:32 pm\nBacteria and other microorganisms are a given. They keep you alive. Milk is not digested like a strawberry. There are complex happenings that have been developed over hundreds of thousands of years that create a relationship to milk and your gut. But life is always finding a way and there are always opportunists. Entropy is the rule. Milk is delicious and it will be invaded then beautifully broken down. But you can\u2019t keep up with bacteria by compromising your entire system by introducing something that can\u2019t be broken down properly, which is what happens when you destroy milk by killing everything inside it. Its a Jungle out there and we are creating mutants by sabotaging our allies\u2019 environments and turning them into enemies. Bacteria good. Fungus good. When something squeaks past Round Up ready corn and destroys the worlds grain system (since it is dangerously monopolized and uniform) or antibiotics in a lot of 100,000 cattle don\u2019t blame anyone but yourself for buying something from the depths of a horrible welfared experiment. Nothing is done like it was 20 years ago. And nothing is safe when life stock enter milking and killing fields shitting themselves with fear, literally.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that its raw. Buy something that was produced in a sane manner and give everyone a fighting chance to be able to safely eat\u2026Anything.\nKiminAZ\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 3:38 pm\nWhen I lived in VT I drank raw milk from my cousin\u2019s farm.

Now that I live in a place where dairy cows shouldn\u2019t roam (and mostly don\u2019t), my family has to drink store bought milk. Interestingly, I can\u2019t drink milk at all anymore. I feel as if I\u2019ve been hit in the stomach for hours if I even take a sip. I feel like I\u2019m going to vomit and I feel bad in general for at least 24 hours. The other thing that concerns me about store bought milk is how long it stays \u201cfresh\u201d. Have you ever seen how far out the expiration date is?

I\u2019d buy it frozen in baggies and my kids would guzzle it.\nAlison\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 4:12 am\nMy best friend is married to a dairy farmer here in Western NY. I can not get my self to drink the milk they do. I think it has something to do with having to shake it up before you pour it. Sorry not for me, I prefer almond milk or plain skim.\nLia\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 4:47 am\nDenise: Heating the milk and then freezing it = pasteurization. Probably your producer DID pasteurize the milk you then bought.\nI guess that\u2019s why older moms always boiled the milk\u2026\nFrom wikipedia: ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization )\n\u201cProponents of unpasteurized milk make the argument that if milk is obtained from humanely raised cows that are grass fed and handled hygienically, then there is little problem with disease. However, raw milk can become contaminated in a number of ways: by coming into contact with cow feces or bacteria living on the skin of cows, from an infection of the cow\u2019s udder, or from dirty equipment, among others. Improperly handled raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalizations than any other foodborne disease outbreak, making it one of the world\u2019s most dangerous food products.[...] Diseases pasteurization can prevent include tuberculosis, brucellosis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and Q-fever; it also kills the harmful bacteria Salmonella, Listeria, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli O157:H7,[12][13] among others.\u201d\nWe are all familiar with salmonella and listeria.\nMilk from a cow fed organically, without medication and chemicals, probably does reduce allergies (because all those antibiotics result go in the milk and enhance allergies). However even the most organic cow can have bacteria in its feces and contaminate the milk. The fact that raw milk is produced organically and locally and you know the farmer, does not mean that bacteria are out of the way. On the contrary, organically raised cows where antibiotics are not used, can actually get sicker more easily. So let\u2019s make the distinction between organic milk and unpasteurized milk.\nHave a look on the net, there are lots of instructions on how to pasteurize milk at home. Which means that you can get your organic milk from your local farmer all right, just make sure you pasteurize it before you drink it.\nSara\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 7:35 am\nI lived in Africa when I was younger\u2026 we lived in a remote village, raw milk was all there was.

A raw milk farmer is required to keep an ultra clean premises and must keep his cows healthy or his customers would quickly go away. Most of the \u201courbreak\u201d reports of illness from raw milk actually come from raw milk destined for pasteurization or pasteurized milk that was contaminated AFTER treatment. A recent government study on the 10 major sources of food-borne illness didn\u2019t even MENTION raw milk \u2013 the #1 source was industrial chicken.\nAnd it has been shown that with proper handling of clean raw milk, the enzymes and probiotics in it kill pathogens rather quickly (most raw milk farmers now take their own samples to send to an independent lab if/when the government claims an outbreak was caused by their milk \u2013 the government has resorted to lying and cheating to make it appear the milk was contaminated, like not storing the sample under proper conditions until pathogens take over. The savvy farmer, with his independent test taken from the same milk at the same time, can then prove his milk was not contaminated).\nI have been drinking raw milk for several years now, I can\u2019t tolerate store milk. It has only made me healthier, I can eat more and digest it better, I weigh less now than I did 10 years ago.

I loved the adrenaline rush, and the exercise and sunlight (rare in my part of the state for 10 months of the year) provided so many benefits for me physically and mentally.

Milk is not digested like a strawberry. There are complex happenings that have been developed over hundreds of thousands of years that create a relationship to milk and your gut. But life is always finding a way and there are always opportunists. Entropy is the rule. Milk is delicious and it will be invaded then beautifully broken down. But you can\u2019t keep up with bacteria by compromising your entire system by introducing something that can\u2019t be broken down properly, which is what happens when you destroy milk by killing everything inside it. Its a Jungle out there and we are creating mutants by sabotaging our allies\u2019 environments and turning them into enemies. Bacteria good. Fungus good. When something squeaks past Round Up ready corn and destroys the worlds grain system (since it is dangerously monopolized and uniform) or antibiotics in a lot of 100,000 cattle don\u2019t blame anyone but yourself for buying something from the depths of a horrible welfared experiment. Nothing is done like it was 20 years ago. And nothing is safe when life stock enter milking and killing fields shitting themselves with fear, literally.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that its raw.

As the article makes clear, the FDA, CDC, and AMA have branded raw milk as dangerous, even though people all over the world have been drinking it that way since time immemorial. How is that the entire population of India didn't become extinct before pasteurization?! Hmmm...\nThe article is full of valuable info on the health benefits of dairy in its original state, but it is also a reminder of the flaw in allopathic medicine in the broader sense. The dependence on the \"disease model\" often negates any discussion of true health. The FDA says pasteurized milk is non-pathogenic and therefore healthy. But for some of us the absence of germs in our food is not enough. We require that there also be some nutrients that the body is capable of using. Nature still makes food better than technology does, and raw milk is a prime example.\nAmong the health benefits of raw milk from pastured (grass fed) cattle is a reduction of allergy symptoms like asthma, hay fever, and eczema. A number of the subjects of the Salon article came to raw milk as a last resort for those afflictions and turned their conditions around. And as reporter Hannah Wallace points out:\nA compelling new study, published in the June 2006 issue of the Journal of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, seems to lend support to what these three already know to be true. Researchers at the University of London analyzed the diet of 4,700 children in Shropshire and found that those who lived on farms and drank raw milk had significantly fewer symptoms of asthma, hay fever and eczema. Children who drank raw milk were 40 percent less likely to develop eczema and 10 percent less likely to get hay fever than their non-raw-milk-drinking peers. Blood samples showed that they had 60 percent lower levels of immunoglobulin E, an antibody released by the immune system when it's confronted by allergens. (IgE, in turn, causes cells to release histamines, which is what causes an allergic reaction.) In their conclusion, study authors Michael Perkins and David Strachan surmised that the lactobacilli found in raw milk protect against eczema. They also stated, \"Unpasteurized milk is known to be rich in a variety of gram-negative species and their lipopolysaccharides, and it is plausible that a persistent exposure to a diverse milieu of bacteria from an early age is likely to have an effect on the developing immune system.\"\nFor some of us the worst allergy is to dairy itself. I was diagnosed as dairy allergic many years ago, and I noticeably react to dairy products... unless they're raw. Allergic reactions to food occur because the body can't digest and process them properly. Pasteurized milk is effectively dead and, in the attempt to kill off any lurking pathogens, all the enzymes necessary to its proper digestion are also killed. Raw dairy, rich in the enzymes and cultures nature intended, is far more digestible, which means the body can actually utilize its protein, vitamins, and nutrients.\nBreezing through some of the blog entries and letters in response to this article, I'm unsurprised to find that many people are just terrified of raw milk and sure that it's very, very dangerous. But as the article makes clear, E. Coli and other dangerous pathogens have been found in a number of foods that have not been made illegal; like spinach. Taco Bell hasn't been closed down, despite it's recent traffic in contaminated food. How is that the FDA is so quick to demonize raw milk, but rely on testing and regulation for other foods that are at least as likely to be contaminated? The answer probably lies in the demands of industrial agribusiness. Pasteurization is a blanket solution to the problems of mass produced milk from sick cattle.\n\"Pasteurization is an excuse to produce dirty milk,\" says Los Angeles raw milk activist Rahman Dalrymple, citing the outbreaks of salmonella, listeria and Campylobacter that have all been traced to pasteurized milk. In California, accepted bacteria levels for Grade A raw milk are fewer than 15,000 colony-forming units per milliliter; accepted levels for raw milk destined for pasteurization is 50,000. (Post-pasteurization, milk in California can contain 15,000 CFUs per milliliter. States that adopt the FDA's Pasteurized Milk Ordinance allow pasteurized milk 20,000 CFUs per milliliter, one-quarter more than California's raw-milk limit.) Dalrymple, who credits raw milk with curing his asthma, emphasizes that he would never drink raw milk that's destined for pasteurization by a large industrial dairy. Not all raw milk is created equal, Dalrymple says. \"Raw milk is dangerous -- if you get it from one of these industrial dairies that have fecal matter and pus and blood in their milk. I would absolutely not drink that!\"\nThis distinction -- between raw milk that's destined for pasteurization and raw milk from a small, spotlessly clean dairy that's kept to higher standards precisely because the milk won't be pasteurized -- is a crucial one, and it's lost on public health officials like Sheehan, who seem to lump all raw milk into the same pathogen-contaminated vat. Industrial farms are dirty -- as the recent agri-expos\u00e9s \"Fast Food Nation\" and \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\" have proved. When Sheehan thinks of raw milk, in other words, he's thinking of milk from cows crowded together in barns, eating a diet of corn, and standing in their own manure. All the raw milk advocates I spoke to are against drinking this type of raw milk.\nIn fact raw milk may be less likely to be infected with pathogens than it's mass produced, pasteurized counterpart, because pastured cattle, using their four stomachs the way nature intended, produce milk that naturally defends against contamination.\nAnother reason no pathogens have ever been found in his milk, McAfee believes, is that it contains a host of active antibacterial components -- not just proteins like lactoferrin, but enzymes, bacteriocins, colicins and at least 25 beneficial bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidus, the same probiotics that are found in most yogurt. And all of those components, McAfee says, are destroyed during pasteurization. (In her book \"Nourishing Traditions,\" WAPF founder Fallon concurs: \"Pasteurization destroys these helpful organisms, leaving the finished product devoid of any protective mechanism should undesirable bacteria inadvertently contaminate the supply.\") To prove his theory, a few years ago, McAfee sent his milk and colostrum to a private lab and had both injected with high levels of the three pathogens. The bacterial counts of all three bugs decreased over time. And the conclusion of the scientist at BSK Labs? \"Raw colostrum and raw milk do not appear to support the growth of Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, and Listeria monocytogenes,\" stated the lab report. McAfee is so proud of his below-normal bacteria counts that he posts annual averages on his Web site.\nThe exact opposite is true of the corn-fed cattle that are the stock-in-trade of big, commercial farms.\nCows, like all other ruminants, are meant to eat grass. Yet, at the vast majority of U.S. dairies -- even organic ones -- cows subsist on corn feed. In \"The Omnivore's Dilemma,\" Pollan explains how eating a high-starch diet acidifies a cow's rumen, making the animal sick and eventually allowing bacteria to enter its bloodstream. A cow's corn diet can also make us sick: E. coli O157:H7 has been around only since the early '80s, when it likely evolved in the acidic guts of corn-fed cattle. (E. coli O157:H7 is so lethal because human stomachs, too, are acidic. We can kill off microbes that evolve in the neutral pH of a grass-fed cow's rumen, but not the acid-resistant strains such as E. coli O157:H7.)\nI'm fortunate to live in a state where producing and selling raw dairy products is legal and the farms certified to bring it to market are scrupulously inspected. And let me tell you there is no going back once you've experienced what milk, yogurt, and cheeses are supposed to taste like... and digest like.\nMeanwhile, the FDA has just announced that it's safe to eat meat and drink milk from cloned animals. In such an Orwellian universe, where raw milk from cows that have two biological parents is considered dangerous, while pasteurized milk from cloned cows is safe -- is it any wonder that a growing band of consumers don't trust FDA decisions?\n"}, {"score": 312.96063, "uuid": "5bed2855-111f-54cd-bb8b-fe9dceb76030", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1301wb-05-03156", "target_hostname": "projectdisaster.com", "target_uri": "http://projectdisaster.com/index.php?s=e.+coli", "page_rank": 3.2949126e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "ProjectDisaster &raquo; Search Results &raquo; e. coli", "snippet": "Aren\u2019t raw or natural foods <em>better</em> <em>than</em> processed foods?

Martin Nitschke, M.D., of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Lubeck, Germany, and colleagues analyzed the duration of bacterial shedding in patients with this infection, comparing those who received azithromycin with those without antibiotic treatment. A substantial number of patients in this outbreak received prophylactic azithromycin treatment as part of a therapeutic regimen with the C5 antibody eculizumab. The study included 65 patients with STEC infection, including patients with HUS as well as STEC-infected outpatients without manifestation of HUS, between May 15 and July 26, 2011, and who were monitored for an average of 39.3 days after onset of clinical symptoms.\nThe initial azithromycin-treated group included 22 patients, and the control group included 43 patients without antibiotic treatment. On average, patients treated with azithromycin started therapy 11.8 days after the onset of clinical symptoms. There were no significant differences in the age or sex distributions between the groups.\nThe researchers found that the number of STEC carriers was significantly lower among patients treated with azithromycin. \u201cAt day 21, rates of STEC carriage were 31.8 percent in the initially treated group and 83.7 percent in those not treated. Long-term carriage (at day 28) was 4.5 percent in the treated group and 81.4 percent in the untreated group. At day 35, no patient in the treated group was a STEC carrier and all patients remained STEC-negative after the completion of 14 days of treatment. In contrast, 25 of 43 patients (57.7 percent) in the control group were STEC carriers at day 42 after onset of clinical symptoms.\u201d\nAdditionally, the observation of rapid clearance of STEC in stool specimens among azithromycin-treated patients and the high rate of long-term STEC carriage in the control group led to the decision to provide azithromycin treatment for 15 patients with remaining symptoms. After completion of treatment, all patients had at least 3 STEC-negative stool specimens.

L (+) tartrate + infections associated with pet turtle exposures. Turtles have long been recognized as sources of human Salmonella infections and are a particular risk to young children ( 1 ). Although the sale or distribution of small turtles (those with carapace lengths <4 inches [<10.2 cm]) has been prohibited in the United States since 1975 (with exceptions for scientific or educational purposes) (2), they are still available for illegal purchase through transient vendors on the street, at flea markets, and at fairs.\nDuring August 5, 2010\u2013September 26, 2011, a total of 132 cases of human Salmonella Paratyphi B var. L (+) tartrate + infection were reported in 18 states. The median age of patients was 6 years (range: <1\u201375 years), 66% were aged <10 years, and 63% were female. No deaths were reported. Of the 56 patients interviewed, 36 (64%) reported turtle exposure. For 15 patients who could recall the type of turtle contacted, 14 identified turtles too small to be legally traded. Five samples of turtle tank water from patient homes tested positive for the outbreak strain (four from Pennsylvania and one from South Carolina). Investigation to trace the source of these turtles is difficult because the vendors are transient. These cases illustrate that small turtles remain a source of human Salmonella infections, especially for young children.\nAlthough many reptiles carry Salmonella, small turtles pose a greater risk to young children because they are perceived as safe pets, are small enough to be placed in the mouth, and can be handled as toys. Despite a 30-year ban on small turtles, this ongoing outbreak suggests that ban enforcement efforts, as well as public education efforts, have not been fully successful and should be examined. In 2010, in response to a 2007 lawsuit filed by the Independent Turtle Farmers of Louisiana, Inc. seeking to overturn the ban, a federal district court upheld the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s authority to enforce the ban (3). Regulating the sale of small turtles likely remains the most effective public health action to prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis (4,5).\nReferences\nCode of Federal Regulations.

Why?\nWhy raw milk is suppressed\nIt is because the larger scale corporate-controlled dairies requires pasteurization to effectively deliver milk over long distances and time spans but which denatures the milk.\nIf the public got wind just how unhealthy pasteurized milk is in comparison to raw milk, it would spell an economic disaster for the larger dairies. So it is vital, or more accurately it is absolutely necessary, to keep up the marketplace lie and at all costs \u2013 no matter who is harmed in the public or among producers and distributors on the chopping block.\nRecently in California the government attempted to make it a multiple-felony to sell raw milk!\nTruth about raw milk comes out\nThese agencies, in collusion and support of corporate interests, won\u2019t admit any of the foregoing. But the CDC has come forth with the fact, being subjected to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) inquiry, that not a single person has died from raw milk consumption in over a decade!\nPrevious lies about raw milk dangers exposed\nAll the propaganda and fear-mongering about alleged severe dangers of raw milk would make one think otherwise. After petitioning the CDC for clarification about its raw milk statistics, Mark McAfee, owner of Organic Pastures Dairy Company (OPDC) in California, finally threatened to file a FOIA request. He then received a response from an unidentified official that the single \u201craw milk\u201d death that occurred between 1998-2008 was actually linked to illegal raw queso fresco cheese.\nAs to a second fear-mongered-about death, the agency has not come forth as to whether it was from similar causes. If it did, it would expose them to admitting they had lied all this time to the public.\nRefusal to discuss pasteurization health risks\nAt the same time, the CDC\u2019s avoidance of discussing the dangers of pasteurized milk is glaring.\u00a0 In 2006 alone, over 1,300 people got sick from pasteurized milk in California alone\u2013 and yet the CDC only highlights 39 reported illnesses every year linked to raw milk. Most of these links are likely questionable because raw milk has so many health benefits over pasteurized.\nResources:\n"}, {"score": 309.75308, "uuid": "363ad75a-a43f-5683-a273-19e5fa9391a4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0913wb-56-29582", "target_hostname": "www.dairyherd.com", "target_uri": "http://www.dairyherd.com/dairy-resources/hot-topics/Ag-survey-compares-states-raw-milk-regs-125978363.html", "page_rank": 1.1894912e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Ag survey compares states' raw milk regs Hot Topics", "snippet": "Despite warnings about the health risks associated with raw milk, raw-milk advocates say they prefer raw milk over <em>pasteurized</em> milk because it&#x27;s &quot;more natural,&quot; and <em>tastes</em> <em>better</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Raw milk linked to most dairy-related disease outbreaks\nDespite ongoing battles over state laws governing raw milk, the number of states allowing on-farm or retail sales of raw milk for human consumption remains the same now as three years ago, according to a recent survey\u00a0conducted by the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture .\nclick image to zoom\nRaw milk is milk that hasn't been pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella.\nThe results of the survey show that 30 states still allow the sale of raw milk for human consumption, and 20 states prohibit it -- the same numbers and the same states as those in the survey the association conducted in 2008.\nBut what has changed in the past three years is that five states -- New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Idaho, Vermont and South Dakota -- have adopted stricter standards for how free of bacteria the raw milk must be. In Idaho, for example, the raw-milk producers and the Idaho Dairy Association and milk processors hammered out a compromise that doubled the strength of the state's previous standard for raw milk.\nThe survey, which was conducted from April 22 through the end of June, in cooperation with the National Association of Dairy Regulatory Officials, marks the third such survey the association has done. As has been the case in previous years, the surveys are conducted based on interest in the various state laws governing raw-milk sales, as well as on public health concerns about raw milk on the part of state health departments and federal agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nUnder federal law, raw milk for human consumption cannot be sold across state lines.\nBob Ehart, public policy director and food-safety official with NASDA, told Food Safety News that the association usually conducts a raw-milk survey every four years. But because of the recent passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act, along with ongoing attempts in some states to have laws pertaining to raw milk changed, the association decided it would be better to gather updated information about current state laws as soon as possible.\nThe survey did not include herd shares. Under a herd-share arrangement, the consumer purchases a \"share\" of a cow (or goat or sheep) and in return receives a portion of the milk produced.\nEach state has its own approach to herd shares. In Colorado, for example, herd shares are allowed with no testing or inspections required, although the producer must register with the state. In Washington state, herd shares are also allowed but the producer must be licensed by the Washington State Department of Agriculture. Licensing requires milk testing and inspections by the department.\nHawaii and Rhode Island did not participate in the survey. However, the association's press release said that information collected from a third-party source indicated that raw milk sales in Hawaii are illegal, as was the case in 2008. In Rhode Island, they are legal, in some specified manner, as was the case in 2008.\nSurvey results\nHere's a rundown of the recent survey's results, according to the information submitted by the states to a questionnaire from the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture.\nOn the farm\nThirteen states -- Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, and Wisconsin -- \u00a0restrict legal sales to the farm where the milk is produced.\nFour of these states -- Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, and Illinois -- further restrict sales to only \"incidental occurrences\" (occasional sales, not as a regular course of business; no advertising).\nFour of these states -- Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi and Rhode Island -- restrict sales to goat milk only, with Kentucky and Rhode Island also requiring a prescription from a physician.\nKansas allows sales directly to the consumer on the farm with minimal on-farm advertising.\nIn the stores\nEleven states -- Arizona, California, Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington -- \u00a0allow the sale of raw milk at retail stores separate from the farm.\nOf these, Utah requires the store to be owned by the producer, even though it can be located off the farm.\nVariations on a theme\nFive states -- Colorado, Oregon, Missouri, South Dakota and Vermont -- have \"unique\" regulations that don't fit in either of the two main farm sales or retail sales categories.\nFor example, Oregon allows on-farm sales of raw cow's milk but only from farms with no more than two producing cows, nine producing sheep, and/or nine producing goats. But only goat milk is allowed to be sold retail off the farm.\nIn South Carolina, raw milk sales are legal on the farm and, to a limited extent, in retail stores. Farmers must obtain a permit and can sell only raw milk, not raw milk products. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control prohibits the sale of any processed raw dairy product. Advertising is legal.\nThree of the states -- South Dakota, Missouri, and Vermont -- allow varying methods of sales to consumers, for example, direct to consumers or at farmers markets, but not to stores. In the case of Vermont, raw milk may only be delivered directly to consumers' homes and is not allowed to be sold at farmers markets.\nColorado prohibits all sales of raw milk, but raw milk may be legally obtained through herd-share arrangements.\nHow clean is the milk?\nWhen regulators set standards for how clean milk should be, they use what are referred to as \"coliform counts\" as a guide.\nBased on information from the California Department of Food and Agriculture, coliforms are a group of bacteria commonly found in the environment -- for example, in the soil, surface water, vegetation, and the intestinal tracts of warm-blooded animals, among them milk-producing animals such as cows, goats, and sheep. And while most coliform bacteria do not cause disease, a small percentage of them can cause illnesses in people, especially young children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.\nExamples of these illness-causing coliform bacteria are E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella and Campylobacter, food poisons that can lead to serious health problems and, in severe cases, death.\nThe use of coliform counts as an indicator of sanitation has been a common tool in public health protection for many years. Elevated levels of coliforms in milk and dairy products suggest that the milk was produced, processed or packaged under unsanitary conditions.\nIn the case of raw milk, where pasteurization is not used to kill coliform bacteria, coliform counts reflect a farm's sanitation practices throughout milk handling, from the cow to final bottling.\nJason Kelly, spokesman for the Washington State Department of Agriculture, told Food Safety News that the presence of coliforms in food products does not indicate that disease-causing pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella are present. In fact, many foods contain low levels of harmless bacteria.\n\"But elevated coliform counts signal that the farm may need to improve its handling or manufacturing practices, said Kelly. \"If these unsanitary conditions continue, harmful pathogens may find their way into the foods, and consumers could be at risk for foodborne disease.\"\nThe Washington State Department of Agriculture also tests for harmful pathogens, said Kelly.\nWhen looking at coliform counts to gauge sanitation practices, a standard of no more than 10 coliform bacteria per milliliter (there are 946.4 milliliters in a quart of milk) conforms with standards set for pasteurized milk by the U.S. Food and Drug administration, the USDA, the Canadian Food Inspection Service, and the European Economic Community.\nHowever, Michele Jay-Russell, program manager at the Western Center for Food Safety, University of California, Davis , told Food Safety News that while coliform counts are an important tool, low coliform counts don't rule out the possible presence of pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella.\n\"It's a 'semi-crude' predictor, not a 'perfect predictor',\" Jay-Russell said, referring to coliform counts.\nState coliform standards\nAccording to NASDA's recent survey of state laws pertaining to raw milk, 11 states that allow the sale of raw milk at retail stores separate from the farm have coliform standards.\nEight of these states -- Arizona, California, Maine, New Hampshire, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington -- currently have a coliform standard of no more than 10 coliform bacteria per milliliter, which is equivalent to the national and some international standards for pasteurized milk.\nVermont and South Dakota, both of which allow farmers to deliver raw milk directly to consumers, at a farmers market, but not to stores, also have a coliform standard of no more than 10 coliform bacteria per milliliter.\nIn Oregon, where only raw goat milk can be sold retail, the coliform standard is also no more than 10 coliform bacteria per milliliter. However, in the case of a state exemption for micro- dairy producers for on-farm sales of raw milk in Oregon, there is no coliform standard.\nIdaho's coliform standard is no more than 25 coliform bacteria per milliliter.\nConnecticut and New Mexico have a coliform standard of no more than 50 coliform bacteria per milliliter.\nMissouri's coliform standard is no more than 100 coliform bacteria per milliliter.\nIn South Carolina, where raw milk is allowed to be sold on the farm, and to a limited extent in retail stores, the coliform bacteria standard is no more than 30 coliform bacteria per milliliter.\nMark McAfee, founder and CEO of Organic Pastures Dairy near Fresno, Calif., the largest organic raw-milk producer in the nation, gives a thumbs-up to those states that strengthened their standards for raw milk.\n\"That's very good news,\" he told Food Safety News. \"I'm very supportive of good state standards. Concern about pathogens (harmful bacteria) in milk is the area of most concern in public health.\"\nMcAfee said that demand for raw milk continues to grow. In fact, he's increased the size of his herd to 430 milking cows in response to an 18 percent increase in demand in 2010.\n\"The government needs to wake up and realize that it can't wish this away,\" he said. \"Instead of fighting against it, it should initiate food-safety plans for raw milk and include the producers in the dialogue.\"\nHe believes that the federal government's current point-blank opposition to raw milk creates a situation where people who can't get it legally are \"driven into the black market\" to get it. That can be risky because producers they buy from might not be following strict sanitation practices.\nLegislative forays\nRaw-milk advocates and producers in a handful of states tried various strategies this year to change the game plan in their states, but without success for the most part.\nFor example, in New Jersey , a bill to allow the sale of raw milk through a permit process overseen by the Agriculture Department came to the floor with a unanimous thumbs-up from the Agriculture Committee and sailed through the Assembly's lower house on a vote of 71 to 6, with one abstention.\nUnder the bill, dairies that obtain permits from the state Department of Agriculture could produce, sell and ship raw milk, which would be subject to quality standards and testing.\nIn March, the proposal was referred to the state Senate's Economic Growth Committee but didn't go anywhere from there.\nEven so, political gurus in the Garden State say the bill can't be written off as dead -- that it could be considered in the 2012 session.\nIn April, Texas state lawmakers held a hearing that went until almost midnight on a bill that would ease restrictions on raw milk and expand the places where it could be sold -- at farmers markets and county fairs, for example.\nBut as passionate as the testimony in favor of the bill may have been, the bill got stalled in the House Public Health Committee.\nIn Oregon, a bill, dubbed the \"Family Farm Act,\" included a provision to expand Oregon's current three-cow, nine-goat/sheep limit for raw-milk producers who undergo licensing and agree to conduct bacteria tests.\nThe bill failed to get enough traction to be voted on by the House Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee.\nIn Wyoming, the House Agriculture Committee voted 6-3 against a bill that would have allowed raw milk to be sold through herd-share agreements.\nSales of raw milk are illegal in Wyoming, although some farmers sell it \"under the table\" through informal herd-share agreements.\nIn Minnesota, no action was taken on a bill that would have permitted the sale of raw fluid milk products and raw milk cheese intended for humanconsumption through direct farm-to-consumer sales, including deliveries.\nIn Wisconsin, where Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle last year vetoed legislation that would have allowed farmers who test their dairy's milk monthly to sell raw milk (as long as no pathogens are found in it), new legislation has surfaced. The companion bills would allow a dairy farmer with a license and grade A permit to register with the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection for on-farm sales of unpasteurized milk and milk products.\nRepublican Gov. Scott Walker has indicated he will sign the bill, although he has said he wants more \"safety provisions\" than are provided in the measure as written.\nThe bill went through the process to get a fiscal note, and even though no committee action has been scheduled, it is still technically alive because \u00a0the Wisconsin Assembly does not adjourn until Dec. 31.\nHow safe is raw milk?\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , raw milk and raw milk products (such as cheeses and yogurts made with raw milk) can be contaminated with bacteria that can cause serious illness, hospitalization, or death.\nCDC warns that the risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk is greater for infants and young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer, an organ transplant, or HIV/AIDS, than it is for healthy school-aged children and adults. But, the agency also reminds people that it's important to remember that healthy people of any age can get very sick or even die if they drink raw milk contaminated with harmful germs.\nFrom 1998 through 2008, 86 outbreaks due to consumption of raw milk or raw milk products were reported to CDC. These resulted in 1,676 illnesses, 191 hospitalizations, and 2 deaths. Because \u00a0not all cases of foodborne illness are recognized and reported, the actual number of illnesses associated with raw milk likely is greater, according to CDC.\nThe agency is currently working on 2009 outbreak figures and expects to have them ready \"soon,\" a CDC spokesperson told Food Safety News.\nIn a more up-to-date look, Jay-Russell, Western Center for Food Safety, told Food Safety News that in her review of preliminary reports of outbreaks from 2010 to 2011 through this month, she found 17 raw-dairy-related outbreaks that caused 178 illnesses and 24 hospitalizations, compared with one pasteurized-dairy-related outbreak, which caused 23 illnesses and two hospitalizations.\n\"When compared side by side for that time period, there is an amazing disproportion of outbreaks, illnesses, and hospitalizations from raw vs. pasteurized milk,\" she said.\nDespite warnings about the health risks associated with raw milk , raw-milk advocates say they prefer raw milk over pasteurized milk because it's \"more natural,\" and tastes better. Many raw-milk advocates also believe it can help build immunity and prevent or cure health problems such as lactose intolerance, asthma, allergies diabetes, cancer and autism, among others, although according to the CDC there are no health benefits from drinking raw milk that can't be obtained from pasteurized milk. A recent Stanford University clinical trial refuted the notion that lactose intolerant individuals can consume raw milk without difficulties.\nThe CDC cautions that when looking at state laws and their relationship to illnesses caused by contaminated raw milk, states that allow the sale of raw milk and raw-milk products for human consumption have more raw-milk-related outbreaks of illness than states that do not allow raw milk to be sold.\nHannah Gould, a foodborne-disease expert with CDC, said that an analysis on this topic is expected to be published shortly.\nShe also explained that while there have been some outbreaks linked to pasteurized milk, those have been caused by contamination of the dairy products at some point after pasteurization, during food handling, for example, or sometimes at the retail level.\nGould said it's difficult to compare the number of outbreaks and illnesses associated with raw and pasteurized milk because far more Americans consume pasteurized dairy products. For example, FoodNet surveys of the general population have found that only 1 to 3 percent of Americans consume unpasteurized dairy products.\nFlorida attorney Pete Kennedy, president of the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund ,\u00a0told Food Safety News that despite outbreaks linked to raw milk, demand for raw milk keeps going up.\n\"Usually from what we see overall, news about outbreaks provides people with information about raw milk, and that gets their attention,\" \u00a0he said. \u00a0\"Ultimately demand goes up.\"\nHe also said that with more people interested in buying direct from the farm, \"raw milk often gets them out to the farm,\" and once they're there, they often \u00a0buy some of the farm's other products such as meat, produce and eggs.\nBut in looking at comparisons of food poisonings from raw milk with those from pasteurized milk, Jay-Russell, Western Center for Food Safety, cautions that raw milk appears to be disproportionately susceptible to pathogen contamination. \u00a0\"At this time, practical cost-effective interventions to protect raw milk from contamination are limited, and consumers should be very cautious or avoid purchasing these products,\" she said.\n"}, {"score": 306.8233, "uuid": "441470b8-4dbd-5a80-974e-e4fcdba4eb29", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1008wb-65-10087", "target_hostname": "www.tartedujour.com", "target_uri": "http://www.tartedujour.com/journal/?currentPage=8", "page_rank": 1.204338e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "tarte du jour - Tarte du Jour", "snippet": "Fortunately, it is very simple to make and <em>tastes</em> so much much <em>better</em> <em>than</em> store bought curd.

To guide you through our vast collection, we currently have multiple certified sommeliers, 2 of which are certified by the Court of Master Sommeliers.\nFriday, August 12, 2011\nHow Did You Learn About Wine?\nCertainly one of the most frequently asked questions on The Cliff House Restaurant\u2019s dining room floor, the purpose of this article is to help those who want to learn a little bit (or a lot) more about wine.\nMy personal journey involved 24 years in the food and beverage industry with 15 years devoted to fine dining and wine service \u2013 with a generous amount of sampling \u2013 purely in the interest of perfecting my trade, of course. Happily, there are far shorter paths that lead to a useful and pleasurable knowledge of wine.\nFirst and foremost, obviously, drink some wine. One of the beautiful aspects of our endeavor is that a good bottle of wine can be enjoyed without any knowledge of what it is, where it\u2019s from, or why it\u2019s good!\nStart with inexpensive bottles, and if you\u2019re serious, keep some notes regarding your impressions. Don\u2019t worry! With practice, you will refine your technique of communicating - to yourself and others - the emotional and visceral experience that is wine.\nTo achieve a better understanding of what is happening inside a particular bottle, some basic reference material can be invaluable. A little information will certainly deepen your appreciation and enjoyment of specific wines, and also aid you in making consistently good choices.\nStart with Andrea Immer Robinson\u2019s Great Wine Made Simple. This reference book demystifies traditional wine terminology, yielding immediately useful information in down-to-earth, everyday terms. Other good introductions are Windows on the World Complete Wine Course by Kevin Zraly (my first book) and Wine All-In-One For Dummies by Ed McCarthy, Mary Ewing-Mulligan, and Maryann Egan.\nFor the truly passionate, the wine-geeks, and anyone interested in wine certifications (that means an exam is on the way), I strongly recommend the following publications: How to Taste: A Guide to Enjoying Wine by Jancis Robinson, The World Atlas of Wine by Hugh Johnson, Sotheby\u2019s Wine Encyclopedia by Tom Stevenson, and The Oxford Companion to Wine, edited by (once again, and remember this name) Jancis Robinson. These books are not inexpensive, and even though some of the information will be out dated by the time it\u2019s printed - the world of wine is a moving target - the information they convey is essential to a higher wine education.\nAnother extremely helpful resource for advanced studies in wine is web sites and periodicals. I highly recommend the Sommelier Journal and its included web site. This magazine is geared towards professionals, offering timely and current information with out any filler or fluff. The Wine Spectator is also a useful magazine, although it generally has more advertising directed at the consumer.

To guide you through our vast collection, we currently have multiple certified sommeliers, 2 of which are certified by the Court of Master Sommeliers.\nFriday, August 12, 2011\nHow Did You Learn About Wine?\nCertainly one of the most frequently asked questions on The Cliff House Restaurant\u2019s dining room floor, the purpose of this article is to help those who want to learn a little bit (or a lot) more about wine.\nMy personal journey involved 24 years in the food and beverage industry with 15 years devoted to fine dining and wine service \u2013 with a generous amount of sampling \u2013 purely in the interest of perfecting my trade, of course. Happily, there are far shorter paths that lead to a useful and pleasurable knowledge of wine.\nFirst and foremost, obviously, drink some wine. One of the beautiful aspects of our endeavor is that a good bottle of wine can be enjoyed without any knowledge of what it is, where it\u2019s from, or why it\u2019s good!\nStart with inexpensive bottles, and if you\u2019re serious, keep some notes regarding your impressions. Don\u2019t worry! With practice, you will refine your technique of communicating - to yourself and others - the emotional and visceral experience that is wine.\nTo achieve a better understanding of what is happening inside a particular bottle, some basic reference material can be invaluable. A little information will certainly deepen your appreciation and enjoyment of specific wines, and also aid you in making consistently good choices.\nStart with Andrea Immer Robinson\u2019s Great Wine Made Simple. This reference book demystifies traditional wine terminology, yielding immediately useful information in down-to-earth, everyday terms. Other good introductions are Windows on the World Complete Wine Course by Kevin Zraly (my first book) and Wine All-In-One For Dummies by Ed McCarthy, Mary Ewing-Mulligan, and Maryann Egan.\nFor the truly passionate, the wine-geeks, and anyone interested in wine certifications (that means an exam is on the way), I strongly recommend the following publications: How to Taste: A Guide to Enjoying Wine by Jancis Robinson, The World Atlas of Wine by Hugh Johnson, Sotheby\u2019s Wine Encyclopedia by Tom Stevenson, and The Oxford Companion to Wine, edited by (once again, and remember this name) Jancis Robinson. These books are not inexpensive, and even though some of the information will be out dated by the time it\u2019s printed - the world of wine is a moving target - the information they convey is essential to a higher wine education.\nAnother extremely helpful resource for advanced studies in wine is web sites and periodicals. I highly recommend the Sommelier Journal and its included web site. This magazine is geared towards professionals, offering timely and current information with out any filler or fluff. The Wine Spectator is also a useful magazine, although it generally has more advertising directed at the consumer. Finally, for the certification-minded, I recommend a subscription to The Court of Masters web site, Guildsomme.com .

In 2006, experimental genetically engineered bentgrass, designed for golf courses, escaped from its test plot and within weeks had already spread several miles away, mixing with native grasses. The full impacts of this are still unknown. According to Tom Stohlgren, an ecologist at the US Geological Survey's National Institute of Invasive Species Science, the experimental bentgrass \"can tend to outcompete other species...It doesn't need to sexually reproduce - it's like The Blob.

A regular dose of apple cider vinegar, honey and water can help the body pass acid crystals, thus preventing and/or reducing muscle and joint stiffness, including pains due to arthritis. That same mixture has the benefit of thinning the blood, thereby reducing blood pressure. Apple cider vinegar can also aid digestion and kill harmful bacteria in the digestive tract. Pure apple cider vinegar can also be used to wash pesticides and bacteria or fungus off of fresh produce. Most commercial apple cider vinegars have been pasteurized and filtered, which destroys much of the inherent beneficial elements. Look for cold-pressed, unpasteurized and organic apple cider vinegar.\nQUOTE OF THE WEEK:\nDR.

People connected with environmental causes, in particular, are drawn to products like raw milk due to the connection with natural processes and as part of a local or animal-friendly diets. So we thought it worth exploring the facts: is raw milk better for you? Is it better for the animals? And what are the risks of drinking raw milk?\nOur quest to learn more starts at a dairy on the outskirts of Berlin, near where a wall once separated East from West. A piece of that wall now greets visitors to the Milchhof Mendler (Mendler Milk Farm), where a line of people snakes out of the small shop. Visitors can look into the stalls and visit cows ranging freely on the field behind the barn before joining the queue to wait for a portion of raw milk, filled directly to the customer's container. Each swing of the silver-chromed pump arm delivers a half a liter of creamy milk (4.2% milkfat).\nA framed sign behind the countertop, almost lost among the many framed awards received by the Mendler's milk and cows, advises consumers that the raw milk must be cooked before drinking. The law requires the warning, but the cartoon of the happy cow above the text almost winks at you while you read it.\nThe Taste Test\nMmmmm. I usually drink organic milk, but raw milk tops it. The cool, smooth nectar coats my mouth; an image of the milk moustache ad campaign springs to mind. This milk is about 0.4% higher in milkfat, which could explain partly why the taste blossoms so on the tongue. But there is something else: more texture, and a richness, a robust spectrum of flavors foreign to my heat-treated ken.\nAn interesting result in the next test though: the raw milk is not as good in coffee where the symphony of flavors native to each somehow fails to harmonize. Now I see where the habit of using only the cream in coffee arose!\nCows at the Mendler Milk Farm (photo: author)\nIs Raw Milk Better for You?\nIt should be mentioned that the greatest benefits from drinking milk derive from calcium, protein, vitamins and other minerals it contains. None of these nutrients is harmed by pasteurization.\nOne benefit of the raw milk is that producers willing to supply raw milk usually take a great deal of care with their animals. The use of hormones and chemicals is rare in this niche. But that benefit can be equally achieved by seeking out organic milk from a trusted supplier which pasteurizes their milk. So this must be considered more of a benefit of informed purchasing than of the untreated milk.\nActually, the only health benefit scientifically substantiated for raw milk is reduced susceptibility to allergies and asthma. The fact that farm children suffer less allergies and asthma has long been anecdotally observed, However, it could not be ruled out that other factors such as exposure to animals, dust and dirt in everyday life on a farm somehow exerts a protective effect, or that farm kids just complain less. That is, not until a study on raw milk and allergies conducted in Shropshire, England, and published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in June 2006.\nAfter controlling for effects from household pets, breastfeeding history, frequency of barn visits and hereditary influences, Michael R. Perkin, MSc, and David P. Strachan, MD, found that drinking raw milk specifically correlated with reduced positive responses to skin-prick tests for allergies. The finding is consistent with growing evidence that the immune system needs to be challenged by a wide variety of foreign agents -- such as the natural community of (mostly harmless) bacteria in raw milk -- or it will simply pick everyday agents to attack, resulting in the symptoms we classify as allergies or asthma. However, the effect requires consumption of raw milk as a child, and no one is going so far as to recommend this for young children who are at far higher risk for complications from the illnesses associated with raw milk. Concerned parents should first consider other \"pro-biotic\" products if they subscribe to this hypothesis for allergy prevention.\nWill Raw Milk Make Me Sick?\nThe population of harmless organisms in raw milk usually suffices to competitively suppress growth of harmful strains. (Note: to say that the good fauna in raw milk \"kill\" the bad bugs is a misinterpretation. They merely complete to multiply more successfully, so the bad bugs do not succeed to reach harmful levels.)\nNonetheless, a number of pathogens are associated with raw milk. Cases of disease attributed to raw milk can and do occur every year. Because the population drinking raw milk is small, the number of cases remains also below the health-scare radar. The most common ones are described in detail here.\nStaphylcoccus aureus: Most species of Staphylcoccus aureus are harmless. But some produce toxins which are the source of many cases of food poisoning after staph bugs multiply while infected foods are in storage. According to Medicinenet.com , victims suffer nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration, usually within one to six hours of consuming contaminated food. The illness is not contagious and usually resolves within three days without any treatment.\nCampylobacter: this bacterium is regarded as the most common source of food poisoning. According to the World Health Organization , campylobacter infections are on the rise in developed countries, for reasons unknown. The bacteria are widespread in livestock, and rarely cause illness in animals. But humans will suffer diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fever, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting for three to six days with onset between one and ten days after consuming the contaminated food. Like Staph poisoning, the symptoms will usually go away without treatment.\nSalmonella: a common cause of food poisoning, Salmonella symptoms and outcomes are much like those of Staphylcoccus aureus and Campylobacter.\nEscherichia coli: The risk of infection by e coli O157:H7 , is one of the main reason raw milk sales are banned or drinking raw milk discouraged. E. coli naturally inhabits everyone's intestines. But the particularly harmful O157:H7 strain of e coli is behind most of the headlines surrounding outbreaks of e coli related disease from infected lettuce, peanut butter or beaches. Victims take ill three to eight days after exposure, and suffer cramps and diarrhea for up to ten days. Most recover just fine, but according to WHO : \"It is estimated that up to 10% of patients with EHEC infection may develop HUS, with a case-fatality rate ranging from 3% to 5%. Overall, HUS is the most common cause of acute renal failure in young children. It can cause neurological complications (such as seizure, stroke and coma) in 25% of HUS patients and chronic renal sequelae, usually mild, in around 50% of survivors.\"\nListeria: causes miscarriage, premature birth and stillbirth. A terrible case occured in 2000-2001 in North Carolina, when five stillbirths, three premature deliveries and two infected infants resulted from consumption of fresh, soft-style cheese made from locally produced raw milk. In this case, the rule seems clear: pregnant women should not take risks with raw milk or raw milk products.\nYersinia: this relatively rare source of standard food poisoning symptoms can occasionally cause joint pain that lasts for months or years after onset of illness.\nBrucella: only a couple hundred cases occur in the U.S. each year. Characterized by a so-called 'undulating fever,' Brucellosis can lead to serious consequences and must be treated.\nMycobacterium tuberculosis: can triggering serious lung disease, although the illness is hard to catch. For example, of 42 people identified as drinking raw milk from a tuberculosis infected herd in Pennsylvania, none were found to be TB positive. On the other hand, it can happen: raw milk cheese was found to be the source of a tuberculosis outbreak in New York .\nWhat About the Laws?\nHere we must be really clear: regardless of the law in your area, raw milk should be sourced only from a trusted supplier. Crowded industrial farming methods and super-bugs due to overuse of antibiotics increases the risk of food contamination, also in the case of milk. Certainly, the production system is not capable of producing enough milk safely to replace pasteurized milk volumes, so 'safe raw milk' is by definition a niche product. This could explain the dedication of authorities in fighting any relaxation of laws regarding pasteurized milk. In fact, if it were decided to use ever higher levels of drugs to fight the nearly uncontrollable presence of bacteria associated with livestock, it would be decidedly worse for the environment than the use of pasteurization to control the risks.\nAdvocates for Raw Milk see their battle as a fundamental freedom of choice fight. It is hard to find grounds to disagree with that logic. Allowing the sale of raw milk does not force anyone to drink it. Quite the contrary, legalizing the sale of raw milk enables better control of animal health and testing for milk contamination in unpasteurized dairy products offered for human consumption. But like all slippery slopes, it could open the door to unsavory operators, pushing disease-ridden milk on the poorest consumers in the name of saving a few pennies on heat treatment.\nConclusion\nThe health risks are rare but real. The health benefits are unproven, with the only somewhat substantiated advantage requiring that the raw milk be consumed at young ages, when the offsetting health risks are higher. Risk-based analysis supports the continuation of strong warnings from responsible agencies to continue the practice of pasteurization. For populations that are pregnant, or likely to suffer more severely from the dehydration and depletion caused by even an ordinary food poisoning (especially young children or elderly or immune suppressed people), raw milk is a risk not worth taking.\nThe environmental benefits of raw milk can all be achieved by animal-friendly practices and minimized drug and chemical use. Pasteurization is certainly preferrable to the use of drugs to suppress disease causing bacteria in livestock populations sufficiently to equate to the protection pasteurization provides.\nBut raw milk does taste better. And many believe that there are as-yet unproven health benefits. The existence of a population willing to accept the risks is the only source of data if such benefits are ever to be proven. So viva the raw milk underground. May its heroes and martyrs long protect the freedom to choose.\n"}, {"score": 292.72928, "uuid": "b6bfe957-797c-5151-a4b3-585394f0842b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1113wb-58-15617", "target_hostname": "verdavivo.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://verdavivo.wordpress.com/tag/raw-milk/", "page_rank": 1.223752e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "raw milk &laquo; Verda Vivo", "snippet": "Unlike most of the milk, <em>cheese</em>, and dairy products sold in the United States, raw milk and raw dairy products have not been heat treated or <em>pasteurized</em> to kill germs.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tags: artificial colors , artificial sweeteners , high fructose corn syrup , hydrogenated oils , hydrolyzed soy protein , milk , pork , raw milk , shellfish , soft drinks , white flour , white sugar\nJordan Rubin , author of\u00a0 \u201cPerfect Weight America\u201d lists the \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d food items that we all should avoid for better health.

Pigs harbor a range of parasites and diseases that can be transmitted to humans. These include trichinosis, Taenia solium, cysticercosis, and brucellosis. Pigs are also known to host large concentrations of parasitic ascarid worms in their digestive tract.\u00a0 The presence of these diseases and parasites is one of the reasons why pork meat should always be well cooked or cured before eating. Religious groups that consider pork unclean refer to these issues as support for their views. Another reason not to eat pork is that factory hog farms are some of the worst polluters in America\u2019s history. See Boss Hog . While I\u2019m not a vegetarian, I\u2019ll think twice before buying any more pork.\nShellfish and crustaceans \u2013 Lobsters, crabs, shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters, crayfish and scallops are bottom scavengers or filter feeders. When I lived in Oregon, we would go upriver to swim and catch crayfish. I never thought much about what crayfish eat until my sister\u2019s dog pooped in the water. The crayfish went crazy, coming out of their hiding places from all over, to devour the tasty goodness. No more crayfish for me, thanks. Even though I love shrimp, I don\u2019t eat much of it after researching Poison Shrimp\u00a0Cocktail . And oysters, clams or mussels in Arizona? Not so much.\nProcessed meats and hydrolyzed soy protein \u2013 Processed meats contain nitrates for flavor, color and as a preservative. Steer clear of breakfast links, hot dogs, Salisbury steaks, bologna, sausages, salami, and lunch meats of all kinds. Nitrates can turn into nitrites which have been found to cause cancer and tumors in test animals. Hydrolyzed soy protein usually contains a significant amount of genetically modified soy. According to the FDA, hydrolyzed protein is used to enhance flavor and contains monosodium glutamate. When added this way, the labels are not required to list MSG as an ingredient. Yum.\nWhite flour \u2013 White flour is white because the wheat has been stripped of the wheat germ, bran, and half of the healthy fatty acids and then bleached. Enriched white flour just means that a few isolated and synthetic vitamins and minerals have been added back into the flour. Look for whole-grain breads or flour as a healthy alternative.\nHydrogenated oils \u2013 During the hydrogenation process, hydrogen gas in injected into oil under high pressure to make the oil solid at room temperature and prevent the oil from becoming rancid too quickly. The process produces trans fats. The consumption of trans fats increases one\u2019s risk of coronary heart disease by raising levels of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol and lowering levels of \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol. Health authorities recommend that consumption of trans fat be reduced to trace amounts. If the ingredient list contains the words \u201cshortening\u201d, \u201cpartially hydrogenated vegetable oil\u201d or \u201chydrogenated vegetable oil\u201d, then the food contains trans fat. Even if the label says \u201czero trans fat\u201d, the FDA allows manufacturers to have less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving and still legally use the term \u201czero trans fat\u201d. So much for truth in labeling.\nPasteurized, homogenized skim milk \u2013 This one surprised me. Instead of skim milk, Mr. Rubin recommends unpasteurized milk from grass-fed animals instead of homogenized, pasteurized milk. Since raw milk has risks based on the sanitary practices of the farm where it is produced, the next best thing is cultured or fermented dairy whole-milk products, such as yogurt and kefir. I\u2019ve often wondered why humans are the only species that drink the milk of another animal. That being said, I still have a nonfat latte every morning and love my cheese.\nWhite sugar \u2013 Sugar\u2013including sucrose, corn sweeteners, honey, and molasses\u2013is, in a sense, the number-one food additive. The average American eats up to three pounds of sugar every week. Of course, few people actually go through that much actual table sugar, but it is found in almost all of the processed foods we eat. It turns up in some unlikely places, such as pizza, bread, hot dogs, boxed rice mixes, soup, crackers, spaghetti sauce, lunch meat, canned vegetables, fruit drinks, flavored yogurt, ketchup, salad dressing, mayonnaise, and some peanut butter. Carbonated soft drinks are the worst offenders in the American diet.\nSoft drinks \u2013 Soft drink are empty calories with little or no nutritional value, considering most are made with high-fructose corn syrup. If you drink one can of soda per day, you will consume 55,000 extra calories in one year, or 15 pounds of weight gain. I find soft drinks too sweet for my taste. I\u2019d rather drink water.\nHigh-fructose corn syrup \u2013 Manufacturers use HFCS because it\u2019s cheap. You\u2019ll find it in soda, fruit juice, baked goods, canned fruits, dairy products, cooks, gum, jam, jellies, pickles\u2026you get the picture. The problem with HFCS is that the body handles fructose differently than all other sugars. Fructose does not stimulate leptin, the hormone that tell you \u201cI\u2019m full\u201d. In fat, it reduces ghrelin hormone levels, which tell you \u201cI\u2019m still hungry\u201d. Fructose propels the liver into fat-promoting mode by activating the formation of enymes that lead to elevated levels of \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol and triglycerides.\nArtificial sweeteners \u2013 As many as 194 million Americans regularly eat and drink sugar-free products. Whether or not artificial sweeteners are \u201csafe\u201d for our health, why consume an artificial product when a natural one if available? Plus, if they worked, why are so many Americans fat? I weaned myself from my Diet Mountain Dew habit over a year ago and feel much better as a result.\nArtificial flavors and artificial colors \u2013 Food additives have been linked to behavioral problems in children. They have also been associated with allergies and skin rashes. I dislike most prepared foods and normally shop the perimeter of the grocery store. I\u2019d rather eat my own cooking.\nBeer, wine and alcoholic drinks \u2013 This one pains me since I do like my glass of wine in the evening. However, his book was written for folks who are trying to lose weight and alcohol in all its forms is highly caloric. Of course there\u2019s the problems associated with excessive drinking.\nAll in all, I follow most of Mr. Rubin\u2019s recommendations. Combine that with daily exercise and I weigh within two pounds of my weight in high school. Never felt better.\nRelated posts:\n"}, {"score": 292.25122, "uuid": "bfacf665-74ed-5070-9e03-90fa5cd16a7b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1113wb-58-15618", "target_hostname": "verdavivo.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://verdavivo.wordpress.com/tag/shellfish/", "page_rank": 1.223752e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "shellfish &laquo; Verda Vivo", "snippet": "Unlike most of the milk, <em>cheese</em>, and dairy products sold in the United States, raw milk and raw dairy products have not been heat treated or <em>pasteurized</em> to kill germs.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tags: artificial colors , artificial sweeteners , high fructose corn syrup , hydrogenated oils , hydrolyzed soy protein , milk , pork , raw milk , shellfish , soft drinks , white flour , white sugar\nJordan Rubin , author of\u00a0 \u201cPerfect Weight America\u201d lists the \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d food items that we all should avoid for better health.

The individual countries are free to add certain requirements, such as special sanitary regulations, and frequent quality tests (at least once a month) are mandatory. \u00a0In particular, France sets very high standards for raw milk and especially raw milk cheeses.\u00a0 Many traditional French cheeses have solely been made from raw milk for hundreds of years.\u00a0 In Germany, raw milk is commonly called Vorzugsmilch. \u00a0\u00a0Raw milk, and raw milk cheeses, are legally sold throughout the entire country and are favorites of the health food and slow food movements.\nIn many parts of Asia, milk is sold raw but is boiled in the home prior to being consumed. In Scotland, distribution of raw milk is illegal.\u00a0 In England, sales of raw milk products are heavily regulated.\u00a0 Only 200 producers have the required licenses and they must sell their products directly to consumers.\u00a0 The milk must have a warning label which reads, \u201cThis product has not been heat-treated and may contain organisms harmful to health\u201d.\u00a0 The sale of raw milk for drinking purposes is illegal in all states and territories in Australia.\u00a0 This has been circumvented somewhat by selling raw milk as bath milk.\u00a0 The sale of raw milk directly to consumers is prohibited in Canada.\nRaw milk advocates claim that the unpasteurized stuff contains natural enzymes and beneficial bacteria that are removed during the pasteurization process.\u00a0 They also often claim that it just tastes better.\u00a0 A website by the name of Raw Milk Truth offers these anecdotes:\nA lovely lady and her family stopped by on their way passing through town. She had been drinking raw milk for years and her chronic arthritis had disappeared. However, on her recent 3-month vacation she had not been able to find any farms nearby where she could buy raw milk. During that time her arthritis came back full force. She related this story to me when she stopped by our farm to pick up some raw milk on her way back home.\nAnother case in point is a woman who had been trying to get pregnant for years and was having no luck. She became pregnant 6 months after beginning to drink raw milk.\nPlease feel free to judge the merits of these statements for yourselves without further comment from me.\nOn the other side of the coin, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers the following cautionary tale of a child made seriously ill by raw milk.\nMary McGonigle-Martin, from California, is the kind of mom who does her homework. Searching for a healthier way to provide dairy for her 7-year-old son, she considered raw milk. \u00a0A little research convinced here that a particular brand of raw milk, which was tested by the farmer, was deemed safe, so she bought some for her son.\nMary believes she was lulled into a false sense of security by the farmer.\u00a0 She says, \u201cIn my mind, if the milk was tested and they\u2019ve never found a pathogen and he\u2019d been in business for 4 years and they\u2019d tested it, then how could it possibly have a pathogen?\u201d\u00a0 For two weeks she brought home a quart each week to see if her son would like it, it was the third batch, she says, that was contaminated with E. coli.\nAfter drinking the contaminated milk, her son became ill and then his condition quickly deteriorated.\u00a0 Her son was diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS \u2013 a complication caused by an E. coli infection.\u00a0 Mary went from being the mother of a child with diarrhea and vomiting, to the mother of a child who was in kidney failure and needed dialysis.\u00a0 Over the next three months healthcare professionals worked hard to save his life.\u00a0 He had congestive heart failure and later had to be placed on a ventilator.\u00a0 Fortunately, Mary\u2019s son pulled through and was eventually discharged from the hospital.\nAfter watching her son struggle for his life, Mary began to truly understand the risks of drinking raw milk.\u00a0 Mary says, \u201cThe risk from drinking raw milk isn\u2019t a tummy ache for a few days or diarrhea and vomiting that goes away.\u00a0 The risk is that the pathogen could kill you\u201d.\nMary chose to buy raw milk because she had read about its benefits.\u00a0 After reflecting on her raw milk research, Mary believes that the risks weren\u2019t communicated.\u00a0 She says that she didn\u2019t not think of the risks at the time she was buying the milk because all of the information she read just covered the positives.\u00a0 In her mind, she says, \u201cWhen they tested the milk I felt that covered it.\u201d\u00a0 She continues, \u201cRaw milk is safe if there\u2019s not a pathogen, but the chance of it having a pathogen, the risk is so huge, it doesn\u2019t outweigh the benefits of making that choice for your family\u201d.\u00a0 Of course that is just her opinion.\nOne of the health claims of raw milk is that it contains more enzymes and nutrients than pasteurized milk.\u00a0 This is true.\u00a0 The process that makes the milk safer to drink also inactivates certain enzymes and nutrients.\u00a0 Before I go on, I\u2019d like to note that enzymes in milk do not make a major contribution to the digestion of milk in humans.\u00a0 That is accomplished by enzymes in the stomach and small intestine.\nLipases are enzymes that degrade fats.\u00a0 The major lipase in milk is lipoprotein lipase.\u00a0 Pasteurization will inactivate the lipase in milk and increase its shelf life.\u00a0 Proteases are enzymes that degrade proteins.\u00a0 Certain proteases are inactivated by heat and others are not.\u00a0 Protein degradation may be undesirable in that it may result in bitter or off flavors in the milk.\u00a0 Lactoperoxidase is one of the most heat stable enzymes found in milk.\u00a0 It has been suggested that the presence of lactoperoxidase in raw milk inhibits pathogen growth.\u00a0 However, since lactoperoxidase only has antimicrobial properties when combined with hydrogen peroxide and thiocyanate, these chemicals would have to be added to milk to show any of that type of benefit.\nSome nutrients, such as vitamins B and C, are somewhat destroyed by the pasteurization process.\u00a0 However, a typical healthy diet contains more than enough of these nutrients to make up the difference.\u00a0 Vitamins D, K and E are not altered by pasteurization.\nBy this point some of you are probably asking, \u201cWhat about homogenization?\u00a0 Is raw milk homogenized?\u00a0 Is that good or bad?\u201d\nTo understand homogenization, first you need to understand a little about milk itself.\u00a0 Milk is an oil-in-water emulsion, with the fat globules dispersed throughout.\u00a0 If raw milk were left to stand, the fat would rise and form a cream layer.\u00a0 Homogenization is a mechanical treatment of the fat globules in milk brought about by passing milk under high pressure through a tiny orifice, which results in a decrease in the average diameter and an increase in number and surface area, of the fat globules.\u00a0 This results in a much reduced tendency for the remaining fat globules to form cream.\nThose opposed to homogenization argue that decreasing the size of fat globules may have unhealthy effects, including allowing steroid and protein hormones to bypass normal digestion and increase their levels in the body. Concerns that uptake of the protein xanthine oxidase is increased by homogenization, leading to atherosclerosis, were first raised in the 1970s.\nSubsequent research \u201cfailed to substantiate, and in many cases has refuted a plausible effect of xanthine oxidase from homogenized milk on cardiovascular disease.\u201d\u00a0 Furthermore, scientific studies do not currently support claims that milk homogenization affects the development of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, milk allergy and milk intolerance, Type I diabetes or Type II diabetes.\nSo, what have we learned?\u00a0 There is no doubt that drinking pasteurized milk is healthful for most people.\u00a0 It is full of calcium, vitamin D, phosphorous and a balance of other nutrients that have been proven to build your bones and teeth as well as promote the healthy function of your muscles and blood vessels.\u00a0 There is also no doubt that it is very possible for raw milk to be contaminated with pathogens that can make you very ill. You can\u2019t look at, smell, or taste a bottle of raw milk and tell if it\u2019s safe to drink.\u00a0 Please consider these facts before you play Russian roulette with your health.\nSources:\n"}, {"score": 284.83362, "uuid": "8f8d12d0-935d-53d6-9fae-9fb65bc878f9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1913wb-55-24790", "target_hostname": "www.theinconvenienttruth.org", "target_uri": "http://www.theinconvenienttruth.org/podcast/the-raw-truth-about-raw-milk/", "page_rank": 1.6569752e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "The Raw Truth about Raw Milk &laquo; The Inconvenient Truth", "snippet": "Raw milk advocates claim that the <em>unpasteurized</em> stuff contains natural enzymes and beneficial bacteria that are removed during the pasteurization process.

However, on her recent 3-month vacation she had not been able to find any farms nearby where she could buy raw milk. During that time her arthritis came back full force. She related this story to me when she stopped by our farm to pick up some raw milk on her way back home.\nAnother case in point is a woman who had been trying to get pregnant for years and was having no luck. She became pregnant 6 months after beginning to drink raw milk.\nPlease feel free to judge the merits of these statements for yourselves without further comment from me.\nOn the other side of the coin, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers the following cautionary tale of a child made seriously ill by raw milk.\nMary McGonigle-Martin, from California, is the kind of mom who does her homework. Searching for a healthier way to provide dairy for her 7-year-old son, she considered raw milk. \u00a0A little research convinced here that a particular brand of raw milk, which was tested by the farmer, was deemed safe, so she bought some for her son.\nMary believes she was lulled into a false sense of security by the farmer.\u00a0 She says, \u201cIn my mind, if the milk was tested and they\u2019ve never found a pathogen and he\u2019d been in business for 4 years and they\u2019d tested it, then how could it possibly have a pathogen?\u201d\u00a0 For two weeks she brought home a quart each week to see if her son would like it, it was the third batch, she says, that was contaminated with E. coli.\nAfter drinking the contaminated milk, her son became ill and then his condition quickly deteriorated.\u00a0 Her son was diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS \u2013 a complication caused by an E. coli infection.\u00a0 Mary went from being the mother of a child with diarrhea and vomiting, to the mother of a child who was in kidney failure and needed dialysis.\u00a0 Over the next three months healthcare professionals worked hard to save his life.\u00a0 He had congestive heart failure and later had to be placed on a ventilator.\u00a0 Fortunately, Mary\u2019s son pulled through and was eventually discharged from the hospital.\nAfter watching her son struggle for his life, Mary began to truly understand the risks of drinking raw milk.\u00a0 Mary says, \u201cThe risk from drinking raw milk isn\u2019t a tummy ache for a few days or diarrhea and vomiting that goes away.\u00a0 The risk is that the pathogen could kill you\u201d.\nMary chose to buy raw milk because she had read about its benefits.\u00a0 After reflecting on her raw milk research, Mary believes that the risks weren\u2019t communicated.\u00a0 She says that she didn\u2019t not think of the risks at the time she was buying the milk because all of the information she read just covered the positives.\u00a0 In her mind, she says, \u201cWhen they tested the milk I felt that covered it.\u201d\u00a0 She continues, \u201cRaw milk is safe if there\u2019s not a pathogen, but the chance of it having a pathogen, the risk is so huge, it doesn\u2019t outweigh the benefits of making that choice for your family\u201d.\u00a0 Of course that is just her opinion.\nOne of the health claims of raw milk is that it contains more enzymes and nutrients than pasteurized milk.\u00a0 This is true.\u00a0 The process that makes the milk safer to drink also inactivates certain enzymes and nutrients.\u00a0 Before I go on, I\u2019d like to note that enzymes in milk do not make a major contribution to the digestion of milk in humans.\u00a0 That is accomplished by enzymes in the stomach and small intestine.\nLipases are enzymes that degrade fats.\u00a0 The major lipase in milk is lipoprotein lipase.\u00a0 Pasteurization will inactivate the lipase in milk and increase its shelf life.\u00a0 Proteases are enzymes that degrade proteins.\u00a0 Certain proteases are inactivated by heat and others are not.\u00a0 Protein degradation may be undesirable in that it may result in bitter or off flavors in the milk.\u00a0 Lactoperoxidase is one of the most heat stable enzymes found in milk.\u00a0 It has been suggested that the presence of lactoperoxidase in raw milk inhibits pathogen growth.\u00a0 However, since lactoperoxidase only has antimicrobial properties when combined with hydrogen peroxide and thiocyanate, these chemicals would have to be added to milk to show any of that type of benefit.\nSome nutrients, such as vitamins B and C, are somewhat destroyed by the pasteurization process.\u00a0 However, a typical healthy diet contains more than enough of these nutrients to make up the difference.\u00a0 Vitamins D, K and E are not altered by pasteurization.\nBy this point some of you are probably asking, \u201cWhat about homogenization?\u00a0 Is raw milk homogenized?\u00a0 Is that good or bad?\u201d\nTo understand homogenization, first you need to understand a little about milk itself.\u00a0 Milk is an oil-in-water emulsion, with the fat globules dispersed throughout.\u00a0 If raw milk were left to stand, the fat would rise and form a cream layer.\u00a0 Homogenization is a mechanical treatment of the fat globules in milk brought about by passing milk under high pressure through a tiny orifice, which results in a decrease in the average diameter and an increase in number and surface area, of the fat globules.\u00a0 This results in a much reduced tendency for the remaining fat globules to form cream.\nThose opposed to homogenization argue that decreasing the size of fat globules may have unhealthy effects, including allowing steroid and protein hormones to bypass normal digestion and increase their levels in the body. Concerns that uptake of the protein xanthine oxidase is increased by homogenization, leading to atherosclerosis, were first raised in the 1970s.\nSubsequent research \u201cfailed to substantiate, and in many cases has refuted a plausible effect of xanthine oxidase from homogenized milk on cardiovascular disease.\u201d\u00a0 Furthermore, scientific studies do not currently support claims that milk homogenization affects the development of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, milk allergy and milk intolerance, Type I diabetes or Type II diabetes.\nSo, what have we learned?\u00a0 There is no doubt that drinking pasteurized milk is healthful for most people.\u00a0 It is full of calcium, vitamin D, phosphorous and a balance of other nutrients that have been proven to build your bones and teeth as well as promote the healthy function of your muscles and blood vessels.\u00a0 There is also no doubt that it is very possible for raw milk to be contaminated with pathogens that can make you very ill. You can\u2019t look at, smell, or taste a bottle of raw milk and tell if it\u2019s safe to drink.\u00a0 Please consider these facts before you play Russian roulette with your health.\nSources:\n"}, {"score": 289.0311, "uuid": "d1abea2b-9d35-595b-8be4-af658e86563c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0205wb-43-21412", "target_hostname": "www.mouseplanet.com", "target_uri": "http://www.mouseplanet.com/guide/658/Disneyland-Resort/Grand-Californian-Hotel/Napa-Rose", "page_rank": 1.2143863e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "MousePlanet Park Guide - Disneyland Resort - Napa Rose", "snippet": "A relative of Dutch Edam, made from <em>pasteurized</em> Cow&#x27;s milk, Mimolette has a vivid orange color and a distinctive nutty <em>taste</em>.

For my wife's birthday and our 29th wedding anniversary, I decided that we should spend a few days at Disneyland. In planning this event, I decided to pull out the stops and I decided that we would do something awesome, so I reserved seats at the \"Chef's Counter at Napa Rose on her birthday.\nWhen we arrived, we waited only a few minutes and were then taken to our seats. The Chef's counter is exactly as the term implies. We actually sat at the counter looking into the kitchen and watched all of the very capable chefs as they prepared dishes for their guests. Shortly after we were seated, we were asked what type of wine we preferred and the wine steward kept our glasses filled with our favorite, White Zinfandel from Woodbridge wineries. We were then introduced to Executive Chef Andrew Sutton who asked us about food allergies and preferences. I'm not a big fan of fish and that's important but I'm getting ahead of myself.\nMy wife loves to cook and bake, so Chef Sutton and her were having a grand time talking about stuff that was over my head. I'm not stupid and if you talk to me about firearms, scuba diving, ham radio, or the space program, I can stay with you. But they lost me after chef Sutton asked me what I like. During their conversation, I'm sure she mentioned her likes and dislikes, but they lost me when they were talking about...well...whatever it was they were talking about.\nAs we watched the activity in the kitchen, a food server brought our first dish. She said it was complementary and from Chef Sutton as she placed Oysters Rockefeller on the half shell in front of us. I looked at my wife, and she looked at me and then I picked it up and poured the oyster in my mouth. What I tasted was to say the least, a surprise. There was a pleasant taste of garlic and I actually enjoyed something I never tried before. As the dinner progressed, Chef Sutton threw another curve ball at me and the server placed \"John Dory\", another fish dish, in front of me. I was intrigued with this new experience with food and tried the John Dory, and to my surprise, actually enjoyed it. The other dishes were wild boar and lamb, something my wife tells me was a Portobello mushroom Cappuccino Bisque (I had to look it up in her Disney cookbook so I could spell it), and other non fish dishes.\nTo make a long story short, Napa Rose was the best eating experience I ever had. This is coming from a guy that lives on burgers and fries from In-N-Out and McDonald's.\nAs a final note, it wasn't cheap. We had a great time, the food was awesome, and everyone at Napa Rose was great. The total bill was about $250.00. But we were full and satisfied and we felt that the whole experience was well worth it.\n3 out of 3 people found this review helpful\nWas it helpful to you?\nSaturday, October 13, 2007 at roughly 8:00 PM\nReviewer: Andrew (andrew@mouseplanet.com) Palo Alto, CA \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 November\u00a014,\u00a02007\nNote: This review is for the Napa Rose Lounge.\nGuests: A whole lot of MousePlanet staff and/or crew people\nWhat I had: Diligently Selected Cheeses.\nThis review will be in a different style than usual. Rather than going over the appetizers, small bites and drinks that everyone in our party of nine enjoyed, I'm going to focus solely on my cheese platter. Trust me, everyone else liked what they had.\nThe \"Diligently Selected Cheeses\" were served on a platter with various bits of dried fruit and candied nuts, and came with a printed handout naming and describing each cheese in detail. Here they are in order: (typos and odd phrasing are straight from the handout!)\n* Brie Val De Sa\u00f4ne (vol dee Sone) - France\nThis is a rare and hard to get brie cheese, from Vale de Sa\u00f4ne near the river Sa\u00f4ne. This particular brie has a long history dating back to Charlemagne in 774. Many Bries are around 40% - 45% butter fat, this is over 60% and perfectly ripe. The cream-colored soft interior oozes at room temperature. The flavor is sweet and buttery with hints of almond.\n* Bucheron, St. Saviol (boo-share-OH) - France\nThis Goat's milk cheese is from Burgundy, France, made in the village of Poitou. This is a fresh, unripened ch\u00e8vre. This cheese is a pleasant cheese to snack on, which is somewhat tart and chalky on the palette.\n* Etorki (eh-tor-KEE) - Aquitaine, France\nThis is an Aged A.O.C. 100% Sheep's Milk cheese from the high mountains of the Western Pyrenees of France. This is a true world class cheese with a nutty almost fruity character. The cheese has remained unchanged for well over a hundred years due to the remoteness of the area.\n*Mimolette (MEE-moh-LETT) - France\nA relative of Dutch Edam, made from pasteurized Cow's milk, Mimolette has a vivid orange color and a distinctive nutty taste. It is aged over 1 year and has a firm, yet flaky texture.\n* Grana Padano - Emilia-Romagna, Italy\nThis Cow's milk D.O.C. cheese is made througout Lombardy andPiedmont regions of Northern Italy. The name padona means \"of the Po River\". This cheese is aged over two years and is a Parmesan style. The color is a straw to cream color. The flavor is that of classic Parmigiano-Reggiano, but with wonderful nutty notes and less salty flavor than other parmesans.\n* San Joaquin Gold - California, USA\nThis is an artisan cheese made from unpasteurized cow's milk by Fiscalini Family Creamery in Modesto, California. Its milk comes from it sown herd of 1500 Holstein cows. It just recently won a gold medal at the prestigious London World Cheese Awards. Aged for 15 months, it is semi-hard, with a natural rind and sweet, salty, buttery taste and a rich, nutty flavor and pleasingly crumbly texture.\n* Roquefort \"Le Papillon\" (roke-FORE) (LAY PAPP-ee-yone) - France\n\"Le Papillon\": the butterfly. The worlds premiere sheep's milk blue-veined cheese. It has a creamy interior with an intense, complex and spicy flavor with hints of bitterness associated with rye bread crumbs, which as used to distribute the bleu veining.\n* Shropshire Blue (SHROP-shur-blu) - England\nThis cheese was invented in England at the beginning of the centure and currently regarded as a world class cheese. Shropshire is a farmhouse Blue-Vein Cheddar made from Cow's Milk. It has a crumbly, yet firm and creamy texture. This cheese is aged 1 year, and is great with red wine!\nWithout exception, each one of the cheeses was wonderful. Each cheese's associated paragraph pretty accurately described the flavor and texture, and I made sure to try most of them along with the bits of fruit, candied nuts and toast points. Pure pleasure, completely decadent. I loved it.\nService: Disappointing to start--the server saw a large party and must have assumed we were going to hang out, not order much and therefore tip low--but she perked up once we started ordering drinks and food. The odd thing was that she offered opinions on just about everything ordered. Actually that's not the odd thing--the odd thing was that her opinions were fairly negative and she was somewhat insistent about her preferred alternative. Again, though, she did get a lot better after the initial round of orders. One other sour note was that it was basically impossible to get a glass of water, and once having received one to have it refilled.\nWould we go back: Yes, but perhaps in a smaller group.\n5 out of 6 people found this review helpful\nWas it helpful to you?\nSunday, October 28, 2007\nReviewer: renodlandlover Reno, NV \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 October\u00a031,\u00a02007\nWe had PS for Napa Rose to celebrate our thirteenth anniversary at 7:30, dinner time.\nMy husband and I were very excited to have a wonderful dinner at Napa Rose, especially after a few questions and responses on the boards here. We were somewhat disappointed. First, let me say that primarily that disappointment stemmed from the fact that my husband is a relatively strict vegetarian - not a vegan, but does not eat any meat - fish or fowl included. He is willing to eat some meat based broths, and thank goodness for that or he would have just had wine for dinner.\nOur server was Heather. She was very thoughtful and attentive. We arrived and were seated right away, and served the bread basket, which has WONDERFUL breads, especially the parmesean \"bread\". It was terrific! We knew the restaraunt was going to be quite expensive, and it measures up to that reputation. After perusing the menu for several minutes, it became clear that there was not ONE main dish on the menu that did not include meat. There is the portabella mushroom soup, but it is made with rabbit broth. We had that anyway, it is amazing.\nHeather offered Ron some \"pasta\" or a \"vegetable tower\", but those of you that are veggies understand that pasta or a pile of veggies, no matter how wonderfully prepared, is not a meal. Especially when it would be $20+ for that. We asked about the risotto on the appetizer menu - also made with meat stock. She then said she would enquire about some options - Ron asked about a serving of the pumpkin ravioli. The chef was willing to serve that as a separate entree (it was part of the Vintner's dinner). She did make it clear that even the ravioli dish would not be totally meat free.\nI am a vegetarian by marriage, so I ordered the ginger shrimp. It was very tasty, and RICH!. We did order the flourless chocolate cake for dessert, which was wonderful.\nHeather was a wonderful server, and all of the servers there are sommeliers. She chose a wine for us, once we told her what we generally like, and it was quite nice.\nSo, to sum up:\nService - very attentive and good\nPrice - very high, as expected\nFood - very rich, good, except for vegetarian options, which were just about nil\nAtmosphere - lovely\nI think Ron, my DH, summed it best like this: At a restaraunt where there is clearly amazing talent and ability of the chef and cooking staff, it would be nice if that talent was used to create ONE dish that is meat free, and tasty, and balanced, and wonderful like everything else on the menu looks to be. While Heather said again and again that they try to be accomodating, they actually are not to those that do not eat meat.\nWe did enjoy a dinner out on our own, but most likely will not go back, due to the lack of vegetarian friendly food.\n9 out of 12 people found this review helpful\nWas it helpful to you?\nHistory and Trivia - Hide Section\nThe restaurant has earned a number of awards since opening in 2001. Most recently, Executive Chef Andrew Sutton was honored with the 2009 Antonin Car\u00eame Medal, and two of the restaurant's sous chefs were named \"Sous Chef of the Year\" at the 2008-2009 Southern California Restaurant Writers awards.\nThe Disneyland Web site also lists the following awards.\nNumber one food ranking in the Zagat Survey for Orange County restaurants in 2002, 2003 and 2004\nZagat's Orange County \"Most Popular Restaurant\" in 2008 and 2009\nOrange County Business Journal's \"Best Southern California Restaurant 2007\"\nWine Spectator's \"Best of Award of Excellence\"\nDistinguished Restaurants of North America (DiRoNA) award of excellence for the second time in 2007\nThe restaurant's reputation as a wine destination is due both to the expansive wine cellar and the efforts of its first general manager, Michael A. Jordan. Jordan opened the restaurant with chef Sutton in 2001, and was responsible for a Resort-wide (and later company-wide) initiative to create a comprehensive wine education program for restaurant servers. Jordan was honored as a Master Sommelier in 2007, and under his guidance the large numbers of Disneyland Resort cast members became certified sommeliers.\nAlong with his Disneyland Resort duties, Jordan was the Global Manager of Wine and Sales Standards and wine educator for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, working with every Disney resort to develop their own wine eduction programs and helping to guide the wine lists at their top restaurants. A frequent visitor to the Disney Cruise Line, Jordan hosted wine education classes for crew and passengers alike. Jordan was also considered one of the driving forces behind Disney's California Food & Wine Festival. By the time Jordan left Disney in 2009, Napa Rose boasted 47 sommeliers, including 5 Advanced Level sommeliers, both believed to be more than any other restaurant in the world.\nJordan's sudden resignation in Spetember 2009 came as a surprise to many. In interviews, Jordan said that he was leaving to persue a dream of opening his own wine label, Word Vineyards. (He has since returned to restaurant life as the president of the Beachcomber, a pair of ocean-view restaurants in Southern California). Jordan's assistant manager, advanced sommelier Joy Cushing, quietly stepped into the general manager role while a new general manager was sought. In February 2010, Disney announced that Philippe Tosques, formerly of the Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, had been hired as general manager for Napa Rose. Cushing remains as the restaurant's head sommelier.\nLinks of Interest - Hide Section\nMousePlanet Links of Interest\nDisney Parks Blog - And the Winner Is...

That\u2019s why the Uzbeki immigrant sells raw milk from a farm in Tallahassee at Camilla, the small Eastern European grocery store off U.S. 41 in Naples that he and his wife have been running for the past year and a half. His operation is small, selling only about 20 gallons of milk and about 10 quarts of cream each week. He also makes and sells, butter, cream cheese, farmer\u2019s cheese and keffir made from the milk.\n\u201cWhere I am from, there is no raw milk,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is only milk. That\u2019s the only way you have it.\u201d\nBut the U.S.D.A., the F.D.A., the C.D.C. and just about every other acronymed health agency in the United States thinks raw milk, or milk that hasn\u2019t been pasteurized, could make you seriously ill and, in the wrong circumstances, possibly kill you.\nForget Michael Bloomberg versus salt and the City of Chicago versus foie gras; the most heated debate in food these days is whether or not raw milk is a superfood or a cesspool of bacteria. As more people take notice of not only what they are eating but also where it comes from and how it\u2019s handled, the movement for raw milk, cheese, butter and eggs is growing.\nSo what is raw milk? Is it a miracle elixir or organic poison? The answer you get depends on who you talk to.\n---\n\u201cRaw milk is inherently dangerous and should not be consumed by anyone, at any time, for any reason,\u201d John Sheehan, director of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s division of plant and dairy food safety told the Wall Street Journal in March. This was after 12 incidents of people being reported ill the Midwest after drinking raw milk contaminated with a dangerous bacterium called campylobacter, which can cause dysentery.\nOn the other side are people like Frank Oakes, who says his grandfather taught him a valuable lesson as a kid about the benefits of raw milk.\n\u201cHe showed me that a calf will die within 10 days drinking milk from its mother that has been pasteurized,\u201d he said. \u201cPasteurized milk cannot sustain life.\u201d\nRaw milk proponents say that the process of pasteurization, which heats milk to a temperature which kills harmful bacteria, is also killing off many of the nutrients, vitamins and enzymes that make milk healthy.\nIt\u2019s a battle happening around the country. State legislatures are looking into the issue. Wisconsin state legislature is debating amending state laws to allow the sale of raw milk at the same time that Whole Foods is pulling the product from its stores.\nFood safety experts say that pasteurization saves lives. The Center for Science in the Public Interest says food-borne illnesses are on the rise as consumption of raw milk and products made from it grows. Sarah Klein, an attorney for the Washington, D.C.-based food and nutrition think tank, says that pasteurization has led the percentage of food-borne illnesses from milk products dropping from 25 percent total complaints before the technique was widely adopted in the early 1900s to about 1 percent now.\nAlthough everyone is vulnerable to illness from E. Coli or Salmonella poisoning, children, elderly and people with weekend immune systems are most at risk from drinking raw milk, Klein says.\nIn March, the FDA confirmed 12 illnesses in Michigan related to raw milk. Between 1998 and 2007, there were about 300 outbreaks with about 5,000 people sickened by dairy products, according to Center for Science in the Public Interest research. Only 34 percent of those were related to raw dairy, but 80 percent of milk-specific outbreaks were related to raw milk. The FDA links two deaths, 187 hospitalizations and 1,614 illnesses to raw milk between 1998 and 2008. Research by the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development center found an average of 5 out breaks a year related to raw milk between 1993 and 2006, which was double the number from the previous 20 years.\nKlein says the numbers are somewhat misleading because of the relatively small number of people drinking raw milk. When you compare the number of illnesses to eating ground beef (100 million pounds of ground beef was recalled just in 2009) or even salad greens (which caused more than 7,000 illnesses between \u201997 and \u201908), it doesn\u2019t add up because raw milk doesn\u2019t do that much volume.\n\u201cBut that number is growing as raw milk gains in popularity,\u201d Klein says. \u201cPeople are taking a really big risk.\u201d\nDon Splain, a local private chef and raw milk advocate, says the reason for the high percentage of milk-related illnesses was the rise in industrial dairy production.\n\u201cMost of the laws about pasteurization came about when milk production started moving into unsanitary condition,\u201d he says.\nSplain started a Web site, keepmilkraw.com, touting the safety of raw milk, when purchased from responsible farmers. He says the ideal milk cows eat a diet almost entirely of grass and aren\u2019t milked in highly industrialized settings.\nSplain and other raw milk advocates say finding a responsible farm owner or a merchant who regularly visits the farms is crucial to raw milk consumption. Obidov says it\u2019s in the farm\u2019s best interest to supply safe milk because one outbreak will ruin the business.\n\u201cIf someone gets sick, then no one will buy from that farm,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s in their best interest to make sure everything is safe.\u201d\nKlein says it doesn\u2019t matter what the setting is or how clean the operation is; the biology of a cow makes it nearly impossible to keep fecal matter out of milk.\n\u201cGeographically speaking, the area where the manure is isn\u2019t that far from the utters where the milk comes from,\u201d she says.\n---\nAt his organic grocery store, Food and Thought in the Gateway Plaza off U.S. 41, Oakes has a whole cooler dedicated to raw milk, which he said is a \u201creally important part of our business\u201d both monetarily and philosophically.\nThe milk, of which Oakes estimates he sells between 200 and 300 gallons a week, rests in glistening glass half-gallon jugs with a big label right in the middle of them declaring them for pet consumption only. The bottles are labeled at the dairies in Pennsylvania from which Oakes buys the milk. Otherwise he couldn\u2019t bring it across state lines.\nSince 1987, federal laws have prohibited the interstate sale of raw milk for human consumption. And Florida laws require the label on any raw milk sold in the state and on farm fresh eggs sold to consumers by farms that don\u2019t have a license to process them.\nIn some ways Florida\u2019s law is more permissive than other states. Some states require raw milk to be dyed red or to have small amounts of other substances added to make it unappealing to humans. The labels are built to protect farmers and to provide a disincentive for consumers, but Oakes and Obidov say it\u2019s nothing that a little education can\u2019t fix.\nPrice might actually be a bigger roadblock for those thinking of buying raw milk. Because the market is relatively small, the costs for raw milk are high. Camilla sells gallons of whole milk for $10 and skim for $7. Cream is $10 a quart, butter $10 a pound. Oakes sells half gallons of cows milk for $5.99.\nMarta Suarez a 29-year-old Naples mother, says she switched from organic pasteurized milk to raw milk because she was worried about what she losing.\n\u201cIs it killing what is valuable?\u201d she asks. \u201cI can taste a big difference.\u201d\nThat taste, Obidov says is the bacteria your body needs.\nObidov might as well be the spokesmodel for the raw milk movement. The 30-year-old is a picture of health. His biceps bulge from his tight T-shirt. His smile is pearly white. Only a bit of premature balding, which he hides by shaving his head, keeps him from looking like a cover model for a fitness magazine.\nHe credits this all to raw milk. He consumes gallons of it a week, just like he did as a kid growing up in Uzbekistan.\nWhen he moved to the United States in 1999, Obidov continued drinking milk just as he\u2019d done before. The only difference, he started feeling ill. He was eventually diagnosed as lactose-intolerant. He didn\u2019t understand why this happened.\n\u201cMy mother couldn\u2019t breast feed me when I was a baby, so I was literally raised on raw cow\u2019s milk,\u201d he says. \u201cBut after five years here, I had health problems.\u201d\nBy 2004 he stopped drinking milk altogether. And he didn\u2019t have any again until a few years later when he saw raw milk at Whole Foods.\n\u201cI tried it and I was fine,\u201d he says.\nNow he spends a good part of his week making products from the raw milk he brings in from a farm in near Tallahassee. From week to week he says you can see the difference. Depending on what the cows are eating that week, the butter he makes from the milk could be a golden yellow or nearly white.\nHe offers anyone who comes in his store a sample of the products in hopes of making another convert. If people claim lactose intolerance, he tells them to try anyway. If they feel bad, he\u2019ll take them to the doctor and pay the bill.\n\u201cMilk is the most complex food on earth,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has minerals, vitamins, acids, 250-plus components. They are natural. Why would we want to kill them off?\u201d\nConnect with Jonathan Foerster at www.naplesnews.com/staff/jonathan_foerster\n"}, {"score": 280.28027, "uuid": "92272db7-455c-5e53-ba29-0b64a702a979", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-64-24204", "target_hostname": "blogs.babycenter.com", "target_uri": "http://blogs.babycenter.com/mom_stories/04042012hazards-of-raw-milk/", "page_rank": 1.2483652e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Hazards of raw milk | BabyCenter", "snippet": "<em>Pasteurized</em> milk has next to zero health benefits and <em>does</em> more harm to your body <em>than</em> it <em>does</em> good.

They actually arent allowed to sell it, but they would get around it by people buying \u201cshares\u201d of the cows.\nMaybe if I could milk my own cow I would feel differently. But I don\u2019t trust someone else to produce my food in sanitary conditions without oversight.\njen\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 6:14 am\nIt\u2019s important to understand where your milk is coming from and what processes are in place to prevent/limit contamination. Raw milk can be safe, if it\u2019s obtained in a responsible manner. Raw milk can be unsafe if it\u2019s obtained in an irresponsible manner. Think, preparing your food with clean utensils and freshly washed hands. Versus preparing your food with crusty dirty utensils and hands that just spread fertilizer in your garden.\nIf you want to drink raw milk, get it local. Where you can see the operation and get to know the farmers. For those of you who don\u2019t have that option, think about how much of your family\u2019s safety you\u2019re willing to trust to strangers states and states away.\nCharlotte\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 9:42 am\nIt\u2019s all about where you get it! People with their own cows, or who get raw milk from a trusted neighbor or family member with a cow, know where it\u2019s coming from and that cows are being well cared for. But I\u2019d never get milk raw from a huge dairy, no matter what precautions they take \u2014 it\u2019s not worth the risk when there are tons of cows and a sick one may not be noticed!\nAnd, as someone else said, when will the dangers of pasteurization be all over the news?! It rots your teeth and lowers your immune system \u2014 check out Ramiel Nagel\u2019s book Cure Tooth Decay or Sally Fallon\u2019s Nourishing Traditions.\nVal\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 9:49 am\nOne other thing that I worry about with the anecdotal evidence is that everyone\u2019s gut has a different \u201cflora\u201d make up or whatever. If you grew up on a farm drinking raw milk, you probably had the stomach bacteria to digest it safely. If I grew up in the city drinking regular old super processed milk, I may not have the bacteria needed and the same milk, gathered in the exact same way, may make me sick. Not to mention the degree to which stomach flora varies between regions, ethnic groups, even families.\nMaybe I am oversimplifying, but could it not be like water in foreign countries? Someone who lives in Mexico can safely drink the water, but a tourist can\u2019t. I wonder if something similar could be a factor in this.\nLisa Canfield\nApril 5, 2012 at 12:09 pm\n\u2018Young children\u2026 are at high(er) risk from becoming ill from drinking raw milk.\u2019\nI am sixteen years old and have a processed(pasteurized) milk allergy since I was five.

It must profiting to certain someone. It\u2019s completely illogical. Cows have been producing milk since the beginning of time and now we claim that raw milk is dangerous. I\u2019m assuming that what\u2019s dangerous is the conditions these poor cows live in. I\u2019ve recently driven past few feed lots in TX and the smell was disgusting, not like farm smell. We are indeed losing common sense.\nDrCherry\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 12:16 pm\nI\u2019ve been drinking raw milk for years and will never again drink the sterilized swill milk that is now laced with oxidized cholesterol.\nPasteurization allows large feed-lot producers to feed their stock garbage.

No one is forcing anyone to drink it, and no one is suggesting selling raw with a pasteurized label. So what\u2019s the problem?\nMegan Harris\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 12:22 pm\nI am shocked at what people come up with. I buy raw milk from a Grade A Certified Dairy and have never had any problems. What\u2019s dangerous is pasteurized milk! When milk is pasteurized all of the good and bad bacteria is killed. Many more people get sick from pasteurized milk than from raw milk.\nAndrea\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 12:23 pm\nRaw milk is not dangerous per say. It is all about the the way the farm is kept and how well the cattle is treated. I would love for you to go to a factory farm and see how the animals are treated. The cattle are standing knee deep in feces and eating a poor diet. You never here anyone from the FDA or the CDC talking about the filthy conditions of a factory farm. They would never tell you to stop eating spinich, beef, etc. The reason for pasturization is because of the conditions of overcrowding etc. I will NEVER drink milk from the super market. It is proven that raw milk is more nutritious than pastuerized milk. There have be less outbreaks of illness than conventional food. If you are worried about drinking raw milk, than I suggest you worry about eating from our food supply. So next time you pick up that cantelope or eat some spinich or ground beef,lettuce think about whether it is going to be contaminated with bacteria. How many people died from the cantelope outbreak last year? I think there were at least 45, but that does not stop people from eating cantelope. If raw milk become legal in more states that just gives competition to the factory farmers and would require them to clean up their acts! If you are going to drink raw milk, know your farmer, know the cattle, and check their farm operations out. A small dairy farmer selling raw milk has way more to loose than a factory farm.\nMark\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 12:27 pm\nIf we allow raw milk to be sold then there can\u2019t be large amounts of blood, puss and feces in it, like there is in grocery store pasteurized milk.

Getting sick from drinking raw milk is rare. Do your research thorougly please, and from unbiased sources. Obviously, you want to be sure your milk comes from a clean source. We visit the farm where we get our raw milk from regularly. The benefits of raw milk are off the charts!

I don\u2019t see too many articles from well meaning doctors talking about how many people have become sick from eating tomatoes, beef, and chicken. In 2008, 1500 people got sick eating tomatoes and jalapenos, almost 600 people got sick from watermelon that same year, and we should also mention the 1600 prisoners that got sick from PASTEURIZED milk in 2006. Where are these stories, and why are we scaring the pants off people who eat these foods?

Do you know how sanitary that meat is your eating from your grocery store??? I guess you think because it\u2019s wrapped in plastic, it\u2019s clean. Not to mention the pink slime. Do you know how many bug pieces and mouse and rat hairs are allowed in your food in the grocery store? Just keep trusting Corporate America to look out for you! It sure is working out well.

Unfortunately the pro-pasteurized milk side is adamantly against anyone challenging their dogmatic viewpoint.\nYou don\u2019t hear about any government crusade against raw spinach after contaminated spinach from Earthbound Organics was responsible for deaths across the nation (the water they irrigated with was contaminated by the industrial cow farm upstream); you don\u2019t hear about any crusade against processed beef or industrial chicken, which are on the government\u2019s own top 10 list of the most likely means of food-borne illness. Raw milk wasn\u2019t anywhere near the top 10 \u2013 why? because only about 24 \u2013 48 (depending on the list you used) in the past several decades were attributable to consumption of raw milk intended for consumption as raw milk.\nSara\nsays:\nApril 5, 2012 at 1:51 pm\nI am amazed that Dr. Dana wrote a post about the rise in autism just two weeks ago and now writes about the supposed dangers of raw milk. Is is not difficult to see that this rise in autism has a direct correlation to the man made fats, gmo corn, soy, and other veggies, pesticides, antibiotics, grain fed animals, and in general the processed non-foods that our nation is consuming at alarming rates. Altering milk with pasteurization and homogenization creates a non-food that our bodies do not recognize, thus causing our bodies to react in horrible ways including cancer, fertility issues, ADHD, and autism. The \u201cfear\u201d that it is dangerous is just nonsense- it is simply our government feverishly reacting to their inability to control the rising economy of organic, locally grown, real food. They don\u2019t make money from lobbyists like they would from commercial sized grower\u2019s products. In fact there have been 35,000x more cases of salmonella from pasteurized milk than raw milk. The only milk my family will ever consume is raw. Once you are thoroughly educated in real food it\u2019s a frightening thought to return to \u201cfood-like\u201d products the western world has created in science labs.

I helped them with their menu!)\nIf you want that destination where great fish meets great sake then head to Umi ( http://umisf.com/ ) and tell owners Stewart, Shamus and Russell that Beau sent you. These guys know their fish and they are quite keen on the sustainable fish program - so eat with confidence. Also they know their sakes very well ( http://umisf.com/menu ) so drink with confidence!\nPS - I love Stewart's octopus! Superb - but don't eat it all or at least save me a few pieces!\nSake Events - Sake Brewery Tours\nOver the years I have been asked countless times \"How can I visit sake breweries?\" and for years I said that if you are lucky then there is a remote chance that a brewery will open their doors to \"outsiders.\" But I also said, \"don't hold your breath!\" Guess what? You can breathe again because you are in luck! My dear friend Etsuko Nakamura heard all of your pleas and she decided to do something about it! Here is a quick email from her:\nHey Beau, I would appreciate if you could announce to your readers the start of the Sake World Sake Brewery Tours program. Now anyone can access the inner workings of the sake world. Visit Japan, start off with a bit of formal sake education by John Gauntner, then visit several breweries to meet the artisans and learn about them in depth. Tours include dinners each evening designed to match local sake-including the freshest shinshu-and cultural exploration of the region. There are two full-service tours: Tour I: February 23 to 27 in the Kansai (Osaka/Kyoto/Kobe) area Tour II: March 15 to 19 in the San-in (Shimane and Tottori) area For more information, pricing, and reservations please go to http://saketours.com . Participation is extremely limited!\nEtsuko also left some elegant handouts at the store for those who would like to see something in hand form! This is truly a wonderful opportunity and I would jump at this offering if you ever wanted to get up close and into it in a brewery while they are brewing! (Unheard of!)\nSake Socks - BT Designs Socks for Sake World\nA very good friend of mine (Sven Wiederholt), who is one of the most creative \"dudes\" in the creative world, and also one hell of a photographer (he slums it and helps us shoot our bottles for the website) asked me to design a sock that symbolizes the sake world. Hmmmmm! I thought. Should it be clich\u00e9 and have little bottles or be in the typical brown or green bottle color? Should it be blunt and have some sake serving device or drinking cup? Should it look like a wooden drinking box? Nope!\nI decided to go a little more \"subtle\" and train my focus on one of my favorite components of the sake industry - the maekake or sake apron that we wear in the shop. Think those cool dark blue aprons with bold white kanji and orange string ties. Yes, that is the design and I just took 40 pairs over to Japan and gave them to a bunch of brewers and sake folks, who were blown away. (They loved saying \"Sake Socks\") (I love saying my maekake sake socks!)\nWe have a dozen pairs in the store for sale and will get more - had to re-load after the Japan trip! (By the way, these high-end socks are made in Japan and are quality personified) You may purchase at True Sake or at Sven's website.\nCheck them out here: Office Wiederholt Store\nThis is truly a one of a kind piece of sake lore - so get yours now! (Great X-mas gift!)\nSake Challenge - Sake vs. German Food!\nI am on a spiritual sake quest that will finally put a nail in the coffin of \"sake can only be consumed at a sushi restaurant\" mantra. Wake up people! Food and sake go together - always have and always will. If it has a tail, roots, feathers, leaves, or a damn beak sake will go with it - anytime and any place. And that is my quest - the place or origin of the cuisine does not matter. It can be Spanish, Italian, Brazilian or ughhhh British chow and sake will walk the walk. Japan has chickens! Japan has salad! Japan has beef! Japan has spicy and savory dishes! Japan has sweet and salty fare, so why not think about having sake with these \"tones\" from other countries?\nThe Sake Challenge is my way for you great consumers to see outside of the sushi paradigm, and to achieve this \"new view on brew\" I will usually select two different sake styles and price-points and bring them to a non-Japanese restaurant with a celebrity, sake-sleuth or hell even a friend in tow.

For beef, the leanest cuts are round, loin, and sirloin. Ground beef is higher in fat than these cuts; if you are cooking hamburger or meatballs, buy \u201cextra-lean ground beef,\u201d which has roughly 10% fat (compared with 20% or 25% in other ground meat). The leanest cut of chicken and turkey is the breast (white meat); of pork, the tenderloin. The leanest cuts of lamb are the leg, loin roast, and chops.\nIn addition, the healthiest meats come from \u201cfree-range\u201d animals raised without antibiotics in the feed. Free-range cattle are less likely to develop infections (and need antibiotic treatment) than animals raised factory-style in tight pens.\nHigh-quality fish can be fresh or frozen within hours of being harvested. When buying whole fish, the scales should be intact and colorful \u2014 color fades along with freshness. The eyes should be bright and the gills red and without slime. When buying fresh fillets, examine the flesh. It should be moist and elastic and should not be brown or dry at the edges. Frozen seafood should have solid flesh, no discoloration, and little or no odor.\nGrading meat\nLabels on beef and poultry indicate their grade, or quality. But they are also a key to fat content. The highest grades contain the most fat, because fat content makes the meat tender.\nPrime\nBeef or lamb cuts with the most marbling, or fat\nChoice\nBeef or lamb cuts with less marbling than prime\nSelect\nLean cuts of beef\nGrade A\nThe highest quality poultry, the grade usually sold in retail markets. It has no defects such as bruises and broken bones. Lower grades of poultry are used in processed meat products. If you see poultry in your supermarket that\u2019s not graded, it\u2019s not Grade A.\nBuying grains and beans\nLook for \u201cwhole wheat\u201d or another whole grain as the first ingredient in bread and rolls. In addition, consider whole-wheat pasta, which has a lower glycemic load than white pasta. Similarly, brown rice has a lower glycemic load than white rice. For variety, try some healthy alternatives to these grains, such as couscous, bulgur, or quinoa.\nLentils, chickpeas, kidney beans, peanuts, and other legumes are important sources of vegetable protein. They come either dried or canned. Dried beans have a slight edge over canned beans because they are unprocessed and have no added salt. But they must be cooked, a process that can require overnight soaking. Canned beans are more convenient when you\u2019re pressed for time because they\u2019re already cooked. You can reduce their salt content by rinsing them in a strainer under cold water before preparing a meal with them.\nShopping for fruits and vegetables\nThe healthiest fruits and vegetables are picked fresh. The longer they are stored, the more nutritional value (and taste) they lose. Frozen fruits and vegetables are almost as tasty and nutritious as fresh-picked ones, and they may be even better than fresh produce that was picked unripe and then stored for weeks. Select a variety of fruits and vegetables, concentrating on the most deeply colored ones because they contain substances that have healthful effects (see \u201cFruits and vegetables\u201d). Have a spinach salad instead of iceberg lettuce, for example. Eat sweet potatoes or yams instead of white-fleshed potatoes.\nIn addition, choose fruits and vegetables that are in season (strawberries in the spring, zucchini in late summer). They are more likely than out-of-season produce to have been grown locally (or at least domestically) and not stored for long periods. It\u2019s also worth considering organic produce because it has lower levels of pesticide residues than other produce.\nYou can tell a lot about the condition of fruits and vegetables by looking at them and feeling them. Greens should not be wilted. Carrots should be crisp, not limp. Peaches, nectarines, and cantaloupes should be slightly soft, but not mushy. Brown spots on fruits and vegetables are signs of spoiling. On the other hand, produce that is too perfect-looking is not always desirable. Shiny, flawless skin on apples, peppers, and cucumbers is a sign that they have been coated in a pesticide wax. Although the wax can be washed off with soap and water, you\u2019re better off avoiding it entirely.\nBrowsing the dairy case\nBecause regular milk, cheese, and other milk products contain saturated fat, look for nonfat or low-fat versions. Nonfat milk has just 1 gram of fat per cup, compared with 8 grams in whole milk. Low-fat (1%) milk has 2 grams of fat per cup. The yogurts with the least fat are those made with skim or low-fat milk instead of whole milk or cream. Be aware that most cheese has a lot of fat even if it\u2019s labeled \u201clow-fat.\u201d Although a half-cup of low-fat cottage cheese has just 1 gram of fat, low-fat ricotta cheese has a whopping 10 grams of fat per half-cup.\nWhen choosing frozen desserts, keep in mind that the gourmet or premium brands often have lots of unhealthy saturated fat. A half-cup of gourmet ice cream has 12 grams of fat because it\u2019s made with cream. Compare that to the low-fat products or frozen yogurt with 3 grams. Even better, try sherbet with only 2 grams, or sorbet with none. Remember that all these products are laden with added sugars; they\u2019re not health foods by any stretch of the imagination.\nFor safety\u2019s sake, always be sure to buy milk and milk products that are pasteurized. Pasteurization uses heat to kill off germs during processing. Don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that unpasteurized products are healthier or purer. Pasteurization has significantly reduced the incidence of diseases transmitted by milk. Another way to guard against contamination is to buy milk and other dairy products (including eggs) before the \u201csell by\u201d date.\nEating out\nIn general, the foods in restaurants are not as healthy as the foods you prepare at home. For one thing, they\u2019re more likely to be high in bad fats, high in glycemic load, or both. It\u2019s not obvious, but butter is in everything in many restaurants \u2014 chefs like the flavor and are trained to use it liberally even on those healthy-looking fresh vegetables.\nAnother down side of restaurant eating is portion size. Food is relatively cheap in this country, and as a result portions are often overly large, especially in fast-food restaurants. But if you\u2019re smart about what you order, you can get a healthy meal \u2014 including dessert \u2014 when eating out. Here are some guidelines.\nAvoid fried foods. Frying adds more fat to a food than broiling, baking, or saut\u00e9ing. Restaurant fryers often use hydrogenated oils, a source of harmful trans fat.\nAvoid dishes prepared with gravy and heavy sauces. Because gravy is often made with fatty pan drippings from meat, it is relatively high in saturated fat. Many sauces are made with cream, which is also high in saturated fat.\nAsk the waiter how large the entr\u00e9es are. If they\u2019re bigger than the meals you usually eat, consider ordering an appetizer instead or sharing an entr\u00e9e with someone else. And you don\u2019t have to eat everything on your plate. Take home your leftovers for tomorrow\u2019s lunch.\nFind out how dishes are prepared. Ask whether a meal you\u2019re interested in is made with butter or animal fat. If it is, consider asking that the dish be prepared with olive oil instead, or that it be baked, steamed, or saut\u00e9ed with less fat. Steer clear of meals that are prepared with a lot of cheese or cream.\nEat a light healthy snack such as a piece of fruit or some carrots before going out. That way, you won\u2019t be so ravenous when you arrive at the restaurant that you\u2019ll gorge on the bread served at the table (which will probably be white bread and, therefore, have a high glycemic load).\nShare desserts. If you want a sweet dessert, consider sharing it with others at your table. You\u2019ll get the full taste, but just a fraction of the calories, sugar, and bad fats.\nCopyright Harvard Health Publications - 2006\n"}, {"score": 276.10962, "uuid": "fdd90894-1e20-51b8-b730-92b32dfa2a7f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-35-18954", "target_hostname": "www.slowfoodireland.com", "target_uri": "http://www.slowfoodireland.com/index.php/food/features/112-raw-milk.html?q=%2Findex.php%2Ffood%2Ffeatures%2F112-raw-milk.html&showall=1", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Raw Milk", "snippet": "The relative efficiency of certified and <em>pasteurized</em> milk in infant feeding.

Between 1998 and 2005, there were over 10,000 documented outbreaks that contributed to 199,263 documented cases of foodborne illness. Raw milk was associated with 0.4 % of these cases. Again, there is no way to quantify whether any one of these foods is safer than another from this data, but it is clear that there is no basis for singling out raw milk as \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d or that investigating it was more costly.\nThe \u2018reputation\u2019 of American food has been far more damaged by its extreme industrial practices. There are increasing outbreaks of E.Coli 0157:H7 in minced beef, water, lettuce and spinach.(l) A study by researchers in Kansas State University in 2008 found higher levels of E.Coli 0157:H7 in the faeces of cattle fed a diet that included distillers grain, a by-product of ethanol, that is cheaper than corn. Confinement dairy operations are now routinely placed near ethanol production plants so the cows can be fed chemically polluted ethanol swill.\nAmerica\u2019s food reputation is not helped by the inclusion of growth hormones, GM ingredients, high levels of denatured vegetable oils, salts and sugars. There is an epidemic of obesity, diabetes and heart failure amongst the poorer section of their society that eats predominately cheap processed foods.\nThe USFDA is very opposed to raw milk production and constantly campaigns against it. Raw milk producers are often raided and consumers are warned against the \u2018dangers\u2019 of drinking raw milk. However, the consumption of raw milk continues to surge. This year the states of Massachusetts, Minnesota, Washington and Wyoming have introduced legislation to legalise the sales of raw milk. Similar Bills are being introduced in Iowa, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin. Sales of raw milk are already allowed in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, South Carolina and Washington and most of the other states allow it to be sold on the farm.\nMuch of the research demonstrating the health benefits of raw milk was conducted prior to the 1960s and is therefore not indexed in databases such as PubMed. Modern experimental methods, tools of biochemical analysis, and methods of pasteurisation are needed to reevaluate the question to the satisfaction of academic scientists and policy experts \u2013 but there is a large gulf between something that is \u201cas yet largely unsubstantiated\u201d and something that has been refuted. The former implies that the claims have been partially substantiated and may be fully substantiated in the future.\nMany people who consume raw milk rely on anecdotal evidence of its superiority, including but not limited to their own experiences. Although anecdotal evidence is not sufficient to confirm a hypothesis, it is a valid means for generating one. Whether it is sufficient means for acting on one is a personal decision that every individual should have a right to make.\nThe fact is that there exists an overwhelming set of observations recorded in the scientific literature justifying interest in the benefits of raw milk.\nProtective components of unprocessed milk; Raw milk contains numerous components that assist in:\no Killing pathogens in the milk (lactoperoxidase, lactoferrin, leukocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, antibodies, medium chain fatty acids, lysozyme, B12 binding protein, bifidus factor, beneficial bacteria);1\no Preventing pathogens from being absorbed across the intestinal wall (polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, mucins, fibronectin, glycomacropeptides, bifidus factor, beneficial bacteria);2 and\no Strengthening and modulating the immune system (lymphocytes, immunoglobulins, antibodies, hormones and growth factors).3\no Note that breast milk is raw. The safety and health benefits of breast milk have been well documented.4\nLoss of protective components due to pasteurisation; Many of these anti-microbial and immune-enhancing components are greatly reduced in effectiveness by pasteurisation.5\nLoss of nutrients due to pasteurisation; 6\nVitamin A\nBeta-lactoglobulin, a heat-sensitive protein in milk, increases intestinal absorption of vitamin A. Heat degrades vitamin A.7\nB Vitamins (incl. folate)\nSignificant percentages of Vitamins B6, B12, thiamin and folate are destroyed by heat treatment, although the specific percentages found vary from study to study.8 In addition, the folacin-binding protein in raw milk is rendered ineffective during pasteurization and processing.9\nVitamin C\nHeating leads to a loss of Vitamin C in pasteurized milk.10 \u201cWithout doubt, the explosive increase in infantile scurvy during the latter part of the 19th century coincided with the advent of use of heated milks and proprietary foods. \u2026 Hess [a pediatrician] was able to effect a cure for scurvy by providing raw milk or orange juice or potatoes.\u201d11\nVitamin D\nVitamin D is present in milk in protein-bound form, which may be lost during pasteurization.12\nHealth benefits of raw milk; Raw milk is the only food that has built-in safety mechanisms and numerous components to create a healthy immune system. The FSA 00/05/04 review acknowledges that long-term consumers of raw milk may be immunologically privileged as a result of this consumption.\nIn early studies involving humans, raw milk was shown to be superior to pasteurised in protecting against infection, rickets, and TB; and children receiving raw milk had better growth than those receiving pasteurized milk.13\nSeveral recent studies in Europe have found that drinking \u201cfarm\u201d (raw) milk protects against asthma and allergies.15\nInfants and premature babies on pasteurised human milk did not gain weight as quickly as those fed raw human milk; problems were attributed to pasteurisation\u2019s destruction of lipase.16 In another study, neonates given raw human milk had a markedly lower incidence of infection than those who received pasteurised human milk and formula.17\nThe study published in The Lancet (Riedler et al, 2001) indicates that children who drink \u2018farm milk\u2019 \u2013 independent of other types of exposure to farming environments \u2013 had a 52 percent lower risk of asthma, 57 per cent lower risk of having at least 1 wheeze attack in the past year, a 76 per cent lower risk of hay fever and an 85 per cent lower risk of allergies to cows, dust mites, cat dander and pollen. The authors noted that \u2018farm milk\u2019 is \u2018usually raw\u2019 and contains more bacteria than pasteurised milk. They suggested that \u2018the ingestion of non-infectious microbial components\u2019 in the raw milk or the milk\u2019s effects on intestinal flora might protect against the development of allergies.\nThere are many more anecdotal reports of potential benefits of raw milk that the scientific establishment has not yet addressed. Consumers, however, should not be at the mercy of funding institutions that control which of these issues are researched; they should have the right to put into their bodies the milk of their own choosing.\nThere is clearly no basis on which to claim raw milk is more dangerous than other foods commonly consumed. Producers and consumers of raw milk have a fundamental right to be treated fairly under the law that they are clearly being denied.\nOur government should be helping farmers to produce raw milk safely, and the FSAI should be providing us with a sober and balanced report on the safety and merits of raw milk rather than dismissing it without proper consideration. Making raw milk into a contraband product encourages illegal trade with all the consequent problems.\nClearly, the demand for raw milk \u2013 because of its superior taste and health value \u2013 is not going away. It fact it is a growing phenomenon.\u00a0 The government cannot do anything to ensure the safety of raw milk if it is illegal. Only an open system of private or governmental oversight and certification will ensure that consumers have access to safely produced, healthy raw milk.\nRegulations should be appropriate to the risk. We feel there are many more important threats to the public e.g. pesticides, added chemicals, high levels of sugar, salts, saturated and trans fats in processed foods. Trans fats are banned in Denmark. I understand that they are still legal here.\nWe suggest the establishment of a register of licensed producers who undertake an agreed, greater than normal surveillance of herd health and milk quality.\u00a0Best practice in other jurisdictions can be used as a model for such a protocol which with mandatory labelling e.g. \u201cmay contain pathogens\u201d.\nDirect sales are important economic routes to market for primary producers that should not be 'given away' without a very good reason. The future of food production in Ireland requires primary producers to receive as large a share as possible of the consumer\u2019s price.\nThe open and legal sale of raw milk produced according to high standards is the safest solution to the public demand for nature\u2019s perfect food.\nYours sincerely,\nSlow Food Ireland\nReferences\na.

We were astonished by the turnout \u2013 standing room only \u2013 approx 90 people some of whom had travelled from Sligo, Limerick, Tipperary and West Cork. Catherine gave a balanced and informative account of her research and then she fielded a spirited Q & A session from the audience. The subject evoked strong feelings and the frustration of some members of the audience was evident. There was a strong feeling that there should be freedom of choice for those who feel strongly that unpasteurised milk from a clean herd can have health benefits for themselves and their children. Slow Food is requesting the FSAI and DAF draw up a protocol for best practice for dairy farmers who wish to produce raw milk for human consumption.\nDarina Allen\nLetter from Slow Food Ireland to the Minister for Agriculture on consumption of Raw Milk\nTuesday, 9th November 2010\nMinister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food\nAgriculture House\nDublin 2\nDear Minister Smith\nShould the Government be considering changing the regulations on the production and sale of raw milk in Ireland we would like to emphasize that a significant lobby wish that the FSAI would ask the Department of Agriculture to draw up a protocol for best practice for the production and sale of unpasteurised milk to the 100,000 and Irish people who currently avail of it.\nI understand the corporate memory of Tuberculosis and Brucellosis in the 1950\u2019s but today standards are very different and people deserve a choice.\u00a0 Other EU countries have found a solution to this dilemma and it would seem grossly unfair if Irish people were to be deprived of the opportunity to choose.\u00a0 In the US, the sale of raw milk is permitted in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Washington.

My sister asked me a couple of years ago what I would like for my birthday. My response was a vinegar pot I had seen in a catalog.( Thanks Danette for the pot.) I had made my own vinegar and was completely hooked on it. I had one woman who tried my vinegar, then emailed me begging to buy some from me. She said she drank apple cider vinegar regularly but had never tasted any like mine and was craving it after tasting it. Homemade vinegar is different from\u00a0 store-bought vinegar. It has a rich taste and loaded with health giving properties. This too is a cultured food and makes the best vinaigrette and sauces. You can dip into your pot to deglaze a pan or make a salad dressing or marinades. It is made very similar to kombucha and really just takes time as any cultured food would. It takes about a month or two to make a pot, but you only have to make it once or twice a year. You can even flavor your vinegar with fresh rosemary sprigs. Just add a couple springs to your vinegar when your done.\nI\u2019m not the only crazy that makes my own vinegar. I\u2019ve heard that all French farm kitchens have a crock of rich deep- flavored vinegar working away some where. I have some French blood in me maybe this is where I get it from. My grandpa would be proud.\nYou will need a vinegar with what they call a mother. This means that it hasn\u2019t been pasteurized you will see sediment at the bottom of the bottle and most of them say \u201cwith the Mother\u201d, or unpasteurized vinegar.

Check it occasionally and sniff it. It will gradually take on a distinct vinegar smell and you will notice a slight film on the top.\nWhen the mixture taste and smells like vinegar pour a third and place it in airtight bottles.\nSave the culture and extra vinegar and replace with equal amounts of apple cider and start the process again. The process will take less time so check it often. Mine has been done as soon as two weeks.\nYou can also bottle all of it and throw away the culture.\nYou can also make red wine vinegar or white wine vinegar using the same recipe but you have to find a red and white wine vinegar with the mother in it.

Hosted by Dennis Stoltzfoos and Florida A & M University.\nBy Alex Roarty, Sentinel Reporter , August 19, 2007\nOn most days, people passing by the family farm of Newville resident Mark Nolt would see cows grazing on grass and children playing in the field.\nTwo weeks ago, people would have also seen police raiding his barn.\nAbout six police officers and a handful of trucks paid Nolt a visit to confiscate his hold of illegal unpasteurized milk and other dairy products. The raid came after Commonwealth Court injunction in July ordered him to stop selling the dairy products, and after a judge found Nolt in contempt of court on Aug. 2 for disobeying the order.\nThe dispute is simple: The government says so-called \"raw\" milk, yogurt and cheeses could make customers ill, but Nolt says pasteurizing milk does as much harm as good and the government is infringing on his civil rights.\n\"The Constitution clearly spells out we have the right do private business,\" Nolt said. \"And the Constitution spells out life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"\nPennsylvania law forbids selling raw milk without a permit, according to Chris Ryder, a spokesman for the state Department of Agriculture. He also said farmers are not allowed to sell almost any raw dairy product, like soft cheeses or yogurt, even with a permit because their longer shelf life makes them too unsafe.\nAlthough a debate about pasteurization sounds more appropriate for 1907 than 2007, Nolt is not alone. Raw milk proponents have sprung up across the country recently to argue against a process regarded as one of the biggest boons to public health of the last century.\nOn July 4, a Washington D.C.-based food advocacy group formed a legal defense fund to help give farmers the right to sell raw products.\nNolt said pasteurization kills as much good bacteria and vitamins as it kills harmful bacteria.\n\"It would destroy natural vitamins and goodness of milk and milk product,\" Nolt said.\nAnd, he said, raw milk and its various products taste better.\nBut Ryder said drinking raw milk can be harmful.\nHe said Nolt might be endangering customers, especially the elderly and children, because without a permit the milk has greater potential to make somebody ill.\n\"We do not get any reports of people getting ill from pasteurized milk,\" he said. \"We do get reports from people drinking raw milk.\"\nHe said the state has decreased the risk of drinking raw milk with the permit system because inspectors can make sure barns are clean and cows healthy. But he said even then, people still run a risk when drinking the milk.\nStill, Nolt, who at one time did own a permit but dropped it because it did not apply to most non-milk dairy products, said he defied the court order because he thought his customers deserved unpasteurized milk.\n\"We would feel very bad not doing for our customers what we would want them to do for us,\" Nolt said.\nBut if Nolt continues to sell raw dairy products, he said the police told him he will go to jail.\nThe loss of business has been a hardship on his family, he said, but his religion helped him persevere.\nHe even took his police \"visit\" in good humor.\n\"The 'visit' was what really amused us,\" Nolt said. \"It was a full-scale raid.\"\nJul 28, 2007--Annual Consumer membership fee reduced to $50. Good news for consumer members! \"We have listened and responded to the many requests of consumers who want to join the Fund to support their farmers.

Although regular sales of unpasteurized milk products currently are illegal, a new bill would lift that ban. Kyle McDaniel/Wisconsin State Journal\nBy Natasha Anderson, Steve Horn, Sarah Karon and Rory Linnane\nWisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism\nCarrying a cooler of raw milk, Wisconsin vegetable farmer Brian Wickert climbs the steps of the state Capitol on a sunny April day. He is a man on a mission: to lobby for legislative support for a bill to legalize sales of unpasteurized milk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s real simple,\u201d Wickert, a member of the lobbying group Wisconsin Raw Milk Association , says in a later interview. \u201cWe want the right to choose the food we eat. Why does the government care whether I want to go and drink raw milk? Am I so stupid that I don\u2019t know the risks?\u201d\nFor Wickert, this bill is about having the freedom to live without interference from the government. But for health officials in America\u2019s Dairyland, it\u2019s about potentially exposing unsuspecting citizens to disease-causing bacteria. At the crux of this debate is the age-old question: How much should government protect its citizens from possible hazards?\nThat question took on increased urgency this month after bacteria in raw milk from an unnamed farm sickened at least 16 fourth graders and family members at a Racine County event, resulting in one hospitalization. The June 3 after-school party was designed to celebrate Wisconsin food.\n\u201cI got very, very sick,\u201d says Melissa Werner, 40, who drank raw milk at the event with her son, Nathan, 10. Both later suffered from nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and high fever. Werner was ill for two weeks, losing 12 pounds.\n\u201cStill, even now, when I eat, I can tell things aren\u2019t 100 percent right,\u201d she says.\nCheryl Mazmanian, a health officer with the Western Racine County Health Department, says while the incident in Raymond illustrates the dangers of raw milk, it violated no state laws.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not illegal to drink raw milk, it\u2019s not illegal to give it to people, but it is illegal to sell it,\u201d Mazmanian says.\nWisconsin is one of 11 states that prohibit regular sales of raw milk, according to the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund , a pro-raw milk group.\nRaw milk can contain disease-causing bacteria that the pasteurization process is designed to kill. Wisconsin law allows \u201cincidental\u201d sales of raw milk products to farm employees or visitors who buy on an ad-hoc basis. Those products include buttermilk, kefir, yogurt, cottage cheese, ice cream, butter and cheese.\nTo get around the law, in some cases, farmers create programs in which consumers become part owners of cows or farms to get a regular supply of raw milk. While some of those arrangements were condoned by state officials for several years, the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection ( DATCP ) in 2008 warned that such arrangements were illegal and began cracking down on raw-milk operations.\nIn other instances, people ignore the law, creating a type of black market in which consumers and farmers keep their transactions quiet to avoid regulatory scrutiny.\nOne of the customers is Sen. Glenn Grothman , R-West Bend, one of the co-sponsors of the bill introduced in May that would legalize raw milk sales. He says he gets milk from different farms but would not specify which ones \u2014 a common response among raw milk consumers.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to answer those questions because it jeopardizes your farmer. It\u2019s a screwy system,\u201d Wickert says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people\u2019s lives and livelihoods in the balance.\u201d\nThe measure co-sponsored by Grothman and Rep. Don Pridemore , R-Hartford, would allow farmers to sell raw milk directly to consumers. Pridemore says he\u2019s open to adding testing requirements to the bill, which it currently lacks.\n\u201cMy main goal is to get a public hearing to present reasons to make it a better bill,\u201d he says.\nBut one top official, Dr. Jim Kazmierczak, state public health veterinarian, warns that even daily testing cannot detect all contamination. Cows can shed bacteria intermittently, he says, so a negative test in the morning might not mean milk collected from the same cow in the afternoon is safe.\nLast year, a similar bill with more health safeguards was vetoed by Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. At the time, the governor expressed concerns about the safety of unpasteurized milk, which some consumers drink for its perceived health benefits.\nLike many of the roughly 15 farmers and consumers who came with Wickert to lobby, Grothman and Pridemore drink raw milk regularly.\n\u201cI drank it. I drank a lot of it, and I don\u2019t consider it risky behavior,\u201d Grothman says.\nPublic health officials disagree. In 2010, raw milk products caused 28 disease outbreaks in the United States that sickened 159 people, according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nRaw milk has caused seven disease outbreaks in Wisconsin since 1998, including the incident in Raymond, state health officials say. The outbreaks sickened at least 277 people; 28 were hospitalized. Six outbreaks were caused by campylobacter bacteria from cow manure that got into raw milk and raw cheese curds, causing illness but no death.\nMany officials, including Mazmanian, are particularly concerned about the possibility of children, who are more vulnerable to infection, consuming raw milk.\n\u201cThey were told there would be \u2018whole farm-fresh raw milk,\u2019 \u201d she says, referring to the Racine County event. \u201cNow, did they understand it was unpasteurized? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nWerner was aware that the milk at the North Cape Elementary School event was unpasteurized but says she did not fully understand the health risks.\n\u201cI\u2019m not opposed to the legalization, I just think there should be some testing and standards in place to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Werner says. \u201cBecause I do really worry about younger children not being able to handle being as sick as I was.\u201d\nA statement from Republican Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s office says he would support legislation allowing the limited sale of raw milk in Wisconsin, provided certain safety provisions are in place.\n\u201cThe bill would need to contain the appropriate safeguards to protect public health and the integrity of our state\u2019s signature industry, while giving consumers the opportunity to purchase raw milk directly from farmers,\u201d Walker press secretary Cullen Werwie says.\nEthan, foreground, Elly, and their mother, Becky Sell, visit the store at Vernon Hershberger's organic dairy farm near Loganville in June 2010. Hershberger is among those who believe Wisconsin should allow regular sales of raw milk products. He has defied orders by state officials to stop the sales. Kyle McDaniel/Wisconsin State Journal\nThe next raw milk state?\nThe raw milk bill introduced in May leaves out many safety regulations recommended in a 261-page report written by the Raw Milk Policy Working Group . Members include 22 Wisconsin dairy experts with a variety of opinions on raw milk, including academics, public health officials, and representatives of DATCP, dairy and cheese producers and agricultural groups.\nThe working group was appointed by Rod Nilsestuen, then-secretary of DATCP, to recommend safety regulations in case raw milk sales were legalized in Wisconsin. The group\u2019s report, published Wednesday, calls for detailed regulations on storage, testing and sales of raw milk if they were legalized.\nUnder the 2011 bill, farmers would be required to post signs indicating they sell unpasteurized milk products, but they would not have to place warning labels on raw milk products or warn customers about the dangers of raw milk, as the previous bill required.\nFarmers who milk fewer than 20 cows would not need to have a license or grade A dairy permit to sell raw milk. The current bill also would allow farmers to advertise their raw milk products, something the 2010 bill prohibited.\nScott Rankin, chair of the Department of Food Science at UW-Madison and member of the working group, says the latest bill is not based on science.\n\u201cThis is shockingly simple,\u201d Rankin says of the bill. \u201cIt just omits so much of all the concerns around how you handle any food, let alone raw milk.\u201d\nGrothman says he is aware the group drafted recommendations, but did not read or incorporate them into his bill. He believes the working group was biased against raw milk, but credits members for trying to be balanced.\n\u201cThey did a lot of work and we\u2019re certainly going to look at them,\u201d Grothman says. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a compromise.\u201d\nRankin says he hopes legislators will consider the recommendations and amend the bill accordingly.\n\u201cWe sat for hours and hours contending with these issues and crafting policy. Ignore it at your own risk,\u201d Rankin says. \u201cIf you decide to write this in a vacuum, that\u2019s fine, but this is one where you need to do your homework. And the (DATCP) report was intended to be that homework.\u201d\nPassions strong on both sides of debate\nThere is a sharp ideological divide between those who support the legalization of raw milk and those who object. Some advocates argue the government should not limit their food choices. Public health officials, meanwhile, say the risks associated with drinking raw milk require regulation \u2014 if not an outright ban.\nVince Hundt, an organic farmer and member of the working group, says he supports the current bill without most of the working group\u2019s suggestions.\n\u201cThese are recommendations that state health officials, the dairy industry at large and professional food processors would like to see in the bill,\u201d Hundt says. \u201cThe consumers of raw milk and producers would like to simplify it very radically and say the only stipulation is that the milk must go directly from the farmer to the consumer.\u201d\nThe authors of the new bill do not believe legalizing raw milk sales poses a threat to public health.\n\u201cMost of us old timers grew up on drinking it anyway,\u201d Pridemore says. \u201cNatural milk tastes a lot better, first of all. Second of all, it\u2019s fresher. The farm that I buy it from, it\u2019s no more than two days old.\u201d\nBut public health officials warn that freshness does not ensure safety. Kazmierczak says fresh milk can be infected, and the risk of contamination exists at even the cleanest dairy operations.\nHe says it is impossible to keep floors, milking machines and cows\u2019 udders completely free of manure contamination. Bacteria can enter milk at several stages, including during milking, when it is piped into the bulk tank or during dispensing. Cows may also become infected by grooming one another, he says.\n\u201cI think some people \u2026 don\u2019t have a good sense of how minute the contamination could be and still result in milk contamination and human illness,\u201d Kazmierczak says.\nA man sits at the wheel of a milk truck operated by the Providence Dairy Company, 1916. The location of the photo is unknown, but it might be Brigham, Wis. Photo credit: Wisconsin Historical Society.\nDisease prompted pasteurization\nRaw milk, by definition, is not pasteurized. During pasteurization, milk is heated to between 145 and 160 degrees Fahrenheit for a short period to kill rapidly growing bacteria.\nConcern about unpasteurized milk dates to the late 1800s. As people moved from rural to urban areas, milk was transported longer distances and at higher temperatures. Many city dwellers, particularly children, grew sick and died from drinking contaminated milk.\nPublic health activists called for reform, and throughout the late 1800s and into the 1900s, state and local governments passed laws requiring pasteurization. The measures were successful. In 1938, about 25 percent of all U.S. food- or water-borne disease outbreaks were caused by contaminated milk. By 2007, that figure was less than 1 percent.\nMilwaukee adopted a pasteurization ordinance in 1920, and between 1949 and 1957, the Legislature passed a series of laws requiring milk dealers to have licenses and sell only pasteurized milk, banning raw milk sales by farmers and requiring that milk sold to the public adhere to grade A standards designed to promote sanitary milk production.\nThe danger: bacterial contamination\nRaw milk can contain multiple illness-causing bacteria, including E.coli, salmonella, listeria, brucellosis and campylobacter. One 1992 study found bacterial contamination in 25 percent of samples taken from raw milk stored in bulk tanks.\nThese pathogens pose infection threats particularly to the young, the elderly and pregnant women. In rare cases, bacteria can enter the bloodstream and cause paralysis, kidney failure and death.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than just a stomachache,\u201d Kazmierczak says. \u201cSalmonella in immunocompromised people or children can become invasive. It can cause bloodstream infections and meningitis.\u201d\nAdds Rankin, \u201cHealthy adults succumb to these kinds of illnesses every year. It tears your heart out.\u201d\nKazmierczak worries children might consume raw milk without their parents\u2019 knowledge.\n\u201cIf someone gets really sick and you have a kid that\u2019s on dialysis for six months, who\u2019s responsible for that?\u201d he says. \u201cFrankly, I think that any supporters of this (bill) have to be ready to bear at least partial responsibility for any illnesses that result.\u201d\nConsumers of raw milk say it is healthier than pasteurized milk. Health officials warn untreated dairy products can contain harmful bacteria. Wisconsin is one of 11 states that outlaws regular sales of raw milk products. Kyle McDaniel/Wisconsin State Journal\nNew bill short on restrictions\nAlthough the 2011 proposal requires raw milk distributors to use a sanitary container and to fill it in a sanitary manner, it does not set any standard for cleanliness. Grothman says it will be up to the consumer to find trustworthy suppliers.\n\u201cI think people who buy raw milk should familiarize themselves with the farmer,\u201d Grothman says.\nDavid Gumpert, author of the book, \u201cThe Raw Milk Revolution: Behind America\u2019s Emerging Battle Over Food Rights,\u201d believes pasteurization is not as crucial as it once was.\n\u201cWe understand the importance of sanitation and good animal health, not to mention that we have refrigeration and automated milking equipment, all of which reduce the chances of contamination,\u201d he says.\nTony Schultz, board member of Family Farm Defenders , a Madison-based nonprofit that seeks to create a farmer-controlled food system, believes health concerns about raw milk are overblown.\n\u201cEvery year you hear about thousands getting sick from some sort of \u2018big\u2019 food \u2014 beef, spinach, tomatoes,\u201d Schultz says, adding he believes if consumers bought directly from farmers, there would be fewer and smaller outbreaks.\nHe believes the debate is really about large corporate farms\u2019 desire to control the agricultural sector and the pushback from small farmers and consumers who want to have a closer relationship with their food.\nKazmierczak acknowledges that supporting family farms and local agriculture is \u201cemotionally appealing.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cThe bottom line is, the more available you make raw milk, the more people are going to drink it, and the more people are going to get sick.\u201d\nLegalization equals right to choose\nFor raw milk consumers, the heart of the issue is the right to choose their food.\n\u201cWe want good health. We want to be able to have the choice to drink what we know is good for us,\u201d says farmer and raw milk consumer Melody Morrell, who lives on a community-sustained farm in southwestern Wisconsin. \u201cThat makes sense to me. It\u2019s frustrating that someone can say \u2018No you can\u2019t,\u2019 even if it\u2019s the healthiest thing.\u201d\nHundt, the organic farmer, says the public should be trusted to make that choice.\n\u201cA consumer can walk to the store and buy a quart of gin or a carton of cigarettes, but you can\u2019t buy a gallon of milk from a farmer,\u201d Hundt says. \u201cIt\u2019s preposterous and symptomatic of a society that doesn\u2019t trust its citizens and abandoned the idea that people are free and should make these decisions for themselves.\u201d\nKazmierczak responds that government regulates all kinds of risky products.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t buy your kids lead toys from China, you can\u2019t serve them powdered milk that\u2019s got melamine in it,\u201d he says. \u201cSociety and government have decided that there are limits to parental autonomy, and, in my opinion, this should be one of them.\u201d\nMorrell, for one, is not worried. Her three children drink raw milk every day. She knows the farmer and the cow that produce it, and she trusts it is safe.\n\u201cI knew a lot of people growing up that drank raw milk,\u201d says Morrell, who was raised in rural Minnesota. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never met one person who\u2019s been sick from raw milk ever in my life.\u201d\nSarah Karon is a reporter for the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism.

Like many natural remedies much of the evidence is anecdotal. That's never been a deterrent for me as I have never believed in one size fits all remedies. (I pendulum test everything. Works for me.) However, a new scientific study concluded that echinacea does, in fact, prevent colds, by a substantial percentage, and seems to shorten the duration and severity of colds.\nThe paper , published in the July issue of The Lancet Infectious Diseases, used statistical techniques to combine the results of existing studies and reach conclusions based on the larger sample that resulted. The researchers selected only those trials that used randomized and placebo-controlled techniques: 14 studies involving 1,356 participants for the number of colds and 1,630 for the prevention of colds. The studies varied in the dosages of the herb, the duration it was taken and the species of echinacea used, and the number of participants ranged from 40 to more than 300.\nThe analysis concluded that echinacea reduced the risk of catching a cold by 58 percent. It also found that the herb significantly shortened the duration of a cold, but there was no general agreement about the magnitude of this effect.\n\u0093Our analysis doesn\u0092t say that the stuff works without question,\u0094 said Dr. Craig I. Coleman, an assistant professor of pharmacy practice at the University of Connecticut, and the senior author of the paper. \u0093But the preponderance of evidence suggests that it does.\u0094\nOn the subject of herbs, this might be a good time mention that one of my newest affiliates is Mountain Rose Herbs .

As the article makes clear, the FDA, CDC, and AMA have branded raw milk as dangerous, even though people all over the world have been drinking it that way since time immemorial. How is that the entire population of India didn't become extinct before pasteurization?! Hmmm...\nThe article is full of valuable info on the health benefits of dairy in its original state, but it is also a reminder of the flaw in allopathic medicine in the broader sense. The dependence on the \"disease model\" often negates any discussion of true health. The FDA says pasteurized milk is non-pathogenic and therefore healthy. But for some of us the absence of germs in our food is not enough. We require that there also be some nutrients that the body is capable of using. Nature still makes food better than technology does, and raw milk is a prime example.\nAmong the health benefits of raw milk from pastured (grass fed) cattle is a reduction of allergy symptoms like asthma, hay fever, and eczema. A number of the subjects of the Salon article came to raw milk as a last resort for those afflictions and turned their conditions around. And as reporter Hannah Wallace points out:\nA compelling new study, published in the June 2006 issue of the Journal of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, seems to lend support to what these three already know to be true. Researchers at the University of London analyzed the diet of 4,700 children in Shropshire and found that those who lived on farms and drank raw milk had significantly fewer symptoms of asthma, hay fever and eczema. Children who drank raw milk were 40 percent less likely to develop eczema and 10 percent less likely to get hay fever than their non-raw-milk-drinking peers. Blood samples showed that they had 60 percent lower levels of immunoglobulin E, an antibody released by the immune system when it's confronted by allergens. (IgE, in turn, causes cells to release histamines, which is what causes an allergic reaction.) In their conclusion, study authors Michael Perkins and David Strachan surmised that the lactobacilli found in raw milk protect against eczema. They also stated, \"Unpasteurized milk is known to be rich in a variety of gram-negative species and their lipopolysaccharides, and it is plausible that a persistent exposure to a diverse milieu of bacteria from an early age is likely to have an effect on the developing immune system.\"\nFor some of us the worst allergy is to dairy itself. I was diagnosed as dairy allergic many years ago, and I noticeably react to dairy products... unless they're raw. Allergic reactions to food occur because the body can't digest and process them properly. Pasteurized milk is effectively dead and, in the attempt to kill off any lurking pathogens, all the enzymes necessary to its proper digestion are also killed. Raw dairy, rich in the enzymes and cultures nature intended, is far more digestible, which means the body can actually utilize its protein, vitamins, and nutrients.\nBreezing through some of the blog entries and letters in response to this article, I'm unsurprised to find that many people are just terrified of raw milk and sure that it's very, very dangerous. But as the article makes clear, E. Coli and other dangerous pathogens have been found in a number of foods that have not been made illegal; like spinach. Taco Bell hasn't been closed down, despite it's recent traffic in contaminated food. How is that the FDA is so quick to demonize raw milk, but rely on testing and regulation for other foods that are at least as likely to be contaminated? The answer probably lies in the demands of industrial agribusiness. Pasteurization is a blanket solution to the problems of mass produced milk from sick cattle.\n\"Pasteurization is an excuse to produce dirty milk,\" says Los Angeles raw milk activist Rahman Dalrymple, citing the outbreaks of salmonella, listeria and Campylobacter that have all been traced to pasteurized milk. In California, accepted bacteria levels for Grade A raw milk are fewer than 15,000 colony-forming units per milliliter; accepted levels for raw milk destined for pasteurization is 50,000. (Post-pasteurization, milk in California can contain 15,000 CFUs per milliliter. States that adopt the FDA's Pasteurized Milk Ordinance allow pasteurized milk 20,000 CFUs per milliliter, one-quarter more than California's raw-milk limit.) Dalrymple, who credits raw milk with curing his asthma, emphasizes that he would never drink raw milk that's destined for pasteurization by a large industrial dairy. Not all raw milk is created equal, Dalrymple says. \"Raw milk is dangerous -- if you get it from one of these industrial dairies that have fecal matter and pus and blood in their milk. I would absolutely not drink that!\"\nThis distinction -- between raw milk that's destined for pasteurization and raw milk from a small, spotlessly clean dairy that's kept to higher standards precisely because the milk won't be pasteurized -- is a crucial one, and it's lost on public health officials like Sheehan, who seem to lump all raw milk into the same pathogen-contaminated vat. Industrial farms are dirty -- as the recent agri-expos\u00e9s \"Fast Food Nation\" and \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\" have proved. When Sheehan thinks of raw milk, in other words, he's thinking of milk from cows crowded together in barns, eating a diet of corn, and standing in their own manure. All the raw milk advocates I spoke to are against drinking this type of raw milk.\nIn fact raw milk may be less likely to be infected with pathogens than it's mass produced, pasteurized counterpart, because pastured cattle, using their four stomachs the way nature intended, produce milk that naturally defends against contamination.\nAnother reason no pathogens have ever been found in his milk, McAfee believes, is that it contains a host of active antibacterial components -- not just proteins like lactoferrin, but enzymes, bacteriocins, colicins and at least 25 beneficial bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidus, the same probiotics that are found in most yogurt. And all of those components, McAfee says, are destroyed during pasteurization. (In her book \"Nourishing Traditions,\" WAPF founder Fallon concurs: \"Pasteurization destroys these helpful organisms, leaving the finished product devoid of any protective mechanism should undesirable bacteria inadvertently contaminate the supply.\") To prove his theory, a few years ago, McAfee sent his milk and colostrum to a private lab and had both injected with high levels of the three pathogens. The bacterial counts of all three bugs decreased over time. And the conclusion of the scientist at BSK Labs? \"Raw colostrum and raw milk do not appear to support the growth of Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, and Listeria monocytogenes,\" stated the lab report. McAfee is so proud of his below-normal bacteria counts that he posts annual averages on his Web site.\nThe exact opposite is true of the corn-fed cattle that are the stock-in-trade of big, commercial farms.\nCows, like all other ruminants, are meant to eat grass. Yet, at the vast majority of U.S. dairies -- even organic ones -- cows subsist on corn feed. In \"The Omnivore's Dilemma,\" Pollan explains how eating a high-starch diet acidifies a cow's rumen, making the animal sick and eventually allowing bacteria to enter its bloodstream. A cow's corn diet can also make us sick: E. coli O157:H7 has been around only since the early '80s, when it likely evolved in the acidic guts of corn-fed cattle. (E. coli O157:H7 is so lethal because human stomachs, too, are acidic. We can kill off microbes that evolve in the neutral pH of a grass-fed cow's rumen, but not the acid-resistant strains such as E. coli O157:H7.)\nI'm fortunate to live in a state where producing and selling raw dairy products is legal and the farms certified to bring it to market are scrupulously inspected. And let me tell you there is no going back once you've experienced what milk, yogurt, and cheeses are supposed to taste like... and digest like.\nMeanwhile, the FDA has just announced that it's safe to eat meat and drink milk from cloned animals. In such an Orwellian universe, where raw milk from cows that have two biological parents is considered dangerous, while pasteurized milk from cloned cows is safe -- is it any wonder that a growing band of consumers don't trust FDA decisions?\n"}, {"score": 257.55054, "uuid": "d4c87c10-5c51-5a28-844a-abaea5b8b33a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0101wb-97-04048", "target_hostname": "www.celestialhealing.com", "target_uri": "http://www.celestialhealing.com/labels/Agribusiness.html", "page_rank": 1.3838983e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "Reflections Journal", "snippet": "Nature still makes food <em>better</em> <em>than</em> technology <em>does</em>, and raw milk is a prime example.

Genetically modified crops are now besieged by superweeds .\nThe gospel of high-tech genetically modified (GM) crops is not sounding quite so sweet in the land of the converted. A new pest, the evil pigweed, is hitting headlines and chomping its way across Sun Belt states, threatening to transform cotton and soybean plots into weed battlefields.\nIn late 2004, \u0093superweeds\u0094 that resisted Monsanto\u0092s iconic \u0093Roundup\u0094 herbicide, popped up in GM crops in the county of Macon, Georgia. Monsanto, the US multinational biotech corporation, is the world\u0092s leading producer of Roundup, as well as genetically engineered seeds. Company figures show that nine out of 10 US farmers produce Roundup Ready seeds for their soybean crops.\nSuperweeds have since alarmingly appeared in other parts of Georgia, as well as South Carolina, North Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri, according to media reports. Roundup contains the active ingredient glyphosate, which is the most used herbicide in the USA.\nYes, just as antibiotics have led to the creation of superbugs, Roundup infused crops are now overrun by herbicide resistant weeds.\nIn the U.S. alone, glyphosate use jumped by a factor of 15 between 1994 and 2005, CFS claims. And this herbicide gusher has given rise to a host of \"superweeds\" -- weeds that tolerate heavy doses glyphosate. How do farmers deal with superweeds? By jacking up the dose of glyphosate.\nThe trend of increased rate of glyphosate use is clear. For soybeans, per-acre applications of Monsanto's herbicide jumped by a factor of 2.5 between 1994 and 2006. Corn farmers didn't really embrace GMOs until 2002; accordingly, between 2002 and 2005, glyphosate use on corn \"jumped from 0.71 to 0.96 lbs./acre/year, a hefty 35% increase in just three years.\"\nFarmers of Roundup Ready crops appear to have entered a pesticide treadmill. They have to raise application rates to keep up with resistance; and every time they do, they create hardier and hardier weeds. Monsanto, which expects to rake in $1.4 billion in profit from Roundup sales alone this year, is evidently laughing its way to the bank.\nMore fun still: They're also producing pesticide resistant bugs. So, we've got that goin' for us. But, Michelle Obama should definitely use pesticides in her organic garden, because not using them makes the nice people at MACA \"shudder.\" Yeah.

And the conclusion of the scientist at BSK Labs? \"Raw colostrum and raw milk do not appear to support the growth of Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, and Listeria monocytogenes,\" stated the lab report. McAfee is so proud of his below-normal bacteria counts that he posts annual averages on his Web site.\nThe exact opposite is true of the corn-fed cattle that are the stock-in-trade of big, commercial farms.\nCows, like all other ruminants, are meant to eat grass. Yet, at the vast majority of U.S. dairies -- even organic ones -- cows subsist on corn feed. In \"The Omnivore's Dilemma,\" Pollan explains how eating a high-starch diet acidifies a cow's rumen, making the animal sick and eventually allowing bacteria to enter its bloodstream. A cow's corn diet can also make us sick: E. coli O157:H7 has been around only since the early '80s, when it likely evolved in the acidic guts of corn-fed cattle. (E. coli O157:H7 is so lethal because human stomachs, too, are acidic. We can kill off microbes that evolve in the neutral pH of a grass-fed cow's rumen, but not the acid-resistant strains such as E. coli O157:H7.)\nI'm fortunate to live in a state where producing and selling raw dairy products is legal and the farms certified to bring it to market are scrupulously inspected. And let me tell you there is no going back once you've experienced what milk, yogurt, and cheeses are supposed to taste like... and digest like.\nMeanwhile, the FDA has just announced that it's safe to eat meat and drink milk from cloned animals. In such an Orwellian universe, where raw milk from cows that have two biological parents is considered dangerous, while pasteurized milk from cloned cows is safe -- is it any wonder that a growing band of consumers don't trust FDA decisions?\n"}, {"score": 267.2287, "uuid": "10a65d3f-7aef-56bc-8bd3-730ea7b1b957", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0107wb-88-01940", "target_hostname": "www.foodmanitoba.ca", "target_uri": "http://www.foodmanitoba.ca/local-foods/dairy/", "page_rank": 1.325813e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Dairy | Food Manitoba - Local Farms.

All of these milks contain the same 16 essential nutrients.\nWhole milk (homogenized): Contains at least 3.25% milk fat (M.F.)\n2% milk: A portion of the milk\u2019s fat is removed and it becomes partly skimmed milk with 2% M.F.\n1% milk: A portion of the milk\u2019s fat is removed and it becomes partly skimmed milk with 1% M.F.\nSkim milk: Is virtually fat-free, with only about 0.1% fat.\nChocolate milk (and flavoured milk): Chocolate milk is flavoured fresh 1% or 2% milk and provides all the good nutrition of white milk and the same 16 nutrients.\nOther Types of Milk\nHalf-and-Half (10% milk fat [M.F.]): An equal blend of whole cream and milk.\nTable Cream (15% or 18% M.F.): A blend of cream and milk in a higher proportion of cream than Half-and-Half.\nWhipping Cream (32% or 36% M.F.): Whipping Cream is a thick and pourable cream that can be used in cooking and for whipping.\nButtermilk (0% M.F.): Buttermilk is skim milk that has been fermented in a process similar to making yogurt. As a result, part of the lactose (natural sugar in milk) is converted to lactic acid, which gives buttermilk its sour flavour.\nEvaporated Milk: About 60% of the water is evaporated from fresh skim, 2% or whole milk. Evaporated milk is available in cans and is usually sold with other shelf stable (UHT) milk.\nUHT Milk: Milk that has been heat-treated at an ultra-high temperature (138 to 158\u00b0C). UHT milk is usually sold in a Tetra Pak type box. Unopened UHT milk keeps for several months at room temperature. Once opened, it will stay fresh as long as regular milk and should be refrigerated. To know precisely, check the dates printed on the package.\nSweetened Condensed Milk: Made commercially by condensing milk to one-third of its original volume and then adding sugar. Sweetened condensed milk is available in cans in the baking section of the grocery store.\nPowdered Milk (Skim or Whole milk powder): Partly evaporated milk is heated and dried instantly. Powdered milk is made from whole or skim milk and is available in bags and in bulk. There are instant and regular formulas.\nLactose-Free Milk: Regular milk that has been processed to break down lactose (natural sugar) in milk to help people with lactose intolerance to easily digest milk.\nStoring, Preserving and Food Safety\nCan I Freeze Milk & Cream?\nMilk: can be frozen for up to 3 weeks, however, upon thawing it can separate and lose its smooth texture. Partly skimmed and skim milk freeze better than whole milk. If it separates upon thawing, beat it with an electric mixer or an immersion blender with the whip attachment.\nCream: does not freeze well. Upon thawing it can separate and lose its creamy texture. It is not recommended to freeze cream or baked goods made with whipping cream. If freezing foods such as soups or stews, add the cream after you reheat the thawed food.\nEvaporated milk: Once a can of evaporated milk has been opened, unused milk can be frozen in an airtight container with no adverse effects.\nFor information on freezing other dairy products visit: www.dairygoodness.ca\nHow to Store Milk\nWhen it comes to milk, there are a number of things that you can do to keep it fresh. Here are some handy tips and tricks to get the most from your milk:\nMilk & Cream:\nRefrigerate at 4\u00b0C or colder as soon as possible after purchase.\nUse the freshest milk possible and use by the \u201cbest before date.\u201d\nReturn milk to the fridge as soon as possible. Do not let it sit at room temperature for any length of time.\nRemember to open new milk containers in the same order in which you bought them. First in the fridge, first out.\nKeep milk containers closed and store away from strong-smelling food items in the fridge \u2013 the milk can pick up those odours.\nStore milk on refrigerator shelves where it is cooler, rather than in the refrigerator doors.\nWhenever possible, leave milk in its original container to safeguard its flavour and food value.\nTo avoid spoilage, do not return unused milk or cream from a serving pitcher to the original container.\nEvaporated & UHT Milk:\nAll non-refrigerated, opened milk products are perishable. Opened containers of canned milk must be refrigerated. Opened canned milk should be immediately transferred to a clean glass container and should be covered. Use it within three weeks of opening.\nUnopened, UHT milk keeps for several months at room temperature. Once opened, it will stay fresh as long as regular milk and should be refrigerated. To know precisely, check the dates printed on the package.\nPowdered Milk:\nPowdered milk may be stored for up to one year in a cool and dry place. Be sure it is in an air-tight container or resealable bag.\nReconstituted milk (powdered milk mixed with water) can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 7 days. Label your milk with a \u201cbest-before\u201d date.\nPasteurization\nMilk in Manitoba is pasteurized to ensure consumers are offered a safe, high quality product. The pasteurization process involves heating milk to a specific temperature for a specific time in order to destroy potentially harmful bacteria. This process is mandatory for all the milk sold in Canada. The sale of raw milk or unpasteurized milk is illegal.\nPasteurization does not alter the taste or nutritional qualities of milk. Pasteurized milk is fortified with vitamin D, an essential vitamin that plays a role in the absorption of calcium\nCooking Tips and Techniques\nGive your recipes and family an instant flavour and nutrition boost using milk & cream.\nMilk Tips\nMake soups creamier, sauces smoother, casseroles more moist and desserts more delicious and nutritious by substituting milk for all or part of the water ingredient.\nWhen using packages of instant noodle side dishes use milk in the place of water.\nMake a richer and more nutritious hot chocolate from a powdered mix by replacing the water with milk.\nAdd calcium to your scrambled eggs by preparing them with milk instead of water.\nWhen making smoothies or milk shakes boost the protein (and calcium) by adding powdered milk.\nUse powdered milk instead of coffee whitener in coffee and tea. Skim milk powder is non-perishable, contains no fat, and is a source of calcium!\nPowdered milk mixed into meatloaf, meat balls or casseroles helps them hold shape their shape better and adds calcium. Add \u00bc cup powdered milk per pound of ground meat.\nEvaporated milk is sealed into cans and is heat tolerant, making it excellent for baked goods and slow-cooker recipes.\nCream Tips\nFor perfect whipped cream every time: Use a bowl just wide enough for the beater. Chill the bowl and the beaters before adding the cream. If you add sugar, do so after whipping the cream \u2013 never before.\nFor a little extra stabilizer to make sure whipped cream stays fluffy in the refrigerator or on a cake, for each cup (250 mL) whipping cream sift 1 Tbsp (15 mL) EACH powdered milk and icing sugar, to taste, over the almost-whipped cream, then beat it until stiff.\nTo add velvety texture to gravy, whisk Whipping cream until thickened, but not stiff, and stir into gravy just before serving.\nPour table cream or whipping cream into a plastic squeeze bottle and add finely chopped fresh herbs and salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle the herbed cream over soups for a restaurant style presentation.\nFor a quick, easy and terrific tasting sauce, pan-sear chicken, pork chops or veal cutlets, add whipping cream to the pan juices and bring to a boil, then simply season with mustard or fresh herbs.\nSweeten lightly whipped cream with maple syrup or liquid honey for an especially delicious topping for pancakes, waffles or French toast.\nFor an even more sublime texture, lightly whip whipping cream until thickened (but not stiff) before adding to pastas, soups and sauces.\nStir cream into your favourite curry at the end of cooking for a smoother and more elegant taste.\nAdd warmed cream to mashed potatoes to compliment a 5 star meal.\nSubstitutions with Milk & Cream\nWith great variety of milk products, comes great opportunity! Try the substitutions below if you don\u2019t have the following products in your kitchen.\nInstead of:\nTry:\nCream\nMilk, half and half, or table cream can be used in place of cream for most gently cooked sauces. For every 1 cup (250 mL) of cream, whisk 1 tbsp (15 mL) all-purpose flour or 2 tsp (10 mL) cornstarch into the milk before adding to the pan and cook, stirring, until the sauce is thickened.\nMilk\nFor 1 cup (250 mL) of milk, add \u00bd cup (125 mL) evaporated milk and \u00bd cup (125 mL) water.\nButtermilk\nFor 1 cup (250 mL) buttermilk, measure 1 tbsp (15 mL) lemon juice or vinegar into a liquid measuring cup and fill with milk to the 1 cup (250 mL) level; let stand for 5 minutes then stir and use in your recipe.\nSour Cream\nFor cold dips, in place of sour cream, substitute equal parts whipped cream and plain yogurt.\nCoconut milk\nFor 1 cup (250 mL) coconut milk, add 1/4 cup (50 mL) unsweetened shredded coconut to 1 cup (250 mL) whipping cream,table cream or milk and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before using.\nEggs\nFor 1 egg, substitute 3 tbsp (45 mL) of any type of cream, 3 tbsp (45 mL) all-purpose flour and 1/2 tsp (2 mL) baking powder. Whisk them together and add to the batter.\nAdapted from Dairy Farmers of Canada\nNutrition\nDairy products like milk, cheese and yogurt are an important part of the diet because they provide up to 16 essential nutrients including calcium, protein and vitamin D.\nCalcium\nCalcium is crucial to maintain life. Just about every cell in the body, including cells in the heart, nerves and muscles, relies on calcium to function properly. Calcium is also in our teeth, but most is stored in bone which makes our skeleton strong. The body is not able to make calcium so we have to get it from food. To keep our bones at their best, it is important to consume enough calcium to meet the body\u2019s needs.\nThe best sources:\nIt is best to consume as much of the calcium you need each day from food sources \u2013 they provide many additional nutrients to support good health. Osteoporosis Canada states that dairy products such as milk, cheese and yogurt are excellent sources of calcium. They contain large amounts of calcium that are easily absorbed by the body. Many vegetables, fruits, nuts, and legumes also contain calcium, but in much smaller amounts or in a form that our bodies cannot easily absorb.\nAre you getting enough calcium? To find out visit: Calcium Counter\nProtein\nProtein is a nutrient that is necessary for building and repairing body tissue. In addition to calcium and other minerals, bone is made up of a protein called collagen, which provides the bone with strength and flexibility. Muscles are also made of protein which builds muscle fibres. Dairy products, like milk, cheese, and yogurt, are a good source of protein needed to build and maintain muscle and bone.\nVitamin D\nVitamin D is essential for the absorption of calcium. Vitamin D can be produced by our skin in sunlight, but this is not a reliable way to get enough. There are very few food sources of Vitamin D. Milk is fortified with vitamin D (100 IU/cup [250 mL]). To meet daily recommendations Osteoporosis Canada recommends routine supplementation for all Canadian adults year round.\nFor more information on Vitamin D and daily recommendations visit Osteoposrisis Canada\nLocal Foods\n"}, {"score": 266.44202, "uuid": "847715c1-0e8a-5cea-9842-46dc55479d9e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1102wb-64-19148", "target_hostname": "blog.foodnetwork.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2009/09/01/milk-good-or-bad/", "page_rank": 1.1766474e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Milk: Good or Bad? | Healthy Eats &ndash; Food Network Healthy Living Blog", "snippet": "So many people that shop at our dairy are lactose intolerant yet, the real raw milk, yoghurt, butter etc. <em>does</em> not bother them!!!

Many folks view milk as wholesome and healthy. Others, meanwhile, warn us away and say it\u2019s full of hormones or might make you phlegmy. So what\u2019s the deal with milk: does it do your body good or not?\nNutrition Basics\nThe healthy nutrients in milk speak for themselves \u2014 protein, calcium, vitamins A, D, B12 and riboflavin and the mineral potassium. Sure, you can get these nutrients from other foods and beverages, but milk offers them all in one package. Plus, vitamin D, which helps you absorb calcium, is harder to come by in other foods, and recent studies have shown that many people (especially children) aren\u2019t getting enough.\nIf you\u2019re eating the skim variety (a.k.a. non-fat milk), it contains only 90 calories and 8 grams of protein and provides 30% of your daily calcium and 25% of your daily vitamin D. Of all the milk varieties, whole milk is the highest in fat and calories (146 calories and 8 grams of fat); reduced fat (a.k.a. 2%) and low-fat (a.k.a. 1%) have less. Most health pros recommend that adults and kids older than two stick with skim or 1% to avoid the extra calories, cholesterol and saturated fat.\nThe Hormone Issue\nMany milk naysayers worry most about the unnecessary hormones. Cows naturally produce the hormone bST to stimulate milk production. Some dairy farmers rely on a synthetic form of this hormone, rBST, to boost their cows\u2019 milk generation. Many health and food safety advocates question whether these extra hormones disrupt our own healthy hormone levels and, in turn, might lead to cancer or other medical problems. Some countries have banned farmers from using rbST on their cows, but other agencies, including the World Health Organization, say that rbST is safe. Here in the U.S. it\u2019s still allowed. If you\u2019re worried, the best thing to do is only buy milk that\u2019s rBST-free (it will say on the label) or organic.\nOrganic or Conventional?\nWhen a milk is labeled organic, it means that the dairy cows spend at least half the year out on pastures (so they can eat plenty of grass) and there\u2019s no use of synthetic hormones (like rbST). Today, 3% of the milk in America is organic, which is on the rise from years past. Most major supermarkets carry some kind of organic milk, but the price tag is often higher.\nThere\u2019s been a lot of debate lately about whether organic food is any better for you. Some research supports the theory that organic milk contains more nutrients and antioxidants like vitamin A, lutein and omega-3 fats , but there\u2019s nothing conclusive yet.\nWhen shopping for organic, local milk is another option to consider. Many smaller farms may not spend the time and money required to get certified \u201corganic\u201d but do follow organic practices. Local milk can be hard to find sometimes. In Connecticut, where I live, a few small dairy farms have joined forces to provide their milk to large chain grocery stores; check out the Connecticut Farmer\u2019s Cow website . Keep an eye on your dairy case and you might see some more local options. If you do, you can always call them up to ask if they follow organic practices.\nWhat About Raw?\nNearly all the milk sold today (95% to be exact) is pasteurized, which means the milk was quickly heated to just over 160-degrees to kill off any harmful bacteria. Pasteurization also lengthens shelf life and freshness. (TIP: Always check the sell-by dates at the store; many markets push the older milk to the front to sell it before it expires.)\nRaw milk, meanwhile, is just that: raw and unpasteurized. Advocates claim that not pasteurizing means better flavor and nutrient quality. There\u2019s strong evidence to show that pasteurization doesn\u2019t actually affect your milk\u2019s protein, vitamin or mineral content, and the FDA and CDC actually warn the elderly, young children, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems to avoid raw milk because of the bacteria risk.\nOther Milk Concerns\nThere are countless theories that blame everything from acne to bed-wetting on drinking milk. Here are some of the things I\u2019m asked about most.\nLactose Intolerance: Some people can\u2019t digest the lactose in milk (lactose is a natural sugar) because they don\u2019t have a certain enzyme you need to break it down. If that\u2019s you, look for lactose-free dairy products; they\u2019re available in most stores and contain all the same nutrients as regular milk. You may find that you can tolerate small amounts of dairy without a problem. Since every case is different, be sure to check with your doctor and registered dietitian to make choices that work for you.\nAcne: Have you ever heard that drinking milk makes you break out? Well, a few studies have found that it\u2019s possible. Researchers think it\u2019s the hormones in milk that cause flare-ups in people with acne-prone skin, but there\u2019s no solid association yet. If you\u2019re battling acne, you may want to experiment by limiting the dairy you eat to see if there is a benefit (be sure get milk\u2019s nutrients from other sources while you\u2019re at it).\nMucus and Asthma: Some folks blame milk for increasing mucus production in the nose and throat and possibly worsening asthma symptoms. Yes, I\u2019ve heard people complain that they\u2019re nagged with extra phlegm or a cough after eating a lot of cheese or drinking milk. So far, however, there are no research studies that prove the relationship between dairy and mucus or asthma.\nThe Bottom Line\nCow\u2019s milk can certainly be part of a healthy diet, and all types contain important nutrients like protein, calcium and vitamin D. Most complaints against milk relate to the potential side effects from added hormones. If this concerns you, buy hormone-free or organic milk (which doesn\u2019t contain added hormones either). If you skip milk because you\u2019re lactose intolerant or avoid animal products, make sure to get nutrients like calcium and vitamin D from your other foods.\nMore Healthy Eats articles that feature milk:\n"}, {"score": 262.39322, "uuid": "422aab97-74c8-57ca-8cd2-a4cdfcde93df", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-18-03749", "target_hostname": "www.varasanos.com", "target_uri": "http://www.varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm", "page_rank": 2.660337e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Jeff Varasano's NY Pizza Recipe", "snippet": "Also, note that all fresh dairy products sold in the US are made from <em>pasteurized</em> milk, whereas the European versions are often <em>unpasteurized</em>.

I don't think they are easy to find though.\nOthers praise these, but I have not tried them:\nStanislaus\nI know that Patsy's buys from Sassone in the Bronx (where I grew up). But I haven't tried a case yet. They may be repackaging any number of brands.\nEveryone vouches for Escalon, but I dislike them.\u00a0 The Escalon are round tomatoes, whereas most of the Italian brands are Plum tomatoes, which I strongly prefer. I also prefer the plain Cento Italian over the\u00a0 Cento DOP Certified San Marzano.\nHere are my\u00a0 Prep tips:\nAlways buy Whole Peeled Plum Tomatoes and crush them yourself.\nBe careful of marketing tricks like cans that say Italian 'Style' instead of Italian. Italian Style means nothing. It's subjective. If I grew tomatoes in Chernobyl I could still claim they are Italian Style.\nSimilarly there's a San Marzano 'Brand' which is grown in CA. I hate marketing gimmicks like that. The put the word 'brand' so small that you can barely read it.\nShake every can as you buy it. If it sounds watery, it is likely to be more bitter. Try to get cans which sound more viscous.\u00a0 The sound will vary a bit by season. They try to pick and pack in just one season, but still there are seasonal differences even within the same brand.\nIf you have a local tomato supplier, try those too.\nOne time I bought a jar of tomatoes at a farmers market - no can. These were hand packed and they had no tin can taste. They were excellent but all the major suppliers use cans.\u00a0 Be on the lookout for jars someday...\nIf you want to go crazy and make your own, try 'ugly ripe' heirloom tomatoes. The taste of these are amazing and I use these when I need whole tomatoes.\nWhen I open a can I taste it. Every can is a little different. About 10% of the cans I just throw out because they are too bitter and I put too much effort in the dough to waste it on a $2 can of bad tomatoes.\nDON'T make a sauce. That is, don't pre-cook the tomatoes. The tomatoes will cook on the pizza.\u00a0 If you cook a sauce first, it will cook again on the psizza, turning it brown and yucky.\u00a0 No need to make a sauce.\u00a0 Look at how overcooked many sauces are. The best places don't do this. This is actually the one step\u00a0 in this whole process that you can save yourself some time.\nI strain the seeds. This is really optional. If you do choose to do it, follow these steps, which seem obvious now, but took me a long time to flesh out:\nPour the can out into a bowl\nCut the green/yellow stem ends off the tomatoes with your hands or a paring knife, then discard.\nSqueeze out the seeds into the puree and then Dip the tomato into the puree. You can even cut the tomato open to get out any remaining seeds, by essentially rinsing them with the puree.\u00a0 This will have all the seeds fall into the puree.\nPut the flesh back in the can\nAt the end of this process you have a can of flesh and a bowl of watery puree and seeds. Strain this, pouring the puree back into the can.\u00a0 In the strainer are then 90% of the seeds, all by themselves. Discard the seeds.\nNow crush the tomatoes. This is one of those areas where I made a recent change for the better and it's really helped a lot. I used to crush the tomatoes by hand. But it was always a bit chunky. Now I blend them with an\u00a0 immersion mixer (\"boat motor\"). I cannot tell you exactly why this has made a huge improvement\u00a0 in the TASTE of the tomatoes, but it has. I've done side by side taste tests. The tomatoes should be crushed but not pur ed. Go Easy. I have nothing against using a food processor or mill, but I will say that you should not crush by hand.\nTomato Rinsing: All cans have some bitterness. You need some bitterness and you don't want to strip all of it out. But if the can is too bitter it's not good. I have a procedure I call tomato rinsing to remove some of the bitterness. But you have to taste the can and determine for yourself if it needs it. The better brands on my list don't.\u00a0 Here's the Tomato Rinsing procedure: Strain the tomatoes in a fine mesh strainer..\u00a0 If the mesh is fine, the water will be mostly clear with very little tomato escaping. If the water escaping is very red, pour it back on top of the tomatoes and continue straining. Eventually the water will run almost completely clear.\u00a0 Here's the key. The water that comes out is completely bitter. Taste it.\u00a0 What I do is pour fresh water on top of the strained tomatoes and strain them again. Taste this second batch of water.\u00a0 It's also bitter but less so. You are removing bitterness and acid without losing a drop of red tomato. Instead you are replacing this bitter water with fresh water. You can repeat this several times if you like, but once or twice is usually fine. The net result is that what is left over, which is all the red tomato solids, is sooooo sweet and yummy.\nHere are some other things you can do to remove the bitterness. But don't go crazy adding tons of spices and things. It's mostly just tomatoes.\nAdd some grated Romano cheese directly into the tomatoes.\u00a0 I use Locatelli Romano. Some have criticized this, but I like it.\nA bit of sugar will also help 1/4 - 1 teaspoon.\u00a0 Taste and see.\nA pinch of salt\nA pinch of dried oregano, crushed by hand to release the oils\nIf you are used to putting garlic in your sauce, try these steps once without it.\nTaste and taste\nSo you are removing and then adding back water. In the end though you should have less water than you started with. The total weight is probably about 1/3 less than you started with. But the exact amount of water you remove depends on the overall temperature of the oven and the temperature differential in the oven.. There is not much time in a hot oven to evaporate the sauce, so the hotter the oven, the drier the sauce must be going in.\u00a0 But if the top differential is high, the sauce will evaporate too quickly and needs to start wetter. You have to test. Surprisingly, if the sauce is too dry, it's not as sweet. You don't want it soupy but don't overstrain either. This will take real practice with your oven. Sometimes after the first pie I add more water to my sauce. Again, this is another area where recent improvements have really transformed the sauce. I think that when the sauce is chunky (hand crushed) it's harder to get the amount of water right.\nHere's the strainer and Immersion mixer I use:\nAlso, while straining, you are letting\u00a0 the crushed tomatoes sit uncovered and this really helps the tin can taste to dissipate. Prep the tomatoes when you make the dough. Even though you are not adding too much to your sauce, the tomatoes do better when the flavors settle in for a day and also the tin can taste dissipates. So prep a day or more\u00a0 in advance. Again, this is another recent change that has helped a lot.\nRefrigerate the tomatoes if you are not using them, but let them come to room temp when put on the pie. If the sauce is cold, the top of the dough is much colder than then bottom and you can end up with a thin layer of dough near the sauce that is gummier and less cooked than the rest of the dough.\nWhen you spread the sauce on the pie, put a little less in the center because the liquid tends to pool there.\nIf you are using a very hot oven like I am, don't go too close to the edge. Too much sauce near the edge will keep the cornice from developing well. In most of the photos below I put the sauce too close to the edge myself. I will be more conscious of this as I go.\nUse about half of the sauce that you think you need.\u00a0 Trust me. Experiment with less and less ingredients on the pizza and you will see a surprising improvement in overall balance.\nUsing Fresh Tomato\nAn alternative to canned tomatoes is fresh tomatoes. Even the best cans have a tinny odor, so you'd think that nothing could top fresh tomatoes. But using 100% fresh tomatoes is not necessarily the best thing. If you prepare fresh tomatoes and taste it raw, compared to canned, the fresh will win. But somehow, on the pizza, the canned will win. Partly it's that the fresh tomato taste is simply different than we are all used to and so it never tastes like your favorite pizza place.\u00a0 I've probably not experimented enough to say for sure. As I stated above, I don't recommend cooking your sauce before making a pizza, because the tomatoes will cook again on the pizza. If you think about it, the canning process itself forces the tomatoes to be heated once before sealing, then if you cook a sauce, that's heating #2 and then the pie is #3. So I recommend cutting back to 2 times. If you switch to fresh tomatoes though, you are back to just 1 time, on the pie itself. And for a 2 minute pie, that is not very much. So perhaps a solution, if you are using fresh tomatoes, is to cook a sauce. I will experiment a little more and edit this section.\nAnother possibility is to blend fresh and canned. This has a lot of potential, I think and I will experiment with this more also.\nHere's a method for preparing fresh tomatoes:\nStart with great tomatoes. I use \"ugly ripe\" heirloom tomatoes. These are the best to me. FYI, they are really amazing raw for a caprese salad (tomato, Mozz, basil, oil, balsamic, salt, pepper). Other heirlooms are probably good also, as are fresh picked local tomatoes. After that I'd probably go for plum tomatoes. I'm not a huge fan of the vine-ripe brand. They look great, but the taste is so-so. Regular beefsteak tomatoes are really not worth the effort.\nBlanch them. Blanching is a pretty easy technique. You just put the tomato in boiling water for 30 seconds or less, then take it out and put it in ice water for 30 seconds, then you can just peel it by hand.\nCored them with a paring knife and pull out most of the seeds by hand.\nGround them a bit with an\u00a0 immersion mixer\nStrained them. They were very, very wet and will lose a lot of weight in water.\nAdded a tiny amount of sea salt and a few fresh basil leaves from the garden and that's about it.\nCook them? As I said, this is my next experiment.\nAfter straining I figure that it would take about 3.5 lbs of tomatoes to equal one 35 oz can.\u00a0 Since Ugly Ripes are twice the price of any other tomatoes (they are VERY tasty) - $5.99/lb, this makes it over $20 for a small batch about equal to a $1.89 can. But who's counting...\n9- Grate some Locatelli Romano and/or parmessian cheese right on top of the tomatoes & basil\u00a0(do this whether you put some romano into the tomatoes or not).\u00a0 But don't over do it.\u00a0 Just a TINY little bit. But don't skip this step. It's really key to the sauce. Balance, balance, balance.\n10- Sprinkle kosher or sea salt\n11- Fresh Mozzarella.\u00a0 I live in Atlanta, and getting good cheese is a real problem. It's the weakest link in my pie right now. In NYC all the mozzarella is packed in water, but it is still firm.\u00a0 Down here in Atlanta, I can't find great fresh mozz. It's either dry cheese or else water logged.\u00a0 If the cheese is too wet, it will break down on the pizza and even disintegrate into ricotta.\u00a0 Ricotta is made by processing the leftover water used to make mozzarella.\u00a0 If the mozz is not made right, it will actually break down into ricotta before your eyes.\u00a0 Not good. You can see this in some of my photos.\nIn Naples they use Bufala Mozzarella which is made from water buffalo instead of cows. The problem with using Bufala Mozz here in the US is that it's mostly\u00a0 imported and usually not that fresh, especially during the summer. If you can find a good supplier, then use it. Also, note that all fresh dairy products sold in the US are made from pasteurized milk, whereas the European versions are often unpasteurized. If you've ever had butter or cheese in Paris, for example, you know that what we get here is bland in comparison. So reproducing what you tasted on your trip to Italy is difficult. There are a few American suppliers of Bufula Mozz including http://www.starhilldairy.com/prod_mozzarella.shtml which is available at many Whole Foods.\nPut only about 8-10 small pieces of cheese on the pie.\u00a0 Better to have a few dollops than an even mix. Trust me on this one too. If you find, as I did, that the cheese will not hold up to the intense heat and breaks down, there are few things you can do to keep the cheese from overheating on the pie prematurely:\nDry the cheese extremely well by wrapping in a paper towel for 1-3 hours. You'd think the wetter it is the better it would hold up to the heat, but its not so. The water inside boils and degrades the cheese. Sometimes the cheese is so wet I have to change the wrapping several times. This might be avoided by simply draining for a long long time. I think Marco says he drains for 8 hours.\nPut the cheese on in cubes rather than slices\nStart with cold cheese\nPut a tiny drop of sauce on them which has to boil off first, thus keeping the cheese insulated for a bit.\nDoing all of these may be overkill. You have to experiment with your cheese.\nMany cheeses packed in water are unsalted. If this is so, put in 1/4 teaspoon of kosher or sea salt in the water, preferably at least a day before you use it. Don't over salt the cheese, as this may cause some inferior cheeses to break down somewhat.\nIf you can't find a cheese locally, these are some suppliers that ship fresh mozz.. It's pricey to do it this way though:\nhttp://www.mozzny.com/ - Pretty good but not the best NY has to offer. They shipped them in a cold pack box and they came very fresh. If you don't have a local supplier, this is definitely a viable but expense choice.\nhttp://www.mozzco.com/ - I've not tried it, but these guys look very serious about their craft. Even more expensive than the previous one.\nMaking your own cheese\nAnother alternative is to make your own cheese. I'm no expert on this, so I'm going to refer you to other internet sources. But I'm going to give a super basic primer.\nGood sources of info.\nLeeners - I would start here.\nCheesemaking.com - this is an easy kit, but missing a few things.\nGoogle other recipes. There's a lot to learn.\nSome basics:\nMilk\nDo not use ultra-pasteurized dairy products. The ultra-pasteurization changes the structure and it won't curdle any more. Unfortunately, some states are allowing companies to remove the term 'ultra' and they are passing off ultra-pasteurized as just pasteurized. So be careful.\nStart with unhomogenized milk. You probably have to go to a farmers market or dairy for this. It should be about $6-$8 per gallon, which makes about 1 pound or a little more of cheese. When an animal is milked, it comes out as cream and skim and the process of homogenization blends them together. It's like shaking oil and vinegar, but the shake is so fine, it never settles out again. So an alternative to unhomogenized is to use cream and skim together. But most creams have been ultra-pasteurized, so you have to find one that is not.\nHow many water buffalo do you own? Well if you have them, use them, otherwise, find a cow. Water buffalo milk has more fat, so one experiment worth trying is to add more cream to your cow's milk.\nAcidify the milk. Milk will curdle best at a ph level of about 5.2. From my experience, using a ph test kit or digital ph meter is essential\nCitric Acid - the easy way. You measure the acid and blend it in and presto, it's acidic. But if you measure wrong, you are going to be unhappy with it. Note than many measuring spoon sets are not that accurate. 2 of my 1/2 teaspoons don't really equal one of my teaspoons, I discovered. There went 3 hours of my life I'll never get back. If you put in too much it will curdle but never form a ball and be stretchable. I've had the best results (nothing to write home about yet), using only 1.25 teaspoons per gallon of milk, which is much less than most recipes call for.\nUse a starter culture, just like you do for the dough. The culture eats the milk and make acid. It takes many hours though. Of course, this is the more authentic and flavorful method, but as with all these steps, more work. There are a lot of different cultures that can be used to vary the taste of cheese. Some recipes even just say start with buttermilk or yogurt. But for Mozzarella, the most authentic type is called Thermophilic , but even this seems to be a category and there are several varieties sold under that name. Just like with the yeast, there is a dry instant culture you just toss in and a wet, keep-feeding-it-forever variety.\nAdditives. These are all optional:\nItalian Mild Lipase Powder - an enzyme\nOther flavoring cultures. These are Lactobacilli that produce flavor but no acid. This mirrors the whole yeast/Lactobacilli combination we talked about with the dough. The yeast and Thermophilic organisms are doing the critical jobs of starting bubbles and changing the acid level. But the optional Lactobacilli are doing the flavoring.\nCalcium Chloride - helps to restore the balance between calcium and protein in store bought milk.\u00a0 It may also be needed with fresh milk. I've only seen this in the Leeners recipe.\nRennet - Once the milk is acidic and heated to about 88F, you add an enzyme called rennet and it curdles in just a few minutes\nVegetable or animal. Rennet originally came from the lining of an animal's stomach, but most companies sell vegetable rennet.\nTablet or liquid.\nFlaked Salt\nThermometer. These kits all use a hand held thermometer, but I prefer to use a digital meat thermometer, because you can just dip it over the side and get continuous readings.\npH Test kit or digital meter.\nOnce you've added the rennet, the milk curdles in a few minutes - it separates into chunky curdles and water whey.\u00a0 They you have to cut it to strain the whey out of the curds and then heat it by either microwaving it or pouring hot water (or whey) on it. I recommend the hot liquid because it gives more of a continuous heat, rather than the microwave method which has you heat it, then work it, then heat it again, etc.\nBe careful not to overwork the cheese or take out too much whey. Then you will end up pulling out all the fat and end up with a dry waxy cheese, like a Polly-O consistency. Watch this guy do it . He is starting with store-bought curd. It's a dark murky video, but worth watching.\n12- More salt\n13- Olive Oil - This is optional. In Naples they will typically put on a good olive oil. Many oils do not stand up well to these high temperatures. I had one pie at Una Pizza Napoletana in NYC with a very fruity oil from Calabria that was outstanding, even at the high temps. But I don't have the brand. The one's I've tried I can't recommend.\n14- Assembly - From the time the sauce hits the dough, the dough is starting to water log. Water logged dough will not rise. This is actually an area that I still need to work on myself. Look at this picture from last night. The rise on the crust is outstanding. but under the sauce the dough has not risen well. In fact it's a bit gummy. The reason is that after I sauced the dough, I took a long time to get it into the oven. Once the sauce touches the dough, the pie should go into the oven seconds later. Have your ingredients laid out so that you can sauce the dough, throw on the other ingredients and get it into the oven immediately.\n15- Into the oven for 2-3 minutes. There is a lot of talk about time and temp. Really, time is a better measure than temp. Ovens vary in temp from spot to spot and even 2 stones that have the same surface temp may have a different depth to that heat and that will really play out and affect the time. Ultimately, time is a better measure. There is a lot of debate online about how long it takes to bake a \"true\" Neapolitan pie. It started off as 2 minutes, then it went to 90 seconds, then 60, then 45 and recently 30 seconds. Some of this is a \"boys and their toys\" thing.\u00a0 Instead of arguing about horsepower people are arguing about oven temp.\u00a0 Chill out. It is true that in Naples, the pies cook very, very fast, usually in under 90 seconds.\u00a0 If your goal is a true reproduction of the Neapolitan style, then you may want to aim for this. But that is not the only style of tasty pizza. A pie that's cooked in 30 seconds is not necessarily better than one cooked in 150. The faster it cooks the less crispy and more airy it is. But this is only good to a point. Some dough that are cooked super fast have a burnt bitter outside and are raw inside.\u00a0 It takes a lot of practice to get it all right. Believe me, a 2-3 minute pie is going to be great if you follow these steps. My best pies were 2:10 - 2:30.\u00a0 Maybe it will get even better as I go down in time, but I'm skeptical of the 30 second pies.\u00a0 Patsy's makes a GREAT pie in about 4 minutes. Sally's, makes a great pie in 7. I've timed pies at Luzzo's in NYC at 1:55 and at Una Pizza Napoletana at 2:10. These are all notch places with great pies and crust. There's no question that a hot oven is important - you are not going to get a light airy crust with 10 minute pie. But once you are sub-5 minutes, you are easily in the range to make a great tasting pie, provided your dough formulation is correct.\nIf you are having problems with your pie burning on the bottom in a very hot oven, increase the hydration of the dough. Wetter dough burns less. But also, you may have to adjust the balance of temperature (top vs. bottom)\u00a0 in your oven using aluminum foil. See the section above regarding the oven.\n16- Remove from oven with a peel.\u00a0 When a pie cooks at these high temps, you may find that it is soggier than you are used to. In Naples, the pies are pretty wet and you cut them with a knife and fork and eat them on a plate. There are a few things you can do to lessen the moisture. Use less sauce and drain it well.\u00a0 But also, I put my pies on a rack when they come out so that any steam that is coming out of the bottom can escape. Just a 2-3 minutes on the screen then onto the metal round where they are cut.\u00a0 Don't cut too quickly. The flavors need to settle and they will be more distinct with a cooler pie.\u00a0 If you don't have a rack,\u00a0 you may find it helpful to transfer the pizza back and forth between the peel and the metal round, to allow the steam to escape from the bottom of the pie.\u00a0 Make sure you dry off the metal round between pies so that moisture doesn t build.\nWith High temp pies, there is the possibility of it being a little soggy in the middle especially if you are using a lower protein flour, such as a 00 flour. Brick ovens are very good at sucking moisture out of the dough very quickly. The environment is very, very dry. One downside of an electric, even one at 800F, is that the moisture tends to pool. One easy solution is to remove the pie from the oven and place it on a perforated metal round such as this one. I place this on my stovetop so that the bottom is exposed, allowing moisture to evaporate for about a minute. Then I move to a regular serving round.\u00a0 I've seen several 'modern' brick ovens that are gas fired. Burning gas creates moisture and ruins much of the effect of the brick oven. Brick ovens should burn wood or coal.\n17 -Season with oregano, red pepper flakes, black pepper and maybe a drop of olive oil (depending on how wet it already is).\n18- Cut and serve\nGood luck, but be prepared for a lot of trial and error.\nThis is a pretty good idea of what you will see if your oven is hot enough\nExcept for a minor malfunction of the fresh mozz, this is a pretty awesome pie. The new cheese instructions given above have since solved this problem.\u00a0 You can see that the dry cheese underneath bubbled and charred a bit. It was good, but I don't use dry cheese anymore.\u00a0 I will cut some cross sections next time to you can see how light the crust is inside. This pie used hand crushed tomatoes which I think are too chunky.\nThe spring back on the crust is excellent. The holes are big and the crust is light and soft. But this crust was too thin in the middle. Each pie is a learning experience. This pie had no dry cheese, just fresh mozz\nSprings right back after squeezing. Notice that the tomatoes were crushed by hand and are chunky. I recommend blending them with an immersion mixer or food processor instead.\nMore perfect charring\nThis pie was awesome. Overall it's probably the best I've ever made. The dough was in the fridge for 6 days. When I took the dough out of the sealed container, it had the aroma of a fine wine. I bet it could have gone another few days without a problem. You can see from the color that I used fresh mozzarella from 2 different batches. Both were excellent though. The cheese breakdown problem has been solved. No dry cheese underneath on this one.\nThis pie was made with KA Sir Lancelot (KASL high gluten flour) rather than my normal KA Bread Flour.\u00a0 The difference was pretty nominal. Flour is important but technique is more critical.\u00a0 The lesson of this pie is that the sauce should be a little thinner in the middle than anywhere else. Can you see it pooling towards the middle. Another lesson of this pie is that I need a better camera. My Sony CyberShot is small and chic, but takes mediocre close-up photos.\nNext KASL from the same batch. This was an excellent pie all around. It was comparable to the last bread flour batch that rose for 3 days, but not as good as the one that was 6 days old. That one was amazing. This pie was among the first with machine crushed tomatoes, rather than hand crushed. It was a huge improvement.\nThis cross section shows the bread structure. See the holes. They are pretty big and the dough is springy.\nThese cross sections are pretty good. The crust is well defined and high. While the bubbles are big they are not as pronounced as they could be. The likely cause: this dough over rose slightly.\u00a0 The big winner here was the sauce. This was among the first pies with the new sauce technique and it's really an improvement.\nSame pie on the bottom. Perhaps too charred, but good.\nThis pie was a 6 day cold rise Caputo Pizzeria 00 with 56% hydration. Caputo dough seem to absorb much more flour. I tried a pie with a 3 day cold rise also. I know that everyone is raving about the Caputo. Frankly, I hardly noticed the difference. Nothing wrong with it.\u00a0 But I wouldn't go crazy trying to hunt it down.\u00a0 In the last 4 months, mostly to deal with claims on the net, I've tried KA AP, KA Bread, KASL and now Caputo. I'm right back where I started from. Specialty flour is not a huge factor in this process. It's like when you see people arguing about the relative merits of 2 different tensions pulls on $1,000 tennis rackets, meanwhile they go out and miss the ball by 8 feet. Forget it. Maybe if you are making pies at the 99.8th percentile and you want to move to the 99.9th, then you should be worrying about this. Otherwise, let it go. Work on the BIG 3 factors: high heat, a good sourdough starter and technique (mixing and fermenting). This is where you will move from the 50th percentile to the 99th. Then worry about the relative merits of the type of milling or exact mineral breakdown of sea salt from one bay to the next. As in everything, work on the fundamentals.\nThis pie had excellent bubbles and spring. Another dough from the same batch rose 20 minutes less and was cooked at 725 (vs. 800 for the pie shown) and was dense with few holes.\u00a0 Technique, timing, heat - that's the ball game.\u00a0 Way down the list is the flour.\nMarch 2006\nThis dough was a 4 day cold rise using a blend of KA Bread, KASL and Caputo.\u00a0 Very wet dough. The big thing here was that I used my Kitchen Aid mixer instead of my DLX. While the DLX is far the superior machine, I now have a lot more experience with technique using a wet-knead. The result: the dough was just as good in the KA as it was with the DLX. The DLX is capable of mixing much larger batches and is easier to use, but for 4 pies or less, and with the wet-knead technique, I can now say that the KA dough is just as good.\nBoth pies were exactly a 2:30 at just over 800F. I've learned that the higher the hydration, the better it stands up to high heat. Dry dough will burn at high heat, but wet dough chars nicely.\u00a0 The cornice is not as well defined as it could have been, but the crust was super soft and tasty. These pies were as close to Patsy's as I've come. These were among my very best.\u00a0 They were amazing.\u00a0 The flavor, the texture, the sauce were incredible. But they were not quite as 'Neapolitan' as some are striving for.\u00a0 These were more NY.\nComparing Cheeses. Obtaining fresh Bufala Mozzarella can be difficult.\u00a0 The first pie is with Bufala Mozzarella but it's not as fresh as I'd have liked. The second is with cows milk. You can see that they melt differently. These pies were a blend of Caputo and KA Bread, baked at 840F for exactly 2 minutes each.\nThe charring on both pies was excellent.\nThis is one of my\u00a0 first attempts at making my own Mozzarella Cheese. It's just unhomogenized milk, citric acid, rennet and salt. Actually this pie had homemade dough, cheese and sauce. The sauce was from peeling ugly ripe tomatoes and reducing them. You can see the cheese burned a little bit.\u00a0 But it tasted pretty good. I have a long ways to go in the cheese making department...\nIf you use too much bench flour at these high temps you will find that the residual flour is bitter. But if you use too little you may find it hard to get the pie off the peel, especially since I am using a very wet dough. This takes some practice. If you can't slide the pie off the peel, you may have a mini disaster. A last resort way to recover is to fold the pie over into a calzone. This rustic looking calzone was the result of a trainee who forgot to flour the board at all. But no one complained. It was very tasty. The small amount of sauce on top will keep the top from burning as it puffs up closer to the heating element. I learned this trick from Luzzo's in NYC. If the ingredients inside the calzone are relatively dry (such as ricotta, mozz & ham), then the calzone is best if sealed. If the ingredients are wet, such as with this folded over tomato sauce, mozz pizza, then you may want to pop a small hole in the top to allow the steam to escape. Otherwise you may find the result in water logged inside.\nThis calzone was more planned. It's one of my favorite combinations: Rosemary, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh chopped tomatoes, mozz and pepperoni.\nThis is mostly for show - My current dough recipe doesn't really spin that well\nI Think this one had mushrooms on it. I'm going to post a section soon with other toppings, like my clam pie and my onion pie. But margarita pie is still the classic by which pies are judged\nThis pie was made with regular old White Lily flour you can find in any supermarket. It did behave and feel a little different - it had a heavier, gummier feel when kneading. But once you have experience you can compensate for these things.\u00a0 My guests did not notice the difference and said it tasted the same as the King Arthur.\nThe bubbles and spring were comparable to the King Arthur, but not as much as the Caputo\nA classic Marinara Pie - Garlic Oregano, parmesan and olive oil, also using White Lily Flour\nThe quality of the ingredients is very important. I have scoured the lands, trying every brand of flour, tomato and cheese I could find. I've had cheese flown in, paying $75 for enough cheese for just one round of pies, I've even made my own cheese from scratch, starting with just milk. I've tasted every brand of tomato I could find and peeled and blanched my own from local tomato growers. And theses things do make a difference. But there's just no getting around the simple truth of 'the big three' - High heat, good natural yeast, and mixing technique. Getting these right will cover a lot of sins and getting these wrong will screw up the best ingredients.\u00a0 Witness the crust on this pie made with cheap old White Lily flour.\nThis pie is Caramelized Onions with Emmenthaler Cheese. This combo goes well with fresh Thyme\nThis pie was very interesting. I made a fresh dough and then took an old dough that had sat in my fridge for about 10 days, and blended them together. This tends to make a very sour - sourdough. Not in a bad way, just very well developed and rich. Typically, if you do this, the dough will not have the lightest structure, but will be a little flatter and chewier. Again, not necessarily bad, but different.\u00a0 Still, some of my guests said this was one of my best ever.\u00a0 Also, I cut the cheese in cubes instead of slices and you can see the effect. It's similar to what Luzzo's did in the very next photo. Finally, this pie had a LOT of extra virgin olive oil on it. I often put none, but after trying Una Pizza Napoletana's pie, I gave it a try with a lot of oil. I think if I try this again I will go much lower on the sauce to compensate. This pie was also a little lower temp. Probably around a 3:00 or 3:15 pie.\nThis is my Sicilian Pizza, based on my grandmother's style that she made when I was a kid, except with a well fermented sourdough crust. I wish\u00a0 you could have tasted this one. Wow, it was tasty. I made this with a sourdough culture given to me by a fan of this site.\nThis pie is from Luzzo's on 1st Ave and 12th Street in\u00a0 NYC. Great place. I timed this at 1:55. The taste of the crust was virtually identical to mine. Notice how the cheese was put on in cubes and allowed to melt.\nThis pie is from Una Pizza Napoletana, just a block from Luzzo's in NYC. Another great place. I timed this at 2:10. The taste of the crust was also very similar to mine, but more mild, less sourdough. It's texture was definitely softer than mine. Anthony used all caputo flour, but also uses other 00 flours at times. This pie uses fresh Bufala Mozzarella which was very wet. You can see how it kind of melts and puddles in the middle. This is not what most are used to, but very common in Naples.\u00a0 The really obvious thing about this pie was that it had very little sauce and a lot of fruity olive oil which held up very well despite the heat. He said it was from Calabria but had no brand since it was provided by a friend who grows there. I prefer more sauce, but the olive taste was very very nice too.\nThis pie is from Da Michelle, which is considered one of the best in Naples. The is the authentic target.\nThis is Trianon in Naples, which is also one of the best\nDenino's - the best pizza on Staten Island. This is a similar style to Modern in New Haven. Wow.

No other town I've been in makes this kind of pizza.\u00a0 The pie below is half Marinara and half cheese. My photo of Modern Apizza, a few miles away, didn't come out that good. But Modern is even better than Sally's in my opinion.\nFranny's in Brooklyn. An amazing pizza.\nStyles of Pizza\nTo be added...\nThe World's Best Pizzerias\nSliceNY has comprehensive listings, photos and reviews of hundreds of restaurants.\u00a0 In this article, I'm primarily interested in highlighting the very best places.\u00a0 Many of the best places are the ones that have stood the test of time. These are the 'old school pizzerias founded from 1905-1955. This article in SliceNY gives a good timeline that shows when some of these places opened. You will see that a good number of today's best places are spin-offs from just a few of the originals. But pizza is undergoing a revival. In the last 10 years, especially the last 5, a wave of excellent 'new school' pizzerias have opened. There are a few exceptions, but overwhelmingly the best places are either 'old school' or 'new school' with very few in between. During the 'Lost Years', 1960-1995, about all we got was junk like Domino's, Pizza Hut, CPK, etc. My quest began in 1998 with old school places like Patsy's.. But new places like Luzzo's have quickly risen to the top of a lot of lists.\nThere is an organization called Vera Pizza Napoletana (VPN) that certifies that pizzerias are making authentic Neapolitan pizza. Most of these places prominently post their VPN certification, with one even claiming their certification is \"an international award.\"\u00a0 However, no VPN pizzeria makes it into my top tier and several are among my bottom tier. Basically it's a marketing organization.\u00a0 You pay a few hundred bucks, you take a course and in a few days you are certified and can post a sign up that proves you are a great pizza maker. Yeah right.\u00a0 Personally, the certification means nothing to me. Certainly the best old school pizzerias don't bother with VPN.\nWhat makes a good pizza? I\u00a0 don't want to digress too far, but I used to teach a course on the topic of 'Mastery'. It's fascinating to me. There are a lot of similarities to the process of mastering things, regardless of the discipline. Whether it's the violin, karate, golf, finances, cooking - whatever- there are patterns which re-occur over and over. Understanding some of these patterns has definitely helped me improve my pizza tremendously. One pattern that you see is that you have to go through a long period where you learn lots of technique. However true masters have more than technical perfection and often violate 'the rules' of their discipline. Louis Armstrong and Frank Sinatra didn't hit every pitch or beat - they made up their own and it was better. True artistry has soul, not just technical perfection. In the Olympics, judges split the scores for technical merit and artistic impression. I know what they mean -\u00a0 Technically perfect can mean boring and lacking in character.\nI think that a lot of pizza bloggers are forgetting this. They are looking for technical perfection - how much spring is in the crust, how fast did it cook, how charred was it? I can understand that. But some are starting to sound more and more like wine connoisseurs, lost in the technical, and forgetting the total experience.\u00a0 Lots of people are ranking places high if they are \"authentically Neapolitan.\"\u00a0 This is not my standard. Ultimately I really try to rank things on how they taste. Sometimes there's a pie that's technically perfect but yet I would never remember it the next day. It's got all the check marks, but I'd never crave it. A16 in San Francisco is a good example - very high marks for looking and being an 'authentic' Neapolitan Pizza. But somehow it's just missing something. It has no soul to it.\u00a0 Johnny's, in contrast, may not have the 'oven spring' or other characteristics that many look for, but it's pretty much perfect. I go there looking to have 3 or 4 slices, but usually end up eating a whole pie of 8. No one at A16 is licking the plate like that.\nAs I've been to more and more pizzerias I've struggled with how to rank and classify them. People have been sending me recommendations and the list has grown a lot. I actually visited 95 pizzerias in 2007!!!\u00a0 I've decided to reorganize the rankings into 4 Tiers:\nTier 1 - These are the places that I highly recommend. These are worth the drive or even the flight.\nTier 2 - These are places that have a good reputation and have very good pizza but I can't quite recommend going out of your way for them. If you are in the area and are going on a pizza tour, you may want to include them. Technically, a lot of these places are good, but again, they are missing something. You can see my rankings for these places dip down into the 4's. I'm grading on a curve and with so many places to rank it was hard to space them. In Atlanta, these places would get 9's and Atlanta's current 'best' would be a 2.\nNotable - I've decided not to rank these. I list them but I don't give a number. Some of these places (Ben's for example) used to be great but now ride on their reputations only. Some are notable but not great. Take for Example, GoodFella's on Staten Island. It's the original unit that spawned the GoodFella's chain.\u00a0 I wanted to list it because a zillion people have told me to check it out and if you are a pizza nut like me you may want to pop in someday. But what can I really say about it. I can't really give it a number because it's really just an average NY pizza. I could walk through Brooklyn and pop into a random pizzeria and it's 50/50 that it may be better than GoodFella's. So short of listing every pizzeria in NY and ranking all of them, it's hard to rank GoodFella's. Yet it does get some buzz so I wanted to list it.\nNaples Pizzeria - I really really struggled with how to rank the pizzerias that I visited in Naples, Italy. I had 21 in all. I list the 10 that are well know below. The rest were mostly street pizzas. I decided in the end to list the Neapolitan Pizzerias separately. They are ranked in order with the best one, Gino Sorbillo at the top. However, the spread between the best and the worst was very tight. They were all remarkably similar and utterly unlike any American pizzeria. A few American places, like Zero Otto Nove, A Mano and Franny's are close in style, but given how consistent the real Neapolitan places were, it would be a mistake to put any of the American places in with them. The Neapolitan pizza is a definite style. When I returned I wrote up a 10 page report for a few friends on what I liked and didn't like about the style. I won't bore you with all of that. I'll just say this: it's an acquired taste. Most Americans would not fall down and say \"oh this is the best pizza I ever had\". At the same time, I now understand the snobbery of some of my Italian friends who say that what we make here is \"not really pizza\". We are world's apart. The pizzas cook very fast in Naples. They really do cook in 45-60 seconds. This makes them very, very soft and doughy. They are also very wet and don't hold up well when you pick them up. But they are fresher and more about an expression of the ingredients, which is the Italian way. Overall, for my personal taste, I like the top end NY and New Haven places best. Compared to most pizza in the U.S., even compared to regular NY street slices, these high end NY places have a lot of Neapolitan influence.\u00a0 But they bring their own character to the table too.\nFake Pizza - I've traveled around and visited lots of places that have been recommended to me or that make it high on Zagat or CitySearch.com lists, etc. I don't want to be insulting, but it's pretty clear to me that those recommending many of these places have never had real pizza. The locals have no reference. For example Atlanta.CitySearch.com used to give number rankings and Domino's scored 9.3 out of 10.... What can I even say about that?\nObviously, I have high standards and I couldn't begin to list all the places that don't measure up.. I don't mind bad pizza that much; what I hate is when places pretend to be great and then serve junk. For example, I don't eat a lot of Pizza Hut or Domino's but at least those places are more or less honest about what they are. Domino's claims to get a pizza to you fast and they deliver on that. Papa John's, in contrast, runs countless advertisements with their slogan \"Better Ingredients, Better Pizza\". Frankly, that just pisses me off. They are just a bunch of liars.\nOnce you get out of the northeast pizza gets a little weird . Pizza and tie dye. Hmmmm... Let me give you a scenarios that plays itself out countless times. You're traveling outside the northeast and you check the Zagat and go into the #1 pizza place in town. It's a trendy new place with a Woodstone brick oven (big time red flag). It's got a full menu of pizza's but usually other items as well. It's usually highly focused on 'gourmet' toppings and the menu may describe their high quality ingredients. \"We make our dough fresh everyday\" is one of my favorite claims because it shows they don't even know the value of fermenting their dough. They may have a blurb on the menu claiming the chef is from NY or Italy. They talk about their dedication to making great pizza or touting their reviews. Often there's a reviewer claiming that this new place is \"better than when I was in Italy\" or something like that.\u00a0\u00a0 They've got a Margherita pizza with \"Buffalo Mozzarella\" (instead of Mozzarella di Bufala). Then the pizza comes out and basically is no better than frozen pizza from the supermarket. The \"Buffalo Mozzarella\" is cow's milk (they think that mozz in the water is what makes it Buffalo), the basil is sprinkled on top in a chiffonade (yippee, someone took a cooking class), the sauce is brown and garlicky and the crust is flat, tasteless cardboard covered with cornmeal or brushed with oil. Seriously, any corner in NY is going to have a better slice than this. I would 100% rather eat an English Muffin pizza than one of these. I'm not being facetious. Usually the patrons split a pizza and some fried calamari and then move on to other entrees and can't even remember the pizza 5 minutes later. It's just weird and horrible. And it's repeated over and over and over. NYC has almost 2000 pizzerias. The top places in many cities would be in the bottom 300 in NYC. The single most common email I get is \"You think the pizza is bad in Atlanta, you should come here to [Town X].\" I could go on a rant naming names but I think I started to piss people off, LOL. I removed the list of these because I'm not trying to create bad karma. I just wish for a couple of simple things. First I want good pizza. Second, if you can't make good pizza, stop claiming that you are gourmet. It's the most overused word in the biz.\nThe only positive that's come out of these places is that they are so bad, they started me on my quest to make my own. So they spawned this website.\nMeanwhile, back in NYC... NY is not only ahead of the world, it's pulling farther and farther ahead. New Entrants like Zero Otto Nove are solid performers.\nTo help you on your tour, I've now plotted all my favorite places on this color coded Google Map . These include Tier 1 & Tier 2, the Naples Pizzerias and also the ones I haven't been to yet. The others may not be worth a special trip so I left them off.\u00a0 Where you are choosing between many, places with a dot in the middle of the map tag are better bets.\u00a0 Use the Mouse Wheel to point and zoom into the city that interests you. In a future version, each pizzeria will have a blog page where you can post your review.\nIf you are in NYC, let me recommend that you take Scott's Pizza Tour . I met with Scott and he's a really passionate and knowledgeable guy. I may even appear as a 'guest expert' someday on one of his tours.\u00a0 Not that he needs it. He can talk up a storm about pizza and he makes the tour a lot of fun!\nScott and me at Joe's Pizzeria on Carmine Street\nSo Finally, here is the list of what I consider to be the best pizzerias in the world:\nCity\n"}, {"score": 262.09946, "uuid": "7ea4273e-ab2d-5abe-a5c9-8a26c26b1334", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1814wb-94-20417", "target_hostname": "varasanos.com", "target_uri": "http://varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm", "page_rank": 1.2193608e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Jeff Varasano's NY Pizza Recipe", "snippet": "Also, note that all fresh dairy products sold in the US are made from <em>pasteurized</em> milk, whereas the European versions are often <em>unpasteurized</em>.

I don't think they are easy to find though.\nOthers praise these, but I have not tried them:\nStanislaus\nI know that Patsy's buys from Sassone in the Bronx (where I grew up). But I haven't tried a case yet. They may be repackaging any number of brands.\nEveryone vouches for Escalon, but I dislike them.\u00a0 The Escalon are round tomatoes, whereas most of the Italian brands are Plum tomatoes, which I strongly prefer. I also prefer the plain Cento Italian over the\u00a0 Cento DOP Certified San Marzano.\nHere are my\u00a0 Prep tips:\nAlways buy Whole Peeled Plum Tomatoes and crush them yourself.\nBe careful of marketing tricks like cans that say Italian 'Style' instead of Italian. Italian Style means nothing. It's subjective. If I grew tomatoes in Chernobyl I could still claim they are Italian Style.\nSimilarly there's a San Marzano 'Brand' which is grown in CA. I hate marketing gimmicks like that. The put the word 'brand' so small that you can barely read it.\nShake every can as you buy it. If it sounds watery, it is likely to be more bitter. Try to get cans which sound more viscous.\u00a0 The sound will vary a bit by season. They try to pick and pack in just one season, but still there are seasonal differences even within the same brand.\nIf you have a local tomato supplier, try those too.\nOne time I bought a jar of tomatoes at a farmers market - no can. These were hand packed and they had no tin can taste. They were excellent but all the major suppliers use cans.\u00a0 Be on the lookout for jars someday...\nIf you want to go crazy and make your own, try 'ugly ripe' heirloom tomatoes. The taste of these are amazing and I use these when I need whole tomatoes.\nWhen I open a can I taste it. Every can is a little different. About 10% of the cans I just throw out because they are too bitter and I put too much effort in the dough to waste it on a $2 can of bad tomatoes.\nDON'T make a sauce. That is, don't pre-cook the tomatoes. The tomatoes will cook on the pizza.\u00a0 If you cook a sauce first, it will cook again on the psizza, turning it brown and yucky.\u00a0 No need to make a sauce.\u00a0 Look at how overcooked many sauces are. The best places don't do this. This is actually the one step\u00a0 in this whole process that you can save yourself some time.\nI strain the seeds. This is really optional. If you do choose to do it, follow these steps, which seem obvious now, but took me a long time to flesh out:\nPour the can out into a bowl\nCut the green/yellow stem ends off the tomatoes with your hands or a paring knife, then discard.\nSqueeze out the seeds into the puree and then Dip the tomato into the puree. You can even cut the tomato open to get out any remaining seeds, by essentially rinsing them with the puree.\u00a0 This will have all the seeds fall into the puree.\nPut the flesh back in the can\nAt the end of this process you have a can of flesh and a bowl of watery puree and seeds. Strain this, pouring the puree back into the can.\u00a0 In the strainer are then 90% of the seeds, all by themselves. Discard the seeds.\nNow crush the tomatoes. This is one of those areas where I made a recent change for the better and it's really helped a lot. I used to crush the tomatoes by hand. But it was always a bit chunky. Now I blend them with an\u00a0 immersion mixer (\"boat motor\"). I cannot tell you exactly why this has made a huge improvement\u00a0 in the TASTE of the tomatoes, but it has. I've done side by side taste tests. The tomatoes should be crushed but not pur ed. Go Easy. I have nothing against using a food processor or mill, but I will say that you should not crush by hand.\nTomato Rinsing: All cans have some bitterness. You need some bitterness and you don't want to strip all of it out. But if the can is too bitter it's not good. I have a procedure I call tomato rinsing to remove some of the bitterness. But you have to taste the can and determine for yourself if it needs it. The better brands on my list don't.\u00a0 Here's the Tomato Rinsing procedure: Strain the tomatoes in a fine mesh strainer..\u00a0 If the mesh is fine, the water will be mostly clear with very little tomato escaping. If the water escaping is very red, pour it back on top of the tomatoes and continue straining. Eventually the water will run almost completely clear.\u00a0 Here's the key. The water that comes out is completely bitter. Taste it.\u00a0 What I do is pour fresh water on top of the strained tomatoes and strain them again. Taste this second batch of water.\u00a0 It's also bitter but less so. You are removing bitterness and acid without losing a drop of red tomato. Instead you are replacing this bitter water with fresh water. You can repeat this several times if you like, but once or twice is usually fine. The net result is that what is left over, which is all the red tomato solids, is sooooo sweet and yummy.\nHere are some other things you can do to remove the bitterness. But don't go crazy adding tons of spices and things. It's mostly just tomatoes.\nAdd some grated Romano cheese directly into the tomatoes.\u00a0 I use Locatelli Romano. Some have criticized this, but I like it.\nA bit of sugar will also help 1/4 - 1 teaspoon.\u00a0 Taste and see.\nA pinch of salt\nA pinch of dried oregano, crushed by hand to release the oils\nIf you are used to putting garlic in your sauce, try these steps once without it.\nTaste and taste\nSo you are removing and then adding back water. In the end though you should have less water than you started with. The total weight is probably about 1/3 less than you started with. But the exact amount of water you remove depends on the overall temperature of the oven and the temperature differential in the oven.. There is not much time in a hot oven to evaporate the sauce, so the hotter the oven, the drier the sauce must be going in.\u00a0 But if the top differential is high, the sauce will evaporate too quickly and needs to start wetter. You have to test. Surprisingly, if the sauce is too dry, it's not as sweet. You don't want it soupy but don't overstrain either. This will take real practice with your oven. Sometimes after the first pie I add more water to my sauce. Again, this is another area where recent improvements have really transformed the sauce. I think that when the sauce is chunky (hand crushed) it's harder to get the amount of water right.\nHere's the strainer and Immersion mixer I use:\nAlso, while straining, you are letting\u00a0 the crushed tomatoes sit uncovered and this really helps the tin can taste to dissipate. Prep the tomatoes when you make the dough. Even though you are not adding too much to your sauce, the tomatoes do better when the flavors settle in for a day and also the tin can taste dissipates. So prep a day or more\u00a0 in advance. Again, this is another recent change that has helped a lot.\nRefrigerate the tomatoes if you are not using them, but let them come to room temp when put on the pie. If the sauce is cold, the top of the dough is much colder than then bottom and you can end up with a thin layer of dough near the sauce that is gummier and less cooked than the rest of the dough.\nWhen you spread the sauce on the pie, put a little less in the center because the liquid tends to pool there.\nIf you are using a very hot oven like I am, don't go too close to the edge. Too much sauce near the edge will keep the cornice from developing well. In most of the photos below I put the sauce too close to the edge myself. I will be more conscious of this as I go.\nUse about half of the sauce that you think you need.\u00a0 Trust me. Experiment with less and less ingredients on the pizza and you will see a surprising improvement in overall balance.\nUsing Fresh Tomato\nAn alternative to canned tomatoes is fresh tomatoes. Even the best cans have a tinny odor, so you'd think that nothing could top fresh tomatoes. But using 100% fresh tomatoes is not necessarily the best thing. If you prepare fresh tomatoes and taste it raw, compared to canned, the fresh will win. But somehow, on the pizza, the canned will win. Partly it's that the fresh tomato taste is simply different than we are all used to and so it never tastes like your favorite pizza place.\u00a0 I've probably not experimented enough to say for sure. As I stated above, I don't recommend cooking your sauce before making a pizza, because the tomatoes will cook again on the pizza. If you think about it, the canning process itself forces the tomatoes to be heated once before sealing, then if you cook a sauce, that's heating #2 and then the pie is #3. So I recommend cutting back to 2 times. If you switch to fresh tomatoes though, you are back to just 1 time, on the pie itself. And for a 2 minute pie, that is not very much. So perhaps a solution, if you are using fresh tomatoes, is to cook a sauce. I will experiment a little more and edit this section.\nAnother possibility is to blend fresh and canned. This has a lot of potential, I think and I will experiment with this more also.\nHere's a method for preparing fresh tomatoes:\nStart with great tomatoes. I use \"ugly ripe\" heirloom tomatoes. These are the best to me. FYI, they are really amazing raw for a caprese salad (tomato, Mozz, basil, oil, balsamic, salt, pepper). Other heirlooms are probably good also, as are fresh picked local tomatoes. After that I'd probably go for plum tomatoes. I'm not a huge fan of the vine-ripe brand. They look great, but the taste is so-so. Regular beefsteak tomatoes are really not worth the effort.\nBlanch them. Blanching is a pretty easy technique. You just put the tomato in boiling water for 30 seconds or less, then take it out and put it in ice water for 30 seconds, then you can just peel it by hand.\nCored them with a paring knife and pull out most of the seeds by hand.\nGround them a bit with an\u00a0 immersion mixer\nStrained them. They were very, very wet and will lose a lot of weight in water.\nAdded a tiny amount of sea salt and a few fresh basil leaves from the garden and that's about it.\nCook them? As I said, this is my next experiment.\nAfter straining I figure that it would take about 3.5 lbs of tomatoes to equal one 35 oz can.\u00a0 Since Ugly Ripes are twice the price of any other tomatoes (they are VERY tasty) - $5.99/lb, this makes it over $20 for a small batch about equal to a $1.89 can. But who's counting...\n9- Grate some Locatelli Romano and/or parmessian cheese right on top of the tomatoes & basil\u00a0(do this whether you put some romano into the tomatoes or not).\u00a0 But don't over do it.\u00a0 Just a TINY little bit. But don't skip this step. It's really key to the sauce. Balance, balance, balance.\n10- Sprinkle kosher or sea salt\n11- Fresh Mozzarella.\u00a0 I live in Atlanta, and getting good cheese is a real problem. It's the weakest link in my pie right now. In NYC all the mozzarella is packed in water, but it is still firm.\u00a0 Down here in Atlanta, I can't find great fresh mozz. It's either dry cheese or else water logged.\u00a0 If the cheese is too wet, it will break down on the pizza and even disintegrate into ricotta.\u00a0 Ricotta is made by processing the leftover water used to make mozzarella.\u00a0 If the mozz is not made right, it will actually break down into ricotta before your eyes.\u00a0 Not good. You can see this in some of my photos.\nIn Naples they use Bufala Mozzarella which is made from water buffalo instead of cows. The problem with using Bufala Mozz here in the US is that it's mostly\u00a0 imported and usually not that fresh, especially during the summer. If you can find a good supplier, then use it. Also, note that all fresh dairy products sold in the US are made from pasteurized milk, whereas the European versions are often unpasteurized. If you've ever had butter or cheese in Paris, for example, you know that what we get here is bland in comparison. So reproducing what you tasted on your trip to Italy is difficult. There are a few American suppliers of Bufula Mozz including http://www.starhilldairy.com/prod_mozzarella.shtml which is available at many Whole Foods.\nPut only about 8-10 small pieces of cheese on the pie.\u00a0 Better to have a few dollops than an even mix. Trust me on this one too. If you find, as I did, that the cheese will not hold up to the intense heat and breaks down, there are few things you can do to keep the cheese from overheating on the pie prematurely:\nDry the cheese extremely well by wrapping in a paper towel for 1-3 hours. You'd think the wetter it is the better it would hold up to the heat, but its not so. The water inside boils and degrades the cheese. Sometimes the cheese is so wet I have to change the wrapping several times. This might be avoided by simply draining for a long long time. I think Marco says he drains for 8 hours.\nPut the cheese on in cubes rather than slices\nStart with cold cheese\nPut a tiny drop of sauce on them which has to boil off first, thus keeping the cheese insulated for a bit.\nDoing all of these may be overkill. You have to experiment with your cheese.\nMany cheeses packed in water are unsalted. If this is so, put in 1/4 teaspoon of kosher or sea salt in the water, preferably at least a day before you use it. Don't over salt the cheese, as this may cause some inferior cheeses to break down somewhat.\nIf you can't find a cheese locally, these are some suppliers that ship fresh mozz.. It's pricey to do it this way though:\nhttp://www.mozzny.com/ - Pretty good but not the best NY has to offer. They shipped them in a cold pack box and they came very fresh. If you don't have a local supplier, this is definitely a viable but expense choice.\nhttp://www.mozzco.com/ - I've not tried it, but these guys look very serious about their craft. Even more expensive than the previous one.\nMaking your own cheese\nAnother alternative is to make your own cheese. I'm no expert on this, so I'm going to refer you to other internet sources. But I'm going to give a super basic primer.\nGood sources of info.\nLeeners - I would start here.\nCheesemaking.com - this is an easy kit, but missing a few things.\nGoogle other recipes. There's a lot to learn.\nSome basics:\nMilk\nDo not use ultra-pasteurized dairy products. The ultra-pasteurization changes the structure and it won't curdle any more. Unfortunately, some states are allowing companies to remove the term 'ultra' and they are passing off ultra-pasteurized as just pasteurized. So be careful.\nStart with unhomogenized milk. You probably have to go to a farmers market or dairy for this. It should be about $6-$8 per gallon, which makes about 1 pound or a little more of cheese. When an animal is milked, it comes out as cream and skim and the process of homogenization blends them together. It's like shaking oil and vinegar, but the shake is so fine, it never settles out again. So an alternative to unhomogenized is to use cream and skim together. But most creams have been ultra-pasteurized, so you have to find one that is not.\nHow many water buffalo do you own? Well if you have them, use them, otherwise, find a cow. Water buffalo milk has more fat, so one experiment worth trying is to add more cream to your cow's milk.\nAcidify the milk. Milk will curdle best at a ph level of about 5.2. From my experience, using a ph test kit or digital ph meter is essential\nCitric Acid - the easy way. You measure the acid and blend it in and presto, it's acidic. But if you measure wrong, you are going to be unhappy with it. Note than many measuring spoon sets are not that accurate. 2 of my 1/2 teaspoons don't really equal one of my teaspoons, I discovered. There went 3 hours of my life I'll never get back. If you put in too much it will curdle but never form a ball and be stretchable. I've had the best results (nothing to write home about yet), using only 1.25 teaspoons per gallon of milk, which is much less than most recipes call for.\nUse a starter culture, just like you do for the dough. The culture eats the milk and make acid. It takes many hours though. Of course, this is the more authentic and flavorful method, but as with all these steps, more work. There are a lot of different cultures that can be used to vary the taste of cheese. Some recipes even just say start with buttermilk or yogurt. But for Mozzarella, the most authentic type is called Thermophilic , but even this seems to be a category and there are several varieties sold under that name. Just like with the yeast, there is a dry instant culture you just toss in and a wet, keep-feeding-it-forever variety.\nAdditives. These are all optional:\nItalian Mild Lipase Powder - an enzyme\nOther flavoring cultures. These are Lactobacilli that produce flavor but no acid. This mirrors the whole yeast/Lactobacilli combination we talked about with the dough. The yeast and Thermophilic organisms are doing the critical jobs of starting bubbles and changing the acid level. But the optional Lactobacilli are doing the flavoring.\nCalcium Chloride - helps to restore the balance between calcium and protein in store bought milk.\u00a0 It may also be needed with fresh milk. I've only seen this in the Leeners recipe.\nRennet - Once the milk is acidic and heated to about 88F, you add an enzyme called rennet and it curdles in just a few minutes\nVegetable or animal. Rennet originally came from the lining of an animal's stomach, but most companies sell vegetable rennet.\nTablet or liquid.\nFlaked Salt\nThermometer. These kits all use a hand held thermometer, but I prefer to use a digital meat thermometer, because you can just dip it over the side and get continuous readings.\npH Test kit or digital meter.\nOnce you've added the rennet, the milk curdles in a few minutes - it separates into chunky curdles and water whey.\u00a0 They you have to cut it to strain the whey out of the curds and then heat it by either microwaving it or pouring hot water (or whey) on it. I recommend the hot liquid because it gives more of a continuous heat, rather than the microwave method which has you heat it, then work it, then heat it again, etc.\nBe careful not to overwork the cheese or take out too much whey. Then you will end up pulling out all the fat and end up with a dry waxy cheese, like a Polly-O consistency. Watch this guy do it . He is starting with store-bought curd. It's a dark murky video, but worth watching.\n12- More salt\n13- Olive Oil - This is optional. In Naples they will typically put on a good olive oil. Many oils do not stand up well to these high temperatures. I had one pie at Una Pizza Napoletana in NYC with a very fruity oil from Calabria that was outstanding, even at the high temps. But I don't have the brand. The one's I've tried I can't recommend.\n14- Assembly - From the time the sauce hits the dough, the dough is starting to water log. Water logged dough will not rise. This is actually an area that I still need to work on myself. Look at this picture from last night. The rise on the crust is outstanding. but under the sauce the dough has not risen well. In fact it's a bit gummy. The reason is that after I sauced the dough, I took a long time to get it into the oven. Once the sauce touches the dough, the pie should go into the oven seconds later. Have your ingredients laid out so that you can sauce the dough, throw on the other ingredients and get it into the oven immediately.\n15- Into the oven for 2-3 minutes. There is a lot of talk about time and temp. Really, time is a better measure than temp. Ovens vary in temp from spot to spot and even 2 stones that have the same surface temp may have a different depth to that heat and that will really play out and affect the time. Ultimately, time is a better measure. There is a lot of debate online about how long it takes to bake a \"true\" Neapolitan pie. It started off as 2 minutes, then it went to 90 seconds, then 60, then 45 and recently 30 seconds. Some of this is a \"boys and their toys\" thing.\u00a0 Instead of arguing about horsepower people are arguing about oven temp.\u00a0 Chill out. It is true that in Naples, the pies cook very, very fast, usually in under 90 seconds.\u00a0 If your goal is a true reproduction of the Neapolitan style, then you may want to aim for this. But that is not the only style of tasty pizza. A pie that's cooked in 30 seconds is not necessarily better than one cooked in 150. The faster it cooks the less crispy and more airy it is. But this is only good to a point. Some dough that are cooked super fast have a burnt bitter outside and are raw inside.\u00a0 It takes a lot of practice to get it all right. Believe me, a 2-3 minute pie is going to be great if you follow these steps. My best pies were 2:10 - 2:30.\u00a0 Maybe it will get even better as I go down in time, but I'm skeptical of the 30 second pies.\u00a0 Patsy's makes a GREAT pie in about 4 minutes. Sally's, makes a great pie in 7. I've timed pies at Luzzo's in NYC at 1:55 and at Una Pizza Napoletana at 2:10. These are all notch places with great pies and crust. There's no question that a hot oven is important - you are not going to get a light airy crust with 10 minute pie. But once you are sub-5 minutes, you are easily in the range to make a great tasting pie, provided your dough formulation is correct.\nIf you are having problems with your pie burning on the bottom in a very hot oven, increase the hydration of the dough. Wetter dough burns less. But also, you may have to adjust the balance of temperature (top vs. bottom)\u00a0 in your oven using aluminum foil. See the section above regarding the oven.\n16- Remove from oven with a peel.\u00a0 When a pie cooks at these high temps, you may find that it is soggier than you are used to. In Naples, the pies are pretty wet and you cut them with a knife and fork and eat them on a plate. There are a few things you can do to lessen the moisture. Use less sauce and drain it well.\u00a0 But also, I put my pies on a rack when they come out so that any steam that is coming out of the bottom can escape. Just a 2-3 minutes on the screen then onto the metal round where they are cut.\u00a0 Don't cut too quickly. The flavors need to settle and they will be more distinct with a cooler pie.\u00a0 If you don't have a rack,\u00a0 you may find it helpful to transfer the pizza back and forth between the peel and the metal round, to allow the steam to escape from the bottom of the pie.\u00a0 Make sure you dry off the metal round between pies so that moisture doesn t build.\nWith High temp pies, there is the possibility of it being a little soggy in the middle especially if you are using a lower protein flour, such as a 00 flour. Brick ovens are very good at sucking moisture out of the dough very quickly. The environment is very, very dry. One downside of an electric, even one at 800F, is that the moisture tends to pool. One easy solution is to remove the pie from the oven and place it on a perforated metal round such as this one. I place this on my stovetop so that the bottom is exposed, allowing moisture to evaporate for about a minute. Then I move to a regular serving round.\u00a0 I've seen several 'modern' brick ovens that are gas fired. Burning gas creates moisture and ruins much of the effect of the brick oven. Brick ovens should burn wood or coal.\n17 -Season with oregano, red pepper flakes, black pepper and maybe a drop of olive oil (depending on how wet it already is).\n18- Cut and serve\nGood luck, but be prepared for a lot of trial and error.\nThis is a pretty good idea of what you will see if your oven is hot enough\nExcept for a minor malfunction of the fresh mozz, this is a pretty awesome pie. The new cheese instructions given above have since solved this problem.\u00a0 You can see that the dry cheese underneath bubbled and charred a bit. It was good, but I don't use dry cheese anymore.\u00a0 I will cut some cross sections next time to you can see how light the crust is inside. This pie used hand crushed tomatoes which I think are too chunky.\nThe spring back on the crust is excellent. The holes are big and the crust is light and soft. But this crust was too thin in the middle. Each pie is a learning experience. This pie had no dry cheese, just fresh mozz\nSprings right back after squeezing. Notice that the tomatoes were crushed by hand and are chunky. I recommend blending them with an immersion mixer or food processor instead.\nMore perfect charring\nThis pie was awesome. Overall it's probably the best I've ever made. The dough was in the fridge for 6 days. When I took the dough out of the sealed container, it had the aroma of a fine wine. I bet it could have gone another few days without a problem. You can see from the color that I used fresh mozzarella from 2 different batches. Both were excellent though. The cheese breakdown problem has been solved. No dry cheese underneath on this one.\nThis pie was made with KA Sir Lancelot (KASL high gluten flour) rather than my normal KA Bread Flour.\u00a0 The difference was pretty nominal. Flour is important but technique is more critical.\u00a0 The lesson of this pie is that the sauce should be a little thinner in the middle than anywhere else. Can you see it pooling towards the middle. Another lesson of this pie is that I need a better camera. My Sony CyberShot is small and chic, but takes mediocre close-up photos.\nNext KASL from the same batch. This was an excellent pie all around. It was comparable to the last bread flour batch that rose for 3 days, but not as good as the one that was 6 days old. That one was amazing. This pie was among the first with machine crushed tomatoes, rather than hand crushed. It was a huge improvement.\nThis cross section shows the bread structure. See the holes. They are pretty big and the dough is springy.\nThese cross sections are pretty good. The crust is well defined and high. While the bubbles are big they are not as pronounced as they could be. The likely cause: this dough over rose slightly.\u00a0 The big winner here was the sauce. This was among the first pies with the new sauce technique and it's really an improvement.\nSame pie on the bottom. Perhaps too charred, but good.\nThis pie was a 6 day cold rise Caputo Pizzeria 00 with 56% hydration. Caputo dough seem to absorb much more flour. I tried a pie with a 3 day cold rise also. I know that everyone is raving about the Caputo. Frankly, I hardly noticed the difference. Nothing wrong with it.\u00a0 But I wouldn't go crazy trying to hunt it down.\u00a0 In the last 4 months, mostly to deal with claims on the net, I've tried KA AP, KA Bread, KASL and now Caputo. I'm right back where I started from. Specialty flour is not a huge factor in this process. It's like when you see people arguing about the relative merits of 2 different tensions pulls on $1,000 tennis rackets, meanwhile they go out and miss the ball by 8 feet. Forget it. Maybe if you are making pies at the 99.8th percentile and you want to move to the 99.9th, then you should be worrying about this. Otherwise, let it go. Work on the BIG 3 factors: high heat, a good sourdough starter and technique (mixing and fermenting). This is where you will move from the 50th percentile to the 99th. Then worry about the relative merits of the type of milling or exact mineral breakdown of sea salt from one bay to the next. As in everything, work on the fundamentals.\nThis pie had excellent bubbles and spring. Another dough from the same batch rose 20 minutes less and was cooked at 725 (vs. 800 for the pie shown) and was dense with few holes.\u00a0 Technique, timing, heat - that's the ball game.\u00a0 Way down the list is the flour.\nMarch 2006\nThis dough was a 4 day cold rise using a blend of KA Bread, KASL and Caputo.\u00a0 Very wet dough. The big thing here was that I used my Kitchen Aid mixer instead of my DLX. While the DLX is far the superior machine, I now have a lot more experience with technique using a wet-knead. The result: the dough was just as good in the KA as it was with the DLX. The DLX is capable of mixing much larger batches and is easier to use, but for 4 pies or less, and with the wet-knead technique, I can now say that the KA dough is just as good.\nBoth pies were exactly a 2:30 at just over 800F. I've learned that the higher the hydration, the better it stands up to high heat. Dry dough will burn at high heat, but wet dough chars nicely.\u00a0 The cornice is not as well defined as it could have been, but the crust was super soft and tasty. These pies were as close to Patsy's as I've come. These were among my very best.\u00a0 They were amazing.\u00a0 The flavor, the texture, the sauce were incredible. But they were not quite as 'Neapolitan' as some are striving for.\u00a0 These were more NY.\nComparing Cheeses. Obtaining fresh Bufala Mozzarella can be difficult.\u00a0 The first pie is with Bufala Mozzarella but it's not as fresh as I'd have liked. The second is with cows milk. You can see that they melt differently. These pies were a blend of Caputo and KA Bread, baked at 840F for exactly 2 minutes each.\nThe charring on both pies was excellent.\nThis is one of my\u00a0 first attempts at making my own Mozzarella Cheese. It's just unhomogenized milk, citric acid, rennet and salt. Actually this pie had homemade dough, cheese and sauce. The sauce was from peeling ugly ripe tomatoes and reducing them. You can see the cheese burned a little bit.\u00a0 But it tasted pretty good. I have a long ways to go in the cheese making department...\nIf you use too much bench flour at these high temps you will find that the residual flour is bitter. But if you use too little you may find it hard to get the pie off the peel, especially since I am using a very wet dough. This takes some practice. If you can't slide the pie off the peel, you may have a mini disaster. A last resort way to recover is to fold the pie over into a calzone. This rustic looking calzone was the result of a trainee who forgot to flour the board at all. But no one complained. It was very tasty. The small amount of sauce on top will keep the top from burning as it puffs up closer to the heating element. I learned this trick from Luzzo's in NYC. If the ingredients inside the calzone are relatively dry (such as ricotta, mozz & ham), then the calzone is best if sealed. If the ingredients are wet, such as with this folded over tomato sauce, mozz pizza, then you may want to pop a small hole in the top to allow the steam to escape. Otherwise you may find the result in water logged inside.\nThis calzone was more planned. It's one of my favorite combinations: Rosemary, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh chopped tomatoes, mozz and pepperoni.\nThis is mostly for show - My current dough recipe doesn't really spin that well\nI Think this one had mushrooms on it. I'm going to post a section soon with other toppings, like my clam pie and my onion pie. But margarita pie is still the classic by which pies are judged\nThis pie was made with regular old White Lily flour you can find in any supermarket. It did behave and feel a little different - it had a heavier, gummier feel when kneading. But once you have experience you can compensate for these things.\u00a0 My guests did not notice the difference and said it tasted the same as the King Arthur.\nThe bubbles and spring were comparable to the King Arthur, but not as much as the Caputo\nA classic Marinara Pie - Garlic Oregano, parmesan and olive oil, also using White Lily Flour\nThe quality of the ingredients is very important. I have scoured the lands, trying every brand of flour, tomato and cheese I could find. I've had cheese flown in, paying $75 for enough cheese for just one round of pies, I've even made my own cheese from scratch, starting with just milk. I've tasted every brand of tomato I could find and peeled and blanched my own from local tomato growers. And theses things do make a difference. But there's just no getting around the simple truth of 'the big three' - High heat, good natural yeast, and mixing technique. Getting these right will cover a lot of sins and getting these wrong will screw up the best ingredients.\u00a0 Witness the crust on this pie made with cheap old White Lily flour.\nThis pie is Caramelized Onions with Emmenthaler Cheese. This combo goes well with fresh Thyme\nThis pie was very interesting. I made a fresh dough and then took an old dough that had sat in my fridge for about 10 days, and blended them together. This tends to make a very sour - sourdough. Not in a bad way, just very well developed and rich. Typically, if you do this, the dough will not have the lightest structure, but will be a little flatter and chewier. Again, not necessarily bad, but different.\u00a0 Still, some of my guests said this was one of my best ever.\u00a0 Also, I cut the cheese in cubes instead of slices and you can see the effect. It's similar to what Luzzo's did in the very next photo. Finally, this pie had a LOT of extra virgin olive oil on it. I often put none, but after trying Una Pizza Napoletana's pie, I gave it a try with a lot of oil. I think if I try this again I will go much lower on the sauce to compensate. This pie was also a little lower temp. Probably around a 3:00 or 3:15 pie.\nThis is my Sicilian Pizza, based on my grandmother's style that she made when I was a kid, except with a well fermented sourdough crust. I wish\u00a0 you could have tasted this one. Wow, it was tasty. I made this with a sourdough culture given to me by a fan of this site.\nThis pie is from Luzzo's on 1st Ave and 12th Street in\u00a0 NYC. Great place. I timed this at 1:55. The taste of the crust was virtually identical to mine. Notice how the cheese was put on in cubes and allowed to melt.\nThis pie is from Una Pizza Napoletana, just a block from Luzzo's in NYC. Another great place. I timed this at 2:10. The taste of the crust was also very similar to mine, but more mild, less sourdough. It's texture was definitely softer than mine. Anthony used all caputo flour, but also uses other 00 flours at times. This pie uses fresh Bufala Mozzarella which was very wet. You can see how it kind of melts and puddles in the middle. This is not what most are used to, but very common in Naples.\u00a0 The really obvious thing about this pie was that it had very little sauce and a lot of fruity olive oil which held up very well despite the heat. He said it was from Calabria but had no brand since it was provided by a friend who grows there. I prefer more sauce, but the olive taste was very very nice too.\nThis pie is from Da Michelle, which is considered one of the best in Naples. The is the authentic target.\nThis is Trianon in Naples, which is also one of the best\nDenino's - the best pizza on Staten Island. This is a similar style to Modern in New Haven. Wow. Tasty\nJoe & Pat's on Staten Island. This is a similar style to Johnny's. Thin but much crispier crust than a Neapolitan\nPizzeria Bianco in Phoenix\nWith Ed Levine, guest judge of Iron Chef America and author of the great pizza book, \"A Slice of Heaven\".\nAlso, the gracious host of this website :-).

This pizzeria claims to have invented the Margherita Pizza in 1889. The legend is that Princess Margherita was visiting Naples and the Pizzaiolo made 3 pizzas in her honor.

Aside from NYC, New Haven is probably the best pizza town in the U.S. There are at least 10 pizzerias there that are better than every pizzeria in my home of Atlanta. New Haven sports many styles of pizza, all good, but this is the quintessential \"New Haven Style\". No other town I've been in makes this kind of pizza.\u00a0 The pie below is half Marinara and half cheese. My photo of Modern Apizza, a few miles away, didn't come out that good. But Modern is even better than Sally's in my opinion.\nFranny's in Brooklyn. An amazing pizza.\nStyles of Pizza\nI created a few training videos for my staff on the styles of pizza. I decided to post these up as is, so pardon me if there are a few references other training materials.\nStyles of Pizza found in America - Walks you through about a dozen regional styles.\nDevolution of Pizza - This explains how pizza went from Naples to NY, then the chains that dominate pizza today.\nThe World's Best Pizzerias\nSliceNY has comprehensive listings, photos and reviews of hundreds of restaurants.\u00a0 In this article, I'm primarily interested in highlighting the very best places.\u00a0 Many of the best places are the ones that have stood the test of time. These are the 'old school pizzerias founded from 1905-1955. This article in SliceNY gives a good timeline that shows when some of these places opened. You will see that a good number of today's best places are spin-offs from just a few of the originals. But pizza is undergoing a revival. In the last 10 years, especially the last 5, a wave of excellent 'new school' pizzerias have opened. There are a few exceptions, but overwhelmingly the best places are either 'old school' or 'new school' with very few in between. During the 'Lost Years', 1960-1995, about all we got was junk like Domino's, Pizza Hut, CPK, etc. My quest began in 1998 with old school places like Patsy's.. But new places like Luzzo's have quickly risen to the top of a lot of lists.\nThere is an organization called Vera Pizza Napoletana (VPN) that certifies that pizzerias are making authentic Neapolitan pizza. Most of these places prominently post their VPN certification, with one even claiming their certification is \"an international award.\"\u00a0 However, no VPN pizzeria makes it into my top tier and several are among my bottom tier. Basically it's a marketing organization.\u00a0 You pay a few hundred bucks, you take a course and in a few days you are certified and can post a sign up that proves you are a great pizza maker. Yeah right.\u00a0 Personally, the certification means nothing to me. Certainly the best old school pizzerias don't bother with VPN.\nWhat makes a good pizza? I\u00a0 don't want to digress too far, but I used to teach a course on the topic of 'Mastery'. It's fascinating to me. There are a lot of similarities to the process of mastering things, regardless of the discipline. Whether it's the violin, karate, golf, finances, cooking - whatever- there are patterns which re-occur over and over. Understanding some of these patterns has definitely helped me improve my pizza tremendously. One pattern that you see is that you have to go through a long period where you learn lots of technique. However true masters have more than technical perfection and often violate 'the rules' of their discipline. Louis Armstrong and Frank Sinatra didn't hit every pitch or beat - they made up their own and it was better. True artistry has soul, not just technical perfection. In the Olympics, judges split the scores for technical merit and artistic impression. I know what they mean -\u00a0 Technically perfect can mean boring and lacking in character.\nI think that a lot of pizza bloggers are forgetting this. They are looking for technical perfection - how much spring is in the crust, how fast did it cook, how charred was it? I can understand that. But some are starting to sound more and more like wine connoisseurs, lost in the technical, and forgetting the total experience.\u00a0 Lots of people are ranking places high if they are \"authentically Neapolitan.\"\u00a0 This is not my standard. Ultimately I really try to rank things on how they taste. Sometimes there's a pie that's technically perfect but yet I would never remember it the next day. It's got all the check marks, but I'd never crave it. A16 in San Francisco is a good example - very high marks for looking and being an 'authentic' Neapolitan Pizza. But somehow it's just missing something. It has no soul to it.\u00a0 Johnny's, in contrast, may not have the 'oven spring' or other characteristics that many look for, but it's pretty much perfect. I go there looking to have 3 or 4 slices, but usually end up eating a whole pie of 8. No one at A16 is licking the plate like that.\nAs I've been to more and more pizzerias I've struggled with how to rank and classify them. People have been sending me recommendations and the list has grown a lot. I actually visited 95 pizzerias in 2007!!!\u00a0 I've decided to reorganize the rankings into 4 Tiers:\nTier 1 - These are the places that I highly recommend. These are worth the drive or even the flight.\nTier 2 - These are places that have a good reputation and have very good pizza but I can't quite recommend going out of your way for them. If you are in the area and are going on a pizza tour, you may want to include them. Technically, a lot of these places are good, but again, they are missing something. You can see my rankings for these places dip down into the 4's. I'm grading on a curve and with so many places to rank it was hard to space them. In Atlanta, these places would get 9's and Atlanta's current 'best' would be a 2.\nNotable - I've decided not to rank these. I list them but I don't give a number. Some of these places (Ben's for example) used to be great but now ride on their reputations only. Some are notable but not great. Take for Example, GoodFella's on Staten Island. It's the original unit that spawned the GoodFella's chain.\u00a0 I wanted to list it because a zillion people have told me to check it out and if you are a pizza nut like me you may want to pop in someday. But what can I really say about it. I can't really give it a number because it's really just an average NY pizza. I could walk through Brooklyn and pop into a random pizzeria and it's 50/50 that it may be better than GoodFella's. So short of listing every pizzeria in NY and ranking all of them, it's hard to rank GoodFella's. Yet it does get some buzz so I wanted to list it.\nNaples Pizzeria - I really really struggled with how to rank the pizzerias that I visited in Naples, Italy. I had 21 in all. I list the 10 that are well know below. The rest were mostly street pizzas. I decided in the end to list the Neapolitan Pizzerias separately. They are ranked in order with the best one, Gino Sorbillo at the top. However, the spread between the best and the worst was very tight. They were all remarkably similar and utterly unlike any American pizzeria. A few American places, like Zero Otto Nove, A Mano and Franny's are close in style, but given how consistent the real Neapolitan places were, it would be a mistake to put any of the American places in with them. The Neapolitan pizza is a definite style. When I returned I wrote up a 10 page report for a few friends on what I liked and didn't like about the style. I won't bore you with all of that. I'll just say this: it's an acquired taste. Most Americans would not fall down and say \"oh this is the best pizza I ever had\". At the same time, I now understand the snobbery of some of my Italian friends who say that what we make here is \"not really pizza\". We are world's apart. The pizzas cook very fast in Naples. They really do cook in 45-60 seconds. This makes them very, very soft and doughy. They are also very wet and don't hold up well when you pick them up. But they are fresher and more about an expression of the ingredients, which is the Italian way. Overall, for my personal taste, I like the top end NY and New Haven places best. Compared to most pizza in the U.S., even compared to regular NY street slices, these high end NY places have a lot of Neapolitan influence.\u00a0 But they bring their own character to the table too.\nFake Pizza - I've traveled around and visited lots of places that have been recommended to me or that make it high on Zagat or CitySearch.com lists, etc. I don't want to be insulting, but it's pretty clear to me that those recommending many of these places have never had real pizza. The locals have no reference. For example Atlanta.CitySearch.com used to give number rankings and Domino's scored 9.3 out of 10.... What can I even say about that?\nObviously, I have high standards and I couldn't begin to list all the places that don't measure up.. I don't mind bad pizza that much; what I hate is when places pretend to be great and then serve junk. For example, I don't eat a lot of Pizza Hut or Domino's but at least those places are more or less honest about what they are. Domino's claims to get a pizza to you fast and they deliver on that. Papa John's, in contrast, runs countless advertisements with their slogan \"Better Ingredients, Better Pizza\". Frankly, that just pisses me off. They are just a bunch of liars.\nOnce you get out of the northeast pizza gets a little weird . Pizza and tie dye. Hmmmm... Let me give you a scenarios that plays itself out countless times. You're traveling outside the northeast and you check the Zagat and go into the #1 pizza place in town. It's a trendy new place with a Woodstone brick oven (big time red flag). It's got a full menu of pizza's but usually other items as well. It's usually highly focused on 'gourmet' toppings and the menu may describe their high quality ingredients. \"We make our dough fresh everyday\" is one of my favorite claims because it shows they don't even know the value of fermenting their dough. They may have a blurb on the menu claiming the chef is from NY or Italy. They talk about their dedication to making great pizza or touting their reviews. Often there's a reviewer claiming that this new place is \"better than when I was in Italy\" or something like that.\u00a0\u00a0 They've got a Margherita pizza with \"Buffalo Mozzarella\" (instead of Mozzarella di Bufala). Then the pizza comes out and basically is no better than frozen pizza from the supermarket. The \"Buffalo Mozzarella\" is cow's milk (they think that mozz in the water is what makes it Buffalo), the basil is sprinkled on top in a chiffonade (yippee, someone took a cooking class), the sauce is brown and garlicky and the crust is flat, tasteless cardboard covered with cornmeal or brushed with oil. Seriously, any corner in NY is going to have a better slice than this. I would 100% rather eat an English Muffin pizza than one of these. I'm not being facetious. Usually the patrons split a pizza and some fried calamari and then move on to other entrees and can't even remember the pizza 5 minutes later. It's just weird and horrible. And it's repeated over and over and over. NYC has almost 2000 pizzerias. The top places in many cities would be in the bottom 300 in NYC. The single most common email I get is \"You think the pizza is bad in Atlanta, you should come here to [Town X].\" I could go on a rant naming names but I think I started to piss people off, LOL. I removed the list of these because I'm not trying to create bad karma. I just wish for a couple of simple things. First I want good pizza. Second, if you can't make good pizza, stop claiming that you are gourmet. It's the most overused word in the biz.\nThe only positive that's come out of these places is that they are so bad, they started me on my quest to make my own. So they spawned this website.\nMeanwhile, back in NYC... NY is not only ahead of the world, it's pulling farther and farther ahead. New Entrants like Zero Otto Nove are solid performers.\nTo help you on your tour, I've now plotted all my favorite places on this color coded Google Map . These include Tier 1 & Tier 2, the Naples Pizzerias and also the ones I haven't been to yet. The others may not be worth a special trip so I left them off.\u00a0 Where you are choosing between many, places with a dot in the middle of the map tag are better bets.\u00a0 Use the Mouse Wheel to point and zoom into the city that interests you. In a future version, each pizzeria will have a blog page where you can post your review.\nIf you are in NYC, let me recommend that you take Scott's Pizza Tour .

You want to peek in the kitchen in the back, as opposed to being served in the front.\u0094\nGabrielle Langholtz, the editor of Edible Brooklyn, which chronicles the borough\u0092s food scene, said it has grown along with the arrival of what she calls the \u0093new demographic.\u0094\n\u0093It\u0092s that guy in the band with the big plastic glasses who\u0092s already asking for grass-fed steak and knows about nibs,\u0094 Ms. Langholtz said.\n\u0093Ten years ago all of these people hadn\u0092t moved to Brooklyn yet,\u0094 she added, comparing Brooklyn today to Berkeley in the 1970s. \u0093There\u0092s a relationship to food that comes with that approach to the universe,\u0094 Ms. Langholtz said. \u0093Every person you pass has read Michael Pollan, every person has thought about joining a raw milk club, and if they haven\u0092t made ricotta, they want to.\u0094\nThe prevailing attitude is anticorporate, she said.\n\u0093Pre-industrial revolution tactics with food,\u0094 is how Frank Castronovo describes what he and Frank Falcinelli are up to at Prime Meats, a restaurant, specialty shop and butcher they are starting in Carroll Gardens, as well as Delightful Coffee, a cafe that will share a warehouse with the new Stumptown Coffee Roasters in Red Hook.\nAlong with butchering whole animals, Mr. Castronovo and Mr. Falcinelli, the owners of Frankies Spuntino restaurants in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side of Manhattan, will be making their own charcuterie at Prime Meats.\n\u0093The whole process, truthfully, will take a long time.\u0094 Mr. Falcinelli said. \u0093The aged stuff will take a year to understand. P\u00e2t\u00e9 will take a few months.\u0094\nMost of the artisans started simply and have stayed simple, like Salvatore Bklyn, makers of a superbly light ricotta. \u0093We were selling it out of the back of a truck,\u0094 Betsy Devine, who makes the ricotta along with her partner, Rachel Mark, said of their first retail efforts. Now their product is in eight stores.\nThey learned their craft on a visit to Tuscany. The Masts essentially taught themselves. Others, like Tom Mylan at Marlow & Daughters, a butcher shop opened in December by the owners of Marlow & Sons, found mentors.\nMr. Mylan apprenticed himself last year at Fleisher\u0092s, a highly regarded butcher shop in Kingston, N.Y., where he slept in the owners\u0092 TV room for a month and a half.\nAt Marlow & Daughters, all of the butchering is done in plain sight. \u0093We do this out on the floor because we want you to see the difference,\u0094 Mr. Mylan said. \u0093We can tell you it\u0092s all local, and it\u0092s all pastured, and buzzword, buzzword, buzzword, but until you take out a whole animal and put it on the table people have no idea what it means to bring really good meat into the city and break it down.\u0094\nMr. Mylan also teaches butchering at the Brooklyn Kitchen, a kitchen supply store in Williamsburg. He demonstrates with a whole pig. Every student goes home with six pounds of fresh pork.\n\u0093The classes have turned out to be much more of a success than I imagined,\u0094 said Harry Rosenblum, who opened the Brooklyn Kitchen with his wife, Taylor Erkkinen, in 2006.\nNext month, Bob McClure, of McClure\u0092s Pickles, will teach pickling there, and later this spring the Masts will teach chocolate-making.\n\u0093We\u0092ve become something like a community,\u0094 Mr. Rosenblum added, explaining that the store holds the occasional potluck and has a food literature book club. When baking no-knead bread in Dutch ovens was popular a couple of years ago, customers who bought the pots often returned with gifts of freshly baked bread.\nThe Brooklyn Kitchen carries major brands, but it is the sole retailer for knives from Cut Brooklyn, a local specialty knife maker.\n\u0093It\u0092s difficult to keep those guys stocked,\u0094 said Joel Bukiewicz, Cut Brooklyn\u0092s owner and solitary employee. \u0093It\u0092s like sweeping a dirt floor.\u0094\nMaybe that\u0092s because Mr. Bukiewicz takes 10 to 12 hours to fashion one eight-inch chef\u0092s knife. In an average week he will make between four and six knives. He first learned how to make hunting knives in Georgia, and started creating kitchen knives in his small Gowanus workshop in 2007.\n\u0093There\u0092s an appreciation here for craftsmanship and people who work with their hands,\u0094 Mr. Bukiewicz said. \u0093I had no idea there was going to be this convergence of artists, artisans and foodculture in Brooklyn.\u0094\nTo design a boning knife, Mr. Bukiewicz has been sitting in on Mr. Mylan\u0092s butchering classes and taking note of how his hands move.\nThat sort of collaboration is common.\nTwo weeks ago Sixpoint Craft Ales, in Red Hook, introduced Dubbel Trubbel, an ale made with cacao nibs from Mast Brothers Chocolate. Sixpoint Craft Ales already brews Gorilla Warfare, an American porter made with Ethiopian Yirgacheffe from Gorilla Coffee, the Park Slope cafe and roaster. At Wheelhouse Pickles, based in Park Slope, Jon Orren uses wort, a byproduct of brewing from Sixpoint Craft Ales, to flavor his Ploughman\u0092s pickle, a mild, earthy relish made with Greenmarket root vegetables.\nAnd McClure\u0092s Pickles, of Williamsburg, is making a strong, grainy mustard with Brooklyn Brewery\u0092s Brown Ale. (Mr. McClure, by the way, sometimes pays his picklers in pickles.)\nLocal store owners play an important role, more collaborators than simply merchants. Urban Rustic, Spuyten Duyvil Grocery, Blue Apron Foods, Bedford Cheese Shop and Marlow & Daughters all make a point of carrying Brooklyn-made foods.\nStinky Bklyn, a cheese shop in Carroll Gardens, carries wild boar p\u00e2t\u00e9 made by one of the salesmen at Smith & Vine, its sibling wine shop across the street. Robert Fischman, the fishmonger at Greene Grape Provisions in Fort Greene, sometimes sells fluke or striped bass he catches himself on one of the charter boats that departs from Sheepshead Bay. And later this spring the owners of Franny\u0092s restaurant in Prospect Heights will open Bklyn Larder, which will sell salumi cured in-house.\nSteven Manning, a manager at Urban Rustic, said he wants to make things easy for local food makers.\n\u0093There\u0092s no red tape,\u0094 Mr. Manning said. \u0093It\u0092s, Give me the chocolate, here\u0092s your money.\u0094\nAnother culinary stage is the Brooklyn Flea, the Fort Greene flea market, now in winter quarters in Dumbo.\n\u0093I try everything that\u0092s served there,\u0094 said Eric Demby, one of the market\u0092s founders, recounting the time he slurped down six bowls of soup in one sitting.\n\u0093There\u0092s an opportunity to be recognized, not just locally but nationally,\u0094 Mr. Demby said, explaining that Salvatore Bklyn created chocolate- and lemon-studded cannoli specifically for the market.\nNot everyone who tries out is a star.\n\u0093The longer I do this the more I get a sense of who\u0092s doing this for fun and who\u0092s doing this for a life\u0092s pursuit,\u0094 Mr. Demby said. \u0093The ones who are doing it seriously are the ones who wait before they approach me because they want to make sure they have it right before they come to the Flea. The ones who are doing it for fun are the ones who think it\u0092s a glorified bake sale.\u0094\nSome sellers at the Flea make sporadic appearances, like Plan B Foods, which sells caramelized onions in a jar. Now the onions are available at Greene Grape Provisions.\nOthers are regulars, like Mr. McClure and his brother, Joe, and Daniel Sklaar, a former financial analyst, who produces Fine & Raw, a velvety, complex chocolate made with unroasted cacao beans.\n\u0093I love being a part of this community,\u0094 said Mr. Sklaar, 28, noting that Fine & Raw\u0092s packaging was created by a lingerie designer paid with chocolate. \u0093Brooklyn is always in beta testing.\u0094\nBut for all the momentum, most members of this food movement are taking time to refine their crafts.\nEven though they could more than double their output to 2,000 bars a week, the Masts don\u0092t have a timetable for increasing production in their new factory, a tastefully raw space with exposed brick walls and a counter salvaged from a 100-year-old Pennsylvania ice cream parlor.\n\u0093We\u0092re not sure how a micro-batch chocolate factory is supposed to run,\u0094 Rick Mast said. \u0093We\u0092re going take our time and let it evolve.\u0094\nAs Michael Mast, 29, said, \u0093Slow growth, slow design, slow food. Slow, but without being flaky.\u0094\nThe mantra is similar at Prime Meats, which has been opening in stages since January.\n\u0093It\u0092s going to be incremental,\u0094 Mr. Castronovo said. \u0093But when it\u0092s ready you\u0092re going to totally trip.\u0094\nLogged\n"}, {"score": 259.69904, "uuid": "76907612-be12-569e-aaf8-8c3385b2b309", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1901wb-17-16097", "target_hostname": "www.bridges-mag.com", "target_uri": "http://www.bridges-mag.com/?p=76", "page_rank": 1.1795009e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Raw milk makes a splash: Ohio law requires raw-milk enthusiasts to", "snippet": "<em>Pasteurized</em> milk can be shipped more conveniently from the farm to supermarkets and stored for a longer period of time <em>than</em> untreated milk can, making it a commercially profitable product.", "explanation": null, "document": "Facebook\nThe Otworth farm not only is know for \"raw milk\" but also for fresh eggs and homemade sausage.\nWhen organic farmer Dwight Otworth decided to buy some dairy cows, he wasn\u2019t sure if his five teenage sons would like the taste of unpasteurized, unhomogenized milk \u2013 much less if he could offer raw milk to the public because of Ohio\u2019s restrictive agricultural product laws. He decided to add the cows to his growing menagerie of grass-fed animals anyway on his Five T Farms, in Franklin Furnace, Ohio.\nThankfully, the growing quintet \u2013 his sons Trenton, Trever, Travis, Traye, and Troy, for whom the farm is named \u2013 took to the milk, as has the general public.\n\u201cThey like it way better than store-bought milk now,\u201d said Otworth, who runs the farm with the help of his wife Jonda and the boys. \u201cWe go through about a gallon a day at our house.\u201d\nThe rest \u2013 about six gallons a day from two or three milking cows \u2013 the farmer sells through \u201cherd-shares.\u201d For an ownership portion of a cow, people who enjoy the taste and healthful benefits of rich, fresh milk from grass-fed, pastured dairy cattle can stop by the farm once a week to pick up a gallon of unpasteurized milk. That\u2019s because Ohio law forbids the sale of raw milk by state dairy farmers except to people who have an ownership stake in the herd.\nIn other words, to sample Otworth\u2019s cows\u2019 unprocessed milk, you agree to shoulder part of the cows\u2019 monthly boarding costs, which entitles you to a percentage of the cows\u2019 milk production for that month.\nNational trends play out in the Tri-State\nAcross the country, Americans are searching for direct-from-the-farm produce, meat and poultry, eggs and cheese, and other dairy products. Throughout the Tri-State, people like Cheryl Spriggs seek farm products that recall the superior taste and nutritional quality of the more natural foods they ate as children.\n\u201cI have been searching for raw milk in this area for years,\u201d said Spriggs, an Ashland resident who grew up with raw milk on the table every day. \u201cI wanted to experience it again and was pleasantly surprised to find the Otworths\u2019 herd-share program right in my own backyard.\u201d\nSpriggs is deeply committed to community gardening, community-supported agriculture, and other direct-from-the-farm initiatives that are cropping up (pardon the pun) in this area.\n\u201cIt\u2019s healthier to eat closer to the earth,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up that way, and I think it\u2019s a terrific way to support local farmers, such as the Otworths.\u201d\nSpriggs is not alone in her natural-food passion, but even most farmers don\u2019t want to take on the job of keeping a dairy cow, which requires milking twice a day.\nFor Jim and Cindy Yancy, who raise grass-fed livestock in Scioto County, it is simply easier to support the Otworths through herd-shares than it would be to keep and milk a cow of their own.\n\u201cWe stop by the farm twice a week for milk, which is probably the healthiest thing we eat,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cWe simply drop off the empty glass milk jug and pick up another.\u201d\nCindy also makes yogurt from the two gallons a week she brings home, and she freezes whatever is left over.\n\u201cSome people complain that raw milk from the farm is more expensive, but we feel fuller and more satisfied, so we snack less,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cI think, overall, I\u2019m saving at the grocery store, thanks to the milk.\u201d\nHusband Jim believes his joint pain has been significantly reduced since the couple began drinking the Otworths\u2019 raw milk about three months ago \u2013 and other aficionados make similar restorative claims for milk and other grass-fed farm products.\nIf you want to sample raw milk \u201cstraight from the farm,\u201d the ease of buying raw milk straight from the farm depends on the relevant agriculture regulations in your state.\nIn Ohio, consumers today must buy a share of the dairy herd to drink raw milk, which can cost as much as $12 a gallon according to the Wall Street Journal. Surrounding states offer other options. West Virginia currently outlaws the sale of raw milk to consumers, whereas Kentucky dairy farmers are not required to use a herd-share system to sell their raw milk directly to consumers.\nFamily photo: Dwight and Jonda Otworth bought Five T Farms in 1987. It\u2019s is named for the couple\u2019s five sons: Trenton, 19; Trever, 18; Travis, 13; Traye, 11; and Troy, 10.\nIn the wake of a multi-year legislative battle to keep raw milk available in Ohio, Dwight Otworth joined the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, which protects the rights of Ohio farmers to sell their products directly to consumers. After a 2006 ruling that established the legality of herd-shares, Otworth stepped into the dairy business to expand his back-to-organic efforts on several hundred acres of farmland along the Ohio River in Scioto County.\n\u201cMy farm isn\u2019t really a dairy farm per se,\u201d said Otworth, who still works in the construction industry to support the enterprise. \u201cWe also raise grass-fed hogs and beef cattle and sell eggs from pastured chickens because I want to raise and sell healthy products grown without chemicals.\u201d\nAfter purchasing his land in 1987, Otworth worked tirelessly to take the farm back to organic grain crops and livestock. By 2006, his 25-acre farm was certified organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a process that takes a minimum of three years. He also had his father\u2019s land, a farm of 113 acres adjacent to his own, certified organic, and he refrains from using chemicals on tillable acres he rents along Goose Creek.\n\u201cDirt is a living organism, or it should be,\u201d Otworth said. \u201cThe longer you go without chemicals, the better your milk and all of your other farm products will become.\u201d\nOtworth was moved to limit, then eliminate, chemical use when he saw his young sons playing out in the fields he and his father had just sprayed with insecticides and fertilizers.\nLiving on an organic farm is not an easy life, however. Controlling weeds is a challenge on chemical-free acres, and yields are lower until the soil recovers sufficiently \u2013 which is why organic products generally cost more than those grown on conventional farms. With limited output, Otworth sells primarily right at the farm and not at area farmers markets.\n\u201cThe water our poultry and livestock drink is clean and uncontaminated, and the dirt is finally returning to a good yield,\u201d he said. \u201cOur products are getting better and better.\u201d\nIn addition to raw milk, visitors to the farm can purchase eggs, whole-hog sausage, and grass-fed pork and beef. Any milk not sold is fed to the livestock, so nothing goes to waste. As the soil at Five T Farms continues to improve and consumer demand grows, Otworth will add grass-fed chickens and organic vegetables along with more dairy cows.\nIs a herd-share right for you?\n\u201cThey\u2019re not pets.\u201d Cows at the Five T Farms aren\u2019t named.\nIf you are interested in the healthful benefits of raw milk (see sidebar), you will pay a one-time share fee and monthly \u201cboarding\u201d fees for the right to buy and drink unprocessed milk.\nAt Five T Farms, members pay $50 for a full share or $25 for a half-share, a one-time fee with rights to the milk from a specific animal. Every month, a boarding fee of $26 entitles members to about four gallons of milk. Members who come to the farm from a distance usually take turns, as do those who split a share.\nAround the country, share fees range from $40 to $50, and boarding fees range from $20 to $30. Some herd-share programs involve the share members in semiannual \u201cshareholders meetings\u201d at the farm, and most require milk pick-up at the farm. Goat herd-shares are also available for those in search of raw goat\u2019s milk. In some regions of the country where demand outstrips supply, consumers may be placed on a waiting list for a herd-share.\nAt Five T Farms, milking is still a family affair accomplished by hand, and you can\u2019t get much more small-scale or \u201cnatural\u201d about your milk than that.\nAlthough there\u2019s a social benefit to knowing the farmer from whom you buy your milk, taste (which has been described as \u201clike melted French vanilla ice cream\u201d) and nutrition are the primary reasons people seek out direct-from-the-udder raw milk.\nAs Otworth sums it up, in his opinion, \u201cOrganic raw milk is the best way to go!\u201d\nWhat you should know\nIs raw milk healthful? Yes! People have been drinking raw milk since sheep and goats were domesticated in the Ancient Near East approximately 9,000 years ago, largely without harm. But pasteurization \u2013 a commercial practice since the late 19th century \u2013 is now the norm.\nRaw milk is a nutrition-rich food full of healthful fats and proteins. But, if not handled properly, it can spoil quickly and harbor disease-causing pathogens such as E. coli, salmonella, and listeria.\nUnfortunately for today\u2019s milk consumer, rather than legislating more careful treatment of raw milk, agriculture regulators responded to health concerns by requiring pasteurization, a process invented by Louis Pasteur in the 1860s that involves heating the milk quickly, then rapidly cooling it. Pasteurized milk can be shipped more conveniently from the farm to supermarkets and stored for a longer period of time than untreated milk can, making it a commercially profitable product.\nIn the opinion of those who favor raw milk, pasteurization destroys a perfectly healthful and safe natural product. Raw milk enthusiasts believe that heat-treating destroys beneficial bacteria along with harmful ones, degrades the protein, and eliminates healthful enzymes useful for digestion. For example, patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that causes periodic cramping, fever, fatigue and watery diarrhea, find that drinking unpasteurized milk can improve symptoms.\nThere is no national law against drinking milk obtained directly from a cow or goat, but the Food and Drug Administration banned the interstate sale of raw milk in the 1980s. About half of all states prohibit the sale of raw milk for human consumption, as West Virginia does. Consumers in Kentucky and Ohio have more options.\nWhen looking for raw milk sources, inquire about grass-fed dairy cows whose milk has fewer pathogens naturally than does milk from cows fed on grains, soybeans, or cottonseed meal. In general, experts agree that well-fed, pastured, healthy cows will produce healthy milk \u2013 which people can consume without risk and with major benefits.\nBarbara E. Cohen is an Indianapolis-based freelance writer who writes about regional foods and nutrition, local history, travel, and the arts throughout the Midwest.\nTo learn more about raw milk, visit the following websites:\n"}, {"score": 258.4649, "uuid": "891de426-220a-5e4d-9293-f8f49975ad40", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0206wb-65-06275", "target_hostname": "www.menshealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.menshealth.com/mhlists/motivation_to_lose_weight/Weight_Loss_Success_Strategy_5.php", "page_rank": 1.2186266e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Snack on Almonds - 10 Strategies for Successful Weight Loss", "snippet": "There is nothing <em>better</em> <em>than</em> losing weight that way!", "explanation": null, "document": "10 Strategies for Successful Weight Loss\nBy David Schipper\nWeight-Loss Success Strategy #5\nSnack on Almonds\nSeventy per day, to be exact.

Do not copy. All rights reserved and enforced.\nThe roots of Canadian cooking are British-American, though English-Canada seems to have shamefacedly-disavowed its British cooking tradition just in time to miss the revolution that British food has undergone.\nBeyond that, there is very little distinctly \"Canadian\" food. Instead there tends to be a lot of uninformed patriotism about food -- people saying Alberta beef is better than beef from Argentina or anywhere else in the world -- when in fact the person has probably never had beef from the Argentine, let alone anywhere outside of the Canadian border, or people saying a pizza has been transformed into a uniquely Canadian dish because fiddleheads (actually more popular in Asia) were tossed on it. Home-town boosterism is fine, but when it gets in the way of actually checking out the competition, it can hold you back.\nEthnic food only really started came to the fore in Canadian food magazines and kitchens in the 1970s, though some people question how cosmopolitan and multicultural things are now in Canada. Some say that having access to and eating at Ethiopian or Indian restaurants can be a substitute for other forms of actual engagement with the people or culture.\nMany Canadian foodies give the impression that Canada was a \"food wasteland\" before the 1980s. And it's true, the foundations of the food were basic by today's standards and educated palates. But when Canadians talk about \"good old-fashioned food\", it's the pre-1980s dishes and foods that they are referring to.\nIt was a Canada where there was a day of the week you made bread, and a day of the week you made butter, and a time of church and community hall suppers, with tables groaning with food brought in by the ladies from their kitchens. Geniuses at math, they'd know that to feed a turkey dinner to 250 people you'd need 7 turkeys, 75 pounds of squash, 75 pounds of potatoes, 20 large cranberry jelly rings and 44 pies. Plus 10 bunches of celery to garnish the glasses of tomato juice.\nFar from being a food wasteland, there was a plethora of foods, at these events, and at home. The ordinary, every-day food list may have included:\nroast chicken, corn, gravy, mashed vegetables such as potato, squash, turnip and carrot, scalloped potatoes, cabbage rolls, devilled eggs, roast beef cooked (one choice) well-done, pot roast, glazed hams, roast turkey, spare ribs in 4 different sauces, green and yellow beans, meatloaf and gravy, chow mein and tuna casseroles;\npancakes, pork and beans for breakfast, baking powder biscuits, strips of American-class bacon (peameal bacon being too expensive for everyday use), pancake syrup (maple syrup being too expensive for everyday use), chowder, boiled dinners with dumplings;\nrelish, chow-chow, pickles (dill, bread and butter, yum yum's, sweet mixed), hot dog relish, chili sauce;\nsparkling jelly salads in a place of pride to catch the light and reflect it;\nbean salads, coleslaws, tossed lettuce salads, potato salads with boiled dressings, Waldorf salad, macaroni salad;\noatmeal cookies, hermit cookies, squares, pies, butter cakes, apple betty, brown sugar fudge, Queen Elizabeth Cake, banana bread, angel food cake, marble cake.\nThe most published food writer in the world (Jean Par\u00e9), with 23 million copies of her books sold as of 2006, is a Canadian, and these are the foods she teaches Canadians how to make. Many mothers, rushing through the 1970s and 1980s working to help make ends meet as after-tax incomes in Canada dwindled and the cost of living went up, didn't have time to learn them, so the knowledge was almost lost with their generation. And to boot, the food press started looking down on these old foods.\nChinese food was considered exotic, but perhaps not entirely foreign. Take out was Chinese, Dairy Queen, fish and chips, A&W, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and chip wagons. The odd town was lucky enough to have a pizza parlour and a spaghetti house.\nAboriginal Food in Canada\nAboriginals are called \"First Nations\" in Canada. European settlers introduced to them metal vessels to cook in, as well as basic ingredients such as adding salt to food, cooking in fat, and the use of wheat flour and refined sugar. Potatoes, though grown by natives in South America, were introduced to natives in North America via Europe. In turn, the natives introduced foods to the Europeans such as fiddleheads, wild rice, and maple syrup.\nSome Indian nations (such as the Algonquin, Cree and Ojibway) were hunters and gatherers. West coast natives tended to be fishers.\nBeverages in Canada\nAlcohol laws vary by province. Alberta and Qu\u00e9bec are the only provinces in Canada where alcohol does not have to be bought from the state; Alberta privatized the sale of alcohol in 1993, apparently without the dire consequences that were predicted from those who had benefited from the previous state monopoly. (See also Qu\u00e9becois Food.) As of 2003, British Columbia has been slowly converting a few stores at a time to private-sector stores. But free market stores are finding it hard to compete, as they must still buy their alcohol from the state monopoly which only gives them a 13% discount on their shelf price;\nIn British Columbia, you can take home unfinished bottles of wine from restaurants;\nIn Ontario you may take your own bottle of wine to participating restaurants but will be charged a \"corking\" fee.\nIn the aboriginal nations that are now part of Canada's northern territories, prohibition remains in effect in many communities. In any event, the cost of alcohol is very high because it is flown in;\nBeer remains the preferred form of alcohol in Canada by more than double that for spirits or wine -- in 2005, 50.7% of alcohol sales were beer, 24.7% spirits, 24.6% wine;\nOnly 40% of Canadians have access to fluoridated water;\nIt is illegal to sell raw milk for drinking anywhere in Canada.\nUntil March 2010, Canadian law only allowed caffeine in cola soft drinks. This meant, for instance, that a different version of Mountain Dew had to be made for Canada, giving it a taste different from the original made in America. The EU had raised this issue since 1998 as a trade barrier. (SPS Trade Barrier Fiche: 010019-[1452] Canada- Caffeine in soft drinks.) The law was scrapped in March 2010. [Toronto Sun. More drinks can have caffeine: Health Canada. 19 March 2010 and CBC News. Caffeine in sodas OK: Health Canada. 19 March 2010.]\nCheese in Canada\nCanada seems to have opted for uniformity of quality in cheese, even though that quality isn't necessarily great. The few \"speciality\" cheddar cheeses available at supermarkets, such as a brand called Balderson, is actually owned by the giant dairy company, Parmalat. The Canadian cheese market is pretty much controlled by Parmalat, Kraft, and Agropur (founded 1938, taking in nearly 3,000 employees and 5,000 farmers.) Even Hershey's chocolate in Canada is produced by Agropur under licence.\nHealth Canada at times has wanted to ban even real Parmesan cheese, because it's made with unpasteurized milk. Had Health Canada been successful Canadians would have lost Sbrinz, Gruyere and Romano, as well, in addition to many European soft cheeses. In 1996, the government made a concerted effort to ban unpasteurized milk cheeses completely. Some say it was a way to ban the real versions of the cheeses, and instead force consumers to buy domestic knock-off versions; others saw it as a way to put any remaining small cheese producers out of business and hand it over to larger ones who could meet the regulations.\nAnyone hoping to make cheese in Canada also has to buy \"milk quota\" from a government agency in order to secure a supply of milk. If you're hoping to start producing cheese at a time when there is no spare quota available, you have to try to talk some other cheesemaker into selling you theirs, or you can't start business.\nNor can you bypass the government by just getting your own herd of cows. It is illegal to make cheese from milk that wasn't purchased from the government agency in most provinces. A rare licence, though, has been granted to the Upper Canada Cheese company in Jordan, Ontario (in Ontario's Niagara Peninsula) to use milk from its own Guernsey Cow herd starting in late 2005 (not all the cheese they make, however, is from their own milk.) Sadly, by April 2006, The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) had to put out a recall advisory on two of their cheeses that may been contaminated with Salmonella. They were allowed to reopen on 12th May; the salmonella was traced to milk from one of their suppliers.\nIn a few provinces, goat's and sheep's milk are not restricted by any government laws, and farmers can make cheese from their own milk if they so choose.\nAmerican cheese shops seem interested in carrying some Canadian cheeses, but say the high cost makes it hard for them to sell. Cheese prices across the border in America are often half of what they are in Canada.\nDairy in Canada\nSelling unpasteurized milk is illegal in Canada.\nMilk has to be pasteurized by licensed pasteurizing plants. By law, these plants are only allowed to process Canadian milk.\nIn 2009, a law (the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act, Bill C-6,) was proposed that would allow health authorities to search a private home with no search warrant required to look for unpasteurized milk in it. The proposed law was still under review at the end of 2009. [1]\nCanadian milk is more expensive than that in the States and in the UK. Milk prices rise at rates above inflation (between 1990 and 2000, prices rose 37.7%), even though most (nearly 3/4) of Canada's agricultural subsidies go to dairy. Imported dairy products are subject to high tariffs so that in effect they remain inaccessible to consumers.\nSimilar supply management systems for dairy were first introduced in Australia, then in the UK, by left-of centre governments, but in both countries the policies have now been abandoned and since then, both countries have seen a great amount of growth both in foodie choice, in decline of prices for consumers, and in initiative by producers resulting in award-winning new cheeses and other dairy products. It was the dairy industry in Australia, in fact, that asked for the regulations to be dismantled.\nIn Canada, however, it appears as though it would be very hard to dismantle, as many people who now have a vested financial interest in the way things are run vigorously maintain that the current situation is the best for consumers. The protected industries in Canada, it's been estimated, spend an amount worth around 25% of their annual sales to protect their protection, and to promote the thinking in the consumer mind that this is all for the better. When all else fails, the protected markets and subsidies are often said to be essential to defend cultural identity.\nIn Canada, it is very hard to get cream with a butterfat content over 35%; one or two (such as Western Dairies, actually in Central Canada -- Ontario -- despite its name) do make cream with a 40% butterfat content, but still well shy of the rich, 48% cream that is common in the UK.\nImported butter is banned to protect the domestic market. Imported butters are not banned in America, however, so people often smuggle the better butters in. Domestic butter in Canada is only available in the bare minimum butterfat content required by law, 80%. Canadian dairies and government officials say Canadians don't want a higher fat butter, but those who have tasted the 82 and 84% butters in England and Europe and know that such a thing exists, all come back raving about them.\nIn the 1960s, Dairy Councils encouraged farmers to switch to Holstein cows, away from Jersey Cows. The Jersey cow is universally considered superior, but Holsteins are more productive. As of 2006, there were only 3 herds of Guernsey cows left in Canada.\nDairies can only buy, by law, Canadian produced milk. Allowing imported milk would disrupt the state controlled Milk Supply Management system. It is also illegal to produce milk for sale without having a quota licence from the government. Each year, the government, through its marketing boards, decides how much milk will be needed for the upcoming year, and then allots every dairy farm operation its quota of that overall total. The amount needed is estimated nationally, then that amount divided amongst the provinces (not in equal amounts), who in turn then allot the amounts to producers. Once the milk is produced, the milk can only be sold back to the government marketing board. To sell it to anyone else is illegal; to use it even yourself to make a dairy product for sale is illegal. You have to buy it back from the government marketing board.\nThat being said, there is some import of ice cream and yoghurt allowed, mainly from the United States. But in general, Canadian dairy processors don't have access to milk outside the milk marketing boards, so they can't shop around for lower prices to stay competitive with producers outside Canada. But if the outside products were allowed in, Canadian dairy processors would go out of business if forced to buy high-priced milk and try to compete with external producers who don't have to. So, the solution was not to deal with the issue of the cost of the milk supply in Canada, but rather to restrict imports.\nThe result is that the most profitable farming business in Canada is dairy. As of 2003, dairy farming runs at a profit margin of around 25%, about triple that of normal business margins in Canada. The Consumers' Association of Canada estimates that Canada's dairy model costs consumers an extra $100.00 CDN a year more than they would pay if they were paying average world prices for their milk alone.\nThere are also trade restrictions on milk between the provinces in Canada.\nThe favourite flavour of ice cream in Canada remains vanilla, as of 2009. [2]\nFor the history of margarine in Canada, see the history section main entry on Margarine.\n[1] Hammer, Kate. Dairy desperado keeps the raw milk flowing. Toronto: The Globe and Mail. 29 December 2009.\n[2] Creighton, Judy. International ice cream flavours on the radar but vanilla still favourite in Canada Saint John, New Brunswick: Telegraph-Journal. 13 May 2009.\nHolidays\nNational holidays in Canada include:\nEaster Friday (people who work for the state are also given the Easter Monday off);\nVictoria Day -- the Monday closest to 24 May, marking the Queen's birthday;\nGenerally a holiday in August depending on the province;\nThanksgiving (in October rather than November as is the American one);\nChristmas;\nBoxing Day;\nNew Year's Day.\nThe first of July is also a holiday, known in recent history as \"Canada Day\", though some still prefer its former name of Dominion Day.\nLamb is not generally eaten at Easter; North Americans have yet to truly acquire a taste for lamb. Instead, ham is usually served.\nThanksgiving and Christmas are turkey and pumpkin pie, with other desserts also appearing at Christmas such as fruitcake (generally un-iced), mince tarts and shortbread cookies. On Boxing Day, leftovers from the day before are served.\nPancake breakfasts are held in southern-Ontario during maple syrup festival time.\nThe 24th May weekend, 1 July holiday and the August holiday are generally thought of in most people's minds as \"barbeque\" (aka \"grilling\") holidays, though more don't actually get around to it than actually do.\nMeals\nThree meals a day -- breakfast, lunch, dinner -- are considered the norm, though breakfast for many is a fond idea rather than a daily reality. Breakfast used to be a substantial meal, but now is either nothing, a bowl of cereal or a sweet bun caught on the run. Substantial breakfasts are reserved for Saturday or Sunday morning, either cooked in or eaten out. Breakfasts are inexpensive in restaurants.\nLunch is usually a light meal -- anything from sandwiches to an inexpensive restaurant meal or fast food during lunch hour, which is generally sometime between 12 to 1 or 1 to 2.\nDinner is the substantial meal of the day.\nIn rural regions, \"lunch\" may be called \"dinner\", and \"dinner\" may be called \"supper.\"\nMeat in Canada\nCanadian beef is grain fed. This makes it chewier than American beef. American beef is generally softer, juicier, darker and sweet.\nIn Ontario, it is illegal to buy pork which has not ultimately been bought through the Ontario Pork Marketing Board. In 2001, Alberta converted its Pork Marketing Board into a true \"marketing\" organization to promote pork, and abolished its status as the sole legal purveyor of pork in the province.\nWhat Americans call \"Canadian Bacon\", Canadians call \"back bacon.\"\nMany bemoan the difficulty of getting good beef hot-dog wieners in Canada.\nA marketing board called the \"Turkey Farmers of Ontario\" controls the production of nearly half the turkeys produced in Canada each year. Its 192 members must purchase quota rights to be allowed to produce. [1]\nModern Food in Canada\nCanada is on Europe's top-five list of food imposters.\nA Canadian company has copyrighted the name \"Prosciutto\" in Canada [2], and Canada allows the sale of knock-off Feta, Romano, Parmesan, etc cheeses. Canada considers these names generic, and small producers and cooperatives in Europe who actually have the rights to the products can't afford lawsuits against the large Canadian companies that make the knock-offs, particularly in the realm of dairy in which Canada has government support. The real cheeses that aren't banned from import \"for hygiene\" reasons have high tariffs placed on them to make it hard to sell them at a price consumers can afford when they hit the store shelves. Though Canada -- witness its policy on imported cheese -- seems to be obsessed with food hygiene, over 2 million Canadians a year still get food poisoning.\nIn June 2003, the Canadian government reached a tentative agreement with the European Union. For Canada's part, by 2013, Canada is to stop allowing alcohol names such as Burgundy, Chablis, Champagne, Chianti, Claret, Grappa, Jagertee, Korn, Madeira, Malaga, Marsala, M\u00e9doc, Moselle, Ouzo, Pacharan, Port, Rhine, Sauternes and Sherry being used by anyone except the genuine producers in Europe. In return, the EU will protect Canadian Rye Whiskey and Canadian Whiskey as registered names, ensure that wines labelled as coming from the Fraser Valley, Lake Erie North Shore, the Niagara Peninsula, the Okanangan Valley, Pelee Island, the Similkameen Valley, and Vancouver Island actually come from there, and grant Canada favourable concessions on allowing Canadian Icewine into Europe.\nThe favourite eating out places in Canada are McDonald's, Tim Horton's, and other doughnut chains. Coffee is ordered in terms of how many sugar packets, and how many creamers you want in it. You can say 1 cream, 2 sugar, or if you want 2 of each, \"double-double\", or \"triple-triple\" even.\nA few chefs experiment with fusion food, using Canadian wild ingredients (usually expensive to obtain) and techniques from other places such as Asia, but it remains novelty food, not what people eat. Foods such as arctic char, birch syrup, and fiddleheads are as foreign to Canada's actual, rather than revisionist, food history as are curry and pad thai -- though the curry and pad thai are far more common.\nGrocery stores include A&P, Costco, Dominion, IGA, Loblaw's, Safeway, and Sobey's. Loblaw's used to operate in Pennsylvania and upper and western New York State as well from at least 1927 until the fall of 1976.\nMyths about food in Canada\nMaple syrup is a national food more in word than in observance. Maple syrup is only made in the eastern part of the country. In fact, if it weren't for a maple leaf now on the flag, people in the western half of the country wouldn't know what one looked like, as they're not native to western Canada. Per capita, Canadians consume 6 tablespoons (3 fluid oz / 90 ml) of maple syrup a year, and only 7.5% of the maple syrup produced in Canada is consumed inside the country; 82 % of it is exported, and the remainder, 10.5%, languishes in warehouses owing to lack of demand for it anywhere. In 2004, the Canadian government created and started promoting a \"flavour wheel\" for maple syrup, based on the concept of a wine wheel, providing 91 terms that can be used in describing maple syrup. Sadly, as of 2006, none of its maple syrup producers seemed to have heard of the idea or the promotion.\nNanaimo Bars are popularly thought to have been \"invented\" in British Columbia, but they were actually being made in Alberta decades before they arrived in British Columbia.\nCanadians are invited to believe that Canadian cheese is the best in the world. It's not, but Canadians don't generally have access to other cheeses because of price or availability to compare.\nButtertarts, believed in the popular mind to be uniquely Canadian, are actually Scottish.\nRegions\nIn some ways, if you were to draw a map food-wise of North America attempting to plot the food regions of Canada, you'd find that your map wouldn't follow the 49th parallel. Food-wise you have the west of North America, consisting of California, Oregon, Washington State, and British Columbia; the prairies and plains; the Great Lakes provinces and states and the American heartland; Quebec, and the East, consisting of the Maritime provinces and New England.\nCanadian food is generally the same as American food barring regional specialties, but the politics behind it are different. For instance, Canadian food staples -- wheat, eggs, chicken, pork, dairy -- are produced under a system of supply management by the state. This means the food item in question is governed by price and production controls set through agencies set up by the state.\nCanadian rural country is not dotted with small towns just down the road from each other, as it is in America or Europe. Instead there will be hundreds of miles with just very small hamlets, and then a medium-sized town.\nIn the west of Canada, carrot pudding is the Christmas pudding, rather than plum pudding;\nBritish Columbia has perhaps slightly more Asian influence than the rest of Canada;\nBritish Columbia's lower mainland has the longest growing season in Canada; Joni Mitchell wrote the famous lyrics \"They Paved Paradise\" about Vancouver;\nThe Ukrainian influence was strong in Manitoba.\nStreet Food\nCanada does not have a vibrant, regular, lively street food culture.\nThe street food in Toronto is pretty much limited to hot dogs, called \"smog dogs\" by the locals. They are served with the basics -- ketchup, mustard, nuclear-green coloured relish -- or corn relish, onions, and sauerkraut. Here and there, especially in the downtown university area, there are also a few trucks selling chips (aka French Fries), and occasionally in the summer, an ice-cream truck whizzes by at a speed incredibly fast lest anyone should actually be able to flag them down and buy something (the trick is, to flag them down first, get them stopped, and then organize who wants what, and then the money.) And occasionally, you will see a cart selling popcorn and chestnuts. Above all, though, Toronto is in love with that iconic American food, hot dogs.\nThe law for the province that Toronto is in -- Ontario -- requires that any street food vendors meet the same standards as restaurants do. Food has to be kept within certain temperature ranges, hot and cold water have to be available for the food prep people to wash their hands, etc. Hot dogs are an exception because they are pre-cooked. In New York, which Toronto often likes to compare itself to, the street food includes falafel, chilli, kebobs, etc. The sad part is, though, at least Toronto has some street food -- most other Canadian cities have very little or none at all to speak of.\nSmaller towns used to have \"chip wagons\" or \"chip trucks\" which, like their counterparts in England, would sell cones or small boxes of thick-cut chips (\"French Fries\" for Americans.) When done eating the chips, you would drink the salty malt vinegar from the bottom of the cones for a mouth puckering combination of sweet, sour and salty. These chip trucks though are slowly disappearing, being regarded as unhealthy and too \"old-fashioned Canadian.\"\nVegetables in Canada\nThe small, island province of Prince Edward Island (PEI) is the largest producer of potatoes in Canada, though the province of Manitoba is second and catching up fast. In Canada, there is no regulation saying the actual variety of potato being sold in grocery stores has to be declared to consumers. This has caused the problem that consumers just see all potatoes as a generic commodity: they have no reason to think that it's worth paying more for one producer's potatoes over another. As of 2003, several grocery stores, including Dominion and A&P, started experimenting with not selling potatoes as all purpose. Instead, they separated loose potatoes into bins according to what they are best for, as they have been sold for some time in the UK. Potatoes for the offering are hand-selected, double-washed before sale and kept at optimal storage temperatures even during transport. This selling approach allows producers to have their potatoes marketed more than as just commodity items. Bulk potatoes sell (as of 2003) for $0.99 to $1.29 CDN per pound (450 g); $ 1.29 is at the high end of the range of what a consumer will pay, but the marketing technique could mean the edge in a consumer picking one producer's potatoes over another.\nIn Canada people giving over portions of their front yards or back gardens to vegetable gardens in urban areas is seen as a bit odd, or a sign of poverty. No matter how hard up a family is, it's more the done thing to buy all the vegetables you need, in order to demonstrate that you can afford to.\nAlmost all garlic in Canada sold in grocery stores is imported from America.\nWheat in Canada\nCanadians often see themselves as the \"breadbasket\" of the world, but they are not in fact the world's leading producer of wheat. From 1999 to 2004, Canada produced only 23 million tonnes of wheat, while America produced more than double that in the same period, 57 tonnes. Depending on the year, Australia and Canada swap places between second and third place for largest wheat producer.\nOf the 23 million tonnes Canada produced, approximately 8 million were consumed in the country, and 15 million exported, primarily to the EU and Japan.\nThe Canadian Wheat Board has control over wheat and barley grown between British Columbia and Ontario. Wheat grain east of Ontario is exempt from their control. The Board was first established as voluntary in 1935 for farmers by the Conservative government; in 1943 a Liberal government made it compulsory.\nWheat farmers are compelled to pool all their product and sell it to the wheat board. The theory is that by there being a single seller and eliminating competition, the Board can get a better price overall. Even farmers who wish to grind their own wheat to sell as flour have to first sell it to the Board and then buy it back at marked-up prices -- even if the grain never actually leaves their farmyard. Grinding your own wheat into flour to sell without going through the Board lands farmers in jail.\nEven though occasionally data is produced to show that the Board garnered a higher price for farmers, critics say it's far from certain that any of the extra money they gained for farmers actually reaches the farmers. They say this may be because the Board has a large number of bureaucrats to pay, as well as high liabilities in terms of \"non performing\" loans the Board extended to foreign countries in the form of credit that will probably never get paid back.\nThe Wheat Board has great powers. It is exempt from Freedom of Information legislation, and doesn't have to report to Parliament. Newspapers have carried stories of early morning helicopter raid teams descending onto farms suspected of selling wheat to anyone other than the Board. Allegedly, \"farmers suspected of selling their grain independently [have] ended up face down in the dirt\" with their wrists bound, then strip searched and imprisoned. [3]\nDespite the issues, Canadian wheat growers still manage to turn out wheat that is milled into the top flour in the world, bar none. Canadian flour is unsurpassed for quality on almost every level and test.\nCanadian Food Achievements\nAll-Purpose Flour: Canadian Flour is the first and still the greatest Canadian success story. Canadian wheat makes the finest Flour in the world, bar none. Despite everything that is said about bread vs cake vs pastry flour, somehow magically Canadian all-purpose flour basically handles all those tasks effortlessly. A Canadian housewife would have to be pretty bored with her lot in life to experiment with cake or bread flour -- if you say flour in Canada, it means all-purpose, end of story.\nMagic Baking Powder, the North American standard, was created in Toronto in 1897 by the E. W. Gillett Company.\n____________________________________\n[1] \"Turkey Farmers of Ontario, comprised of 192 quota-holding farmers and with an elected board, controls nearly half of Canada's annual quota turkey production \u2013 60 million kg a year.\" -- Webb, Margaret.

In the same year, Kraft processed cheese slices were also introduced into Canada.\nThe transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railways was noted, up until the 1960s, for the quality of its food and service\nProhibition in Canada\nOne of the strongest social reform groups in Canadian history, though now forgotten and replaced by others, was the Women\u2019s Christian Temperance Union. An organized force across the Dominion, they felt that alcohol abuse was at the bottom of the social problems in Canada\nMost of the crusaders were middle-class Canadians who felt that the lower classes needed help in governing their own vices -- provided of course that those weren't vices that the middle-class also held dear. Some feel that it might also have held the benefit of creating a \"stable, disciplined workforce\" better able to serve the needs of the middle-classes.\nThough American prohibition (1920 to 1933) gained more prominence, prohibition actually started earlier in Canada, possibly because Temperance forces linked Prohibition to supporting the war effort (Canada entered the First World War in 1914; 3 years before America did). Sober men were better fighters, and grain was needed to feed soldiers on the front, not to make drink for people at home. Campaigners seem to have dodged the topic of men at the front having more than the odd drink.\nProhibition started in the province of Alberta on 1 July 1916, outlawing the sale and purchase, though not the manufacture, nor the transport of alcohol into and out of the province. In 1918, the Alberta Provincial Police force (replaced in 1932 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) was created in large part to help enforce the law when it was tightened to include the manufacture and import of alcohol. Prohibition lasted in Alberta for 7 years, ending in 1923.\nOther provinces:\nSaskatchewan (1 July 1915 to 16 July 1924)\nPrince Edward Island (1901 to 1948)\nManitoba (February 1916 to 1924)\nNova Scotia (1916 to 1929)\nNew Brunswick (1917 to 1927)\nOntario (1915 to 1926). (Alcohol less than 2% remained legal; alcohol for export could still be made). At the end of prohibition in Ontario, 15 out of 64 breweries remained in business, one of them called \"Labatt\".\nDuring prohibition in Canada, some police officers, such as Chief Walter P. Johnson of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, ended up on the payroll of those involved in illegal alcohol sales.\nProhibition even remained in effect in an area called \"The Junction\" of Toronto, Canada until 1997, in the towns of Cambridge, Maitland and Tidnish in Nova Scotia until June 2005, and in Manitoba towns such as Hanover and Stanley until 2006.\nIn Ontario, you were not allowed to have a glass of wine with your meal at restaurants until 1967. After that you could have a drink at a restaurant with a meal between noon and 3 pm, and 5 and 9:30 pm.\nIn Ontario, you could not buy any alcohol, even a bottle of wine, on a Sunday until the state-owned alcohol stores started Sunday sales on 7 December 1997.\nBritish Columbia was the first province to start state-owned alcohol sales in October 1920.\nAt times, the state sale of alcohol in Canada seems to involve a bureaucracy that would have impressed Moscow civil servants in the Soviet Union; at other times, it seems incredibly provincial and Methodist. In January 2006, when a Toronto restaurant named \"Le S\u00e9lect Bistro\" with a wine cellar of 12,000 bottles moved from one location to another 4 or 5 blocks (less than 500 metres) away, it was told by the government it had to get a new liquor licence for the new location, which it did. As soon as it did, it was told it had to sell every single bottle of wine back to the state-owned alcohol stores, then buy it back from them under the new licence.\nTo make matters worse, the State refused to have anything to do with 1/4 of the wine stock, as it was no longer in their current catalogues (bottles that had been aging in the wine cellar for up to 30 years), and the restaurant didn't have receipts proving that it had been bought from the State in the first place back in 1977 (the restaurant had kept paperwork for 7 years as required by tax year, then destroyed it). To boot, it is illegal to sell alcohol in the province where the restaurant is, Ontario, if it hasn't been purchased from the State. As a result, the restaurant was put in a position that if they sold a single bottle from their wine cellar in their new location, it would be an illegal sale and the full force of the law would have been thrown at them. In the end, they managed to prove through old catalogues from the state owned liquor store chain that the state had indeed carried the bottles at one time, and the restaurateurs were able to unseal their wine cellar. The owners at the end offered the State officials a glass of wine, but the officials declined.\nAppliances in Canada\nCanadians got major electrical appliances later than Americans did. While the Americans experienced a revolution in the reduction of kitchen and other household work in the 1940s and 1950s, the cost of those goods to Canadians remained prohibitive to most once they crossed the border owing to high Canadian import tariffs in place to protect small Canadian manufacturers such as Beatty of Fergus, Ontario.\nThe first mass brands in Canada were Frigidaire, General Electric (GE), Kelvinator, Philco, and Westinghouse. As demand for appliances grew amongst Canadians wanting to catch up with their American neighbours, it became feasible for the manufacturers to set up plants in Canada, thus avoiding the artificial costs associated with the import tariffs imposed by the Canadian government and making the products affordable for everyday Canadians.\nby 1976, 99% of Canadian households owned a refrigerator\nby 1986, 55% of Canadian households had a freezer (separate from the refrigerator)\nby 1979, 26% of Canadians households had a dishwasher (compared to 43% in America). By 1986, it was 38% of households.\nby 1982, 10% of Canadian households had a microwave (compared to 27% in America and 31% in Japan). By 1986, the figure was 44% in Canada, compared to 60% in America.\nDairy History in Canada\nIn 1918, the province of Ontario had nearly 900 cheese factories: \"Canadian dairymen should feel justly proud of the position they hold today in the markets of Great Britain. Not only is Canada the largest exporter of cheese but she also holds the record as to quality. Not so many years ago our cousins to the south had the inside track in the British market, and as they had very little competition, they paid more attention to quantity than quality, with the very natural result that an opportunity was given for Canadian dairymen to try and capture that market. How well they succeeded need not be dwelt on here. It is sufficient to say that Canadian cheese \u2014 one of our largest manufactured products and exports \u2014 is competing successfully in the markets of the world against all comers. The reason for this is not hard to find, it is simply that the quality of the goods appeal to that greatest of all food value experts, Britain\". James W. Mcleod, M.P.P. in Stiles, Harlow M. Official History of the Cornwall Cheese and Butter Board. Cornwall, Ontario: Cornwall Cheese and Butter Board. 1919, p22.\n\"It is only a little over fifty years since the manufacture of cheese was undertaken in this Province, and yet to-day it has attained such proportions that it is a big factor in the economic and national life of the country. Last year, the value of the dairy output of Canada was estimated at approximately two hundred million dollars, and of this upwards of half is to the credit of the good old Province of Ontario. It is well to remember that this grand result, in the aggregate, was achieved only by the multiplication of small units such as represented by the Cornwall Cheese and Butter Board....I would be sorry to see any system adopted which would not give adequate rewards for energy, industry, thrift and ability, which have been the cardinal, if old-fashioned, virtues upon which success has been founded in the past.\" -- Hon. George S. Henry, Minister Of Agriculture, Ontario in Stiles, Harlow M. Official History of the Cornwall Cheese and Butter Board. Cornwall, Ontario: Cornwall Cheese and Butter Board. 1919, p25-26.\nEarly in the history of the country, government intervention in dairy was limited to financial support for infrastructure such as iced cars on railways to carry butter (1895), funding for cheese curing rooms (1902), dairy herd testing programmes (1902) and grading of dairy products for export (1932). Direct subsidies began in 1935 during the depression for cheese and butter production. During the war years, the depth and breadth of subsidies were increased, as well as the introduction of limits on imports. By the mid-1960s, a full Canadian Dairy Commission was created.\nThough overall imports of ice cream and yoghurt account for less than 1/2 percent of the market in Canada, the government at one point tried to shut them down, too. The WTO (World Trade Organization), however, disallowed their efforts on 5 December 1989, decision (L/6568 - 36S/68), basically saying that while it wasn't all that fond of Canada's system in the first place, such imports couldn't be banned because they didn't seem to undermine in any significant way Canada's state managed system. \"Against this background and in the absence of an imminent threat to the Canadian dairy system, the Panel found that the criterion of 'necessary' to the operation of the governmental restrictions could not be met.\"\nIn 1997, little New Zealand took on Canada by lodging a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) that a separate support scheme for Canadian dairy producers, which subsidized their exports, was creating unfair competition in world markets, while at the same time denying other people access to Canadian markets. The Americans agreed and joined New Zealand in the complaint. The WTO agreed with New Zealand and America in May 1999, and struck down an appeal by Canada in December 1999. In December 2002, the WTO agreed with New Zealand that a replacement scheme put in place by Canada provided the same subsidies under a different name. Finally, in May 2003 Canada agreed to dismantle those illegal subsidies as well.\nHomogenized milk first went on sale in Canada on 8 April 1927. It was offered by the Laurentian Dairy of Ottawa, Ontario, 13 years after it first appeared in America. [2]\nWidespread compulsory pasteurization of milk was first introduced in Canada in the province of Ontario in 1938. Previously, only some cities in Ontario (and across Canada) had made it mandatory in those cities. Reputedly, compulsory pasteurization was championed by the provincial Premier at the time, Mitchell Hepburn, who saw children in hospital because they had contracted diseases such as tuberculosis from being given unpasteurized milk to drink. [3] The campaign for it had been led by a Women\u2019s Institute leader, Adelaide Hoodless of Hamilton, Ontario, who had lost an infant in 1896 to unpasteurized milk. [4] [5]\nOther provinces followed in legislating compulsory pasteurization of milk within those provinces. Finally, in 1991, it was taken under a nationwide umbrella through an amendment, called the \"Milk Act\", to the Federal Food and Drug Act.\nToronto Delicatessens\nDowntown Toronto, particularly the old Jewish area of Spadina, used to have delicatessens that locals still wax poetic over. Until the relatively recent advent of a plethora of ethnic restaurants, which began in the early 1980s, deli food was perhaps the only commercially prepared food worth waxing poetic over -- that and having a good, as in really good, local fish and chip shop.\nToronto was a pastrami town, like New York and Chicago. Old-timers still close their eyes talking about the quality of the pastrami Toronto had.\nThe great delis were Becker's, Moe Pancer's, Shopsy's, and The Bagel, though many felt that the Holy Trinity was Switzer's, Famous Deli and The Bagel. And fans were divided between the corned beef at Shopsy's versus Switzer's.\nSwitzer's was at 320 Spadina in a narrow three-storey building with a sign at the very top that said \"Party catering specialists\". It was known for its corned beef on rye with mustard, kosher dills, knishes, kishka with gravy, cream soda and Vernor's ginger ale.\nThe waitresses at The Bagel were famous for being brusque; if you said what they'd brought you wasn't what you'd ordered, they'd sit down and eat it themselves. Speculation circulated about when the floor had last been washed, and about their beef-vegetable soup, claiming that it was only ever emptied out fully twice a year, at Pesach and Rosh Hashanah.\nEventually, all the delis closed up downtown and moved far, far north to the suburbs, at least an hour's drive.\nShopsy's was started in 1921 by Harry and Jenny Shopsowitz at the corner of Spadina and Dundas, near the Anshei Minsk synagogue. They tried to modernize and make it as a chain, on their own at first. Eventually, they sold out to Lever Brothers, who made them into a chain and a brand.\nToronto's deli heritage is now reduced to corporate chains such as Druxy's, Shopsy's or the Pickle Barrel.\nBick's pickles, which to many Canadians now is how pickles are supposed to taste, was established in 1951 by Walter and George Bick.\n________________________________________\n[2] Trout, G.M.

Up to that time, the enforcement of pasteurization had been left largely in the hands of local municipalities......a few cities of the Dominion have compulsory pasteurization.
