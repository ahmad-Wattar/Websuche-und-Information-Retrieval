All environmental agencies that we\u2019ve worked with have \u201cunofficially\u201d stated they prefer a biodegradable, nontoxic fluid to a petroleum heavy metal containing one. Realistically, in the event of a spill, even after several years in service, which would cause less environmental damage, a readily biodegradable fluid, that originally contain no harmful additives or metals, or a fluid that is petroleum based, that will persist in the environment for years, preventing oxygen exchange, causing sludge, that was formulated with heavy metals such as zinc, copper and barium?\nThe \u201cEdible Oil Act\u201d requires environmental agencies to take base-fluid type into consideration when assessing spill damage and associated fines. A client of ours in your \u201cneck of the woods\u201d, Elliot Bay, Puget Sound, recently spilled about 200 gallons of biobased oil. The Wa. State DEP has a formula based on type of fluid, persistence, toxicity, amount spilled, where it is spilled, and what time of year that determines what the \u201cfine\u201d will be. Originally, based on conventional petroleum hydraulic fluid the fine was assessed at $40,000! After meeting with the DEP, reviewing toxicity and biodegradability data, other precedents and so forth, there was no fine at all. In over 10 years of promoting biobased products and multiple client spills, I have never had a case where a fine was not either eliminated or dramatically reduced due to the use of an environmentally preferable fluid. I published a paper a while ago, tailored to the commercial diving industry that reviews biodegradable fluids and regulations.

Action needs to be taken today to switch to oxo-biodegradable before millions more tons of plastic waste accumulate in the environment.\nTop\nIsn't it better to recycle than to let it biodegrade?\nYes, and one of the benefits of oxo-biodegradable plastic is that it can be recycled as part of a normal plastic waste stream (see http://www.biodeg.org/position-papers/recycling/?domain=biodeg.org ) However, if the plastic is not collected it cannot be recycled, so it needs to biodegrade instead of accumulating in the environment.\nTop\nWhat about energy recovery?\nIn some countries incineration is popular, and modern equipment is in place. Oxo-biodegradable plastic can be incinerated with energy recovery in the same way as conventional plastic, and has a higher calorific value than the hydro-biodegradable alternative.\nTop\nCan it be composted?\nOxo-biodegradable plastic does not degrade quickly in low temperature \"windrow\" composting, but it is suitable for \"in-vessel\" composting at the higher temperatures required by the new EU animal by-products regulations. Indeed it is likely that windrow composting will soon have to be phased out.\nTop\nWhat happens to it in a landfill?\nOxo-biodegradable plastics fragment and partially biodegrade to CO2 and water in the parts of the landfill where oxygen is present, but the residues are completely inert deeper in the landfill in the absence of oxygen. They do not emit any significant amounts of methane.\nBy contrast, hydro-biodegradable (starch-based) plastics will degrade and emit CO2 in a landfill if there is enough microbial activity. However, in the depths of a landfill, in the absence of air, hydro-biodegradable plastics generate copious quantities of methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas.\nTop\nDoes it contain \"heavy metals\"?\nNo. It contains transition metal ions of Cobalt or Iron or Manganese, which are trace elements required in the human diet. They should not be confused with toxic heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, Cadmium and Chromium, which are never used in oxo-biodegradable plastics.\nTop\nIsn't it made from oil?\nYes. Oxo-biodegradable plastics are currently made from a by-product of oil or natural gas. These are of course finite resources, but the by-product arises because the world needs fuels, and would arise whether or not the by-product were used to make plastic goods.\nUntil other fuels and lubricants have been developed for engines, it makes good environmental sense to use the by-product, instead of wasting it by \"flare-off\" at the refinery and using scarce agricultural resources to make plastics. In fact plastics could reduce the amount of oil and gas imported because after their useful life they can be incinerated to release the stored energy, which can be used to generate electricity or to heat buildings.\nRecently, interest has been shown in manufacturing sugar-derived polyethylenes. These, like oil-derived PE, are not biodegradable, but they can be made oxo-biodegradable in the same way as the latter, by the addition of a pro-degradant additive.\nTop\nBut aren't the hydro-biodegradable plastics renewable?\nNo. because the process of making them from crops is itself a significant user of fossil-fuel energy and a producer therefore of greenhouse gases. Fossil fuels are burned in the machines used to clear and cultivate the land, and in the manufacture and transport of fertilisers and pesticides and in transporting the crop itself. Energy is also used by the autoclaves used to ferment and polymerise material synthesised from biochemically produced intermediates (e.g. polylactic acid from carbohydrates etc). When the material biodegrades it emits CO2 and methane, so the total fossil fuels used and greenhouse gases emitted are more than for conventional or oxo-biodegradable plastic.\nHydro-biodegradables are sometimes described as made from \"non-food\" crops, but are in fact usually made from food crops, and drive up the price of human and animal food.\nIn June 2009 Germany's Institute for Energy and Environmental Research concluded that oil-based plastics, especially if recycled, have a better Life-cycle Analysis than compostable plastics.\nT op\nDoes it leave any harmful residues?\nNo. Oxo-biodegradable plastic passes all the usual ecotoxicity tests, including seed germination, plant growth and organism survival (daphnia, earthworms) tests carried out in accordance with international standards.\nTop\nDeliberately and totally lost?\nThe argument that oxo-biodegradable plastics are undesirable because their components are designed to be deliberately and totally lost is a fallacy, because if people want to incinerate with heat recovery, or mechanically recycle them, or compost them in-vessel, or re-use them, then that's OK, and they cost very little if anything more than conventional products. The key point is what happens to the plastic which is not collected, and gets into the environment as litter?\nIn any event, oxo-biodegradable plastics are not \"deliberately and totally lost\" even if they degrade in the environment, because biodegradation on land is a source of plant nutrients, just as is straw, grass, leaves etc.\nBy contrast, hydro-biodegradable plastics are \"deliberately and totally lost\" because the applicable international standards require them to convert to CO2 gas within 180 days.\nTop\nMore careless disposal?\nDegradable plastic bags have been supplied by supermarkets for more than four years, but there is no evidence that people dispose more carelessly of them (whether oxo or hydro biodegradable) and they have not been encouraged to do so.\nBut suppose for the sake of argument that 10% more were discarded. If 1,000 conventional and 1,100 oxo-biodegradable bags were left uncollected in the environment, 1,000 conventional bags would remain in the rivers, streets and fields for decades, but none of the oxo-biodegradable bags would be left at the end of the short life programmed into them at manufacture.\nThere will always be people who will deliberately or accidentally discard their plastic waste. What will happen to all the plastic waste that will not be recycled or will not be incinerated, and instead will litter the countryside - would it not be better if the discarded plastic were all oxo-biodegradable?\nTop\nIs it safe for food-contact?\nYes. Oxo-biodegradable plastic has been certified by RAPRA Technology Analytical Laboratories as safe for long-term contact with any food type at temperatures up to 40\u00b0C. RAPRA is accredited by the United Kingdom accreditation authorities as meeting the requirements of International Standards Organisation norm no. 17025. It is also certified as compliant with FDA requirements in the US.\nTop\nCan it be marketed as Biodegradable or Compostable?\nOn 8th April 2010 the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa ruled that bread bags made with oxo-biodegradable plastic can be advertised as Biodegradable.\nThe current EU Standard for composting (EN13432) is not appropriate for testing oxo-biodegradable plastic. However the EU Packaging Waste Directive does NOT require that when a packaging product is marketed as \"degradable\" or \"compostable\" conformity with the Directive must be assessed by reference to EN13432. The Directive provides that conformity with its essential requirements may be presumed if EN 13432 is complied with, but it does not exclude proof of conformity by other evidence, such as a report from a reputable body. Indeed Annex Z of EN13432 itself says that it provides only one means of conforming with the essential requirements.\nTop\nIsn't it better to use paper bags?\nNo. The process of making paper bags causes 70% more atmospheric pollution than plastic bags. Paper bags use 300% more energy to produce, and the process uses huge amounts of water and creates very unpleasant organic waste. When they degrade they emit methane and carbon dioxide.\nA stack of 1000 new plastic carrier bags would be around 2 inches high, but a stack of 1000 new paper grocery bags could be around 2 feet high. It would take at least seven times the number of trucks to deliver the same number of bags, creating seven times more transport pollution and road congestion.\nAlso, because paper bags are not as strong as plastic, people may use two or three bags inside each other. Paper bags cannot normally be re-used, and will disintegrate if wet.\nTop\nIsn't it better to use durable re-usable bags?\nNo. Long-term re-usable shopping bags are not the answer. They are much thicker and more expensive, and a large number of them would be required for the weekly shopping of an average family. They are not hygienic unless cleaned after each use. Whilst sometimes called \"Bags for Life\" they have a limited life, depending on the treatment they receive, and become a very durable problem when discarded.\nShoppers do not always go to the shop from home, where the re-usable bags would normally be kept, and consumers are unlikely to have a re-usable bag with them when buying on impulse items such as clothing, groceries, CDs, magazines, stationery etc.\nHowever, for those who believe in long-term re-usable bags, they can be made from extended-life oxo-biodegradable plastic and will last for 3-5 years.\nTop\nHow long does it take to completely degrade?\nAn important advantage of oxo-biodegradable plastic is that it can be programmed to degrade in whatever timescale is required. The average useful life of a carrier bag is about 18 months, but shorter or longer times are possible. During that time bags are often re-used for shopping or for use as bin-liners etc. Heat and light will accelerate the process, but they are not essential.\nWhat products are available in oxo-biodegradable plastic?\nCarrier bags or \"shopper-bags\" which consumers use to take away their purchases from the shop\nRefuse sacks, which consumers buy in rolls at the shop, and use for disposal of their ordinary household waste.\nAprons, for the protection of garments, in the home, hospitals, restaurants, workshops etc.\nBags to contain dog faeces collected in parks, gardens, etc\nBin liners\nPlastic sheeting for a variety of applications in agriculture and horticulture.\nPlastic film for wrapping newspapers and magazines.\nBread bags\n"}, {"score": 1347.7925, "uuid": "2ef221cc-f525-56a5-8ff6-f2597588527a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0103wb-30-17644", "target_hostname": "www.biodeg.org", "target_uri": "http://www.biodeg.org/faq/?domain=biodeg.org", "page_rank": 1.654205e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "<em>the</em> degradation", "snippet": "<em>What</em> types of <em>biodegradable</em> plastics exist? <em>What</em> <em>are</em> <em>the</em> <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> oxo-<em>biodegradable</em> <em>and</em> hydro-<em>biodegradable</em> plastic?

Oxo-biodegradable plastic has been certified by RAPRA Technology Analytical Laboratories as safe for long-term contact with any food type at temperatures up to 40\u00b0C. RAPRA is accredited by the United Kingdom accreditation authorities as meeting the requirements of International Standards Organisation norm no. 17025. It is also certified as compliant with FDA requirements in the US.\nTop\nCan it be marketed as Biodegradable or Compostable?\nOn 8th April 2010 the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa ruled that bread bags made with oxo-biodegradable plastic can be advertised as Biodegradable.\nThe current EU Standard for composting (EN13432) is not appropriate for testing oxo-biodegradable plastic. However the EU Packaging Waste Directive does NOT require that when a packaging product is marketed as \"degradable\" or \"compostable\" conformity with the Directive must be assessed by reference to EN13432. The Directive provides that conformity with its essential requirements may be presumed if EN 13432 is complied with, but it does not exclude proof of conformity by other evidence, such as a report from a reputable body. Indeed Annex Z of EN13432 itself says that it provides only one means of conforming with the essential requirements.\nTop\nIsn't it better to use paper bags?\nNo. The process of making paper bags causes 70% more atmospheric pollution than plastic bags. Paper bags use 300% more energy to produce, and the process uses huge amounts of water and creates very unpleasant organic waste. When they degrade they emit methane and carbon dioxide.\nA stack of 1000 new plastic carrier bags would be around 2 inches high, but a stack of 1000 new paper grocery bags could be around 2 feet high. It would take at least seven times the number of trucks to deliver the same number of bags, creating seven times more transport pollution and road congestion.\nAlso, because paper bags are not as strong as plastic, people may use two or three bags inside each other. Paper bags cannot normally be re-used, and will disintegrate if wet.\nTop\nIsn't it better to use durable re-usable bags?\nNo. Long-term re-usable shopping bags are not the answer. They are much thicker and more expensive, and a large number of them would be required for the weekly shopping of an average family. They are not hygienic unless cleaned after each use. Whilst sometimes called \"Bags for Life\" they have a limited life, depending on the treatment they receive, and become a very durable problem when discarded.\nShoppers do not always go to the shop from home, where the re-usable bags would normally be kept, and consumers are unlikely to have a re-usable bag with them when buying on impulse items such as clothing, groceries, CDs, magazines, stationery etc.\nHowever, for those who believe in long-term re-usable bags, they can be made from extended-life oxo-biodegradable plastic and will last for 3-5 years.\nTop\nHow long does it take to completely degrade?\nAn important advantage of oxo-biodegradable plastic is that it can be programmed to degrade in whatever timescale is required. The average useful life of a carrier bag is about 18 months, but shorter or longer times are possible. During that time bags are often re-used for shopping or for use as bin-liners etc. Heat and light will accelerate the process, but they are not essential.\nWhat products are available in oxo-biodegradable plastic?\nCarrier bags or \"shopper-bags\" which consumers use to take away their purchases from the shop\nRefuse sacks, which consumers buy in rolls at the shop, and use for disposal of their ordinary household waste.\nAprons, for the protection of garments, in the home, hospitals, restaurants, workshops etc.\nBags to contain dog faeces collected in parks, gardens, etc\nBin liners\nPlastic sheeting for a variety of applications in agriculture and horticulture.\nPlastic film for wrapping newspapers and magazines.\nBread bags\n"}, {"score": 1317.4589, "uuid": "c458412c-6d65-59e7-b8ec-f727127665dc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1903wb-69-12385", "target_hostname": "www.greenerpackage.com", "target_uri": "http://www.greenerpackage.com/discuss/bioplastics/incineration_biodegradables", "page_rank": 1.201291e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "Incineration of <em>Biodegradables</em> | Greener Package", "snippet": "Posted by Katherine M. * <em>What</em> is greener? <em>Biodegradable</em> or 100% recycled?

Additionally, I HATE plant based packaging (please refer to my blog for more, as their is no need to beat a dead horse).\nI personally prefer Reduce, Recycle, Reuse. You can use percentages of post consumer resin with HDPE, the resin is fully recyclable (be careful about the addition of colorant). Getting consumers to recycle is a whole other story, but my strong opinion is to focus on weight reduction, post consumer and/or post industrial resins and recyclability.\nPosted 1 day ago\ndesigner, Two Bags in One\nLocation: Coin, , Malaga, Spain\nRole: Designer\nThomas, you are completely right when you write that biodegradability is a farce.\nEncountering bag litter almost everywhere is disgusting. Making it biodegradable results in enduring that litter during only 3 years instead of 10 or 50 years. (more I'm probably dead...) So what ?\nIt's like oil: we all benefit from oil, but we don't accept spilling it ie in the Mexican Gulf ! We like using these small bags but don't want to see them in our environment, be it only for 2 years !\nI hope consumers will note this embezzlement.\nThere is a solution:\nNo further need for small carrier bags. shopping is done in a normal nice carrier bag who converts into a big black trash bag.\nA simple, efficient and no nonsense solution who eradicates the use of small shopping bags.\nDirk.\nFrom a direct carbon\nRhett Adams...\nFrom a direct carbon footprint angle the 100% PCR content is most likely going to perform the best. HDPE is a highly recycled resin with established markets and systems for recycling, I really see no advantage in making a HDPE like resin that biodegrades. Biodegradable is a marketing niche and has no long term benefits. Recycling has long term benefits. Have you looked at Calcium Carbonate in HDPE? OMYA is the mineral supplier, but the pellets come from master batchers. - Rhett\nPosted April 12, 2011\nNational Packaging Manager, DS Waters\nIndustry: Beverage\nLocation: Grand Prairie, TX, USA\nRole: Packager\nI definitely agree with the comments that Biodegradable/PLA plastics are a bad deal. When talking to a company pushing those resins, the first thing they say is, \"oh, but you can recycle those parts also.\" Here are my top 10 issues:\n1. Biodegradable promotes landfilling not recycling - that is their niche.\n2. No matter what is said about recyclability, biodegradable material is a contaminant. there will always be a % concentration mix max to deal with.\n3. How can a recycler/blender determine between biodegradable plastic and virgin? Can we depend on the purity of any regrind mix?\n4. PLA plastics based on a foodstuff takes food off the table and drives up the price of important grains such as corn.\n5. PLA plastics based on a foodstuff grain reduces the success to address world hunger - supply, price.\n6. Same concerns about recycling purity - PLA is an impurity to stock resins and will always have a % concentration mix max.\n7. Stops the molecule. Best is to keep the molecules of plastic flowing/recycling.\n8. Loose energy supplement options. When plastic is recycled to its max usage cycle, programs are now available to then turned it into energy.\n9.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calculates the impact of GHG emissions based on three timeframes: 20 years, 100 years and 500 years. Which timeframe a community or a nation chooses to use is a policy decision based on whether they want to emphasize the short or long term. At the Kyoto Protocol, the 100-year timeframe was chosen as the international baseline because climate change was seen as a longer-term threat. Fifteen years later, our climate situation is more dire and immediate than we thought. Now we must cut emissions 80% by 2050, if not significantly sooner. Now we need data to emphasize the short-term impacts of our emissions so we can prioritize reductions to powerful, short-lived gases like methane. We need to look at the impacts of our emissions over the next 20 years if we are going to avoid runaway climate change.\n(Source:IPCC, 2007. \"Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\" Chapter 2: Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing .)\nBack to Top\nWhy it\u2019s so important to reduce methane quickly\nMethane only stays in the atmosphere around 8-12 years while carbon dioxide can last for centuries. But methane has a big effect in its short time\u2014methane is responsible for 75% as much warming as carbon dioxide measured over any given 20 years (Watson, 2009). This means methane reductions could have an immediate beneficial effect on our climate, faster than comparable reductions to CO2.\nClimate change is happening at an alarming rate. Leading nations are calling for emissions reductions of 80% by 2050 and others are saying we need to reduce emissions much sooner. This means we only have a few decades to act, so we need to concentrate on greenhouse gas reductions that will have an immediate impact. Our short-term climate actions should focus on reducing methane emissions so we can see the quickest benefit.\nCompared to the massive requirements necessary to reduce CO2, cutting methane requires only modest investment. Where we stop methane emissions, cooling follows within a decade, not centuries. That could make the difference for many fragile systems on the brink.\u201d\nBack to Top\nWhy isn\u2019t Zero Waste included on most climate action plans?\nWhen the EPA calculates greenhouse gas emissions from waste for our national GHG inventory, they only look at the emissions from landfills and incinerators. But waste isn\u2019t just what happens after you discarded the product\u2014where are the emissions from all the energy and materials used to extract, process and deliver that product to you?\nFigure 1 (left) shows the traditional sector-based view of GHG emissions found in our national GHG inventory. Waste isn\u2019t even represented on this chart, which means climate action plans are focusing primarily on reducing transportation and electricity emissions. The emissions from the energy and materials used to extract, process and deliver products to you, those products that then become trash, are embedded into categories like electric power, transportation, and industry.\nFigure 2 (right) looks at our emissions from a system-based perspective and shows the way we produce, consume and dispose of our goods and food accounts for 42% of our nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. This means the choices we make about our \u201cstuff\u201d has a bigger impact than driving our car or heating our homes. This new approach is called materials management, and it\u2019s defined by the EPA as \u201chow we manage material resources as they flow through the economy, from extraction of materials and food, production, transport, provision of services, reuse of materials and, if necessary, disposal.\u201d By using this approach to measure our greenhouse gas emissions, we can see the huge impact we can have by recycling more, expanding composting programs, and consuming less. Read the EPA report here.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean reducing energy use, investing in renewable energy, or changing our transportation habits and technologies aren\u2019t critical\u2014they are! We need to reduce all our emissions substantially over the next few decades, but we haven\u2019t been using all the tools we have to do this, and Zero Waste is an especially important tool because methane is such a powerful short-term gas.\nBack to Top\nWaste and climate on the local level\nWhen a local community calculates its greenhouse gas emissions from waste, it uses the First Order Decay (FOD) model for landfills (following IPCC protocol). This model measures only methane emissions that take place within the city limits within a given year. Any greenhouse gas emissions or savings from recycling or composting are not included in this approach, and neither are any emissions that occur outside of the city\u2019s boundaries.\nThe EPA\u2019s Waste Reduction Model (WARM) calculates the lifecycle GHG emissions from how we manage materials, not just how we manage waste. This accounts for the energy savings from recycling and composting, as well as landfill emissions. Using WARM to calculate emissions from materials management shows the substantial climate benefits from recycling and composting.\nHere\u2019s an example of how the two models can give you two different results:\nThe IPCC FOD model tells us metals disposed in a landfill emit 0 tons of methane because they\u2019re not biodegradable. This means:\n--> If you landfilled 100% of your metals, your local community GHG inventory would increase by 0.\n--> If you recycled 100% of your metals, your local community GHG inventory would decrease by 0.\nThe EPA's WARM tells us recycling metals can save greenhouse gas emissions because it takes less energy to make new metal products from recycled metal than it does to use virgin metal. For example, recycling an aluminum can saves 95% of the energy used to make the can. In fact, WARM calculates that recycling 90% of U.S. metals could save 101 million mtCO2e annually, the equivalent to taking 19.3 million cars off the road for a year!\n(Calculated by Eco-Cycle using EPA's \u201cMunicipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States Detailed Tables and Figures for 2008 ,\u201d WARM online calculator version 10 with default landfill gas recovery and distances, and EPA's online Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator .)\nLocal communities are missing the connection between their materials management choices and the climate because they\u2019re focused only on the methane emissions from their local landfill. We all share one climate so emissions anywhere will affect all of us. This means we need to make decisions that reduce the greatest amount of GHG emissions, regardless of whether they occur at our local landfill or in a tropical forest across the globe. Local communities need to use WARM to make the right decisions about materials management so they see the total climate impact of their local actions.\nWhat can you do\n1.

Specify that they include only household refuse. Yard, construction, or chemical wastes are not permitted for safety reasons. Separate bags will be required for plastics, metals, glass, food waste, and miscellaneous. Food waste should placed in large sealable plastic bags. All other materials should be kept in tied trash bags. Precautions must be taken to avoid spillage during transport and handling.\nOn the day of the lab, collections should be delivered to a common site. The best site would be a paved area next to a large school refuse bin.\nStudents should record the mass of each bag. Find the total mass in each category, and the average mass produced per person in each category. After this, dispose of the food waste bags and the miscellaneous bags without opening them. They may represent a health hazard.\nOpen the remaining bags and subdivide their contents. Separate piles of paper can include craft, colored, newsprint, glossy, miscellaneous, and stationery. A separate pile should contain cardboard. Similar divisions can be made to separate different types of metals, plastics (look at the recycling number at the bottom of plastic containers), and colors of glass. Record the mass of each pile. Calculate the mass generated by each person and use this to estimate the total amount of each substance thrown away in your community. After classification, recycle materials that can be recycled and dispose of the rest.\nNote: Activities listed to this point are suitable for all levels of students. The following activities are suitable for higher achieving students.\nDivide the class into research groups. Each group will be responsible for gathering information and articles from periodicals relating to one or more of the refuse categories. Topics for articles should include possibilities and problems involving reuse, recycling, composting, incineration, landfill, or other solutions pertaining to a particular type of refuse. Primary concerns of cost, safety, environmental impact, and energy requirements should be kept in mind. The Readers' Guide to Periodic Literature may be one of the best sources of current information for general readers.\nEach group should make a recommendation for dealing with their category of refuse. This should be based on their own research.\nThe entire group can formulate a plan for dealing with their community's household trash. Plans should include means of paying for the plan. It should also address whether the material should be sorted. In other words, should it be sorted by the persons generating it, or should be sorted in a central collection facility?\nHave each student submit a report about the activity for evaluation by class and teacher. Additional activities may include assigning students to examine disposal problems not addressed by the group. This may include chemical waste, nuclear waste, tires, medical waste.

Additional activities may include assigning students to examine disposal problems not addressed by the group. This may include chemical waste, nuclear waste, tires, medical waste, yard waste, motor oil, batteries, etc.\nStudents may choose to present the results of these studies to local governmental officials and media.\nActivity 2. What is Biodegradability?\nAsk students to bring about 4 cups (approximately one liter) of garden or other soil from an outdoor area. Ask them to bring objects and materials from home that they consider biodegradable or non-biodegradable. Substances may be small pieces of fruit, bread, meat, plastic, paper or cardboard, charcoal, etc.. etc. The soil is then placed in a metal tray or bread pan. The soil should be at least 7 cm deep (2 1/2 inches). Divide the pan into 6 areas, and bury a small piece (about 1 cc) of material in each area. Place a plant label or ice cream stick in each area, telling what material is buried there.\nEvery other day for two weeks, dig up the substance and describe its appearance, smell, etc. How has it changed? Why? What materials show little or no change? Why not?\n(Note: This is a modification of a BSCS Green Version experiment used successfully for many years in high school classrooms.\nAsk students to conduct a survey of their neighborhood supermarkets. Find out if the markets provide information about packaging, biodegradability, and toxicity.\nAsk students to learn about local landfill and waste treatment practices. This can be done by library research, interviewing government officials, and obtaining information from community action groups and service organizations.\nAsk students to interview people who work in various waste management fields. This can include employees of solid waste management companies, sanitary engineers, landfill operators, or managers of recycling companies. Local, state and federal regulatory agency employees, and elected government official could also be interviewed.\nActivity 3 - Pick The Best Package\nObjectives:\nStudents will be able to distinguish between different types of packaging.\nStudents will be able to determine whether packaging can be recycled or not.\nStudent Handout\nGive the students a copy of this survey sheet at the beginning of class and after 10-15 minutes begin discussing their choices using the answer key given.\nWhen you go shopping, if all other considerations are equal, pick a product wrapped in the least amount of packaging. Given the following list try and classify them according to the ratings listed.\na check ( ) means the item can be reused or recycled\na zero (0) means it can be incinerated or landfilled\na minus (-) means it cannot be disposed of easily and should be avoided if at all possible.\nKind of Package\n"}, {"score": 1079.4781, "uuid": "e271d547-bf09-50af-83fd-0a3156cc6a53", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1506wb-64-04938", "target_hostname": "vivbizclub.com", "target_uri": "http://vivbizclub.com/blog/tag/biodegradable/", "page_rank": 1.2917187e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "<em>Biodegradable</em> | Viv Biz Club - Up to 80% off Eco.", "snippet": "Let\u2019s talk about it in <em>the</em> context of <em>the</em> new generation of eco-friendly plastics.

I could see it not working with things like compostable cutlery which have a longer biodegradation cycle, but bagasse products break down quite quickly and in the right amounts it may work with Bokashi.\nObviously, composting the products is ideal and if you can do #1 or #2, fantastic. If not, there are still quite a number of benefits to using compostable products, which I think are pretty powerful.

It is set within the wider context of the UK Government's planned increased levels of AD and should be read in conjunction with CIWEM's PPSs on Wastewater Biosolids Treatment and Use [i] .\nCIWEM calls for:\nA consistent and proportionate approach to policy for the production and use of biogas irrespective of feedstock.

Members in 98 countries include scientists, engineers, ecologists and students.\nContext\nAnaerobic digestion is a long-established technology for the treatment of sewage sludge by the water industry. The technology is of increasing interest to the waste management industry and to farmers.\u00a0 DECC is promoting AD as a technology for renewable energy and Defra for more sustainable waste management.\u00a0 AD produces multiple benefits including a source of renewable energy in the form of biogas (which can either be burnt to generate heat and electricity in combined heat and power units or upgraded to biomethane and injected into the gas distribution grid or used for vehicle fuel). Digestate from the process can be used as a useful fertiliser and soil conditioner for agriculture and other land use applications.\u00a0 In addition, the recycling of digestate in this way diverts biodegradable waste from landfill.\nDefra [ii] highlights significant potential for future AD capacity on the basis of over 100 million tonnes of organic waste currently being produced in the UK annually, comprising:\n12-20 million tonnes of food waste (approximately half of which is municipal waste collected by local authorities, the rest being hotel or food manufacturing waste);\n90 million tonnes of agricultural material such as manure and slurry;\n1.73 million dry tonnes of sewage sludge.\nThe UK Government has set a target of expanding AD capacity significantly and hopes to see the UK as a world leader in anaerobic digestion by 2020.\u00a0 Given the level of expertise on AD within water companies, Defra regards this industry as being central to the expansion of AD, thus the question of the ability to feasibly co-digest sewage sludge with biodegradable waste is being increasingly considered.\nThere are a number of targets for 2020 which help to drive the high priority now attached to AD by the UK Government. Under the Climate Change Act 2008 [iii] greenhouse gas emissions should be at least 34% below the 1990 baseline.\u00a0 In addition, the EU Renewable Energy Directive [iv] requires 15% of UK's energy to be generated from renewable sources. The 2009 Low Carbon Transition Plan [v] and UK Renewable Energy Strategy [vi] as well as the UK Biomass Strategy [vii] and Waste Strategy for England [viii] (both 2007) also encourage wider use of AD, including co-digestion.\u00a0 Production of biogas by AD is also eligible for Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs), although there are different rates for biogas produced from anaerobically digested sewage sludge (which is regarded as an established technology that receives 0.5 ROCs/ MWh) and biodegradable solid waste (which receives 2.0 ROCs per MWh [and 3 or 4 ROCs depending on output in Northern Ireland]). The banding of ROCs is due to be reviewed in 2011.\u00a0 The water industry does not receive support for electricity generated under the Feed-in Tariff scheme, though it will qualify for the Renewable Heat Incentive when this is introduced in 2011.\nIn addition, there is an ongoing driver, in the form of the EU Landfill Directive, to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill.\u00a0 By 2020 only 35% of the amount produced in 1990 will be able to be disposed of this way.\u00a0\u00a0 Between 12 and 20 million wet tonnes of food waste produced are produced in the UK per year, much of which would be suitable for AD and at typical generation efficiencies, could potentially be used to generate upwards of 6TWh of electricity (roughly 1.7% of UK annual consumption).\nWater and sewerage companies are presently responsible for by far the largest inventory of AD infrastructure.\u00a0 Where any spare (headroom) capacity exists, CIWEM considers that it would be in the country's and the environment's interests to use this for co-digestion.\u00a0 If the existing capacity is fully utilised it could be 'turbo-charged' by retrofitting advanced digestion, alternatively additional digesters could be built.\u00a0 All of these options use the existing expertise, grid connections, vehicle handling and onsite capacity to treat associated effluent.\u00a0\u00a0 A logical means of increasing such output may be to co-digest sewage sludge with biodegradable material (e.g. energy crop, manure or liquid waste) of an appropriate quality.\nCo-digestion describes the process during which a number of different waste types are mixed together and anaerobically digested.\u00a0 This process can have clear benefits, firstly in improving the ability to digest certain difficult to digest waste types, and also, in the case of sewage sludge, adding to the existing calorific value thus increasing the biogas output of the digestion process.\u00a0 Importantly, in some locations it can result in the critical mass of biogas substrate to be realised within a haulage distance that makes AD financially viable.\nMany biodegradable wastes are co-digested (e.g. farmyard manure plus municipal waste, food waste plus energy crops, etc.) but as they all fall under a common regulatory framework, the main obstacles relate to issues including demographics, investment potential and feedstock suitability if AD is to be expanded significantly as a waste treatment technique.\nIn the case of co-digesting sewage sludge (biosolids) with other wastes (which is practiced in other countries including Denmark and Germany) the UK has created additional complications by utilising different regulatory regimes, which presently appear quite difficult to reconcile, or which in order to satisfy, impose economic burdens of such significance that they make such co-digestion financially unattractive.\nDiscussion of Key Issues\nGovernment targets\nThe UK Government sees AD as a viable source of renewable fuel in the form of biogas, both for upgrading to biomethane for injection into the grid or vehicle fuel and to generate electricity.\u00a0 In addition, AD represents a means to divert significant amounts of biodegradable waste away from landfill provided an appropriate digestate recycling route is available. Thus, it can contribute to meeting targets set under the Landfill Directive (it must be emphasised that an appropriate recycling route is essential for this diversion to be achieved - otherwise AD outputs can result in a greater volume of waste produced than existed initially because the waste has to be diluted before digestion).\u00a0 Digestate also constitutes a useful source of nutrients for recycling back to land.\u00a0 This context is likely to see increased AD capacity in the UK in coming years, and the Government has stated that it wishes the UK to become a world leader in the technology.\nA major attraction of co-digestion for the water industry is its potential to make more use of existing AD assets and headroom digester capacity, to optimise biogas output and help water companies meet their own targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency compliance.\u00a0 It may be argued that co-digestion will not make any difference to the country's targets for greenhouse gas reduction, landfill diversion or renewable energy, because the feedstock employed in co-digestion would be exploited by one of the many new digesters under construction or planned.\u00a0 In addition, the tonnage of sewage sludge which could be treated by AD (and thus co-digestion) is very limited compared to the theoretical feedstock volumes available from other sources.\u00a0 However this neglects some very significant issues: sewage works' AD has on-site treatment for reject water, they have grid connections and good road access, they have expertise to operate AD and combined heat and power and they have 24-hour surveillance monitoring.\u00a0 Defra envisages \"The water industry will be at the hub of a national anaerobic digestion infrastructure. Where appropriate, water companies will generate additional renewable energy by using their spare capacity to process other feedstocks such as food waste.\" [ix]\nRegulatory issues\nThe contribution to Government targets that can be made from co-digestion of waste is limited under current circumstances.\u00a0 The majority of existing AD capacity is operated by water and sewerage companies and whilst a number are now examining the potential to utilise their spare digester capacity by co-digesting sewage sludge with other biodegradable wastes, there are a number of regulatory barriers that prevent this potential from being realised.\nThe digestate produced from sewage sludge is currently controlled under the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations [x] which govern how it can be applied to agricultural land.\u00a0 If appropriately produced and managed (in accordance with the regulations), such digestate represents a safe and inexpensive alternative to inorganic fertiliser for farmers and a viable route for water companies as well as a sustainable way of recycling nutrients to land.\u00a0 These regulations only apply to agricultural use of digestate; non-agricultural use is still governed by the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 [xi] .\u00a0 But there is nothing in the Sludge Directive that would prevent it from being relevant to all land application, provided there was separate accounting for use in agriculture [xii] .\nDigestate from source-segregated biodegradable waste is controlled under the Environmental Permitting Regulations and its production may also be subject to requirements under the Animal By-Products Regulations (ABPR) [xiii] .\u00a0 Spreading to agricultural land requires an environmental permit or appropriate exemption for certain waste types.\u00a0 However, this too could be appropriately managed under the tried and tested sludge Regulations.\u00a0 Alternatively, an output produced adhering to the requirements of approved quality protocols for compost or anaerobic digestate (e.g. PAS 100 and PAS 110) may be classified as a non-waste for re-use and not be subject to waste regulation control.\nIf sewage sludge is co-digested with biodegradable waste, it might no longer fall under the scope of the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations and thus outside of the scope of the Environmental Permitting Regulations.\u00a0 Consequently a potentially expensive environmental permit may also be required of the farmer in order for him to apply the resultant digestate to land.\u00a0 Co-digestate is also presently not covered by any of the approved quality protocols which also remove the output from the regulatory regime for waste and in order for it to be covered there will need to be clarity on how it could meet the requirements of Article 6 of the EU Waste Framework Directive on End of Waste Criteria.\u00a0 Also, additional pre-treatment of the feedstock may be required to meet the requirements of the ABPR.\u00a0 Currently, this has the effect of making co-digestion unattractively complex and expensive, even in locations where there may be a locally available, secure supply of feedstock of sufficiently high quality. Under its Anaerobic Digestion Implementation Plan, Defra has committed to identify the regulatory requirements for co-digestion of sewage sludge with other feedstocks [xiv] .\nInvestment issues\nIf water companies are to be encouraged to invest in AD of waste, and co-digestion, there will need to be consideration as to how companies can receive solid waste from producers, which are outside their regulated customer base (with waste collection being paid for via council taxes), utilise this to optimise biogas production and reinvest the proceeds back into the regulated business (which is funded through water bills).\u00a0 Waste operators will also demand a level playing field so that \u00a0they are not at a competitive disadvantage to water companies, who may be (or perceived to be) in a monopolistic position. Water companies could theoretically make use of secure sources of funding (from water bills) to develop digester capacity to treat waste.\u00a0 Spare capacity being sold for commercial feed stocks could seriously distort local market conditions, with below market prices being used to secure feed stocks.\u00a0 An option might be that the construction and/or operation of digesters at wastewater treatment works is opened up to the commercial market; waste companies may or may not be in a better position to deliver value for money through this approach, which could result in lower operating cost and perhaps ultimately a lower charge to the water company customer.\nArriving at an appropriate financial framework will require collaboration between OFWAT and other industry regulators and OFWAT has sought guidance from the Office of Fair Trading for its view on how to fairly regulate this issue. Water companies will require a good financial model in order to determine a gate fee for waste, which recognises: the income from the energy (and possibly digestate disposal to land); the additional costs for handling the waste and a contribution to the asset value that has been paid for by the customer and thus should be recompensed).\u00a0 OFWAT have made it clear that if the financial model is robust, they will not stand in the way of co-digestion.\nAn important attraction of utilising existing water company capacity is that they also have the assets and supply chains to recycle the digestate. Without economic digestate recycling routes, new digesters will struggle.\u00a0 Digestate is produced at 4% dry solids and is thus expensive to transport.\u00a0 It must therefore be dewatered to at least 20% dry solids.\u00a0 Dewatering liquor must then be treated as it contains soluble N and P and some organic matter.\u00a0 Water Companies have dewatering facilities and a sewage treatment plant to put the liquor back through (nutrient recovery as struvite and ammonia is emerging technology, which is an added environmental advantage).\nPrices for both energy and fertiliser are likely to increase in the medium to long-term.\u00a0 Both biogas and fertiliser outputs from AD represent more sustainable sources of these valuable resources than fossil fuels and inorganic fertilisers, the prices for which will become increasingly expensive by comparison.\nThe allocation of Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) vary considerably for sewage and biowaste (energy generated from digested sewage sludge qualifies for 0.5 ROCs per MWh of electricity generated) whereas that generated from biowaste qualifies for 2 ROCs per MWh, making the allocation of ROCs for mixed feedstock problematic.\u00a0 The Renewable Heat Incentive provides 6.5p/kWh, guaranteed until 2035 for eligible schemes where electricity is generated using CHP units.\nDemographic issues\nThe benefits of existing AD capacity near to urban centres and potential recycling routes for digestate are significant if the regulatory hurdles can be overcome.\u00a0 It should be possible to remove these hurdles, and importantly with no diminution in environmental protection. Co-digestion of waste with sewage sludge at existing wastewater treatment works (which are located close to the major conurbations they serve and hence a ready supply of biodegradable waste feedstock) offers an opportunity to achieve financial viability for AD whilst reducing waste transportation requirements (lowering the carbon intensity of the collection/transportation process). For example, for sewage sludge AD to be financially viable requires about 100,000 population, as does food waste AD. Co-digestion would be viable for a town of 50,000 people but mono-digestion would not and wastes would have to travel to a centralised site with the associated transport carbon emissions. The water industry has a significant experience base on AD, and to a lesser extent in relation to co-digestion.\nFeedstock issues\nThere are a number of waste streams that can be anaerobically digested, particularly domestic and commercial food wastes, and commercial and industrial tankered wastes.\u00a0 The main issues concern the quality of the feedstock and the ability to separate contaminants, which can negatively affect digester efficiency, even if present in relatively small amounts.\u00a0 Quality control of feedstock is thus important, and becomes particularly relevant in the case of source-segregated municipal solid waste where contaminants are commonly found. \u00a0\u00a0The revised Waste Framework Directive (WFD) may deliver improvements in the segregation of waste which may improve feedstock quality issues.\u00a0 A sister Biowaste Directive could also be forthcoming, which may help to ease the regulation of co-digestion.\nThe Animal By Products Regulations (ABPR) [xv] also have important implications for co-digestion because of the proportion of other materials introduced into sewage works AD plant, which may contain meat or other waste animal material.\u00a0 Generally the presence of such material in the feedstock requires heat treatment prior to the digestion process. Defra has been working with Water UK to provide guidance to water industry operators on the requirements of these Regulations including at what point and in what proportions pasteurized ABPR waste can be blended with sewage sludge. Advanced digestion would meet ABPR requirements and would have the benefit of trebling the capacity of many existing digesters.\u00a0 If this treatment were applied to all co-digestion feed then the output would be classified as enhanced treated digestate under the Safe Sludge Matrix [xvi] , but depending on the detail of any agreement, this may not be required.\nJune 2011\nNote: CIWEM Policy Position Statements (PPS) represent the Institution's views on issues at a particular point in time.

Members in 98 countries include scientists, engineers, ecologists and students.\nContext\nAnaerobic digestion is a long-established technology for the treatment of sewage sludge by the water industry. The technology is of increasing interest to the waste management industry and to farmers.\u00a0 DECC is promoting AD as a technology for renewable energy and Defra for more sustainable waste management.\u00a0 AD produces multiple benefits including a source of renewable energy in the form of biogas (which can either be burnt to generate heat and electricity in combined heat and power units or upgraded to biomethane and injected into the gas distribution grid or used for vehicle fuel). Digestate from the process can be used as a useful fertiliser and soil conditioner for agriculture and other land use applications.\u00a0 In addition, the recycling of digestate in this way diverts biodegradable waste from landfill.\nDefra [ii] highlights significant potential for future AD capacity on the basis of over 100 million tonnes of organic waste currently being produced in the UK annually, comprising:\n12-20 million tonnes of food waste (approximately half of which is municipal waste collected by local authorities, the rest being hotel or food manufacturing waste);\n90 million tonnes of agricultural material such as manure and slurry;\n1.73 million dry tonnes of sewage sludge.\nThe UK Government has set a target of expanding AD capacity significantly and hopes to see the UK as a world leader in anaerobic digestion by 2020.\u00a0 Given the level of expertise on AD within water companies, Defra regards this industry as being central to the expansion of AD, thus the question of the ability to feasibly co-digest sewage sludge with biodegradable waste is being increasingly considered.\nThere are a number of targets for 2020 which help to drive the high priority now attached to AD by the UK Government. Under the Climate Change Act 2008 [iii] greenhouse gas emissions should be at least 34% below the 1990 baseline.\u00a0 In addition, the EU Renewable Energy Directive [iv] requires 15% of UK's energy to be generated from renewable sources. The 2009 Low Carbon Transition Plan [v] and UK Renewable Energy Strategy [vi] as well as the UK Biomass Strategy [vii] and Waste Strategy for England [viii] (both 2007) also encourage wider use of AD, including co-digestion.\u00a0 Production of biogas by AD is also eligible for Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs), although there are different rates for biogas produced from anaerobically digested sewage sludge (which is regarded as an established technology that receives 0.5 ROCs/ MWh) and biodegradable solid waste (which receives 2.0 ROCs per MWh [and 3 or 4 ROCs depending on output in Northern Ireland]). The banding of ROCs is due to be reviewed in 2011.\u00a0 The water industry does not receive support for electricity generated under the Feed-in Tariff scheme, though it will qualify for the Renewable Heat Incentive when this is introduced in 2011.\nIn addition, there is an ongoing driver, in the form of the EU Landfill Directive, to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill.\u00a0 By 2020 only 35% of the amount produced in 1990 will be able to be disposed of this way.\u00a0\u00a0 Between 12 and 20 million wet tonnes of food waste produced are produced in the UK per year, much of which would be suitable for AD and at typical generation efficiencies, could potentially be used to generate upwards of 6TWh of electricity (roughly 1.7% of UK annual consumption).\nWater and sewerage companies are presently responsible for by far the largest inventory of AD infrastructure.\u00a0 Where any spare (headroom) capacity exists, CIWEM considers that it would be in the country's and the environment's interests to use this for co-digestion.\u00a0 If the existing capacity is fully utilised it could be 'turbo-charged' by retrofitting advanced digestion, alternatively additional digesters could be built.\u00a0 All of these options use the existing expertise, grid connections, vehicle handling and onsite capacity to treat associated effluent.\u00a0\u00a0 A logical means of increasing such output may be to co-digest sewage sludge with biodegradable material (e.g. energy crop, manure or liquid waste) of an appropriate quality.\nCo-digestion describes the process during which a number of different waste types are mixed together and anaerobically digested.\u00a0 This process can have clear benefits, firstly in improving the ability to digest certain difficult to digest waste types, and also, in the case of sewage sludge, adding to the existing calorific value thus increasing the biogas output of the digestion process.\u00a0 Importantly, in some locations it can result in the critical mass of biogas substrate to be realised within a haulage distance that makes AD financially viable.\nMany biodegradable wastes are co-digested (e.g. farmyard manure plus municipal waste, food waste plus energy crops, etc.) but as they all fall under a common regulatory framework, the main obstacles relate to issues including demographics, investment potential and feedstock suitability if AD is to be expanded significantly as a waste treatment technique.\nIn the case of co-digesting sewage sludge (biosolids) with other wastes (which is practiced in other countries including Denmark and Germany) the UK has created additional complications by utilising different regulatory regimes, which presently appear quite difficult to reconcile, or which in order to satisfy, impose economic burdens of such significance that they make such co-digestion financially unattractive.\nDiscussion of Key Issues\nGovernment targets\nThe UK Government sees AD as a viable source of renewable fuel in the form of biogas, both for upgrading to biomethane for injection into the grid or vehicle fuel and to generate electricity.\u00a0 In addition, AD represents a means to divert significant amounts of biodegradable waste away from landfill provided an appropriate digestate recycling route is available. Thus, it can contribute to meeting targets set under the Landfill Directive (it must be emphasised that an appropriate recycling route is essential for this diversion to be achieved - otherwise AD outputs can result in a greater volume of waste produced than existed initially because the waste has to be diluted before digestion).\u00a0 Digestate also constitutes a useful source of nutrients for recycling back to land.\u00a0 This context is likely to see increased AD capacity in the UK in coming years, and the Government has stated that it wishes the UK to become a world leader in the technology.\nA major attraction of co-digestion for the water industry is its potential to make more use of existing AD assets and headroom digester capacity, to optimise biogas output and help water companies meet their own targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency compliance.\u00a0 It may be argued that co-digestion will not make any difference to the country's targets for greenhouse gas reduction, landfill diversion or renewable energy, because the feedstock employed in co-digestion would be exploited by one of the many new digesters under construction or planned.\u00a0 In addition, the tonnage of sewage sludge which could be treated by AD (and thus co-digestion) is very limited compared to the theoretical feedstock volumes available from other sources.\u00a0 However this neglects some very significant issues: sewage works' AD has on-site treatment for reject water, they have grid connections and good road access, they have expertise to operate AD and combined heat and power and they have 24-hour surveillance monitoring.\u00a0 Defra envisages \"The water industry will be at the hub of a national anaerobic digestion infrastructure. Where appropriate, water companies will generate additional renewable energy by using their spare capacity to process other feedstocks such as food waste.\" [ix]\nRegulatory issues\nThe contribution to Government targets that can be made from co-digestion of waste is limited under current circumstances.\u00a0 The majority of existing AD capacity is operated by water and sewerage companies and whilst a number are now examining the potential to utilise their spare digester capacity by co-digesting sewage sludge with other biodegradable wastes, there are a number of regulatory barriers that prevent this potential from being realised.\nThe digestate produced from sewage sludge is currently controlled under the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations [x] which govern how it can be applied to agricultural land.\u00a0 If appropriately produced and managed (in accordance with the regulations), such digestate represents a safe and inexpensive alternative to inorganic fertiliser for farmers and a viable route for water companies as well as a sustainable way of recycling nutrients to land.\u00a0 These regulations only apply to agricultural use of digestate; non-agricultural use is still governed by the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 [xi] .\u00a0 But there is nothing in the Sludge Directive that would prevent it from being relevant to all land application, provided there was separate accounting for use in agriculture [xii] .\nDigestate from source-segregated biodegradable waste is controlled under the Environmental Permitting Regulations and its production may also be subject to requirements under the Animal By-Products Regulations (ABPR) [xiii] .\u00a0 Spreading to agricultural land requires an environmental permit or appropriate exemption for certain waste types.\u00a0 However, this too could be appropriately managed under the tried and tested sludge Regulations.\u00a0 Alternatively, an output produced adhering to the requirements of approved quality protocols for compost or anaerobic digestate (e.g. PAS 100 and PAS 110) may be classified as a non-waste for re-use and not be subject to waste regulation control.\nIf sewage sludge is co-digested with biodegradable waste, it might no longer fall under the scope of the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations and thus outside of the scope of the Environmental Permitting Regulations.\u00a0 Consequently a potentially expensive environmental permit may also be required of the farmer in order for him to apply the resultant digestate to land.\u00a0 Co-digestate is also presently not covered by any of the approved quality protocols which also remove the output from the regulatory regime for waste and in order for it to be covered there will need to be clarity on how it could meet the requirements of Article 6 of the EU Waste Framework Directive on End of Waste Criteria.\u00a0 Also, additional pre-treatment of the feedstock may be required to meet the requirements of the ABPR.\u00a0 Currently, this has the effect of making co-digestion unattractively complex and expensive, even in locations where there may be a locally available, secure supply of feedstock of sufficiently high quality. Under its Anaerobic Digestion Implementation Plan, Defra has committed to identify the regulatory requirements for co-digestion of sewage sludge with other feedstocks [xiv] .\nInvestment issues\nIf water companies are to be encouraged to invest in AD of waste, and co-digestion, there will need to be consideration as to how companies can receive solid waste from producers, which are outside their regulated customer base (with waste collection being paid for via council taxes), utilise this to optimise biogas production and reinvest the proceeds back into the regulated business (which is funded through water bills).\u00a0 Waste operators will also demand a level playing field so that \u00a0they are not at a competitive disadvantage to water companies, who may be (or perceived to be) in a monopolistic position. Water companies could theoretically make use of secure sources of funding (from water bills) to develop digester capacity to treat waste.\u00a0 Spare capacity being sold for commercial feed stocks could seriously distort local market conditions, with below market prices being used to secure feed stocks.\u00a0 An option might be that the construction and/or operation of digesters at wastewater treatment works is opened up to the commercial market; waste companies may or may not be in a better position to deliver value for money through this approach, which could result in lower operating cost and perhaps ultimately a lower charge to the water company customer.\nArriving at an appropriate financial framework will require collaboration between OFWAT and other industry regulators and OFWAT has sought guidance from the Office of Fair Trading for its view on how to fairly regulate this issue. Water companies will require a good financial model in order to determine a gate fee for waste, which recognises: the income from the energy (and possibly digestate disposal to land); the additional costs for handling the waste and a contribution to the asset value that has been paid for by the customer and thus should be recompensed).\u00a0 OFWAT have made it clear that if the financial model is robust, they will not stand in the way of co-digestion.\nAn important attraction of utilising existing water company capacity is that they also have the assets and supply chains to recycle the digestate. Without economic digestate recycling routes, new digesters will struggle.\u00a0 Digestate is produced at 4% dry solids and is thus expensive to transport.\u00a0 It must therefore be dewatered to at least 20% dry solids.\u00a0 Dewatering liquor must then be treated as it contains soluble N and P and some organic matter.\u00a0 Water Companies have dewatering facilities and a sewage treatment plant to put the liquor back through (nutrient recovery as struvite and ammonia is emerging technology, which is an added environmental advantage).\nPrices for both energy and fertiliser are likely to increase in the medium to long-term.\u00a0 Both biogas and fertiliser outputs from AD represent more sustainable sources of these valuable resources than fossil fuels and inorganic fertilisers, the prices for which will become increasingly expensive by comparison.\nThe allocation of Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) vary considerably for sewage and biowaste (energy generated from digested sewage sludge qualifies for 0.5 ROCs per MWh of electricity generated) whereas that generated from biowaste qualifies for 2 ROCs per MWh, making the allocation of ROCs for mixed feedstock problematic.\u00a0 The Renewable Heat Incentive provides 6.5p/kWh, guaranteed until 2035 for eligible schemes where electricity is generated using CHP units.\nDemographic issues\nThe benefits of existing AD capacity near to urban centres and potential recycling routes for digestate are significant if the regulatory hurdles can be overcome.\u00a0 It should be possible to remove these hurdles, and importantly with no diminution in environmental protection. Co-digestion of waste with sewage sludge at existing wastewater treatment works (which are located close to the major conurbations they serve and hence a ready supply of biodegradable waste feedstock) offers an opportunity to achieve financial viability for AD whilst reducing waste transportation requirements (lowering the carbon intensity of the collection/transportation process). For example, for sewage sludge AD to be financially viable requires about 100,000 population, as does food waste AD. Co-digestion would be viable for a town of 50,000 people but mono-digestion would not and wastes would have to travel to a centralised site with the associated transport carbon emissions. The water industry has a significant experience base on AD, and to a lesser extent in relation to co-digestion.\nFeedstock issues\nThere are a number of waste streams that can be anaerobically digested, particularly domestic and commercial food wastes, and commercial and industrial tankered wastes.\u00a0 The main issues concern the quality of the feedstock and the ability to separate contaminants, which can negatively affect digester efficiency, even if present in relatively small amounts.\u00a0 Quality control of feedstock is thus important, and becomes particularly relevant in the case of source-segregated municipal solid waste where contaminants are commonly found. \u00a0\u00a0The revised Waste Framework Directive (WFD) may deliver improvements in the segregation of waste which may improve feedstock quality issues.\u00a0 A sister Biowaste Directive could also be forthcoming, which may help to ease the regulation of co-digestion.\nThe Animal By Products Regulations (ABPR) [xv] also have important implications for co-digestion because of the proportion of other materials introduced into sewage works AD plant, which may contain meat or other waste animal material.\u00a0 Generally the presence of such material in the feedstock requires heat treatment prior to the digestion process. Defra has been working with Water UK to provide guidance to water industry operators on the requirements of these Regulations including at what point and in what proportions pasteurized ABPR waste can be blended with sewage sludge. Advanced digestion would meet ABPR requirements and would have the benefit of trebling the capacity of many existing digesters.\u00a0 If this treatment were applied to all co-digestion feed then the output would be classified as enhanced treated digestate under the Safe Sludge Matrix [xvi] , but depending on the detail of any agreement, this may not be required.\nJune 2011\nNote: CIWEM Policy Position Statements (PPS) represent the Institution's views on issues at a particular point in time.

Members in 98 countries include scientists, engineers, ecologists and students.\nContext\nAnaerobic digestion is a long-established technology for the treatment of sewage sludge by the water industry. The technology is of increasing interest to the waste management industry and to farmers.\u00a0 DECC is promoting AD as a technology for renewable energy and Defra for more sustainable waste management.\u00a0 AD produces multiple benefits including a source of renewable energy in the form of biogas (which can either be burnt to generate heat and electricity in combined heat and power units or upgraded to biomethane and injected into the gas distribution grid or used for vehicle fuel). Digestate from the process can be used as a useful fertiliser and soil conditioner for agriculture and other land use applications.\u00a0 In addition, the recycling of digestate in this way diverts biodegradable waste from landfill.\nDefra [ii] highlights significant potential for future AD capacity on the basis of over 100 million tonnes of organic waste currently being produced in the UK annually, comprising:\n12-20 million tonnes of food waste (approximately half of which is municipal waste collected by local authorities, the rest being hotel or food manufacturing waste);\n90 million tonnes of agricultural material such as manure and slurry;\n1.73 million dry tonnes of sewage sludge.\nThe UK Government has set a target of expanding AD capacity significantly and hopes to see the UK as a world leader in anaerobic digestion by 2020.\u00a0 Given the level of expertise on AD within water companies, Defra regards this industry as being central to the expansion of AD, thus the question of the ability to feasibly co-digest sewage sludge with biodegradable waste is being increasingly considered.\nThere are a number of targets for 2020 which help to drive the high priority now attached to AD by the UK Government. Under the Climate Change Act 2008 [iii] greenhouse gas emissions should be at least 34% below the 1990 baseline.\u00a0 In addition, the EU Renewable Energy Directive [iv] requires 15% of UK's energy to be generated from renewable sources. The 2009 Low Carbon Transition Plan [v] and UK Renewable Energy Strategy [vi] as well as the UK Biomass Strategy [vii] and Waste Strategy for England [viii] (both 2007) also encourage wider use of AD, including co-digestion.\u00a0 Production of biogas by AD is also eligible for Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs), although there are different rates for biogas produced from anaerobically digested sewage sludge (which is regarded as an established technology that receives 0.5 ROCs/ MWh) and biodegradable solid waste (which receives 2.0 ROCs per MWh [and 3 or 4 ROCs depending on output in Northern Ireland]). The banding of ROCs is due to be reviewed in 2011.\u00a0 The water industry does not receive support for electricity generated under the Feed-in Tariff scheme, though it will qualify for the Renewable Heat Incentive when this is introduced in 2011.\nIn addition, there is an ongoing driver, in the form of the EU Landfill Directive, to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill.\u00a0 By 2020 only 35% of the amount produced in 1990 will be able to be disposed of this way.\u00a0\u00a0 Between 12 and 20 million wet tonnes of food waste produced are produced in the UK per year, much of which would be suitable for AD and at typical generation efficiencies, could potentially be used to generate upwards of 6TWh of electricity (roughly 1.7% of UK annual consumption).\nWater and sewerage companies are presently responsible for by far the largest inventory of AD infrastructure.\u00a0 Where any spare (headroom) capacity exists, CIWEM considers that it would be in the country's and the environment's interests to use this for co-digestion.\u00a0 If the existing capacity is fully utilised it could be 'turbo-charged' by retrofitting advanced digestion, alternatively additional digesters could be built.\u00a0 All of these options use the existing expertise, grid connections, vehicle handling and onsite capacity to treat associated effluent.\u00a0\u00a0 A logical means of increasing such output may be to co-digest sewage sludge with biodegradable material (e.g. energy crop, manure or liquid waste) of an appropriate quality.\nCo-digestion describes the process during which a number of different waste types are mixed together and anaerobically digested.\u00a0 This process can have clear benefits, firstly in improving the ability to digest certain difficult to digest waste types, and also, in the case of sewage sludge, adding to the existing calorific value thus increasing the biogas output of the digestion process.\u00a0 Importantly, in some locations it can result in the critical mass of biogas substrate to be realised within a haulage distance that makes AD financially viable.\nMany biodegradable wastes are co-digested (e.g. farmyard manure plus municipal waste, food waste plus energy crops, etc.) but as they all fall under a common regulatory framework, the main obstacles relate to issues including demographics, investment potential and feedstock suitability if AD is to be expanded significantly as a waste treatment technique.\nIn the case of co-digesting sewage sludge (biosolids) with other wastes (which is practiced in other countries including Denmark and Germany) the UK has created additional complications by utilising different regulatory regimes, which presently appear quite difficult to reconcile, or which in order to satisfy, impose economic burdens of such significance that they make such co-digestion financially unattractive.\nDiscussion of Key Issues\nGovernment targets\nThe UK Government sees AD as a viable source of renewable fuel in the form of biogas, both for upgrading to biomethane for injection into the grid or vehicle fuel and to generate electricity.\u00a0 In addition, AD represents a means to divert significant amounts of biodegradable waste away from landfill provided an appropriate digestate recycling route is available. Thus, it can contribute to meeting targets set under the Landfill Directive (it must be emphasised that an appropriate recycling route is essential for this diversion to be achieved - otherwise AD outputs can result in a greater volume of waste produced than existed initially because the waste has to be diluted before digestion).\u00a0 Digestate also constitutes a useful source of nutrients for recycling back to land.\u00a0 This context is likely to see increased AD capacity in the UK in coming years, and the Government has stated that it wishes the UK to become a world leader in the technology.\nA major attraction of co-digestion for the water industry is its potential to make more use of existing AD assets and headroom digester capacity, to optimise biogas output and help water companies meet their own targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency compliance.\u00a0 It may be argued that co-digestion will not make any difference to the country's targets for greenhouse gas reduction, landfill diversion or renewable energy, because the feedstock employed in co-digestion would be exploited by one of the many new digesters under construction or planned.\u00a0 In addition, the tonnage of sewage sludge which could be treated by AD (and thus co-digestion) is very limited compared to the theoretical feedstock volumes available from other sources.\u00a0 However this neglects some very significant issues: sewage works' AD has on-site treatment for reject water, they have grid connections and good road access, they have expertise to operate AD and combined heat and power and they have 24-hour surveillance monitoring.\u00a0 Defra envisages \"The water industry will be at the hub of a national anaerobic digestion infrastructure. Where appropriate, water companies will generate additional renewable energy by using their spare capacity to process other feedstocks such as food waste.\" [ix]\nRegulatory issues\nThe contribution to Government targets that can be made from co-digestion of waste is limited under current circumstances.\u00a0 The majority of existing AD capacity is operated by water and sewerage companies and whilst a number are now examining the potential to utilise their spare digester capacity by co-digesting sewage sludge with other biodegradable wastes, there are a number of regulatory barriers that prevent this potential from being realised.\nThe digestate produced from sewage sludge is currently controlled under the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations [x] which govern how it can be applied to agricultural land.\u00a0 If appropriately produced and managed (in accordance with the regulations), such digestate represents a safe and inexpensive alternative to inorganic fertiliser for farmers and a viable route for water companies as well as a sustainable way of recycling nutrients to land.\u00a0 These regulations only apply to agricultural use of digestate; non-agricultural use is still governed by the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 [xi] .\u00a0 But there is nothing in the Sludge Directive that would prevent it from being relevant to all land application, provided there was separate accounting for use in agriculture [xii] .\nDigestate from source-segregated biodegradable waste is controlled under the Environmental Permitting Regulations and its production may also be subject to requirements under the Animal By-Products Regulations (ABPR) [xiii] .\u00a0 Spreading to agricultural land requires an environmental permit or appropriate exemption for certain waste types.\u00a0 However, this too could be appropriately managed under the tried and tested sludge Regulations.\u00a0 Alternatively, an output produced adhering to the requirements of approved quality protocols for compost or anaerobic digestate (e.g. PAS 100 and PAS 110) may be classified as a non-waste for re-use and not be subject to waste regulation control.\nIf sewage sludge is co-digested with biodegradable waste, it might no longer fall under the scope of the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations and thus outside of the scope of the Environmental Permitting Regulations.\u00a0 Consequently a potentially expensive environmental permit may also be required of the farmer in order for him to apply the resultant digestate to land.\u00a0 Co-digestate is also presently not covered by any of the approved quality protocols which also remove the output from the regulatory regime for waste and in order for it to be covered there will need to be clarity on how it could meet the requirements of Article 6 of the EU Waste Framework Directive on End of Waste Criteria.\u00a0 Also, additional pre-treatment of the feedstock may be required to meet the requirements of the ABPR.\u00a0 Currently, this has the effect of making co-digestion unattractively complex and expensive, even in locations where there may be a locally available, secure supply of feedstock of sufficiently high quality. Under its Anaerobic Digestion Implementation Plan, Defra has committed to identify the regulatory requirements for co-digestion of sewage sludge with other feedstocks [xiv] .\nInvestment issues\nIf water companies are to be encouraged to invest in AD of waste, and co-digestion, there will need to be consideration as to how companies can receive solid waste from producers, which are outside their regulated customer base (with waste collection being paid for via council taxes), utilise this to optimise biogas production and reinvest the proceeds back into the regulated business (which is funded through water bills).\u00a0 Waste operators will also demand a level playing field so that \u00a0they are not at a competitive disadvantage to water companies, who may be (or perceived to be) in a monopolistic position. Water companies could theoretically make use of secure sources of funding (from water bills) to develop digester capacity to treat waste.\u00a0 Spare capacity being sold for commercial feed stocks could seriously distort local market conditions, with below market prices being used to secure feed stocks.\u00a0 An option might be that the construction and/or operation of digesters at wastewater treatment works is opened up to the commercial market; waste companies may or may not be in a better position to deliver value for money through this approach, which could result in lower operating cost and perhaps ultimately a lower charge to the water company customer.\nArriving at an appropriate financial framework will require collaboration between OFWAT and other industry regulators and OFWAT has sought guidance from the Office of Fair Trading for its view on how to fairly regulate this issue. Water companies will require a good financial model in order to determine a gate fee for waste, which recognises: the income from the energy (and possibly digestate disposal to land); the additional costs for handling the waste and a contribution to the asset value that has been paid for by the customer and thus should be recompensed).\u00a0 OFWAT have made it clear that if the financial model is robust, they will not stand in the way of co-digestion.\nAn important attraction of utilising existing water company capacity is that they also have the assets and supply chains to recycle the digestate. Without economic digestate recycling routes, new digesters will struggle.\u00a0 Digestate is produced at 4% dry solids and is thus expensive to transport.\u00a0 It must therefore be dewatered to at least 20% dry solids.\u00a0 Dewatering liquor must then be treated as it contains soluble N and P and some organic matter.\u00a0 Water Companies have dewatering facilities and a sewage treatment plant to put the liquor back through (nutrient recovery as struvite and ammonia is emerging technology, which is an added environmental advantage).\nPrices for both energy and fertiliser are likely to increase in the medium to long-term.\u00a0 Both biogas and fertiliser outputs from AD represent more sustainable sources of these valuable resources than fossil fuels and inorganic fertilisers, the prices for which will become increasingly expensive by comparison.\nThe allocation of Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) vary considerably for sewage and biowaste (energy generated from digested sewage sludge qualifies for 0.5 ROCs per MWh of electricity generated) whereas that generated from biowaste qualifies for 2 ROCs per MWh, making the allocation of ROCs for mixed feedstock problematic.\u00a0 The Renewable Heat Incentive provides 6.5p/kWh, guaranteed until 2035 for eligible schemes where electricity is generated using CHP units.\nDemographic issues\nThe benefits of existing AD capacity near to urban centres and potential recycling routes for digestate are significant if the regulatory hurdles can be overcome.\u00a0 It should be possible to remove these hurdles, and importantly with no diminution in environmental protection. Co-digestion of waste with sewage sludge at existing wastewater treatment works (which are located close to the major conurbations they serve and hence a ready supply of biodegradable waste feedstock) offers an opportunity to achieve financial viability for AD whilst reducing waste transportation requirements (lowering the carbon intensity of the collection/transportation process). For example, for sewage sludge AD to be financially viable requires about 100,000 population, as does food waste AD. Co-digestion would be viable for a town of 50,000 people but mono-digestion would not and wastes would have to travel to a centralised site with the associated transport carbon emissions. The water industry has a significant experience base on AD, and to a lesser extent in relation to co-digestion.\nFeedstock issues\nThere are a number of waste streams that can be anaerobically digested, particularly domestic and commercial food wastes, and commercial and industrial tankered wastes.\u00a0 The main issues concern the quality of the feedstock and the ability to separate contaminants, which can negatively affect digester efficiency, even if present in relatively small amounts.\u00a0 Quality control of feedstock is thus important, and becomes particularly relevant in the case of source-segregated municipal solid waste where contaminants are commonly found. \u00a0\u00a0The revised Waste Framework Directive (WFD) may deliver improvements in the segregation of waste which may improve feedstock quality issues.\u00a0 A sister Biowaste Directive could also be forthcoming, which may help to ease the regulation of co-digestion.\nThe Animal By Products Regulations (ABPR) [xv] also have important implications for co-digestion because of the proportion of other materials introduced into sewage works AD plant, which may contain meat or other waste animal material.\u00a0 Generally the presence of such material in the feedstock requires heat treatment prior to the digestion process. Defra has been working with Water UK to provide guidance to water industry operators on the requirements of these Regulations including at what point and in what proportions pasteurized ABPR waste can be blended with sewage sludge. Advanced digestion would meet ABPR requirements and would have the benefit of trebling the capacity of many existing digesters.\u00a0 If this treatment were applied to all co-digestion feed then the output would be classified as enhanced treated digestate under the Safe Sludge Matrix [xvi] , but depending on the detail of any agreement, this may not be required.\nJune 2011\nNote: CIWEM Policy Position Statements (PPS) represent the Institution's views on issues at a particular point in time.

But methane has a big effect in its short time\u2014methane is responsible for 75% as much warming as carbon dioxide measured over any given 20 years (Watson, 2009). This means methane reductions could have an immediate beneficial effect on our climate, faster than comparable reductions to CO2.\nClimate change is happening at an alarming rate. Leading nations are calling for emissions reductions of 80% by 2050 and others are saying we need to reduce emissions much sooner. This means we only have a few decades to act, so we need to concentrate on greenhouse gas reductions that will have an immediate impact. Our short-term climate actions should focus on reducing methane emissions so we can see the quickest benefit.\nCompared to the massive requirements necessary to reduce CO2, cutting methane requires only modest investment. Where we stop methane emissions, cooling follows within a decade, not centuries. That could make the difference for many fragile systems on the brink.\u201d\nBack to Top\nWhy isn\u2019t Zero Waste included on most climate action plans?\nWhen the EPA calculates greenhouse gas emissions from waste for our national GHG inventory, they only look at the emissions from landfills and incinerators. But waste isn\u2019t just what happens after you discarded the product\u2014where are the emissions from all the energy and materials used to extract, process and deliver that product to you?\nFigure 1 (left) shows the traditional sector-based view of GHG emissions found in our national GHG inventory. Waste isn\u2019t even represented on this chart, which means climate action plans are focusing primarily on reducing transportation and electricity emissions. The emissions from the energy and materials used to extract, process and deliver products to you, those products that then become trash, are embedded into categories like electric power, transportation, and industry.\nFigure 2 (right) looks at our emissions from a system-based perspective and shows the way we produce, consume and dispose of our goods and food accounts for 42% of our nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. This means the choices we make about our \u201cstuff\u201d has a bigger impact than driving our car or heating our homes. This new approach is called materials management, and it\u2019s defined by the EPA as \u201chow we manage material resources as they flow through the economy, from extraction of materials and food, production, transport, provision of services, reuse of materials and, if necessary, disposal.\u201d By using this approach to measure our greenhouse gas emissions, we can see the huge impact we can have by recycling more, expanding composting programs, and consuming less. Read the EPA report here.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean reducing energy use, investing in renewable energy, or changing our transportation habits and technologies aren\u2019t critical\u2014they are! We need to reduce all our emissions substantially over the next few decades, but we haven\u2019t been using all the tools we have to do this, and Zero Waste is an especially important tool because methane is such a powerful short-term gas.\nBack to Top\nWaste and climate on the local level\nWhen a local community calculates its greenhouse gas emissions from waste, it uses the First Order Decay (FOD) model for landfills (following IPCC protocol). This model measures only methane emissions that take place within the city limits within a given year. Any greenhouse gas emissions or savings from recycling or composting are not included in this approach, and neither are any emissions that occur outside of the city\u2019s boundaries.\nThe EPA\u2019s Waste Reduction Model (WARM) calculates the lifecycle GHG emissions from how we manage materials, not just how we manage waste. This accounts for the energy savings from recycling and composting, as well as landfill emissions. Using WARM to calculate emissions from materials management shows the substantial climate benefits from recycling and composting.\nHere\u2019s an example of how the two models can give you two different results:\nThe IPCC FOD model tells us metals disposed in a landfill emit 0 tons of methane because they\u2019re not biodegradable. This means:\n--> If you landfilled 100% of your metals, your local community GHG inventory would increase by 0.\n--> If you recycled 100% of your metals, your local community GHG inventory would decrease by 0.\nThe EPA's WARM tells us recycling metals can save greenhouse gas emissions because it takes less energy to make new metal products from recycled metal than it does to use virgin metal. For example, recycling an aluminum can saves 95% of the energy used to make the can. In fact, WARM calculates that recycling 90% of U.S. metals could save 101 million mtCO2e annually, the equivalent to taking 19.3 million cars off the road for a year!\n(Calculated by Eco-Cycle using EPA's \u201cMunicipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States Detailed Tables and Figures for 2008 ,\u201d WARM online calculator version 10 with default landfill gas recovery and distances, and EPA's online Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator .)\nLocal communities are missing the connection between their materials management choices and the climate because they\u2019re focused only on the methane emissions from their local landfill. We all share one climate so emissions anywhere will affect all of us. This means we need to make decisions that reduce the greatest amount of GHG emissions, regardless of whether they occur at our local landfill or in a tropical forest across the globe.

Illustrations encouraged.\nBackground Information\nWe all throw our trash \u2018away\u2019. But where does it go after that? In our case, the trash we produce goes to a dump, currently Ordot dump. This dump is at capacity and has been since October 2007, that\u2019s over two years ago! The Ordot dump is an area roughly 54 acres in size located in Ordot, Guam. Trash is received from trash trucks and community members on a daily basis. What happens when our trash arrives at the dump? This process can be broken down into several basic steps: (Consult with students\u2019 responses to the previous activity what they think happens to their trash, then discuss what happens)\n1. Our trash arrives at the dump, whether its picked up at the house or you drop it there yourself.\n2. The trash is moved beyond the dump gates and piled along with all of the waste that was collected that day.\n3. After the trash reaches a certain height it is covered with limestone rocks. Standards dictate how much limestone rock should be deposited. The limestone rock aids in decomposition and filtration of the leachate that is a byproduct of the dump (more on leachate below).\n4. There are major differences between a dump and a landfill.\na. Both landfills and dump produce leachate, a toxic liquid byproduct of the decomposing matter in the dump. Leachate is formed primarily by precipitation that filters through the landfill contents. Leachate can vary in its composition, depending on what the dump or landfill contains. ** This provides a good opportunity to review or introduce the water cycle!**\nb. Think of a dump as a hole in the ground where trash is deposited, the pile keeps getting higher. A landfill is more sophisticated in that it is a hole in the ground, lined with durable plastic to prevent leachate from contaminating the surrounding soil. In a landfill there are mechanisms in place to remove some of the toxic leachate and the toxic gas methane that builds up as a result of decomposition. In dumps, these mechanisms are not present, so both the leachate and methane gas escape into the environment.\ni. Consult this video for information about a landfill in Massachusetts.\u00a0 Vimeo File: So how does a modern lanfull work? Dumps get old and there are protective mechanisms for environmental safety that can fail. Even the best landfill gets old, and leachate is deposited in the environment and can present risks to the population, as is the case in this video.\nii. In Guam\u2019s case, rain is the primary form of precipitation forming leachate. When it rains, the H20 seeps into the soil and the dump contents eventually making it to the bottom of the dump where the leachate directly enters the environment. The lechate that exists in the Ordot Dump has been researched by professors, Dr. Golabi and Dr. Denton, at the University of Guam. Their work has been very important in identifying how the dump effects our local environment. These scientists sampled areas within the landfill and at sites along the Lonfit River. Their findings are summarized below, the articles are published in Micronesica (references below):\na. A significant amount of leachate leaks from the surface of the dump.\nb. The leachate contaminates the ground water and springs minimally due to the type of soil that surrounds the dump.\ni. The soil that surrounds the dump is able to retain toxic nitrate and phosphate compounds. This soil is known as kaolinitic soil, commonly known as china clay. The clay reduces the concentration of toxicants in runoff and thereby reduces the contaminants infiltrating the Lonfit River, a major waterway in the Pago Bay Watershed.\nc. Heavy metals, such as lead, manganese, iron, chromium, and barium, are found in the leachate. In some cases these heavy metals exceed the Guam Water Quality Standards for surface and/or drinking water (i.e., Lead, Chromium, Manganese and Nickel). Small amounts of some heavy metals (iron, cobalt, copper, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc) are required for normal physiological processes, however, excessive amounts can be hazardous to organisms, including humans.\nd. Levels of Enterococci and E. Coli (bacteria that can be toxic to humans) exceeded U.S. EPA recreational water quality standards from the dump to the extent of Pago Bay.\ne. Nitrates, likely from fertilizers and pesticides, were often found to exceed U.S. EPA surface water quality standards for nitrates. Nitrates can be hazardous to our health and that of ecosystems. Nitrate can can cause nitrification of our water systems supporting the growth of algae and plants which negatively affects the propagation of coral reef ecosystems.\nf. Phosphate levels were insignificant. This is good because phosphates can also be damaging to our bodies and healthy coral reef ecosystems.\n2. Read more about the history and use of landfills and dumps here: History of Landfills\nActivity:\nHave the students draw a picture/poster of the trash disposal process.\nChallenge Questions:\n1. Considering what you learned in the last week with Where the Waste Goes lesson plan, how long do you think it will take the Ordot dump to decompose all the waste that has been collected since 1941 when it was created?\n2. What is the difference between a landfill and a dump?\nFind your answer here: Ordot Fact Sheet\n3. Why it is important to know what contaminants are entering our waters from a dump or landfill?\n4. How do scientists test for contaminants?\n5. What do we know about the soil composition at the new landfill site (Dan Dan Landfill)?\n6. What happens if the soil is not capable of filtering the leachate as it does at the Ordot Dump?\nRevisit what it means to be biodegradable\nThe information in this lesson plan\u00a0 aims to build on the information in Lesson Plan 1 by the following:\n1. Give students an opportunity to compare and contrast decomposing matter of varying makeup,\n2. Visualize that organic materials (biodegradable) decompose at a faster rate than non organic (non biodegradable) materials.\nIn the simplest terms biodegradable means a material that is able to be degraded, or broken down. Refer to the websites listed below for more information about biodegradable vs. non-biodegradable resources. Examples of biodegradable materials are: apple core, bones, paper, and flowers. Non-biodegradable refers to materials that are not broken down by organisms. Examples of non-biodegradable materials include: plastic, glass, polyester clothing items, and aluminum cans.\nThings that are biodegradable are often made of organic materials, or things naturally occurring in our environment, not those synthetically produced in a lab. For instance, a banana peel is biodegradable and will take approximately 3 days to degrade, but a plastic bottle will take hundreds of years!\nAssignment\nEach student should be tasked with bringing in trash. A suitable amount of trash would be that produced by their family unit within one day. Family unit defined as those people with which the student resides. Encourage students to include all trash, smelly or not, plastics, fish bones, food parts, etc. If you conduct the experiment the following day, you won\u2019t have to worry about a smelly classroom! Have students create a log of the trash they have brought in (this way they don\u2019t have to log it in your classroom.)\nUsing the trash log that you have created, answer the following questions:\n1. What percentage of your trash is biodegradable?\n2. What percentage of your trash is non-biodegradable?\nDay 2-3 (and beyond): Making a DUMP/Landfill!\nThis part of the lesson plan involves long-term monitoring, the longer the period of \u2018incubation\u2019 the more conclusions can be made from the results of the experiment. Follow the following steps to create your own mini-DUMP. It may be best if you can arrange with your school principal for a outdoor location for you mini-DUMPs to incubate, the heat and exposure to the elements (rain, wind, etc) will best replicate that which occurs in our very own Ordot Dump. What we are replicating is most like a landfill because we have an impermeable lining at the bottom of our depository.\nPrep work\nDrill several small holes in the top the plastic container that will act as your landfill for the next 30 days or so. Clear plastic bins are nice so you can visualize the decomposition process over time. The class can be divided into small groups to minimize supply cost, so each group of students will place their trash into one plastic container.\n1. Place some soil on the bottom of the container.\n2. One at a time, have students dump the contents of their trash collection into the bin. Make sure that the contents of each dump are spread out evenly over the surface of the dump. After each deposit into the dump, cover the contents with 6 inches of soil.\n3. When all the students have deposited their trash into their dump place another 6 inches of soil on top of the contents.\n4. Place the lid on container and wait.\nFollow-up\n1. Check back on the contents of the dump on a weekly basis. Ideally, the dump should incubate for 30 days or more.\nChallenge Questions\n(to be completed at the completion of the dump incubation)\n1. After dissecting the contents of your dump, what contents had degraded? (Use your trash log to reference what you put in it in the first place).\n2. What contents had not degraded?\n3. List the contents that did not degrade:\n4. Why did some contents not degrade in the given period of time?\n5. What percentage of the items rang true to their names, biodegradable or non-biodegradable?\n6. How could you change your trash production to increase the percentage of biodegradable trash that you produce?\nDay 30+: My Trash Cycle (post-activity)\nActivity\nAdminister the Go Away Trash survey prior to instruction. For younger ages, students can be provided with a scaffold:\nDraw a flow chart showing the production of trash in your household from where it is acquired to where the trash goes when it is out of your hands.\nEditor\u2019s Note: Funding for this lesson plan was provided by the \u00a0Sea Grant Program, University of Guam.

They decompose anaerobically, or without oxygen, and in the process create methane, a greenhouse gas (GHG). Methane is 72 times more potent than CO2 over a 20-year period\u2014this means every one ton of methane will trap as much heat in our atmosphere as 72 tons of carbon dioxide! Landfills are a top source of methane, and one that could be easily avoided if we stopped landfilling organic materials and started composting them instead.\nMethane is often cited as 21 times more potent than CO2, and this is also true, but this refers to methane's impact when measured over 100 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calculates the impact of GHG emissions based on three timeframes: 20 years, 100 years and 500 years. Which timeframe a community or a nation chooses to use is a policy decision based on whether they want to emphasize the short or long term. At the Kyoto Protocol, the 100-year timeframe was chosen as the international baseline because climate change was seen as a longer-term threat. Fifteen years later, our climate situation is more dire and immediate than we thought. Now we must cut emissions 80% by 2050, if not significantly sooner. Now we need data to emphasize the short-term impacts of our emissions so we can prioritize reductions to powerful, short-lived gases like methane. We need to look at the impacts of our emissions over the next 20 years if we are going to avoid runaway climate change.\n(Source:IPCC, 2007. \"Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\" Chapter 2: Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing .)\nWhy it\u2019s so important to reduce methane quickly\nMethane only stays in the atmosphere around 8-12 years while carbon dioxide can last for centuries. But methane has a big effect in its short time\u2014methane is responsible for 75% as much warming as carbon dioxide measured over any given 20 years (Watson, 2009). This means methane reductions could have an immediate beneficial effect on our climate, faster than comparable reductions to CO2.\nClimate change is happening at an alarming rate. Leading nations are calling for emissions reductions of 80% by 2050 and others are saying we need to reduce emissions much sooner. This means we only have a few decades to act, so we need to concentrate on greenhouse gas reductions that will have an immediate impact. Our short-term climate actions should focus on reducing methane emissions so we can see the quickest benefit.\n\"Compared to the massive requirements necessary to reduce CO2, cutting methane requires only modest investment. Where we stop methane emissions, cooling follows within a decade, not centuries. That could make the difference for many fragile systems on the brink.\u201d\n-- Robert Watson, former IPCC chair, \u201c A Fast, Cheap Way to Cool the Planet .\u201d Wall Street Journal, December 28, 2009.\nWhy isn\u2019t Zero Waste included on most climate action plans?\nWhen the EPA calculates greenhouse gas emissions from waste for our national GHG inventory, they only look at the emissions from landfills and incinerators. But waste isn\u2019t just what happens after you discarded the product\u2014where are the emissions from all the energy and materials used to extract, process and deliver that product to you?\nFigure 1 (left) shows the traditional sector-based view of GHG emissions found in our national GHG inventory. Waste isn\u2019t even represented on this chart, which means climate action plans are focusing primarily on reducing transportation and electricity emissions. The emissions from the energy and materials used to extract, process and deliver products to you, those products that then become trash, are embedded into categories like electric power, transportation, and industry.\nFigure 2 (right) looks at our emissions from a system-based perspective and shows the way we produce, consume and dispose of our goods and food accounts for 42% of our nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. This means the choices we make about our \u201cstuff\u201d has a bigger impact than driving our car or heating our homes. This new approach is called materials management, and it\u2019s defined by the EPA as \u201chow we manage material resources as they flow through the economy, from extraction of materials and food, production, transport, provision of services, reuse of materials and, if necessary, disposal.\u201d By using this approach to measure our greenhouse gas emissions, we can see the huge impact we can have by recycling more, expanding composting programs, and consuming less. Read the EPA report here.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean reducing energy use, investing in renewable energy, or changing our transportation habits and technologies aren\u2019t critical\u2014they are! We need to reduce all our emissions substantially over the next few decades, but we haven\u2019t been using all the tools we have to do this, and Zero Waste is an especially important tool because methane is such a powerful short-term gas.\n(Chart created by Eco-Cycle based on \" Opportunities to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions through \u000bMaterials and Land Management Practices ,\u201d U.S. EPA, 2009.)\nWaste and climate on the local level\nWhen a local community calculates its greenhouse gas emissions from waste, it uses the First Order Decay (FOD) model for landfills (following IPCC protocol). This model measures only methane emissions that take place within the city limits within a given year. Any greenhouse gas emissions or savings from recycling or composting are not included in this approach, and neither are any emissions that occur outside of the city\u2019s boundaries.\nThe EPA\u2019s Waste Reduction Model (WARM) calculates the lifecycle GHG emissions from how we manage materials, not just how we manage waste. This accounts for the energy savings from recycling and composting, as well as landfill emissions. Using WARM to calculate emissions from materials management shows the substantial climate benefits from recycling and composting.\nHere\u2019s an example of how the two models can give you two different results:\nThe IPCC FOD model tells us metals disposed in a landfill emit 0 tons of methane because they\u2019re not biodegradable. This means:\n--> If you landfilled 100% of your metals, your local community GHG inventory would increase by 0.\n--> If you recycled 100% of your metals, your local community GHG inventory would decrease by 0.\nThe EPA's WARM tells us recycling metals can save greenhouse gas emissions because it takes less energy to make new metal products from recycled metal than it does to use virgin metal. For example, recycling an aluminum can saves 95% of the energy used to make the can. In fact, WARM calculates that recycling 90% of U.S. metals could save 101 million mtCO2e annually, the equivalent to taking 19.3 million cars off the road for a year!\n(Calculated by Eco-Cycle using EPA's \u201cMunicipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States Detailed Tables and Figures for 2008 ,\u201d WARM online calculator version 10 with default landfill gas recovery and distances, and EPA's online Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator .)\nLocal communities are missing the connection between their materials management choices and the climate because they\u2019re focused only on the methane emissions from their local landfill. We all share one climate so emissions anywhere will affect all of us. This means we need to make decisions that reduce the greatest amount of GHG emissions, regardless of whether they occur at our local landfill or in a tropical forest across the globe. Local communities need to use WARM to make the right decisions about materials management so they see the total climate impact of their local actions.\nWhat can you do\n1. Get involved with your community climate action plan. Promote recycling and composting as a proven, short-term strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n3. Use EPA\u2019s WARM to estimate the total climate impact of recycling, composting and waste. Learn more about WARM and see how recycling and composting your discards will help our climate.\nResources for more information\nStop Trashing the Climate report\nStop Trashing the Climate , co-authored by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, Eco-Cycle and GAIA, proves a Zero Waste approach is one of the fastest, cheapest and most effective strategies to protect the climate. Significantly decreasing waste disposed in landfills and incinerators will reduce greenhouse gas emissions the equivalent to closing 21% of U.S. coal-fired power plants. This is comparable to leading climate protection proposals such as improving national vehicle fuel efficiency. Indeed, preventing waste and expanding reuse, recycling, and composting are essential to put us on the path to climate stability.\nRead more about the report and download the executive summary, full report and more>>\nCOOL 2012 Campaign\nEco-Cycle partnered with BioCycle and the GrassRoots Recycling Network (GRRN) to launch the Compostable Organics Out of Landfills by 2012 (COOL 2012) campaign to show communities they can achieve significant climate benefits RIGHT NOW by PREVENTING landfill-produced methane.\nWhat can your community do? There are four COOL solutions:\n1. Seize the Paper: Commit to recycling a minimum of 75% of all paper and composting the rest by 2012.\n2. Source Separate: Require source separation of residential and business waste into three streams: compostables, recyclables and residuals.\n3. Feed Local Soils: Support local farmers and sustainable food production with community composting infrastructure.\n4. Stop Creating Methane: Public policy needs to first support the elimination of methane by requiring source separation of compostables and recyclables, then mitigate methane from existing sources where organics have already been buried.\n"}, {"score": 989.95844, "uuid": "881b4950-f00a-54a6-b2a3-205856c3cafa", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1811wb-83-28164", "target_hostname": "www.dssmithrecycling.com", "target_uri": "http://www.dssmithrecycling.com/news/scottish-zero-waste-regulations", "page_rank": 1.1818102e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "Scottish Zero <em>Waste</em> Regulations | DS Smith Recycling", "snippet": "<em>The</em> key <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> <em>what</em> was originally proposed <em>and</em> <em>what</em> is now proposed <em>are</em> an extension on <em>the</em> date by which municipal (including commercial) <em>biodegradable</em> <em>waste</em> is banned from landfill <em>and</em> <em>the</em> new ban on <em>the</em> use of <em>waste</em> disposal units.", "explanation": null, "document": "Your enquiry: *\nCAPTCHA\nThis question is for testing whether you are a human visitor and to prevent automated spam submissions.\nMath question: *\nSolve this simple math problem and enter the result.

Proposals for a range of new measures were included in a Consultation issued in January and results of that consultation and final proposals have just been published.\nThe proposed Zero Waste Regulations will affect every business in Scotland although many might already be doing what is required. The basic principles are that all businesses should be presenting their paper/cardboard, metal, plastic and glass waste (but no longer textiles) for separate collection with those for whom food preparation is their primary business activity also having to separate out food waste. Once segregated, they must then be collected in a way that \u2018does not compromise their quality\u2019. This is a particularly sensitive issue as England\u2019s proposal to allow collection of mixed recyclables is being challenged under judicial review because of the quality concerns. Once collected, recyclable material cannot then be landfilled, but where residual waste still contains these recyclables, they must then be removed through further treatment prior to disposal through incineration. There will also be a ban on the landfilling of non-industrial waste that contains organic content above a certain level. The time line on these requirements has changed slightly following the consultation, but a further restriction that has been added is that the use of waste disposal units by businesses to dispose of their food waste will be banned where the food is then discharged into public sewers.\nThe key differences between what was originally proposed and what is now proposed are an extension on the date by which municipal (including commercial) biodegradable waste is banned from landfill and the new ban on the use of waste disposal units. Many compare this approach very favourably to the more aspirational approach taken in the English Strategy Review, but it is a challenging programme that will not be without its problems, not least of which will be its policing. The Draft Regulations are expected soon.\nEnvironmental Newsletter\nFollow us on\n"}, {"score": 960.0067, "uuid": "55219519-988f-5d0d-a5fb-b30da583fb81", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1812wb-24-04515", "target_hostname": "mfe.govt.nz", "target_uri": "http://mfe.govt.nz/environmental-reporting/report-cards/waste-composition/2009/index.html", "page_rank": 1.2320576e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Solid <em>Waste</em> Composition | Ministry for <em>the</em> Environment", "snippet": "Figure 2: <em>Waste</em> composition proportions for <em>the</em> national indicator sites <em>and</em> other selected sites, 2007\u00e2\u0080\u00932008 As may be expected, there <em>are</em> <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> <em>the</em> four indicator sites <em>and</em> <em>the</em> wider sample.", "explanation": null, "document": "This document is also available in PDF (1.5, MB)\nSummary\nNew Zealand disposed of an estimated 3.156 million tonnes of waste to landfills in 2006. Waste can represent the inefficient use of valuable natural resources when potentially reusable materials, such as paper, plastic, organic waste, glass and metal, are disposed of to landfills. Some wastes produce powerful greenhouse gases and others have significant health impacts on humans and animals. Waste is unsightly and can pollute our waterways, air and land unless it is adequately managed.\nBy gaining an understanding of what materials are being thrown away we can identify priority wastes for resource efficiency and waste minimisation programmes. Because the environmental and health impacts of waste are driven by waste type, better waste composition information can also improve management of high-impact waste types.\nThis report card estimates the composition of waste disposed of to landfills in New Zealand by reporting the results of waste composition audits at four national indicator sites (landfills). The sites are a sample of the 60-plus landfills across the country and provide a best available national picture of waste disposal patterns in New Zealand.\nCURRENT SITUATION: Organic waste was the largest proportion of waste disposed of to landfills in 2007\u00e2\u0080\u00932008, representing 28 per cent of the overall waste stream; rubble and potentially hazardous waste were next, representing about 15 per cent each; and timber represented 11 per cent. Potentially reusable wastes, such as organic waste, rubble, timber, paper, plastic, metal and glass, together represented over three-quarters of the waste stream.\nMixed\nTREND: Between 2002\u00e2\u0080\u00932004 and 2007\u00e2\u0080\u00932008, the proportions of organic, plastic, glass, and nappies and sanitary waste have increased in the New Zealand waste stream, while rubble, paper and metal waste have decreased. These changes reflect changing consumption patterns, recovery rates of recyclable materials, and construction activity.\nThe short-term trends are consistent with longer-term trends for most waste types, suggesting similar drivers have been operating over both time periods. Changing trends have been apparent for organic waste (which has decreased over the long-term, but shown increases in recent years), and construction and demolition waste (which has grown over the long-term, but decreased in recent years). These inconsistencies are largely artificial, however, because they are caused by changes in how soil disposed of to landfills is classified.\nINTERNATIONAL COMPARISON: By international comparisons, New Zealand has a mixed performance in terms of disposal of potentially reusable materials to landfills. Overall, New Zealand has a low proportion of paper disposal, average proportions of glass, organic waste, metal and plastic waste disposal, and a high proportion of \u00e2\u0080\u0098other\u2019 waste disposal compared with other members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\nFUTURE WATCH: Predicted falls in consumption and slow economic growth to March 2010 may influence people to reduce use or increase reuse of existing materials. The present trend of increasing proportions of organic, plastic and glass waste disposed of to landfills may flatten off or even reverse, and the decreases in paper and metal wastes may intensify.\nOngoing falls in building consent applications suggest the proportion of rubble and timber waste may also continue to drop in the short-term. However, predicted increases in New Zealand\u2019s population and the number of households may require additional construction activity. This, and planned new infrastructure investment, may result in an increase in the proportions of associated waste types in the longer term.\nReduced global demand for recyclable materials due to the recession may affect recycling operations and collections in New Zealand. As a result, we could expect the recovery rates of some recyclable materials (eg, paper, plastic and metal) to drop, which may lead to increased proportions of these materials disposed of to landfills. However, new recycling sorting and processing capacity being developed within New Zealand may offset this trend.\nThe Waste Minimisation Act 2008 and new targets set as part of the review of the New Zealand Waste Strategy are likely to help reduce the disposal of some priority waste types to landfills.\nIntroduction\nWaste is \u201cany thing disposed of or discarded\u201d (Waste Minimisation Act 2008, section 5(1)). Waste is generated in numerous forms \u00e2\u0080\u0093 solid, liquid or gas \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which can change over time (Ministry for the Environment, 2002a). Waste comprises a mixture of many different materials, including organic, paper, plastic, metal, timber and potentially hazardous substances. It can be generated at different times during the material\u2019s life cycle, extraction, manufacturing and consumption (Ministry for the Environment, 2007a). In essence, the waste stream reflects changing economic activity, patterns of production and consumption (Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, 2004), legislation and waste management costs.\nAn estimated 3.156 million tonnes of waste were disposed of to New Zealand landfills in 2006 (Ministry for the Environment, 2007a).\nWhy is waste composition important?\nRecycling 1 kg of aluminium saves up to 6 kg of bauxite rock, and enough electricity to run your television for a week.\nBy understanding what materials are in the waste stream we can identify to what degree valuable natural resources are being thrown away rather than reused, recycled or recovered to create other products, materials or energy. This waste composition information can then help develop waste minimisation policies, target waste minimisation programmes and improve recycling schemes. As an example, local authorities can use waste composition information to target reuse or recycling schemes for materials that make up a large part of the waste stream in their area. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\nAn improved understanding of the make up of our waste stream can also lead to important economic, environmental and social benefits. This is because disposal of recyclable materials to landfills represents an inefficient use of valuable natural resources and energy (Ministry for the Environment, 2007a). Disposal of potentially reusable materials, such as paper, glass and metal to landfills, means these materials cannot be used again. New raw material must be used instead, creating potentially avoidable environmental impacts. Extracting and processing raw materials involves greater generation of greenhouse gas emissions, water use, pollution and energy use compared with using recycled material (Scrap Metal Recycling Association of New Zealand, 2009).\nBecause the environmental and health impacts of waste are driven by waste type, better waste composition information can improve our understanding of these impacts, and aid in the management of high-impact waste types. As an example, the proportion and types of hazardous waste in the waste stream have important implications for the way in which waste needs to be managed. In addition, the composition of waste disposed of to landfills is an important influence on the production of leachate, a liquid produced from the breakdown of waste that can have environmental and health impacts (Centre for Advanced Engineering, 2000).\nDifferent materials also produce different amounts of greenhouse gases as they break down in a landfill. The waste sector generated 2.4 per cent of New Zealand\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions in 2006, with paper generating the most followed by timber and organic waste. Textiles also contribute a significant amount despite only representing a small proportion of the waste stream (Ministry for the Environment, 2008a). By having a better understanding of the composition of the waste stream we can help minimise greenhouse gas emissions from the waste sector.\nThe design and operation of landfills have been improving over time. This has resulted in improved management of the environmental impacts of waste (Ministry for the Environment, 2007c). In 2006, over three-quarters of landfills managed leachate in some way, over 80 per cent required documentation of hazardous waste disposal, and over 20 per cent collected landfill gas (Ministry for the Environment, 2007c). While members of the public perceive that there has been an improvement in waste management in New Zealand, in a recent national public perceptions survey waste was still considered to be a concern in terms of the damage it causes to soils, freshwater, marine and coastal environments (Hughey et al, 2008).\nText box 1: What are environmental report cards?\nEnvironment New Zealand 2007, the country\u2019s second national state of the environment report, provided information from around 115 national-scale environmental data sets. Its primary focus was to report on the 66 national data sets that constitute New Zealand\u2019s core set of 22 environmental indicators. These indicators cover 10 domains: four \u00e2\u0080\u0098pressures\u2019 on the environment (consumption, transport, energy and waste), and six \u00e2\u0080\u0098states\u2019 of the environment (air, atmosphere, land, fresh water, oceans and biodiversity).\nA key focus of the Ministry for the Environment\u2019s national environmental reporting programme is to produce a series of \u00e2\u0080\u0098report cards\u2019 to provide updated information on the indicators reported in Environment New Zealand 2007. This is one such report card.\nAbout this report card\nThis environmental report card provides information on the composition of New Zealand\u2019s solid waste disposed of to landfills.\nThe report card estimates the proportion of each waste type in the overall waste stream. In other words, it estimates, for every unit of waste, what percentage of the unit is made up of each waste type.\nThe proportion for each waste type is calculated from the quantity (tonnage) of each waste type measured during a waste composition survey.\nGiven the small sample sizes for our survey, this report card does not attempt to extrapolate estimates of annual tonnages at the indicator sites from the survey data available, nor provide national tonnages.\nThe quantity (by weight) of solid waste disposed of to landfills in New Zealand will be reported on in future once new quantity data is available from 2010.\nThe indicator sites studied in this report card accept municipal, industrial and hazardous waste (see text box 2). Cleanfills, and landfills that accept only industrial and/or hazardous waste, incinerated waste, and legacy waste (eg, stockpiled tyres or agrichemicals) are all outside the scope of this report card.\nText box 2: What is disposed of in landfills and cleanfills?\nLandfills and cleanfills are places in which solid waste is disposed of.\nLandfills can accept municipal solid waste, industrial waste and/or hazardous waste. In contrast, cleanfills accept cleanfill: inert material, such as clay, soil, concrete or brick, that, when buried, will have no harmful effects on people or the environment. Inert materials are free of combustible, biodegradable or leachable components, hazardous substances or liquid waste (Ministry for the Environment, 2007a). Some cleanfills are also consented to accept small quantities of other waste.\nMunicipal solid waste is any non-hazardous, solid waste from a combination of domestic, commercial and industrial sources (Centre for Advanced Engineering, 2000). This can include food and garden waste, rubble and timber.\nIndustrial waste is specific to industry or industrial processes (Centre for Advanced Engineering, 2000). This can include abattoir waste.\nHazardous waste poses a present or future threat to people or the environment because of properties such as its:\nexplosiveness or flammability\ncorrosiveness or capacity to oxidise\ntoxicity or eco-toxicity.\nThis waste needs treatment to make it safe or reduce its impact before landfill disposal (Centre for Advanced Engineering, 2000). This could include sewage sludge, paint and asbestos.\nHow is waste composition measured?\nWaste composition data in New Zealand comes from visual or sort-and-weigh surveys. Such surveys provide a snapshot of waste composition at that time.\nThe Ministry for the Environment developed the Waste Analysis Protocol (WAP) in 1992 to guide the collection of statistically robust information on waste composition in New Zealand. Waste materials were classified into one of eight categories (see table 1).\nThe Ministry reviewed and revised the WAP in 2002 and it became known as the Solid Waste Analysis Protocol (SWAP). The SWAP retains the core methodologies of the earlier protocol but has four additional categories. The WAP paper, metal, construction and demolition, and other categories were split into more detailed categories in the SWAP (see table 1).\nTable 1: Waste composition categories used in this report card\nWAP primary category\n"}, {"score": 959.13776, "uuid": "e4e13aa4-ff2d-5ee5-9522-05cda947885c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0512wb-38-09008", "target_hostname": "www.mfe.govt.nz", "target_uri": "http://www.mfe.govt.nz/environmental-reporting/report-cards/waste-composition/2009/index.html", "page_rank": 1.4163131e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "Solid <em>Waste</em> Composition | Ministry for <em>the</em> Environment", "snippet": "Figure 2: <em>Waste</em> composition proportions for <em>the</em> national indicator sites <em>and</em> other selected sites, 2007\u00e2\u0080\u00932008 As may be expected, there <em>are</em> <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> <em>the</em> four indicator sites <em>and</em> <em>the</em> wider sample.", "explanation": null, "document": "This document is also available in PDF (1.5, MB)\nSummary\nNew Zealand disposed of an estimated 3.156 million tonnes of waste to landfills in 2006.

While members of the public perceive that there has been an improvement in waste management in New Zealand, in a recent national public perceptions survey waste was still considered to be a concern in terms of the damage it causes to soils, freshwater, marine and coastal environments (Hughey et al, 2008).\nText box 1: What are environmental report cards?\nEnvironment New Zealand 2007, the country\u2019s second national state of the environment report, provided information from around 115 national-scale environmental data sets. Its primary focus was to report on the 66 national data sets that constitute New Zealand\u2019s core set of 22 environmental indicators. These indicators cover 10 domains: four \u00e2\u0080\u0098pressures\u2019 on the environment (consumption, transport, energy and waste), and six \u00e2\u0080\u0098states\u2019 of the environment (air, atmosphere, land, fresh water, oceans and biodiversity).\nA key focus of the Ministry for the Environment\u2019s national environmental reporting programme is to produce a series of \u00e2\u0080\u0098report cards\u2019 to provide updated information on the indicators reported in Environment New Zealand 2007. This is one such report card.\nAbout this report card\nThis environmental report card provides information on the composition of New Zealand\u2019s solid waste disposed of to landfills.\nThe report card estimates the proportion of each waste type in the overall waste stream. In other words, it estimates, for every unit of waste, what percentage of the unit is made up of each waste type.\nThe proportion for each waste type is calculated from the quantity (tonnage) of each waste type measured during a waste composition survey.\nGiven the small sample sizes for our survey, this report card does not attempt to extrapolate estimates of annual tonnages at the indicator sites from the survey data available, nor provide national tonnages.\nThe quantity (by weight) of solid waste disposed of to landfills in New Zealand will be reported on in future once new quantity data is available from 2010.\nThe indicator sites studied in this report card accept municipal, industrial and hazardous waste (see text box 2). Cleanfills, and landfills that accept only industrial and/or hazardous waste, incinerated waste, and legacy waste (eg, stockpiled tyres or agrichemicals) are all outside the scope of this report card.\nText box 2: What is disposed of in landfills and cleanfills?\nLandfills and cleanfills are places in which solid waste is disposed of.\nLandfills can accept municipal solid waste, industrial waste and/or hazardous waste. In contrast, cleanfills accept cleanfill: inert material, such as clay, soil, concrete or brick, that, when buried, will have no harmful effects on people or the environment. Inert materials are free of combustible, biodegradable or leachable components, hazardous substances or liquid waste (Ministry for the Environment, 2007a). Some cleanfills are also consented to accept small quantities of other waste.\nMunicipal solid waste is any non-hazardous, solid waste from a combination of domestic, commercial and industrial sources (Centre for Advanced Engineering, 2000). This can include food and garden waste, rubble and timber.\nIndustrial waste is specific to industry or industrial processes (Centre for Advanced Engineering, 2000). This can include abattoir waste.\nHazardous waste poses a present or future threat to people or the environment because of properties such as its:\nexplosiveness or flammability\ncorrosiveness or capacity to oxidise\ntoxicity or eco-toxicity.\nThis waste needs treatment to make it safe or reduce its impact before landfill disposal (Centre for Advanced Engineering, 2000). This could include sewage sludge, paint and asbestos.\nHow is waste composition measured?\nWaste composition data in New Zealand comes from visual or sort-and-weigh surveys. Such surveys provide a snapshot of waste composition at that time.\nThe Ministry for the Environment developed the Waste Analysis Protocol (WAP) in 1992 to guide the collection of statistically robust information on waste composition in New Zealand. Waste materials were classified into one of eight categories (see table 1).\nThe Ministry reviewed and revised the WAP in 2002 and it became known as the Solid Waste Analysis Protocol (SWAP). The SWAP retains the core methodologies of the earlier protocol but has four additional categories. The WAP paper, metal, construction and demolition, and other categories were split into more detailed categories in the SWAP (see table 1).\nTable 1: Waste composition categories used in this report card\nWAP primary category\n"}, {"score": 946.66046, "uuid": "b66456df-c2d7-5ea2-b12c-b1ad22fe1035", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1508wb-38-13970", "target_hostname": "cases.soe.umich.edu", "target_uri": "http://cases.soe.umich.edu/plans.php?nav=showplan&dqid=110&lpid=56&printfriendly=yes&packet=no", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "CASES: Is it <em>biodegradable</em>?

She decided to review their results from the decomposition lesson, in which they observed apples decaying in plastic bags. The students recalled that the apple began to decompose after a while but, when Autumn then asked them if the bag had decomposed too, the students responded no. So, as a driving question for this lesson, she proposed that the class try to answer the question: why did the apple decompose but not the plastic bag?\nAfter performing their investigations, the students found that some types of trash decompose faster than others items like plastics and metal. She asked the students to think about the original question and whether or not both plastic bags and apples end up in landfills. How could the evidence from their investigations help answer the driving question? Students inferred from their observations that plastic bags would stay in dumps for a lot longer than apples. Autumn felt her students were ready to use this knowledge in the next lesson to explore why the choices they make in their own lives are important.\nTeacher Bios\nWho are the (fictional) teachers depicted in the Images of Inquiry?\nAutumn\nAutumn is a third-year 5th-grade teacher. She is very positive about teaching science and wants her students to be well-prepared to deal with science-related issues in their real lives, something she considers very important. Through one of her undergraduate science courses, Autumn had the opportunity to work on a water-quality study for one of her professors. She now volunteers doing outreach for a conservation organization in her community. However, while Autumn feels comfortable with her ability to help her kids understand science concepts, she also wants to learn how to better help them understand and make decisions about science in society as well as improve her subject matter knowledge.\nAuthor(s): CASES Team\n"}, {"score": 941.5456, "uuid": "dd9b1266-f6e2-5bfa-bc42-c16474061348", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1716wb-45-25481", "target_hostname": "epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu", "target_uri": "http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Municipal_waste_statistics", "page_rank": 1.2320331e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Municipal <em>waste</em> statistics - Statistics Explained", "snippet": "<em>The</em> \u2018other treatment\u2019 category was calculated as <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> <em>the</em> sum of <em>the</em> amounts treated <em>and</em> <em>the</em> amounts of <em>waste</em> generated.", "explanation": null, "document": "Main statistical findings\nMunicipal waste generated by country\nEurostat has been collecting and publishing data on municipal waste since 1995. These data are widely used for comparing municipal waste generation and treatment in different countries, and indicators on municipal waste are used to monitor European waste policies. The data on municipal waste expressed in kilogram per capita are part of a set of indicators which are compiled annually to monitor the EU\u2019s sustainable development strategy.\nThe data presented cover the period from 1995 to 2009 for the 27 EU Member States; for the candidate countries Croatia (only 2006 and 2008), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (only 2008) and Turkey, for the EFTA countries Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, and the potential candidate country Bosnia and Herzegovina (only 2008 and 2009) data are presented as far as possible.\nFigure 1 shows municipal waste generation by country expressed in kilogram per capita. To illustrate the developments, the graph contains the waste amounts generated in 1995, 2002 and 2009. The figure includes the EU-27 aggregates for comparison and the countries are sorted in decreasing order by municipal waste generation in 2009.\nThe totals of municipal waste generation in 2009 vary considerably, ranging from 831 kg per capita in Denmark to 316 kg per capita in the Czech Republic. The variation reflects differences in consumption patterns and economic wealth of the countries, but also depends greatly on the organisation of municipal waste collection and management. Differences between individual countries exist in particular with regard to the degree to which waste from commerce, trade and administration is collected and managed together with waste from households. In most countries, households generate between 60\u00a0% and 90\u00a0% of the municipal waste while the remainder can be attributed to commercial sources and administration.\nIn 23 of the 31 countries, the amount of municipal waste generated per capita increased between 1995 and 2009, rising steadily in 14 of these countries, with the highest annual growth rates recorded for Malta (3.9\u00a0%), Greece (3.3\u00a0%) and Denmark (3.0\u00a0%). In the remaining nine countries the overall increasing trend was interrupted in the period around 2002. Of these, six countries showed an increase from 1995 to 2002, with the largest annual growth rates being in Austria, Ireland and Latvia, before the amounts stabilised or declined slightly between 2002 and 2009.\nConversely, three countries (Slovakia, Czech Republic and Poland) report decreasing waste generation for the period from 1995 to 2002 followed by an increase between 2002 and 2008.\nOf the eight countries with an overall decrease from 1995 to 2009, only three (Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania) showed a decline in both periods before and after 2002. Bulgaria showed the largest reduction with a steady annual decline by 3.0\u00a0% while in Hungary waste generation did not change significantly throughout the whole period (-0.5\u00a0% per annum).\nIn the five other cases the decline was not steady. The figures for Turkey and Germany show a small increase until 2002 by less than 0.5\u00a0% per annum, followed by annual decreases of 2.0\u00a0% and 1.2\u00a0%, respectively. Slovenia and Norway reported larger overall reductions; however, these developments are mainly due to a retrospective reassessment and methodological changes. Thus, the overall trend of these two countries is not assessable.\nFrom 2002 on, the evolution of the methodologies was finalised in most of the countries, so that the waste generation time series of 2002 and later is more accurate and stable than that between 1995 and 2001.\nMunicipal waste treated in Europe\nTable 1: Municipal waste landfilled, incinerated, recycled and composted in the EU-27, 1995 to 2009 - Source: Eurostat (env_wasmun)\nFigure 2: Municipal waste treatment, EU-27, (kg per capita), 1995-2009 - Source: Eurostat (env_wasmun)\nIn the following section, differences in the management of municipal waste are shown and the various countries\u2019 treatment strategies are identified on the basis of the reported amounts of municipal waste landfilled , incinerated , recycled and composted . For incineration , the countries are asked for a distinction between incineration with and without energy recovery. However, as no clear classification criteria have been applied so far, the comparability of results among countries and over time remains fairly limited [1] . Therefore, the current data allow only analysis of the total amount incinerated.\nTable 1 shows the amounts of municipal waste treated in the European Union (EU-27) for the period 1995 to 2009 by treatment method in million tonnes and kg per capita. Figure 2 shows the amounts of waste generated at EU-27 level and the amounts of waste subject to the four treatment categories ( landfill , incineration, recycling , composting ).\nThe \u2018other treatment\u2019 category was calculated as the difference between the sum of the amounts treated and the amounts of waste generated. This difference is caused mainly by those countries that have to estimate the waste generation in areas not covered by the municipal waste collection scheme and thus report more waste generated than treated. Consequently, increased coverage of the population at EU-27 level (89\u00a0% in 1995, 97\u00a0% in 2009) has led to decreasing \u2018other treatment\u2019.\nIn addition, the \u2018other treatment\u2019 category reflects the effects of import and export, weight losses, double-counting of secondary wastes (e.g. landfilling and recycling of residues from incineration), differences due to time lags, temporary storage and increasingly the allocation of pre-treatment such as mechanical biological treatment. This may even lead to a higher amount treated for a certain year. At EU-27 level, all of these effects contribute only marginally and tend to cancel each other out. However, at country level, the effects are considerable, and the treatment shares presented below are therefore always related to the total amounts treated and not to the amounts generated.\nIn spite of the increase in waste generation in the EU-27, the amounts of municipal waste landfilled have been reduced. In the reference period, the landfilled total in the EU-27 declined by 45.6 million tonnes, or 32\u00a0%, from 141.3 million tonnes (296 kg per capita) in 1995 to 95.7 million tonnes (191 kg per capita) in 2009, corresponding to an annual decline of 2.7\u00a0%. Since 2002, the landfilled amounts have fallen by as much as 4.4\u00a0% per year.\nAs a result, the share of landfilling in the EU-27 dropped from 68\u00a0% in 1995 to 38\u00a0% in 2008.\nThis reduction can partly be attributed to the implementation of European legislation, for instance Directive 62/1994 on packaging and packaging waste. By the year 2001, the Member States had to recover a minimum of 50\u00a0% of all packaging put on the market. With the revised recovery target of 60\u00a0% to be achieved by 31 December 2008, a further increase of separately collected packaging waste could be observed.\nFurthermore, the implementation of Directive 31/1999 on the landfill of waste, which requires Member States to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste going to landfills to 75\u00a0% by 16 July 2006, to 50\u00a0% by 16 July 2009 and to 35\u00a0% by 16 July 2016 [2] , has contributed to this development. This Directive has led to different strategies preventing the organic fraction of municipal waste from being landfilled, namely composting (including fermentation), incineration and pre-treatment such as mechanical-biological treatment (including physical stabilisation).\nAs a result, the amounts of waste recycled increased from 21.8 million tonnes (46 kg per capita) in 1995 to 59.2 million tonnes (118 kg per capita) in 2009, which corresponds to overall growth by a factor of 2.7 at an annual rate of 7.4\u00a0%. The share of municipal waste recycled overall increased from 11\u00a0% to 24\u00a0%.\nThe recovery of organic material by composting is the treatment method that has increased the most.\nThis increase corresponds to an annual growth rate of 9.1\u00a0%. Recycling and composting together accounted for a share of 42\u00a0% in 2009 and have exceeded the landfill share since 2008.\nWaste incineration has also grown steadily in the reference period, although not to the extent of recycling and composting. Since 1995, the amounts of municipal waste incinerated in the EU-27 have increased by 19.6 million tonnes or 63.1\u00a0%, and accounted for 50.7 million tonnes or 20\u00a0% of the total amount treated in 2009. This corresponds to an increase of municipal waste incinerated from 65 kg per capita to 101 kg per capita.\nMechanical-biological treatment as well as sorting of waste are not covered directly as a category in the reporting of municipal waste treatment. These types of pre-treatment require an additional final treatment of the waste. In practice, the amounts delivered to mechanical-biological treatment or sorting should be reported on the basis of the subsequent final treatment steps. However, the way these amounts are allocated to the four treatment categories (incineration, landfilling, recycling and composting) is, on a country scale, considerably different and some countries report only on the first (pre-) treatment step.\nAs a consequence, the reporting on the current set of variables often requires additional information in order to relate the amounts of municipal waste landfilled, incinerated, recycled and composted to the amounts generated at country level. Therefore, all percentages presented in the following are related to the total municipal waste treated.\nMunicipal waste treated by country\nFigure 3: Municipal waste treated in 2009 by country and treatment category, sorted by percentage, 2011\nFigure 4: Municipal waste treated in 2009 by country and treatment category, sorted by percentage of landfilling (kg per capita),2011 - Source: Eurostat (env_wasmun)\nFigure 3 and Figure 4 illustrate the huge differences between countries with regard to the state of their waste management systems.\nFigure 3 presents the amounts of municipal waste landfilled, incinerated, recycled and composted in 2008 as a percentage of the total amounts treated.\nFigure 4 shows the corresponding figures in kilogram per capita. Both are sorted by the percentage of waste amounts landfilled relative to the total amounts treated.\nSeveral countries are very advanced in diverting municipal waste from landfills, often due to the implementation of national measures to reduce landfilling of municipal waste. Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Belgium have reported landfill rates below 5\u00a0%.\nIn Sweden and Denmark, there has been a ban on landfilling combustible waste since 2002 and 1997 respectively. The waste has to be recycled, treated by anaerobic digestion or incinerated. This strategy gives these two countries the highest incineration rates for municipal waste in the EU-27, with 49\u00a0% and 48\u00a0% respectively, matched only by the incineration rate of Switzerland (49\u00a0%). These three countries, together with France, were the only ones with landfill rates below 80\u00a0%, where the amounts incinerated equalled or exceeded the amounts recycled or composted. Mostly, the countries with low landfill rates had a larger combined share of recycling and composting than incineration.\nLandfilling rates in the Netherlands fell in the 1990s as a result of recycling, composting and incineration of municipal waste. A further reduction occurred when the direct disposal of mixed municipal waste was banned as of 2003, resulting in only 4 kg per capita municipal waste directly landfilled in 2009.\nIn Sweden, the landfilled amounts dropped from 64 kg per capita in 2003 to 7 kg per capita in 2009 after the introduction of a landfill ban on organic material in 2005.\nIn Germany, landfilling was reduced steadily over the last decade mainly by recycling, mechanicalbiological treatment and incineration. A considerable drop in landfilled amounts was due to the landfill ban for untreated municipal waste that entered into force on 30 June 2005.\nSimilarly, Austria has allowed landfilling only for pre-treated waste since 2004. As a result, the landfill share decreased from 28\u00a0% in 2003 to 1\u00a0% in 2009. The incineration rate increased accordingly from 11\u00a0% to 29\u00a0% in the same period. It should be noted, however, that some of the low landfill shares are also due to the exclusion of residues of other operations from reporting.\nLandfill shares of between 14\u00a0% and 17\u00a0% were reported by Norway and Luxembourg. France, Italy, Finland and the United Kingdom reported amounts being landfilled in the range of 32\u00a0% to 50\u00a0%. If categorised by landfill rates, the fourteen countries with the lowest landfill rates belong to the former EU-15 .\nAmong the so-called old Member States, landfill rates in 2008 were highest in Greece (81\u00a0%), Portugal (62\u00a0%), Ireland (62\u00a0%) and Spain (52\u00a0%).\nThe highest rates for recycling were reported by Germany (48\u00a0%, 274 kg per capita), Sweden (36\u00a0%, 171 kg per capita) and Belgium (36\u00a0%, 175 kg per capita), whereas Austria (40\u00a0%, 235 kg per capita) and the Netherlands (28\u00a0%, 144 kg per capita) reported the largest shares of composting.\nItaly\u2019s reported share of composting is the second highest (32\u00a0%), but national data for 2007 [3] suggest that the Italian figure for composting contains more than 70\u00a0% amounts treated by mechanical-biological operations. Belgium was among the countries with the largest shares for both recycling (36\u00a0%) and composting (24\u00a0%).\nIreland and Greece are the only \u2018old\u2019 Member States without incineration facilities for municipal waste, although Ireland reported 4\u00a0% of incineration in 2009 which was almost exclusively attributed to coincineration of refused derived fuel, but also use of wood as a fuel and use of edible oils and fats in biodiesel processing. Ireland has succeeded in reducing the amount of municipal waste going to landfills since 2001 considerably by about 25\u00a0% thanks to strong progress in recycling.\nIn the new Member States and the candidate countries as well as in Iceland, landfilling is still the predominant waste management option. Landfill rates in these countries range between 62\u00a0% in Slovenia and 100\u00a0% in Bulgaria. The situation is further characterised by a low number of waste incineration facilities on the one hand, and collection and recycling schemes that are partly still in their infancy on the other hand.\nIncineration of municipal waste is reported by nine of these countries. The contribution of waste incineration to municipal waste management is highest in the Czech Republic (12\u00a0%, 33 kg per capita), Iceland (11\u00a0%, 57 kg per capita), Hungary (9\u00a0%, 41 kg per capita) and Slovakia (7\u00a0%, 22 kg per capita). In the other Member States the incineration rate is less than 2\u00a0%.\nAs could be expected from the figures on waste generation, Figure 4 shows that the amounts treated per capita vary to a large extent. The sorting by percentage of landfilling illustrates the trend that the countries with high landfill rates have generally lower total amounts treated than those with lower landfill rates.\nExcept for Cyprus (775 kg per capita) and Malta (622 kg per capita), all countries displayed on the right side of Figure 4 show total amounts treated of far less than 500 kg per capita.\nThese countries report landfill rates of 75\u00a0% and more, as shown in Figure 3, whereas of the remaining 18 countries listed on the left side of Figure 4, only a few reported total amounts treated much lower than 500 kg per capita (e.g. Norway and Finland). The high figures for Cyprus and Malta can be attributed to a large share of commercial waste as well as to the impact of tourism, as these countries had by far the highest tourism intensity indicators in Europe in 2006.\nMunicipal waste treatment strategies\nFigure 5: Waste treatment strategy by country groups, 2009 - Source: Eurostat (env_wasmun)\nAs regards strategies for waste treatment, the European Environment Agency (EEA) offered a reasonable approach for a grouping that takes into account the combined rates of incineration and material recovery (represented as the sum of recycling and composting). The results of this approach were published in 2007, based on data up to reference year 2005 [4] .\nThe rationale of the EEA approach is that countries may follow different strategies to divert waste away from landfills. These strategies are characterised either by a combination of material recovery and incineration or by focusing mainly on material recovery and less on incineration. Either of these two strategies may be seen as quite effective in diverting waste from being landfilled.\nHowever, if material recovery is supplemented by incineration, a lower level of landfilling may be achieved, because incineration facilities have the advantage of being able to divert streams from being landfilled that may not be used for material recovery but contain a reasonable heat value. In addition, incineration may divert biodegradable material of lower heat value away from landfill after pretreatment such as stabilisation and/or drying by mechanical-biological or mechanical-physical processes.\nFigure 5 shows the results of this approach for the latest data of reference year 2009. The first group contains countries that apply a combined strategy with high rates of more than 25\u00a0% for material recovery (composting and recycling) as well as incineration.\nThe second group consists of countries where systems for recycling and composting are established to an extent that a high rate of material recovery of more than 25\u00a0% is achieved, but incineration rates fall short of 25\u00a0%. The third group relies mostly on landfilling as a treatment option with equally low rates of less than 25\u00a0% for incineration and material recovery.\nNote that the percentages in Figure 5 were, in contrast to the EEA publication, calculated in relation to the total amounts treated.\nIt can be seen that group 1 covers the 10 countries with the lowest landfill rates (Figures 3 and 4). Groups 2 and 3 deviate from the strict order by landfill rate for the reason that Portugal and Iceland, despite landfill rates lower than 75\u00a0%, belong to group 3 on account of their low shares for material recovery (both below 20\u00a0%), while Estonia reported material recovery of just over 25\u00a0% with a higher landfill rate of 75\u00a0%. The high landfill rate in Estonia compared to the other two countries is due to the fact that Estonia reported almost no incineration, whereas the remaining two countries diverted shares of between 11\u00a0% (Iceland) and 18\u00a0% (Portugal) away from landfilling to incineration.\nThe population is fairly evenly distributed within the three groups, with each group representing roughly 200 million inhabitants, ranging from 181 million (group 2) to 210 million (group 1).\nWhen considering the geographical distribution, group 1 with the \u2018most advanced\u2019 treatment strategy is concentrated in North-Western Europe. The other two groups are located stepwise around group 1 in all directions, except for the eastern direction, where countries belonging to group 3 share direct borders with countries belonging to group 1.\nDevelopment of municipal waste treatment strategies since 1995\nFigure 6: Development of municipal waste treatment, 1995 to 2009 by treatment groups and category, (% kg per capita)\nThe developments in respect of waste treatment in the three identified groups of countries are presented in Figure 6. Note that for the evaluation of municipal waste treatment over time group 3 was calculated without the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina on account of the limited data available (only one or two reference years).\nThe type of treatment is shown as a percentage of total treatment and the treated amounts in kg per capita. The per capita values were calculated as a weighted average over all countries within each group, i.e. the total amounts treated per category were added for all countries per group in million tonnes and divided by the sum of the overall inhabitants per group and year. For better comparison, the graphs were scaled identically.\nIt can be seen that the figures in kg per capita confirm the finding mentioned above, i.e. that in countries with high landfill rates the total amounts treated in kg per capita in 2009 are lower than in countries with low landfill rates. In 2009, the treated amount per capita was 341 kg in group 3 compared with 554 kg in group 1 and 550 kg in group 2. The developments over time even suggest that the overall increase from 1995 to 2009 was larger in groups 1 (10\u00a0%) and 2 (22\u00a0%) than in group 3 (8\u00a0%). Thus, group 2 shows the largest amounts in 2009 and the largest growth, while for group 3 the opposite is the case.\nGroups 1 and 2 show a similar development with regard to the absolute reduction of the percentage landfilled. In group 1, the landfill rate decreased from 42\u00a0% to 11\u00a0%. In group 2, the share of waste landfilled fell from 86\u00a0% to 49\u00a0%, mainly due to the enormous increase in composting from 1\u00a0% to 23\u00a0%. However, this increase must be interpreted with caution as 51\u00a0% of the value is from composting in Italy, known to contain largely amounts that were in fact treated by mechanical-biological facilities. Group 3 achieved an absolute reduction of 8\u00a0% (from 97\u00a0% 1995 to 89\u00a0% in 2009).\nConsidering the much lower starting level of group 1 for waste landfilled, the relative reduction of the landfill rates was by far the highest in this group (73\u00a0%, from 215 to 59 kg per capita). In group 2, the reduction in landfilling amounted to 30\u00a0% (from 387 in 1995 to 270 kg per capita in 2009), while in group 3, the amounts landfilled in 2009 (302 kg per capita) were almost equal to those in 1995 (304 kg per capita).\nAlthough the total amount of municipal waste treated per capita in 2009 is much higher in group 2 than in group 3, the per capita amounts of municipal waste landfilled in 2009 are not very different in both groups, with 270 kg and 302 kg per capita respectively. In contrast to this, group 1 countries managed to reduce the already low amounts landfilled in 1995 further until 2009, mainly by recycling and composting with increases overall of 116\u00a0% and 68\u00a0%. Progress with regard to material recovery and incineration was low in group 3 in absolute terms and cannot easily be identified in the graph. The largest increase from 1995 to 2009 occurred for recycling by a factor of 8 from 2.4 to 19.3 kg per capita, followed by the amounts incinerated (2.7 to 10.1 kg per capita; factor of 3.7).\nThe results can be summarised as follows:\nin several countries belonging to group 1 national measure were introduced to limit the landfilling of municipal waste, which has most likely contributed to the high increase in recycling, composting and incineration;\ncountries belonging to group 2 have set up some measures to divert municipal waste from landfilling, and the trend is pointing into the right direction;\nexcept for Estonia and Slovenia, all 'new' Member States are in group 3, only limited progress in diverting municipal waste from being landfilled can be observed; however, the generated amounts of municipal waste are notable lower than in the countries of the other two groups;\nGreece and Portugal lag behind the development in other 'old' Member States.\nMunicipal waste generated and economic development in Europe\nTable 2: Municipal waste generated, population and GDP in the EU-27 from 1995 to 2009 - Source: Eurostat (env_wasmun) (demo_gind) and (nama_gdp_k)\nFigure 7: Municipal waste generated, population and GDP in the EU-27 from 1995 to 2009 (1995=100) - Source: Eurostat (env_wasmun) (demo_gind) and (nama_gdp_k)\nTable 2 shows the data aggregates for the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU-27) for municipal waste generation, population and selected economic parameters.\nGross domestic product (GDP) is used as an economic parameter and a driver of municipal waste generation. The table shows municipal waste generated in tonnes as well as per capita. The development since 1995 is illustrated in Figure 7.\nSince 1995, the generation of municipal waste in the EU-27 has shown a steady increase until 2002. In this period, municipal waste generation grew by 29.1 million tonnes, or 13\u00a0%, from 226.5 million tonnes to 255.6 million tonnes. This corresponds to an average annual growth rate of 1.7\u00a0%. In 2003 and 2004, this growth trend was interrupted, which can to some extent be attributed to the changes of methodology and classifications which reportedly took place in many countries in the period around 2002.\nThis decrease was followed by a further rise from 2004 to 2007 by 8.1 million tonnes, to 260.0 million tonnes, followed by a decrease in 2008 (258.9 million tonnes) and another in 2009, to 256 million tonnes.\nUp to 2002, the increase in waste generation exceeded the population growth. Accordingly, the population-related indicator on municipal waste generated also increased. The indicator grew at an average rate of 1.5\u00a0% per year from 474 kg per capita in 1995 to 526 kg per capita in 2002. In 2003 the indicator fell to 514 kg per capita. The subsequent increase to 523 kg per capita in 2007 did not raise the indicator above the level of 2002. Up until 2009, the indicator decreased to 512 kg per capita, i.e. approximately to the level of 2004.\nThe drop in 2009 after steady growth from 2003 to 2008 was also observed in many countries\u2019 series. It was explained by the positive economic development in this period until 2008 followed by the 2009 decline.\nAt the EU-27 level, GDP shows an increasing trend with an annual growth rate of 2.3\u00a0% in the period from 1995 to 2008. Annual economic growth thus clearly exceeded that of municipal waste generation in the same period (1.0\u00a0%). Particularly between 2002 and 2008, economic growth was much higher than that of municipal waste generation (0.2\u00a0%). The relation between economic development and municipal waste generation is illustrated by the line 'MW generation per EUR (GDP)', i.e. a moderate decline until 2002 by 0.8\u00a0% per\u00a0year and a sharp decline by 1.8\u00a0% per year between 2002 and 2008. In 2009, the economic decline was even sharper than that of waste generation, leading to an increasing value back to the level of 2006 (24.8 kg per EUR).\nThese figures are not yet sufficient to conclude that municipal waste generation in the European Union has reached its peak. This is particularly true because the aggregates for 2009 are to some extent based on provisional data or estimates. Nevertheless, the figures do indicate that municipal waste generation in the European Union has slowed down since 2002.\nData sources and availability\nAll the data presented here were collected by Eurostat. Since the beginning of the 1990s Eurostat has conducted surveys on European waste data using the OECD /Eurostat-Joint Questionnaire as the main source. Starting from 2004 as the first reference year, Regulation 2150/2002 on waste statistics replaced in principle the data collection based on the Joint Questionnaire. In order to maintain the time series and to offer consistent data in an international context outside the EU (OECD, UN ), the small set of variables on municipal waste presented in this statistical article is still collected annually on the basis of a subset of the OECD/Eurostat Joint Questionnaire.\nThe data were extracted from the Eurostat database on 12 April 2011. Average population values (extracted on 21 April 2011) were used to calculate kilogram per capita. For the GDP, again extracted on 21 April 2011, the data were used in euro as chain-linked volumes, reference year 2000 (at 2000 exchange rates).\nDefinitions\nThe municipal waste classification is based on the definitions for the section on waste in the OECD/Eurostat Joint Questionnaire, briefly summarised (more extensive information is available in the ESMS metadata sheet on municipal waste ).\nMW generated / MW collected The data refer to the amount of municipal waste generated. In countries with complete (national) coverage of their municipal waste collection scheme the total of municipal waste generated is equal to the total of municipal waste collected. Some countries do not cover the whole territory with a collection scheme. These countries have added an estimation of the waste generated in the areas not covered. Only Lithuania was not able to offer such estimation for the latest data. The Lithuanian data only refer to municipal waste collected.\nData include the overseas departments (d\u00e9partement d\u2019outre-mer or DOM) Martinique, Guadeloupe, R\u00e9union and French Guiana.\nData for Cyprus refer only to the area under effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.\nData include Liechtenstein.\nContext\nMunicipal waste constitutes only around 10\u00a0% of total waste generated. However, the political emphasis on municipal waste is very high because of its complex character due to its composition, its distribution among many waste generators and its link to consumption patterns.\nAll the data presented here were collected by Eurostat. Since the beginning of the 1990s Eurostat has conducted surveys on European waste data using the OECD/Eurostat-Joint Questionnaire as the main source. Starting from 2004 as the first reference year, Regulation 2150/2002 of 25 November 2002 on waste statistics replaced in principle the data collection based on the Joint Questionnaire. In order to maintain the time series and to offer consistent data in an international context outside the EU (OECD, UN), the small set of variables on municipal waste presented in this statistical article is still collected annually on the basis of a subset of the OECD/Eurostat Joint Questionnaire.\nFurther Eurostat information\n"}, {"score": 906.353, "uuid": "21f8403f-de6f-50da-ba98-029547cfbe91", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1800wb-87-15753", "target_hostname": "www.town.windsor.ns.ca", "target_uri": "http://www.town.windsor.ns.ca/waste.html", "page_rank": 4.0415795e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "<em>Waste</em> | Town of Windsor", "snippet": "Council <em>and</em> staff <em>are</em> very proud of Windsor residents <em>and</em> businesses in your efforts to reduce <em>waste</em> going to <em>the</em> landfill by separating organics, recyclables <em>and</em> garbage.", "explanation": null, "document": "Solid Waste\nWindsor Enviro-Depot (on Albert St)\nThe Windsor Enviro Depot (located on Albert St) will be closed from March 29 to April 9 inclusive.\u00a0 It will re-open on Tuesday, April 10th.\n2012 Solid Waste Collection Schedule & Sorting Guide\nThe 2012 Windsor Solid Waste Collection Calendar & Sorting Guide (215.37 kB) is available on-line and went out in the mail in December 2011.\nNOTE: The schedule and guide were formatted for 8.5\" x 14\" (legal-size) paper.\u00a0 Should you wish to print this off, be sure your printer is configured appropriately.\nRecycling Process\nThis video represents why sorting our recyclables at home (where it is generated) is so important.\u00a0 You will see in this video a brief clip of the sorting process once it reaches our recycling facility in Colchester.\nThe workers are continuously sorting, non-stop.\u00a0 Workers captured in this video are just sorting from Bag 1 contents (tin, plastics, glass jars).\u00a0 This sorting line does not capture any of Bag 2 contents (paper & boxboard).\nTOWN OF WINDSOR RECYCLABLES COLLECTION \u2013 DID YOU KNOW??????\nQuick & easy \u201crecycling\u201d facts to make Windsor\u2019s Curbside Recycling Collection Program a success\u2026\n1. \u00a0\u00a0 There are 2 bags for recycling.

The RSE is Scotland\u2019s premier Learned Society, comprising Fellows elected on the basis of their distinction, from the full range of academic disciplines, and from industry, commerce and the professions. This response has been compiled with the assistance of a number of Fellows with direct experience of environmental and waste management issues.\nAt first sight the title of the document appears to be offering a comprehensive treatment of the issue of waste management. It was disappointing, therefore, to discover that the scope of the document (para. 1.4) was limited, with subjects such as radioactive wastes and discharges to air and water only mentioned in passing. Their omission is especially surprising given the references to air and water in Table 1, Schedule 12, Objectives (para. l. l0), and SEPA\u2019s recent launch of its report on Improving Scotland\u2019s Water Environment. A National Strategy should be integrated and include the disposal of radioactive wastes (an important category in the Scottish context), the critically important subjects of liquid and gaseous wastes (the most dynamic and potentially hazardous categories) and all waste releases to the hydrosphere and atmosphere (including rivers, lochs/lakes, estuaries, seas and oceans). Another important factor, which a National Waste Strategy should include, is a strategy for the environmental monitoring, impact assessment and auditing of waste disposal sites to ensure their compliance with acceptable and pre-defined risk factors to humans, flora and fauna. The Society would advocate the inclusion of the above areas for a comprehensive, forward-thinking strategy for Scotland.\nThe topics addressed in the document are, however, covered comprehensively, well researched and include sound proposals for future strategies and actions. If eventually fully implemented, these could be of very significant benefit, not least in achieving economies in resource use and reducing adverse effects of waste disposal on the environment. The key to achieving the outlined strategies, however, will be to convince all sections of the community of the need for change with a series of success stories to sell the concepts. Simply highlighting EU legislation will not be sufficient in itself and the document could give greater emphasis to the important requirement to educate business and domestic waste-makers on why change is essential.\nThe specific questions raised in the consultation document are addressed below:\nQuestion 1: Landfill capacity (p.9)\nDo you consider a rolling 5-year future licensed landfill bank to be adequate?\nProbably yes, as a rolling policy there should always be a minimal five year\u2019s capacity coming on stream. However, the capacity must be sufficient to meet expected demand, which should gradually decrease as waste re-use strategies come into operation. In creating this capacity, however, a five year rolling programme might be too tight a timescale, given the need to identify suitable sites, allow time for purchase, obtain planning permissions, and establish acceptable infrastructure requirements, for example, roads. In this respect, perhaps a 10-year perspective would be a preferable time frame for a sustainable long-term policy.\nShould different provision be made for different types of landfill operation (bio-degradable/inert)?\nYes, different wastes will degrade at different rates and for planning purposes the separation of wastes into half-life categories would be sensible, as would separation based upon chemical, physical and biological properties, potential leachability and potential environmental impact. This could influence the period of use and re-use of sites, and be valuable if the treatment of one type of waste was cheaper than another.\nIn terms of biodegradable waste, it seems unlikely that composting, with current technology, can process all biodegradable waste and future research into large scale composting in landfills could provide a means for managing the large amount of waste of this type. 'Contamination' with inert waste would be inimical to this and therefore separation in different classes of landfills would be essential. However, the real problem is that most waste is mixed and not homogeneous.\nShould this forward capacity be maintained on an area by area basis or as an all Scotland average?\nWaste production is generally a function of population size and will vary considerably between areas of high and low concentrations of population. It will also depend on types of industrial and commercial activities. It is, therefore, concentrated in specific areas which will normally require local solutions. An area-by-area basis would be preferable for non-hazardous wastes to avoid excessive transportation. However, specialised central disposal sites will be necessary for more hazardous disposals.\nQuestion 2: Additional Statutory Powers (p.27)\nDo you consider that additional statutory powers as discussed above will be necessary to ensure the strategy is made to work effectively?\nYes, the additional powers will be necessary if the objectives set out in Table 1 (para. 1.4) are to beachieved throughout the country. Reliance on market response and the voluntary principle is likely to be inadequate, or at the best patchy, and there will be many reasons and ways used by the producers of waste to slow down implementation of the strategy. By having a strong and effective regulatory system this will be minimised.\nAre there any additional powers that you consider may be necessary?\nIn addition to those additional powers identified in the draft strategy, SEPA should have powers to ensure environmental survey, monitoring, assessment and compliance by an independent body or bodies.\nDo you consider a target trading mechanism between the different areas of Scotland could be an effective and flexible way of achieving the targets nationally?\nIt could be argued that a target trading mechanism misses the point of the exercise, in that by permitting an area to exceed its target it thereby fails to establish the culture intended by the strategy for that area. Target trading would also be complicated by the trans-boundary movement of liquid and gaseous discharges and because many hazardous wastes will require centralised or regional disposals.\nThe operation of any target trading mechanism would need to include a compliance and environmental policing component to ensure that no credit was given to disposers who generated low audited environmental health impacts. It would also need to be expensive enough to ensure that trading was not a soft option chosen by a particular Authority in preference to positive action to implement locally agreed strategies.\nQuestion 3: Targets (p.34)\nIs the range of targets in Table 5 appropriate?\nThe targets seem to be realistic and, if adhered to, should make an appreciable difference. The costs of meeting these targets, however, are likely to be substantial. Most of these extra costs will fall on local authorities and for the targets to be met local authorities must be allowed the resources to meet this cost, either by central funding or by local levies on domestic and commercial waste makers.\nAre there any additional targets you would consider necessary?\nThe strategy should include integrated targets for gaseous, liquid and solid waste disposals to atmosphere, hydrosphere and land, as well as for the crucial area of radioactive wastes. There should also be independent environmental monitoring, audit, impact assessment and compliance-proving targets.\nQuestion 4: Waste Strategy Areas (p.40)\nDo the areas outlined provide an adequate basis for strategic waste planning in Scotland?\nWaste Strategy Areas should be based around existing Local Authority Areas to minimise administrative difficulties and arguments over allocation of costs. Ideally there should be fewer areas than those outlined, thereby increasing the possibility of more uniform procedures and strategy implementation. However, in practice it might be necessary to increase the number, or at least to redraw some boundaries. For example, the proposal to include Scottish Borders with connurbationsin the Central Belt is likely to prove problematic, given the disparity in volumes and types of waste involved and thus the differing methods and scale of waste disposal required. Perhaps the Borders would be better grouped with Dumfries and Galloway in this regard. On the other hand, perhaps Fife could be included in the Stirling, Clackmannanshire and Falkirk Waste Strategy Area (WSA). In identifying these areas it would be useful if Table 6 indicated the areas and populations of the WSA\u2019s.\nShould there be fewer or more areas?\nAs noted above, there should ideally be fewer areas to increase the possibility of more uniform procedures and strategy implementation.\nQuestion 5: Priority Waste Streams (p.43)\nDo you consider that the principle of studying specific waste streams in terms of their specific requirements is a useful way forward for certain wastes?\nYes, the principle of studying specific waste streams is a good one as no general solution is likely.\nWhat other waste streams do you consider might require specific attention at a national rather than area level in the future?\nAdditional waste streams which would require specific attention at a national level include high level radioactive wastes and toxic chemical wastes such as sheep dip.\nThe problem of litter and other discarded waste plastic and metal objects in the countryside and on the beaches would also be worth consideration. Although recognising the difficulties involved, this is the most visible waste problem and of considerable concern to most of the public.\nQuestion 6: Landfill Tax Credit Scheme (p.49)\nCould improved value in support of the strategy\u2019s objectives be gained from the landfill tax credit scheme?\nThe Landfill Tax Credit Scheme is a valuable source of support for environmental improvement measures. It could, however, be further developed and improved. For example, the Tax Credit could work in both directions. Tax Credits, as described, could be given to landfill operators, but more importantly perhaps, additional credits could be awarded to those disposing of waste to reward efficiency, re-use, good practice, etc. It would also be important to build in environmental monitoring, audit, impact assessment and compliance-proving into the credit system.\nIn terms of supporting the strategy\u2019s objectives, a proportion of the Tax Credits obtained could be targeted on relevant research projects in support of priority waste stream projects and basic fundamental work in these areas.\nQuestion 7: Research & Development proposals (p.52)\nDo you consider the R&D activities indicated here are appropriate to support the development of the strategy?\nSubstantial further research is required along the lines indicated and it is to be hoped that SEPA will be very active in influencing and promoting this. There is a clear case for UK-wide collaboration on these R&D topics and the statements in 4.74 (page 51) are welcome as recognition of this. While the topics listed are all worthy of support, with limited funds available some prioritisation may be necessary with research into BPEO Methodology Development, Promotion and Education, Clean Technology and developing incentives for waste producers being particularly relevant.\nWhat additional issues do you consider important for R&D in the future?\nAdditional important issues for R&D include:\nR&D related to disposals of liquid, gaseous and radioactive wastes to the hydrosphere, atmosphere and land.\nR&D into environmental audit, policing and compliance.\nRetrospective studies of past disposals, i.e. to map and document these, make current environmental audits, reassess waste condition and hazard potential, and develop future strategies for each site.\nThe role of incentives and financial inducements to encourage both waste producers and non-profit making organisations to play a more active part.\nResearch into degradation, particularly biodegradation, is needed to improve the microbiology of composting in the complex landfill site environments.\nIssues relating to hygiene and safety of food packaging with a view to substantially reducing the use of bulky packaging materials.\nBetter use of landfill methane (this is largely a microbiological issue in that higher methane yields could be envisaged).\nThe possibility of building into (and recovering from) the material cost of an item, the costs of its recycling and disposal. This could recover the waste disposal costs from the specific products which are the most expensive to dispose of, and the consumers who use them.\nAdditional Information\nIn responding to this inquiry the Society would like to draw attention to the following Royal Society of Edinburgh publication which is of relevance to this subject: Basic Safety Standards Directive Euratom 96/29 (June 1999).\nFurther information is available from the Research Officer, Dr Marc Rands\nFollow Us:\nThe Royal Society Of Edinburgh\n22-26 George Street, Edinburgh, EH2 2PQ\nT +44 131 240 5000\nF +44 131 240 5024\n"}, {"score": 893.43134, "uuid": "9c21eacf-29b7-59ad-9c1f-06d74e9f9761", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1000wb-02-05148", "target_hostname": "www.zerowastescotland.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/content/anaerobic-digestion-0", "page_rank": 1.1858344e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "Anaerobic digestion | Zero <em>Waste</em> Scotland", "snippet": "There <em>are</em> two main types of anaerobic digestion called thermophilic <em>and</em> mesophilic \u2013 <em>the</em> primary <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> them is <em>the</em> temperatures reached in <em>the</em> process.

Thermophilic processes reach temperatures of up to 60\u00b0C and mesophilic normally runs at about 35-40\u00b0C.\nAD sites also have to comply with the Animal By Products regulations so a mesophilic site would also have a pasteurisation unit to make sure the end product is safe.\nWhich method to choose\nThe system chosen will largely depend on the feedstock to be processed.

Other possible uses for the biogas currently being explored in the UK include injection to the gas grid and using it as a vehicle fuel.\nA further by-product of the process is biofertiliser, which is rich in nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and other elements required for healthy plant growth and fertile soil.\nThe process\n"}], [{"score": 893.1058, "uuid": "1066bb68-eb4e-5d1c-875a-c7c78e89d3df", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0211wb-68-17030", "target_hostname": "www.rse.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.rse.org.uk/460_NATIONALWASTESTRATEGYSCOTLAND.html", "page_rank": 1.1755215e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "<em>The</em> Royal Society of Edinburgh | NATIONAL <em>WASTE</em> STRATEGY: SCOTLAND", "snippet": "<em>The</em> targets seem to be realistic <em>and</em>, if adhered to, should make an appreciable <em>difference</em>. <em>The</em> costs of meeting these targets, however, <em>are</em> likely to be substantial.", "explanation": null, "document": "NATIONAL WASTE STRATEGY: SCOTLAND\nNATIONAL WASTE STRATEGY: SCOTLAND\nThe Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE) is pleased to respond to the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (SEPA) consultation on Scotland\u2019s National Waste Strategy. The RSE is Scotland\u2019s premier Learned Society, comprising Fellows elected on the basis of their distinction, from the full range of academic disciplines, and from industry, commerce and the professions. This response has been compiled with the assistance of a number of Fellows with direct experience of environmental and waste management issues.\nAt first sight the title of the document appears to be offering a comprehensive treatment of the issue of waste management. It was disappointing, therefore, to discover that the scope of the document (para. 1.4) was limited, with subjects such as radioactive wastes and discharges to air and water only mentioned in passing. Their omission is especially surprising given the references to air and water in Table 1, Schedule 12, Objectives (para. l. l0), and SEPA\u2019s recent launch of its report on Improving Scotland\u2019s Water Environment. A National Strategy should be integrated and include the disposal of radioactive wastes (an important category in the Scottish context), the critically important subjects of liquid and gaseous wastes (the most dynamic and potentially hazardous categories) and all waste releases to the hydrosphere and atmosphere (including rivers, lochs/lakes, estuaries, seas and oceans). Another important factor, which a National Waste Strategy should include, is a strategy for the environmental monitoring, impact assessment and auditing of waste disposal sites to ensure their compliance with acceptable and pre-defined risk factors to humans, flora and fauna. The Society would advocate the inclusion of the above areas for a comprehensive, forward-thinking strategy for Scotland.\nThe topics addressed in the document are, however, covered comprehensively, well researched and include sound proposals for future strategies and actions. If eventually fully implemented, these could be of very significant benefit, not least in achieving economies in resource use and reducing adverse effects of waste disposal on the environment. The key to achieving the outlined strategies, however, will be to convince all sections of the community of the need for change with a series of success stories to sell the concepts. Simply highlighting EU legislation will not be sufficient in itself and the document could give greater emphasis to the important requirement to educate business and domestic waste-makers on why change is essential.\nThe specific questions raised in the consultation document are addressed below:\nQuestion 1: Landfill capacity (p.9)\nDo you consider a rolling 5-year future licensed landfill bank to be adequate?\nProbably yes, as a rolling policy there should always be a minimal five year\u2019s capacity coming on stream. However, the capacity must be sufficient to meet expected demand, which should gradually decrease as waste re-use strategies come into operation. In creating this capacity, however, a five year rolling programme might be too tight a timescale, given the need to identify suitable sites, allow time for purchase, obtain planning permissions, and establish acceptable infrastructure requirements, for example, roads. In this respect, perhaps a 10-year perspective would be a preferable time frame for a sustainable long-term policy.\nShould different provision be made for different types of landfill operation (bio-degradable/inert)?\nYes, different wastes will degrade at different rates and for planning purposes the separation of wastes into half-life categories would be sensible, as would separation based upon chemical, physical and biological properties, potential leachability and potential environmental impact. This could influence the period of use and re-use of sites, and be valuable if the treatment of one type of waste was cheaper than another.\nIn terms of biodegradable waste, it seems unlikely that composting, with current technology, can process all biodegradable waste and future research into large scale composting in landfills could provide a means for managing the large amount of waste of this type. 'Contamination' with inert waste would be inimical to this and therefore separation in different classes of landfills would be essential. However, the real problem is that most waste is mixed and not homogeneous.\nShould this forward capacity be maintained on an area by area basis or as an all Scotland average?\nWaste production is generally a function of population size and will vary considerably between areas of high and low concentrations of population. It will also depend on types of industrial and commercial activities. It is, therefore, concentrated in specific areas which will normally require local solutions. An area-by-area basis would be preferable for non-hazardous wastes to avoid excessive transportation. However, specialised central disposal sites will be necessary for more hazardous disposals.\nQuestion 2: Additional Statutory Powers (p.27)\nDo you consider that additional statutory powers as discussed above will be necessary to ensure the strategy is made to work effectively?\nYes, the additional powers will be necessary if the objectives set out in Table 1 (para. 1.4) are to beachieved throughout the country. Reliance on market response and the voluntary principle is likely to be inadequate, or at the best patchy, and there will be many reasons and ways used by the producers of waste to slow down implementation of the strategy. By having a strong and effective regulatory system this will be minimised.\nAre there any additional powers that you consider may be necessary?\nIn addition to those additional powers identified in the draft strategy, SEPA should have powers to ensure environmental survey, monitoring, assessment and compliance by an independent body or bodies.\nDo you consider a target trading mechanism between the different areas of Scotland could be an effective and flexible way of achieving the targets nationally?\nIt could be argued that a target trading mechanism misses the point of the exercise, in that by permitting an area to exceed its target it thereby fails to establish the culture intended by the strategy for that area. Target trading would also be complicated by the trans-boundary movement of liquid and gaseous discharges and because many hazardous wastes will require centralised or regional disposals.\nThe operation of any target trading mechanism would need to include a compliance and environmental policing component to ensure that no credit was given to disposers who generated low audited environmental health impacts. It would also need to be expensive enough to ensure that trading was not a soft option chosen by a particular Authority in preference to positive action to implement locally agreed strategies.\nQuestion 3: Targets (p.34)\nIs the range of targets in Table 5 appropriate?\nThe targets seem to be realistic and, if adhered to, should make an appreciable difference. The costs of meeting these targets, however, are likely to be substantial. Most of these extra costs will fall on local authorities and for the targets to be met local authorities must be allowed the resources to meet this cost, either by central funding or by local levies on domestic and commercial waste makers.\nAre there any additional targets you would consider necessary?\nThe strategy should include integrated targets for gaseous, liquid and solid waste disposals to atmosphere, hydrosphere and land, as well as for the crucial area of radioactive wastes. There should also be independent environmental monitoring, audit, impact assessment and compliance-proving targets.\nQuestion 4: Waste Strategy Areas (p.40)\nDo the areas outlined provide an adequate basis for strategic waste planning in Scotland?\nWaste Strategy Areas should be based around existing Local Authority Areas to minimise administrative difficulties and arguments over allocation of costs. Ideally there should be fewer areas than those outlined, thereby increasing the possibility of more uniform procedures and strategy implementation. However, in practice it might be necessary to increase the number, or at least to redraw some boundaries. For example, the proposal to include Scottish Borders with connurbationsin the Central Belt is likely to prove problematic, given the disparity in volumes and types of waste involved and thus the differing methods and scale of waste disposal required. Perhaps the Borders would be better grouped with Dumfries and Galloway in this regard. On the other hand, perhaps Fife could be included in the Stirling, Clackmannanshire and Falkirk Waste Strategy Area (WSA). In identifying these areas it would be useful if Table 6 indicated the areas and populations of the WSA\u2019s.\nShould there be fewer or more areas?\nAs noted above, there should ideally be fewer areas to increase the possibility of more uniform procedures and strategy implementation.\nQuestion 5: Priority Waste Streams (p.43)\nDo you consider that the principle of studying specific waste streams in terms of their specific requirements is a useful way forward for certain wastes?\nYes, the principle of studying specific waste streams is a good one as no general solution is likely.\nWhat other waste streams do you consider might require specific attention at a national rather than area level in the future?\nAdditional waste streams which would require specific attention at a national level include high level radioactive wastes and toxic chemical wastes such as sheep dip.\nThe problem of litter and other discarded waste plastic and metal objects in the countryside and on the beaches would also be worth consideration. Although recognising the difficulties involved, this is the most visible waste problem and of considerable concern to most of the public.\nQuestion 6: Landfill Tax Credit Scheme (p.49)\nCould improved value in support of the strategy\u2019s objectives be gained from the landfill tax credit scheme?\nThe Landfill Tax Credit Scheme is a valuable source of support for environmental improvement measures. It could, however, be further developed and improved. For example, the Tax Credit could work in both directions. Tax Credits, as described, could be given to landfill operators, but more importantly perhaps, additional credits could be awarded to those disposing of waste to reward efficiency, re-use, good practice, etc. It would also be important to build in environmental monitoring, audit, impact assessment and compliance-proving into the credit system.\nIn terms of supporting the strategy\u2019s objectives, a proportion of the Tax Credits obtained could be targeted on relevant research projects in support of priority waste stream projects and basic fundamental work in these areas.\nQuestion 7: Research & Development proposals (p.52)\nDo you consider the R&D activities indicated here are appropriate to support the development of the strategy?\nSubstantial further research is required along the lines indicated and it is to be hoped that SEPA will be very active in influencing and promoting this.

Specific policy documents include:\nA National Policy Statement on Waste Management \u201cChanging Our Ways\u201d, issued in September 1998.\nA Supplementary Policy Statement \u201cDelivering Change\u201d dedicated to the higher priority waste management practices of Prevention, Re-Use and Recycling, issued in March 2002.\nA National Hazardous Waste Management Plan designed to prevent and manage hazardous waste, adopted in July 2001.\nA National Sustainable Development Strategy \u201cSustainable Development: A Strategy for Ireland\u201d, issued in 1997 and supplemented by \u201cMaking Ireland\u2018s Development Sustainable: Review, Assessment and Future Action\u201d issued in August 2002.\nA National Climate Change Strategy, issued in October 2000 and Supplemented by a Progress Report on the Implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy issued in May 2002.\nWaste Management Taking stock and Moving Forward (April 2004).\nConsultation document on Biodegradable Waste.\nOther important steps have also been taken to stem the growth of waste. The legislative framework has been strengthened by the Environmental Protection Agency Act (1992), the Waste Management Acts (1996 to 2003), as well as several other Regulations. The setting up of an Office of Environmental Enforcement in October 2003 is designed to improve enforcement of such legislation. Economic instruments have been applied, including the landfill levy, plastic bags levy and the setting up of the Environment Fund. Awareness levels are rising through the It\u2018s Easy to Make a Difference campaign, the Race Against Waste Programme, ENFO and locally by Local Agenda 21 and Environmental Education Officers, the Green Flag Programme etc.\n3.2.1 Changing Our Ways, 1998\nThe policy document Changing Our Ways, sets out national recovery, recycling and diversion from landfill targets, and discusses the changing role of the local authority in waste management. Emphasis is, in addition, placed on the Polluter Pays Principle, and waste related charges. The most important targets and performance indicators identified in this policy statement include:\nDiversion of 50% of overall household waste from landfill;\nReduction, by a minimum of 65%, of the biodegradable wastes consigned to landfill;\nRecycling of 35% of Municipal Solid Waste;\nDevelopment of composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum;\n80% reduction in methane emissions from landfill;\nRationalisation of the country\u2019s 100 landfills to approximately 20 state-of-the-art facilities.\n3.2.2 Delivering Change, 2002 :\nThe 2002 supplementary policy statement Delivering Change is dedicated to the higher priority waste management practices of Prevention, Re-Use and Recycling. It evolved from and is grounded in the 1998 policy statement Changing Our Ways and aims to ensure that Ireland meets the targets it contained by positive and effective actions including organisational change\nThe document\nhighlights the necessary disciplines that must be imposed within waste management systems to secure real progress on waste prevention, re-use and recovery;\noutlines a range of measures that will be undertaken in the interests of minimising waste generation and ensuring a sustained expansion in re-use and recycling performance; and\nidentifies issues and possible actions that require further systematic consideration.\ncommits to the setting up of a National Waste Management Board in 2002 to co-ordinate, monitor, review and advise on all aspects of waste management policy at all levels of the waste hierarchy.\n3.2.2(a) Prevention and Minimisation\nDelivering Change commits to:\nThe establishment of a well-resourced National Waste Prevention Programme (NWPP) to deliver substantial results on waste prevention and minimisation;\nThe establishment of a \u201cCore Prevention Team\u201d (CPT) within the EPA to drive this initiative;\nThe establishment of a Prevention Programme Steering Group, that will co-ordinate/liase with public authorities at all levels, monitor the overall thrust of the National Waste Prevention Programme, and provide strategic direction to the Core Prevention Team;\nThe introduction of a system of mandatory waste audits and waste reduction programmes for businesses which fall below the threshold for Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control licensing.\n3.2.2(b) Reuse:\nThe implementation of a 15 cent levy on plastic shopping bags and encouragement of their substitution by re-usable bags;\n3.2.2(c) Recycling:\nThe establishment of a Recycling Consultative Forum to be supported by the National Waste Management Board, and to act as a consultative and advisory body on all aspects of recycling;\nThe provision of \u20ac127 million in EU/Exchequer support for waste recovery\ninfrastructure, including recycling infrastructure, in the period 2002 \u2013 2006;\nThe introduction of a landfill levy and the implementation of national bans on landfilling specific materials;\nThe utilisation of revenues from the new plastic bag and landfill levies, through the Environment Fund (provided for under the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001) to assist waste recycling activities;\nThe provision of \u20ac 0.635 million seed funding for establishment in 2002 of a Market Development Programme which will identify and promote markets for recyclable material;\n3.2.2(d) Producer Responsibility\nIn co-operation with business the Government will:\nPut in place measures to support Ireland\u2019s attainment of 50% recovery of packaging waste by 2005, (including dedicated arrangements for specific materials such as PET and Tetra Pak);\nCarry out a comprehensive review of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997;\nPut in place measures to ensure that end-of-life vehicles and waste electrical and electronic equipment are recovered and recycled in accordance with, and within the timescales set out in, the relevant EU Directives;\nPut in place an effective system to ensure that the recycling targets for Construction and Demolition Waste, of 50% by 2003 and 85% by 2013, are met by the construction industry;\nEstablish producer responsibility initiatives in 2002 to recycle newsprint, tyres and batteries;\nWhere necessary, require problematic sectors to introduce waste recovery schemes using powers under the Waste Management Acts;\nEnsure an effective enforcement regime for Regulations made under the Waste Management Acts in support of producer responsibility initiatives;\nEstablish a Producer Responsibility Unit within the EPA to carry out research, monitor performance under specific producer responsibility initiatives, and secure better enforcement and promote good practice.\n3.2.2(e) Biological Treatment of Organic Waste\nDraw up a National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste in the Municipal Waste Stream\nSupport the provision by local authorities of infrastructure for the biological treatment of organic waste;\nIntroduce product standards for compost derived from municipal waste;\nEncourage the development of markets for those products;\nSupport the development of widespread home composting.\n3.2.2(f) Public Service Waste Management Programme\nThe Government will:\nDevelop a public service waste management programme;\nPromote, in particular, the use of recycled material in public procurement policies, including ensuring that within 2 years, all public authorities use recycled paper for routine use;\nStrengthen the green networks that exist between Government Departments and between local authority Environmental Awareness officers.\n3.3 Irish Waste Management Legislation\nA significant amount of Irish waste management legislation is now in place, much of which requires implementation by or with the involvement of local authorities. Much of such legislation is complex and wide ranging covering issues such as waste management (collection, recovery, disposal, etc.); transfrontier shipment; hazardous waste management and movement; packaging waste; licensing; permitting and littering; also specific waste streams such as sludges, farm plastics, etc.\nA brief outline of some of this legislation follows.\n3.3.1 Waste Management Acts 1996 \u2013 2003\nThe purpose of the Waste Management Acts, 1996 to 2003 is to provide a modern and comprehensive legislative framework for the prevention, management and control of waste. A system of licensing is being implemented for waste management facilities, but the Act does not apply to emissions that are already taken care of under separate controls such as emissions to atmosphere, sewage and other effluents. The Acts place an onus on persons to handle waste including its disposal in such a way as not to cause environmental pollution.\nThe waste management Act 1996 provides inter alia for\nThe making by a local authority of a waste management ;\nLocal authorities to collect or arrange for the collection of domestic waste and provide or make provision for the disposal of same. Local authorities may collect commercial waste;\nMeasures for the prevention and minimisation of waste production including making regulations for control and management of various types of waste streams;\nThe nature, composition or design and the uses of packaging;\nVarious enforcement duties in relation to waste by local authorities\nLicencing of waste recyling, storage and disposal facilities\nThe Waste Management Act, 1996 (S.I. No. 10 of 1996) was amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000 (No. 30 of 2000). The Act introduces new provisions governing the interface between planning control and licensing in relation to development under the Waste Management Act, 1996. At present only the EPA can comment on environmental issues in relation to such development. Under the Act, An Bord Plean\u00e1la and the planning authority will be allowed to take environmental issues into account in deciding whether to grant permission or not to a licensed activity. However, they cannot impose conditions on such a facility. This function remains for the EPA.\n3.3.2 Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001\nThe aims of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act, 2001 are:\n(a) to change the procedure for the adoption of regional waste management plans.\n(b )to introduce a landfill levy, at an initial rate of up to \u20ac19 per tonne.\n(c) to introduce a plastic shopping bag levy, of up to 19 c per bag.\n(d) to introduce a general clause to prohibit/limit the recovery/disposal of specified waste streams to specified types of facilities or in a specified manner. This clause can be utilised to ban landfill of certain wastes.\n(e) to establish an Environment Fund.\n3.3.3 Protection of the Environment Act 2003\nThe Protection of the Environment Act 2003 makes some changes to elements of the Waste Management Act 1996 including the following:\nlocal authorities are being given explicit power to discontinue the collection of domestic waste in the event of non-payment of charges and to set up a system of providing evidence of such payment\nlocal authorities have powers to impose, as an executive function, charges for the provision of any waste service\nthe variation or replacement of a waste management plan will become an executive function, i.e. a matter for local authority managers.\n3.3.4 National Hazardous Waste Management Plan\nA National Hazardous Waste Management Plan was published by the EPA in July 2001. This plan deals with the prevention and minimisation, recovery, collection, movement and disposal of hazardous waste. Local authorities must have regard to and implement relevant recommendations contained in the plan. The plan includes:\nA target for the reduction of hazardous waste disposal to 1996 levels by a date to be agreed via negotiation with relevant sectoral representatives.\nThe establishment of a Prevention Programme.\nDevelopment of hazardous waste disposal and recovery facilities, including hazardous waste landfill and thermal treatment to reduce export reliance.\nA target for the elimination of unreported hazardous waste.\nIdentification, prioritisation and remediation of historical hazardous waste disposal sites.\nImproved collection structure for household, agricultural and SME hazardous waste.\n3.4 Regulations under the Waste Management Acts\nThe following is a list of the main regulation made under the Waste Management Acts with a brief note on the main effects of the regulations. More detailed reference is made to the relevant regulations in the other chapters of this plan as necessary.\nWaste Management (Planning) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 137 of 1997): These Regulations specify matters to be addressed in local authority waste management plans.\nWaste Management (Register) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 183 of 1997): These Regulations prescribe information to be entered in public registers to be maintained by local authorities and the EPA.\nWaste Management (Farm plastics) Regulations, 1997 (S.I.

International experience has demonstrated that stakeholder commitment is best obtained and maintained via the development of targeted and continuous public awareness programmes. This information must convince waste producers of the benefits of avoiding waste production, and the negative environmental impacts of continuing current habits. As well as identifying the problem, however, this information must also include the solution to the problem \u2013 in other words, simple, easy-to-follow instructions identifying the most effective methods of avoiding waste.\nA great deal of emphasis is always placed on the ways in which municipal waste arisings are handled, treated and disposed of. A far more sustainable approach, however, would be to ensure that the waste is not generated in the first place (waste prevention). If it is not produced, it does not have to be managed \u2013 however, there will always be situations where some waste production is unavoidable. The best approach in the latter case would be to ensure that the quantity produced is as low as it can possibly be ( waste minimisation or reduction). This approach is also in accordance with EU and National Policy.\nAs well as targeting the actual quantities of waste produced in the city, it is also important that the pollution-potential of waste be reduced. This requires the substitution of hazardous materials with more environmentally friendly alternatives. This goal also requires specific, targeted public awareness efforts.\n4.2 Waste Avoidance\nReducing the amount or pollution-potential of municipal solid waste and the other wastes produced in a given area is a preventative action \u2013 and it thus has a fundamentally different function to waste management proper. Reducing waste quantities offers many potential benefits \u2013 e.g. fewer environmental problems with waste management, lower waste management costs, increased conservation, more efficient use of resources and increased public confidence in industry and government. The economic benefits of reduced raw material usage, lower energy requirements and less land utilisation for waste disposal activities are also significant.\nSeveral obstacles have inhibited substantial waste prevention and minimisation efforts to-date in Ireland, as well as in the rest of the developed world. Some of these are cultural or economic \u2013 and are thus market-driven. For example, there has been little onus on the manufacturers of products to minimise packaging, as the latter does not enter the waste stream for some time after the finished and packed product leaves the factory. The producer, in addition, tends to exploit the strong marketing link between attractive packaging (which often means more packaging) and consumer acceptance of a product. Consumers in addition have, until recently, given little thought to the need to buy products with less unnecessary packaging as there has been no financial incentive for them to do so.\nAnother barrier to waste prevention is our modern consumer\u2019s desire for convenience and disposable products. The latter can form a large proportion of the municipal solid waste stream but are difficult to eliminate as they serve a number of functions \u2013 including sanitation, theft prevention, public safety, weight reduction and customer appeal.\nConsumption and production patterns will only improve, however, as a result of significant behavioural and cultural changes, as well as economic considerations. The main ways in which these necessary changes can be made are if:\nPublic awareness of the issue is raised;\nGovernment (both central and local) generates guidelines or legislates for the prevention and minimisation of waste (for example, increasing landfill charges); and/ or\nThe manufacturers of products make significant efforts (either forced on them by legislation or economics, or pro-actively initiated) to reduce packaging levels. Experience has shown that there are substantial financial benefits to be gained from the stream-lining of industrial and manufacturing processes to facilitate the minimisation of waste generation.\nThe initiation of the REPAK scheme, together with a ban on certain waste streams from landfill, is currently effecting a reduction of wastes to landfill.\n4.3 Target Waste Producers\nThe goal of waste avoidance and reduction requires a long-term programme of public information, research and development, training events and pilot schemes. In addition, customised programmes for each of the different waste-producing sectors in the city are required. The results of such programmes, however, may require some time before they become measurable or tangible. This is particularly true of small individual waste producers such as householders and small businesses. It reflects the fact that the benefits of waste avoidance practices often accumulate only in small increments \u2013 which may in fact be so small as to be difficult to identify.\nIndustrial companies and other large waste producers often implement successful waste avoidance schemes relatively easily, on the other hand, reflecting the fact that the economies of scale involved make benefits more easily discernible at an earlier stage. This in turn makes such schemes more attractive to the company and more likely to be repeated.\nCork City Council recognises the individual needs of the different waste producers in the city and is committed to the development and dissemination of an aggressive long-term public awareness campaign highlighting waste avoidance measures specific to these sectors. These campaigns will target all waste producers but with particular emphasis on householders, businesses and Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs). The latter choice reflects the fact that larger industrial companies are often very pro-active in the implementation of waste avoidance measures as such activities are required by the EPA\u2019s licensing system 15 for large industrial activities and also by many quality and environment improvement standards.\n15 The Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) Licence System.\nSmaller industrial companies fall outside this licensing net and do not, therefore, have the same incentives and/ or information to avoid waste production. Similarly, householders often feel that the small amounts of waste that they produce are unimportant relative to industrial wastes generated in a given area, for example. However, this perception must change, as the combined small quantities of household waste produced in a city such as Cork usually comprise one of the biggest single waste streams entering municipal landfills.\nEffective waste avoidance requires habit-change, and can sometimes prove to be a slow and lengthy process. This acts as a disincentive for change. As tangible proof, therefore, of the City Council\u2019s commitment to waste reduction, the local authority will ensure that the waste avoidance measures communicated to the public by its information campaigns will also be fully and pro-actively adopted with respect to its own activities. In other words, Cork City Council must be treated like any other waste producer. Cork City Council thus has two main roles to fulfil with respect to its target of reducing the quantity of waste produced by Cork City. These are:\nTo support, encourage and promote waste avoidance measures; and\nTo ensure that City Hall produces less waste over the five-year period covered by this Plan.\n4.4 Waste Avoidance Measures Initiated by Cork City Council\nAlthough local authorities cannot significantly influence certain specific aspects of manufacturing and consumerism, the City Council can influence and guide the choices made by the public, manufacturers and landfill users in Cork City. The City Council plans, therefore, to continue and expand its current programme of disseminating waste avoidance information. In addition, a series of waste self-audits and information packs will be prepared to coincide with the needs of two specific waste producing sectors in the city \u2013 namely householders and SMEs. Waste reduction targets will also be encouraged for SMEs and hotels.\nAn aspirational target of reducing the quantity of industrial waste produced in the city by 10% is proposed by the City Council for the five-year period covered by this Plan. Whether or not such a target can be achieved, however, will depend on the commitment of the companies involved as well as their current baseline performance.Some of the methods by which the City Council has already promoted waste avoidance are summarised in the following paragraphs.\n4.4.1 Waste Avoidance Education and Initiatives for Schools\nCork City Council recognises the importance of targeting waste producers at the earliest possible age. To this end, it has pro-actively developed a programme of school\u2019s visits that involve talks on different environmental and waste management issues. City Council staff develop and present this information to schoolchildren (and other waste producing sectors in the city). The aim of this information is to encourage practical waste avoidance initiatives within the school (e.g. composting projects). The City Council will continue to co-operate with Non-Governmental Organisations and businesses with respect to co-funding these initiatives.\n4.4.2 The Green Flag Scheme for Schools\nCity schools are currently being encouraged to minimise waste in accordance with an innovative waste audit system modelled on international quality systems such as the International Standards\u2019 Organisation\u2019s ISO 9000 programme. A successful result in the waste audit is recognised and the school is then allowed to display a flag with the recycling logo on it. The waste audit is subsequently repeated every three years. To-date, 12 schools in Cork City have received the Green Flag Award.\nThis programme is jointly undertaken by both Cork City Council and County Council and is another example of the long-standing co-operation between the two local authorities with respect to waste management activities.\n4.4.3 Investment in Relevant Research\nCork City Council has forged strong links with a number of third-level educational institutions around the region \u2013 for example University College Cork, the Clean Technology Centre and the Cork Institute of Technology. The advice and research findings obtained from these co-operative efforts are subsequently incorporated into the Public Awareness programmes undertaken by the City Council. It is likely that local authorities will enter into more and more of such co-operative efforts in the future as their role changes from a waste disposal-dominated one to a more advisory/ enforcement function.\n4.4.4 The Green F\u00e1ilte Programme\nCork City Council and County Council have co-operated in the development of an environmental improvement programme aimed specifically at the hotel sector. The programme includes:\nSelf-assessment questionnaires with built-in scoring systems;\nIdentification of suitable improvement targets in-line with baseline performance;\nProvision of Information Packs;\nPublic award ceremonies;\nPrizes for the best waste reduction ideas;\nPublication of reports outlining the types and scale of improvements which are possible \u2013 identifying \u2018model\u2019 hotels to act as incentives for the rest of the sector; and\nThe completion of external audits of the hotels to verify the results of their in-house surveys.\n4.5 Waste Avoidance in City Hall\n4.5.1 Green Housekeeping Committee\nA Green Housekeeping Committee, which meets monthly, has been set up within Cork City Council to address the entire field of sustainable development. One important element of the Committee\u2019s responsibilities is the field of waste management \u2013 including the concepts of waste avoidance. The Committee is now pro-actively involved in all waste management decisions at City Hall.\nThis interdepartmental group advises all other divisions of the local authority as to their responsibilities in relation to waste management, energy usage and the environment generally. Another key function involves advising the purchasing departments of the City Council as to ways of reducing waste packaging and implementing City Council waste management policy. Successful schemes have included the returning of all computer hardware packaging waste to the supplier for recycling, the recycling of waste toner cartridges and office paper and the use of reusable envelopes for internal mail.\n4.5.2 Voluntary Environmental Management System\nIn order to set a good example for the rest of the city, Cork City Council has implemented an Environmental Management System in City Hall. The implementation of such a system is a significant task as it involves the identification of all of the different environmental impacts occurring, and the initiation of measures to avoid those impacts. Waste management is an important element of any Environmental Management System. Cork City Council has received ISO 14001 accreditation for two of its Parks Sections and for the Kinsale Road Landfill Site. Cork City Council will continue its policy of seeking ISO14001 accreditation for more of its activities.\n4.6 Public Awareness Measures\nThe City Council is committed to the principle of public education concerning waste management issues and has, therefore, pursued an intensive and pro-active public information campaign since the launch of the Waste Management Strategy for the Cork Region in 1995. Other organisational procedures that have been put in place by the City Council to promote better waste management include participating in a joint public relations committee with Cork\nCounty Council. It should be noted that the public awareness measures initiated by the City Council will be aimed not only at reducing the quantities of waste produced in the city, but also the harmful nature of that waste. In other words, information will be provided on environmentally friendly alternatives to products that would give rise to harmful or hazardous wastes materials.\nSome of the other activities, which have been initiated by the local authority, are outlined in the following sections.\n4.6.1 Database of Recycled Products\nCork City Council, in co-operation with Cork County Council, has prepared and disseminated a database of recycled products and materials for the use of the residents of the Cork Region. This information, which is based on a database developed by Forbairt , should form the basis of more informed decision-making on the part of the private sector as well as the general public in Cork.\n4.6.2 The Cork Waste Management Strategy News \u00a0\u2013 20/20 Vision\nCork City Council, in co-operation with Cork County Council, publishes a newsletter with widespread appeal for all sectors of the population. This publication provides information on waste management initiatives in the Cork region as well as giving helpful hints and tips for people wishing to minimise their waste production and increase their recycling activities.\n4.6.3 Public Educational Programmes\nThe City Council gives many talks on waste minimisation and litter prevention to schools around the city, as international experience has shown that lifestyle change is more likely when the very young are recruited at an early stage. Green Housekeeping policies are also discussed and explained to local schoolchildren. It should be noted that this service is not just reserved for schools \u2013 rather the City Council will arrange educational events for any group which requests them (for example, national schoolteachers and small- and medium-sized enterprises). The City Council proposes to intensify and publicise these programmes which will be undertaken by the City Council staff.\nThe City Council utilises the available media (namely radio, newsprint and the City Council Website) to ensure that key decisions, policies and developments in the field of waste management are communicated effectively to the general public resident in the city.\n"}, {"score": 857.30005, "uuid": "ed3370b8-d6aa-52d0-b2ba-aef5df4fa934", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1906wb-37-17178", "target_hostname": "myzerowaste.com", "target_uri": "http://myzerowaste.com/articles/zero-waste-week/", "page_rank": 2.9213814e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Zero <em>waste</em> week", "snippet": "Is there much <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> one of these <em>and</em> <em>the</em> compost bins you can put your <em>waste</em> cooked food straight into (apart from <em>the</em> initial price <em>and</em> <em>the</em> inside&#x2F;otside factors).", "explanation": null, "document": "Browse > Home / Articles / Zero waste week\nZero waste week\nAdd article to favourites\nGloucestershire\u2019s zero waste week takes place 26th January 2009 until 1st February.

This amounts to 6.7 million tonnes of food each year.\nAs the food crisis increases around the world, it makes sense for us to reduce the amount of food we waste. This will save us money too - imagine saving a third of your weekly food bill!\nFood waste is caused by cooking too much and then throwing away the extras, buying 3 for 2 offers and not using things before they go off, impulse buys, poor portion control or mouldy fruit and vegetables.\nMany people think that throwing food in the landfill is ok. It\u2019s biodegradable after all, so doesn\u2019t create problems. The trouble is, more often than not, the biodegradable food gets wrapped inside a non biodegradable plastic bag! If the air doesn\u2019t get to the food then it won\u2019t rot down.\nIn the absence of oxygen, biodegradable materials (such as food, cardboard and green waste) decompose and produce methane gas, which contributes to global warming.\nHere are my top ten tips to help you reduce food waste.\nMenu plan.\nThink about the meals that your family enjoys most and make a menu plan for the week. Write down the ingredients you need for each meal on a list. There is nothing worse than pushing a trolley around a supermarket aimlessly with no ideas about your meals for the following week. You often end up with an expensive trolley full of ingredients that don\u2019t go together!\nUse up your leftovers.\nBefore you begin your menu plan, take a look at any leftovers in the fridge, vegetable rack and cupboards. Vegetables which are starting to go soft can be made into soup or pasta sauces. Over ripe fruits can be made into pies or blended to make smoothies. Half a tin of tuna could be tonight\u2019s pasta bake and a few spoons of cooked mince could be made into pasties.\nWrite a shopping list.\nWrite a list from your menu plan and take it with you to the shop. If you stick to the list you\u2019ll be more likely to resist impulse buys that don\u2019t get used up.\nDon\u2019t shop when you\u2019re hungry.\nIt\u2019s a simple tip but an important one. If you shop when your stomach is growling, you\u2019ll be tempted to buy all sorts of things you don\u2019t need. Plus if you\u2019re focusing on your hunger, you\u2019re not focusing on making good choices.\nRotate foods in your cupboards and fridge.\nWhen you get home from shopping, put all the new food at the BACk of the fridge and cupboards and bring last week\u2019s old items to the front. How many times have you found something mouldy hiding in the back of the \u2018fridge?\nTake a look at what you throw away.\nBe honest with yourself and start writing things down. Do you throw away half a loaf of bread a week? Then why not freeze it and take out slices as you need them. Take individual slices out for sandwiches the night before you need them, or use straight from frozen for toasting. If you regularly throw away vegetables then maybe you need to buy them loose and reduce the amount you buy each week.\nCheck your fridge.\nAre the seals good and is the temperature set to between 1 and 5 degrees? This ensures your fridge will keep your food fresh for as long as possible.\nStart a compost heap, a wormery or a bokashi bin.\nIf you regularly throw out gone off fruit and vegetables then why not turn them into something useful by starting a compost bin. They are easier than you might think to manage and there are a range of styles to suit all garden sizes.\nCheck out Recycle Now first to see if your council has a special deal on compost bins.\nIf you have a tiny garden, then you could try a wormery .\nIf you have no garden at all then why not try a kitchen composter , such as the Bokashi bin? A bokashi bin will even take cooked food scraps. Keep checking back on the site for an exciting competition to win a bokashi bin in the future!\nPortion control.\nIt can be difficult, especially with children who eat like a horse one day and hardly anything the next, to serve the right sized portions. Why not let your family help themselves by taking a small portion with the knowledge that they can come back for more when that has been eaten? Any leftovers can be covered and stored in the \u2018fridge once they have cooled down and used the following day.\nLeft overs and ingredients.\nView today\u2019s leftovers as tomorrow\u2019s ingredients with a bit of creative thinking. A couple of sausages could be made into a pasta bake or toad in the hole, cooked vegetables can be made into bubble and squeak, a bit of pasta can be tossed with vegetables and some chickpeas for a pasta salad, a couple of rashers of bacon can be made into an omlette. The possibilities are endless; all you need to do is add imagination.\nThere is a great website that deals with this issue. The Love Food Hate Waste campaign aims to raise awareness of the need to reduce the amount of food that we throw away, and how doing this will benefit us as consumers and the environment.\nOn the site you will find plenty of recipes, facts about storing food and even suggestions about portion control.\nWhat about you - what is the best recipe you\u2019ve made from leftovers? Do you have a top tip to help reduce food waste?\nPlease share it with us in the comments below!\nReferences links for this article\n"}, {"score": 852.03485, "uuid": "73500631-6416-520f-9fcb-984e907c73f7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1108wb-07-03253", "target_hostname": "www.sswm.info", "target_uri": "http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/wastewater-treatment/hardware/semi-centralised-wastewater-treatments/w", "page_rank": 1.276401e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "<em>Waste</em> Stabilisation Ponds | SSWM", "snippet": "There is little evidence for nitrification <em>and</em> denitrification.

PDF\nStabilization ponds are a very promising sustainable centralized wastewater treatment option for West Africa due to the favourable climate. Pilot studies could demonstrate their performance in the local context; however none of the full-scale applications works. Besides the poor economic situation and little political support, it is also the lack of training and research that contributes to this situation. This work presents the establishment of an international research collaboration network and main technical recommendations based on an exhaustive assessment on the state-of-the-art of stabilization ponds in the West-African context.\nLanguage: French\nROSE, D.G. ; IDRC (Editor) (1997): Community-Based Technologies for Domestic Wastewater Treatment and Reuse- options for urban agriculture .

Thus further use of franchising and contractingout of services should be considered. However, in administering these policies a potential conflict of interest may arise as the local authority is not only a provider of such services but also the purchaser. Mechanisms can be put in place whereby the public operations are separated from the local authority so as to create a level playing field between public and private bidders for any tender.\u201d\n\u201cThe international review that the \u201cissue of costs cannot be completely divorced from the matter of configuration of the waste collection market\u201d (Eunomia et al., 2009, p. 20). The current system for household waste collection is characterised by the public and private sector operators competing on the same route. Such arrangements are unusual by international standards, where either the local authority provides the service or it is tendered for a 5 to 7 year period. The international review could only identify Poland and Kosovo within Europe as having household waste collection arrangements similar to Ireland.\u201d\n\u201cThere are good reasons why there should be only one supplier of household waste collection in any geographic area; in particular the ability to realise economies of scale, scope and density. Since it is generally recognised that there are these economies the issue becomes how to select the firm \u2013 public or private or some combination of the two \u2013 that should be given responsibility for collecting waste. The normal mechanism is a tender process when the tender guarantees the winner the exclusive right to collect household waste over a number of years for a defined set of households. Part of the bid is a schedule of collection charges, with the lower the level the greater the probability that the firm will win the tender. In other words we have competition for the market, rather than competition in the market. Under these arrangements, if the public sector provider is the incumbent, then it will like any private sector firm have to bid for the tender. To avoid possible conflicts of interest the public sector operator can be turned into a quasifirm, sometimes referred to as a direct labour organisation, and compete with private sector operators. It would also be necessary to ensure that local authorities were treated no more favourably than the private sector with respect to the application of VAT.\u201d\n\u201cIf the efficiency savings that the international review are seeking are to be realised then the overwhelming message from the literature cited by the international review is that a tendering process is required in order to award the right to collect household waste, with any incumbent public (or private) sector operator given no advantage.\u201d\nOliver Vandt\n"}, {"score": 825.405, "uuid": "454d7088-78fe-5bd4-882e-b62956123807", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0406wb-94-24672", "target_hostname": "wgbis.ces.iisc.ernet.in", "target_uri": "http://wgbis.ces.iisc.ernet.in/biodiversity/pubs/ces_tr/TR118_SPoonancha/Index.htm", "page_rank": 1.1736311e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Environmental Audit of Municipal Solid <em>Waste</em> Management", "snippet": "with <em>biodegradable</em> <em>and</em> <em>non</em>-<em>biodegradable</em> <em>waste</em> streams.", "explanation": null, "document": "Environmental Audit of Municipal Solid Waste Management\nTECHNICAL REPORT: 118 June 2006\nBack T.

Field survey was carried out in seven wards (representative samples of the city) to understand the practice and the lacuna.\u00a0 The audit was carried out functional element wise in selected wards to understand the efficacy and shortfalls, if any, of MSWM. 49% of the bins are covered while evaluating storage options.\u00a0\u00a0 17.5% of the commercial areas have community bins and 94% of the residential areas have adopted a door-to-door method for the collection of waste. Segregation of wastes in these methods of collection is 3%. There are no transfer stations presently and large-scale trucks have been used in a few wards to carry out the functions of a transfer station. Among the trucks used for the disposal of wastes from wards to disposal sites, 41.43% are polythene covered. Recycling carried out mainly by the informal sector (rag pickers) has high level of efficiency and the recyclables are being retrieved by this sector at all stages starting from collection to disposal of wastes at dump sites. As the major composition of waste is organic, waste treatment options like composting is successful in Bangalore and currently 3.14% waste reduction is achieved through composting. Ultimately, about 60% of the waste is disposed in dump yards and a balance of 21.14% is disposed in open quarry sites.\nKeywords: solid waste; environmental auditing; functional elements; composting; landfill sites; municipal solid waste management\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n1.1.1Principle Elements of an Environmental Audit\n1.1.2 Goals of an environmental audit\n1.1.3 Types of environmental audits\n1.3 Solid waste management\n1.3.1 Categories of Solid Waste\n1.4 Municipal Solid Waste\n1.4.1 Types of Municipal Solid Waste\n1.4.2 Municipal Solid Waste Management\n1.5 Environmental and Health risk scenarios\n1.2 Legal Framework applicable to Municipal Solid Waste Management\n1.6 Functional Elements of Municipal Solid Waste Management\n1.6.1 Waste Generation\n1.6.2 Waste Handling, Sorting, Storage, and Processing at the source\n1.6.3 Collection\n1.6.4 Sorting, processing and transformation of Solid Waste\n1.6. 6.

Solid wastes arise from human and animal activities that are normally discarded as useless or unwanted. In other words, solid wastes may be defined as the organic and inorganic waste materials produced by various activities of the society and which have lost their value to the first user. As the result of rapid increase in production and consumption, urban society rejects and generates solid material regularly which leads to considerable increase in the volume of waste generated from several sources such as, domestic wastes, commercial wastes, institutional wastes and industrial wastes of most diverse categories. Management of solid waste may be defined as that discipline associated with the control of generation, storage, collection, transfer and transport, processing, and disposal of solid wastes in a manner that is in accord with the best principles of public health, economics, engineering, conservation, aesthetics, and other environmental considerations. In its scope, solid waste management includes all administrative, financial, legal, planning, and engineering functions involved in the whole spectrum of solutions to problems of solid wastes thrust upon the community by its inhabitants (Tchobanaglous, G. et al, 1997). Solid wastes have the potential to pollute all the vital components of living environment (i.e., air, land and water) at local and at global levels. The problem is compounded by trends in consumption and production patterns and by continuing urbanization of the world.\u00a0 The problem is more acute in developing nations than in developed nations as the economic growth as well as urbanization is more rapid.\nThis issue has now received the attention by international and national policy making bodies and citizens.\u00a0 In the international level the awareness regarding waste began in 1992 with the Rio Conference, here waste was made one of the priorities of Agenda 21*.\u00a0 Here specific attention was given to the environmentally sound management of solid wastes.\u00a0 The Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable development in 2002 focused on initiatives to accelerate the shift to sustainable consumption and production, and the reduction of resource degradation, pollution, and waste.\u00a0 The priority was given to waste minimization, recycle, and reuse followed by the safe disposal of waste to minimize pollution.\n( Note : * Agenda 21 is a comprehensive plan of action to be taken globally, nationally and locally and was adopted by more than 178 Governments at the UN Conference in Rio de Janeiro.)\nThe government of India started encouraging proper management of solid waste as early as 1960\u2019s by giving loans for setting composting plants for MSW.\u00a0 The government of India over the years has taken many initiatives and implemented new technologies and methods. With the rapid urbanization, the problem of the MSWM problem has compounded and India is awakening to the magnitude of the problem.\u00a0 Due to increased public awareness of MSWM, a public litigation was filed and resulted in the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000.\u00a0 Government for the first time now has included private organizations in providing this public service.\u00a0 New methods of storage, collection, transportation, processing and disposal are being implemented.\u00a0 It is necessary to evaluate the current process at this stage to understand if the methods being implemented are suitable for the Indian scenario and to identify the lacuna in the methods being adopted.\u00a0 This can be achieved by carrying out an audit.\u00a0 An audit not only brings out the shortcomings in a system, but also raises awareness on the problems addressed.\u00a0 Audit of a waste management system is a way to reduce problems caused by waste by revealing the shortcomings of the management system, the responsible actors and identifying the actors and the areas that need improvement.\u00a0 This endevour aims at evaluating the Indian MSWM scenario through literatures review and a case study of Bangalore city.\n1.1 Environmental Auditing\nEnvironmental Auditing can be defined as a management tool comprising a systematic, well documented, periodic and objective evaluation of how well the management systems are performing with the aim of helping to safeguard the environment by:\nFacilitating management control of environmental practices, and\nAssessing compliance with national legislation, which would include regulatory requirements.\nEnvironmental Auditing first began with the principle of \u2018polluters pay\u2019 to prevent liabilities towards the government.\u00a0 The other important reason could be due to the increasing awareness of the public about environmental protection, the companies voluntarily carried out audits of its operations and processes to prove that their products are environmentally friendly.\nEnvironmental audit was introduced in India for the minimization of generation of wastes and pollution.\u00a0 In this regard a gazette notification was issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests on March 13, 1992 and later amended vide notification GSR 386 (E) on dated April 22 1993. This notification applies to every person carrying on an industry, operation or process requiring consent to operate under Section 25 of the water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 or under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 (14 of 1981), or both, or authorization under the Environmental Protection Act, 1986 (29 of 1986) (Srivastava, A. K. 2003).\u00a0 The notification requires that an Environmental Statement for the financial year ending the 31st March be submitted to the concerned State Pollution Control Board, on or before the 30th September of the same year.\nThe ISO standard is an example of commercial environmental auditing initiative. ISO stands for the International Standards Organization, located in Geneva, Switzerland. ISO is a non-governmental organization established in 1947. The organization mainly functions to develop voluntary technical standards that aim at making the development, manufacture and supply of goods and services more efficient, safe and clean\nOther types of environmental investigations are frequently conducted with audit like methodologies- such as open inventories and operated oriented investigations, into prevention of waste and pollution.\u00a0 These studies should be defined separately to avoid mistakes.\nThus it is useful to distinguish between three types of audit like processes:\nEnvironmental Reviews : These involve an unprejudiced investigation of a company\u2019s environmental interactions, impacts and performances, with the aim of establishing an environmental protection system, including organizational and technical measures in addition to assessment and auditing procedures.\nEnvironmental Audit : This requires a systematic and objective investigation of a company\u2019s environmental activities, management and equipment against a predetermined set of criteria (legislation, standards, company policy and objectives, etc.).\nPollution Prevention Assessments : These involve a systematic, periodic and internal investigation of a company\u2019s process and operations designed to identify and provide information about opportunities to prevent pollution and waste.\nSource (Benjamin Ntim, 1995)\nThere are various types of auditing, but all types of auditing include three groups of people and are divided into three stages.\u00a0 The three groups of people are auditor, auditee and the third party.\u00a0 The auditor is person or group doing the audit, the auditee is the people or things on whom the audit is done and the third party is people who want to know the results of the audit.\u00a0 The three stages are to assess, test and attest.\u00a0 Assess is to evaluate the current process, test is to compare how they ought to be and attest is to certify or testify the results if necessary (Ralf Buckley, 1991).\n1.1.1Principle Elements of an Environmental Audit\nInternal Audit is an audit carried out by the organization to check its own process and progress.\nExternal audit is an audit carried out by one organization of another organization to check its progress.\nMandatory Audit is an audit carried out by an authority to check the compliance of the process with their requirements. For e.g. insurance checks, export, etc.\nVoluntary Audit is an audit carried out voluntarily by an organization or an individual of another organization to improve the process and compliance of the process with the laws.\nSource (Ralf Buckley, 1991)\n1.1.2 Goals of an environmental audit\nEnvironmental audits can be carried out for a number of reasons.\u00a0 These could include any of the following:\nTo verify compliance\nTo review implementation of policies\nTo identify liabilities\nTo identify strengths and weaknesses\nTo assess environmental performance\nTo promote environmental awareness\nA company or individual\u2019s motivation for carrying out an environmental audit will determine the type of audit it chooses to implement.\u00a0\u00a0 Also, a company may want to carry out an environmental audit for one or all of the above reasons.\n1.1.3 Types of environmental audits\nAn overview of different audit types and their use are given below.\u00a0 It should be noted that the divisions are not very sharp between the various types.\u00a0 Objectives and scope are often a combination of several audit types and are usually defined on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0 Many organizations have developed audit programs to fit in their particular need.\nBased on Objectives environmental audit can be categorized as shown in Table 1\nTable 1: Environmental Audit Categories\nEnvironmental Audit Types\nIssues Audit\nCross-boundary Audit\nLiabilities Audit is often conducted as a prelude to gaining insurance cover and as a means of demonstrating the regulatory compliance.\nCompliance Audit is the most common form of environmental audit that is carried out, it is a verification process whereby the facility establishes the extent to which it is complying with the environmental legislation, regulations, emission limits, etc.\nOperational risk liability audit concentrate on the potential frequency and consequence of environmentally damaging activities in the various functions of the process.\u00a0 Compliance with regulation does not necessarily reduce liability due to operational risks.\nAcquisition audits assess the liabilities due to contaminated land and building remediation costs.\nHealth and safety audits normally form part of Health, safety and Environment (HSE) audit and involve assessment of adequacy of personal protective equipments (safety, shoes, goggles, helmets, etc.), emergency preparedness and disaster management plans.\nManagement Audit pays considerable attention to management systems as they are a guide to how effectively and efficiently the operations runs\nA corporate audit is initiated by the main Board of a parent company and is concerned with the organisation structure, roles and responsibilities, policy implementation, awareness and communication.\u00a0 It is carried out as a reassurance to the main Board that their aims and objectives are being implemented throughout the corporate structure.\nManagement systems audit are carried out to check the systems against the policy and standards such as British standard 7750 or ISO 14001.\nPolicy audit is carried out to review and reassess the relevance of the policy in the light of developments (legal, technical, financial) within the organisation and outside.\nIssues audit is carried out to establish environmental management plan and targets.\nActivities audit cover auditing of select technical and management issues.\nEnvironmental site audit examines all aspects of the facilities performance with respect to the environment.\u00a0 It combines most of the elements of other types of environmental assessment and when undertaken in depth involve considerable time and cost.\nThe waste audits are of two types.\u00a0 The first identifies and quantifies waste streams and is a precursor to both waste minimisation programmes.\u00a0 The second type assesses waste management practice and procedures.\nProduct audits cover several aspects of their environmental impacts through design, manufacture, use and disposal.\u00a0 Such audits are pre-requisites for identifying environmentally friendly products for \u201cGreen labelling\u201d.\nCross boundary audits assess activities, which cut across departments or business units.\u00a0 Transport and supply chain are such examples.\nThe audit is not an evaluation of alternatives that will optimize a course of action to solve operating, engineering, scientific, legal, technical, employee, or public relations problems.\u00a0 The objective of an environmental audit is to reveal whether the system is controlling in a way that will yield expected and understandable results.\u00a0 The audit will succeed if it reveals shortcomings as well as satisfactory conditions and identifies the necessary steps to cure the shortcomings and augment the satisfactory conditions.\n1.3 Solid waste management\nManagement of solid waste is associated with the control of generation, storage, collection, transfer and transport, processing, and disposal of solid wastes in a manner that is in accord with the best principles of public health, economics, engineering, conservation, aesthetics, and other environmental considerations.\u00a0 In its scope, it includes all administrative, financial, legal, planning and engineering functions involved in the whole spectrum of solutions to problems of solid wastes thrust upon the community by its inhabitants (Tchobanaglous, et al, 1997).\n1.3.1 Categories of Solid Waste\nSolid waste can be categorized based on source as shown in table 2.\nTable 2 : Solid Waste categories based on source\nSource\nTypical facilities, activities, or locations where wastes are generated\nTypes of Solid waste\nField and row crops, orchards, vineyards, diaries, feedlots, farms, etc\nSpoiled food wastes, agricultural wastes, rubbish, and hazardous wastes\nIndustrial\nConstruction, fabrication, light and heavy manufacturing, refineries, chemical plants, power plants, demolition, etc.\nIndustrial process wastes, scrap materials, etc.; nonindustrial waste including food waste, rubbish, ashes, demolition and construction wastes, special wastes, and hazardous waste.\nCommercial and Institutional\nStores, restaurants, markets, office buildings, hotels, auto repair shops,\nPaper, cardboard, plastics, wood, food wastes, glass, metal wastes, ashes, special wastes, etc.\nMunicipal solid waste\nIncludes residential, commercial and institutions\nSpecial waste, rubbish, general waste, paper, plastics, metals, food waste, etc.\nSource : (Hester, R. E and Harrison, R. M., 2002)\n1.4 Municipal Solid Waste\nThe term municipal solid waste (MSW) is normally assumed to include all of the waste generated in a community, with the exception of waste generated by municipal services, treatment plants, and industrial and agricultural processes (Tchnobanoglous, G and Kreith, F., 2002).\u00a0 In the urban context the term municipal solid wastes is of special importance.\u00a0 The term refers to all wastes collected and controlled by the municipality and comprises of most diverse categories of wastes.\u00a0 It comprises of wastes from several different sources such as, domestic wastes, commercial wastes, institutional wastes and building materials wastes.\n1.4.1 Types of Municipal Solid Waste\nTable 3: The sources of municipal solid waste\nSources\nSingle family homes, duplexes, town houses, apartments\nCommercial\nOffice buildings, shopping malls, warehouses, hotels, airports, restaurants\nInstitutional\nPackaging of components, office wastes, lunchroom and restroom wastes (but not industrial process wastes)\nSource : (Tchobanoglous, G and Kreith, F., 2002)\n1.4.2 Municipal Solid Waste Management\nMunicipal Solid waste management involves the application of principle of Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) to municipal waste. ISWM is the application of suitable techniques, technologies and management programs covering all types of solid wastes from all sources to achieve the twin objectives of (a) waste reduction and (b) effective management of waste still produced after waste reduction.\nIn the Municipal Solid Waste Management the major issues to be considered are:\nIncreasing waste quantities\nWastes not reported in the national MSW totals\nLack of clear definition for solid waste management terms and functions\nLack of quality data\nNeed for clear roles in state and local government\nNeed for even and predictable enforcement regulations and standards\n1.5 Environmental and Health risk scenarios\nPotential hazards of solid wastes are numerous to the living community when it is improperly managed. Solid wastes have the potential to pollute all the vital components of living environment (i.e., air, land and water). Some of the hazards caused by solid wastes are listed below;\nUncollected wastes often end up in drains, causing blockages that result in flooding and unsanitary conditions.\nOpen and overflowing bins attract stray dogs, which has been a major cause of the spread of rabies.\nOpen waste bins also attract stray and domestic cattle.\u00a0 Cattle in the city causes nuisance by blocking the traffic on the roads.\u00a0 Cattle that graze on the waste from bins end up eating the plastic along with the vegetable matter, which proves to be fatal for them.\u00a0 The milk obtained from the cattle that feed on waste can be contaminated and can prove to be unsafe for human health.\nFlies breed in some constituents of solid wastes, and flies are very effective vectors that spread disease.\nMosquitoes breed in blocked drains and in rainwater that is retained in discarded cans, tire and other objects. Mosquitoes spread disease, including malaria and dengue.\nRats find shelter and food in waste dumps. Rats consume and spoil food, spread disease, damage electrical cables and other materials and inflict unpleasant bites.\nThe open burning of waste causes air pollution; the products of combustion include dioxins that are particularly hazardous.\nAerosols and dusts can spread fungi and pathogens from uncollected and decomposing wastes.\nUncollected waste degrades the urban environment, discouraging efforts to keep streets and open spaces in a clean and hygienic condition. Plastic bags are in particular an aesthetic nuisance.\nWaste collection workers face particular occupational hazards, including strains from lifting, injuries from sharp objects and contact with pathogens when manually handling the waste.\nDangerous items (such as broken glass, razor blades, hypodermic needles and other healthcare wastes, aerosol cans and potentially explosive containers and chemicals from industries) may pose risks of injury or poisoning, particularly to children and people who sort through the waste.\nHeavy refuse collection trucks can cause significant damage to the surfaces of roads that were not designed for such weights.\nWaste items that are reused without being cleaned effectively or sterilized can transmit infection to later users. (Examples are bottles and medical supplies.)\nPolluted water (leachate) flowing from waste dumps and disposal sites can cause serious pollution of water supplies, ponds and lakes. Chemical wastes (especially persistent organics) may be fatal or have serious effects if ingested, inhaled or touched and can cause widespread pollution of water supplies.\nWaste that is treated or disposed of in unsatisfactory ways can cause a severe aesthetic nuisance in terms of smell and appearance.\nLiquids and fumes, escaping from deposits of wastes (perhaps formed as a result of chemical reactions between components in the wastes), can have fatal or other serious effects.\nMethane (one of the main components of landfill gas) is much more effective than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, leading to climate change.\nFires on disposal sites can cause major air pollution, causing illness and reducing visibility, making disposal sites dangerously unstable, causing explosions of cans, and possibly spreading to adjacent property.\nFormer disposal sites provide very poor foundation support for large buildings, so buildings constructed on former sites are prone to collapse.\nRag pickers working on landfill are prone to many diseases like respiratory infections such as lung impairment.\u00a0 In a study carried out by Chittaranjan national Cancer Institute, Kolkata compared the health of Delhi\u2019s rag pickers with that of the control subjects from east Delhi slums.\u00a0 Nearly 75.5 rag pickers from the sample group of 98 had higher frequency of upper respiratory symptoms (sinusitis, running or stuffy nose, sore throat, common cold, fever) and 81.6 per cent showed lower respiratory symptoms (dry cough, cough with phlegm, wheezing, and chest discomfort) and breathing problem.\nNumerous technologies / options are available in SWM, among developed countries. Replicating the same in low-income countries is inappropriate / incompatible. The success of waste disposal practices depends largely on overcoming the following constraints,\nMUNICIPAL CAPACITY : The scale of task is enormous and regulatory authorities are able to collect only 60-70% of total waste generated, so treatment and disposal inevitably receives less attention. Attempts are being made in a few instances to overcome this lack of capacity by privatizing this operation.\nPOLITICAL COMMITMENTS : Solid waste management is much more than a technical issues; it has implications for local taxation, employment, and regulation of public and managing authorities. Any change needs political support to be effective. However, it is rarely a priority for political concerns unless there is strong and active public interest. This is viewed as a cost to the \"public\" without apparent returns.\nFINANCE, COST RECOVERY AND RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS : Deployment of a proper management system represents a major investment and it may be difficult to give it priority over other resource demands. Most of the waste management authorities are severely constrained by the lack of resource to finance their services. Since the collection and transport itself usually dominate SWM costs in developing countries, safe disposal invariably receives less attention where as in all other developed countries concentrate on all aspects of management.\nTECHNICAL GUIDELINES : Standards of planning and implementation in high-income countries may not be appropriate in low-income countries due to difference in climate, resource, institutions, attitude priorities, etc. However, relatively little appropriate guidance is available for low-income countries. Arising from this uncertainty, officials find themselves ill equipped to plan management strategies, which are both achievable and avoid unacceptable environmental hazards.\nINSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES : Though managing wastes effectively is the responsibility of the municipality, there is no clearly stated vision of management (i.e. sufficient priority is not given to SWM). Existing vision is accompanied by a typical apathy to solid waste is an \"out of sight is out of mind\" attitude by the municipalities and public because of strict rule and regulations are not implemented just like as in prevention of emission of water and air pollutants. Waste management necessities the co-ordination of all authorities concerned and may involve departments that are accustomed to acting independently but the lack of accountability in all levels of management. Among the authorities, the roles and responsibilities of different departments need to be clearly defined and accepted by all concerned. Some smaller towns may not have staff with specific responsibility for providing a solid waste management service.\nINADEQUATE LEGAL PROVISIONS : In most countries, the laws and regulations on solid waste management are outmoded and fragmented and hence are inadequate to deal effectively with the modern complications of managing wastes in large cities. Most of the laws deal with the general tidiness of the city streets, waste collection and their disposal at places away from settlements. Even these inadequate laws are not fully enforced. This aggravates the situation further.\n1.2 Legal Framework applicable to Municipal Solid Waste Management\nLegislation concerning waste is usually differentiated according to the type of waste.\u00a0 International conventions often cover nuclear and hazardous waste, whereas non hazardous waste, often called solid waste is usually more regulated at the national level.\u00a0 From an environmental angle the following environmental rules, regulations and acts would be the most relevant for MSWM:\nMunicipal Solid Waste (Management & Handling) Rules 2000, notified by the ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India vide notification No. S.O.908 (E) dated 25th September 2000.\u00a0 The guidelines given in this law covers all the functional elements of municipal solid waste management.\nThe Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.\u00a0 Two aspects have to be kept in mind of this law in regard to MSWM.\u00a0 Firstly, a consent from the state pollution control board for establishment of a sanitary landfill site and compost plant is essential and secondly, no water pollution should be caused by the leachate that is emitted by the sanitary landfill site or a compost plant.\nThe Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 and amendments thereon.\u00a0 The only aspect that should be considered in this law in regard to MSWM is provision for levying and collection of cess on water consumed for the sanitary landfilling, composting and anaerobic digesters.\nThe Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and amendments thereon.\u00a0 The aspects to be considered in this law with respect to MSWM is the need for obtaining consent from the State Pollution Control Board for establishment of the processing plants and disposal site and from an environmental aspect would be the pollution caused by incineration plants, compost plants and landfill sites.\nThe Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986 and its subsequent notifications.\u00a0 The aspect in regard to MSWM would be the EIA notification, 1944, which states that for any project to be authorized an EIA report should be submitted first.\n1.6 Functional Elements of Municipal Solid Waste Management\nTo implement proper waste management, various aspects have to be considered such as Waste generation (source reduction), Waste handling and sorting, storage and processing at the source (onsite storage), Collection, Sorting, processing and transformation, ransfer and transport, and Disposal \u00a0(The Expert Committee, 2000). Figure 1, shows the interrelationship between the functional elements in solid waste management.\nFigure 1: The Municipal Solid Waste Stream\n1.6.1 Waste Generation\nWaste generation encompasses activities in which materials are identified as no longer being of value (in their present form) and are either thrown away or gathered together for disposal.\u00a0 Waste generation at present is not very controllable.\u00a0 However, reduction of waste at source is included in system evaluations as a method of limiting the quantity of waste generated.\nThe compositional terms that are used can vary a lot, from relatively simple descriptions in terms of organic to more complicated schemes, using many or all of the constituents, such as paper, plastic, glass, metal etc.\nThe composition of the waste is a description of the contents of the waste.\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to providing important information about the way to handle the waste, the composition tells us about the people who generated the waste.\u00a0 The composition of waste varies widely from place to place, especially country to country.\nTable4: Relative composition of household waste in low, medium and high-income countries\nParameter\n1500 to 2700\nSource : (INTOSAI working group on environmental auditing, 2002)\nTo illustrate the information that can be deduced from information on composition, we can start with table 4 that shows the average composition and amounts of waste for low, medium and high-income countries.\nThe most striking difference that can be seen is the difference in organic content which is much higher in the low income countries than the high income countries and the paper and plastic content which is much higher in higher income countries than low income countries.\u00a0 This shows the difference in consumption pattern, cultural and educational differences\nIn higher income countries the usage of disposable material, magazines and packaged food is used in higher quantity that results in a waste having higher calorific value, lower specific density, and lower moisture content.\u00a0 In case of lower income countries the usage of fresh vegetables to packaged food is much higher and mostly materials that are reusable are used.\u00a0 This results in a waste composition that has high moisture content, high specific weight and low calorific value.\u00a0 This shows how waste statistics can be used to describe the life style of the people and also their income.\n1.6.2 Waste Handling, Sorting, Storage, and Processing at the source\nWaste handling and sorting involves activities associated with management of wastes until they are placed in storage containers for collection.\u00a0 Handling also encompasses the movement of loaded containers to the point of collection.\nSorting is an important component of waste management and best-done onsite.\u00a0 However, there are various stages of sorting.\u00a0 These can be identified as the following:\nAt the source or house hold level\nAt the community bin (municipal bin)\nAt transfer station or centralised sorting facility\nAt waste processing site (pre-sorting and post sorting)\nAt the landfill site\nSorting Operations can be carried out in three ways:\nManual sorting\nSemi-mechanised sorting\nFully mechanised sorting\nOnsite storage is of primary importance because of public health concerns.\u00a0 Open ground storage, make shift containers should always be avoided and only closed containers should be used.\u00a0 Processing at the source involves backyard composting.\u00a0 Storage of wastes can be done at three levels:\nAt source\nAt transfer stations\n1.6.3 Collection\nThis includes gathering the solid wastes and recyclable materials and transport of these materials to either the processing facility, transfer facility or the disposal site.\nTypes of Collection\nCommunity bins - they are placed in convenient locations, where the community members carry the waste and throw it in.\u00a0 This method is comparatively cheaper to other methods.\u00a0 This is the most widely adopted method in western countries.\u00a0 For this method to be adopted it is important that the Bins are covered, they are aesthetic, they are attended to regularly, kept clean, easy to handle and separate bins are provided for recyclable, mixed, paper and biodegradable waste.\nDoor-to-Door collection \u2013 The waste is placed at the doorstep at a set time when the waste collector arrives.\u00a0 In this method, it is the collector of the waste has the responsibility to collect the waste separately.\u00a0 This method is very convenient for the householder, however requires homeowner cooperation and scheduled service for homeowner cooperation.\nBlock collection - the collection vehicles arrive at a particular place or a set day and time to collect waste from the households.\u00a0 Households bring their waste containers and empty directly into the vehicle.\u00a0 This method requires a higher homeowner cooperation and scheduled service for homeowner cooperation.\nCurbside collection \u2013 the homeowner is responsible for placing the containers to be emptied at the curb on the collection day and for returning the empty containers to their storage location until the next collection (Tchobanolous, G et al 1993)\nStreet cleansing is another type of collection method mainly for collection of street litter.\n1.6.4 Sorting, processing and transformation of Solid Waste\nThis functional unit encompasses the recovery of the sorted materials, processing of solid waste and transformation of solid waste that occurs primarily in locations away from the source of waste generation.\nSorting of the mixed waste usually occurs at a material recovery facility, transfer stations, combustion facilities and disposal sites.\u00a0 Sorting includes separation of bulky items, separation of waste components by size using screens, manual separation of waste components, and separation of ferrous and non-ferrous metals.\nWaste processing and transformation Solid waste processing reduces the amount of material requiring disposal and, in some cases produces a useful product.\u00a0 Examples of solid waste processing technologies include material recovery facilities, where recyclable materials are removed and/or sorted; composting facilities where organics in solid waste undergo controlled decomposition; and waste-to-energy facilities where waste becomes energy for electricity.\nLandfilling continues to be required even if solid waste processing technologies are employed because all of these technologies produce some sort of residue or handle only a portion of the waste stream. For example, landfilling is still required for ash and bypass Waste (waste that can\u2019t be burned) from waste-to energy facilities. Thus, solid waste processing technologies do not replace landfilling; rather they are a part of an integrated system that reduces the amount of material that requires landfill disposal.\nThe different types of processing techniques are given below\nRecycling and reuse - the process, by which materials otherwise destined for disposal are collected, reprocessed or remanufactured and are reused.\u00a0 The recycling and reuse (the use of a product more than once in its same form for the same or other purpose) sector of waste management in cities of Asian developing countries is potentially high. Its economic assessment is a difficult task since it is practised in an informal way.\nComposting is a biological process of decomposition carried out under controlled conditions of ventilation, temperature, moisture and organisms in the waste themselves that convert waste into humus-like material by acting on the organic portion of the solid waste (Sathishkumar, et al 2002). It produces a sludge, which is high in nutrients and can be used as a fertilizer.\u00a0 This is one element of an integrated solid waste management strategy that can be applied to mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) or to separately collected leaves, yard waste or food waste.\u00a0 There are various methods of composting, which are:\nBangalore method - This is an anaerobic method conventionally carried out in pits.\u00a0 The waste and the soil is alternatively laid out in layers and then is covered with a solid layer to prevent flies, odour and water seepage.\u00a0 This material is allowed to decompose for 4 to 6 months after which the stabilised material is taken out and used as compost.\nIndore method - this method is similar to Bangalore method, however to ensure aerobic condition the material is turned at specific intervals. First turn is given manually after 4-7 days. 2nd turn is given after 5-10 days and further turning is normally not required and the compost is ready in 2 to 4 weeks.\nWindrow composting : is a common method of composting, it involves the stabilization of organic solid waste through aerobic degradation.\u00a0 The waste is piled in heaps with approximately a height of 3 m, width of 1.5 m and varying lengths.\u00a0 The waste is left for 60 days for decomposition with weekly turnings to aerate the heaps.\u00a0 After which, it can be sieved and the compost is obtained.\nVermicomposting : is a comparatively new method in composting, it involves the stabilisation of organic solid waste through earthworm consumption that converts the material into earthworm castings.\u00a0 Vermicomposting is the result of combined activity of microorganisms and earthworms.\nEnergy recovery Processes\nThe main Parameters, which determine the potential of recovery of energy from wastes (including MSW), are:\nQuantity of waste, and\nPhysical and chemical characteristics (quality) of the waste\nThe important physical parameters requiring consideration include:\nSize of constituents\nDensity\nMoisture content\nSmaller size aids in faster decomposition of the waste.\u00a0 Waste of high density reflects a high proportion of biodegradable organic matter and moisture.\u00a0 Low-density wastes, on the other hand, indicate a high proportion of paper, plastic and other combustibles.\nHigh moisture content causes biodegradable waste fraction to decompose more rapidly than in dry conditions.\u00a0 It also makes the waste rather unsuitable for thermo-chemical conversion (incineration, pyrolysis / gasification) for energy recovery, as heat must first be supplied to remove moisture.\nBio-chemical conversion : This process is based on the enzymatic decomposition of organic matter by microbial action to produce methane gas or alcohol.\u00a0 It is preferred for wastes having high percentage of organic biodegradable (putriscible) matter and high level of moisture/water content, which aids microbial activity.\nBiogasification - also called biomethanisation is the process of decomposing biomass with anaerobic bacteria to produce biogas. This process produces Biogas containing approximately 60:40 mixtures of methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) and simultaneously generating an enriched sludge fertilizer- with an energy content of 22.5 MJ/m3.\u00a0 In Anaerobic digestion (AD) the organic fraction of municipal solid waste offers the advantage of both a net energy gain by producing methane as well as the production of a fertilizer from the residuals (Edelmann, W et al 2000).\nLandfill gas recovery : The waste deposited in a landfill gets subjected, over a period of time to anaerobic conditions and its organic fraction gets slowly volatilised and decomposed.\u00a0 This leads to production of landfill gas containing about 45-55% methane, which can be recovered through a network of gas collection pipes and utilised as a source of energy.\nThermochemical conversion :\nIncineration - is one of the most effective means of dealing with many wastes, which reduces their harmful potential, and often to convert them to energy form (Tchobanoglous, et al 2002). Incineration is the controlled burning of waste in a purpose built facility.\u00a0 It involves the process of direct burning of wastes in the presence of excess air at the temperatures of about 800\u00b0C and above (The Expert Committee, 2000).\u00a0 The process sterilizes and stabilises the waste.\u00a0 For most wastes, it will reduce its volume to less than a quarter of the original.\u00a0 Most of the combustible material is converted into ash and carbon dioxide (Sathishkumar, et al 2002). In practise, about 65-80 % of the energy content of the organic matter can be recovered as heat energy, which can be utilised either for direct thermal applications, or for producing power.\nPyrolysis : is also referred to as destructive distillation or carbonisation.\u00a0 It is the thermal decomposition of organic matter at high temperature (about 900\u00b0C) in an inert (oxygen deficient) atmosphere or vacuum, producing a pyroligenous liquid having high heat value and is a feasible substitute of industrial fuel oil.\nGasification : involves thermal decomposition of organic matter at high temperatures in presence of limited amounts of air/oxygen, producing mainly a mixture of combustible and non-combustible gas (carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide).\u00a0 This process is similar to Pyrolysis, involving some secondary /different high temperature (> 1000\u00b0C) chemistry which improves the heating value of gaseous output and increases the gaseous yield (mainly combustible gases CO+H2) and lesser quantity of other residues.\nDepending\u00a0\u00a0 on the physical and chemical characteristics of the waste the treatment process can be chosen.\u00a0 In table 5 the desirable range of important waste parameters for each process is given.\nTable 5: Desirable range of important waste parameters for technical viability of energy recovery\nWaste treatment method\nDecomposition of organic matter by action of heat\nMoisture content\nCalorific value (Net calorific value)\n> 1200k-cal/kg\nDecomposition of organic matter by microbial action\nMoisture content\nSource : (The Expert Committee, 2000)\n1.6.5. Transfer and transport\nThis involves two steps :\nThe transfer of wastes from smaller collection vehicle to larger transport vehicle and, the subsequent transport of the wastes usually over long distances, to a processing or disposal site.\u00a0 The transfer usually takes place at a transfer station.\n1.6. 6. Disposal\nNon-engineered disposal : This is the most common method of disposal in low-income countries, which have no control, or with only slight or moderate controls.\u00a0 They tend to remain for longer time and environmental degradation could be high, include mosquito, rodent and water pollution, and degradation of the land.\nSanitary Landfill - is a fully engineered disposal option, which avoids harmful effects of uncontrolled dumping by spreading, compacting and covering the wasteland that has been carefully engineered before use.\u00a0 The four minimum requirements for setting up a sanitary landfill are full or partial hydrological isolation, formal engineering preparation, permanent control and planned waste placement and covering.\u00a0 Land filling relies on containment rather than treatment (for control) of wastes.\u00a0 Appropriate liners for protection of the groundwater, leachate collection and treatment, monitoring wells and appropriate final cover design are integral components of an environmentally sound sanitary landfill\n1.7 Municipal Solid Waste Management systems in India\nThe Stakeholders involved in the management of MSWM are :\nThe Ministry of Environment and Forests : The Ministry of Environment and Forests is responsible for general aspects related to waste management, and draws up, coordinates the environmental policy and overseas the implementation of the federal legislation regarding waste management.\nCentral Pollution Control Board : Coordinate the activities of the State Pollution Control Boards and provide technical assistance and training to the personnel.\u00a0 Disseminate information sponsor research relating to waste management.\u00a0 To perform functions prescribed by the Government.\nState Pollution Control Board : Plans a comprehensive program for the prevention, control or abatement of air pollution and water pollution.\u00a0 To inspect, at all reasonable times, any control equipment or process.\u00a0 Prior to installation of a landfill or incinerator, permission from SPCB must be obtained.\nCity Corporation : City Corporation issues permits and creates policy for waste management.\u00a0 Provides waste management services or operates disposal, recycling, or composting facilities.\u00a0 Often contracts out services to the private sector.\nPrivate Formal Sector : Private Formal Sector- participates in performing the functions of collection and transportation of the waste and may operate disposal, transfer, and recycling facilities\nPrivate Informal Sector : Private Informal Sector \u2013 collection of the recyclable waste, transfer to the recycling facility and recycling of waste\nDonor Agency : Donor Agency- helps in sponsoring of innovative projects and projects in low-income areas.\nService Users - the people who use the service of municipal waste management\nThe municipal waste management system involving the stakeholders and the relationship between these stakeholders has been represented in Figure2.\nFigure 2: Municipal Solid Waste Management System in India\n2. STUDY GOALS\nThe improvement of solid waste management is one of the greatest challenges faced by the Indian Government.\u00a0 The Government and the local municipal authorities have taken many initiatives towards the improvement of the current situation.\u00a0 The private sector has been included in the management of the municipal solid waste recently.\u00a0 To understand the level of success in these initiatives, it is necessary to carry out an audit.\u00a0 An audit will identify and bring out the lacuna and the loopholes in the current system in regard to various environmental management aspects like the compliance with environmental regulations, occupational health, resource management, pollution prevention systems and occupational health and safety.\u00a0 This could be one of the best ways to increase awareness about the most suitable approaches to municipal solid waste management, the issues likely to be faced and the alternative measures that can be adopted considering the local scenario.\nThis work provides a case study on an audit of the municipal solid waste management in Bangalore city, to disseminate the innovative practices that have been adopted in the municipal solid waste management program.\u00a0\u00a0 The study will explore the role of various stake holders in MSWM, the current practices, the role of each entity, the shortcomings of the current practices and issues to be addressed to improve the condition.\n2.1 Objective\nAuditing of Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) involved the following objectives\nTo review the existing municipal solid waste management practices\nTo audit the municipal solid waste management practices considering a case of Bangalore city.\n2.2 Relevance\nRegarding solid waste management in particular, there has been improvement in the interest, research and expertise in integrated approaches in developing countries; however, there is a lack of information about local initiatives (Furedy 1997).\u00a0 There is a need for information to be shared, systems to be evaluated, and difficulties to be discussed (Furedy 1997). This study addresses several research needs by providing a case study that has been evaluated in comparison with environmental management concepts, thereby helping to increase general understanding of solid waste management in India. The case study of audit of the management system reflects the system\u2019s specific history, context and conditions, the sharing of experiences and lessons learned which may be of use to others to increase understanding of solid waste management in developing countries, and inspire the development of ideas and actions.\n3. Literature Review\nDeveloped countries have provided technical assistance in SWM to developing countries focusing SWM as a technical problem with an assumption that solid waste problem can be solved with\u00a0 machineries (Lardinois, et al 1997). The \u201cblind technology transfer\u201d of machinery from developed countries to developing countries and subsequent failure has brought attention to the need for appropriate technology (Beukering, et al, 1999) to suite the conditions in developing countries (type of waste, composition, treatment, etc.).\nTable 6: Difference between Developed and developing nations affecting the waste management plan\nConcern\nProtection of entry of toxic and hazardous waste\nEconomics of operation\nNeed to provide a sanitary landfill sites for waste\nNatural setting\nHigh percentage of paper, plastics and cans\nHigh percentage of organic waste, variation of moisture content (seasonal) and combustible\nTechnology choice\nEnvironmental safe alternative, development- oriented decision\nLow cost alternatives complying to regulations\nCitizens and Government Interface\nYears of learning from experience, high educational level of citizens\nLack of experienced and trained personnel, low level of environmental awareness and civic pride\nEmphasis of urban planning and design\nAmenity\nMakeshift measures, response to complaints\nModified from Fernandez, 1997\nIndia has had its own set of experiences by adopting methods and using technologies from developed nations.\u00a0 The management of MSW in developing countries like India has to be looked at from a different perspective.\u00a0 The tried and tested methods adopted in developed countries cannot be blindly implemented.\u00a0\u00a0 This section documents SWM with reference to India, methods and technologies adopted for each functional element.\n3.1 Municipal Solid Waste Management in India\nIn India, according to the Ministry of Environment and Forests \"municipal solid waste\" includes commercial and residential wastes generated in municipal or notified areas in either solid or semi-solid form excluding industrial hazardous wastes but including treated bio-medical wastes (MoEF, 2000).\u00a0 In simple words the municipal solid waste can be defined as the waste that is controlled and collected by local authority and municipality.\nMunicipal Solid Waste Management in India falls under the public health and sanitation and hence as per the Indian Constitution is a State responsibility.\u00a0 This service has always been within the public domain until very recently, that the waste management services started being privatised. The activity being local in nature has been given to local municipal authorities that provide this service with its own staff, equipment and funds.\nThe Government of India (GoI) has encouraged the proper management of MSW from as early as 1960s when the Ministry of Food and Agriculture gave soft loans to the local municipal authorities for MSWM.\u00a0 GoI also gave grants and loans to state government for setting up MSW composting facilities under the fourth five-year plan (1969-74)(Beukering, 1999).\u00a0 In 1974 GoI modified this scheme making it specific only for cities having a population above 30 lakhs.\u00a0 The Water (prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1974 resulted in the creation of Central and State Pollution Control Boards (CPCB and SPCB) with the aim of prevention, abatement and control of water pollution.\u00a0 The Air (Control and Prevention of Pollution) Act of 1981 also empowered the CPCB and SPCB (Harashima, 2000).\u00a0 These Boards now authorise process plants and sanitary landfill sites.\nA high level committee was set in 1975 to review the problems of urban solid waste in India. This committee covered all aspects of waste management and based on these recommendations, between 1975 and 1980, ten mechanical compost plants were set up in the country.\u00a0 Out of all the plants commissioned there is only one functional at Bangalore.\u00a0 A major step in the direction of managing waste happened with GoI setting up of the National Waste Management Council (NWMC) in 1990.\u00a0 This council provided financial assistance to 22 municipalities to undertake surveys to assist them in improving the MSWM situation (Marandi, 1998).\nAfter the outbreak of the plague epidemic in Surat, the magnitude of the problem was realised by the government.\u00a0 A high powered committee was set up in 1995 which gave many recommendations for the improvement of MSWM like door to door collection, setting up of transfer stations, charging user fees, etc. The ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and CPCB held meeting with the municipalities to evolve a strategy for MSWM.\u00a0 About 50 waste treatment facilities were set up after this.\u00a0 In 1996, the MNES initiated a pilot program to promote waste-to-energy projects in India, which may be considered as the birth of the new era of waste-to-energy programs in India.\nIn India, according to the Ministry of Environment and Forests \"municipal solid waste\" includes commercial and residential wastes generated in municipal or notified areas in either solid or semi-solid form excluding industrial hazardous wastes but including treated bio-medical wastes (MoEF, 2000).\u00a0 In simple words the municipal solid waste can be defined as the waste that is controlled and collected by local authority and municipality.\nAs per the recent estimates, the country produces about 100000 MT urban solid waste daily (The Expert Committee, 2000) with typical characteristics as per the Table 1 below.\u00a0 The municipal waste generation in metro cities varies between 0.2- 0.6 kg/capita/day (Zurbrugg, 2002 and Agarwal, et al 2005), and urban MSW generation is estimated to be approximately 0.49\u00a0kg per capita per day. This is estimated to be two or three times more than the waste generated by rural residents (Devi, et al 2001).\u00a0 The figures, however, vary from city to city. For example, while the per capita waste generated in Delhi is 0.5\u00a0kg per day, MSW generated per capita per day is 0.35\u00a0kg in Hyderabad and 0.64\u00a0kg in Bangalore (Huysman, 1994).\u00a0 According to studies carried out by (NEERI) the per capita waste generated in a typical Indian metropolitan city increases by 1.3% per year while the estimated urban population growth is around 3.5% per annum (Shekdar, et al 1993).\u00a0 These studies point out that there is a large difference between urban and rural level of waste generation, which reflect the economic extremities existing with the Indian society.\nMany studies have been conducted to estimate the composition of waste in Indian cities, as it is an important parameter in choosing the process method to be adopted and the design of the process plant.\u00a0 The studies reveal that the organic fraction of the waste makes up 40 \u2013 75 % of the waste (National Solid waste Association of India, 2003, CPCB, 1998 and NEERI, 2000).\u00a0 Studies have stated that the composition of waste varies depending on the income and life style (Zurbrugg, 2004).\nTable 7: Physical Characteristics of a typical city Municipal Solid Waste\nPopulation range (million)\n30.84\n53.90\nSource : The Expert Committee (2000) Manual on Municipal Solid Waste Management, The Ministry of Urban Development, The Government of India1.\nFrom table 7 we can deduce that in India the overall percentage of inert material in all cities is very high.\u00a0 This can cause hindrance to processes like incineration and anaerobic digestion if the waste is not segregated prior to processing.\u00a0 The percentage of compostable matter is high in all cities, but the cities with a population above five million have a lower percentage of organic matter compared to the cities with a lower population.\u00a0 The cities with a population above 5 million also have a higher percentage of paper and glass material.\u00a0 The cities in India having a population higher than 5 million are also having high income.\u00a0 The waste composition also indicates the same.\nTable 8: Chemical characteristics of Municipal Solid Waste in Indian Cities\nPopulation range (in million)\n30.11\n800.70\nSource : The Expert Committee, 2000. Manual on Municipal Solid Waste Management. The Ministry of Urban Development, The Government of India 1.\nFrom table 8, we can deduce the Indian waste has a high content of organic matter, which makes it suitable for processes like composting and anaerobic digestion.\u00a0 The C/N ratio is between 20-30 and this ratio is very suitable for composting (Eiland, et al, 2001). The waste also has a high moisture content which makes it unsuitable for incineration.\nTable 9: Density of Municipal Solid Wastes in some Cities\nSl.No.\nRaipur\n405\nSource : The Expert Committee (2000) Manual on Municipal Solid Waste Management, The Ministry of Urban Development, The Government of India, Volume 1 and 2\nDensity is another important factor that needs to be estimated as it is essential for the design considering all functional elements of solid waste management system viz. Community storage, transportation and disposal.\u00a0\u00a0 In India, the waste collection vehicle is not weighed in order to estimate the weight; only the number of trips made is counted.\u00a0 This is not appropriate as the density, tends to change from time to time (Shekdar, 1997).\n3.1.1 Storage\nMunicipal Solid Waste is commonly stored in circular concrete open bins in India.\u00a0 There have hardly been any studies conducted on the most suitable type of storage bin for the Indian waste.\u00a0 The waste should be preferably stored in closed bins and for not more than 24hrs, as the Indian waste has high organic content and is highly putricible.\nCollection\nThe waste collection methods that are mainly adopted in India are Door to door collection and Community method.\u00a0 Community bin method has been the most commonly adopted method in India.\u00a0 A study carried out in Indian Institute of Science (Sathishkumar, et al, 2002) describes that in community bin method, the improper placement of bins, bins not designed as per quantity of waste generated and bins not being covered causes problems like odour, stray dog nuisance and unaesthetic appearance.\nOn the other hand, a study conducted on municipal solid waste management describes the collection of waste by Door-to-Door method in Ahmedabad (Sachdeva, 2002).\u00a0 Here the worker uses a pushcart with 6 drums for the separate collection of waste.\u00a0 The householder has to collect the dry waste in plastic bags and biodegradable waste in bins.\u00a0 The worker collects the waste and put it in separate bins.\u00a0 This is then transferred into large storage containers, which are designed as per the population density.\u00a0 The same system has been adopted in Chennai (IPE, 2004).\u00a0 In From these studies, it has been observed that the door to collection method has improved the efficiency of collection of segregated waste.\nThe collection efficiency ranges between 70 to 90% in major cities whereas in several smaller cities the collection efficiency is below 60%.\u00a0 Street sweeping is another type of collection method for the collection of street litter; many cities spend 30-50 % of their solid waste budgets on street cleansing (The Expert Committee, 2000).\nStudies show that in most urban areas it is the slums and areas where the poorer communities reside which are most badly served (Fritz, 1990 and Furedy, 1994). One possible reason could be that municipal authorities give priority to localities where the elite and the better-off populations reside because of their influence and political weight. Meanwhile, the areas which are not serviced are faced with clogged sewers and littered waste, creating serious health problems for the resident population.\n3.1.3 Transfer and Transport\nMany methods have been adopted for the transfer of waste from either the pushcarts to trucks or Bins to truck.\u00a0 In Ahmedabad, door-to-door collection method is adopted.\u00a0 Here once the waste is collected in pushcarts, it is transferred to large covered metal bins having separate compartments for storage of segregated waste.\u00a0 From here it is transferred to the trucks with a mechanized collection truck that lifts the container and empties the waste into the truck (Sachdeva, 2004).\u00a0 This mechanism adopted in Ahmedabad is new and can be found only in select cities in India.\u00a0 The most common method for transfer is manual transfer from community bin to trucks by 2 to 3 workers (The Expert Committee, 2000).\u00a0 The transfer of waste directly from pushcarts to trucks by meeting at a specified time and place called synchronization points is suggested by (Karadimas, 2004), which is a suitable option for the door to door collection method.\nTransportation of waste is carried out by the municipalities employing vehicles like open trucks, tractor-trailers, tipper trucks and dumper placers. According to calculations done on a basis of waste density, waste generated etc. indicate that on an average 320m3 capacity is required for daily transportation of waste generated by 1 million population.\u00a0 However, a study carried out in 1996 stated that out of the 44 cities that were studied, 70% of these cities did not have 320m3 transport capacity (Boyar, et al 1996).\u00a0 Many improvements have been made since then including the introduction of container-carriers and dumper-placers that was done by 1997 (Gupta, et al 1998).\u00a0 Bangalore itself has about 13 dumper placers (Ramachandra, et al, 2003) that do two trips a day.\n3.1.4 Process\n2.1.4.1 Recycling\nThe recycling sector in India has been in operation since the 1960\u2019s and while only a fraction of the total plastic waste is being recycled in most western countries (APME, 1995), around 75% of the plastic wastes are recycled in India (Haque, 1998). Rag pickers mainly carry out the recycling process in India and they play a vital role in the economy of solid waste recycling process (Agarwal, et al 2005).\u00a0 They feed the need of the intermediary buyers, who, in turn, meet the demand of factories using recyclable solid waste as raw materials. However, the rag pickers do not have sufficient protection and are exposed to waste and sometimes even the hazardous waste present in MSW.\u00a0 A study carried out in 2003 has shown that 75 percent rag pickers have upper and lower respiratory symptoms (Bhattacharya, 2005).\u00a0 Even the quality of the successively recycled products in the informal sector in terms of their (i) physical appearance (ii) polymeric properties (iii) health hazards (for the recyclers and users of such products involved) are in serious question (Haque, 2000).\nAnother aspect to be noted is that plastic carry bags and PET do not figure in the list of priorities for rag pickers, because collecting them is not profitable. This is primarily because the rewards do not match the efforts required for collection, and this leads to plastic bags and PET continuing to pose a major threat to the environment (Narayan, 2001).\n2.1.4.2 Composting\nComposting urban waste in India has a long history.\u00a0 Sir Albert Howard developed the Indore process nearly 75 years ago by systemizing the traditional process that was carried out in India (Howard, 1940).\u00a0\u00a0 Government intervention to promote this practice can be traced to the 1940s and the early 1970s, when the national government initiated a scheme to revive urban composting (Selvam, 1996). However, centralized large-scale composting plants in urban areas promoted in the 1970s proved to be uneconomical (Dulac, 2001). Only a few installations are currently still operational (UNDP, 1991).\u00a0 Due to high operating and transport costs and the poorly developed market for compost, the expected profits could not be realized as planned. Composting of mixed waste also had a negative effect on compost quality and, thus, on its acceptance by farmers.\nFrom 1990\u2019s decentralized composting schemes have been implemented by NGO\u2019s with the help of international funding. The decentralized composting schemes became very popular and widespread in a short span of time.\u00a0 Various types of composting have been adopted by these schemes e.g. Bin-composting, Shallow windrow, Pit composting and vermicomposting.\u00a0 However, the maintenance of such schemes proved to be difficult because the household involvement was sporadic, as many people believe that it is the municipal corporation's responsibility to collect waste and do not want to make additional payments. This study states that though decentralized composting has more advantages than centralized composting, the market for MSW compost is limited and is rarely financially competitive to heavily subsidized chemical fertilizers and traditional cow dung or poultry manure (Zurbr\u00fcgg, et al 2002).\nHowever, in Class II, Class III and Class IV cities an urban agricultural set up exists and functions, where there is optimal use of municipal solid waste.\u00a0 The farmers buy the organic waste from the municipality at very low costs and use it as manure.\u00a0 There are also companies that have taken over the responsibility segregating, decontaminating and composting MSW.\u00a0 This high quality compost is then sold to the farmers at a very high cost compared to the raw MSW.\u00a0 It has been observed that the farmers prefer the raw MSW to the processed high quality compost, because the latter is too expensive (Nunan, 2000).\nCurrently, there are few large-scale composting plants around India that are running successfully.\u00a0\u00a0 For e.g. composting plant in Hyderabad run by AP technology development and promotion center (intake of 200MT/day, composting plant in Vijaywada by Exel industries (intake of 125 MT/day), composting plant in Bangalore by Karnataka Compost Development Authority (KCDC)(intake of 300MT/day) and composting plant in Bangalore by Terra Firma Bio-technologies (100MT capacity).\u00a0 All these compost plants have a high demand for their products and want to increase their processing capacity to meet the huge demand.\u00a0 The awareness for organic manure is increasing rapidly in India that will in turn increase the demand for the manure produced from MSW (Garibay, et al, 2003).\n2.1.4.3 Anaerobic Digesters\nBiogas is a successful renewable energy technology developed and disseminated in India, second only to improved wood stoves in its spread.\u00a0 Biogas was first introduced to India as an alternative to piped natural gas in 1897 for providing gas-based illumination (Sathianathan, 1990).\u00a0 The superiority of biogas slurry both as manure as well as compost starter and the cleanliness of the process has been emphasized in several publications of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and other agricultural institutions in the country (Chanakya, et al 2002). However, biogas production has been restricted mostly to rural areas (with cattle dung) and in urban areas (with sewage).\u00a0 The anaerobic digesters used in the rural areas are simple in design and to maintain, but they require constant monitoring and are less efficient.\u00a0 The complex digesters on the other hand, are designed to automatically adjust when environmental conditions change, such as would occur with the feedstock.\u00a0 These are used in developed nations to treat unpredictable waste flows and such digesters would be suitable for processing of MSW (Ostrem, et al, 2004).\u00a0 Many studies have been conducted on the use of MSW for production of Biogas.\u00a0 One of the studies suggests that by having decentralized anaerobic digesters in the localities, the odour problem caused by MSW from bins and during long transportation distances can be minimized (Chanakya, et al, 2002).\u00a0 Apart from this (Srinivasan, 2003, Ramasamy, 2000 and Ostrem, et al, 2004) bring out the dual purpose of anaerobic digesters, not only will they provide a solution to the solid waste crisis, but also to the energy crisis.\nIn India, not many large-scale biomethanisation plants using MSW have been set up. One of the few biomethanation plants set up was in Lucknow that consumed 300 MT/day of MSW to generate 75 MT/day of organic manure and 5.1 MW of electricity.\u00a0 This plant was recently shut down, and the main cause for failure was the intake of unsegregated waste (Gopalakrishna, 2005).\n2.1.4.4 Incineration\nIncineration is another alternative for waste processing that is being used in India.\u00a0 Waste combustion is not a common practice in India. One 120 tonne per day incinerator was built during the 1930s in Calcutta but was operated for only a short period. After this study a Danish incinerator-cum-power plant was installed at Timarpur in North Delhi and was shut down in 1985 due to high maintenance cost. An extensive sample program conducted in India by (Bhide, 1984) reveals that most of the waste had a calorific value of just 3350 joules/g compared with 9200joules/g in high-income countries (Sathiskumar, 2002).\u00a0 Incinerators have been reintroduced in India for energy recovery from municipal solid waste.\u00a0 Recently, the Chennai Municipality had approved a plan to set up a 14.85 MW waste-to-electricity plant at Perungudi. But, due to the opposition of environmentalists the project did not take off (Hindu, 2005).\u00a0 However, in Hyderabad, a private company Selco has set up an incinerator that is running successfully by converting waste to electricity.\u00a0 It takes in 400 tonnes for generating 6 MW of power that is being fed into the grid of the Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (APTransco) (UNDP, 2000 and Hindu, 2004).\nThe main draw back identified for the use of incinerators and anaerobic digesters for processing MSW is that the waste is not segregated prior to the process.\n2.1.4.5 Disposal\nUncontrolled landfilling has been mainly adopted for ultimate disposal of municipal solid waste in India; thereby causing numerous health, environmental and aesthetic hazards (Ambulkar, 2004).\u00a0 However, now landfilling is the most preferred method of disposal of solid wastes as it is an effective and low cost method of disposal (Nissim, 2005).\u00a0 Onionskin method of lying i.e., alternate building rubbish of thickness 30cm and municipal waste with thickness of 1 to 3 m is adopted in few cities like Delhi, Chennai and Hyderabad (CPCB, 1998).\u00a0 However, the number of sanitary landfills are extremely low compared to the dumpsites, where uncontrolled dumping is observed, leveling and provision of earth cover is rarely provided.\u00a0 The rag pickers are further observed to be active at disposal site.\u00a0 Methane gas that is emitted at the landfills is not collected, hence adding to the GHG emissions (Kumar, S., et al 2004).\n3. 2 Audit Municipal Solid waste Management\nAuditing has become an increasingly popular tool to assess the environmental policies, quality of implementation, compliance with national law and regulation etc.\u00a0 Auditing has also been widely used in India especially in industries.\u00a0 The most popular audits that are carried out in India are energy audits (TERI, 2002) followed by environmental management systems audit where waste minimization audit is an integral part (Mannan, 2002). Audits on Municipal waste Management in India is however are very limited.\u00a0 Developed countries have established an auditing institution and carried out audits on urban waste management with regard to performance, compliance, risk, monitoring, existence of waste policy, quality of implementation etc.\nAn audit was carried out by the Estonian Government to assess to what extent are the necessary conditions for the successful implementation of the waste wise policy in place.\u00a0 Reports and questionnaires were used for the audit and it was observed that the management had serious shortcoming such as insufficient finance in comparison to the goal, management lacked organization, no national waste management plan and poor monitoring (Linnas, 2001).\u00a0 Audit Institution of Costa Rica carried out an audit on the solid waste management in two municipalities.\u00a0 This audit had a multiple focus of pollution prevention system, management system and site audit.\u00a0 Since, the solid waste management in Costa Rica is under the Ministry of Health, Ministry of environment and energy.\u00a0 The audit was carried out by collection of reports, interviews, site surveys and partial questionnaires.\u00a0 The audit identified that the ministries were not integrated and that many of plans were repeated.\u00a0 The other findings were insufficient public awareness programs, no introduction of new methodologies and technologies, insufficient financial support received and improper monitoring (INTOSAT, 2002).\nAn audit was carried out by the audit institution of Paraguay on the Cateura dump in Asuncion. This audit focused on the environmental administration by the municipality, the public authority responsible for the dump and on the monitoring by the governmental supervision agency.\u00a0 The management and control of the dump was investigated with regard to national health legislation and technical regulations.\u00a0 Checklists and site surveys were used as tools for this audit.\u00a0 From this audit it was observed that there was no urban cleanliness plan charted out by the municipal authority, serious violations of the legislations, no proper monitoring by the supervision agency and delayed closure of the dump (INTOSAT, 2002).\nVarious methods have been used for MSWM auditing namely report collection and interviews for the audit of the management system, site survey was used for the audit of compliance with national law and regulation, health and safety, pollution prevention system.\u00a0 In this thesis all these techniques have been applied in the case study- Environmental audit of MSWM of Bangalore city.\u00a0 The various aspects that will be looked into are compliance with national law and regulation, occupational health and safety, operational risk, pollution prevention and resource management.\n4. Methods\nThe research approach for the case study was mainly qualitative.\u00a0 Data collection methods included document/literature review, semi-structured interviews, checklists and observation. Information was gathered using a variety of methods to gain a better understanding of the situation, issues, perspectives and priorities.\nTable 10: Resource Material\n1:50,000 Toposheet (57 H/9 and 57 G/12)\nOthers\nEIA study on Mavallipura (Ramky Consultants)\nEIA study on Mandur site (Wilbur Smith Associates Private limited)\nAudit method\nDifferent types of audits was carried out to achieve various objectives\nCompliance audit was carried out to check if the current waste management process has been carried out as per the legislation\nOperational Risk Audit in combination with Pollution prevention Audit was carried out to check the frequency with which an environmental damage occurs and what is the consequence of it.\u00a0 The measures that have been taken against these possible environmental damages were verified.\nResource Management Audit was carried out to check the quantity of water, energy and material resources used to carry out a process and if the process has been carried out by optimal utilization of resources\nOccupational Risk Audit was carried out to verify if all the measures towards the safety of the staff have been taken\nTo achieve this in each topic a list of necessities were listed in a checklist in regard to the specific target and the presence and absence of each was marked.\nSite survey for seven representative sample wards (Shivajinagar, Malleswaram, Koramangala, IISc, H.M T, Airport Road and Chikpet) in Bangalore city was carried out. A checklist was prepared prior to the visit to check the presence or absence of techniques used, safety measures adopted, compliance with regulatory measures and pollution prevention system adopted.\u00a0 Interviews of health Inspectors, workers and lorry drivers were done at the ward level to assist the checklist.\u00a0 The higher officials were interviewed to have a basic understanding of the structure of the system and how it is managed.\u00a0 The officials interviewed were the range health officers, zonal health officers, Chief health Officer and the Special Commissioner.\nThe interviews with the higher officials helped to understand the management system, their objectives and the strategies adopted that have proved to be efficient, the strategies that have failed and what are the issues that have been faced in implementing these strategies.\nThe Site surveys and ward level interviews helped to identify the lacuna in the ground level, to verify if the process is being carried out as expected at what are the lacuna and loop holes in each functional element.\nSite visits to the Karnataka Compost development Authority, Terra Firma Biotechnologies, Betahalli dump yard, K.

Puram dump yard and quarry site in Bomanhalli.\nGeographic Information System (GIS)\nBangalore city base layer was prepared in consultation with Survey of India toposheet 59 H/9 and 59 G/12 (scale 1:50,000) using Mapinfo 6.0 (GIS software).\u00a0 Ward maps and city boundary maps were created with reference to the existing base layer.\nDifficulties and limitations\nTime and financial constraints precluded the possibility of a more rigorous approach for data collection in Bangalore.\u00a0 There was a lack of data available in few aspects such as weight of waste generated and composition per ward, the trip record of trucks, etc.\u00a0 The site visits to the wards was not sufficient to get the exact picture of the process.\u00a0 It was difficult to identify all the open dumps and quarry sites used for disposal, as the authorities didn\u2019t have knowledge about the location of open dumps.\u00a0 Data on the informal sector was not obtained, as there was no \u2018single window\u2019 data source about them.\n5. A Case Study- Environmental Audit of MSWM in Bangalore city\nThe city of Bangalore, the State capital of Karnataka is located on the southern part of the Deccan Plateau near the border of two other South Indian states namely Tamil Nada and Andhra Pradesh.\u00a0 At an elevation of 900m it is known for its mild, salubrious climate.\u00a0 Since 1980s, Bangalore has enjoyed the reputation of being one of the fastest growing cities in Asia (Dittrich, 2004). The Bangalore metropolitan area covers an area of 223 sq km, and is the fifth largest city in India.\u00a0 It falls on latitudes 12.97\u00b0N and 77.56\u00b0E.\u00a0 It has many industries and it is home to more than 30% of the IT companies in India.\u00a0 For many years, Bangalore has ranked first among the other Indian cities in terms of Image and popularity.\u00a0 However, with burgeoning population and increasing necessities of the IT sector, the local authorities are not being able to provide the necessary services like solid waste management, water supply, road maintenance etc to a satisfactory level.\u00a0 The authorities however have taken initiatives and measures to achieve compliance with regulations and reduce complaints from citizens especially in the MSWM sector. The case study would help to identify the positive measures taken by the authorities and the other stakeholders.\u00a0 This would help to identify techniques suitable for the present scenario, the lacuna or the loopholes in the adopted methods and the possible alternatives.\nFigure 3: Bangalore Ward Map\nFigure 4: Bangalore map representing population density per ward\n5.1 Sanitation\nThe Department of Health as a separate department was felt in 1887 when the Senior Surgeon was appointed as ex-officio Sanitary Commissioner.\u00a0 The out break of Plague in Bangalore in 1898 caused the creation of the post of the Health Officer for Bangalore City and the first health officer was appointed on Second October 1898.\u00a0 The health department was reorganized in 1907 with the appointment of whole-time Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in 1907. A central sanitary board and District sanitary board was organized for the improvement of Sanitation.\u00a0 In 1917 a full time Sanitary Commissioner was appointed.\u00a0 In 1929 the sanitary department was separated for the medical department and the department was named as the Health Department and the Sanitary Commissioner as the Director of Health.\u00a0 A central health committee was created.\u00a0 The Department of Health was divided into seven bureaux, the Bureau of Administration, the Bureau of Epidemiology and Communicable diseases, Bureau of Laboratories, Bureau of Vital Statistics, Bureau of Health Education, Bureau of Sanitary Engineering and the bureau of Rural Health.\nThe Sanitary conditions of the city prior to 1877 were irregular.\u00a0 The open drainage caused bad smell and there was only one sewage cart to dispose of the filth.\u00a0 Public health measures assumed much importance with the out break of plague in 1898.\u00a0 In March 1898, a loan was granted to the Bangalore Municipality by the Government for sanitary improvements, such as cleaning and repairing of drains, repairing of buildings, demolishing of dirty and unoccupied buildings, etc.\nIn June 1960, the curative and preventive services, which were separate till then, were amalgamated at the taluk level and below under the control of the District Health Officer and the Health and Medical department were combined into Directorate of Health services, each district being headed by a District Health Officer.\u00a0 The duties of the Health Officer consist of supervision and control of epidemics supervision of sanitary arrangements, examination of drinking water supply, health propaganda work, etc.\u00a0 He is responsible for all the health programmes, both National and State at the district level.\u00a0 The Bangalore City Corporation has its own heath department headed by the Health Officer to look after the sanitation and to carry out health programs in the city.\nDistrict Health and Family Welfare: In 1988 the City Corporation Health Department was headed by the Health Officer, assisted by Four divisional health officers, two surgeons, 43 assistant surgeons, 15 medical officers, one chemical analyst, Aurvedic and Unani pandits one each, 30 lady medical officers, one senior biologist, one district health educator, 50 senior and 161 junior health supervisors, 34 lady health visitors, 13 managers and 9451 other staff including medical, para-medical, office staff and others.\u00a0 There were 6,851 Pourakamikas in the city.\n5.2 Ward Wise Population of Bangalore City Corporation, 2001\nBangalore City Corporation with seven wards was formed in 1949 by merging two independent municipalities viz., Bangalore City and Bangalore Cantonment. Since then, the number of wards has been on the increase due to incorporation of surrounding areas on a continuous basis and also due to the ever-increasing population of the city.\u00a0 In the 1971 Census Bangalore City was divided into 63 wards, which remained the same in the 1981 Census. In the 1991 Census, Bangalore City had 87 wards and in the 2001 Census the number of wards has gone up to 100.\u00a0 The Bangalore City Corporation, which has 100 wards within its municipal jurisdiction, has a population of 4,292,223 accounting for 75.48 per cent of the total population of Bangalore Urban Agglomeration of which 2,240,956 are males and 2,051,267 are females.\u00a0 The decadal growth rate of population for the decade 1991-2001 for Bangalore City is as high as 61.36 per cent. This high growth rate can be attributed not only to the extension of the municipal limits of Bangalore City but also to the ever-increasing population.\n5.3 Current MSWM practice in Bangalore City\nThe current MSWM has been shown below in the flow chart and is explained in detail in the\nFigure 5 : Current MSWM practice in Bangalore city\nThe Bangalore Metropolitan Area is on the whole divided into 30 ranges and 100 Revenue wards.\u00a0 For the proper management of the sanitation functions these wards have been further divided into 294 health wards.\u00a0 Out of these 294 health wards 112 are BMP wards and 182 are Contract wards.\u00a0 The budget allocation for MSWM is approximately Rs.70 crores per annum.\u00a0 There are 5000 employees and 7000 contract persons working in two shifts, their salaries alone cost the corporation 24 crores per annum.\u00a0 The amount of waste generated in Bangalore city varies from 1700 MT/day to 2300 MT/day and the composition of waste is as given in Table 11.\nTable 11: Physical characteristics of Bangalore Municipal Solid Waste\nOrganic waste (%)\n1\nSource : BMP\nThe quantification of the solid waste is essential for designing and monitoring the sanitary landfill sites for the solid waste disposal.\u00a0 However, BMP does not possess weighing facility and thus information is not available for the quantity of waste generated in the past.\u00a0 The composition of waste for the entire city has been found as given in table 11, but the composition of waste ward wise has still not been identified.\nCollection\nThe most common method of collection in Bangalore city right now is door-to-door collection method followed by the community bin collection method. In 2003, the door-to-door collection method was implemented in 60 health wards. Table 12 gives the details of health wards having door-to-door collection in 2003.\nTable 12: Health Wards Covered under House-to-House Collection in 2003\nSr. No.\n69a, 70a, 71a, 74c, 75a, 77b, 78c, 80b, 86a, 90b, 91b, 92b, 98a, 99b\n15\n2.\nSouth Zone\n31, 32a, 33a, 34a, 36c, 42b, 43b, 44a, 44b, 45a, 46a, 47a, 47b, 48a, 49a, 50a, 50c, 51a, 51b, 52a, 58a, 58c, 59a, 60a, 61a, 62a, 62b\n27\n4b, 5a, 7b, 8a, 9b, 10, 14a, 15a, 21c, 24a, 25a, 27a, 28a, 29b, 30\n18\n60\nSource : BMP\nAs per the current record all the wards in the city have door-to-door collection and all the community bins have been removed.\u00a0 However, during site survey it was observed that many of the wards still have community bins that are in a very dilapidated state.\nTable 13: Vegetable / Fruit Markets\nSr. No.\nMalleshwaram Vegetable and Fruit Market\n3.\nJhaman Market, Chicken, Poultry, Vegetable etc.\n10.\n12.\nVinaynagar Market\nA large quantity of organic waste is generated from the markets. This waste is collected using separate trucks once every morning and evening.\nTransfer and Transport\nThe waste collected in pushcarts from lanes is transferred to a truck at a meeting point called a synchronization point.\u00a0 The truck arrives at the synchronisation point at a specified time and place.\u00a0 The waste is transported to disposal site by means of a large capacity tipper truck and in few wards by a small capacity tipper truck or dumper placers.\u00a0 The truck is covered with a mesh and a polythene sheet to prevent scattering.\u00a0 Currently Bangalore city has no transfer stations for intermediate storage of waste and intermediate segregation of waste.\nTable 14: The Type and number of vehicles in Bangalore Metropolitan Area\nType of Vehicle\nDumper placer with one container (3.5 m3 cap.)\n13\nProcess\nKarnataka Compost Development Authority (KCDC)\nThe Karnataka Compost Development Corporation (KCDC) was one of 11 composting units set up in 1975 based on the technology suggested by WHO. Within a year, 10 of these units had to be closed, because the technology suggested by WHO was unable to successfully handle composting of unsegregated Indian waste. Also the usage of raspers (crushing and grinding machines) caused problems selling the compost because the quality was poor due to existence of glass splinters and other non-biodegradable material.\nIn the 70ies, on 15 acres of land KCDC processed 50-60 tons of mixed waste per day. By 2002 the capacity was expanded to 8.95 hectares, processing 150 tons/day. Currently the units process 250 tons/day of mixed waste plus 50 tons/day of market waste, which is collected using vehicles owned by KCDC.\nWaste heaps (approx. 3.96m wide, 3.05m high and of varying length) are shaped using 3 pay loaders (Front End Loaders). These vehicles are also used for turning the heaps. Cowdung slurry (made by adding 2 baskets of fresh cowdung to 200 litres of water) is used as starter culture, which is sprayed onto the waste heaps.\nThe microbial degradation process starts on the same day the waste is made into windrows on the compost yard. This degradation occurs as a two staged process. First a high temperature stage (70-75 \u00b0C) lasting for 10-15 days is performed followed by a middle temperature stage (40-45 \u00b0C). Waste material only going through a composting process stays in the heaps for about 60 days. For the planned vermicomposting process, partly composted material (after 25-30 days) is taken from the heaps and piled into bins. After leaving the waste for 3-4 days to bring the temperature down to 27-30 degrees, worms are introduced. Four species of African worms are used for this process. This vermicomposting in bins takes about 30-40 days, depending on worm density. A top layer of vermicastings is harvested every 3 days and sieved by a rotary screen.\nAerobic windrows go through 4 sieving stages after 60 days. Mesh size is 50 mm, 25 mm, 8 mm and 4 mm, all through rotary screen. The 50 mm screen removes 80-90% of the non-biodegradables, which amount to 30% by weight. Two Bobcats are used for cleaning the site and feeding the rotary screens and spreading coarse compost for soaking up leachate from the heaps.\nThe compost is then packed and sold and the rejects are emptied into the Adgowdi quarry site, which is 7 km away from the composting plant.\u00a0 It is observed that waste pickers are active at the plant site for collection of recyclables such as tin, glass, plastic, rubber, etc.\u00a0 The plant authorities have given contract for waste picking and transport rejects to a private contractor.\nPlain 4 mm compost is sold at Rs 950/ton. Enriched compost contains 75% plain compost + 2.5-3% Rock phosphate ( Rs 3300/t) + Neem cake ( Rs 3900/ton) + 5-6% poultry manure (400/ton) + 5-6% sugar-factory press mud ( 350/ton). It is sold for Rs 1600 per ton locally or Rs 2700 per ton at Bidar in far north Karnataka. The composts are used on farms, estates and plantations, and sold through the Dept of Agriculture or Horticulture, with subsidies. These Departments are given 2 months\u2019 credit, and dealer margins are 10-15%. Vermicompost is sold at Rs 2.75 per kg unbagged, or Rs 3.40-3.50 per kg in 50-kg bags. City sales are at Rs 4 per kg, door delivery.\nTerra Firma Bio-technologies\nTerra-Firma Bio-Technologies Limited is one of the first private enterprises in India, which produces compost from urban waste by applying a vermicomposting technology on a medium scale (Shah et al., 1997). It was motivated by opportunities caused by liberalization in India, decreasing subsidies for chemical fertilizers and the garbage problem in Bangalore. Commercial production was started in 1994 after several years of experimentation with the composting process and the cultivation of earthworms.\nTerra-Firma is a sister company of Blue Crystal Agro, which has been producing agro- chemicals and other fertilizers since 1985.\u00a0\u00a0 Currently they have 2.03 hecatres of land at the Baneragatta Road.\u00a0 The present input to the plant site is approximately 100TPD.\u00a0 Out of this input lesser than 25 TPD is collected and transported from Bangalore vegetable markets.\u00a0 The rest of the inputs come from agricultural waste.\u00a0 The waste received is stored in storage tanks and is mixed with coir, press mud, EM solution and allowed to decompose for 30 days.\u00a0 Many additives are also used to enrich the waste including poultry waste, cow dung, water hyacinth, algae, micronutrients etc.\u00a0 It is transferred to RCC tanks to which earthworms are added.\u00a0 The waste in the tank is turned regularly and aerated through pipes.\u00a0 The castings are scrapped from the top layer, sieved and packed for sale.\u00a0 The entire process takes about 2 months to complete.\nThe total Municipal waste generated is estimated to be around 2500 TPD.\u00a0 Out of this quantity, a total of about 400 TPD is sent to three facilities for converting to compost or vermicompost.\u00a0 The rejects from these facilities are disposed off into nearby quarry pits or debris yards.\u00a0 The balance of 2100TPD is not processed and being disposed in either one of the official or unauthorized dump yard around the city.\nProposal for Waste to Energy Plant\nSrinivas Gayathri Resource Recovery (SGRR) has proposed to set up a plant for Waste to Energy conversion.\u00a0 This plant is to be located adjacent to Mandur landfill site.\u00a0 At present 10.12 hectares of land has been allotted for this project.\u00a0 This project proposes to set up a plant for converting Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) to fuel pellets, as well as fuel that finds use in the industry for heating purposes.\u00a0 This MSW processing plant proposal is based on the technology developed on pilot scale by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.\u00a0 The fuel fluff/pellets made of segregated Indian waste has proven to have a calorific value of 3000- 3500 Kcal/kg with a moisture content of 10% at the final stage.\u00a0 It is proposed that excess fuel being produced at SGRR Pvt. Ltd will be sold to industries having Coal fired boilers as well as biomass based power plants.\nHowever, no plan has yet been proposed for the selection of wards from where the waste is to be collected and the strategy to be adopted for segregated waste collection.\nDisposal\nBetahalli (Mavallipuram) dump yard\nThe Betahalli dump yard is situated 18 km North West of Bangalore city.\u00a0 This is a private property of 4.86 hectares out of which 3.24 hecatres is being used for dumping of MSW.\u00a0 The remaining acreage has banana plantations.\u00a0 This property has eucalyptus plantations surrounding it on two sides. There are few localities that are coming up in the vicinity of the dump yard at about 2 km distance. There is a water body at a distance of 3 km and an Air force airbase at a distance of 8.5 km.\nThe waste is brought in by the municipal and contract lorries.\u00a0 This waste is dumped in the yard in a form a heap.\u00a0 There are three JCB\u2019s\u00a0 (Front End Loaders) in the dump yard for the leveling of waste once it is dumped.\u00a0 As per the instructions given by BMP, the waste should be sprayed with EM (Effective Micro organisms) solution, covered with a 10cm layer of debris and sprayed with water once it is leveled.\u00a0 The solution used for spraying is prepared by mixing 4 lts of EM solution with 8 kg of molasses or Jaggery and 150 lts of water.\u00a0 After mixing it is allowed to stay for 7-8 days after which the pH reduces to 3.4.\u00a0 Once the pH reaches 3.4 the solution is said to be ready for use.\u00a0 The EM stock solution composition is as follows:\nLactic Acid Bacteria\nSaccharomyces sp.\nPropionibacterium sp.\nThis solution speeds up the degradation process of the MSW and reduces the volume, flies and odour.\nThe observations made on the site are :\nA large number of rag pickers collect recyclable waste from the landfill and pay a small amount to have access to the waste.\nThere is a recycling dealer in the dump yard itself who buys the recyclable material from the rag pickers and there is one dealer on the way to the dump yard that buys the recyclable waste from the lorry driver.\nThe leveling of MSW after dumping is not carried out efficiently due to less number of front end loaders\nThe foul odour was strong and could be got at long distances.\nLarge number of flies, birds and stray dogs.\nThere is emission of methane gas from the dump yard, due to which the waste can be easily set on fire.\nThere is always a queue of at least 5-10 Lorries waiting to unload; this is due to the lack of number of front-end loaders to level the MSW.\nThis dump yard has no fencing, weigh bridge and no proper approach roads.\nProposed Sanitary landfill Sites\nThere are currently four composting plants cum sanitary landfill sites cum proposed, they are\nMavallipura- Bangalore North Taluk\nKananhalli- Bangalore North Taluk\nMavallipura Site Features\nThe proposed site situated at Mavallipura village, Hesargatta Zone, Bangalore North, Bangalore, Karnataka shall be used for the processing of municipal solid waste generated from Bangalore

a sanitary landfilling.\u00a0 However, since the vicinity to the village and drinking water supply is close.\u00a0 The landfilling should be carried out with strict monitoring.\nKannahalli Site\nKannahalli site is located near Magadi Road at approximately 20km from Bangalore.\u00a0 The land currently available is 11.60 hectares.\u00a0 BMP would endeavor to make available a total of 28.34 hectares for the project.\u00a0 The soil cover is suitable for landfill cover with permeability co-efficient of 1.76 * 10-6 cm/sec.\u00a0 There is a level difference of approximately 17m in the middle of the site.\u00a0 Ground water is available at 76-107m.\u00a0 Karnataka Pollution Control Board has authorized this site, but due to public agitation against the setting up sanitary landfill, this project has been stalled.\n5.4 The Stakeholders and their responsibilities\nMinistry of Environment and Forests is responsible for all of the environmental policy at the national level, including the management of waste.\u00a0 The Ministry has an overview of all the activities of the MSWM sector and makes sure that it is performed well.\nCentral Pollution Control Board keeps a check on all the activities that have potential to pollute the environment, which includes the monitoring of the municipal solid waste management in the country.\u00a0 It has divisions in each state that report to CPCB on the environmentally hazardous activities in the state, the actions taken towards them and the improvements made by the industries and public towards a cleaner environment.\nKarnataka Pollution Control Board keeps a check on all the activities that have potential to pollute the environment, which includes the monitoring of the municipal solid waste management in the state.\u00a0 It reviews the Environmental Impact Assessment carried out by the agencies prior to the construction of a landfill site, installation of an incinerator or any other processing plant.\u00a0 It carries out public participation meeting to make the public aware of the proposed project and its benefits.\u00a0 Public participation is especially important so that once the project is started there should not be any agitation against the project.\nBangalore Mahanagara Palike is responsible for the making of the solid waste management policy, setting up the targets and objectives.\u00a0 They are responsible for managing the solid waste in the city and are answerable to the State Board and Karnataka pollution control Board.\u00a0 They also have the authority to privatize the solid waste management sector.\nOrganizational Structure of Health Department\nThe MSWM is the responsibility of the Bangalore Mahangara Palike, where the health department has been mainly in charge of all the activities.\u00a0 The hierarchy of the Health Department in charge of SWM is a pyramidal structure headed by Chief Health Officer.\u00a0 For effective administration, the city has been divided three zones namely east, west and south.\u00a0 A Zonal Health Officer administers each zone.\u00a0 There are two Deputy Health Officers to assist him.\u00a0 Each zone consists of 10 ranges headed by a Medical Officer of Health.\u00a0 Each Medical Officer of Health is assisted by Senior, Junior Health Inspectors and Sanitary Daffedars.\u00a0 The field worker who is employed in the sanitation work is known as pourakarmika.\nNGOs / CBOs\nSwabhimana, Waste wise, Swachha Bangalore, Shuchi Mitras etc are few of the NGOs/CBOs that support the MSWM in the city.\u00a0 Their functions are stated below:\nThey carry out public grievance meeting to identify the problem spots and convey these complaints to the authorities\nThey collaborate with authorities to carry out the door-to-door collection of segregated waste\nThey identify public volunteers to monitor the solid waste management in their respective areas.\nFew NGOs have also set up decentralized composting plants in residential areas and for this they also carry out door-to-door collection and educate public to segregate the waste prior to disposal.\nThey carry out public meetings in schools, colleges, public places etc to educate the public about segregation of waste, non-littering, etc\nPrivate formal sector\nCurrently out of the 294 health wards in Bangalore city, 182 wards have been given out on a private contract.\u00a0 This includes the functions of collection of waste, transfer of waste to trucks, transport of waste to the specified dump yard.\u00a0\u00a0 The dump yards that are currently being used are all owned by private entities\u00a0\u00a0 They have the responsibility of disposing of the waste by alternative layering of waste and soil, spraying it with EM solution and water.\nKarnataka Pollution Control Board (KCDC) is a government-aided organization.\u00a0 This carries out the function of composting (windrow and vermicomposting).\nTerra Firma Biotechnologies is a private organization that carries out vermicomposting\nRamky Consultants is a private consultancy proposing to set up a sanitary landfill site in Bangalore.\nSrinivas Gayathri Resource Recovery is a private consultancy proposing to set up a waste to energy plant and a sanitary landfill site in Bangalore.\nPrivate informal sector\nThe informal sector in the city is very large and plays a very vital role in the MSWM.\u00a0 It comprises of the rag pickers who retrieve recyclable waste from the community bins and landfills, the people who buy recyclable waste from households usually called as \u2018batli wallas\u2019, the middlemen who buy waste from the rag pickers and \u2018batli wallas\u2019 and sell it to either bigger dealers or to recycling factories.\u00a0 Municipal workers like the pourakarmika collects waste from the households and retrieve the recyclable waste, even the lorry workers retrieve the recyclable waste before transferring the waste into the lorry.\u00a0 The waste retrieved by them is sold to the informal sector.\nDonor agencies\nDCN (Development corporation of Norway), GTZ (Deutsch Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit) and WHO (World Health Organization) are few of the international organizations that have sponsored projects in Bangalore.\u00a0 WHO has sponsored large scale composting plants all over India and DCN has sponsored decentralized plants all over Bangalore.\nService users comprise of the entire public in the city and also include the tourists visiting the city.\nTable 17: Existing partnerships for managing solid wastes\nPartnerships\nCollection & supply of

The community bin storage has been provided only to 40% of the commercial area resulting in disposal of waste on roadsides due to high rate of waste generation in these areas.\u00a0 The door-to-door collection is carried out in residential and commercial areas. In residential areas there are few dilapidated bins that have unaesthetic appearance, and are not used efficiently.\u00a0 75% of the trucks used have partial polythene covering that has lead to scattering of waste and foul odour during transportation.\nRecycling is carried out by the informal sector this has lead to a high efficiency in recovery of waste, but PET and thin plastic bags are not recovered.\u00a0 The final disposal is carried out in open dump yard resulting in scattering, foul odour, leachate formation and air pollution.\nTable 19:\u00a0 MSWM in Malleswaram (Ward 7)\nFunction\nSuggestion\nStorage\nThe waste is stored in households and in shops until it is collected by the door to door collector\nCollection\nDoor to Door method -

overflowing bins.\u00a0 The bins are also not sufficient in number.\u00a0 The door-to-door method adopted is not sufficient for collection of waste in a crowded commercial area like Chikpet.\u00a0 The segregation of waste is not taking place during collection.\u00a0 There is no transfer station present and the waste is directly disposed in dump, resulting in high transportation cost.\u00a0 There is also no processing of waste that is done prior to disposal.\u00a0 The waste is disposed in Betahalli dump yard causing foul odour, scattering of waste, water pollution through leachate contamination and emission of toxic gases.\nTable 25: Overall Result of the wards\nFunction\n% Area covered in commercial areas\n40\n% Area covered in residential areas\n100\nTruck with mesh and polythene cover %\n75\n% Of waste for anaerobic digestion\n% Of waste incinerated\n85\n21.14\nConsidering the above wards to be a representative sample of Bangalore city, we can infer the following: In Bangalore the waste is stored in open or closed community bins.\u00a0 Out of the community bins present the average percentage of bins covered is 49 %.\u00a0\u00a0 The collection of the waste is carried out by community bin method and door-to-door method.\u00a0 From the previous explanations, we know that it is essential that we have community bins along with door-to-door collection in commercial areas.\u00a0 The percentage of area covered by community bin in commercial areas is 34%.\u00a0 Door to door collection method has been implemented in all areas of the city as it is a suitable method for collection from residential areas and also suitable for collection of segregated waste.\u00a0 In Bangalore door-to-door collection has been implemented in 94% of the residential areas.\u00a0 However, only 3 % of the waste is segregated at source.\u00a0 There are currently no transfer stations in Bangalore and all the waste is directly transported to the disposal site.\u00a0 This is very expensive and the efficiency of the trucks is not utilized to the maximum.\u00a0 As per regulations all trucks should have mesh and polythene covering.\u00a0 However, only 96% of the trucks have mesh covering and 41.43% of the trucks have polythene covering.\u00a0 The quantity of waste processed is very low.\u00a0 The informal sector in the city manages the recycling sector, 18% of the total waste generated is recycled by this sector.\u00a0 The other process method adopted in the city is composting.\u00a0 3.14% of the waste is reduced through composting.\u00a0 The final quantity of waste sent to the dump yard and quarry (open dump) is 60.71% and 21.14 respectively.\nTable 26:\u00a0 Technique adopted and Resource management in all wards\nResource management\nPush cart with drum (with

brigade should be kept alert and fire emergency training should be given to the staff\nOpen dumping is prohibited\nDogs and rodents are rampant in dump yards.\u00a0 The necessary medicines should be kept ready in case of dog or rodent bites\nStorage : from the audit it was observed that the placement of bins has not been done keeping in mind the population density and the quantity of waste generated.\u00a0 There is a lack of community bins in few of the commercial area.\u00a0 Due to the high generation of waste in commercial areas, the waste is not always stored on site, but disposed on the roadsides causing unaesthetic appearance.\u00a0 Well-designed community bins have to be placed in commercial areas depending on the quantity of waste generated.\u00a0 The maintenance of the present bins is poor and has resulted in rusted bins having sharp edges.\u00a0 This can prove to be dangerous to the collection staff and also to the users.\u00a0\u00a0 The staff must be provided with well fitting gloves for safety.\nCommunity bins also should be provided with partition for separate collection of waste and proper coloring and labeling on the bins.\u00a0 To improve the separation of waste at source and throughout the MSWM process, adequate staffing, supervision, procedures, training, posters, verbal reminders, reporting, meetings and equipment are required.\nCollection : Adopting door-to-door collection method has proved to have many advantages.\u00a0 The complaints from residents due unaesthetic bins near their houses have stopped, there is reduced number of stray dogs and stray cattle and the no bin system has also improved the waste handling by people or residents.\u00a0 This method is also better suited for collection of segregated waste.\u00a0 However, door-to-door collection method has its own considerations.\u00a0 In commercial areas, due to higher quantity of waste generation, the shopkeeper finds it difficult to store the waste on site and hence this waste ends up on the street.\nThough separate drums have been provided for collection of segregated waste, neither the household nor the pourakarmika is carrying out segregation.\u00a0 This is due poor awareness and general attitude of public and pourakarmikas.\u00a0 The number of awareness programs and training programs carried out by the authorities need to be increased and should be at a regular frequency.\u00a0 It has to be kept in mind that such practices are not easy to instill and will take a many months or even years to implement.\u00a0 Here again adequate staffing, supervision, procedures, training, posters, verbal reminders, reporting, meetings and equipment are required to make it possible.\u00a0 The participation of NGOs/CBOs in such programs can prove to be very helpful to the authorities in making this a success.\nDuring door-to-door collection the pourakarmika manually segregates the waste.\u00a0 It is very important that this is carried out with proper protection like gloves.\u00a0 The staff should be provided with gloves, footwear, apron, masks and goggles for safety as they are in constantly exposed to waste every day.\nTransfer and Transport :\nThe innovative idea of synchronization points that has been adopted by the municipality to transfer waste from pushcarts to trucks has proved to be successful.\u00a0 This has reduced the spillage, no space is occupied for intermediate storage and collection happens on time as the workers and trucks have to meet as a specified time and location for the transfer.\u00a0 The transfer of small drums is also much easier and safer than transfer of waste from large community bins.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trucks that are currently used do not have provision for separate collection of waste.\u00a0 This results to the mixing of waste even if the waste is collected separately.\u00a0 Trucks can either be provided with partition or two trucks can be provided.\u00a0 One truck for the collection of organic and mixed waste and another truck for collection of recyclable waste.\u00a0 The truck for recyclable waste can have a frequency of once in 3 days as the quantity of recyclable waste generated is much lesser compared to organic waste.\u00a0 Transfer of waste is carried out manually so it is very important to have proper safety gear like gloves, apron, masks and goggles during transfer.\nThe vehicles used for the transportation of waste are in a good condition.\u00a0 Most of the trucks have a mesh covering and about 50-60% also have the polythene covering.\u00a0 However, there is no proper enclosure provided to prevent the wet waste from leaking on to the road.\u00a0 It is very essential that all trucks have mesh and polythene covering with a proper enclosure to prevent scattering of waste, foul odour and leakage when traveling on crowded roads.\nTreatment Process\nThe only treatment option that is provided for Bangalore city is composting.\u00a0 This is carried out only for 400MT/day while the total amount of waste generated is 2300MT/day.\u00a0 There have been proposals for setting up three integrated waste management sites that has composting and sanitary landfills.\u00a0 This actions needs to be hastened to prevent the excessive damage being caused by open dumping of large quantities of waste very day.\u00a0 Other treatment options also should be considered like decentralized anaerobic digesters near markets.\u00a0 This will not only produce biogas but also reduce the transportation cost of waste to landfill sites.\u00a0 Waste to Energy plants like production of refuse derived fuels and incineration plants can be set up to use waste from commercial areas once source segregation process is set in place.\nDisposal\nIn the current MSWM system, the function that has been totally ignored is that of final disposal of MSW.\u00a0 The current method of disposal adopted as explained earlier is extremely hazardous to the environment and can cause irreversible damage to the surrounding area.\u00a0 The unauthorized open dumping of waste is also carried out near crowded slum areas.\u00a0 This is extremely hazardous to the people living around that area.\u00a0 The identification and closure of such dumps should be given the top most priority.\u00a0 The setting up the proposed sanitary landfill sites with integrated composting plants should be hastened.\nSome important factors that need to be considered for the overall improvement of the waste management system are :\nData management : to improve data management there should be commitment to improving reliability of the waste data from the staff and authorities.\u00a0 Greater confidence in data will help in monitoring the efficiency of the collection, transportation, process and disposal option.\u00a0 It will also help in monitoring the unauthorized activities, by monitoring the number of trucks and trips made by trucks to the specified disposal site.\nTraining and Education : Environmental education is a way of increasing understanding of problems, cooperation among stakeholders, environmental entrepreneurship and environmental performance.\u00a0 The training should be a regular feature of MSWM.\u00a0 Demonstrations should be given on sorting and collection.\u00a0 After training there should be follow up of the practices.\u00a0 The staff should be made to understand the importance and the implication of their activity.\nHealth and Safety program : It has been a common observation that in Bangalore the staff does not use the protection gear that is provided to them.\u00a0 Regular health and safety programs should be carried out to educate the staff on the ill effects of manual handling of waste, walking bare foot in dump yards and continuous exposure to waste.\u00a0 Regular health check ups should be carried out to monitor the health of the workers.\nInvolvement of the community : The community involvement in waste management monitoring programs like Suchi Mitra should be encouraged and more people should be involved in such activities.\u00a0 This increases the environmental awareness of the participants and the surrounding people.\u00a0 This is one of the fastest ways to make public understand the importance of activities like sorting.\nIntegration of Waste pickers : The NGOs/CBOs should organize waste pickers and methods of retrieving waste from the source by the waste pickers should be developed, instead of the waste pickers retrieving waste at the dump yard which is extremely hazardous to their health.\u00a0 Additionally, the waste pickers should be paid to retrieve waste from process plants and dump yards, instead of them paying to get access the waste.\u00a0 Ways of improving the working conditions of the waste pickers and providing safety gear for them should be developed\nPlanning : The waste management that is carried out currently is more of low cost measures to comply with regulation, avoid public agitation and complaints.\u00a0 There is no environmental management planning that is taken into consideration.\u00a0 Improper planning before the setting up the sanitary landfill sites has lead to increased public agitation and legal complications that have delayed the project for a very long period.\nAlthough an informal approach to problem solving may have worked reasonably well while the program was relatively small, a more systematic and proactive approach to management is required when the complexity of the program increases. This would help to ensure that requirements are handled in a consistent and professional way and problems are addressed promptly and effectively.\u00a0 This would also ensure that the staff has a clear objective and goal while carrying out their activities.\nMonitoring : the monitoring of the activities during collection, transfer, process and disposal needs to become an integral part of the waste management system until all the activities follow the required standard.\u00a0 The municipal authority not only has to monitor their own staff activities but also the activities carried out by the private organizations carrying out their services.\u00a0 The State pollution control board has to carry out regular inspections of the dump yards and stop open dumping as it causes serious air and water pollution problems.\nPublic participation : Currently the main hindrance for the implementation of the sanitary landfill sites is due to public agitation.\u00a0 It is very essential that before any project is implemented public participation meeting to make the public aware of the technology used in sanitary landfill and what will be the impacts.\n7. FURTHER WORK\nDirections for future research emerging from this case study include a health study of waste workers, feasibility study of Waste to Energy plant and collection of methane gas from landfill site\nAn occupational health study of waste workers would increase knowledge about the impact on health of working with biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste streams. The study could include: identifying and assessing health concerns and causes of health effects, evaluating the adequacy of protective equipment, and comparing occupational risks from various professions. Findings from the study could be integrated in the health and safety program at the MRF to increase health awareness and develop strategies to reduce health risks.\nWaste to energy plants using combustion of municipal solid waste is one of the controversial topics of today.\u00a0 Bangalore has also proposed to set up a Waste to Energy plant.\u00a0 The plant proposes to convert municipal solid waste to fuel pellets or fuel fluff to be used in industries for heating purposes.\u00a0 The study could bring to light if the Bangalore waste composition is suitable for such a process, select wards from which the waste composition is suitable for this process and develop segregation method in these wards.\nThree landfill sites are being set up in Bangalore.\u00a0 All the three landfill sites do not propose collection of methane gas from landfill sites, as it is an integrated plant including composting and only the rejects will go into the landfill.\u00a0 Methane gas if not collected from the landfill sites, will rise into the atmosphere and will be a major contributor to global warming.\u00a0 The study can include investigating the composition of the rejects from a compost plant, the quantity of methane generated and the impact of the same.\n8. Conclusion\nThe audit has brought out the key issues that need immediate attention and minor lacunas that pose major hindrance in the further process of the system.\u00a0 The waste disposal needs immediate attention and strict monitoring.\u00a0 The setting up sanitary landfill sites has to speed up and this needs to be given top priority.\u00a0 The number of treatment process plants has to be increased to manage total quantity of waste generated.\u00a0 Many new techniques have been implemented for storage, collection, transfer and transportation.\u00a0 These techniques have brought about many positive changes and have increased the efficiency of the MSWM system.\u00a0 However, segregation of waste at each step is not being carried out.\u00a0 The segregation of waste during storage, collection and transportation has to be set in place for the efficient running of the process plants.\u00a0 Proper training and education needs to be provided to the workers and public awareness programs should be conducted regularly.\u00a0 The occupational and health and safety measures taken by the authorities are not sufficient.\u00a0 Health and safety programs has to be conducted regularly to check the health condition of the workers in the various areas of MSWM and they should be educated on the health hazards related to their work and the importance of wearing the safety gear.\n9.

BMW, which accounts for 70\u00a0per cent of municipal waste, is waste, such as food, vegetation and paper, that can be broken down by other living organisms.\nThe EU has set targets for the reduction of BMW sent to landfill because:\nbiodegradable material sent to landfill prevents the recycling of waste and the recovery of energy from waste materials; and\nit can also release emissions: to the air, which may be harmful to the environment and contribute to climate change; and to soil and water, which can be harmful to health.\nEU Member States will be subject to financial penalties if they fail to meet the landfill reduction targets for BMW. The targets for reduction in England are:\nby 2010 to reduce the weight of BMW landfilled to 11.25 million tonnes per annum (75 per cent of BMW landfilled in 1995);\nby 2013 to reduce the weight of BMW landfilled to 7.5 million tonnes per annum (50 per cent of BMW landfilled in 1995); and\nby 2020 to reduce the weight of BMW landfilled to 5.25 million tonnes per annum (35 per cent of BMW landfilled in 1995).\nThe Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (The Department) has a national strategy for waste disposal, which includes plans for meeting the EU Landfill Directive targets in England. Local authorities have statutory responsibility for municipal waste disposal. The Department decided that, to meet the targets, local authorities needed to invest in new waste infrastructure.\nLocal authorities decide the form of procurement for their waste infrastructure projects. Where authorities procure projects under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), central government financial support, known as PFI credits, is available for approved projects. The PFI credit is an undertaking that central government will give annual grants to the value of the PFI credit to help local authorities service the cost of the projects.\nSo far, 18 local authorities have signed PFI contracts with a combined capital value of \u00a31.6 billion. The\u00a0Department has allocated around \u00a3750 million of PFI credits and in the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 it received a further provisional allocation of \u00a32 billion for waste projects.\nPFI contracts are expected to cover around 80\u00a0per\u00a0cent of the waste processed by new infrastructure coming into operation by 2013. Some local authorities, however, use other types of procurement for these projects. These other procurements account for most of the deals expected to close in 2008-09 and 2009-10. The\u00a0non-PFI procurements are mainly small capacity projects but PFI continues to be used for the larger projects.\nA previous National Audit Office report Reducing the Reliance on Landfill in England (HC1177 2005\u201106)examined the Department\u2019s initial response to the EU Directive. In this report we have examined the Department\u2019s management of its PFI waste infrastructure programme. We focus on three criteria:\ni whether a suitable programme of projects with a thriving, competitive supply market has been\u00a0established;\nii whether the projects have been delivered in a timely fashion; and\niii whether the Department has applied appropriate oversight to the projects for which it is providing financial support.\nThis report focuses on PFI projects for which the Department has responsibility through granting PFI credits to local authorities. Many of the issues set out in the report will also be relevant to local authorities taking forward other forms of waste infrastructure procurement. Local Authorities are subject to inspection by the Audit Commission which published in September 2008 Well disposed: Responding to the waste challenge. The Audit Commission\u2019s report focussed on the local authorities\u2019 approach to the problem of BMW being sent to landfill.\nFindings\nManaging the programme\nThe risks faced by waste infrastructure projects are different from those found in other PFIinfrastructure projects. They include: uncertainty over the volume of future waste throughput; planning permission difficulties due to concern by residents about the nature of the facilities being proposed; the risks of different types of waste treatment technology; and finding markets to sell products from waste treatment. PFI projects require interfaces between central and local government and sometimes between neighbouring local authorities. The\u00a0supply side of the market was relatively undeveloped until recently and mainly focussed on waste collection and\u00a0landfill.\nThe Department initially responded too slowly to these challenges.\nThe EU Directive in 1999 created a need for a strategy for significantly increasing diversion of waste away from landfill. Before 2003 the Department\u2019s strategies lacked practical plans for reducing reliance on landfill. Only then did the Department start to address the complex issues involved in building new waste treatment infrastructure. As a result, the market for waste infrastructure projects developed slowly. Only two of the new waste infrastructure projects developed since the EU Directive (1999) have completed construction of all planned assets.\nThe Department has improved its approach to building a market for new waste infrastructure projects. In July 2006, the Department established a delivery unit, the Waste Infrastructure Delivery Programme (WIDP), to accelerate the delivery of waste infrastructure and to provide greater support to local authorities undertaking the projects. WIDP comprises staff from Defra, Partnerships UK and 4ps, who are managed as a single unified team led by the Defra Programme Director. WIDP currently has around 30 staff. The WIDP team has made considerable progress since 2006 in developing the market, including an increasing focus on energy from waste solutions. It has also sought to achieve value for money through agreeing with the market PFI contract terms relevant to waste projects and by improving oversight of the projects.\nThe actions implemented by WIDP have accelerated the rollout of new, larger projects with more contractors interested in bidding for these projects.\nNine new contracts were signed in the two years to March\u00a02008. At the time of our audit, June 2008, the Department had a pipeline of 19 other projects to be advertised in the next three years. The Department has been focusing on larger projects. Projects currently in procurement will, on average, process over twice as much waste as past contracts. The Department has also encouraged local authorities to secure economies of scale by promoting joint projects between neighbouring authorities. There was initially a small number of bidders but the Department\u2019s actions have helped stimulate bids from companies not previously involved, including overseas companies.\nThe cost of finance reflects the risks of waste projects and, in recent times, uncertainties in the financing markets.The risk margin for debt finance is higher for waste PFI projects than other PFI projects such as hospitals or schools. This margin reflects the complex risks of the waste projects. Also, lenders are not yet able to draw confidence from a flow of successful operational projects. In addition, all PFI projects have been facing higher financing costs in 2008 because of the uncertainties in the financial markets. In the longer term, there may be opportunities for the private sector to secure refinancing gains if these risks reduce. The Treasury has introduced a sliding scale whereby the public sector is now entitled to up to 70 per cent of refinancing gains on all PFI contracts signed during the current disruption to the credit markets compared with the previous normal arrangement of\n50 per cent.\nDelivering projects\nThere are long lead times for developing projects and bringing the assets into operation. It takes five\u00a0to nine years to develop projects and bring assets into operation. Delays can occur prior to contract award and in bringing the new facilities into operation. Prior to contract award, PFI projects have been delayed by an average of 19 months compared to the original timetables. Some delays occur because projects need to improve their business cases to gain central government approval. The current difficulties in the financing markets are also delaying large deals. Some projects have, however, been funded by contractors out of existing financial resources giving the prospect of faster deal closure. After contract award, delays have occurred because some projects have encountered difficulty in obtaining planning permission.\nOversight of projects to ensure value for money\nThe Department has improved the oversight and support available to local authorities. The Department, through WIDP, has strengthened its oversight of projects. This action is aimed at reducing delays and achieving better deals. The Department has developed a range of guidance. WIDP is providing practical support by placing experienced commercial staff (known as Transactors) in procurement teams. The Department has also strengthened its quality assurance processes for scrutinising and challenging authorities\u2019 projects.\nThere is now pressure on the fulfilment of the EU landfill targets. The Department\u2019s slow start to programme management and the long timescales needed for bringing these complex projects into operation has created pressure on the EU landfill diversion targets.\nBased on current data:\na it is likely that the 2010 target for landfill reduction will be met.\nb the 2013 target is challenging. It will not be met if there continue to be programme delays or the infrastructure built does not work as efficiently as expected. If the 2013 target is missed the EU is expected to levy fines on the UK, although the EU has yet to announce the rate of such fines. Central government has said that it will levy a fine of \u00a3150\u00a0per tonne if local authorities fail to meet their 2013 landfill targets.\nc It is harder to assess whether the 2020 target will be met. The likelihood of meeting the target will depend on two factors: success of the PFI investment programme; and efforts by local authorities and consumers to produce less waste and recycle more.\nd Achievement of the landfill targets is also dependent on bringing into operation the increasing proportion of projects which local authorities are carrying out under non-PFI procurements. As central government funding support is not given to these projects there is at present no requirement for local authorities to submit information about these to the Department. Without this information the Department\u2019s ability to monitor progress is limited.\nOur value for money conclusion\nThe Department has allocated around \u00a3750 million worth of PFI credits to local authorities undertaking PFI waste infrastructure projects and in the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 it received a further provisional allocation of \u00a32 billion. Achieving value for money from this commitment depends on whether: enough PFI facilities are delivered to meet EU landfill targets; the deals give the prospect of value for money; and the projects are subsequently managed well in operation. The Department was initially slow to address these issues and prior to 2006 few new PFI facilities were delivered. Since 2006, the Department has adopted a programme management approach which has developed the market and achieved a more rapid flow of new and larger PFI contracts. It has strengthened its arrangements for oversight of, and support to, local authorities who enter into waste PFI contracts. England is likely to meet its 2010 landfill reduction targets but to meet the 2013 target the Department will need to reduce substantially the time taken to procure projects and bring them into operation.\nRecommendations\nWe make the following recommendations to help the Department accelerate the successful delivery of waste management PFI projects.\nI The Department is engaged in taking forward a challenging programme of procurements of projects which have complex risks. To help evaluation of the programme and the identification of areas for improvement, the Department should build on its existing management information and develop Key Performance Indicators. The Department should then publish annual performance statistics for the projects which it approves. These statistics should include:\nproject delivery timescales, including separate monitoring of project approval, procurement and construction periods;\nOwnership of contract management policies and strategy\nthe extent of price changes after selection of preferred bidder;\nauthority satisfaction with support received from WIDP; and\nwhether the services in operational projects are being delivered in line with the contract.\nII Local authorities would value greater access to benchmarking information and data that could help them plan procurements effectively. The Department should complete its current work in compiling benchmarked costs of infrastructure for different types of waste project. This information will help local authorities to plan projects and to evaluate bids. The Department should also supplement its existing guidance by collating the following information and making it available to authorities to assist in the development of projects:\nInternal and external resource requirements for different types and size of project including appropriate budgets for the use of external advisers.\nA standard set of assumptions for authorities to use in project plans on key variables such as waste growth. Local authorities may still wish to carry out sensitivity analysis based on alternative assumptions.\nInformation on how to handle the interfaces within the waste management system where waste collection is excluded from the PFI contrac\nIII The financing costs for waste PFI projects are higher than many other types of PFI projects and, like other PFI projects, are affected by the current uncertainties in the financing markets. The Department should:\ncheck that the cost of finance for waste PFI projects can be shown to be reasonable for the risks borne either through a funding competition or\u00a0benchmarking;\nanalyse trends in the differential between the cost of finance for PFI waste projects and other types of PFI project to establish the scale of, and reasons for, the\u00a0difference; and\nset out the assessment local authorities should undertake where a contractor proposes to finance construction through its own resources. This form of financing may avoid delays or price uncertainties in raising project finance in the current financing markets. Authorities should, however, not see faster deal closure as the main reason for choosing a contractor but should weigh this alongside other value for money considerations.\nIV To date the Department\u2019s support to local authorities has mainly focused on project development and procurement. It is now beginning to consider contract management. The Department should increase its oversight of projects after contract award and particularly during the construction phase by:\nbuilding on its existing model of providing experienced individuals to assist with project development and procurement and making sure input is available after contract award if required;\nestablishing minimum standards for resourcing contract management and encouraging local authorities to plan for the handover from procurement to operational contract management;\u00a0and\nincreasing the frequency of monitoring returns from local authorities during the construction phase to at least quarterly, rather than six monthly, from contract award until asset construction is complete and all facilities are operational.\nV Gaining planning permission for new waste treatment facilities is a challenge for local authorities. There is often concern by residents about the nature of the facilities being proposed, resulting in objections which can cause substantial delays to the Department\u2019s programme. The Department should encourage local authorities to consult early with residents to identify issues which residents are likely to raise about different types of technical solution. The Department should complete its planned communications toolkit to assist authorities.\nVI The achievement of the EU landfill targets will be dependent on local authority projects using forms of procurement other than PFI. The Department should obtain sufficient information from local authorities in the form of business cases and progress reports to enable the Department to assess the deliverability of these projects within the forecast timetables. The Department\u2019s oversight disciplines for PFI projects, for example its review of business cases and the involvement of Transactors as a support to project teams, may also be helpful to local authorities using other forms of procurement.\nRelated Reports\n"}, {"score": 816.87317, "uuid": "a567c761-8970-563e-9c34-1ab59a62e8e9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0302wb-49-02766", "target_hostname": "www-tnswep.ra.utk.edu", "target_uri": "http://www-tnswep.ra.utk.edu/solidwaste/solidwaste.html", "page_rank": 1.4030763e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "TNSWEP: Information on Solid <em>Waste</em>", "snippet": "<em>The</em> cause <em>and</em> effect relationship <em>between</em> a bear&#x27;s death <em>and</em> garbage is a very real <em>and</em> one that we <em>are</em> trying to educate visitors about. <em>The</em> bumper sticker is one of a number of tools we <em>are</em> using in that effort.", "explanation": null, "document": "TNSWEP is proud to partner with TP3 Green Schools.

They also explore specific aspects of solid waste management and ways individuals can get involved in their communities.\nOverview on Solid Waste\nThe problem is too much trash\nEach year, Americans generate millions of tons of trash in the form of wrappings, bottles, boxes, cans, grass clippings, furniture, clothing, phone books, and much, much, more. Over the years, we have gotten used to \"throwing it away,\" so it's easy to understand why now there's too much trash and not enough acceptable places to put it.\nIn less than 30 years, durable goods (tires, appliances, furniture) and nondurable goods (paper, certain disposable products, clothing) in the solid waste stream nearly tripled. These now account for about 75 million tons of garbage per year. At the same time, container and packaging waste rose to almost 57 million tons per year, making packaging the number one component of the nation's waste stream. Container and packaging material includes glass, aluminum, plastics, steel and other metals, and paper and paperboard. Yard trimming such as grass clippings and tree limbs are also a substantial part of what we throw away. In addition, many relatively small components of the national solid waste stream, such as household hazardous waste, add up to millions of tons. For example, even 1 percent of the nation's waste stream amounts to almost 2 million tons of trash each year.\n[ Return to Top ]\nIntegrated Solid Waste Management\nIntegrated waste management refers to the complementary use of a variety of practices to safely and effectively handle municipal solid waste. The following is EPA's preferred hierarchy of approaches.\n1. Source reduction is the design, manufacture, purchase, or use of materials (such as products and packaging) to reduce the amount or toxicity of trash generated. Source reduction can help reduce waste disposal and handling costs because it avoids the costs of recycling, municipal composting, landfilling, and combustion. It also conserves resources and reduces pollution.\n2. Recycling is the process by which materials are collected and used as raw materials for new products. There are four steps in recycling: collecting the recyclable components of municipal solid waste, separating materials by type (before or after collection), processing them into reusable forms, and purchasing and using the goods made with reprocessed materials. Recycling prevents potentially useful materials from being landfilled or combusted, thus preserving our capacity for disposal. Recycling often saves energy and natural resources. Composting, a form of recycling, can play a key role in diverting organic wastes from disposal facilities.\n3. Waste combustion and landfilling play a key role in managing waste that cannot be reduced or recycled. Combustion in specially designed facilities reduces the bulk of waste and provides the added benefit of energy recovery. Source reduction and recycling can remove items from the waste stream that may be difficult to burn, cause potentially harmful emissions, or make ash management problematic. Landfilling is--and will continue to be--a major component of waste management. The portion of waste requiring incineration or land disposal can be significantly reduced by examining individual contributions to garbage and by promoting the wise use and reuse of resources.\nSolid Waste\nby Jack Barkenbus, Ph.D., Institute for a Secure and Sustainable Environment, University of Tennessee, Knoxville\nSolid waste management in Tennessee today exemplifies a fairly common pattern surrounding environmental issues in general: namely, when viewed through the lens of past practices, things look pretty good; when viewed through future lenses, however, there is still much that needs to be done. Let's take a look at the good news first. About a decade ago, there were about 100 municipal solid waste landfills scattered throughout the state, most of which did not have modern liners designed to keep contaminated liquids from seeping into groundwater. Management practices at these landfills varied in quality greatly. Today, there are only 42, but this smaller number is compensated for by their larger volume and their federally-mandated liner systems. Many of the smaller, indifferently-managed, public landfills have been closed, and post-closure monitoring requirements are in place. There is a surplus of disposal capacity in Tennessee today that is working to keep disposal costs stable.\nThe picture with regard to collection services is even more dramatic. A decade ago, 29 of Tennessee's 95 counties offered no collection services to its citizens. Another 21 had a green-box system in place that involved siting isolated containers along roadsides. The inadequate green-box system lent itself to vandalism, scavenging and burning. With passage of the Solid Waste Management Act (SWMA) of 1991, county collection was mandated with establishment of a countywide convenience-center system determined to be a minimally-acceptable collection system. Convenience centers, consisting of fenced and attended collection containers to which citizens bring their wastes and recyclables, constitute a marked improvement over green-box systems. Since passage of the SWMA, over 400 attended convenience-centers have been constructed, while isolated green boxes along roadsides are gradually being phased out.\nThe SWMA was landmark legislation. Perhaps most important, it mandated long-term solid waste planning in Tennessee communities with an emphasis upon waste reduction and recycling. Solid waste managers in most communities no longer simply assume that disposal is the preferable option for our waste. Through its funding provisions--namely, a 75-85 cent surcharge on every ton of solid waste disposed of in Tennessee, and a $1 predisposal fee on new tires--the state has been able to mount an impressive collection of activities contributing to more responsible solid waste practices. This includes state sponsorship of household hazardous waste collection events across the state that are very popular; support for the shredding, collection and disposition of used tires; and funding for local communities to purchase waste reduction and recycling equipment. Virtually every Tennessean today has the opportunity to participate in the recycling of consumer goods.\nWhile much has changed for the better, it is still fair to say that a true resource conservation ethic is still in its infancy across Tennessee. It may exist in small pockets of Tennessee but, as a rule, Tennesseans have not bought into a resource stewardship philosophy that permeates their daily life. The SWMA attempted to provide a jump start in this direction by establishing a 25 per cent waste reduction goal to be achieved by December 31, 1995. Did we achieve it? No. State officials say we came close (20 per cent), but even they will admit that the numbers on which the calculations have been based are suspect. A state-established Task Force on Waste Reduction recently advised the state to set a new baseline\u2014the first year when scales were in place at all landfills (1995)\u2014and begin measuring toward the 25 per cent goal again.\nEven with the impressive growth in collection activities, we are only too aware that illegal dumping still exists. Unfortunately, some Tennesseans will continue to show disregard for the environment until legal action is taken against them.\nSome individuals who are very conscientious in their personal lives do not transfer that perspective to their work lives. Exhortations to reduce and recycle need to be directed toward the commercial and industrial sectors where, in fact, the majority of solid waste is generated. State and local officials have been too timid in approaching commercial enterprises with the need to demonstrate good environmental stewardship.\nThere are several effective waste reduction measures being taken in other states, even in some of our neighboring states, that have yet to reach Tennessee. Two come immediately to mind. First, many localities around the country charge for waste services on the basis of waste volumes. In other words, households putting two bins of waste out for collection pay more than households putting only one out. This is really no different than charging citizens for how much electricity or water they use. Citizen stewardship responsibilities should be reinforced through financial incentives, and by differentiating monthly payments on the basis of how much waste is set out to be collected, financial gains and citizenship ethics work in tandem. No Tennessee community has yet opted for this Pay-as-you-Throw system.\nSecond, the majority of Americans live in states that have banned the landfilling of yard waste. The most common components of yard waste--leaves, grass, and tree and brush trimmings--provide no benefit to landfills, but rather take up valuable space. Without considerable technical sophistication these wastes can be converted to material valuable as a soil supplement for enhancing crops, landscaping public and private property, suppressing weed growth and decreasing erosion. Much of Tennessee's agricultural soil is low in organic matter and could benefit from regular doses of organic material derived, in part, from yard waste. Households can learn to create their own composting programs, teaching children basic biological principles while producing a useful gardening product. The same Task Force, mentioned above, also recommended that Tennessee adopt a ban on the landfilling of yard waste, and the issue is currently being deliberated within government circles.\nGiven all of this, is the glass half-full or half-empty? Personally, I think it is half-full, and that over time we will see the glass becoming entirely full. My optimism is, in part, based upon the belief that a wealthier, better-educated, population will come to embrace an ethic of sustainability. I am especially encouraged by the rather extensive educational efforts being made to reach all segments of the population. Funds from the SWMA support the K-12 age grouping through the Tennessee Solid Waste Education Program (TNSWEP). This program targets teachers and, through workshops, exposes them to educational materials and concepts that they can introduce into their classrooms. Counties are also eligible to receive SWMA funding for education with the submission of education action plans. Moreover, the SWMA funds a program that attempts to get the resource conservation message out to the non-school age population.\nResults from these educational efforts are particularly encouraging. Schools across Tennessee are finding young people more than willing to participate in recycling activities, and to take the next step by integrating their efforts within the community. We need to offer as many opportunities as we can to mobilize collective activities that contribute to sustainability. The momentum is moving in the right direction and it will continue to take us where we want to go as long as we foster and support it.\nGarbage Kills Bears!\nby Ken Voorhis and Tom Condon, Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont\nThe bumper stickers on our vehicles often attract attention and questions. \"What do you mean by Garbage Kills Bears ?\" The \"garbage - bear - people\" conflict that has occurred in the Smokies is something many people are well aware of and many have witnessed. The cause and effect relationship between a bear's death and garbage is a very real and one that we are trying to educate visitors about. The bumper sticker is one of a number of tools we are using in that effort. The following is an excerpt from a brochure that was developed by the Great Smoky Mountains Natural History Association to distribute to visitors. It was written by Tom Condon and explains how Garbage Kills Bears.\nProtecting Black Bears in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\nWho Killed Bear #75?\nIn July, 1990, the sheriff of Unicoi County, Tennessee received a report of a dead bear near the rural community of Flag Pond. Responding officials found the corpse of a large male black bear. A tag attached to its ear identified it as #75, a bear first tagged in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A poacher had ended the life of one of the most remarkable bears in recent memory. But who was really responsible for the bear's death?\nThe saga of #75 began two years earlier in Cades Cove, in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where the bear became habituated to people. Its exceptional sense of smell brought it out of its natural world and into ours. The National Park Service first became aware of the bear when it ripped the siding off the John P. Cable Mill to get at the corn meal stored inside. Observation showed that the bear had lost its natural fear of people. It moved through crowds boldly and even climbed into an open car in search of food.\nPark wildlife biologists decided to move the bear. This would be the first of 10 relocations by the Park Service and other wildlife management agencies. Five times #75 would return to Cades Cove, the final time resulting in its 400-mile relocation to Virginia. Bear #75 was returning to the cove when the poacher ended his life. Still, the poacher only finished what someone else had begun. Wildlife officials believe #75 first obtained human-related food from overfilled garbage cans and discarded food scraps while foraging through Cades Cove Campground or Picnic Area at night. Later, someone may have tossed a sandwich to #75 from a car in order to get a better photograph. Or maybe people approached the bear too closely and caused its fear of humans to disappear. However it began, bear #75 became habituated to humans and died as a result.\nThe black bear (Ursus americanus) symbolizes the wilderness qualities of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Its recovery from near extinction in the Smokies to its present population of 1,000 or more is a result of the refuge offered by the park. Yet, in spite of this protection, bears are dying unnecessarily because of the improper disposal of garbage.\nA bear is an opportunist by nature. In the wild it feeds on whatever is readily available. On its way to a ripe berry patch, it may stop to devour a yellow jacket nest or roll over a log to feast on termites and other insects. The bear's remarkable sense of smell also leads it to unnatural foods, such as garbage, which places these animals in immediate danger.\nFood odors and garbage attract bears to campgrounds, picnic areas, residential neighborhoods, businesses, and dump sites. And while the presence of humans will keep most of them away at first (wild bears are naturally afraid of humans and human scent) ultimately the temptation will draw them in, usually at night.\nA night-active bear thus begins a pattern of behavior that all too often ends with its death. The animal loses its fear of humans as it begins to associate human scent with the reward of food. Such a bear will soon become day-active in developed areas, putting it at still greater risk. It may panhandle along roadsides until it is accidentally killed by a car or may injure a visitor and have to be euthanized by park rangers. It may ingest toxic material from garbage and die. Or it may become an easy target for poachers who will shoot a bear for its gall bladder, a valuable commodity on the Asian folk medicine market.\nSince the mid-1960s, the National Park Service has gone to a considerable effort and expense to keep human-related food away from bears. Regulations prohibiting the feeding of bears are strictly enforced. All trash cans in picnic areas and campgrounds now have bear-proof lids and several large bear-proof dumpsters have recently been installed.\nUnfortunately, people do not always take the time to put their trash into these special cans. Food is sometimes left unattended at campsites or cabins. Partially burned trash in fire rings and scraps of uneaten food are left behind. Even bird feed or pet food left outdoors at a cabin or chalet can start problems. Some of these things may seem insignificant, but they initiate behavior patterns which often cannot be reversed. In essence, feeding bears kills bears.\nLet's Talk Trash\nby Pat Carpenter, McDonald School\nWhen I get accused of talking trash in my classroom I have to plead guilty. I have a reputation for having the trashiest students in the school. What's all this garbage that comes out of my mouth? You guessed it. Since this newsletter focuses on garbage, I'm talking about such things as recycling and litter control. If you don't already have your students involved in recycling, there is no time like the present to start. Saving those aluminum cans and turning them in for cash is a great way to earn money for your environmental projects. If your county gets involved with recycling plastics and steel you can get your students involved with this as well. We run recycling contests at school. My TSAP Club members are each assigned to a different classroom where they go a few minutes before the official start of the school day and pick up the recyclables that class has brought in. Newspapers and plastics receive 1 point each. Aluminum cans count as 2 points each. At the end of the contest period, the classroom that has earned the most points wins an ice cream sundae party. This is a way to get the whole school involved with recycling. Since November 15 is America Recycles Day you could base a recycling campaign around this time. This year's focus is on You're not really recycling unless you are buying recycled products. You could give points for students bringing in packaging that showed they had bought recycled products and count this toward the class's total points.\nStudents can get involved in a program called the Nickelodeon Big Help where they pledge a certain number of service hours to community clean-up and other public service projects. Then school ground clean-ups and roadside pick-ups and other things such as this can be done to help the community and stress the importance of picking up that garbage.\nAnother idea is to designate certain trash cans as being for aluminum cans only or plastics only. Then let some of your students draw pictures and write messages on the sides of the trash cans that tell why we should all recycle. There are many good books out that give all kinds of good statistics on the benefits of recycling that you can use. We use permanent magic markers or acrylic paint when we do this.\nThere are many ideas out there for use to get your students thinking trashy thoughts. So go ahead. Be accused of filling your students' heads full of garbage. Today's students are tomorrow's leaders. If we don't teach them who will?\nEcological Footprints and Garbage\nby Rosalyn McKeown, Ph.D., Institute for a Secure and Sustainable Environment, The University of Tennessee\nLately we environmental educators have heard about the \"ecological footprints\" we are leaving on the planet. Industrialized nations are leaving deeper footprints than developing nations.\nOne of the indicators of the impact of our lifestyles on the environment is the amount of garbage we produce. I've heard that we North Americans are less than 10% of the world's population. Yet, we are responsible for over 50% of the world's waste. Those of us living in North America throw away more than any other geographic region in the world. The average person disposes of approximately one ton of garbage per year. The waste we generate personally is only the \"tip of the iceberg\" The manufacturers who produce the goods we consume dispose of far more. I understand that for every ton of trash we generate, manufacturers produce five. Mining and other extractive industries produce 20 tons of waste to our one. That is a lot of waste!\nFortunately, the US Environmental Protection Agency has given us a hierarchy for dealing with our waste. We are to practice: source reduction, reuse, and recycling including composting. As a last resort we are to landfill with methane recovery or incinerate with energy recovery. Many education programs across the state have successfully used the three Rs: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. How do I know that recycling education has been a success in Tennessee? Results from a statewide telephone survey showed that two-thirds of Tennesseans recycle. The percentage goes up to 85 for those who have curbside recycling. The percentage of people who recycle climbed from 40% in the late eighties to the current 66%. These high figures indicate to me that we have done a good job of recycling education. Perhaps, we should consider putting recycling education in a maintenance mode and concentrate more on consumer education to reduce the amount of garbage we dispose of.\nTennessee is doing rather well in managing garbage compared to some of our neighboring states. The Tennessee Solid Waste Management Act (TSWMA) forced counties or groups of counties to create a solid waste management plan and develop the infrastructure to deal with the growing garbage problem. The TSWMA also called for the education of all Tennessee citizens with respect to integrated solid waste management. Fortunately, the legislature had foresight and included a provision for funding the educational mandate. Oversight for the TSWMA was given to the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. They have instituted several education programs. For example, education for K - 12 teachers and students is carried out through the TNSWEP program at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville (UTK).\nIt strikes me as rather odd that the countries with the highest levels of education also produce the most garbage and leave the deepest ecological footprints. It is obvious that more education is not the answer to global sustainability. The content, skills, attitudes, and perceptions of that education are essential. So once again we environmental educators are challenged to be thoughtful in our process of educating ourselves and the next generation.\n"}], [{"score": 806.292, "uuid": "c57da224-77ef-5528-9173-6b5671091f91", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1507wb-16-01816", "target_hostname": "aquaponicsglobal.com", "target_uri": "http://aquaponicsglobal.com/tag/fish-waste/", "page_rank": 1.3139689e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Fish <em>Waste</em> | Aquaponics Global", "snippet": "However, it is a <em>biodegradable</em> medium <em>and</em> rots down. As such, it can cause clogging of pipes <em>and</em> pumps as it becomes mobile in <em>the</em> water stream. ", "explanation": null, "document": "3\nWhen considering aquaponic grow bed construction, there are basically two ways to go:\nAquaponic shallow raceways filled with water from the fish tanks, and no growing media. These use floating rafts to support the plants.\u00a0 This deep water culture floating raft method is what is commonly used in large commercial aquaponics systems. Your plant roots here are suspended in fish waste water alone.\nAquaponic shallow raceways filled with growing media. These are commonly used in backyard and hobby systems, where clogging of the pipes can be fixed on a small scale with few problems. The growing media are inert, chemically stable, and pH neutral. They are\u00a0 not like soil, in that growing media are sterile when put in the raceways. There are no pests in the growing media to snack on your plant roots. They contain no humus or bioactive constituents, and can be one of the following materials:\nGrowing Media.\nRockwool. One meter long rockwool slabs are available. These usually come wrapped in a white plastic cover. Before introducing the 3 or 4 inch rockwool propagation blocks into them, the base of the white covering must be slit to allow water to flow through the block, and a hole cut in the top for the base of the block to sit on.\u00a0 To use these, you simply site them in the long hydroponic gullies sold for this purpose, and cover the tops of the blocks in PVC to stop algae build-up. Make sure the fish water you are using for this is properly filtered of all fish poo particles, or these rockwool slabs will eventually clog up, and need extensive high pressure rinsing to get clean. Using rockwool for grow beds is very expensive, and like other growing media, they clog up very easily.\nPerlite/Vermiculite. Perlite is a soft sterile white inert growing medium.\u00a0 It is very light and has high water retention properties.\u00a0 It is chemically stable, drains well, absorbs water, but does not allow great permeability of minerals, which is an advantage. This is the best medium for filling grow beds intended to grow root vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, and celery. Perlite can also be sterilised and re-used after harvest.\u00a0 Beware, however, of the fine dust that comes in bags of perlite.\u00a0 If you breathe it in, it will irritate your throat and lungs.\u00a0 A proper industrial face filter mask is in order here. To be on the safe side, run a hose through the bag and rinse out the contents before you start digging around in the growing media.\u00a0 This will wash out most of the dust, and settle the rest. Vermiculite has first-class properties as a growing medium, with high water absorbtion capacity and a reasonably high cation exchange capacity (CEC). This simply means it has the ability to hold nutrients and release at a later stage.\u00a0 When mixed with perlite it provides a very good all-round growing medium.\nExpanded clay balls, (usually Hydroton or Hydroleca brands).\u00a0 These balls are produced by baking clay in a revolving kiln, producing balls of between 4 and 12 millimetres in size. The shape of the balls allows for good drainage, and space for air to reach the plant roots. The pitted surface of the balls provides an ideal home for nitrifying bacteria, which transform dissolved ammonia from the fish into plant food.\u00a0 Like perlite, they can be sterilised and used repeatedly.\u00a0 As with perlite, ensure that the new clay balls are washed thoroughly.\u00a0 This will prevent clay dust from getting in your eyes and throat and causing health problems.\u00a0 I usually get the hose and slit the top and bottom of the bag and wash the whole lot through for ten minutes or so until the water emerging at the bottom runs clear. As a growing medium the balls are usually used to fill a grow bed or raceway and then rockwool or other medium seed plugs with seedlings in, are pushed into them.\nCoir (coconut fiber).\u00a0 This is very moisture retentive, but contains no available nutrients. Will Allen of Growing Power uses this extensively in his famous aquaponic system, where he grows a million pounds in weight of food a year on only three acres in downtown Milwaukee.\u00a0 However, it is a biodegradable medium and rots down.\u00a0 As such, it can cause clogging of pipes and pumps as it becomes mobile in the water stream.\u00a0 Extreme vigilance is advised when using this as a growing medium, and extra filter sieves should be put at the exits of all raceways, grow beds, etc., and regularly checked and cleaned.\nSand. This was one of the first growing media tried for aquaponic grow beds.\u00a0 However, it does tend to get everywhere, and get into pumps and filters. Very heavy, which is a disadvantage if you want to put your grow beds on raised tables or shelving.\nPumice. Similar to volcanic scoria, below.\u00a0 Watch out for pumice dust!\u00a0 A breathing mask is in order here when unpacking it from the bags. Use the rinsing methods as for perlite and expanded clay balls. A very lightweight aquaponic growing medium, make sure your grow beds are not exposed to wind, this stuff can easily blow away.\nVolcanic scoria (volcanic gravel). Like expanded clay balls, volcanic scoria is lightweight, and full of little air bubbles. It is an aerolite as such. As a growing medium, it has similar properties to expanded clay balls, in that its rough surfaces provide an ideal home for nitrifying bacteria, and it drains well, allowing plenty of spaces for air to circulate past the plant roots. In addition, it is a very efficient insulator, and can protect the plant roots of your plants from extremes of temperature, provided you have calculated adequate depth of the grow bed to allow for this possibility. A three foot deep grow bed (1 metre) can help protect the plant roots from extremes of heat and cold. However, these should really not occur in the vicinity of your aquaponic system, since what is above ground will still suffer. A very inexpensive option for filling your grow beds.\u00a0 But if you do not want extremes of temperature to affect your crops, get a greenhouse!\nGrow Bed Construction:\nThe main thing to keep in mind when constructing grow beds is that they should be at least 12 inches deep, to allow for sufficient biological activity in the growing media. Four feet wide is good, since you can reach everything across four feet for maintenance, planting and harvesting.\u00a0 Grow beds should also be in proportion in volume to the volume of your fish tanks.\u00a0 So if you have 250 gallons of fish tanks, you should have at least 250 gallons of grow beds.\u00a0 In fact, you can go as high as 500 gallons of grow beds to your 250 gallons of fish tanks, as long as you are stocking your fish tanks fairly intensively, and have densely planted plants at some stage of growth in all your grow beds for that volume.\u00a0 This is becaus you need the plant roots to take up the nitrates from the water and clean it for the fish.\nRemember that in a backyard aquaponics system, the grow beds are the biofilter for the fish tanks.\u00a0 Without adequate biofiltration of fish solids and the toxins they contain, your fish will sicken and die quite rapidly. Maintenance of your growing media involves daily inspections to make sure that they are still permeable to water, and that the pipework is still clear and not leaking anywhere.\u00a0 Also check all the standpipes in the grow beds and tanks are properly seated and clear of obstructions and gunge.\u00a0 Water should only come to a couple of inches below the actual surface of the growing media.\u00a0 This is to discourage algae from growing on the surface of your grow beds.\u00a0 An aquaponic growbed should not have any algae visible on the surface. Algae can soak up oxygen needed by plant roots and clog up the media for you royally.\nYou also have to make sure that your water flow is going around at around 3000 liters an hour. This is to make sure that for the above volumes, the plant roots are getting adequate air and nutrients at all times.\u00a0 Keep checking your pump to make sure that it is not clogged with growing media dust and gunge.\u00a0 Basically, you are reproducing the conditions in a riverine ecosystem, where plant roots penetrate gravel full of flowing water at the river\u2019s edge.\nWhen constructing grow beds, therefore, make sure you pipe diameters are at least 3 inches, to allow for this continuous flow. DO NOT USE THE SAME PIPE DIAMETERS AS FOR HYDROPONICS. Aquaponics is not quite hydroponics, the oxygen and flow requirements are much greater, and wider pipes have less tendency to clog with escaped gunge from the fish, should this occur.\nThee are all sorts of large 12 inch deep plastic tanks on the market that make suitable containers for grow beds.\u00a0 One of my old tutors used plastic dog baths as his basic tanks!\u00a0 You can also make frameworks out of cedar or other non-decomposing materials and line them with LDPE pond liner to form the raceways that you then fill with expanded clay balls, vermiculite, volcanic scoria, etc.\u00a0 Media based aquaponics systems use the media to support the plant roots in the water and keep the green parts of plants in the sunlight.\nMedia based aquaponics is really only for the smaller scale systems, however, because all the evidence suggests that media based aquaponic systems are much more susceptible to the scourge of clogging.\u00a0 The addition of composting worms to your growing media, when the aquaponic systems are up and running, will help to discourage this, however, since composting worms love to eat the gunge and plant detritus that so loves to get into your pipework and stop the water circulating. Plant roots rot in stagnant water!\nAs mentioned above, for large seriously commercial systems, the way to go is not with media based aquaponics at all, but with simple raceways for the flowing water, at least two feet deep.\u00a0 Oxygen is supplied through flexible vinyl pipes equipped with air lines and airstones every three feet or so along the raceway bottoms. These water-filled raceways support floating rafts which are made of closed cell polystyrene which has been painted with a white non-toxic roof paint such as Cool Cote.\u00a0 Holes at the appropriate plant spacing distances (5 by 6 inches for lettuce, for instance) are drilled in these rafts, and small plastic net pots inserted.\u00a0 The plant plugs containing the seedlings are inserted into these net pots when ready and left on the floating raft to mature until harvest time some 29 days later, for each raft planted.\nThese floating raft systems are not strictly speaking grow beds, but aquaponic systems raceways.\u00a0 Floating raft systems, filled only with water, are much easier to maintain and clean, do not clog up with fish waste, and have greater biofilter properties than the growing media in the long term. As far as construction goes, the retaining walls of these raceways can be made of a variety of materials, including fence posts and heavy duty welded fence wire mesh, concrete berms, and planks supported by fence posts.\u00a0 The interior is lined with LDPE pond liner which is cemented down with aquarium sealant and allowed to overlap the sides, where it is secured with glue.\u00a0 The floating rafts are cut to the exact 4 foot interior width of the raceways, and should cover the entire surface, in order to limit water evaporation and take advantage of the growing space to the maximum.\nAquaponic systems also have, of course, the fish tank and piping element, not to mention pumps and air blowers. These all connect up to the grow beds and/or floating raft systems of your aquaponic systems. To get into the finer detail of grow bed construction and maintenance, for which there is no space here, I recommend a couple of reasonably priced and deeply fascinating expert books on aquaponics systems construction, see below:\n"}, {"score": 805.4746, "uuid": "3c6a3579-beac-5a6f-9376-53239b4d4638", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1101wb-94-05751", "target_hostname": "www.catmom.com", "target_uri": "http://www.catmom.com/articles/environ.html", "page_rank": 1.2593546e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Making a <em>Difference</em>: Helping Yourself <em>and</em> Your Environment", "snippet": "Create a habit of placing <em>the</em> bags near <em>the</em> door that leads to your car after emptying <em>the</em> bags in <em>the</em> kitchen, so you take them back to your car where they <em>are</em> ready to use again. <em>What</em> is <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> <em>the</em> terms reduce, reuse, <em>and</em> recycle?", "explanation": null, "document": "Making a Difference: Helping Yourself and Your Environment\nby Marina Michaels\nThis Web page presents some ways I have found to both simplify my life and help the environment at the same time. Most of the quoted statistics, with the exception of the ones I computed myself (as in the urban horror story example), are from 50 Simple Things You Can Do To Save The Earth, from The Earthworks Group in Berkeley, California, USA (1989). (This book is now out of print, but there is a newer business version still in print that is just as useful: 50 Simple Things Your Business Can Do to Save the Earth .)\nTable of Contents\nBuy cloth shopping bags and use them at least once a month.\nRecycle everything you possibly can, and \"precycle\" too.\nConserve with toiletries , reducing waste and using environmentally-friendly products.\nCompost household and yard wastes.\nBuy organic products only, or increase the amount of organic products you buy.\nConserve energy in various ways.\nPreamble\nWhen I first saw a clearcut US national forest, I felt as though I had happened upon a war zone. There was nothing left for any wildlife to live on, in, or under, and the natural beauty of the forest was gone forever, to be replaced by regimented rows of \"plantation\"-like trees, all the same age and same species.\nWhile forestry management has advanced somewhat since those days, it is my opinion that the US Forest Service is mainly there to serve the needs of the paper companies, rather than those of people who would like to see an old-growth forest. I understand that it \"only\" takes 300 years or so for a forest to be considered an old-growth forest, but most people don't happen to have those 300 years to spare waiting around to see one. But even if they did, with the current forestry practices of today, there is no guarantee that they ever would be able to see one.\nBut although it was tempting to blame the paper companies and the US Forest service for what I consider a criminal devastation of our national forests, I couldn't in all conscience lay the blame solely at their feet. In any society, the laws of supply and demand hold: If there is a demand, someone will supply it. In this case, the US population demands paper products, and the US Forest Service and the paper and lumber companies supply them, at the cost of many priceless national forests.\nTherefore, to reduce the demand for those trees as something other than trees, I realized that the first thing I could do would be to reduce my demand for tree by-products. In particular, paper. When I went home and looked around, I saw a number of areas right away where I was carelessly and thoughtlessly using up precious national forests: paper napkins , paper towels , and paper plates being three big items.\nCan any single person really make a difference?\nYou might be wondering whether one person making a change can make a difference. I wondered that too, but I felt I had to start somewhere, and starting with my own habits seemed the best and easiest place. If I couldn't do it, I certainly couldn't urge anyone else too; on the other hand, if I found it easy, then others might also. There is of course much documentation for one person making a difference, so I won't go into what has been so well covered elsewhere. But for an example, here's a quote from a Seventh Generation Company's toilet tissue package (Seventh Generation is one of the many companies that provide products for those who are interested in having a healthy planet):\n\"If every household in the U.S. replaced just one roll of 500 sheet virgin fiber bathroom tissues with 100% recycled ones, we could save:\n297,000 trees\n1.2 million cubic fee of landfill space, equal to 1,400 full garbage trucks\n122 million gallons of water, a year's supply for 3,500 families of four\"\nIf we apply this same kind of math to the many other changes we could make, we can achieve a tremendous improvement in the environment in just a short amount of time.\nDon't think you have to completely save the world or recycle every last scrap of material. That path leads to eventual frustration and failure. Instead, give yourself credit every time you recycle anything, and don't worry if you aren't being perfect about it. I have seen too many people fall into the trap of, \"If I can't do it perfectly, I won't do it at all.\" The belief behind that thought is that nothing less than perfection is acceptable. Well, erase that thought right now and replace it with this one:\nEven one change makes a difference!\nPerfection is a process, not an end point.\nBack to top\nAn urban horror story\nHere's a (true!) urban horror story: I know of a family of four with a single pet that uses paper plates, paper napkins, paper towels, and so on every day. They use \"real\" plates only on special occasions. The only recycling that gets done in their house is by their housekeeper, who takes cans home to recycle. Every week, this family, even though they use a trash compactor on all their trash, produces three 90-gallon cans filled to overflowing with garbage. Every week. That's 4,680 gallons of compacted garbage a year. That doesn't include their yard waste.\nNow contrast that with my home\u2014a family of three, with numerous pets. We use neither paper plates nor paper napkins, and we use paper towels only with great reluctance. We do not own a trash compactor. We recycle newsprint, junk mail, catalogs, magazines, cardboard, metal, plastic, milk and other drink containers, and so on. We also do not subscribe to any newspapers (500,000 trees are consumed every Sunday) and very few magazines (most of which, like Cricket, a children's magazine, we keep; the rest of which we reuse or recycle). We usually fill a single 60-gallon trash can a month. That's 720 gallons of uncompacted garbage a year.\nIf the other family were to make two changes: switch to using real plates, and switch to using real napkins, I am convinced that they could easily reduce their trash by at least one entire 90-gallon can a week.\nTake a look around your home and see where you can start making changes. It doesn't have to be a huge change. It can even be one change. It will make a difference! Buy recycled-paper toilet paper, for example, or indulge in a nice set of cloth napkins\u2014then use them every day.\nBack to top\nInternet Activism\nIn addition to the activities listed on this page, you can make your opinion heard and join with other like-minded people by signing petitions on the Internet. Here is a sampling of some of the best sites.\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council provides information on many current environmental concerns. I am particularly active with their BioGems program . You can be too. And it is free, though of course you can also join and help them further that way.\nThe BioGems Web site makes it easy to send email letters concerning a number of environmentally sensitive \"gems.\" It keeps track of your actions so you can see how much you have already done, and to see what remains to be done, without having to remember which specific actions you've already taken.\nThe Sierra Club\nThe Sierra Club was created in 1892 by John Muir. Sign a Sierra Club petition .\nThe Environmental Organization Web Directory\nBack to top\nThe \"healthy planet\" lists\nIn this section I provide some ways in which you can help create a healthier planet through direct, personal actions. If you use even one of these suggestions, you can congratulate yourself on making what will add up to a huge difference over your lifetime. If you make two changes from this list, you can figure you are making a difference over two lifetimes. And so on.\nThe following require very little commitment, yet greatly benefit both you and the environment:\nHelp save trees and help reduce manufacturing costs by using recycled paper products.\nHelp the environment and help conserve resources by finding and using a few all-purpose cleaners instead of using high-impact, single-purpose cleaning products. (Often, single-purpose cleaners are petroleum-based, which means they are consuming oil resources.)\nHelp the environment by conserving energy in various ways.\nYou might have noticed that most of the suggestions here focus on saving paper, which translates into saving trees. I consider these to be the easiest ways to start or improve upon a \"green\" focus. For one thing, there are many alternatives\u2014very nice alternatives\u2014to paper for just about every paper product you might be using. For another, saving trees has so many benefits that it would be hard to list them all. Here are a few:\nThe air we breathe is cleaner if we have more trees.\nThe beauty of our natural forests\u2014what's left of them\u2014is preserved for us to enjoy for many different kinds of outdoor activities: river rafting and kayaking, camping, fishing, hunting, retreats, birding, hiking, backpacking, and so on.\nWhen we greatly reduce the need for wood by not buying paper we don't need, the cost of paper items we do need is reduced. Likewise, the cost of lumber for housing is greatly reduced.\nMaking paper consumes resources and pollutes the air and water. And throwing it away fills the waste stream.\nBack to top\nUse cloth napkins\nThe first and easiest decision I made was to never, ever, ever buy paper napkins again. When I used up the last of my paper napkins, I went out and purchased a set of eight large cloth napkins, which I then used for all occasions, from picnics to elegant dinners. I have since acquired several more sets in festive colors, simply because I enjoy having a variety. I only recently retired that original set of eight, which I purchased in 1978 (I donated them to a charitable organization). They were still quite serviceable.\nThere are many benefits to be derived from purchasing cloth napkins:\nThey \"dress up\" any occasion, making even the simplest meals seem a little more elegant, fun, and interesting.\nThey add only a negligible amount of work, in that you need to wash, fold, and put them away, but, being small, they are hardly noticeable as an added task. Certainly, it takes far more time to go to the store to buy paper napkins (multiplied by all the times you need to go to the store) than it does to take care of cloth napkins.\nThey are far more comfortable to use than paper.\nThe cost savings is considerable if you compare how much you would spend on paper napkins versus cloth napkins over the life of the cloth napkins. If one set of cloth napkins can last nearly 20 years without noticeable wear, then purchasing cloth napkins is a lifetime investment. Figure the cost of paper napkins over a lifetime, subtract the cost of purchasing and maintaining cloth napkins, and you have the savings.\nBack to top\nUse cloth towels\nIf you find you are using paper towels every day or even once a week, that's too much. Switch to cloth kitchen towels. Paper towels have some limited utility when using them to clean up messes that would be too hard to remove from cloth (such as car engine oil). Otherwise, cloth kitchen towels have many of the same advantages as cloth napkins, though their life, being harder, is less long.\nBack to top\nUse real plates\nPaper plates don't belong at home. Even on picnics or camping, you can find a more durable alternative, such as enameled plates. And think of how much more pleasant it is to eat from real plates.\nBack to top\nUse recycled paper products\nRecycled paper products are available for just about every purpose you use virgin paper products for. As much as possible, purchase only recycled paper products. Here's a sampling of items you can replace with recycled versions:\nstationery, including business stationery\nBack to top\nUse a few all-purpose cleaners\nI used to buy into the idea that I needed a different cleaner for every cleaning task. Some years ago, after I gave birth my daughter (as a single parent), I realized I need to simplify my life as much as possible in as many ways as possible so I could have the most time possible for my daughter.\nThe first discovery I made was that I didn't have to clean house quite as often. The next discovery was that I could make a few cleaning products do the job of many. Rather than have one cleaner for the carpet, another for kitchen surfaces, yet another for bathroom surfaces, a fourth for windows and mirrors, a fifth for floors, a sixth for laundry, and so on, I was able to find a few cleaners that were good for a wide range of chores\u2014and I mean good, as in they work every bit as well as, or, in many cases, better than, the special-purpose cleaners I had been using before. Plus, they are much more environmentally friendly, and can even save energy!\nHere's a list of the cleaning products I have found useful:\nIn the kitchen: Dishwashing liquid and dishwasher detergent. Buy the natural stuff if you can\u2014it generally works just as well and is easier on the environment. I find that the Seventh Generation Company's dishwasher powder works GREAT! Or try Trader Joe's environmentally friendly version, which also works great and is very inexpensive.\nThe Seventh Generation people say \"If every household in the U.S. replaced just one bottle of 28-oz. petroleum-based dishwashing liquid with our vegetable-based product, we could save 82,000 barrels of oil, enough to drive a car for over 86 million miles.\"\nOh, and by the way\u2014if you have been virtuously washing dishes by hand in the mistaken notion that you are saving water over using a dishwasher, rejoice, for you need wash dishes by hand no more. Full dishwashers use far less water than washing the same amount of dishes by hand does. So give yourself and the environment a break, load up that dishwasher, and go read a good book. Or surf the Net.\nIn the kitchen and bathrooms: Bon Ami cleanser, which has no chlorine or unnatural ingredients. I use Bon Ami for all scrubbing chores that you might use Comet and SoftScrub-type cleansers for. Bon Ami can even be used on no-scratch surfaces like your bathroom or kitchen sink and on Corningware. Most people aren't aware that the regular scouring cleansers like Comet put tiny scratches in your kitchen sink, which then collect more dirt and stains, making it necessary to clean even harder the next time. Baking soda makes a great alternative to Bon Ami. (Baking soda is great in the kitchen too, especially for coffee and tea stains.)\nIn the laundry: Bi-O-Kleen's All-Temperature Liquid Laundry Detergent . This grapefruit-seed-based product is FABULOUS! I only need to use a tablespoon for even the largest loads. It biodegrades into oxygen and water in 24 hours, and contains no harmful ingredients. Plus, it rinses completely clean, leaving no residues (unlike regular laundry detergents). You'll be amazed at how soft your clothing will become, without needing \"softeners.\" Plus, your towels will dry you off faster and better. Fabric \"softeners\" make your towels LESS absorbent, and otherwise serve no useful purpose aside from parting you from your money. You do the math.\nBi-O-Kleen offers a \"whitener\" laundry powder as well, which works pretty well, though I find that the regular Bi-O-Kleen liquid scrubs my clothing quite clean. However, for the really tough stains, try OxiClean .\nIf these products don't get your clothes clean, nothing will. OxiClean is also a great all-round cleaner/stain remover, including for carpets.\nDon't bother with the so-called \"dryer sheets.\" They do not soften fabric, but only work on static. And if your clothes are all made from natural fabrics, you won't have a problem with static.\nOne good natural soap for the body. I have found a handmade vegetable-oil-based soap (in my local organic market) that I can even use on my face without bad effects (and my skin is quite sensitive). The entire family uses it.\nOne good shampoo and conditioner. We like the Avalon Organic Botanical shampoos and conditioners made by Avalon Natural Products . My favorite is their Mint Thyme Organic shampoo.\nEverywhere: Either use OxiClean (mentioned above) or JobMaster all-purpose cleaner. JobMaster is biodegradable and nontoxic, and works great on just about everything, including stoves and carpets. It works moderately well on mirrors and windows, though I recommend vinegar for a truly sparkling clean on those surfaces (or better yet, use one of the new microfiber cleaning cloths with plain water). JobMaster is matched by no other cleaner when it comes to cleaning dirty stoves without struggle.\nThat's it. Inexpensive, easy, effective, safe.\nAbout washing diapers\nIf you have a baby and you are using cloth diapers , find and use the safest, gentlest, most biodegradable laundry detergent for your baby's diapers. And stick with it. I had the following horrible experience which I hope will help prevent others from making the same mistake:\nBefore I discovered Bi-O-Kleen , I used Shaklee laundry detergent for years. When my daughter was born, naturally I used it on her diapers as well. It worked fine.\nThen I read in some misguided magazine article that it was a \"good idea\" to switch around on the laundry detergents you use for your cloth diapers; that \"build ups\" would otherwise take place, and switching detergents would solve the problem. So I switched to Fresh Start laundry detergent.\nMy daughter (who was about 4 months old at the time) instantly developed a blistered bottom that was so bad that it looked burned. I had to let her lay out bare-bottomed while she healed. Meanwhile, I washed and rinsed those diapers in fresh water only (in my laundry machine) eight times, and even still, after eight full washings, they still burned my daughter's bottom. So I set them aside and purchased an entire new set of diapers. (Much later, I learned that washing the diapers with vinegar added to the wash water would dissolve out the offending materials.)\nThis taught me a lesson: Whatever was in Fresh Start, if it was strong enough to burn a baby's bottom after eight washings of the material with fresh water only, then it couldn't be good for anyone. It also taught me to stick with Shaklee until my daughter was out of diapers. (I now use Bi-O-Kleen.)\nBack to top\nUse cloth diapers\nIn 1989, over 1 billion trees were used every year to make disposable diapers. That's 1,000,000,000 trees a year. Now, with the introduction of paper training pants, I am sure that number is higher.\nI don't normally take hardline stances, but it is my opinion that diapers and the newer invention, paper training pants, should be outlawed, because it seems obvious that people find it very hard to withdraw from their addiction to them. Still, being an optimist and assuming that you are a thinking person who can make a rational decision here in favor of life and survival, I make this plea: Switch to cloth diapers. If you must, use paper diapers while traveling or at your child's daycare (though do your best to talk them into letting you use cloth), but use cloth diapers and cloth training pants at home.\nArguments in favor of cloth diapers:\nThey are much more comfortable for your baby. Imagine if you had to wear paper next to your rear, day in and day out, for over two years.\nAn infant needs to be changed 10 to 12 times a day. (Take heart, new parents: this goes down as your infant grows older.) If you are using paper diapers, you will often be unaware of your infant's need for a fresh diaper, and so that moisture or other material sits next to your baby's tender bottom for hours. I had a neighbor (using paper diapers) who told me her infant son only needed to be changed four times a day. I shudder to think of how uncomfortable that poor little guy was. If you look at the advertisements for paper diapers, you'll notice that what they are selling is an illusion of dryness, as opposed to the true dryness your lucky baby will enjoy with cloth diapers.\nYour baby's health will be better. When wetness sits around, bacteria starts to grow. I had friends who told me that their two infant daughters had constant yeast and bladder infections until they figured out that the problem was the paper diapers. When they switched over to cloth diapers, the infections went away.\nYou'll be saving trees.\nYou won't be contributing to an enormous landfill and health problem.\nOver their useful life, cloth diapers cost much less than paper diapers. One woman I knew who switched to cloth said she had an instant US$50 in her grocery budget every month. That was back in 1986. It would certainly be much more now.\nRemember, if you can't stand the thought of washing diapers, or your life circumstances make it prohibitive to do so, you can use a diaper service. Diaper services, last I checked, cost about as much as or even a little less than paper diapers. They pick them up, wash them, and deliver fresh, dry, clean diapers to your door. Diaper service makes a great baby shower gift, too.\nBack to top\nFor women only: Use cloth for your monthly needs\nI haven't purchased anything for my monthly needs since 1978. Instead, I asked my mother what women used to do in her day, and modified that to suit my preferences.\nHere's what my mother told me she did: In her day, there weren't such things as tampons or sanitary napkins. Instead, she and her sister would take gauze and make pads for themselves. They would throw out the gauze after one use.\nI liked the idea of using cloth\u2014my skin is quite sensitive, and the paper pads chafe horribly\u2014so I purchased some good-quality red flannel and cut it into a number of large rectangles, which I then just folded to a desired thickness. (You'll have to experiment with size\u2014there's a balance between bulk and usefulness.)\nThe first time I used them, I couldn't believe how much more comfortable I was. No more chafing, and the flannel was as absorbent as, or even more absorbent than the paper pads I was replacing. The cloth conforms more securely and comfortably to my body, and can be washed and reused for many years. I found I didn't need anything to hold the cloth in place.\nWhen I am away from home, I carry two Ziploc bags\u2014one for fresh cloths, and one for used cloths. If I need to change while away, I rinse the used cloth in sink of whatever bathroom I am in and put it in the Ziploc bag until I can get back home to put it in the laundry. If I am traveling for longer periods of time (no pun intended), I wash and dry the used cloths.\nThe bonuses to this method are many:\nThe savings are considerable. Tampons and paper pads are expensive! When I started this, I was paying US$6 to US$12 a month for paper pads, or US$78 US$156 per year. I purchased two yards of red flannel for US$1.50 yard (US$3.00 total), and am still using that same flannel. My minimum savings over ten years (not counting increases in the price of the paper pads): US$777.\nThis method is far healthier. Remember toxic shock syndrome?\nOf course, it contributes to the environment in many ways, including reducing the use of paper, bleaches, and manufacturing processes.\nI find it far more convenient to reach in a drawer and pull out the fresh cloths when I need them, instead of having to rush to the store if caught unaware.\nI like being more in touch with and more involved with handling my own womanly processes.\nIt is far more comfortable. If you have always used paper, you might not understand how much more comfortable cloth can be. Take my word for it: You may never use paper again! (The only exception being when you are away from home when you start to surf the crimson wave.)\nBack to top\nBuy cloth shopping bags and use them (or reuse your paper or plastic bags)\nIf every American shopper used a cloth bag (or took one less paper or plastic bag from the store) just once a month, we'd save hundreds of millions of bags a year.\nUsing cloth shopping bags is fun and convenient. They are sturdier, too, so they hold more. And some stores now pay five cents for each bag you use (including reusing paper or plastic). Create a habit of placing the bags near the door that leads to your car after emptying the bags in the kitchen, so you take them back to your car where they are ready to use again.\nRemember to recycle your paper or plastic bags!\nReduce, reuse, recycle\nWhat is the difference between the terms reduce, reuse, and recycle?\nReducing, also known as precycling, is purchasing products with an eye to how much (or how little) packaging they have. For example, you can purchase items in bulk (even if you buy just a small amount) instead of purchasing them in individual packages. (You can buy as much or as little as you like at a time, so don't be put off by the term \"bulk.\") Reducing reduces the amount of waste that goes into the waste stream, and helps save resources in a number of other ways as well. Here are some suggestions for reducing waste (they include bothr educing and reusing); more ways are mentioned elsewhere on this page (such as buying cloth napkins and cloth grocery bags).\nBuy oatmeal, flour, sugar, and other staples in bulk and store them in attractive ceramic or glass containers.\nWhen you run out of a spice, such as cayenne, buy a few ounces at your local health food store and refill the empty container.\nBuy oil, honey, and even soaps and lotions in bulk; Take in and refill your own (clean!) containers.\nTake advantage of those peanut-butter-making machines at your grocery or health food store. Take in your own (clean!) containers.\nReusing is just that\u2014reusing a product or container instead of throwing it away or buying a new one. For example, you can reuse grocery shopping bags, or reuse glass jars for storage containers. Be imaginative!\nRecycling is returning materials for reuse, such as paper products, glass, plastics, and so on. Recycling materials helps reduce resources and keeps those recycled materials out of the waste stream.\nThe ultimate goal is to contribute absolutely nothing back into the waste stream, and to reduce your consumption of products, reuse products as much as possible, and recycle what's left. Reaching the ultimate goal is doable, though it takes a lot of work. But don't stress if you aren't even close. Remember, every effort makes a positive difference! Just try to reduce, reuse, and recycle as much as you can, and you will still be doing a great deal of good for yourself and the environment.\nMake it easier for yourself by designating containers for the different kinds of things you recycle, and by placing them near where those materials are generated. For example, in our household, the recycling bins are in the kitchen, where I can place cans, plastic, paper, and bottle. In my office, I have two attractive rattan baskets: One for recyclable paper, and the other for confidential materials. The bulk of our unsolicited mail goes, unopened, into either the paper recycling bin in the kitchen or into the paper recycling basket in my office. (I burn the confidential materials.) I use a duplex printer, for which I buy only recycled paper, and I recycle or burn printouts. Cardboard we store on our porch until there is enough to flatten and recycle\u2014though we reuse most good cardboard boxes (for storage or items we are donating).\nReusing and recycling applies to computers as well. When I upgrade my computer, if I don't know someone personally who can benefit from the older equipment, I donate the old equipment to a service called Micro Ministries (in the San Francisco East Bay area), which refurbishes old computers and gets them into the hands of those who might not otherwise have access to a computer. Hewlett-Packard and other large manufacturers recycle computer components. Computers in the waste stream are becoming a larger environmental problem. Ask around and see if you can pass your old equipment on or get it recycled.\nBack to top\nReduce waste in the bathroom\nUse Eco-Dent \"GentleFloss,\" which uses no plastic in its packaging. According to them, \"As many as 700 million plastic floss containers are discarded every year. As much as 9 million pounds of non-renewable, non-recylced floss containers\u2014not to mention wasteful secondary packaging, like boxes and blister cards\u2014end up in our already over-crowded landfills each year. Only Eco-dent offers you an alternative to this incredible packaging waste!\"\nPlus, it is excellent dental floss, vegan waxed for those who care about such things. You can purchase Eco-Dent products at your local health food store, or online at VitaNet (this is not an endorsement of that site).\nAlso, use other personal hygiene products that reduce waste and use as few chemicals as possible.\nFor underarm deodorant, nothing beats Mexsana, a medicated powder. It contains none of the suspect aluminum compounds that all anti-perspirants contain (Mexsana is not an anti-perspirant), and it does such a good job that it will last through even the hottest, sweatiest day. Long's Drug Stores carry it or can special order it, or you can order it online from such places as drugstore.com .\nUse recycled toilet paper at least a few times a year, if not all the time.\nBack to top\nCompost household and yard wastes\nComposting is a form of recycling, with the added benefit that in doing so you have your own source of garden compost and mulch (in a fairly short amount of time if you devote some time to it, or in a longer amount of time if you let nature take its course). By composting, you are returning to the soil many nutrients it will enjoy having. Your flowers and vegetables will show their appreciation in greater blooms and yields as well as healthier and more beautiful plants.\nComposting can be as easy as creating a corner of your yard where you toss coffee grounds, egg shells, vegetable matter, tea bags, leaves, and so on. Warning: Don't put meat, cheese, or the contents of your pooper scooper or cat litter box on your compost heap.\nIf you want to get fancy, you can purchase or make a compost bin. There are many good resources available on composting if you want to get into it in more depth.\nBack to top\nBuy organic\nIf you want fewer pesticides in the environment, aside from stopping the use of them on your own property , you can help achieve this goal by decreasing or stopping the demand for them. Buy organic foods and products as much as possible. This sends a clear message to farmers everywhere that you want food that was created with the intention of sustaining and helping the earth, rather than raping and destroying her, and that you want foods that nurture and heal, rather than foods that, directly or indirectly, contribute to cancer and other health problems .\nAfter you've been buying and eating organic foods (and organic versions of just about everything are available, including tasty pastas and pasta sauces), you'll notice that your taste buds are becoming educated and therefore discriminating. You may also notice that you eat less, because there are more nutrients per gram of organically grown foods than per gram of foods grown using \"modern\" farming practices.\nBack to top\nStop using pesticides and herbicides\nExposure to pesticides and herbicides has been connected with increased risk of cancer and other ailments. They get into the soil and water and poison everything they touch. Most fruit grown using them has the poisons in every cell. And recent research indicates that when these products combine, the risk of cancer isn't additive, it is multiplied. What does that mean? If Poison A presents a cancer rate of 1 person in 2,000, and Poison B has the same rate, then combined, instead of offering a cancer rate of 2 in 2,000, they might now present a cancer rate of 20 in 2,000, or more.\nAnd don't be fooled by those pest control companies that try to tell you their pesticides are \"natural\" and even \"organic.\" Yes, there are some pesticides derived from plants (such as pyrethrins ), but they are still poisonous and bad for the environment. Pyrethrins, for example, are extremely toxic to aquatic life, toxic to bees, and slightly toxic to birds. So, your local pest control organization comes around, sprays the heck out of your yard, you water or it rains, the pyrethins go into the drain and, in this area anyway, directly into the very close, very local creek system, et voila!, you have just paid someone to poison your local ecosystem. Does this make sense?\nSo why use them? Just say no! The natural alternatives are just as effective and are better for the environment.\nFor example, when I lived in Tucson, Arizona, I had some roses, and so did my neighbor. Our first year in our homes, we had a severe infestation of aphids. She dusted her roses with poison; I went out every day and used water and my hands to remove the aphids from my roses. After a while, the ladybugs and spiders moved in to my garden, and I had no more aphids\u2014ever. My neighbor, though, having killed both the \"good\" and the \"bad\" insects, had to keep applying the poisons to her roses month after month and year after year. I invested a few hours of my time once\u2014she invested her time and money forever. And I didn't have to worry about using my roses and rose petals for potpourri and other recipes, because I knew they were organically raised. She had to keep her toddler away from her plants\u2014I didn't worry when I saw my daughter in the backyard stuffing flowers into her mouth.\nBy not using pesticides and herbicides, you are reducing the demand for those products, thereby making it less profitable for companies to produce, advertise, and sell them. You are also doing your part to keep them out of the water, including the water table, and therefore potentially out of your own drinking water.\nWhy is it important to stop the use of pesticides and herbicides?\nThe US government has a policy called \"negligible risk,\" which was lobbied for by the food companies, that allows an \"acceptable\" number of people to contract cancer from exposure to pesticides in food. The risk is considered negligible and therefore acceptable if it doesn't cause cancer in more than one in a million people from each crop use of each pesticide. The risk assessment process doesn't take into account the increased vulnerability of children and the elderly, ignores the dangers of \"inactive\" toxic ingredients in pesticides, and assesses risk as if we're exposed to only one pesticide during our entire lifetime. This means that each year, tens of thousands of people contract cancer from pesticides as a result of this policy. Every day, 1,400 people in the US die from cancer. This is what the US government calls a \"negligible risk.\"\nIf you want to express your dissatisfaction with this policy, you can contact Food & Water Incorporated. They are asking people to sign a \"Declaration of Opposition to Negligible Risk.\" Here is their contact information:\nFood & Water Incorporated\n"}, {"score": 794.46857, "uuid": "3ba1be31-6535-535a-9647-95c5d1d9d05d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1006wb-16-03940", "target_hostname": "galileo.stmarys-ca.edu", "target_uri": "http://galileo.stmarys-ca.edu/sustainsmc/SeeWhatotherschoolsaredoing.htm", "page_rank": 1.1885231e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "See <em>What</em> other schools <em>are</em> doing", "snippet": "<em>The</em> study explores <em>the</em> <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> greenhouse gas emissions of different colleges <em>and</em> universities in <em>the</em> U.S. <em>and</em> analyzes some of <em>the</em> factors that might explain these <em>differences</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "26.

Alaska Wildland Adventures promotes and practices ecotourism by offering trips with a primary focus on visiting remote and relatively unaltered natural environments; maintaining a low impact on the natural environment; promoting travel experiences with an educational emphasis; providing direct benefit to the local economy and inhabitants, thereby providing an incentive for the local community to support the preservation of wild areas.\n\"Often misused as a catch phrase describing nature travel, ecotourism actually represents a means of protection for remote wild areas through sound and sustainable economic development.

The Englishman has written to Zero Waste Scotland to find out how much their scheme will cool the planet.\n"}, {"score": 773.11725, "uuid": "d7de678c-18ab-5262-87df-d72f66cdc378", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1316wb-13-12657", "target_hostname": "www.ci.ann-arbor.mi.us", "target_uri": "http://www.ci.ann-arbor.mi.us/government/publicservices/fieldoperations/solidwasteunit/Pages/Super-Recyclers.aspx", "page_rank": 1.286685e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Home &gt; Government &gt; Public Services &gt; Field Operations &gt; Solid <em>Waste</em> <em>and</em>", "snippet": "Revenues <em>are</em> shared from <em>the</em> selling of all recyclables serviced by <em>the</em> MRF <em>between</em> <em>the</em> City <em>and</em> ReCommunity A list of re-manufacturing markets for <em>the</em> city is available in this 1-pg PDF.

(EPA)\nRecycling and composting efforts nationwide reached 82 million tons in 2009 and provided an annual benefit of 178 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions reduced (the same as taking almost 33 million vehicles off the roads). (EPA)\nFor every one job at a landfill, there are ten jobs in recycling processing and 25 jobs in recycling based manufacturers. The recycling industry employs more workers than the auto industry. (Eco-Cycle)\nAfter being recycled five to seven times, the fibers become too short to bond into new paper. New fibers are added to replace the unusable fiber that wash out of the pulp during the recycling process. A single sheet of paper may contain new fibers as well as fibers that have already been recycled several times. (EPA)\nThe numbers on plastics do not indicate their recyclability.\u00a0 The numbers, which currently go from #1 - # 7 are resin codes for industry use.\u00a0 More information at www.recyclemyplastic.com (Washtenaw County)\nUsing recycled aluminum saves over 95% of the energy needed to create new aluminum.\u00a0 Aluminum cans can be used, recycled, and back on the grocery store shelf in as little as 60 days, and aluminum is durable so the quality doesn\u2019t break down like papers. (The Aluminum Association)\nLocal Facts and Statistics :\nIn 2009, Ann Arborites created an average of 1021 pounds of solid waste per capita, only 64% of the national average.\nAnn Arbor does not accept #3 plastics.\u00a0 #3 plastics are\u00a0Polyvinylchloride, PVC.\u00a0 PVC is commonly used for white plastic bathroom piping.\u00a0 This type of resin is particular hard to recycle and has unwanted chemicals if mixed with other plastics.\nIn 2010, 43% of the Ann Arbor waste stream was diverted from the landfill - either composted or recycled.\nIn the first year of single-stream recycling (2010-2011), Ann Arbor recycling was up 24% and trash was down 10%.\nPapers account for about 75% of tonnages at the City of Ann Arbor\u2019s Materials Recovery Facility (MRF).\nThe cost to collect, sort and sell recyclables from Ann Arbor\u2019s MRF is about the same cost as to collect, transport and bury waste in a landfill. When recycling commodity markets are strong, the sales to paper and steel mills, plastic factories, etc., can gross up to $2 million dollars/year!\nWhy Can't I Recycle This?\nCollection programs vary from community to community because of differences in markets, infrastructure, technology and equipment. There are three main reasons an item will not be accepted by Ann Arbor's curbside recycling program:\n1) Health and Safety -- Your recyclables go on a long journey before being made into new products.\u00a0 They are handled both by machines and by hand.\u00a0 Items such as syringes, batteries, or bottles with attached caps are dangerous to individuals who work with your recyclables and are NOT allowed in your recycling carts.\nIt is also important to clean all recyclables before placing them in your cart.\u00a0 Food contamination can cause odor problems, spread bacteria, and attract pests.\u00a0 Leftover cleaners or detergents can mix while in transport or sorting, leading to dangerous chemical reactions or toxic fumes.\nContamination can also be a health or safety threat for remanufacturers.\nHazardous waste and electronics also are not accepted because of health and environmental safety concerns.\n2) Technology and Equipment -- Your recyclables are collected by automated trucks and then sorted by machinery (and hand) at the Materials Recovery Facility (MRF).\nRecyclables are limited to items which will fit in your cart.\u00a0 Items such as scrap metal larger than 1 cubic foot could cause damage to trucks when compacted and are not accepted. (Bulky plastics are allowed up to the size that fits inside the cart because they do not ordinarily damage the collection trucks.)\nItems such as plastic bags and wire hangers are not accepted because they get caught in gears and conveyor belts, disrupting the entire sorting process at the MRF.\u00a0 Styrofoam is not accepted because it has different chemical properties from other plastics and it breaks and scatters during mechanical processing, contaminating papers and containers.\nSome items are not accepted because our technology cannot sort them properly. For example, plastic lids are not accepted because they are flat, like paper, and often are incorrectly sorted into paper lines at the MRF. Mechanical sorting differentiates between flat paper and 3-D containers.\u00a0 If an item, such as a plastic lid, is sorted into paper and baled with paper, it is not properly recycled. Unmarked plastics and mixed-material items are also unable to be sorted properly.\n3) Markets -- In order to close the recycling loop, recyclables must be sold and made into new products. Many mixed-material items, such as paper coffee pouches lined in foil or chip bags, cannot be easily re-manufactured. Other materials do not have markets. The curbside recycling program is limited to materials with stable markets\nwith reasonable handling time, storage space, and shipping distance. The City and our partners at the MRF work to find\u00a0North American re-manufacturers for our recyclables.\nGuidelines are issued to insure that only items that can be recycled are placed into recycling carts.\nThe MRF sorting process works to keep bales free of unwanted material (such as bottle caps in #1 plastic bales) in order to maintain a high price for bales in the market and a\u00a0high recycling rate.\nThe \u201c Dirty Dozen \u201d are items that are either especially unwanted or are often mistakenly placed in recycling carts:\nGarbage, compost or building materials\nPlastic bags\nPlastic lids, flatware, fast-food drink tops/straws, or toy packaging\nLiquids and dirty containers\nLight bulbs, ceramics, Pyrex, window glass, or mirror glass\nComputers, TVs, electronics, electronic media (DVDs, tapes, etc.)\nHazardous waste (e.g. pesticides, motor oil and filters, car batteries, automotive fluids, household batteries)\nSyringes or medical waste\nBiodegradable plastics (PLA, marked \u201cbiodegradable\u201d or \u201ccompostable\u201d)\nPaper cups, napkins, paper plates, hand towels, candy wrappers, or snack bags\nStyrofoam\nCheck out this handout for more information about the \u201cDirty Dozen.\u201d\nIf I can\u2019t put it in my recycling cart, what can I do with it ?\n(a listing on this site is not and does not imply an endorsement of services or products by the City of Ann Arbor or by any City of Ann Arbor official or employee.)\nFor a more detailed list of items and countywide options, please refer to Washtenaw County\u2019s \u201cTrash to Treasure\u201d guide or Recycle Ann Arbor's A to Z Guide .\nOrganic/Yard Waste for Composting The city has a weekly compost/yard waste pick-up for city residents from April to mid-December.

Vermicomposting (with worms) is another home composting option. The city usually hosts an annual worm bin workshop .\nMeat, oil, bones, grease, dairy products, etc. should never be placed in home compost or in city-issued compost carts because these items can spread bacteria and illness, attract pests, and can cause odor problems.\nHome Toxics and Hazardous Waste such as pesticides, cleansers, polishers, fertilizers, home repair products (e.g. solvents), mercury thermometers, motor oil, roofing tar, oil-based paint (cannot wash brushes with water), florescent light bulbs (CFLS), poisons, etc. More information is on the city's Household Toxics web page .\nWashtenaw County\u2019s Home Toxics Center at 705 N.

Land requirements will be lowest if the maximum possible BOD loading can be applied. The upper limit of the volumetric BOD loading is determined by odor emissions and minimum pH threshold value at which the anaerobic decomposition processes cease to work. The maximum BOD loading rate acceptable to avoid odor nuisance was discussed earlier in section 3.1.\nHowever, the effect of pH must be taken into consideration. Concentrations of H2S, which is the sulphur form responsible for odors, increases sharply as the pH drops below 7.5, phenomenon which may occur if an anaerobic pond is heavily loaded or overloaded (based on a BOD loading rate criterion). Sulphide may also impede methane production in anaerobic ponds if occurring at excess concentrations. The presence of heavy metals will lead to insolubilisation of sulphides (e.g. iron sulphides). Since methanogenesis is the rate-limiting factor in anaerobic metabolism, products from the preceding acidogenesis reaction may accumulate and lead to a pH decrease. Optimum pH for methanogenesis amounts to 6.0 - 8.0. Based on various anaerobic digestion studies, McGarry and Pescod (1970) found that pH = 6.0 probably constitutes the lowest limit for anaerobic tropical ponds. Acidic wastewaters thus require neutralizing prior to treatment in anaerobic ponds as a low pH can be considered a toxicant for anaerobic bacteria. Determination of the maximum BOD loading rate beyond which pH is likely to drop below this threshold value is, therefore, important.\nA study on anaerobic pond treatment of tapioca starch waste conducted by Uddin (1970) revealed that a volumetric BOD loading rate of around 750 g/m3d resulted in a pond pH of 6.0. Fig. 3, which is based on Uddin's results shows that when the BOD loading rate was increased above this value, the volumetric BOD removal rate was reduced. Most likely, pond overloading impaired methanogenesis.\nFig. 3 Influence of Retention Time and Volumetric BOD Loading Rate on Volumetric BOD\nRemoval Rate in Anaerobic Ponds Based on Uddin (1970).\nThe published BOD elimination rates for anaerobic wastewater ponds range from 50 to 85%. Temperature, retention time and BOD loading rate affect removal efficiency. Furthermore, the type of substrate; i.e., sewage, septage or public toilet sludge and its concentration influence the physical and biochemical processes. To achieve high elimination rates at the start of a new operating cycle, some sludge should be left for seeding when emptying a pond. Experience with anaerobic pond treatment in tropical climate reveals that anaerobic digestion is basically completed after about four days (van Haandel and Lettinga 1994). Highest BOD elimination and, thus, reduction of land requirements are attained by applying the highest permissible BOD loading rate (loading limits were discussed before). Multi-stage anaerobic ponds, each operated at a maximum BOD loading rate, will, therefore, have the lowest land requirements. If the influent is of high strength (BOD > 8,000 and COD = 20,000-50,000 mg/l), such as public toilet sludge without co-mixture of septage, removal rates (expressed in g/m3d) will be higher in a multi-stage pond than in a single anaerobic pond. When treating wastewater of low strength (BOD < 2,000 and COD < 10,000 mg/l), high BOD pond loading rates will lead to very short retention times. This may, in turn, cause a decrease in the BOD removal rate. Fig. 3, derived from data presented by McGarry and Pescod (1970) on work performed by Uddin (1970), shows that the BOD removal rates for tapioca starch waste decrease at decreasing retention times, and increase to a threshold value if BOD loading rates are increased.\nAnother factor may affect the BOD and COD removal, which is the ammonia (NH3) toxicity to anaerobic bacteria. Experiments conducted by Sergrist (1997) showed a 50% growth inhibition at a NH3-N/l concentration of 25-30 mg/l. Strong ammonia inhibition in anaerobic ponds can occur at concentrations >80 mg NH3-N/l and may reduce significantly COD elimination to as low as 10% in primary anaerobic ponds (Data is still scarce in this matter).\nIn certain instances, anaerobic ponds become covered with a thick scum layer, which is thought to be beneficial but not essential, and may give rise to increased fly breeding. Solids in the raw wastewater, as well as biomass produced, will settle out in first-stage anaerobic ponds and it is common to remove sludge when it has reached half depth in the pond. This usually occurs after two years of operation at design flow in the case of municipal sewage treatment.\n[Top]\n3.1.2. Pathogen Removal\nIn natural treatment systems such as WSP, the pathogens are progressively removed along the ponds series with the highest removal efficiency taking place in the maturation ponds (Mara et al., 1992). However, the following observations can be carried out from different studies that discussed anaerobic ponds participation in pathogen removal:\nKn\u00f6rr and Torrella (1995) reported a higher removal efficiency of total coliforms in anaerobic ponds when compared to the facultative lagoons (the latter units were however more efficient at removing faecal coliforms). Some figures from this research carried out at a WSP system in the Mediterranean coast of Spain showed removals of one log unit for total coliforms in the anaerobic pond. Meanwhile, the viral removal efficiency was very poor in the anaerobic pond.\nArridge et al. (1995) working on an experimental WSP complex in Northeast Brazil found a one log unit removal in the AP for each of the following indicators: faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and Clostridium perfringens. Salmonellae were reduced from 130 to 70 MPN/100 ml and Vibrio cholerae 01 was reduced from 40 to 10 MPN/l respectively. Anaerobic ponds appear to be essential for high levels of V. cholerae removal.\nOragui et al. (1995) reported the removal of one log unit for rotaviruses in the anaerobic pond of the experimental WSP complex located in Campina Grande in Northeast Brazil.\nGrimason et al. (1993) studied the occurrence and removal of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts and Giardia spp. cysts in eleven WSP systems located in towns across Kenya. The results from this study showed that a significantly higher concentration of Giardia cysts was detected in raw sewage compared to anaerobic pond effluent.\n3.1.3. Nutrient Removal\nNitrogen\nIn WSP systems the nitrogen cycle is at work, with the probable exception of nitrification and denitrication. In anaerobic ponds organic nitrogen is hydrolyzed to ammonia, so ammonia concentrations in anaerobic pond effluents are generally higher than in the raw wastewater (unless the time of travel in the sewer is so long that all the urea has been converted before reaching the WSP). Volatilization of ammonia seems to be the only likely nitrogen removal mechanism occurring to some extent in anaerobic ponds. Soares et al (1996) carried found a very low removal of nitrogen in anaerobic ponds.\nPhosphorus\n[Top]\n3.1.4. Environmental Considerations\nPhysical as well as chemical factors affect the habitat of microorganisms and consequently the anaerobic sewage treatment process. The most important environmental factors to take into consideration are: temperature, pH, degree of mixing, nutrient requirements, ammonia and sulphide control and the presence of toxic compounds in the influent (Van Haandel and Lettinga, 1994).\nTemperature\nAs temperature rises, the rate of reaction also increases. In order to have a reasonable methane production rate, the temperature should be maintained above 20C. Methane production rates are doubled for each 10C temperature increase in the mesophilic range (Droste, 1997).\npH\nAccording to Zehnder et al. (1982), the optimum pH range for all methanogenic bacteria is between 6 and 8, but the optimum value for the group as a whole is close to 7. Van Haandel and Lettinga (1994) reported the same observation and also pointed out that, since acidogenic populations are notably less sensitive to pH variations, acid fermentation will predominate over methanogenic fermentation. The latter may result in souring of the reactor contents. Thus, the system must contain adequate buffering capacity to neutralize the production of volatile acids and carbon dioxide, which dissolves at the operating pressure (Droste, 1997).\nDegree of Mixing\nThe separation of digestion from other processes and the application of mixing were the first major advances in anaerobic treatment. Mixing is an important factor in pH control and maintenance of even environmental conditions. It distributes buffering agents throughout the reactor volume and prevents localized build-up of high concentrations of intermediate metabolic products, which may inhibit methanogenic activity. On the contrary, inadequate mixing propitiates the development of adverse microenvironments.\nNutrient Requirements\nAcidogenic and methanogenic bacteria have low growth rates for a given amount of substrate and this feature results in less nutrient requirements compared to aerobic systems. On the other hand, anaerobic systems produce 20% or less of the amount of sludge produced in aerobic systems for the same substrate and so N and P requirements should decrease proportionally.\nAmmonia and Sulphide Control\nAnaerobic bacteria can acclimatize to high ammonia concentrations, but large fluctuations can be detrimental to the process. Free ammonia is much more toxic than the ammonium ion and it occurs more at high pH values. Wastes with high contents of proteins will generate significant amounts of ammonia that in turn increases alkalinity. Wastes containing blood can produce enough ammonium bicarbonate to raise the pH beyond the optimal range and this requires acid addition for pH correction. In most cases, the protein content of wastes is not high enough to cause ammonia toxicity problems.\nAt the same time, sulphide can be formed in the process due to the reduction of sulphates. Sulphides are inhibitory to methanogens and sulphate-reducers themselves, but according to results of Rinzema (1988), a sulphide concentration of up to 50 mg/l (normally expected in anaerobic sewage treatment systems) is far lower than the minimum concentration causing toxicity problems.\nToxic Compounds\nOther compounds such as heavy metals and chloro-organics affect the rate of anaerobic digestion even at very low concentrations. Apart from sulphide, oxygen is also a potentially toxic compound, which can enter the reactor together with influent flow. However, the presence of these compounds at inhibitory concentrations is unlikely in domestic wastewater.\n[Top]\n3.2. Facultative Ponds\nFacultative ponds (1-2 m deep) are of two types: primary facultative ponds, which receive raw wastewater, and secondary facultative ponds, which receive settled wastewater (usually the effluent from anaerobic ponds). They are designed for BOD removal on the basis of a relatively low surface loading (100-400 kg BOD/ha d at temperature between 20C and 25C) to permit the development of a healthy algal population as the oxygen for BOD removal by the pond bacteria is mostly generated by algal photosynthesis. Due to the algae facultative ponds are colored dark green, although they may occasionally appear red or pink (especially when slightly overloaded) due to the presence of anaerobic purple sulphide-oxidizing photosynthetic bacteria. The algae that tend to predominate in the turbid waters of facultative ponds are the motile genera (such as Chlamydomonas, Pyrobotrys and Euglena) as these can optimize their vertical position in the pond water column in relation to incident light intensity and temperature more easily than non-motile forms (such as Chlorella, although this is also fairly common in facultative ponds). The concentration of algae in a healthy facultative pond depends on loading and temperature, but is usually in the range 500-2000 g chlorophyll a per litre.\nHow Facultative Ponds Work?\nEffluent entering the facultative pond from the anaerobic pond (secondary facultative pond) is converted into carbon dioxide, water and new bacterial and algae cells in the presence of oxygen, i.e., aerobically.\nAlgae populations within the aerobic pond require sunlight. They develop and produce oxygen in excess of their own requirements. It is this excess of oxygen that is used by bacteria to further break down the organic matter within the effluent. The algal production of oxygen occurs near the surface of aerobic ponds to the depth to which light can penetrate (i.e. typically up to 500 mm). Oxygen can also be introduced by wind.\nAerobic pond is more accurately termed \"facultative\", as in practice the pond usually has an aerobic upper layer and anaerobic lower layer. This facultative condition occurs because high oxygen levels cannot be maintained to the total depth of aerobic ponds. So a fully aerobic surface layer develops, along with an aerobic/anaerobic intermediate layer, and a fully anaerobic layer on the pond bottom. Oxygen is unable to be maintained at the lower layers if:\nThe pond is too deep, and the color too dark, to allow light to penetrate fully.\nThe demand for oxygen in the lower layer is higher than the supply. Demand is increased with high levels of organic matter. The anaerobic layer will be deeper in an aerobic pond where there is an extremely high organic matter content of the inflowing effluent.\nThe surface layer, rich in oxygen, is not adequately mixed with the bottom layer.\nThere is a combination of these conditions.\nAs a result of the photosynthetic activities of the pond algae, there is a diurnal variation in the concentration of dissolved oxygen. For a typical facultative pond, the water column will be predominantly aerobic at the time of peak sun radiation and predominantly anaerobic at sunrise. After sunrise, the dissolved oxygen level gradually rises to a maximum in the mid-afternoon, after which it falls to a minimum during the night. The position of the oxypause (the depth at which the dissolved oxygen concentration reaches zero) similarly changes, as does the pH since at peak algal activity carbonate and bicarbonate ions react to provide more carbon dioxide for the algae, so leaving an excess of hydroxyl ions with the result that the pH can rise to above 9 which kills faecal bacteria. The wind has an important effect on the behavior of facultative ponds, as it induces vertical mixing of the pond liquid. Good mixing ensures a more uniform distribution of BOD, dissolved oxygen, bacteria and algae and hence a better degree of waste stabilization. In the absence of wind-induced mixing, the algal population tends to stratify in a narrow band, some 20cm thick, during daylight hours. This concentrated band of algae moves up and down through the top 50 cm of the pond in response to changes in incident light intensity, and causes large fluctuations in effluent quality (especially BOD and suspended solids) if the effluent take-off point is within this zone. The operation of the facultative pond is shown in Fig. 4.\nFig. 4 Operation of the facultative pond (Tchobanoglous and Schroeder 1987).\nThe facultative pond will remove odor and kill most pathogenic microorganisms. As a complete process, the facultative pond serves to:\nFurther treat the effluent anaerobically through separation, dissolving and digestion of organic material.\nAerobically break down most remaining organic solids near the pond surface.\nReduce the amount of disease-causing microorganisms.\nAllow the loss of 20% to 30% of the ammonia, contained within the effluent, into the air.\nStore residues from digestion, as well as non-degradable solids, as bottom sludge.\nAllow treated effluent to pass out into a waterway or additional treatment system (i.e. an additional pond, wetland system or for land application).\nSometimes two or more consecutive smaller facultative ponds are constructed instead of a very large one. This may be more practical for effective desludging and stirring or when the pond is too long for the site and interferes with existing structures.\nIn primary facultative ponds (those that receive raw wastewater) the above functions of anaerobic and secondary facultative ponds are combined. Around 30% of the influent BOD leaves a primary facultative pond in the form of methane (Marais, 1970). This type of pond is designed generally for the treatment of weaker wastes and in sensitive locations where anaerobic ponds odor would be unacceptable.\n3.2.1. BOD Removal\nThe activity of further anaerobic oxidation and the aerobic conversion of effluent to carbon dioxide, water and new bacterial and algae cells can result in removal of 80% of the BOD5 of the effluent flowing into the facultative pond (which means an overall removal in the order of 95% over the two ponds). This removal, and the subsequent quality of the outflow, depends on:\nAn adequate oxygen supply.\nSufficient retention time.\nWarm temperatures.\nAn absence of high concentrations of chemical pollutants. High concentrations of cleaning chemicals and drenches will slow the system's ability to break down effluent solids.\nMoreover, as a result of the algal-bacterial activities described in the previous section, a high proportion of the BOD that does not leave the pond as methane ends up as algal cells. Thus in secondary facultative ponds (and in the upper layers of primary facultative ponds) \"sewage BOD\" is converted into \"algal BOD\" and this has important implications for effluent quality requirements. This provides even better BOD quality of the effluent from a facultative ponds as most of the BOD contained (70 to 90%) will be \"algal BOD\".\nWhen a facultative pond is used as a primary treatment, BOD removal may be very efficient. Abis (2002) reported a BOD removal in a pilot-scale facultative ponds in the United Kingdom (surface loading 51-117 kg/ha d) to an average of 91% (between 67.5% and 98.6%). These values include the contribution of algae in the effluent. With the algal (and other) solids removed from the effluent, the average removal was 97.2% (with a range of 89.7-99.7%).\n3.2.2. Pathogen Removal: Bacteria, Viruses and Parasites\nFaecal bacteria are mainly removed in facultative and especially maturation ponds whose size and number determine the numbers of faecal bacteria (usually modeled in terms of faecal coliforms) in the final effluent, although there is some removal in anaerobic ponds principally by sedimentation of solids-associated bacteria. The principal mechanisms for faecal bacterial removal in facultative and maturation ponds are now known to be:\nTime (retention time as pathogen attenuation occurs over time),\nTemperature (faecal bacteria dies off increases with temperature),\nHigh pH (> 9), and\nHigh light intensity together with high dissolved oxygen concentration.\nRegarding viruses removal, Little is definitely known about the mechanisms of viral removal in WSP, but it is generally recognized that it occurs by adsorption on to settleable solids (including the pond algae) and consequent sedimentation.\nSome parasites can be removed as well. Protozoan cysts and helminth eggs are removed by sedimentation. Their settling velocities are quite high (for example, 3.4 x10-4 m/s in the case of Ascaris lumbricoides), and consequently most removal takes place in the anaerobic and facultative ponds. It has recently become possible to design WSP for helminth egg removal (Ayres et al., 1992).\n3.2.3. Nutrient Removal\nNitrogen\nIn facultative and maturation ponds, ammonia is incorporated into new algal biomass. Eventually the algae become moribund and settle to the bottom of the pond; around 20% of the algal cell mass is non-biodegradable and the nitrogen associated with this fraction remains immobilized in the pond sediment. That associated with the biodegradable fraction eventually diffuses back into the pond liquid and is recycled back into algal cells to start the process again. At high pH, some of the ammonia will leave the pond by volatilization. Mara and Pearson (1986) point out that under certain conditions some algal species are able to adapt to and withstand concentrations of up to 50 mg/l.\nThere is little evidence for nitrification (and hence denitrification, unless the wastewater is high in nitrates). The populations of nitrifying bacteria are very low in WSP due primarily to the absence of physical attachment sites in the aerobic zone, although inhibition by the pond algae may also occur. Total nitrogen removal in WSP systems can reach 80% or more, and ammonia removal can be as high as 95%.\nPhosphorus\nThe efficiency of total phosphorus removal in WSP depends on how much leaves the pond water column and enters the pond sediments. This occurs due to sedimentation as organic P in the algal biomass and precipitation as inorganic P (principally as hydroxyapatite at pH levels above 9.5), compared to the quantity that returns through mineralization and resolubilization. As with nitrogen, the phosphorus associated with the non-biodegradable fraction of the algal cells remains in the sediments. Thus the best way of increasing phosphorus removal in WSP is to increase the number of maturation ponds, so that progressively more and more phosphorus becomes immobilized in the sediments. From a well functioning two-pond system, 70% mass removal of total phosphorus may be expected.\nHeavy Metals\nPolprasert and Charnpratheep (1989) and Kaplan et al. (1987) examined the fate of heavy metals in such ponds. Adsorption of metals was increased in attached-growth stabilization pond as compared to stabilization ponds without attached-growth. Kaplan et al. reports only a slight decrease in total metals concentration, however the particulate fraction was mostly solubilized.\nA study by Moshe (1972) showed that high concentrations of metal ions (Cd, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Cr) are toxic to Chlorella species, the most common species in stabilization ponds, and adversely affect pond efficiency. However, high pH (higher than 8) causes metal ions to precipitate and allows pond purification processes to occur normally.\n3.2.4. Removal of Algae from Facultative Ponds Effluent\nMany techniques have been developed to remove the algae from effluents, these include rock filtration, grass plots, floating macrophytes and herbivorous fish. Also, the use of maturation ponds can reduce the algal concentration considerably provided the system is not overloaded.\n4. Additional Technologies Used to Improve WSP Effluent\nThe use of anaerobic and facultative ponds system, as the only wastewater treatment before final discharge, was proven to be satisfactory under different circumstances and for various agricultural and aquacultural effluent reuses (Mara 2001, Pearson et al 1996). However, when some of the effluent quality limits are not satisfied, choosing a supplementary (or even alternative technology) in order to improve the effluent quality will be a serious option. The choice of adding new agents to the existing anaerobic and facultative ponds or choosing more advanced SWP treatment systems should be taken in the light of the following factors:\nThe vital need of effluent quality improvement (especially if used for unrestricted irrigation).\nThe feasibility of the total cost of the additional or alternate system (equipment, land, operation and maintenance) versus the amount of effluent quality improvement.\nEffectiveness of the selected technology (scientifically/practically proven).\nPracticality and workability.\nResources availability.\n4.1. Integrated Facultative Ponds (Advanced Facultative Ponds)\nOne possible solution to benefit from the advantages of both anaerobic and aerobic ponds and suppress their disadvantages is to integrate the best functions of each pond type into a single pond to allow the symbiotic relationships of related microorganisms to proceed unrestrained (Fig. 5). The advanced facultative pond is deep to promote sedimentation of wastewater solids and anaerobic decomposition of methane. Its most attractive feature is its high capability of wastewater total suspended solids (TSS) removal, in addition to BOD removal. The pond is designed so that its surface remains aerobic, thus reducing potential odor problem. Biogas may be collected using submerged gas canopy and potentially used for energy production. Until these integrated systems have been fully developed, most designers will continue to rely upon the traditional stabilization pond treatment systems.\nFig. 5 Integrated (Advanced) Facultative Pond.\n4.2. Mechanical Aeration\nAeration introduces oxygen to effluent standing in a facultative pond, so that bacteria can effectively convert the organic solids to carbon dioxide, water and bacteria biomass. Mechanically aerated ponds generate turbulence to mix all the effluent in the pond and introduce oxygen through equipment that either\nIntroduces air into the effluent by injecting air under the pond surface (floating pumps).\nExposes more effluent surface area to the air through spraying effluent into the air or agitating the effluent.\nAerator numbers and configuration are selected to perform the amount of oxygen generation needed. This technology can significantly reduce the nutrient, ammonia, odor, and BOD level in the resulted effluent. However, cost of the aerators including installation, operation and maintenance shall be taken into account in order to assess the feasibility of using such equipment (this basically varies from one project to another).\n4.3. Anaerobic Digestion\nThis involves of using microorganisms to turn the complex organic solids less complex compounds. The end products of anaerobic digestion are biogas (mix of methane and carbon dioxide) and a stabilized treated liquid. The biogas can be collected and used as an alternative energy source, but a storage space is required to fulfill this operation. This procedure reduces BOD but not the nutrient. In addition, Anaerobic digestion adds more complexity, equipment and cost to the overall effluent treatment system. A facultative pond treatment would still be required to improve the quality of the effluent.\n4.4. Chemical Treatment and Biological Additives\nSeveral kinds of additives are available to control odors and break down crusting and organic matter. The main ones are the followings:\nBacterial Additives (bioremedation): Using bacteria to degrade solids in ponds so that they are eventually liquefied. This may result in changes in BOD (may drop or may rise) and TSS (drop) concentrations and reduce temporary odor emission.\nElectrolytic Methods: It is claimed that copper electrodes immersed in the pond reduce odors, kill pathogenic microorganisms and prevent build-up of crust. The cost of this technology is still high (copper probes need to be replaced every 12 to 18 months, in addition to maintenance, operation and energy costs).\n4.5. Stabilization Ponds and Supporting Growth Media\nIn the pond modified by Zhao and Wang (1996), attached-growth media (AGM) or so-called artificial fibrous carriers were installed. This type of media consists of fine strings of polyvinyl acetate, with specific surface area of 1,236 m2/m3 and cost only US$ 5/m3. A pilot-scale investigation has been conducted by them, using three ponds with working dimensions of 4.0 m in depth, 1.2 m in width and 1.1 m in depth. This study has confirmed that the incorporation of AGM enhanced the performance of conventional WSPs by formation of a great number of small stable ecological systems around AGM, being abundant in bio-species from bacteria and algae to protozoa, increasing the biomass concentration, improving the biological distribution. Better removal efficiencies of COD (75.6%), BOD (90.2%) and NH4-N (68.5%) had been achieved in the WSPs with AGM than in the conventional WSPs, although the total retention time had been shortened to 7.5 days. Although capital investment in the system may increase, the system holds the potential to reduce retention times and decrease spatial requirements of the WSP technology (Yu, et al., 1997).\n[Top]\n4.6. Advanced Integrated Wastewater Pond System\nDeveloped by Professor William J. Oswald and his co-workers at the University of California, Berkeley over the past four decades wastewater treatment and algae production systems called Advanced Integrated Wastewater Pond Systems (AIWPS) are potentially feasible for application in the developing world (Oswald, 1990).\nAlthough AIWPS may appear to be an adapted traditional pond system, each AIWPS facility is uniquely designed and incorporates a series of low-cost ponds or earthwork reactors. Depending on specific effluent characteristics, regulatory requirements, human resources, and local climatic conditions, a typical AIWPS facility consists of at least four ponds in series (Fig. 6):\nAn advanced facultative pond with fermentations pits;\nAlgal high rate Pond where photosynthetic oxygenation, oxidation, and nutrient assimilation occurs (with pedal wheel).\nAlgal settling ponds; and\nA maturation pond where final effluent storage and further natural disinfection occurs.\nAIWPS facilities are designed to minimize the accumulation of sludge and to maximize the production of oxygen through algal photosynthesis. Algal biomass is produced and can be used as a nitrogen-rich fertilizer, or as protein-rich animal or fish feed (for further cultivation of high protein foodstuffs), modern medicine and even cosmetics for the idle.\nThey are cost-effective, require little maintenance and have generally performed well in terms of BOD5 and solids removal. Moreover, AIWPS require similar land area to conventional lagoons, virtually eliminate sludge disposal, produce less odor, and may be adapted to energy (methane) recovery. However, AIWPS cost about $15,000 to set up, and $100 a year to power the paddle wheel and the algal settling pond needs to be desludged once to twice a year. In addition, note that this type of technology is not energy cost free.\nFig. 6 AIWSP system (adapted from NWA website).\n4.7. Sheaffer Modular Reclamation and Reuse System (SMRRS)\nSheaffer International markets a variation of the AIWPS described in the preceding section. The Sheaffer system is described as a Modular Reclamation and Reuse System producing no sludge, no odor, and enabling 100% recovery of nutrient rich water for irrigation. The system is comprised of a deep aerated treatment cell, a storage cell, and three moving parts, described as a grinder pump, a compressor/blower, and an irrigation system (Sheaffer International LTD., 1998).\nThe first stage of the process uses the grinder pump to reduce sewage solids influent and injects it to an anaerobic zone at the bottom of the treatment cell where it undergoes anaerobic reduction for a 14- to 30-day period. This zone acts as a mesophilic reactor. Solids settle out of the anaerobic zone to the base of the deep cell, and are stored for a time period of 20 to 30 years. The second stage of the process, the compressor/blower, injects air into the treatment cell just above the anaerobic zone to create aerobic conditions at the surface level of the cell. The cells are designed to provide 14- to 36-day treatment and further reductions of organic materials (Sheaffer International LTD., 1998).\nSolid components are broken down into simple organic acids, methane carbon dioxide, sulphide, ammonia, inorganic compounds, and water. The nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are dissolved and remain in solution for use in agricultural irrigation.\nFig. 7 SMRRS (Sheaffer International LTD. 1998).\n4.8. Aerated Ponds/Lagoons\nA number of facultative ponds have been designed, or more commonly retrofitted, with surface aerators to boost dissolved oxygen levels and/or to aid mixing.\nThere is often confusion between these systems and what are typically called aerated lagoons. Unlike facultative ponds, aerated lagoons are designed to operate at high bacterial cell mass concentrations. These require a high power input for aeration and in some cases incorporate biomass return. They operate at much shorter hydraulic residence times and as a consequence of this, and their increased depth, do not develop significant algal populations. Aerated lagoons are essentially designed to work as a form of lowly loaded activated sludge. Mechanically supplied oxygen increases treatment efficiency and reduces land requirements. However, the high-cost power input is sufficient only for diffusing oxygen into the pond and not for mixing the contents.\n[Top]\n4.9. High-rate Algal Ponds\nOriginally developed by Oswald at the University of California in the sixties, high-rate algal ponds have continued to be developed and implemented particularly in the United States. These systems are shallower than a facultative pond and operate at shorter hydraulic retention times. A paddlewheel is normally incorporated to drive the water around a \"race-track\" shaped pond. The oxygen production is reported to be significantly higher than typical facultative pond designs. The micro algae produced in these systems are also reported to have good settling properties (Green et al., 1996).\n4.10. Rock Filters\nWaste stabilization ponds often have high concentrations of TSS in the effluent, which may or may not be desirable depending on the irrigation delivery method. Several polishing options are feasible to use in combination with WSPs to upgrade pond effluents, thereby increasing the options for effluent reuse. Middlebrooks (1995) suggests that many low-cost methods exist for polishing WSP effluent, which include intermittent sand filtration and rock filters.\nRock filters, when used in conjunction with WSPs, have been shown to upgrade WSP effluent. Research at a pilot-scale rock filter demonstration conducted at the Assamra WSPs in Jordan showed that effluent content reductions could be reduced greatly. TSS and BOD were reduced by 60%, total faecal coliform count (TFCC) by a maximum of 94% and T-P by 46% at a loading rate of 0.33-0.044 kg/m3 of TSS (Saidam, Ramadan and Butler, 1995). If high levels of TSS are not an issue in an irrigation scheme and there is no risk of clogging irrigation equipment, high TSS may be advantageous as they will add organic matter to the soil matrix.\n4.11. Maturation Ponds and Constructed Wetlands\nMaturation ponds (low-cost polishing ponds, which succeed the primary or secondary facultative pond) are primarily designed for tertiary treatment, i.e., the removal of pathogens, nutrients and possibly algae. They are very shallow (usually around 1 m depth, although Mara (1997) believes that at this reduced depth emergent plant growth and mosquito breeding problems can result) to allow light penetration to the bottom and aerobic conditions throughout the whole depth. The ponds follow a secondary treatment i.e., a facultative pond. The size and number of maturation ponds needed in series is determined by the required retention time to achieve a specified effluent pathogen concentration. In the absence of effluent limits for pathogens, maturation ponds act as a buffer for facultative pond failure and are useful for nutrient removal (Mara and Pearson, 1998). Mara (1997) notes that if an anaerobic and secondary facultative pond system is used, this will produce an effluent suitable for restricted irrigation. Therefore, additional maturation ponds will only be needed if a higher quality effluent is required.\nAnother technology that may replace maturation ponds to improve WSP system performance is the use of constructed wetlands. Wetlands are areas which support the growth of a variety of plant species adapted to flooded conditions for part of, or the entire, year. The plants are densely spaced and, together with the shallow water, provide habitats for animal, bird and insect communities. Constructed wetland systems are designed to simulate and optimize filtering and biodegradation processes that occur in natural wetlands. They are a possible solution to improve the performance of pond systems, as they can \"polish\" wastewater effluent before its discharge to a waterway.\nDuring summer months, such a system may even result in zero discharge to waterways, due to evaporation and evapotranspiration of the water component from the wetland.\n5. Siting of Ponds and Geotechnical Aspects\nWhen choosing a site to construct a pond system, an area should be selected where the water table is deep and the soil is heavy and impermeable. Silt or clay soils are ideal for pond foundations and construction. Building ponds over coarse sands, gravels, fractured rock or other materials, that will allow effluent to seep out of the pond or allow groundwater to enter in, should be avoided.\nNo part of the system to be within 200 m (preferably 500 m) of any dwelling house. If possible, ponds should be sited downwind from dwellings, roads and other public places. The greater the distance from a potential complainant the better.\nSoil must be suitable for pond stability. Geotechnical aspects, if not taken into consideration, may cause the WSP system to malfunction. A geotechnical investigation of the site should be made during the design stage to ensure correct embankment design and to determine whether the soil is sufficiently permeable to require the pond to be lined. A stable and impermeable embankment core shall be formed, whether chosen from an available local or imported soil. After compaction, the soil should have a coefficient of permeability of 10-7 m/s (Mara and Pearson, 1998). The following geotechnical considerations should be taken when constructing the embankment:\nEmbankments must be well constructed to prevent seepage, excessive settlement and erosion over time.\nEmbankment slopes are commonly 1 (vertical) to 3 (horizontal) internally and 1 to 1.5-2 externally.\nSlope stability should be ascertained according to standard soil mechanics procedures for small earth dams.\nExternal embankments should be protected from storm water erosion by providing adequate drainage.\nInternal embankments should be protected from wave action erosion by using precast concrete slabs or stone rip-rap at top water level.\nThe following are additional general considerations when siting a pond:\nAllowing for a straight run of pipelines, tractors and desludging vehicles to the ponds.\nTo minimize earthworks, site should be flat or gently sloping.\nSiting in an open area so as to take advantage of the sun and wind, which assist the efficient operation of the facultative pond and thus improve the quality of the discharge.\nIf soil is permeable (>10-6 m/s), a plastic membrane plastic may be used to line the pond.\nKeeping systems away from overhead or underground power lines.\nKeeping systems from potable water lines.\nAvoiding sites that are likely to flood, have steep slopes that run towards a waterway, spring or bore hole, are pipe drained or mole ploughed, are likely to freeze over, or have recently been cleared of trees or similarly disturbed.\nConstructing the system below the effluent elevation so that gravity can be used to carry the effluent.\nOrientating the longest diagonal dimension of the pond parallel to the direction of the prevailing wind.\nPonds should not be located within 2 km of airports, as any birds attracted to the ponds may constitute a risk to air navigation.\n6. Design Criteria\nWastewater treatment of only anaerobic and facultative ponds is widely considered as the most pragmatic option (at least as initial treatment). These two types, when used in series, are proven to be the most economical water treatment system with an effective performance. Basically, there are four approaches to wastewater stabilization pond design: loading rates, empirical design equations, reactor theory, and mechanistic modeling. Loading rates, as a design criterion, is a simple approach, widely used and recommended in most of the wastewater standard design handbooks worldwide.\n6.1. Effluent Limits\nEffluent limits represent the maximum amount of pollutants allowed to discharge from wastewater to its final destination (waterway, reservoir for reuse, etc.). These limits vary from country to another due to geographical, climatic and socio-economical reasons. They vary as well with the character of the wastewater final destination. For example, the effluent quality of wastewater discharged to the ocean would be less stringent than the effluent quality of wastewater used for agriculture.\nEffluent limits characterize the required and accepted quality of the discharged wastewater. Hence, prior to design, these limits must be known (from local municipal effluent standards publications) since they will be used as the water quality design objectives. An example is the European Union quality requirements for WSP effluents being discharged into surface and coastal waters:\nFiltered BOD = 25 mg/l (non-algal BOD)\nFiltered COD = 125 mg/l (non-algal COD)\nSuspended solids = 150 mg/l\nTogether with, for discharge into designated \"sensitive areas subject to eutrophication\":\nTotal nitrogen = 15 mg/l\nTotal phosphorus = 2 mg/l\n(Although, if the population served is > 100,000, these last two requirements are reduced to 10 and 1 mg/l, respectively) (Council of the European Communities, 1991a).\nAnother example is from India. The general standards for the discharge of treated wastewaters into inland surface waters are given in the Environment Protection Rules (CPCB, 1996). The more important of these for WSP design are as follow:\nBOD 30 mg/l (non-filtered)\nTotal N 100 mg N/l\nTotal ammonia 50 mg N/l\nFree ammonia 5 mg N/l\nSulphide 2 mg/l\n"}, {"score": 768.375, "uuid": "d5d6ece8-051c-57c8-b2d0-483a67cb5ead", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0506wb-41-23000", "target_hostname": "www.engg.ksu.edu", "target_uri": "http://www.engg.ksu.edu/HSRC/abstr94.html", "page_rank": 1.1762148e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Abstracts of <em>the</em> Conference on Hazardous <em>Waste</em> Research, 1994", "snippet": "These data will be analyzed to ascertain if there <em>are</em> <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> vegetated <em>and</em> <em>non</em>-vegetated soils, also <em>between</em> plant species with regard to leaching, degradation, plant uptake, mineralization of <em>the</em> 14C-labelled pyrene.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 763.6945, "uuid": "88e64d3f-f04c-58be-a90b-dca86a44be1f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1701wb-39-15616", "target_hostname": "plasticsandtheplanet.com", "target_uri": "http://plasticsandtheplanet.com/archives/category/basics/materials", "page_rank": 1.962342e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Materials | Plastics <em>and</em> <em>the</em> Planet", "snippet": "It is best known for being made of <em>non</em>-petroleum materials,<em>biodegradable</em> <em>and</em> causing issues with existing <em>waste</em> disposal infrastructure.

They also need to have a high resistance to piercing, ripping and tearing.\nGiven the range of compostable materials on the market and their different in performance in different applications specifying a bag which is fit for purpose can be difficult. To help resolve this issue, the Belgian certification body Vincotte has developed a testing scheme called VGS which incorporates both compostability and bag integrity.\u00a0 Bags which are already certified to EN13432 are filled with up to 18 Kg of active organic waste and acclimatised at 22 oC for 3.5 days followed by 40 oC for a further 3.5 days and then 20 oC for a further 24 hours.\u00a0 After this bags are subjected to drop tests and if they do not tear then they achieve VGS1, the cycle is continued for up to five weeks depending on the level required.\u00a0 So, a bag which has VGS2 will be suitable for garden waste collected on a fortnightly cycle.\nKitchen Waste\nIncreasingly Local Authorities are looking at developing food waste collection schemes that not only provide a service but also enable high levels of captures.\u00a0 The two go hand in hand; a good service encourages high participation with high capture and vice-versa.\u00a0 Whilst food waste collection is in its infancy in the UK, trends are already beginning to appear especially with regard to capture and participation.\nThere are a number of different ways to collect food waste: separately with caddies and free or paid-for certified compostable liners, separately with caddies and no liners (food wrapped in newspaper or loose), or together with garden waste.\u00a0The impact of these different systems is remarkable and if the intention is to encourage capture of food waste then it is beginning to become clear that weekly separate collection using caddies and liners along with strong ongoing communication are essential.\nCurrently there are ~65 local authorities who are trialling or have rolled out separate collections of food waste and a similar number who collect food together with garden waste in wheeled bins.\u00a0 Research is showing that those who co-collect are capturing significantly less food than those who collect separately. On average the separate collections using liners are capturing 2.5-3.5 Kg / hld / wk and have participation levels of 60-85+%.\u00a0 Where food and garden waste is co-collected, the amount of food waste captured is typically 0.5-1.5 Kg / hld / wk \u2013 there is no reported data on those who actually separate out food but the very low captures suggest <25%.\nThe difference in food waste capture between separate collections and co-collections is clear but what is also becoming clearer is the role that caddy liners are making.\u00a0 Reviews of UK based food waste collection schemes has identified that public perception, particularly of the \u201cick\u201d factor as a potential barrier to participation and thus capture.\u00a0 Kitchen caddies (5-10l) have been shown to substantially increase participation and recovery in such schemes.\u00a0 However, the vast majority of the food waste schemes currently operating in the UK use solid caddies with or without liners, which may slightly reduce but not remove the \u201cick\u201d factor.\nThe vented kitchen caddy system which combines the caddy with a compostable bag has increased transpiration capability providing a number of key benefits over a solid caddy.\u00a0 By allowing the food waste to \u2018breathe\u2019 the material starts to dry out and weight loss through evaporation can be as high as 30% in just a few days.\u00a0 This is extremely important in a kitchen as it prevents the material from turning anaerobic and thus odour is significantly reduced.\u00a0 In addition the condensate that can accumulate at the bottom of traditional closed caddies is avoided.\u00a0 The convenience of the system means that once it is full, the bag of food scraps can simply be removed and replaced without the need to wash the caddy.\u00a0 The vented system is now considered state of the art across much of Europe and is increasing in prevalence in the UK and the key to its success as measured by capture and public participation, is convenience.\nThe benefits of systems which use compostable liners extend beyond the household to the collection, transport and composting systems where uncontained, fermenting food waste can lead to odour and health and safety issues.\u00a0 From a local collection authority viewpoint one of the key benefits of using compostable bags comes from the increased efficiency of collection.\u00a0 Since the bags can simply be lifted out of the outdoor caddy / bucket, collection operatives can visit many more properties before returning to the collection vehicle.\u00a0 An example of this in the UK is in Preston where they have no problems completing their busiest round \u2013 1753 properties / ~60% participation \u2013 in a day which they estimate to be twice as efficient as the next best separate food collection scheme which does not use bags.\nConclusion\nTruly compostable bags have enormous potential, especially in separate food waste collection schemes and will become progressively more widespread as the demand for sustainable solutions increases.\u00a0 Maintaining and improving both efficiency and quality is key to the entire biological resource industry, using bags certified to EN13432 will help reach both these goals.\nThis case study was composed by Tony Breton on behalf of Novamont SpA.\nNovamont SpA Nova mont SpA is a world leader in the sector of bioplastics made with raw materials obtained from renewable sources of agricultural origin.

Effects of residential food waste disposers on municipal wastewater and solid waste management. 91st Annual Meeting and Exhibition of the Air and Waste Management Association, June 14-18, San Diego, CA, Air and Waste Management Association.\nDisposal of putrescible solid wastes remains a challenge for municipalities and local authorities. Decomposing wastes breed odors, attract vermin, are costly to collect, transport and process, and, if disposed of in landfills, generate leachate, organic compounds, some toxic, and large quantities of global warming gases. Most municipalities have sought to reduce this burden by encouraging use of kitchen food waste disposers (FWD), integrating treatment of food and sewage solids. In most of the United States, the proportion of food waste in the municipal solid waste (MSW) stream has decreased over the period 1960 to 1994 from 13.9% to 6.7% of the MSW collected(1). This is attributed more to the growing use of food waste disposers than to the increase in non-organic waste(2). However some municipalities are accompanying use of FWDs with separate collection of food wastes or mixed waste processing to produce a biosolid for land application. Moving in a different direction, recently, two wastewater treatment agencies have adopted policies restricting use of FWDs by commercial food establishments.\nFWDS are used to dispose of food wastes in about 45% of U.S. households(3).\nOn average, the in-sink appliances grind about half of the 0.30 lbs/capita/day of wet food waste generated in a typical household, leaving 0.15 lbs/cap/day of food waste, 70% of which is water(4), to be added from the FWDs via the collection system to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) where they add 0.05 lbs/capita/day of food solids to sewage solids. The remaining 0.15 lbs/cap/day of wet food waste are added to MSW.\nKetzenberger, B. A. (1995). Part 1 - Water Use by Kitchen Food Waste Disposers in Households.\u00a0 Part 2 - Effect of Ground Food Wastes on Septic Tank/Soil Absorption Fields - Critical Review of Literature. Civil and Environmental Engineering. Madison, University of Wisconsin: 134.\u00a0 Master Thesis.\nEvans, T. (2007). Environmental Impact Study of Food Waste Disposers, Tim Evans Environment: 53.\nExecutive Summary\nThis study examines the financial and environmental impacts of food waste disposers (FWD) and finds that they provide a cost-effective, convenient and hygienic means of separating putrescible domestic kitchen food waste (KFW) at source and diverting it from landfill. The study also finds that this route costs less and has a smaller global warming potential than the routes comprising kerbside collection followed by centralised composting or landfill.\nHome composting is ideal for garden waste because of both treating and also using the treated material where it is generated (the proximity principle). Bokashi treatment and wormeries have enthusiastic followings but users still need to have somewhere to use the treated material. Some householders are unable (e.g. apartment dwellers) or are not inclined to practise home composting.\nIn terms of Best Value Performance Indicators, FWD reduce BV84 (kilograms of household waste collected per head of population), BV86 (cost of household waste collection per household) and BV87 (cost of waste disposal per tonne municipal waste).\nThe National Audit Office concluded that England will not achieve the Landfill Directive targets without a step change in plans and that emphasising recycling alone is unlikely to be the answer. Part of the problem is lack of infrastructure for treating biodegradable municipal waste and this is linked with the delays consequent on the planning process. H&W (Herefordshire Council and Worcestershire County Council) have been pioneering in promoting installation of FWD. FWD have the benefit of separating at source a difficult fraction of biodegradable MSW (because it is wet and malodorous) and diverting it using existing infrastructure and without entailing any regulatory bureaucracy.\nThe net global warming potential1 (GWP) of separate collection and treatment of KFW by composting is -14 kgCO2e/tKFW allowing for fertiliser offset and carbon sequestration when the compost is used on land. For households with FWD feeding to wastewater treatment works where sludge is treated by anaerobic digestion, the biogas is used as renewable energy and the biosolids are used on land (which is the pathway for Severn Trent Water\uff92s works in H&W and Welsh Water\uff92s works in Herefordshire) the GWP is better than -168 kgCO2e/tKFW2. In contrast, landfill is +743 kgCO2e/tKFW.\nAssuming that KFW is 17.6% of household waste, the cost of collecting and disposing KFW via the solid waste route in H&W averages \u00a318.63 per household*year and the quantity is 180 kgKFW per household*year (2005/06 actuals). This is the approximate annual saving for each installed FWD. The saving will increase, and the payback period will decrease, as the cost of treating KFW increases with ABPR compliant treatment replacing landfilling. For example, letsrecycle.com estimates the current gate fee for composting KFW at a site that complies with the Animal By-Products Regulations is \u00a342-52 /t. By February 2007, 640 FWD had been installed under the H&W cashback scheme at a total cost of \u00a339,650, i.e. \u00a362 per FWD, which is a payback period [at direct cost current savings] of only 3 years and 4 months. The ground KFW is transferred to the wastewater collection and treatment system and therefore adds somewhat to the costs of the water company.\nThe value to H&W could be even greater when LATS (Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme) is factored into the equation. The LATS penalty is currently \u00a3150 per tonne of biodegradable municipal waste landfilled in excess of that permitted by allowances held. There could be additional penalties in the target years 2010, 2013 and 2020. The Local Government Association has warned that prices for allowances could be high from 2008/09 onwards, with a \"serious deficit\" of allowances potentially arising after 2009/10.\nWater companies are understandably concerned about changes that might adversely affect demands on water resources or that would increase sewer blockages; field trials in several countries (none has yet been undertaken in the UK) have shown that FWD do not affect water usage or accumulation in sewers significantly. Wastewater treatment works (WwTW) are designed to treat biodegradable material suspended in water, i.e. similar to the output of FWD. Ground KFW has been found actually to improve the composition of wastewater for the advanced nutrient removal processes that are now being demanded of WwTW (this is because it has more carbon in relation to nitrogen or phosphorus than normal sewage). The additional cost for water companies depends on the route for treating and using or disposing the sewage sludge; for the route most usual in H&W it would be about \u00a30.68 per household*year, this is only 4% of the cost of the MSW-landfill route. However, the cost could be as much as \u00a38.38 for a WwTW that incinerates its sludge and does not generate electricity (not the case in the H&W area).\nOverall, food waste disposers appear to be a very cost effective means of separating putrescible kitchen waste at source and diverting it from landfill. The carbon footprint of FWD feeding to a WwTW with anaerobic digestion (AD) and electricity generation (CHP)3 is competitive with separate collection of KFW delivering to centralised AD with CHP and significantly better than centralised composting. They are convenient and hygienic for householders but do not discourage home composting. They avoid the problems of odour and vermin that can be associated with separate collection via the solid waste route.\nStephan\nKendall Christiansen wrote:\nPer Anne\u2019s comment/request, at http://www.insinkerator.com/environmental.shtml you will find six contemporary studies \u2013 beginning with the UWisconsin study (\u201998) which Carol Diggelman conducted (later published in \u201cWaste Management and Research\u201d) and ending with last year\u2019s report (exec summary) on the \u201cSink Your Waste\u201d initiative in Herefordshire/Worcestershire County cited in the WSJ article \u2013 along with some commentaries.\u00a0 The study from\nSydney\nalso independently assessed four options for food scrap management.\u00a0 Additional studies and commentaries are available from me, upon request, as is a comprehensive document summarizing findings \u2013 by topic, to make it easy to find particular answers \u2013 from seventeen (17) studies, for those who really want to dive into this topic.\nMight be worth noting that in the\nU.S.\nfood waste disposers daily divert millions of tons of food scraps from solid waste collection, transport and disposal systems.\u00a0 Probably fair to say that even in the Bay Area that disposers daily divert a significant amount of residential food scraps \u2013 and have done so for decades.\u00a0 After all, not much difference between food and human waste \u2013 both @ 70% water, with similar chemical composition.\u00a0\u00a0 Plenty of studies of impacts/benefits re wastewater treatment systems, but there\u2019s also substantial evidence in the form of the \u2018wisdom of crowds\u2019 of nearly all municipalities in the\nU.S.\nhaving chosen to allow disposers for decades.\u00a0 Dave Biddle\u2019s\nPhiladelphia\nis one such example, where commercial disposers have been encouraged for @ 15 years, in part to reduce odors and vermin caused by food waste stored in dumpsters.\nBut the point of the WSJ article is that where disposers are not common for historical reasons, and pressure is growing to find effective answers, that municipalities are now making informed judgments/decisions about how best to manage food scraps, with some choosing to trade investment in/reliance upon wastewater treatment plants and biosolids processing for truck-based collection and the challenge/cost of siting/operating composting facilities.\u00a0 The article didn\u2019t mention it, but that\u2019s essentially the analysis that led NYC in 1997 \u2013 after a decade of study \u2013 to fully permit residential disposers (previously legal only in newer areas), and is now in the midst of studying the efficacy of commercial disposers for the same purpose, albeit with a new imperative:\u00a0 of reducing GHG emissions from whatever system is pursued, vs. continuing to ship 5,000 TPD of residential and commercial food waste to distant landfills.\nAs to Dan\u2019s concern about sewer overflows, that issue exists with or without disposers; the added flow from disposers is less than 1% per daily household water consumption/generation.\u00a0 In mass balance terms, using NYC as an example, its WWTPs daily handle @ 1.3 billion gpd; if ALL 3 million homes had and used a disposer, the added flow would be perhaps 5 million gpd, or a de minimis impact \u2013 in the words of NYC\u2019s study.\nKendall Christiansen\nSent: Thursday, February 28, 2008 6:52 PM\nTo:\nCc: Dan Knapp; Kendall Christiansen; GreenYes@no.address\nSubject: Re: [GreenYes] Re: Growing Global Interest in Food Waste Disposers\nGood dialogue.\nNote that the WSJ article, which I read, was not a glib endorsement but really just a descriptive report of what's happening in\nMalmo\n"}, {"score": 751.4314, "uuid": "5d9424ad-5b6d-559b-ac0c-6b27255d064a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1702wb-15-09901", "target_hostname": "plasticsandtheplanet.com", "target_uri": "http://plasticsandtheplanet.com/archives/212", "page_rank": 1.2287268e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Papermate Plant a Pen Challenge | Plastics <em>and</em> <em>the</em> Planet", "snippet": "Home composting&#x2F;<em>biodegradable</em> products can be a great way to teach kids about <em>the</em> <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> a <em>biodegradable</em> plastic <em>and</em> a <em>non</em>-degradable plastics.", "explanation": null, "document": "Papermate Plant a Pen Challenge\nBy Miriam Wilcox-Barsalou,on August 20th,2010\nCompanies are starting to understand the impact their material choices have on the environment. Papermate,known as a pen manufacturer,has recently come out with a pen with components that will biodegrade in about a year when buried in soil or placed in an industrial compost facility. These pens,known as Papermate Biodegradable ,require some user disassembly before disposal.\nThe biodegradable components of the pen are molded using a material branded Mirel . It is a biodegradable corn-based bioplastic made from renewable resources. Mirel is a PHA\u00a0 (polyhydroxyalkanoate) plastic as opposed to the better known PLA .\nFrom the Mirel Website :\nMirel resins are biodegradable plastics made from sugar,and like most other bioplastics and organic matter,that are not designed to biodegrade in landfills,but they will biodegrade in natural soil and water environments,home composting systems,and industrial composting\u00a0facilities where these facilities are available.\nPapermate claims that the biodegradable casing will degrade in approximately a year. Considering that the Niagara region composting initiative has been recommending that residents throw the 14 week composting Sunchip bag into the trash because it takes too long for their process,I\u2019m not sure how existing industrial composting facilities will react to the new product.\nOther existing issues will be that the user needs to disassemble the pen before disposal. The ink cartridge and grip are non-biodegradable and need to find their way to a landfill. And the pen casing will not biodegrade in landfills.\nSo in communities such as mine,the user will have to show initiative and either bury or compost their own pens. I can imagine the day a office assistant is caught by a police officer in a\u00a0 digging holes in a park \u201cI\u2019m just burying the company pens Sir.\u201d\nGet the Kids involved\nHome composting/biodegradable products can be a great way to teach kids about the differences between a biodegradable plastic and a non-degradable plastics. I would recommend performing the following experiment using a pen that has not been disassembled so the children can see the difference between the \u201cpermanent\u201dplastic and the biodegradable plastic. The regular plastic stays with us for a very very long time and simply ends up taking space in landfills.\nHere\u2019s an experiment for the kids posted by PR-Canada\nIt\u2019s called the Paper Mate Plant-A-Pen Challenge.

Consider a tree that falls in a forest. Microrganisms or biota slowly consume the tree and eventually the entire tree biodegrades into humus. The leaves are the first to break down into mulch, then the smaller limbs, followed by the larger limbs. The last part of the tree to degrade is the trunk of the tree. It might take several years, but the process is done with no special outside controls such as in composting. Composting requires constant high temperatures, aeration, and moisture levels. Any imbalance of these three and degradation stops. It is not a action done by nature and therefore is not biodegradation in its true sense.\nPosted 2 days ago\nAnonymous...\nHi\nI am just wondering if you polute just as much when you incinerate biodegradable plastic as when you incinerate normal plastic??\nIn Denmark we recycle between 30-35% of our waste but we incinerate 60% (generating energy used for heating of the houses).

Don't forget your camera-see second tip.\nBreathe easy\nAvoid using products which give off toxic or harmful fumes in the winter when there's less ventilation inside. Cleaning solvents, paints, stains and even personal care products give off fumes. Choose low VOC (volatile organic compound) alternatives.\nPain in the...plastic\nAlmost everything you buy new is packaged in plastic, often the clear, molded kind that is nearly impossible-and sometimes painful-to remove (that seems to be the point). Of course, minimal packaging is preferred, but much plastic packaging is recyclable. Look for a recycling symbol with a number 1 through 7 and then check with your waste hauler or local government to see if they collect this type.

Looking at heating capacity is a starting point, but you'll need to consider other factors to size your stove properly.\nThe actual heating capacity of any woodstove varies widely, and depends on the fuel (species of wood and how well seasoned), manner of burning (lots of air or damped down), and how well your house retains heat.\nTesting labs use a standardized fuel and technique to determine their heat output ratings. These ratings assume that:\nYour house is well insulated\nYou have an average amount and type of windows\nYour ceilings are average height\nWinters where you live are moderate\nYou burn only well-seasoned, dry wood with the draft wide open.\nIf you have a drafty or under-insulated house, high or cathedral ceilings, or lots of glass, the amount of heat required to keep your house warm will increase.\nThe severity of winters in your area also matters. Identical homes on Long Island and in the Adirondacks might need different-sized stoves.\nThe species of wood you burn (or composition of your pellets) will influence how much heat your stove can produce.

Again, we want to express our sincerest and most heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has sent cards, well-wishes and those life-saving prayers to Larry! We return home on Friday evenings to get as much routine work completed as possible before returning to the hospital on Sunday evenings and when we traveled the\nAA Highway\nlast Sunday in the daylight, it was totally mind boggling to view the path of destruction that the tornado had made the previous Friday! For many years we burned wood as our primary source of heat which means that we are quite familiar with how stubborn some trees can be to cut down and how hard it is to split some of that wood. To see those trees in the path of the tornado with their tops just broken out while others were uprooted all together, really makes it difficult to wrap one\u2019s brain around the idea of a wind with such force that it can snap trees like toothpicks! We continue to pray for all the victims of the tornado with wishes for brighter days ahead and some sense of normality returning soon to their daily lives!\nOur routine has been anything but normal lately and we again express our sincerest gratitude to the County Road Department crew for taking over our recycling duties! If anyone has any questions or concerns about the recycling trailers or the roll-off dumpsters, please contact the Judge Executive Office of Earl Bush to alert him or Tina to any problems. It is most difficult for us at this time and we appreciate the efforts of everyone who has in some way lightened our burden and made any aspect of our lives less stressful!\nMany of you are living with stress as you follow the NCAA Basketball Tournament whether you are UK Wildcat fans, or a fan of one of the many other major colleges. We recently read that from Feb.5 through March 31 at least 605 colleges will be participating in \u201cRecycleMania\u201d a contest held each year in conjunction with the NCAA Tournament to get colleges to increase the amount of recycling. Last year over 91 million pounds of material were composted or recycled, so organizers are hoping for that number to jump this year. Another interesting college fact comes from\nMichigan\nState\nUniversity\nwhere researchers have found that concrete mixed with waste glass is stronger, more durable and more resistant to water. The cement contains 20% of finely ground waste glass, which creates a somewhat lighter colored concrete. The concrete is improved, less energy is needed to produce the milled glass making this one very positive way to use waste glass and keep it out of landfills.\nWhile we try our best to keep items from the landfills, we sometimes have no choice as the case with used, outdated or no longer wanted TVs. Several of you have inquired recently about the proper disposal for TVs and currently the only solution we have is Rumpke pickup. Rumpke has told us that it is not necessary to call and alert them that a TV will be set out for the weekly pickup, but if the TV is one of the older model, heavy as a house, big screen TV, it might not hurt to give Rumpke a heads up. The number for any Rumpke communication is 877-786-7537 and the workers can take care of any of your needs. For everything other than trash, we encourage you to RECYCLE, REUSE and REDUCE to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful. Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for March 8, 2012\nHowdy Folks! Week four and counting! Thanks so much for the prayers and support we have been receiving for Larry as he continues to be a patient at\nSt.\n,\nEdgewood\n. This past Friday was certainly stressful on everyone and we applaud the nurses and staff as they did their utmost to insure the safety of all their patients and their family members when the tornadoes ripped through\nNorthern Kentucky\n. Blessed by the good Lord, the hospital and everyone inside were safe and sound as the tornado skipped over that particular area, but we know not everyone was so fortunate. Our sincerest sympathy is extended to everyone who sustained any type of damage from this monstrous storm, and we are grateful that no one in our immediate area suffered any physical harm. Let\u2019s hope this is not a precursor of days to come! Friday\u2019s rainbow in the aftermath of the storm reminded us once again that God is with us and that the rainbow is a symbol of His promises to us!\nThe roll-off dumpsters remain in the county and expect them to remain at the\nGermantown\nand Brooksville locations throughout this week. Please follow the rules and regulations as set forth by the Mason County Landfill regarding the use of these dumpsters and do NOT put tires, liquid (including paint), closed drums, hazardous material or brush and trees into the roll-offs. As we stated last week, Commonwealth Cleanup Week kicks off on March 17 and runs through March 24, giving everyone plenty of opportunity to get some serious cleaning done. We urge you to take advantage of this cleanup period to make\nBracken\nCounty\nthe cleanest and most friendly county in the commonwealth!\nMaybe while you are doing all that spring cleaning, you can find items to donate to those who suffered such devastating losses this past Friday evening. It is hard to describe such devastation, and while TV news coverage gives us an idea of the horror of the storm, first hand experience etches the carnage permanently in our minds. There will be many opportunities in the coming weeks to alleviate some of the pain of our fellow Kentuckians and we know that many of you will be right there, doing what you can to help your fellowman. We have given blood to the Red Cross for years, but until a family member is a recipient of that life-giving donation, you really don\u2019t think much about it. The nearly ho-hum procedure of donating blood pales in comparison to the gratitude felt by the one who so desperately needs and receives that life-giving substance! So whether the donation be in the form of money, goods, services or blood, we can assure you that any donation will be a blessing to those in need!\nOn Saturday some of our grandchildren went to the theater to view \u201cThe Lorax\u201d which was written by the famous Dr. Seuss and recently made into an animated movie to be released on the anniversary of the author\u2019s birthday of March 2. This entertaining movie for children and adults alike actually ties in with our message of recycling, reusing, and reducing to save our natural resources! The Lorax was written in 1971 to help readers become more aware of the environment by getting folks to realize the dangers of consumerism in relation to its adverse effect on the environment. Children learn so much from us and we need to take every opportunity to discuss the importance of RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for March 1, 2012\nHowdy Folks! Wow! Two whole months of 2012 are history already, we\u2019ve barely had winter (NOT complaining), the daffodils and crocuses are blooming or right on the verge, the Lenten season has started and we are into our third week at St. Elizabeth Hospital Edgewood with our son Larry! Our sincerest appreciation to everyone who has sent messages of get well and included their prayers for a complete and speedy recovery for Larry! Those of you who have been in our situation understand the power of prayer and while we do not wish this on everyone, we want you to understand that those hurried petitions or the thoughtful conversation with God on Larry\u2019s behalf have been the difference between life and death! May God bless each and every one of you for your concerns and know that we are in your debt, as you are in our prayers!\nDue to this extended hospital stay, we have been unable to perform our job as we are accustomed, especially the recycling aspect, and we ask for your patience and understanding. Please be our eyes and ears and if you know of a trailer that is full or hear of something that should be done that is not getting done, please call the Judge Executive Office of Earl Bush to alert him or Tina to the problem. The County Road Department hands have been most helpful working on the recycling, but they need your input. Again, we cannot express adequately what living in\nBracken\nCounty\nmeans to us and all our family! If only everyone in the county could feel the overwhelming power of family life and God\u2019s love! This sense of well-being would translate into a pride for the county, evident to residents and strangers alike by how clean and refreshing\nBracken\nCounty\nis kept!\nUnfortunately, some of the roll-offs have not faired so well and we have asked the Mason County Landfill to put chains and locks on the dumpster doors, but it is costly to the county when these dumpsters are mistreated. Last week the Road Department had to take the loader, a dump truck and several men to clean up around the roll-off at the\nJohnsville\nPark\nand Ride just to allow the driver to pick up the roll-off! Please folks \u2013 NO tires and NO overloading of the dumpster! Even though the weather is cooperating, some of our citizens are not and we may have to discontinue the dumpsters if the abuse continues --- cooperation is expected and required if this service is to continue.\nCommonwealth Cleanup Week is scheduled for March 17-24 and as this 14th year of cleanup begins, it will be highlighted on KET\u2019s Dave Shuffett\u2019s Kentucky Life. Dave will be visiting several different counties with his filming crew to demonstrate the importance of keeping\nKentucky\n\u2019s streams, rivers, hollows and roadsides clean of debris and trash as Kentuckians get involved in their community\u2019s cleanup. Our office will be sponsoring the 6th CleanUp Bracken Party and urge all residents to participate in some type of cleanup in order to enter the contest and be in the running for the $100 cash prize random drawing. Due to the lack of environmental concern in the country, a grassroots organization known as Keep America Beautiful began in 1953 and has begged, pleaded, poked and prodded Americans to get on board to keep this home of ours clean. This can be done every day with little effort if we all practice the great habits of RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Feb. 23, 2012\nHowdy Folks! We extend our sincerest appreciation to everyone who has called and sent their prayers and well wishes to our son, Larry. He spent last week in the hospital and currently remains a patient at\nSt.\nin\nEdgewood\n. It is such a blessing to have a large family to step up and help out! As our children grew, they each became adept at caring for their brother and they have in turn taught through their example the care and love of their sibling to their spouses and children. And again, we ask that you keep Larry in your prayers and all those in hospitals. There are several other\nBracken\nCounty\nresidents as patients at St. E\u2019s and, while we do not want them to have to be in the hospital, it sure is good to see familiar faces!\nThe roll-off dumpsters will continue to be rotated around the county as the weather is cooperating. As of today, the second roll-off remains at the Foster location. Once this dumpster is full, it will be relocated to the\nGermantown\nlocation behind the firehouse and before the ball park. The second dumpster at the\nJohnsville\nPark\nand Ride is being removed and relocated to the location on Old 19, just outside of Brooksville. It is on public property and can be accessed by turning down Old 19 at Snappy Pizza. The dumpster is on the right close to the sewage treatment plant. As a reminder, please do not put tires in, around or on the roll-offs. Tires are not an acceptable item and ask that you adhere to the rules and regulations as set forth by the Maysville-Mason County Landfill.\nRecently we had a call concerning the disposal of CFL light bulbs that use less energy to operate. These bulbs do contain a small amount of mercury and require special handling. When these bulbs burn out, put them into a plastic bag and take them to the Returns Department at the Lowe\u2019s Store in Maysville. There is a special collection box for CFL bulbs, another compartment for rechargeable batteries and another for clean plastic bags. In just about every trailer we find a bag filled with plastic bags. We know that folks who put these into the trailers think that that bag of plastic bags is being recycled when, in reality, they are not. The\nMason\nRecycling\nCenter\nis not equipped to handle these bags and their only option is to send them to the landfill. In order to recycle any plastic bags, you must take them to Wal-Mart, Kroger or Lowe\u2019s in Maysville and put them into the special recycling boxes available for specifically recycling the plastic bags.\nA couple of folks have asked about the bubble wrap that is so common in shipping packages. Again, that material is termed \u201cplastic sheeting\u201d and is not recyclable in our area. This material however can be reused. It is a good idea to keep some on hand in case you yourself need to ship something. Of course, it really comes in handy for wrapping dishes and other delicate items when someone moves to a new home or relocates. The purpose of the three r\u2019s is to get folks to think outside the box to keep as many items as possible from going to landfills. As we have mentioned before, the day will come when landfills will be mined to remove the useable, recyclable material.\nWe urge our\nBracken\nCounty\nresidents to be a part of the solution and not the problem by continuing to RECYCLE, REUSE and REDUCE to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful. Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Feb 16, 2012\nHowdy Folks! This message is somewhat belated, but we hope everyone had a great Valentine\u2019s Day! As you all know, this article is written on Monday and this has been another Monday spent in the hospital with our son, Larry. It has been a very difficult year for him so far and we ask that you please keep him in your prayers. Many times we have expressed our appreciation for living in this small community where family, friends and neighbors are always willing to lend a helping hand. Whether you are an old hand at dealing with medical problems or just beginning, it is a whole different world and as we learn the ins and outs of the medical profession, we are grateful for the doctors, nurses and staff at the hospitals and doctors\u2019 office!\nRoll-off dumpsters have been delivered to Foster and Johnsville, and on our way to the hospital Monday morning, we noticed that the Johnsville dumpster was being used. Even though it was a cold weekend, we were happy to see that folks got to the roll-offs. Please remember to fill these dumpsters as evenly as possible so that more trash can be put into the container and more folks can get the use of them.\nWith the days flying by, it won\u2019t be too long until we get our first road clean organized, beginning the last full week in March to be exact. We always like to coordinate this first clean with Commonwealth Cleanup Week and of course, we will be hosting our sixth Annual C.U.B. Party, better known as CleanUp Bracken Week. Those who do any type of outdoor activity are eligible to enter, from age four to eighty-four and beyond! The cash prize of $100 will be presented to the random drawing winner of all entries. With the roll-offs in place during that week, it will make it even easier to \u201cclean up and enter\u201d! The little kids (since they are closer to the ground) can pick up debris in the yard, and age appropriate clean up tasks can be performed from grade school and up. We are looking forward to getting more entries this year and hope that you have already drawn up your clean up plan!\nTaylor Elementary had a plan last week to ensure the safety of their students in case of emergencies. Ms. Bug spoke to the three pre-school classes and while there was able to participate in an earthquake drill, a lock-down drill and a fire drill. With grandchildren in the school, it was very comforting to know that these drills are conducted on a regular basis and with such professionalism. We also congratulate the teachers and staff of the pre-school classes on an excellent teaching job concerning recycling!\nAs we noted, Valentine\u2019s Day has come and gone, but the Farmer\u2019s Almanac told of a married couple who had gone to a Marriage Seminar. They listened intently as the seminar instructor explained that husbands and wives should know each other\u2019s likes and dislikes and asked if the husbands could name their wife\u2019s favorite flower. The young husband touched his wife\u2019s arm proudly and whispered, \u201cIts Pillsbury isn\u2019t it?\u201d We can only hope that he followed that statement up with a bouquet of flowers and not a sack of flour! Our spring flowers are poking their heads through the ground and hope that spring weather is not too far off. As you start your spring cleaning, exercise the good habits of RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Jan. 26, 2012\nHowdy Folks! The wind is really blustery this Monday although the temperature does not reflect the January date! This is the type of day when a lot of trash cans meet their demise on the highway after being tossed about by the weather conditions so the sooner the trash receptacles are removed from the curb, the better! Over the years we have stopped numerous times to remove a stray can from the highway and hopefully saved it from being run over. Blowing cans do present a road hazard on trash day, so keep that in mind especially on Mondays and Thursdays in\nBracken\nCounty\n!\nWe have spoken numerous times in this article about Styrofoam packaging material that always finds its way into the recycling trailers. A recent article in Resource Recycling Magazine described new products made from recycled material including an alternative to Styrofoam which is hard if not impossible to recycle and is made from oil, a natural resource that will someday be non-existent. In\nToronto\n,\nCanada\n, a company by the name of PaperNuts has developed a packing product which is made from 100% recycled paper. This product can also replace packing products manufactured using food based materials like cornstarch which can attract vermin and has a tendency to break down during shipping. Responding to the lack of environmentally sound options for the daily shipping needs of individuals and companies, the PaperNuts are designed to provide a cushy way to protect goods that is itself fully recyclable and compostable. The loose-fill packaging material employs an interlocking configuration, designed to ensure that the PaperNuts sit tightly against the items in the package and because the nuts also expand naturally during shipping, the item being shipped is snug and secure. The web-site www.papernuts.com gives more information on this and other products that the company has to offer, but we didn\u2019t readily find the cost of the material. Hopefully, it will be comparable to the Styrofoam counterpart and will become a standard in the shipping industry!\nAnother very interesting new product made from 100% post-consumer recycled nylon carpet is known as EcoLon and is being used by the Ford automotive giant as cylinder caps in the engines of its Escape, Fusion, Mustang and F-150 models. By using the EcoLon product which is molded into cylinder head covers for the selected models, Ford is diverting 4.1 million pounds of carpet, which is equivalent to 985,000 square yards of carpet, from landfills while keeping 430,000 gallons of oil from being consumed! As we have said before, we expect a lot of great ideas such as these from the students in the public, private and home-schooled settings in the not-to-distant future here in\nBracken\nCounty\n!\nWe send our sincerest appreciation to all of you who have called and/or sent cards regarding the health of our son Larry who spent last week in the hospital. Today, Monday, is Larry\u2019s 39th birthday and as many of you know, he was born with cerebral palsy and has been unable to walk or talk, but that has not stopped him from smiling! He is the spark plug that ignites this family and those of you who know him, would agree! Please continue to keep him in your prayers as he embarks on his 40th year! We also acknowledge and appreciate all of you who recycle on a daily basis. It is your efforts and example that will sustain this planet indefinitely! Keep on exercising those noble habits of RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Jan. 19, 2012\nHowdy Folks! Sometimes it is difficult to get the creative brain cells motivated to write an article and this Monday morning is one of them! Many folks are fortunate to have this as a holiday as we celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King here in the\nUnited States\n. Dr. King was most instrumental in securing the civil liberties for the oppressed, especially for African Americans. As a Baptist minister he used his gift of speech to urge his fellow Americans to non-violently protest segregation and discrimination against people of color. Due to Dr. King\u2019s dedicated work for the cause of civil liberties, he made many enemies and in 1968 an assassin\u2019s bullet cut short the life of this fearless leader. Many of you remember the strife and civil unrest of the sixties and we are thankful that the cause did not die with Dr. King and that eventually, all Americans were given the rights they deserved. Now, we need to get the Roe v. Wade decision overturned so that all Americans can be given back the right to life!\nThe first paragraph of this article was written early morning, and it is now late Monday afternoon. Because our son Larry has not been feeling well, we contacted his doctor who advised us to take him to the hospital for observation and some I.V. fluids. For every medical professional we extend our sincerest appreciation and pray that all patients get well soon!\nRecently, we have talked a lot about recycling and we became curious about the recycling symbol itself. A \u201cGoogle search\u201d stated that Gary Dean Anderson, at the time a\nUniversity\nof\nSouthern California\nstudent, actually created the chasing arrows recycling symbol which is as well known today as the Coca Cola, McDonald\u2019s and Nike brand symbols. In April of 1970 the very first Earth Day was held in which Mr. Anderson participated and became acutely aware of the finite supply of natural resources. Folks were beginning to realize that natural resources would eventually run out and this realization became the starting point for the environmental movement. Later in that year,\nAnderson\nwas one of 500 contestants in a contest sponsored by Container Corporation of\nAmerica\nwho was the largest user of recycled fiber in the\nU.S.\nat that time. The contest challenged environmentally-concerned art and design students to create a design that would symbolize the paper recycling process.\nThe design of the symbol was to be used to identify packages made from recycled and recyclable fibers, and to call attention to paper recycling as an effective method of conservation of our natural resources. Even though Container Corporation of\nAmerica\nwas the largest user of recycled material at the time and had corporate designers on staff, they felt that a contest for students from the younger generation as inheritors of the earth would be the best source for the new design. In the seventies, computers were just in the infant stages and all graphic designs were created by hand with pen and pencil and not with computer programs! While it took several years for the design to catch on, it is used universally today and Mr. Anderson has led a most successful career in the architecture and design field.\nOur\nBracken\nCounty\nschools in both Augusta and Brooksville are filled with bright and creative students who one day may make an equally impressive impact on society and be inspired by their participation in RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Jan. 5, 2012\nHowdy Folks! It sure is hard typing \u20182012\u2019! What happened to \u20182011\u2019? Did anyone follow through with their 2011 New Year\u2019s Resolution? If not, take heart! The New Year is here and we can make that resolution again this year and maybe even carry it out for a few more weeks than we did last year! The really important point to remember is that each day is a gift, a chance to make each day better than the day before and to give thanks to God for the \u2018present\u2019! Our sincere prayers and best wishes to everyone for a New Year filled with much happiness, good health and prosperity!\nLooking back on the old year we feel a sense of accomplishment for the citizens of\nBracken\n. Our nine recycling trailers generated 288,220 pounds of recycling taken to the\nMason\nRecycling\nCenter\nin 318 trips for an average of a little more than 906 pounds per trip. Those figures are down from the previous year, but we picked up a tremendous amount of cardboard from the renovation of the Bracken Creek Apartment buildings in 2010. We anticipate another jump this year as we will be working with Mr. Bob Bogardus of Baker Concrete Construction, Inc., the contracting company for the Meldahl Hydroelectric Project. The crews will be recycling paper, plastic, glass, aluminum and cardboard during their work period here in\nBracken\nCounty\n. We haven\u2019t had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Bogardus yet, but through our phone, e-mail and written correspondence, we look forward to working with the company for the next two years.\nBracken\nCounty\ncitizens disposed of 102.35 tons of garbage during April and May thanks to the collaborative efforts of Donna Rath, Administrative Secretary for the Bracken County Soil Conservation District and Bracken County Solid Waste Management. Donna wrote and obtained a $7500 grant to be used for cleaning outside areas around homes and farms and we worked with Mason County Landfill to obtain the 26 roll-offs. Even though tires were not an allowable item for the roll-offs, there were 126 put in at a cost of $189. Donna happily informed us that she has again obtained this grant for the county, so start preparing now for spring clean-up! Don\u2019t forget our fifth Annual C.U.B. Party which will be held the last full week of March, the 25th thru the 31st.\nAnother huge accomplishment for us this year was the removal of approximately 15,495 waste tires by the Division of Waste Management from two tire dumps on the Mini Farms Road. Property owners inherited these tires from previous owners and were most happy to be rid of them. Our efforts started in 2006 to get these tires removed and because of unfiled paper work in Frankfort, we were basically on the \u2018forgotten list\u2019 until we approached the Division again in the spring of 2010 when they began making plans for the 2010 Tire Amnesty. All is well now and all those tires have been recycled! (We haven\u2019t forgotten the efforts of our Bracken County Litter Patrol, but all those figures are not compiled!)\nWe are proud of\nBracken\nCounty\nresidents and all that, together as a community, we have accomplished in the year 2011! Our goal to exceed 2 million pounds of recycling to\nMason\nRecycling\nCenter\nsince we became Solid Waste Coordinator in 2004 was reached with the grand total from 2004 thru 2011 standing at 2,085,070 pounds!\nCongratulations\nBracken\nCounty\n!! Ms. Beulah and Mr. Troy Fields left us a Christmas card with the message: \u201cThank you for your dedication for a cleaner world. God bless you and yours!\u201d And to each of you, we extend the same message!! Thank you for your dedication for a cleaner world through your efforts of RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Dec. 29, 2011\nHowdy Folks! Just a few more hours and 2011 will be history! 2011 flew by, but yet looking back on it, so much happened. We sincerely hope that your joys will be boundless and your troubles few as we welcome in 2012! Predictions abound that this will be the year that the world ends, but we have heard all that before and know that it is in God\u2019s hands. From the cradle we have been taught to live each day as if it were our last and when the hand of the Lord reaches out for us, we will always be ready! If these predictions do anything, we hope that it nudges us to do more good for those less fortunate and to serve our God with joyful anticipation of things to come!\nWinter officially began last Thursday and so far it has behaved itself very nicely. December of 2010 found the children being dismissed from school several times due to snow and the entire winter (or what we remember of it!) seemed to be one endless snow after another! The good side of that was that our trash accumulation was not so visible along the roadways, unlike this year! Our final road clean was in late October, and already the roads have sprouted trash like so many weeds that appear mysteriously in gardens! As with most of our admonishments, we know we are preaching to the choir, but if you know of anyone who makes littering a habit, please let them know that it is unacceptable. Littering is ugly, unhealthy and costs taxpayers millions of dollars annually to just make a dent in the volume! This week as you go about work, appointments, shopping or sightseeing, take notice of the litter and resolve to be a part of the solution and not the problem!\nMaybe you are between jobs and have some time on your hands, or you can spare a few minutes each day, how about volunteering to pick up trash? It need not be a large amount, but if every able-bodied citizen could pick up just a little, the roads would look so much better and the earth would benefit tremendously from the removal of all those bottles and cans. It is safe to say that these cans and bottles will be around for eternity. We read recently that every piece of plastic that was ever manufactured is still in existence, whether it be in a landfill or recycled into another product. It is so very important that we all recycle and reuse all that plastic to conserve the oil from which these products have their origin. It won\u2019t be in our lifetime, but sometime these pockets of oil will eventually be depleted and our descendents will encounter mind-boggling challenges to maintain a quality of life. So lets all do our part! Let\u2019s make a New Year\u2019s resolution to recycle and give the gift of a happier and healthier future to our descendents!\nWe\u2019ve never looked up the statistic, but it is probably safe to say that nearly everyone makes some type of positive resolution. With the taste of all the holiday goodies still lingering in our mouths, and our waistbands crying out for some room, many folks will tackle the battle of the bulge for the new year, while others may resolve to go to church every Sunday, not just on special occasions or when it is convenient. Whatever your resolution, may your New Year be the best ever and may you develop the good habits of RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you in 2012 \u2014\nBin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Dec. 22, 2011\nHowdy Folks! In our Christmas article last year we were anxiously awaiting the birth of our 19th grandchild and because of the forecast of heavy snow, we were hoping she would not arrive on Christmas Eve. Well, she did and all our worries were erased when we arrived at the hospital on Christmas Eve morning to greet little Miss Colbie Michelle Jefferson. As with all our children and grandchildren, she has grown up too fast as she officially turns one at 12:20 AM Christmas Eve! Many folks think that Christmas is not a good time to have a birthday, but who better than the Savior of the world to share a birthday with? Grandson Joseph turns nine on Tuesday, granddaughters Emma celebrated the big seven on the 5th and Madeline turned eleven on the 14th and Aunt Jeanna remains ageless, but happy to celebrate on the 21st1!\nArea birthday calendars are filled with December birthdays and anniversaries and we congratulate and extend best wishes to each and every one of you, but along with those celebrations, we have commemorations. Our own family has experienced the death of a loved one during the Christmas season this year, as well as in years past. We understand the pain felt from the loss of those loved ones regardless of the calendar date, but we rejoice that God has chosen this very special time of year to include some loved ones in heaven\u2019s \u201cbig\u201d birthday celebration of Jesus\u2019 birth! All the pain, anxieties and heartaches of this life are gone and those dear loved ones are so at peace and so happy in their eternal home! Even though we miss them terribly, we feel their presence and take comfort in the fact that their Christmas joy is complete in the arms of our Creator.\nIt seems we work all year toward the big end-of-the year Christmas celebration but to really enjoy Christmas, we must first have the love in our hearts that comes from the Infant whose birth we are celebrating! As children, the time between Christmases was almost unbearable! Usually the week of Christmas, Daddy would cut down the cedar tree that would become the decorated delight of us kids! Those strands of C7 bulbs, a few shining ornaments, a homemade aluminum foil star for the top of the tree and the icicles carefully stored away from the previous year\u2019s tree created a truly magical time for many children growing up in the fifties! There may not have been many presents, but back then, those two or three gifts meant so much, and it was always impossible to catch that busy Santa to thank him for stopping!\nWith most Moms at home shopping from catalogs, those childhood Christmas days were filled with anticipation and much excitement, but it was a relaxed and joyful time that created memories to last a lifetime! Our Christmas prayer is that in some small way, that spirit of Christmas can find its way into the very busy and cluttered lives of today\u2019s families! We pray that the big corporations, government regulations and poor economic times don\u2019t dampen and heaven forbid, snatch the true meaning of Christmas from us! We celebrate Christmas because over 2000 years ago a babe was born in a humble stable who was the Son of God and Savior of mankind! Blessings to all for a most beautiful and peaceful Christmas! As God has given us many gifts, let us in return give back to secure the future of mankind by RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you and Merry Christmas \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Dec. 15, 2011\nHowdy Folks! One more week and we will be staring Old Man Winter in the eye! These past cold mornings are preparing us for the winter months which hopefully won\u2019t be as snowy as last! We appreciate our warm clothing, knowing that there are many folks who aren\u2019t as fortunate. If anyone has any gently used, unwanted coats, the St. Augustine Confirmation class is collecting coats, non-perishable food and health/hygiene items as part of their project to help the poor, but they need to be dropped off at St. Augustine School by week\u2019s end. Being born in a stable, Jesus understands how difficult life can be and blesses especially those who care for and support the less fortunate.\nChristmas is just around the corner and if you haven\u2019t decorated already, chances are, that is on your \u201cto do\u201d list for this week. If your Christmas lights are like ours, even though they were working when you stored them away, there are always a few strands that somehow lost their ability to light up! Now, what are we to do with those non functioning strands? Rather than throwing them away, we can recycle these frustrating strands of non functioning lights at the Maysville Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement Store! No bulbs have to be removed, no special treatment, just stuff the strands into a bag, take it to the Returns Department and put it into the bin especially for those uncooperative strands of lights from Christmases Past!\nNot only is there a bin for those annoying lights, but there are also bins in the Returns Department for plastic bags, CFL bulbs and rechargeable batteries! None of these items can be placed in the nine recycling trailers located throughout\nBracken\nCounty\n, but any Lowe\u2019s store has the facility and ability to recycle them! We might also add that the Kroger and Wal-Mart stores in Maysville collect and recycle clean plastic bags. Those bins are located in the lobbies of the respective stores and we encourage everyone to take advantage of bag recycling. Many, many bags of plastic bags are put into the trailers and we used to try to retrieve them to drop off at the Maysville locations, but there were so many that it became an impossible task. Plastic bag recycling is important and we depend on you to get this mission accomplished! Individual stewardship is also required to deliver the compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) to any Lowe\u2019s location.\nBracken\nCounty\nOffice of Solid Waste Management recycles regular household batteries, rechargeable batteries and the tool or appliance that needed that battery, but again, DO NOT put them into the recycling trailers! These items need to be dropped off at our office next to the County Maintenance Barn. Household batteries can be stored in a small plastic bag or coffee can and left at our office when full. The company that picks up computers and other e-scrap also recycles the batteries for us.\nCertainly many calendars are full of reminders to go here, there and everywhere and do this, that and the other, but we hope you can find some time to actually enjoy whatever it is that you are doing! Remember that Jesus is the reason for the season and that whatever we do will be most rewarding when we do it to express our love for Him through our treatment of others! Taking care of the earth expresses our attitude of gratitude and is best done through RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Dec. 8, 2011\nHowdy Folks! At 12:30 AM, December 8, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his Presidential Address to Congress. In those early morning hours on this date 70 years ago, President Roosevelt\u2019s speech to a joint session of Congress has become what is regarded as one of the most famous American political speeches of the twentieth century. One day after the Empire of Japan\u2019s attack on Pearl Harbor Naval Base,\nHawaii\n, President Roosevelt described the events of, and the previous day \u2018\u2026as a date which will live in infamy.\u2019 Within one hour of the speech, Congress passed a formal declaration of war against\nJapan\nand officially brought the\nUnited States\ninto World War II. Many of you still remember that date and all the sacrifices made by the American people to sustain us in the war and the many, many men and women who sacrificed their very life in order for\nAmerica\nto remain a free country. Probably every family in\nBracken\nlost a loved one because of\nJapan\n\u2019s actions on December 7, 1941, and we appreciate all those many sacrifices and pray that God will bless and continue to protect this land of the free, and the home of the brave!\nGranted, this is the home of the brave, but our nation\u2019s highways are becoming the battlefront for the land of the brave motorists! This has been a record-setting year for rainfall which means that all the motorists have had numerous days of rain, gloomy conditions and fog as companions on their daily commute to and from work. It is amazing how many vehicles do not have any type of lights on to alert other drivers of their presence on the road! Lots of vehicles are equipped with day time running lights which are great, but please check to make sure when these unpleasant companions of dangerous weather conditions are along for the ride that the vehicles\u2019 lights are on. These lights certainly don\u2019t help the driver to see, but they sure let un-coming drivers know that you are there! We want everyone to be safe and just a flick of the light switch can and will save lives! Using that turn signal gadget will too, but that\u2019s a story for another day!\nWith the December days flying by, we need to remind you of the holiday schedule of the\nMason\nRecycling\nCenter\n. Closing dates for Christmas are Dec. 24 and 26 and for New Year\u2019s, the Center will be closed Dec. 30 and Jan. 2, 2012, which means that the week after Christmas, the Center will only be open for three days. We will try to maintain our schedule as best we can, but if your favorite trailer is not in its location during the holidays, we apologize for the inconvenience, but don\u2019t give up on recycling! The winter months can sometimes create a challenge to maintain normal trailer rotations and deliveries to the Center, but again, we do the best we can and appreciate your patience and understanding. Of course, if the weather is too bad for us to get to the trailers, then, most likely, you won\u2019t be able to either! This is our eight winter as Solid Waste Coordinator and we have learned that eventually the weather clears, spring arrives and everything returns to \u201cnormal\u201d!\nMany times life\u2019s circumstances force us to adjust to create a new \u201cnormal\u201d but we hope that adjustment continues to include the good habits of RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Dec. 1, 2011\nHowdy Folks! Thanksgiving has come and gone and we sincerely hope that everyone was able to enjoy the day with their family and friends! Our house was full, and by 3 PM, everyone in it was full! We shared a most blessed day and are most thankful for all the time together with our 18 grandchildren, 8 children with 7 spouses, sister Lynda with husband Bo and their 3 children! Now we anticipate Christmas and Brooksville\u2019s Christmas Parade which will be held this Saturday. Congratulations and best wishes are extended to Hal and Maude Teegarden and Ron and Phyllis Thornbury as Grand Marshalls for this year\u2019s parade! Both are very deserving couples having spent many hours working toward the betterment of\nBracken\nCounty\nand quietly setting the standard of good citizens. We respect their combined hard work and are proud of their many accomplishments!\nIt is time once again to begin reviewing this old year with all its ups and downs to determine how we can improve on the New Year. Perhaps 2012 is THE year to develop a recycling program at home and in the work place. First and foremost you need to make the commitment to follow through with your decision; next you need a sheet explaining the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of recycling and finally you will need a container for the recycling material. We can encourage and support you with your commitment and can provide the instruction and educational components, but the container and actual recycling will be up to you! If you can just start recycling a couple of items such as plastic bottles and aluminum cans, it won\u2019t take long for that habit to become second nature and the other recyclable items will be a breeze! If anyone needs any literature, give us a call and we will be happy to oblige!\nWith the approaching gift-giving season, we remind you that Christmas wrap is not recyclable in our area. Flattened boxes, gift bags and the white tissue paper can be recycled along with brown packing paper and newspaper, but absolutely, positively, NO STYROFOAM of any size, shape or color! There are many researchers working to reverse the process so that Styrofoam and other plastic of lesser quality can once again become viable oil that can be used to fuel vehicles, but perfecting the reversal technique may take a few years. In the meantime, we need to get as many folks on board recycling as possible so that the recycling material will be readily available once the scientists provide a workable and affordable solution!\nPerhaps one of you can provide us with a workable solution to the problem of boxes in the recycling trailers that have not been broken down or flattened! Try as we may, it is impossible for us to keep up with all the boxes that are put into the trailers without being flattened. Some of these boxes have to be brought in pickups to the trailers because there is no way that they could fit into cars or even some of the SUVs\u2019. We are not scientists, nor do we play one on TV, but it only makes sense that a box consumes less storage space when flattened as opposed to a whole box. If you have any pity or compassion for these two old people, please break down the boxes! You will have our eternal gratitude! Also, our sincerest gratitude to everyone who has made the long-term commitment to RECYCLE, REUSE and REDUCE to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug!\nTrash Talk for Nov. 24, 2011\nHowdy Folks! And Happy Thanksgiving Day! On this day we sit back to count all our blessings and dwell on the positives of our lives, not the negatives! There are 364 other days in the year to do that, which most of us take full advantage of! Just for today, if you are able to open your eyes, know that it is the present (time) and know that it is also the present (gift) from God! Far too often, we take for granted that we will be given our next breath, when far too often this past year for many friends, family and fellow citizens, that next moment never came! So just for Thanksgiving Day, before your feet ever touch the floor, thank God for the present and enjoy every minute of it!\nAs Bracken County Solid Waste Coordinator, we are extremely happy and thankful that the two tire dumps on Mini Farms have been cleaned to the tune of nearly 15,500 tires sent to be recycled! It has been five years since we notified the Division of Waste Management of the first tire dump and in that time were alerted to the other one in the same vicinity. These tires not only were creating a breeding ground for mosquitoes, but clogging up the steams, devaluing the land, and wrecking havoc on Mother Nature.\nWe appreciate the many good citizens who want to recycle in order to conserve and preserve a future for their children and grandchildren. Folks don\u2019t get any type of compensation for the time and effort they take to properly recycle other than having the peace of mind and good conscience of knowing that their actions will make this a better world today and for many tomorrows to come. A recent report by the BlueGreen Alliance in conjunction with several other environmental groups stated that if the recycling rate in\nAmerica\nwould reach 75%, it would create 1.5 million jobs with a lot less pollution.\nBracken\nCounty\nresidents are working toward that goal and doing all they can, even though the products that can be recycled in our area are limited.\nOur nearly 175 County road miles and 166 State road miles are looking less trashy and a little more inviting to home folks and visitors as many travelers hit the roads in search of that delicious Thanksgiving Dinner! We appreciate the hard work that our Bracken County Litter Patrol does to keep the litterbugs from getting the upper hand! If we could just convince the litterbugs to become recyclers, our problems with litter would be eradicated!\nIt would be nice to eradicate hunger in the world on this Thanksgiving Day! Even though there will be 45 million turkeys eaten on Thanksgiving Day according to the USDA, there are one billion people hungry each and every day worldwide. A lot of times we use the word \u2018starving\u2019 too loosely. While we may not have everything we would like to eat, as long as there are brown beans and cornbread to put on the table, we will not starve! For the gift of food, wonderful family and friends, clothes on our backs, a roof over our head, sun on our shoulders, life in the country, work for our hands and the good Lord watching over us, we are THANKFUL! May each and every one of you be as blessed as we are! While we miss those who have gone before us, especially on the holidays, we are thankful and so very blessed for the new friends and new family members that come into our lives to keep us busy and keep us aware that life needs to be lived, in the present and in accordance with God\u2019s plans! We are thankful for a community that RECYCLES, REDUCES and REUSES to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Nov. 17, 2011\nHowdy Folks! In 2004, President George W. Bush issued a presidential proclamation declaring November 15 as America Recycles Day. Its purpose is to encourage all Americans to recycle and to buy products made from recycled material. This date has its origins in\nTexas\ndating back to 11/15/1997, when the\nLone\nStar\nState\nbegan to encourage its residents to conserve natural resources by educating and motivating communities to take part in recycling with the idea that recycling would become a daily habit. Recycling has become the most successful environmental initiative in our country\u2019s history. In 1960 the composting and recycling rate nationwide was at 7.7%, increasing by another 10% in 1990 with the current rate at 34%. While this is very encouraging, as a nation, we have a long way to go! According to the EPA, 78% of glass containers, 60% of aluminum cans, 41% of steel cans and 45% of paper products are NOT recycled annually! There are a lot of numbers in this paragraph, but it boils down to the fact that Americans need to increase their recycling efforts!\nConsider these facts: Each man, woman and child uses enough products to produce 4.4 pounds of waste per day which can either be recycled or land filled. Each typical family in one year consumes 104 gallons of milk, 29 gallons of juice, 26 gallons of bottled water, 182 gallons of soda and uses 680 pounds of paper products! All that liquid comes in containers that can be recycled but Americans have not even reached the 50% mark of recycling! So again, with all the numbers, individuals need to make the commitment to become a part of the solution and not the problem!\nBracken\nresidents were responsible for 170 tons of recycling material that we delivered to the\nMason\nRecycling\nCenter\nin 2010. The numbers are down for this year so far, but part of that is due to the fact that we were able to recycle a lot of cardboard last year from the Bracken Creek Apartment complex that was completely remodeled. The contractor called us on a regular basis to come and load the cardboard from appliances, cabinets, fixtures, etc. If you have a major remodeling job or a new building project that has a lot of cardboard, give us a call and we will pick it up. Also, if you have any questions concerning the recyclability of an item, give us a call. Lots of folks have and we appreciate that and really wish more folks would call us, especially those related to plastic recycling.\nEach of the recycling trailers has instructions on them and if an item is not listed, it is pretty safe to say that it is not recyclable. Last week we again retrieved more vinyl siding from the\nTaylor\ntrailer and what appeared to be red guttering from the trailer at the\nAugusta\nBall\nPark\n. We understand the reasoning behind these products because they are plastic, but not all plastic can be recycled in this area. The largest plastic items that the\nMason\nRecycling\nCenter\ncurrently accepts are the five gallon buckets with the #1 or the #2 inside the recycling emblem on the bottom of the product. In years to come, we anticipate the center to grow as the populations of the surrounding counties grow and items once considered non-acceptable will become part of the center\u2019s commodities. We also anticipate in years to come the majority accepting the necessity of RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Nov. 10, 2011\nHowdy Folks! Friday is Veterans Day, a day set aside to honor and remember all are men and women who gave their time and some their very life so that we may enjoy our free society. Last week\nBracken\nCounty\nlost another WWII veteran when Mr. Tommy McClanahan passed away at the age of 91. Like many fellow\nBracken\nCounty\nveterans, Mr. Tommy served his country, came home, raised his family and quietly got on with his life. Our sincerest sympathy is extended to his wife of 67 years, Wilma, and his entire family. The rest of this article has been condensed from the one published in the Bracken Co News in November of 2007 and the original article was condensed from an e-mail sent by daughter Angela.\nIn 2005 social studies teacher, Martha Cothren, from a high school in\nArkansas\ndid something memorable for her students. With permission Ms. Cothren had all the desks removed from her classroom on the first day of school. Of course the students were quite confused and wanted to know the location of their desks. Ms. Cothren told them they could not have a desk until \u201cyou tell me what you have done to earn the right to sit at a desk.\u201d As the social study classes came and went throughout the day, no one offered the correct reply from their prestigious positions on the floor.\nBy early afternoon TV news crews had started gathering to report on this crazy teacher. Finally, the last class of the day had taken their \u201cfloor\u201d seats, and Ms. Cothren told them, \u201cThroughout the day, no one has been able to tell me just what he/she has done to earn the right to sit at the desks that are ordinarily found in this classroom. Now I\u2019m going to tell you.\u201d As the classroom door opened, 27 U.S. Veterans, all in dress uniform, walked into that classroom, each carrying a school desk which he placed neatly in a row. Each veteran then stood at attention alongside the wall and with the final desk in place, perhaps for the first time in their young lives, these students began to understand just how the right to sit in those desks had been earned.\nMartha Cothren said, \u201cYOU didn\u2019t earn the right to sit at these desks. These heroes did it for you! Now it is up to you to sit in them. It is your responsibility to learn, to be good students, to be good citizens. They paid the price so that you could have the freedom to get an education. Don\u2019t ever forget it!\u201d Angela included appreciation to her Daddy for the right not only for her students, and her daughters to sit in their desks, but for her, her sisters Annette and Anita, and all teachers to be able to stand in front of those desks each and every day! She said, \u201cGod bless you and all our Veterans, whether they served in hostile conditions or not\u2026all had their part in protecting our rights!\u201d\nBecause of these men and women who have served our country so honorably and proudly, we have been GIVEN these rights, even the right to protest freely without fear of any consequences if we so choose! Countless veterans and fallen heroes have shed their blood as part of the price of this \u201cfree\u201d in freedom. If you see a veteran this week, express your gratitude to them for their gift of freedom! We appreciate our freedom, and the right to RECYCLE, REUSE and REDUCE to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Nov. 3, 2011\nHowdy Folks! Whew! Our final road clean for 2011 is history, the roads are cleaned and almost everyone wants them to stay that way! All the numbers aren\u2019t crunched, but $8,120 was spent for this last clean representing this year\u2019s end of the $17,842.59 Litter Abatement Grant. Roughly, $400 were spent on the bags and gloves for the workers and a total of $17,770.00 was paid to school, church and community groups. These groups use this money to support their teams, organizations, and charities which is most helpful to them in these tough economic times! Because\nBracken\nCounty\nemploys a Solid Waste Coordinator, we are eligible to apply for grant funding for litter abatement, tire amnesties, dump grants and other Ky. Division of Waste Management programs. While this requires a lot of paper work on our part, we feel it is well worth the effort to help non-profit groups to reach their financial potential.\nEven if Bracken County did not apply for grant funding for litter abatement, under Kentucky law (401 KAR49:080), the county would still be responsible for conducting litter abatement activities and still required to include this information in the Solid Waste Annual Report sent to Frankfort by March 1. Litter Abatement funding is determined by a formula which includes information such as the number of county and state miles within the county boundaries, population, funds available for any given year, the number of counties requesting funding and a few other details which we really don\u2019t worry about! We are delighted to get the funding and see that it is spent according to the laws governing the distribution.\nKentucky\nlaws stress the most important aspect of cleaning roads is the safety of the workers! This Fall Road Clean generated more than a few complaints from motorists concerning the actions of our many \u2018pickuplitterbugs\u2019. Necessarily, we give each group organizer a Safety Requirement Sheet which is to be read to the group before any cleaning begins. Necessity may dictate that we create a Safety Pledge Sheet for each worker to sign before any cleaning occurs, or maybe some of you can suggest a solution for correcting this problem! Safety of the workers is the number one goal, and it is the responsibility of the chaperons, the group organizer and all of us to make sure everyone remains safe while picking up the trash of our irresponsible, lazy and inconsiderate litterbugs! As motorists we have the responsibility of driving very carefully when encountering the workers with their lime-green t-shirts and orange trash bags!\nIt is also everyone\u2019s responsibility to set their clocks back one hour this Sunday as our daylight saving time ends! We sort of, kind of understand the concept behind this yearly ritual of springing forward and falling backward, but it is certainly a chore to get up at 2 AM on Sunday morning and set all those clocks back one hour! Just kidding! Our clocks are usually set back by mid Saturday afternoon or as soon as we remember on Saturday, so that we can get a head start on re-adjusting to the time change! This has nothing to do with the time change, but we just remembered a quote we recently read that some of our senior citizens may appreciate \u2013 consciousness is that annoying time between naps! With the rain hitting the window this Monday morning, it seems like a good time to do just that, but not before we remind you to RECYCLE, REUSE and REDUCE to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for October 27, 2011\nHowdy Folks! Just a few short days and the county will come to life with all kinds of ghosts, goblins, action figures, fair maidens and every type of character in between! Halloween is upon us and it is always a fun time for the kids and we adults enjoy watching those excited little ones! We urge everyone to drive carefully and watch for those children who get caught up in the excitement and inadvertently dart into the street. Trick or Treating, Beggars Night, Cabbage Night or whatever you call it only lasts for a few hours each year, but brings much happiness and many memories so let\u2019s make it as safe as possible for these make believe characters! Granted, Halloween of yesterday is a far cry from the holiday it has evolved into today, but then every holiday has escalated and as the adults, we are the ones that need to set the limits and rein in the runaway celebrations.\nWe felt like celebrating on Friday when we picked up the\nMilford\ntrailer! Someone had put in three big pieces of clear plastic rolled up and two larger pieces of Styrofoam, but the trailer was not loaded down with trash! The only trash we retrieved from any of the trailers last week were two old trash cans, a T.V. and a mineral bucket from the\nGermantown\ntrailer and a bag with an uneaten pizza along with the remains of the pizza meal from the\nTaylor\ntrailer which became a bigger problem! After tossing the trash bag into the bed of our truck, we somehow managed to forget to put it into the dumpster. That night, either the neighborhood cat or the local large raccoon made a meal out of that forgotten trash! Needless to say, we had a mess and hopefully we will not be so forgetful in the future, but \u2026..now, what were we talking about?\nAs noted, we are forgetful at times, and can understand how sometimes you might forget or just be in a hurry, but we sure have an awful lot of boxes that are not broken down! Flattened boxes do not take up nearly the amount of space as whole boxes, which allows for more recycling material to be put into the trailers, which means fewer trips to the recycling center which means less tax dollars spent on fuel and wear and tear of the truck and trailers. Also, Styrofoam in its many varied shapes, sizes and colors can occupy a lot of space, but cannot be recycled and needs to be put in the trash for Rumpke pickup.\nThis is Monday morning and we may have been a little hasty about bragging on the trailers. David Sticklen has been a family friend and neighbor all his life and he just stopped in to say that on Sunday night he had removed a huge amount of vinyl siding from the trailer that is parked at the Extension Office on the weekends. There were so many boxes that were not broken down and the siding that there wasn\u2019t any room for his recycling. David said he knew it was not recyclable because he had called us a year or two ago when he was re-siding his home and wanted to know if the old vinyl was recyclable, which, of course, it wasn\u2019t. So please, no siding. We appreciate everyone caring for our ever changing environment, and encourage the formation of habits that sustain and protect that environment by RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Oct. 20, 2011\nHowdy Folks! What a beautiful Sunday to spend with family and friends as we caught up on family happenings at the Jefferson Family Reunion at the W.O.W. Lodge in\nGermantown\n! Aunt Eileen Hester has returned home and doing well, Uncle Tom Jefferson is keeping Aunt Mildred on her toes and Aunt Norma Jean Vermillion stays very active in her church, community and family! Of course, on any given day we can see Wiley, Mutt and Joetta out and about in\nBracken\nCounty\nand they and their families are doing fine. Several family members were unable to attend and were very much missed, but hopefully we will see them at next year\u2019s reunion on October 21, 2012!\nThe tire dumps on Mini Farms Road and\nLinville Lane\nhave been cleaned by the state and they certainly will not be missed! We have not had any statistics from the Division of Waste Management as to number of tires, costs, etc., but the main concern is that they are gone and in the process of being recycled. Hopefully tire dumps nationwide are becoming just a bad memory as folks realize how harmful to the earth and how unhealthy to humans this destructive practice was.\nAnother unhealthy practice is putting non-recyclables in the recycling trailers and again this past Friday the recycling trailer in\nMilford\ncontained bags of trash, a T.V., a toaster oven and more carpeting. An anonymous caller alerted us to the fact that these items were in there but the rain on Thursday prevented us from getting anything out. We appreciate the call and are trying to determine a solution to our dilemma! We welcome and are open to any and all suggestions!\nFor a list of the Recycling Bin Schedule and Instructions check out page 7 of the October 6 issue of the Bracken County News. This listing is included in The News every other month on the first Thursday as a reminder for those of you who are veteran recyclers and as an aid for those of you who are rookie recyclers! Plastics are the topic for many recycling discussions, but recently we have had a number of questions on glass recycling. Glass jars that are used as food containers, as well as bottles for beer, wine, pop, etc. are recyclable. Drinking glasses, window and door panes, and mirrors are made with an additive that prevents them from being recycled in our area. Metropolitan areas can recycle just about everything, but rural communities across the nation are limited at this point in time.\nOn Monday, October 24, Creative Recycling (our electronic scrap recycling company) will be here to pickup the computers, component parts, rechargeable batteries, household batteries, cell phone and all the other electronic scrap we have collected over the last several months. If anyone has any of these items and wants to get them recycled, please drop them off at our office this week. Several folks that we have talked with over the course of the year have indicated that they have such items in their homes, so now is the time to get them out of your way for good! Also, if you need to get rid of any old appliances or scrap metal, please drop them off behind the Bracken County Maintenance Barn. As a nation, we are considered a throw-away society, but we know this is not good for the environment or the future, so each of us must be responsible for RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Oct. 13, 2011\nHowdy Folks! Autumn leaves are showing off their beautiful colors and the window of opportunity to view this natural tapestry will not last long! If you don\u2019t get a chance to take a drive specifically to enjoy the scenery, than make sure you take a few moments during your daily commute to drink in the glory of God\u2019s creation! These leaves will soon \u2018leave\u2019 us, signaling the onset of colder weather, so let\u2019s make the most of these autumn days!\nOur Bracken County Litter Patrol workers are taking advantage of the fall weather and will be cleaning roadways through October 27, so be sure to drive carefully in these areas. Over 600 bags of trash have been collected by these workers so far in 2011 and while picking up someone\u2019s garbage is not a fun job, these workers take pride in making the roadways more beautiful and safe. Highway litter seems to be diminishing somewhat, due in part to the three road cleans mandated each year as recipients of litter abatement funding. Everyone should be grateful for the Litter Abatement Grant Program of the Division of Waste Management and administered by local Solid Waste Coordinators. Without this funding, our state and county highways would look horrible with the accumulation of daily litter! Hopefully, our young drivers are learning the very negative effects of littering and will be the generation to stop, and lay to rest the very bad habit of littering!\nBeing good stewards of Mother Earth is a positive habit and recently, we have had some questions concerning the disposal of paint because the callers wanted to dispose of their unused paint the correct way. Paint is no longer considered a hazardous household waste because it does not contain lead, but it does require special handling. Large amounts of paint are usually donated, but most folks have just a small amount of paint left in the can that is creating the disposal problem. Paint needs to be dried or solidified before it can be sent to Rumpke. This can be accomplished by mixing it with shredded paper, kitty litter, sand or even dirt. It can also be poured out onto several layers of newspaper and left to dry -- just be sure it is out of reach of any children or pets! Once dried, or solidified, the dried paint and its container can be put in the trash for Rumpke pickup. Rumpke is responsible for any spills on the roadway and liquid paint is definitely a spill waiting to happen!\nWe are waiting to find the person(s) responsible for using\nMilford\n\u2019s recycling trailer as a dumpster! Once again on Friday this trailer contained numerous bags of garbage and remnants of a burn barrel which had to be removed. This type of material is difficult to get rid of , but we did the best we could. Please give us a call if you notice any misuse of this trailer.\nSeveral folks had Monday off in observance of Columbus Day which historically is October 12, but since 1970 has been celebrated in the\nUnited States\non the second Monday of October thus allowing many federal employees a three day weekend. For those of us who didn\u2019t get the day off, maybe we can help our bosses celebrate next Monday, October 17, as it has been designated as National Boss Day! Whether it is designated on the calendar or not, every day is an excellent day to observe the good habits of RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for October 6, 2011\nHowdy Folks! Brrrrrr! This past weekend was certainly chilly but great chili weather, which, by the way, tasted mighty good with the pimento cheese sandwiches while we watched the cold wind blowing the leaves around! By the end of the week we will be back into the seventies, with the weekend just giving us a reminder of what is to come! Hopefully the light frost killed some of the ragweed that is creating havoc with so many folks with allergies. While we have been blessed to have warm winter clothing, there is a need in the community for coats/hats/gloves for families who are facing some tough financial challenges. If you have new or good used items to donate to the\nBracken County Coat Drive\nplease drop them off at the Licking Valley CAP\u2019s Quarter Corner or the Bracken County FRYSC. These winter apparel items will be distributed on October 1-15 from 9 AM til 3 PM Monday thru Friday at the Quarter Corner and any donation will help warm the bodies as well as the souls of the grateful recipients!\nThe\nMilford\ntrailer was again filled with non-recyclables this past Friday when someone put six large black bags filled with all sorts of household trash and unwanted items. Again, we ask that if anyone sees any illegal disposal of their garbage into the trailers, please give us a call. It was a lot easier seven years ago when we started this job to get into the trailers and remove the unwanted items! With each passing year this becomes more of a challenge and with the challenges that are already a necessary part of daily living, we really would like to pass on this one! Last week the Brooksville trailer received some repairs and the trailer that rotates from Augusta Depot to Foster and Gertrude will get a turn, possibly in the next couple of weeks.\nWe are most happy to announce that the tire dumps will soon be a distant memory! Work began last week on gathering the tires into one area so that they can then be loaded unto large trucks for removal. In 2006 we contacted the State Division of Waste Management to look at the tire dump (at that time we were aware of only one dump). After the inspection we were informed that the dump would be put on a list to be cleaned by the state. Finally in 2010 we asked how far down Bracken County was on the tire dump list and were shocked to learn that we weren\u2019t even on the list! For some unknown reason, we were never added to the list and had waited and wasted four years! All that is history and a state contracted company is now in the process of ridding two properties tires! Live and learn! The next time we won\u2019t be so patient, but we sincerely hope that there is not a \u2018next time\u2019!\nBracken\nCounty\nLitter Patrol workers will be out for the last time this year during October and we remind everyone to drive carefully when they encounter the lime-green shirts and bright orange garbage bags! Picking up trash that someone has carelessly and willfully thrown out may be a way to make money for non-profit groups, but it is the lack of responsibility of the litterbug that really irks the Litter Patrol workers! What if everyone decided to discard of their trash in this manner? Please properly dispose of your throw-a-ways which could include RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for Sept. 29, 2011\nHowdy Folks! We were very fortunate and blessed this Monday as the three to four inches of rain that fell in Northern Kentucky did not make it to\nBracken\nCounty\n! Our rain gauge indicated just a little over an inch of rain which is sufficient for now. A dry spell would really be good so that our farmers can finish tobacco housing and for us, the company is ready to finally tackle the two tire dumps on Mini Farms Road. But we do need dry weather for both and hopefully the good Lord will see fit to bless us!\nWe really didn\u2019t feel too blessed this past Friday when we picked up the recycling trailer from\nMilford\n! There were some pieces of carpet padding on the outside of the trailer, so we were pretty sure that the inside was not going to be to our liking! Someone had loaded the trailer down with old, nasty carpet padding and equally nasty red carpet and since all this was on bottom, those were the first items that were put in the trailer on Wednesday after we had delivered it. Normally we remove the trash but there was just too much of it and not something these two oldsters wanted to deal with on a pretty day, much less in the rain that was coming down Friday morning. Our only alternative was to take the trailer to the landfill in order to dispose of the contents.\nIf you have ever been to a landfill you know that it is not a pleasant place to be and when it is raining, all the smells are magnified and the mud that gets on the truck, trailer and your shoes is not your good old country dirt. If dirt can be considered \u201cdirty\u201d, landfill mud dirt is really \u201cdirty\u201d! Of course, that is because it is what it is and it is a landfill \u2013 the resting place of human discards of every size, shape and consistency! So not only did we have to get rid of the carpeting, we also had to get rid of any good recycling that those of you took the time and effort to put into the Milford trailer. We apologize for that, but at that point in time, we had to do it! Please folks, carpet and padding are not recyclable in this area and the trailer that sits in front of the old store in\nMilford\nis not a dumpster! If anyone happened to notice someone putting old carpet into the trailer this past Wednesday, give us a call.\nWhile we are thinking about trailers, the trailer behind the Brooksville Fire Department will be gone a few days for the final stage of repair. We realize this will be an inconvenience for many of you, but hopefully it will be back in operation within a few days. In the meantime, please use any of the trailers located at the High School, Middle School and Taylor Elementary. A footnote to this trailer: You will recall that early this summer we were having a very difficult time with someone putting sacks of garbage that contained dirty diapers into this trailer. The guilty party was finally contacted and made aware that this trailer was for recycling and not a dumpster. Were we ever relieved when the green flies took leave of the recycling trailer! We appreciate all of you who take the time to properly recycle as do the workers at the\nRecycling\nCenter\n, and Mother Earth appreciates everyone who RECYCLES, REUSES and REDUCES to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for September 22, 2011\nHowdy Folks! Welcome to Autumn 2011! Tomorrow is the first day of the fall season and it has certainly gotten here much too quickly! Leaves and foliage have begun turning colors a little, but will reach their peak colors in a couple or three weeks so keep your eyes on your favorite tree or bush to enjoy the full beauty of the fall colors! It\u2019s been a tradition in our household for many years to take a drive during the fall to look at all the trees with a prayer of thanksgiving for all the many beautiful colors God has created. Hopefully, many of you will be able to get out and take in the many sights of\nBracken\n! Besides having many beautifully landscaped homes,\nBracken\nCounty\noffers an abundance of wooded areas on every road in the county to afford everyone some colorful scenery on every commute!\nOf course, with our job we often times have to see the not-so-pretty spots in the county and the fall is the time that the Division of Waste Management encourages Solid Waste Coordinators throughout the state to drive around to observe any illegal dumping of any kind. We do know that someone has been dumping at Cumminsville on the creek bank between the bridges. If anyone has seen garbage being thrown from a vehicle in that location, please give us a call. This site has been cleaned several times and we want to keep it clean. It is not an easy job collecting garbage from along creek banks and one that gets harder with each passing year \u2013 something to do with bones and muscles not working as well as in years gone by! We also have a site on Route 8 along a pull-off by the railroad just west of\nWrangling Run Road\nwhere someone has deposited a large amount of roofing shingles. When the Bracken County Maintenance workers get some time, they will have to use a loader to get this mess picked up. If you know of any areas that are being used as a dumping ground, please let us know and if you observe anyone putting their trash along a highway, again, please give us a call.\nBracken\nCounty\nis a rural home to over 9000 residents and we want to keep it clean, green and beautiful for everyone now and for generations to come!\nAn article in Resource Recycling Magazine was written by the Automotive Aftermath Industry Association praising auto repair shops across the country for their continued recycling efforts. 88% of all shops report recycling tires that are made into numerous items including asphalt, crumb rubber and even the pens that we distributed on Community Day! Auto shops have for many years, if not decades, recycled used engine oil, oil filters, batteries, scrape metal, parts cleaning solvents, plastics, cardboard and paper, wood pallets and dunnage. (Okay, we had never actually encountered the word \u201cdunnage\u201d and so we checked the definition. It is packing material such as boards, blocks, metal or plastic bracing used in supporting and securing packages for shipping and handling.) The funny thing about checking the spelling of this word is that the computer was telling us that we were spelling it wrong while at the same time providing a definition! You have to love computers, which, by the way, if they give you too much trouble, you can just recycle! Enjoy the fall weather and remember to RECYCLE, REUSE and REDUCE to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for August 25, 2011\nHowdy Folks! Are you ready for this? Four months from today is Christmas!! This year of 2011 is simply flying by! Birthday wishes are sent to grandsons Tyler and\nAustin\nand granddaughter Alyssa, and anniversary congratulations to R.T. and Tina and Michael and Jeanna for the month of August! The August Birthday Calendars are jam-packed and we send best wishes to everyone celebrating special days in the month of August. Labor Day is September 5 and before we forget to mention it, the\nRecycling\nCenter\nwill be closed on that day so rotations of the trailers won\u2019t start until Tuesday, September 6.\nWe made seven trips to the\nRecycling\nCenter\nlast week with what seemed to be full trailers, but were not, because of the many boxes that were not flattened. With schools back in session the volume of boxes increase simply because schools cannot function without supplies that come in boxes. We encourage all staff, personnel, faculty and students to become proactive and as soon as a box is emptied, flatten it. This makes it much easier to store or carry the boxes and certainly allows the recycling trailers to be filled to capacity.\nSome property nuisance violations were on the agenda also last week. Pictures of the reported properties had to be taken to be included with a report that is given to County Attorney Michael Clark.\nBracken\nCounty\nNuisance Ordinance passed in 1994 and was revised in 2008 and is an aid in providing for the safety and health of the citizens and maintaining the beauty and environmental health of the county. A copy of the nine-page Nuisance Ordinance #08-002 is sent with each Nuisance Ordinance Violation.\nA couple of weeks ago we met with representatives of the Division of Waste Management and Martin Tire Company who will be cleaning the two tire dumps in the county. To date no equipment has been brought in for the tire removal, but we are hoping soon! As with every government agency, many budget cuts have been made in the last several months in the Division of Waste Management but we have been assured that these tires will eventually be history!\nFr. Ed gave us a history lesson during his homily this past Sunday which we thought everyone would enjoy. President George Bush was visiting a nursing home with wife Barbara and stopped to speak with a gentleman in a wheel chair who was nearing the century mark. President Bush shook the hand of the elderly gentleman and asked, \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d Without missing a beat the gentleman looked at President Bush and said, \u201cIf you will ask one of the nurses around here, I\u2019m sure they can tell you!\u201d This story brought quickly to mind Mrs. Josie Poe, a resident of the Bracken County Nursing and\nRehab\nCenter\nfor a few short years who passed away on Saturday at the age of 101. We never had the good fortune of meeting Mrs. Poe, but we know many of her family members including Amy Meyer who works at the Bracken County News. From time to time Amy has given us a glimpse of her Grandmother who was a life-long citizen of\nBracken\nCounty\nand who quietly and without fanfare raised a fine family! Our sincerest sympathy and prayers for God\u2019s comfort and peace are extended to Amy and her family. The word \u2018recycling\u2019 was not used by Mrs. Poe\u2019s generation, but she and many of her generation were pioneers in the foundation of RECYCLING, REUSING and REDUCING to keep God\u2019s earth clean, green and beautiful! Be seein\u2019 you \u2013 Bin & Bug.\nTrash Talk for August 18, 2011\nHowdy Folks! By now all the area children are back in school and we pray that this is a most productive school year for them! Even though we have been out of school for more years than we care to admit, we must say that the learning process does not stop with the acquisition of a diploma! Good study habits formed during the school years create a stepping stone to a lifelong journey of acquiring knowledge through study, exploration and experimentation. We encourage all students to capitalize on these golden years of opportunity for learning and once this appetite for knowledge is gained, the whole world becomes a smorgasbord of learning to satisfy their insatiable hunger for knowledge!\nA section in the Resource Recycling Magazine is devoted monthly to recently invented products made from recycled materials. The product that caught our eye is being produced by the Vij5 Company and is known as NewspaperWood but was invented by Mieke Meijer while a student at the Design Academy Eindhoven in\nEindhoven\n,\nNetherlands\n. By carefully layering old newspapers, attaching them with glue and rolling them up tight, NewspaperWood actually has the consistency, texture and appearance of wood including the same growth rings that are seen in trees! Because NewspaperWood functions just like normal wood it can be sanded, sawed and carved into everything from jewelry to even a printing press!

The International Conference on Financing for Development will be held in Mexico in March 2002 at the highest political level including a summit, says the concluding resolution of the second FFD PrepCom, which ended on 23 February 2001 in New York after two weeks of meetings.\nIt was also decided that the third session of the PrepCom, to be held in New York, will be split into two one-week meetings. The first was scheduled for 2-8 May 2001, following the Economic and Social Council/Bretton Woods Institutions High Level Dialogue on 1 May. The second will take place in October/November 2001 during a recess of the Second Committee of the General Assembly.\nTo prepare for the next session, governments were asked to send the United Nations FFD secretariat by 15 April 2001 a \u0093concise identification of possible initiatives and themes.\u0094 The secretariat will report on this inventory to the third session and provide a copy to the facilitator, Mauricio Escanero (Mexico). He will then prepare a \u0093working paper...which will serve as the means to further focus the discussions of the substantive preparatory process.\u0094\nBuilding on discussions in the first session and other relevant inputs, the facilitator will then prepare for the October/November session a \u0093concise first draft\u0094 to move the process toward the final preparatory phase.\nThe resolution also requests the FFD bureau to continue to explore ways and means to deepen the efforts of all relevant stakeholders at the regional level, as well as within civil society and the business community, in support of the FFD process. To strengthen participation of the business community, delegations suggested the May session devote one day to the issue of enhancing engagement with the business sector.\nContact: FFD Secretariat, Room 2018, 2 UN Plaza, New York NY 10017, United States, telephone +1-212/963 4690, fax +1-212/963 1061, e-mail < ffd@un.org >, website ( www.un.org/esa/ffd ).\nIPCC REPORT\nLeading climate change experts and officials from some 100 governments meeting in Accra (Ghana) in February 2001 have finalized a major report assessing effective policies and technologies for tackling greenhouse gas emissions and the threat of human-induced climate change.\nVolume III of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, see Go Between 84 ) confirms that many cost-effective solutions to rising greenhouse gas emissions are available today. However, in many cases governments will need to address various institutional, behavioural and other barriers before these solutions can realize their potential.\nG.O.P Obasi, Secretary-General of WMO which together with UNEP launched IPCC in 1988, said that \u0093the Third Assessment Report....represents a remarkable consensus and a sound basis for international decision making.\u0094 He called upon the world's governments to consider rapidly a legislative framework for effective implementation of the many available cost-effective solutions to the greenhouse emissions problem.\nThe choice of energy mix and associated investment will determine whether atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases can be stabilized, and if so at what level and cost, says the report. Currently most such investment is directed toward discovering and developing more fossil resources, both conventional and unconventional.\nThe report concludes that the progress since 1995 on developing technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions has been faster than anticipated. Important advances have included the market introduction of efficient hybrid engine cars and wind turbines, the demonstration of underground carbon dioxide storage, the advance of fuel cell technology and the rapid elimination of certain industrial gases.\nWhile a change in energy supply will play a central role, hundreds of technologies and practices for end-use energy efficiency in buildings, transport and manufacturing industry account for more than half of the potential for global emissions reductions from 2010 to 2020. The report cites some studies that show half of this potential can be realized through options that actually save money\u0096known as \u0093no regrets\u0094 options. However, governments will need to adopt more supportive policies if this potential is to be realized.\nContact: IPCC Secretariat, Care of WMO, 7 bis Avenue de la Paix, CP 2300, CH-1211 Geneva 2, Switzerland, telephone +41-22/730 8208, fax +41-22/730 8025, e-mail < ipcc_sec@gateway.wmo.ch >, website ( www.ipcc.ch ).\n60 MILLION FACE FOOD EMERGENCIES\nSome 60 million people in 33 countries are facing food emergencies of varying intensity, according to a report released in March by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\nFoodcrops and Shortages says that 16 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are suffering from exceptional food emergencies, caused mostly by natural disasters and civil strife. And despite improved weather conditions, effects of the drought in Eastern Africa are still being felt in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Sudan and Tanzania, where emergency food assistance continues to be provided to some 18 million people by international relief agencies. The number of refugees and internally displaced people due to civil strife continues to increase, particularly in Central and Western Africa. In southern Africa serious flooding in some areas, particularly in Mozambique, has caused loss of life and damage to property, infrastructure and crops.\nAsia has seen a grave food crisis emerge in Afghanistan, caused by incessant civil strife and successive droughts and harsh winters. In Mongolia, another extremely cold winter has killed large numbers of livestock, aggravating the food insecurity of nomadic herders who lost millions of their livestock last year. A total of 11 countries in Asia are reported to be facing food emergencies.\nIn Central America, El Salvador's food production and marketing in 2001 will be constrained by the damaged infrastructure caused by earthquakes that hit the country in early January and mid-February. In South America, the wheat harvest is completed and prospects for coarse grain crops in the field are favorable, says the report.\nOne of the coldest winters on record in the United States contributed to reducing yields. Official estimates indicate that the winter wheat area has declined by 5% since last year\u0096the lowest level since 1971. Dry conditions at sowing time in the main growing areas are reportedly the major reason.\nFood Crops and Shortages forecasts that the winter grain area planted in the European Community is likely to decline from last year due to unfavourable weather. It also says that persistent drought and high temperatures in central and eastern Europe will negatively affect the 2001 cereal harvests. In Russia, displaced people in Chechnya and surrounding republics continue to need food assistance.\nContact: John Riddle, Information Officer, FAO, Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, I-00100 Rome, Italy, telephone +39-06/5705 3259, fax +39-06/5705 3699, e-mail < john.riddle@fao.org >, website ( www.fao.org/WAICENT/faoinfo/economic/giews/ english/giewse.htm ).\nSECURITY COUNCIL SUMMIT REVIEW\nThe UN Security Council met in a day-long session on 7 March 2001 in New York to review commitments made at its Summit meeting last September (see NGLS Roundup 62 ), which aimed at strengthening the UN's ability to address challenges to peace and security.\nDuring the Summit, which was addressed by 14 heads of state or government and one foreign minister, Resolution 1318 was adopted which committed the Council to:\n-- act preventively in the future;\n-- improve the UN's capacity to act effectively; and\n-- act quickly and decisively.\nThe Summit also produced a declaration committing the Council to such principles as: treating all regions of the world equally; strengthening peacekeeping and other instruments at its disposal; contributing to addressing the root causes of conflict; giving special attention to Africa; and strengthening cooperation and communication between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations.\nAt the March review, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the Council the task it faced was to establish progress it had made in overcoming the \u0093crisis of credibility\u0094 of the UN. Noting that Council resolutions were not \u0093self-implementing\u0094 and \u0093their impact on reality\u0094 depended on subsequent effort, he said it was vital that delegates attending the Council's meetings maintained a constant dialogue with their capitals.\n\u0093This dialogue needs to start before a resolution is passed,\u0094 he said, \u0093and it needs to continue long afterwards\u0085.Only through a much deeper and broader involvement of Member States, reaching up to the highest political level, can the will and resources needed to implement your resolutions be mustered.\u0094\nThe Council was told by several delegations, including Egypt and Algeria, that it was still not treating conflicts equally in all regions of the world, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. Its efforts to involve states that contributed troops to peacekeeping missions in its work were described as not yet adequate. Egypt and Pakistan both emphasized the need for the formal and institutionalized participation of troop contributors in decision making at all stages.\nCanada said it was pleased with the Security Council's response to the Report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, known as the Brahimi Report (see Go Between 82 ). Canada noted there had been changes in decision-making processes for operations, including progress on transparent three-way relationships among the Council, UN Secretariat and troop-contributing countries.\nThe representative of Sweden, on behalf of the European Union (EU) and associated countries, emphasized that the UN's role could not go beyond the will of the parties involved in a conflict. Unless there was a real desire for peace, the EU said, there were limits as to what the international community could do. Conflicts could not be dealt with effectively without tackling their root causes.\nRussia and China were wary of the Council expanding its role into what they described as areas outside its purview. Russia said the UN Charter clearly speaks to the respective duties and obligations of all the various branches of the Organization, therefore the Council should concentrate on its main task\u0096maintenance of international peace and security.\nMany delegations praised the Council's progress on issues such as \u0093conflict diamonds\u0094 (see Go Between 84 ), small arms trafficking, HIV/AIDS and violations of international humanitarian law. However, Israel's continued occupation of the Palestinian territories and the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) were cited repeatedly when discussing lack of progress in improving the Council's work and restoring its credibility.\nUNEP REPORT ON DEPLETED URANIUM\nA report released in March 2001 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) describes the environmental impact of depleted uranium (DU) ammunition used during the 1999 Kosovo conflict.\nSeven and a half DU penetrators were found during a UNEP field mission in November 2000 to 11 sites out of 112 identified as targets of ordnance containing DU. Low levels of radiation were detected in the immediate vicinity of the points of impact, and mild contamination from DU dust was measured near the targets. There was also some evidence of airborne DU contamination near targeted sites.\nIn addition to U-238, which makes up the bulk of depleted uranium, the penetrators contained uranium isotope U-236 and plutonium isotope Pu-239/240. The presence of these transuranic elements in the DU indicates that at least some of the material has been in nuclear reactors. However, the amount of transuranic isotopes found in the DU penetrators is very low, according to UNEP, and does not have any significant impact on their overall radioactivity.\nIt is highly likely that penetrators are still lying on the ground surface. Although the radiological and chemical risks of touching a penetrator are insignificant, if put into a pocket or somewhere else close to the human body there would be external beta radiation of the skin. This would lead to \u0093quite high local radiation doses after some weeks of continuous exposure,\u0094 according to UNEP.\nRegarding contamination points, if a child were to ingest small amounts of soil the corresponding radiological risk would be \u0093insignificant.\u0094 However, \u0093from a biochemical point of view the possible intake might be somewhat higher than the applicable health standard,\u0094 according to UNEP.\nThere are still \u0093considerable scientific uncertainties, especially related to the safety of groundwater,\u0094 said Pekka Haavisto, Chairman of UNEP's Depleted Uranium Assessment Team. \u0093Additional work has to be done to reduce these uncertainties and to monitor the quality of water.\u0094\nAlthough the mission findings \u0093show no cause for alarm,\u0094 the report describes specific situations where risks could be significant. There are also scientific uncertainties relating to the longer-term behavior of DU in the environment. For these reasons, UNEP is calling for certain precautionary actions. These should include visiting all DU sites in Kosovo, removing slightly radioactive penetrators and jackets on the surface, decontaminating areas where feasible, and providing information to local populations on precautions to be taken if DU is found.\nContact: Tore J.

They also noted the importance of assessment as a tool that can promote policy coherence between trade and environment ministries. A new round of trade liberalization talks will likely be launched at the World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Qatar in November.\nThe Berlin meeting, held under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and Germany, examined the linkages between environment, sustainable development and trade policies which are often in conflict with one another.\nKlaus T\u00f6pfer, UNEP Executive Director, said that over the last 50 years there has been a rapid expansion of world trade, with the total value of global exports growing from US$350 billion in 1950 to almost US$5.5 trillion in 1999.\n\u0093Trade liberalization contributes to economic growth,\u0094 he said, \u0093yet the benefits have not been fairly shared between countries and, in some cases, have led to greater environmental degradation and increased poverty. One part of the solution is for trade and environment policymakers to work together to develop mutually supportive trade and environment policies. Such collaboration will maximize the economic and ecological benefits that can be gained from trade liberalization.\u0094\nDiscussions at the meeting, which included representatives from trade as well as environment ministries, focused on the methods for conducting environmental assessments of trade policies at the national level, the relationship between Multilateral Environment Agreements (MEAs) and the WTO, and the role of economic instruments in promoting coherent, consistent trade and environment policies.\nParticipants examined UNEP-led country studies that show how environmental assessments can help maximize the net development gains of trade liberalization by minimizing negative environmental effects. They then focused on concrete solutions to the complex trade and environment relationship.\nContact: Robert Bisset, Office of the Spokesman/Director, Communications and Public Information, UNEP, PO Box 30552, Nairobi, Kenya, telephone +254-2/623084, fax +254-2/623692, e-mail < robert.bisset@unep.org >, website ( www.unep.org ).\nGROUPS OF EXPERTS ON ENERGY\nMeeting for its second session from 26 February to 16 March 2001 in New York, the Ad Hoc Open-Ended Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Energy and Sustainable Development (see Go Between 80 ) focused on issues including accessibility of energy, energy efficiency, renewable energy, advanced fossil fuel technologies, nuclear energy technologies, rural energy, and energy and transport. The Expert Group also examined the overarching issues of research and development, information sharing and dissemination, making markets work better, technology transfer, capacity building, mobilization of financial resources, and public participation.\nIn delivering their general statements, delegations offered views on policy options and where the energy discussions should take place within the myriad of fora devoted to sustainable development. Developing countries highlighted the growing demand for energy in the developing world and the current inequities in energy consumption. They also stressed the need to improve access to energy services, develop cleaner energy technologies and the transfer of technology, and the importance of new and additional resources from their developed country partners.\nSome industrialized country delegations underscored the importance of renewable energy technologies, cleaner fossil fuel technology, and considering energy within an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable framework. One group of industrialized countries said future energy policies should emphasize open and competitive energy markets within regulatory frameworks that promote sustainable development.\nIn its deliberations the Expert Group used a text put forward by the two Co-Chairs, Irene Freudenschuss-Reichl (Austria) and Mohammed Reza Salamat (Iran). In what proved to be contentious negotiations, governments were unable to reach consensus on the entire document. They forwarded a text that will require further negotiations to the ninth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD-9) meeting from 16-27 April 2001 in New York.\nOne of the most divisive issues proved to be nuclear energy; some delegations, arguing for the right to have this technology as part of a country's energy mix, chose to focus on increasing safety standards. Others suggested that concerns about safety, spent fuel and waste management made nuclear energy incompatible with sustainable development. This was also stressed by small island developing states, a number of which called for the phase-out of transboundary movements of nuclear waste.\nOne significant industrialized negotiating group, lacking consensus, took an accommodating position on nuclear energy. It focused on improving the safety standards associated with this technology and supported national regulatory agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). NGOs expressed concern with what they described as a lack of leadership from this large group.\nA large number of developing countries also expressed diverging positions on nuclear energy; some wanted to continue their use and development of the technology while others said it was an inappropriate energy option for all developing countries. In this connection, one leading oil-producing nation on several occasions called for the phase-out of nuclear energy. The text on nuclear energy, in its entirety, was forwarded to CSD-9 for further negotiation.\nThe issue of international cooperation also proved difficult, as delegations disagreed over the role of the Expert Group in relation to other fora dealing with sustainable development and its related issues. Several developing countries preferred to see energy issues integrated into the process leading to the 2002 World Summit for Sustainable Development (Rio+10). While many delegations supported the idea of improving international coordination, as well as within the UN system, there was no agreement on strengthening the UN's role in the area of energy for sustainable development. The entire section on international cooperation would require further negotiation at CSD-9.\nOther areas of disagreement requiring further negotiation by CSD-9 include:\n-- advanced fuel technologies and carbon sequestration;\n-- the goals of poverty eradication and economic development taking priority over the goal of promoting renewable energies;\n-- making markets work better; and\n-- the elimination of subsidies on energy production and consumption.\nThe outcome of the second session and will also be discussed by the Commission under the Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Energy and Transport.\nThe formation of the Ad Hoc Group of Experts was mandated by the UN General Assembly in 1997 in order to examine the complexities and interdependencies inherent in addressing energy issues within the context of sustainable development. The Group first met in March 2000 to prepare a report that was adopted by CSD-8.\nContact: Zehra Aydin-Sipos, Major Groups Programme Coordinator, Division for Sustainable Development, UN/DESA, 2 United Nations Plaza, 22nd Floor, New York NY 10017, United States, telephone +1-212/963 8811, fax +1-212/963 4260, e-mail < aydin@un.org >, website ( www.un.org/esa/sustdev ).\nUN FORUM ON FORESTS MEETING\nThe United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF), which met at UN headquarters from 13-16 February 2001, has decided to base its secretariat in New York. The decision was taken as the Forum finished up its organizational session and informal consultations to set a new approach toward international forest policy.\nThe coordinator and secretariat Head of the UNFF, Jagmohan Maini, said that the \u0093Group of 77 developing countries and China emphasized that the secretariat should be located in New York because this is where their missions can deal with this issue more effectively.\u0094\nThese countries, he noted, \u0093wanted to see a close synergy between the UN Forum on Forests and the Commission on Sustainable Development, as well as other functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council [ECOSOC].\u0094\nThe Forum, established last October as a subsidiary body under ECOSOC (see Go Between 83 ), works as a permanent negotiating venue for sustainable forest management. Some of the issues it will address include the continuing high rates of deforestation\u0096some 13 million hectares of forests are lost each year, mainly in the tropics\u0096and other longstanding and politically-sensitive issues.\nThese include lack of capacity in developing countries concerning sustainable forest management, and poverty alleviation through forest development and trade issues such as illegal logging. The UNFF has also been charged with assessing, within five years, the parameters of a mandate for developing a legal framework for all types of forests.\nThe Forum will include ministerial segments and is open to all governments. Participation by groups including NGOs, the private sector and other interested stakeholders is planned to promote dialogue and coordinated action. As part of the new arrangement on forests, ECOSOC has also invited heads of relevant international organizations to form a Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF). It would aim to support UNFF's work and enhance international cooperation on forest-related issues.\nIn response to ECOSOC's invitation, members of the high-level Interagency Task Force (ITFF) have initiated a process to form the Partnership by the first substantive session of the UNFF from 11-22 June 2001 in New York.\nThe first substantive session will be followed by\u0096over the next five years\u0096two meetings in Geneva, one in Costa Rica, and a fifth in New York. It was also decided to elect a new bureau every year. The agenda for the first session will include a multi-year programme of work and Plan of Action.\nThe UNFF secretariat plans to launch a Calendar of Major International Forest-Related Events, which will be updated regularly. The first calendar is available on website ( www.un.org/esa/sustdev/unffdocs/unff2001 ).\nContact: Secretariat, United Nations Forum on Forests, Division for Sustainable Development, Department of Social and Economic Affairs (DESA), 2 UN Plaza, 12th Floor, New York NY 10017, United States, telephone +1-212/963 6208, fax +1-212/963 3463, e-mail < vahanen@un.org >, website ( www.un.org/esa/sustdev/forests.htm ).\nUNECE EMISSIONS REPORTING\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) launched negotiations in Geneva in February on a legally binding instrument requiring companies to report to the public about their polluting emissions into the environment.\nUnder the new law, countries will have to set up pollution inventories known as pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs). These systems require corporate polluters to report periodically on their emissions of certain polluting substances to air, water and land, as well as their off-site transfers of such substances for treatment or disposal. All this information \u0093is reported electronically and made accessible to the public, including through the Internet, subject to limited exemptions,\u0094 according to the UNECE.\nPRTRs have already proved extremely effective in reducing pollution, said Kaj B\u00e4rlund, Director of the UNECE Environment and Human Settlements Division, even though they regulate information about pollution and not pollution itself. But by systematically bringing information on emissions into the public domain, PRTRs create public pressure to reduce pollution. The US system, known as the Toxics Release Inventory, is one of the most well-established PRTR systems. Few countries in Europe have so far developed PRTR systems, though some have plans to do so.\nThe new UNECE law will be established under the auspices of the Aarhus Convention\u0096the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters. The Convention is expected to enter into force this year. The new PRTR instrument was planned to be ready for adoption at the Fifth Ministerial Conference in the Environment for Europe series, scheduled in Kiev (Russia) in May 2003.\nContact: Jeremy Wates, Secretary to the Aarhus Convention, UNECE Environment and Human Settlements Division, Palais des Nations, Office 332, CH-1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland, telephone +41-22/917 23 84, fax +41-22/907 0107, e-mail < jeremy.wates@unece.org >, website ( www.unece.org/env/pp ).\nBIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY MEETINGS\nRepresentatives of the 180-member governments of the Convention on Biological Diversity met in Montreal (Canada) from 12-16 March 2001 to examine how best to detect, eradicate and control species that cross the oceans and other barriers to colonize new regions. Once in the new regions they can threaten the native plants, animals and ecosystems.\n\u0093Over the past few centuries,\u0094 said Klaus T\u00f6pfer, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), \u0093invasive alien species have caused untold damage to natural ecosystems and human economies alike. In today's highly integrated world, where tourism and trade offer more and more opportunities for unwanted species to hitchhike to new homes, we urgently need a more effective international system for turning back the tide of harmful non-native species.\u0094\nThe meeting considered draft principles for guiding action against invasive alien species. The principles relate to issues such as the precautionary approach, the ecosystem approach, border controls and quarantine measures, intentional and unintentional introductions, eradication, control and containment. The meeting also considered national reports detailing governments' current efforts as well as case studies.\nThe sixth meeting of the Convention's Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA), which met from 12-16 March in Montreal, addressed a range of other biodiversity matters. These included marine and coastal biodiversity, in-land water systems, scientific assessments, the Global Taxonomy Initiative, biodiversity and climate change, and migratory species.\nThe meetings' results and recommendations will be forwarded to the Conference of the Parties when it holds its sixth meeting in April 2002 in the Hague (Netherlands).\nContact: Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, World Trade Centre, 393 St Jacques Street, Office 300, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H2Y 1N9, telephone +1-514/288 2220, fax +1-514/288 6588, e-mail < secretariat@biodiv.org >, website ( www.biodiv.org ).\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE ON FISHERIES\nMore than 110 countries have adopted a Plan of Action against illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing at a March 2001 meeting in Rome at the Intergovernmental Committee on Fisheries.\nThe voluntary agreement, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), aims to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. Such practices are found within and outside exclusive economic zones (200 miles from coasts) and account for up to 30% of total catches. They are also blamed for over-fishing of several high value fish stocks, and in extreme cases can lead to the collapse of a fishery or seriously affect efforts to rebuild fish stocks that have been depleted.\n\u0093The Plan of Action will make it more difficult for fishing vessels to threaten the sustainability of the world's fisheries resources,\u0094 said Ichiro Nomura, FAO's Assistant Director-General of the Fisheries Department. \u0093With this new plan, the international community has a powerful tool to fight illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing.\u0094\nThe Plan of Action calls upon states to ensure that their nationals do not support or engage in IUU fishing. Among other things, it says that no vessel should be allowed to fish unless so authorized. States should cooperate to identify those who are the operators or owners of vessels involved in IUU fishing, and should avoid giving economic support or subsidies to those companies, vessels or individuals.\nThe Plan of Action also stresses and promotes \u0093flag state\u0094 responsibility. It says countries should ensure, before they register a fishing vessel, that vessels entitled to fly their flag do not engage in or support IUU fishing.\nIt also calls for better cooperation, information and data sharing between countries. For this purpose, a vessel monitoring system should be established, it says.\nThe Committee also decided to set up a Sub-Committee on Aquaculture to deal with important emerging issues connected with this food-producing activity. FAO said the Sub-Committee \u0093would serve as an intergovernmental mechanism for information exchange, discussion and consensus-building on emerging issues in aquaculture,\u0094 including guidance for governments and international bodies on technical and policy matters.\nReasons to establish the Sub-Committee include the growing contribution of aquaculture to global food security and economic development; the diversity of international trends affecting the sector, which require greater international cooperation; and the increasing need to address aquaculture issues in a global forum.\nFAO said China, Norway, Italy and the United States have made offers of funding to help set up the Sub-Committee. China offered to host its first meeting in conjunction with a gathering of the World Aquaculture Society, and an International Aquaculture Exhibition in Beijing in April 2002. Norway has offered to host the second session, also in conjunction with an international exhibition on aquaculture in August 2003.\nContact: Lucia D'Aleo, Media Relations Office, FAO, Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, I-00100 Rome, Italy, telephone +39-06/5705 2520, e-mail < lucia.daleo@fao.org >, website ( www.fao.org/fi/default.asp ).\nPLANT GENETIC RESOURCES IU\nParticipants met in Rome (Italy) from 5-10 February 2001 for the fifth Inter-Sessional Contact Group meeting on the Revision of the International Undertaking (IU) on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity (see Go Between 84 ).\nOver 100 people from 38 countries, along with representatives of intergovernmental and non-government organizations, took part in the meeting. It aimed to continue discussions on coverage of the multilateral system, governing body and secretariat, amendments of the undertaking and annexes, and a proposed article on supporting components of the multilateral system. There was also discussion on the legal basis of the IU in relation to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Convention on Biological Diversity.\nIn April 1993 the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, currently comprised of 166 countries, considered implications for the IU of the 1992 Earth Summit and the Convention on Biological Diversity. As a result, the commission agreed that the IU should be revised in order to be in harmony with the Convention. In November 1994 a first negotiating draft, grouped into 14 articles, was reviewed by the commission.\nContact: Jos\u00e9 Esquinas-Alc\u00e1zar, Secretary, Committee on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, I-00100 Rome, Italy, telephone +39-06/5705 4986, fax +39-06/5705 6347, e-mail < jose.esquinas@fao.org >, website ( www.fao.org ).\nECOSOC AFRICA POVERTY PANEL\nThe first in a series of panel discussions held in connection with the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) was held at UN headquarters in New York on 6 February 2001.\nThe panel, complementing ECOSOC's theme on the role of the UN in supporting the efforts of African countries to achieve sustainable development, focused on The Challenge of Ending Rural Poverty: Opportunities and Options for Africa. It coincided with the release of the International Fund for Agricultural Development's (IFAD) Rural Poverty Report 2001 (see Go Between 84 ).\nThe panel was chaired by ECOSOC President, Ambassador Martin Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon). It opened with an overview of rural poverty in Africa by Mr. Fawzi Al-Sultan, IFAD President. Mr. Al-Sultan noted that 75% of the world's poorest people live in rural areas\u0096with the highest proportion in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). He said this figure will only drop to about 60% by 2020. A focus on rural poverty and agricultural development was crucial to the reduction of overall poverty, he said, adding that \u0093the neglect of agriculture, in terms of both international development cooperation and domestic resource allocation, must be redressed if we hope to achieve the challenging poverty targets of the Millennium Summit.\u0094\nGary Howe, Director of the Eastern and Southern African Division of IFAD, pointed out that poverty reduction \u0093never actually took off in Africa\u0094 despite the fact that most rural poor are not unemployed, nor for the most part marginalized in areas affected by land degradation and desertification. Among the problems he highlighted were poor access to health care and education; \u0093very unequal access\u0094 to land and water; poor access to technology; poor communications and transportation infrastructure; and an urban bias in development expenditure.\nHe also noted that official development assistance (ODA), including from international financial institutions (IFIs), to the agricultural sector had significantly declined. Describing poverty as \u0093a social and political fact,\u0094 he called for improved governance, direct integration of the rural poor into decision-making processes that affect their livelihoods, and expanded national development support for small-scale agriculture in association with the private sector. At the international level, he supported the abolition of trade barriers, which Mr. Howe said had cost Africa more than that for which debt reduction could ever compensate.\nProfessor Michael Lipton of UK-based Sussex University also argued for a realignment of aid toward agriculture. Concurring with other panellists that SSA was marked by extreme land distribution inequity, he highlighted the necessity for improved water and irrigation management. Irrigation, he said, had been key to reducing rural poverty in South and East Asia, while in SSA only 3% of arable land was being properly irrigated. He noted that on average 50% of household income in SSA was spent on food staples, whose production yields were \u0093crawling.\u0094\nMr. Lipton called for land reform, which he said could be achieved in a \u0093market-friendly and non-confiscatory\u0094 manner. This would prove labour intensive and therefore increase demand for the poor's labour which in turn could improve their bargaining power. Farmers would be able to increase staple yields and grow enough to feed themselves. It would also be possible for them to accumulate capital for reinvestment by saving money previously spent on purchasing staple foods. Owning land would enable farmers to secure credit previously denied them.\nPelucy Ntambirweki, Executive Director of Ugandan Women's Effort to Save Orphans (WESO), highlighted the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic on rural poor. She described the disease not only as a health problem that had caused enormous suffering and destabilization of national health systems, but as a critical development issue.\nResponding to a description of rural to urban migration patterns as \u0093the migration of despair,\u0094 Ms. Ntambirweki noted that once individuals became sick and weak with AIDS they migrate back to the countryside. This places enormous strain on rural areas. Her organization had found that charitable \u0093handouts\u0094 did not have much impact on rural poverty, and she called for long-term economic empowerment of households, in particular for women, including education, access to credit, and training in modern methods of farming.\nContact: Hanifa Mezoui, Chief, Non-Governmental Organizations Section, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), Room DC1-1480, United Nations, New York NY 10017, United States, telephone +1-212/963 8652, fax +1-212/963 9248, e-mail < mezoui@un.org >, website ( www.un.org ).\nAID AND REFORM IN AFRICA\nForeign aid can help key economic reforms take root in developing countries, but only if recipient governments and their people broadly support the need for change, according to a World Bank report on the ways development aid influences economic policy in Africa. Without such \u0093country ownership,\u0094 external cajoling or donor-imposed \u0093conditionality\u0094 is unlikely to make poor countries adopt reforms they oppose, says Aid and Reform in Africa: Lessons from Ten Case Studies.\nWhere political leaders are committed to reform, and capable civil servants and community groups can implement change, aid increases public confidence in the reform process and attracts greater private investment in national economies. In this way, foreign aid can help deepen reform commitments and support high growth rates, says the report.\nWhen releasing the report, the World Bank said rich countries should honor their UN commitment to devote 0.7% of their annual gross domestic product (GDP) to development aid and open their markets to developing country exports. Development assistance to Africa has fallen drastically from US$32 per head in 1990 to just US$19 in 1998, despite clear evidence of aid's effectiveness in countries with effective economic and social policies, noted the Bank.\n\u0093It is painfully ironic that just at the time when many African governments are putting in place effective social and economic policies and committing to reform, development aid is being cut,\u0094 said World Bank President James Wolfensohn. \u0093This is exactly the wrong message for donors to send. African leaders are determined as never before to lead their own renaissance, but what they also need is increased development assistance to support those reforms and access to developed country markets. Rich countries need reminding that their current levels of foreign aid, at some 0.24% of yearly GDP, fall far short of the 0.7% target they promised to meet. The difference between these figures is worth a hundred billion dollars a year\u0096for millions, this is the difference between life and death.\u0094\nThe report examines ten national case studies during the 1980s and 1990s comprising C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.\nIt says the studies reconfirm development assistance has little or no positive influence in poor countries that avoid economic reforms that could spur economic growth and reduce their incidence of poverty. While aid donors increasingly favor developing countries that can use their foreign aid effectively, the report warns that donors must continue to be selective. Where bilateral donors in particular give aid to national recipients regardless of their poor economic track record, \u0093they may be insulating developing countries from the need to adopt reforms which would greatly benefit the social and economic well-being of their people.\u0094\nThe report concludes that using \u0093conditionality\u0094 to coerce developing countries into reforms, such as stabilizing their exchange rates or fostering an independent judicial system, are largely ineffective. Countries that have successfully reformed have had clear political movements leading to these changes. Countries that have made less progress typically have had powerful vested interests blocking change. Either way, economic policies are primarily domestically grown, it says.\n\u0093This report shows that aid cannot 'buy' reform in poor countries that are flatly opposed to it,\u0094 said Shanta Devarajan, co-author of the report and Chief Economist of the World Bank's Human Development Network. \u0093Without 'country-ownership' of a national development strategy, even the most generous and well-intentioned aid packages will have little or no impact in improving the quality of people's lives.\u0094\nContact: David Dollar, World Bank, 1818 H Street NW, Washington DC 20433, United States, e-mail < Ddollar@worldbank.org >.

The report of the Vienna-based UN body warns that widespread overuse of such drugs is becoming a socially-acceptable habit, especially in developed countries, as controlled substances are readily used and prescribed for psychological or social problems. Some reasons for the oversupply of controlled substances\u0096such as benzodiazepines and other amphetamine-type stimulants\u0096include loose regulation, unreliable estimates and information concerning medical needs, aggressive marketing techniques, and improper or even unethical prescription practices.\n\u0093Easy availability leads to over-consumption of such substances,\u0094 according to the INCB, \u0093either in the form of drug abuse or by fueling a culture of drug taking to deal with a variety of non-medical problems.\u0094\nThe under-consumption of narcotic drugs for the relief of pain and suffering in a number of nations\u0096especially developing countries\u0096was highlighted in last year's report. By focusing this year on the excessive consumption of drugs in developed countries, the INCB observed that \u0093the world situation is characterized by under-supply of narcotic drugs for medical purposes in one part of the world, and excessive consumption of controlled substances in the other part.\u0094\nInsomnia, anxiety, obesity and child hyperactivity, as well as various kinds of pain are listed among the most common problems treated by prescribing pyschotropic substances. The INCB says is it especially concerned that preference is given to \u0093quick solutions\u0094 without looking at long-term effects, as prolonged and excessive consumption of such drugs could result in dependency and other physical and mental suffering.\nThe INCB is urging government authorities, health care professionals, pharmaceutical companies and consumers themselves to adopt \u0093more responsible and ethical behaviour and adhere to a more rational prescription culture.\u0094\nContact: INCB, Vienna International Centre, PO Box 500, A-1400 Vienna, Austria, telephone +43-1/26060 4163, fax +43-1/26060 5867, e-mail < secretariat@incb.org >, website ( www.incb.org ).\nUNFPA: REDUCING MATERNAL MORTALITY\nComplications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death and disability for women aged 15 to 49 in most developing countries. Worldwide, some 500,000 women die each year from causes related to pregnancy, childbirth and unsafe abortion such as haemorrhage, toxaemia and obstructed labour. Many more suffer from infections or long-term injuries, according to a report from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).\nMaternal Mortality Update 1998-1999 says that more than 99% of these deaths and injuries occur in developing countries, and the vast majority could be prevented if women had access to basic and emergency medical care during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period.\n\u0093Yet only 53% of pregnant women in developing countries deliver with the help of a skilled attendant,\u0094 according to UNFPA, \u0093and millions of women have no means of getting to a hospital in case of major obstetric complications.\u0094\nThe report describes UNFPA-supported activities to prevent maternal deaths, including:\n-- family planning information and services;\n-- prenatal, delivery and post-natal care at the primary level and referrals to higher care levels for the management\nof obstetric complications; and\n-- prevention of abortion, management of the consequences of abortion, and post-abortion counseling.\nIn 1998 and 1999 the Fund spent an estimated US$105 million for such activities in 89 developing countries, and another US$3.4 million for regional and global efforts. Non-governmental organizations are involved in designing, planning, and implementing UNFPA-supported maternal health programmes in 44 countries.\nUNFPA country offices are striving to reduce maternal death by:\n-- upgrading primary health-care facilities to make essential and emergency obstetric care more available,\nespecially in rural and under-served areas;\n-- providing equipment and supplies for prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care of mothers and newborns;\n-- training health service providers in various aspects of maternal care, including life-saving skills for emergency\ncases;\n-- providing vehicles to transport women with obstetric complications; and\n-- mobilizing communities to fully use available services.\nContact: Suleman Chaudhary, Technical Support Division, UNFPA, 220 East 42nd Street, New York NY 10017, United States, fax +1-212/370 0201, website ( www.unfpa.org/tpd/mmupdate ).\nWORLD POPULATION PROSPECTS REPORT\nThe world population, which reached 6.1 billion in mid-2000, is growing at an annual rate of 1.3% or 77 million people per year, according to World Population Prospects: The 2000 Revision.\nPublished by the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the report says six countries account for half of this annual growth. They are India (21%), China (12%), Pakistan (5%), Nigeria (4%), Bangladesh (4%), and Indonesia (3%). By 2050, world population is expected to be between 7.9 billion and 10.9 billion.\nThe population of more developed regions, currently 1.2 billion, is anticipated to change little during the next 50 years because fertility levels are expected to remain below replacement level. And by mid-century, the populations of 39 countries are projected to be smaller than today. These include Japan and Germany (each 14% smaller), Italy and Hungary (each 25% smaller) and the Russian Federation, Georgia and Ukraine (each between 28% and 40% smaller).\nIn less-developed regions, the population is projected to rise steadily from 4.9 billion in 2000 to 8.2 billion in 2050. This projection assumes continuing declines in fertility; in the absence of such declines, the population of less-developed regions would reach 11.9 billion.\nParticularly rapid growth is expected among the group of 48 countries classified as least developed\u0096their population is expected to nearly triple between 2000 and 2050, passing from 658 million to 1.8 billion, despite the fact that their fertility is projected to decline markedly in the future.\nHowever, the report indicates HIV/AIDS will have an increasing impact on morbidity, mortality and population loss. During the next five years, the number of excess deaths because of AIDS is estimated at 15.5 million. The long-term impact of the epidemic \u0093remains dire,\u0094 warned the United Nations. \u0093For the 45 most affected countries, the expectation of life at birth has already been reduced by nearly three years. By 2015, expectation of life is projected to stand at 60 years, five years lower than it would have been in the absence of HIV/AIDS.\u0094\nOther trends discussed in the report include the number of older persons (60 years or over) across the world, which will nearly triple from 606 million today to nearly two billion by 2050. And international migration is projected to remain high during the 21st century. The more developed regions are expected to remain net receivers of international migrants, with an average gain of about two million per year over the next 50 years.\nContact: Director, Population Division, United Nations, Room DC2-1950, 2 UN Plaza, New York NY 10017, United States, telephone +1-212/963 4838, fax +1-212/963 2147.

The Governing Body decided to continue evaluating the situation with a view to promoting stronger protection for trade union leaders and effective punishment for those who violate their rights.\nThe meeting also adopted a US$472.4 million budget, which contains new and expanded proposals. These include an increase in the number of regionally-based ILO specialists working in the global campaign against child labour, especially in its worst forms.\nThe Governing Body, which meets three times a year, takes decisions on ILO policy, decides the agenda of the International Labour Conference, adopts the draft Programme and Budget of the Organization for submission to the Conference, and elects the Director-General.\nContact: Department of Communication, ILO, 4 route des Morillons, CH-1211 Geneva 22, Switzerland, telephone +41-22/799 7940, fax +41-22/799 8577, e-mail < presse@ilo.org >, website ( www.ilo.org ).\nUNCC GOVERNING COUNCIL\nThe Governing Council of the United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC) held a special session on 15 February 2001 in Geneva. Among other things, the Council elected Ambassador Sverre Bergh Johansen of Norway as President, and Ambassador Jaynarain Meetoo of Mauritius as Vice-President. The UNCC, a subsidiary organ of the United Nations Security Council, was established to process claims and pay compensation for direct losses and damage suffered by individuals, corporations, governments and international organizations as a result of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990 and 1991.\nThe composition of the Governing Council, which is the policy-making organ of the UNCC, is the same as that of the 15-member Security Council at any given time. The Governing Council makes decisions on recommendations made by the panels of Commissioners regarding compensation for claimants. The panels of Commissioners review and evaluate the claims submitted by governments on behalf of their nationals, their companies or on their own behalf. More than 2.6 million claims have been received by the Commission within the filing deadlines. The total asserted value of these claims (the amount sought by the claimants) amounts to over US$300 billion. Ninety-six governments have filed claims, as well as 13 offices of three international organizations, which have filed claims on behalf of individuals not in a position to submit their claims through a government.\nThe Commission has resolved over 99% of the claims submitted, consisting of:\n-- those of individuals for departure from Kuwait or Iraq;\n-- for serious personal injury or death;\n-- for losses up to US$100,000;\n-- for losses over US$100,000;\n-- the claims of corporations, other private legal entities and public sector enterprises; and\n-- those of governments and international organizations.\nCompensation awarded has amounted to over US$32 billion, out of a total amount claimed of approximately US$83 billion. Funds to pay the awards of compensation are drawn from the United Nations Compensation Fund, which receives up to 30% of the revenue generated by export of Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products. The Compensation Fund receives 25% of the proceeds under through the \u0093oil-for-food\u0094 mechanism in accordance with Security Council resolution 1330, adopted in December 2000.\nContact: UN Compensation Commission, Villa La Pelouse, Palais des Nations, CH-1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland, telephone +41-22/917 3600, fax +41-22/917 0069, website ( www.uncc.ch ).\nUN NARCOTICS PANEL\nNations should give renewed priority to drug abuse prevention and rehabilitation, and the United Nations should do more to help Member States combat the rising tide of amphetamine-type stimulants while continuing efforts to reduce both the supply and demand for illicit drugs. These were among key directives issued by the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, which held a two-week meeting in March 2001 in Vienna (Austria).\nParticipants reviewed how governments and the UN were \u0093living up to the goals and target dates\u0094 called for by the 1998 General Assembly Special Session on the world drug problem (see NGLS Roundup, July 1998 ). At the March meeting delegates of the 53-member Commission also heard the first progress report of Pino Arlacchi, Executive Director of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP).\nSpeakers noted important achievements by governments working with UNDCP toward eliminating coca in Bolivia and Peru, and opium poppy in Afghanistan, Laos and Viet Nam. At the same time they recognized \u0093the vulnerability of many countries in Africa and the linkage between the drug problem and poverty, unemployment, regional conflicts, civil wars and the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\u0094\nThe Commission voted to place three \u0093party drugs\u0094 and one sedative under the control regime of the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and to tighten the watch over two common chemicals that are often diverted into illicit channels for processing heroin and cocaine. It called for strengthened dialogue with donor and recipient countries as a way of enhancing programme delivery.\nAmong other things, Mr. Arlacchi expressed his commitment to continue strengthening the quality of UNDCP programme performance including changes in its work methods and financial management system, and systematic evaluation of project results. He also confirmed that UNDCP would move to results-based budgeting.\nContact: Jonathan Lucas, Commission on Narcotic Drugs, United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, Vienna International Centre, PO Box 500, A-1400 Vienna, Austria, telephone +43-1/26060 3400, fax +43-1/26060 5885, website ( www.odccp.org/cnd.html ).\nINTERNATIONAL JUTE STUDY GROUP\nNegotiations held in Geneva in March 2001 resulted in the establishment of an International Jute Study Group. This legal instrument replaces the International Agreement on Jute and Jute Products, which expired in April 2000. The Conference on Jute and Jute Products was held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\nWhen closing the conference, UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens Ricupero welcomed the new agreement and said its main innovation was its involvement of the private sector. The private sector had a potentially key role to play, he said, for example by identifying sources of funding for the modernization of the jute industry and by developing new end-uses for jute, a biodegradable and renewable natural resource. In many respects the future would be increasingly determined by the growing interrelationship between trade and the environment, he added.\nThe new entity succeeds the International Jute Organization, which was established under the first International Agreement in 1982. The Study Group is intended to promote the expansion of international trade in jute and jute products by maintaining existing markets and developing new ones, including the introduction of new products and the development of new end-uses.\nIt is also aimed at facilitating the improvement of structural conditions in the jute sector by enhancing productivity and quality, and promoting the application of new processes and technologies.\nThe Study Group, which may subsequently apply to be designated as an international commodity body, may undertake, sponsor or supervise projects designed to improve the economic well-being of the millions of persons working in the sector, especially in Bangladesh and India, the top two producing countries.\nThe new instrument will enter into force when states together accounting for 60% of trade (imports and exports combined) in jute and jute products have notified the United Nations Secretary-General of their provisional application or definitive acceptance of its provisions.\nShould the requirements for entry into force not be met by 31 December 2001, states that have notified their acceptance or provisional application may decide to put its terms of reference into force among themselves.\nThe Study Group will remain in force for eight years and may be extended for up to two periods of two years.\nContact: Erica Meltzer, Press Officer, UNCTAD, Palais des Nations, CH-1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland, telephone +41-22/907 5828, fax +41-22/907 0043, e-mail < press@unctad.org >, website ( www.unctad.org ).\nUNICEF REPORT ON CHILD MARRIAGE\nThe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which said that half of all girls in some countries are married by the time they reach age 18, in March 2001 called for a global campaign to prevent the phenomenon of child marriage.\nA UNICEF report, entitled Early Marriage: Child Spouses, discusses the reasons early marriage continues, and may even be on the rise among extremely poor populations.\n\u0093Forcing children, especially girls, into early marriages can be physically and emotionally harmful,\u0094 said Carol Bellamy, UNICEF Executive Director. \u0093It violates their rights to personal freedom and growth. Yet until now there has been virtually no attempt to examine child marriage as a human rights violation in and of itself.\u0094\nBy analyzing child marriage as a violation of a child's basic rights, the report seeks to build momentum for change. It is \u0093another step in a growing movement to end the silent despair of millions of children, especially girls, who are being shuttered away in lives often full of misery and pain,\u0094 said Ms. Bellamy.\nThe report examines many of the implications of child marriage, from its restriction of personal freedom to its impact on health and education. For both boys and girls, early marriage has profound physical, intellectual, psychological and emotional consequences, cutting off educational opportunities and chances for personal growth. For girls, in addition, it will almost certainly mean premature pregnancy\u0096which causes higher rates of maternal mortality\u0096and is likely to lead to a lifetime of domestic and sexual subservience.\nTeenage girls are also more susceptible than mature women to sexually-transmitted infections, says the report, including HIV/AIDS. Their vulnerability is dangerously increased because of the false belief in many places that if a man sleeps with a virgin, he'll be cured of HIV/AIDS.\nChild marriages can be found across the globe, but are pervasive in parts of Africa and South Asia. The percentage of girls aged 15-19 in selected countries who are already married include Democratic Republic of Congo (74%), Niger (70%), Afghanistan (54%), Bangladesh (51%), Honduras (30%) and Iraq (28%). Poverty is one of the major factors underpinning child marriage.\nTo prevent child marriage a wide range of individuals and organizations\u0096from community leaders to international bodies\u0096must take action, says the report. A first step is to inform parents and young people about the negative implications of child marriage so they can choose to prevent it. Education is key in this process, according to UNICEF. Persuading parents to keep their daughters in school is critical for the overall development of girls\u0096and in the postponement of marriage.\nFor girls who are already married, services must be developed to counsel them on issues ranging from abuse to reproduction.\nContact: Shima Islam or Mitchie Topper, UNICEF, 3 UN Plaza, New York NY 10017, United States, telephone +1-212/824 6949 or 303 7910, e-mail < sislam@unicef.org > or < mtopper@unicef.org >, website ( www.unicef.org/hpphotocaption/7mar01-earlymarriage.htm ).\nUNDP GENDER MAINSTREAMING STUDY\nThe first attempt to systematically analyze success of the United Nations Development Fund's (UNDP) efforts to promote gender mainstreaming in sub-Saharan Africa focuses on gender-related activities of its Africa Bureau in two areas: poverty eradication and governance, and women-specific initiatives.\nAssessment of Gender Mainstreaming in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Review of UNDP Supported Activities was based on a sample of 18 of 45 countries in the region and includes 74 UNDP-funded programmes and 115 projects. The study grades and ranks the initiatives according to a Gender Mainstreaming Index, ranging from zero to eight.\nThe index was developed to facilitate a quantitative evaluation and comparison. The assessment was initiated by UNDP in cooperation with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs' Division for the Advancement of Women.\nOf the 97 poverty eradication initiatives examined, the study reports that 43% included some gender analysis while only 33% employed a gender specialist. Overall, the study finds that \u0093relatively little has been done to mainstream gender in poverty eradication initiatives in Africa.\u0094\nIt recommends a renewed commitment to gender mainstreaming through, among other things:\n-- a clearer targeting of the poor and women;\n-- budgeting a larger proportion of funds directly for gender mainstreaming; and\n-- supporting projects that directly transfer assets to women, educate women and improve their health.\nIn the area of governance, the study notes that women represent the highest proportion of the marginalized and neediest groups in Africa. Women are under-represented in the national decision-making bodies of all African countries, although ten of the 18 countries registered increases in the representation of women in national legislative bodies between 1994 and 2000.\nOut of 59 governance initiatives examined, the study found only six based on gender analysis, indicating \u0093a lack of focus on gender in the conceptualization of the programme or project.\u0094 Only 18 of the initiatives included gender specialists, and 85% \u0093had little or no gender mainstreaming component.\u0094\nWomen-specific initiatives can play an important complementary role in gender mainstreaming and represent those where systematic and concrete steps have been taken to include gender in the project design, says the study. Of the 18 countries under review, 15 had women-specific programmes and projects. However, the combined number of such programmes and projects totaled only 33. The study found that \u0093where UNDP was a participant in these initiatives, it was also in the majority of cases the primary funder.\u0094\nIt said UNDP \u0093made considerable efforts to promote gender mainstreaming at the policy level. [Its] financial commitments include the goal that at least 20% of its global budget be allocated and disbursed to promote the advancement of women.\u0094 However, the study notes that to a large degree the process of gender mainstreaming is still in its early stages in many countries.\nThe results of the study will contribute to the development of policy guidance on how to redirect mainstream programming to incorporate gender equality as a development objective in the substantive areas of UNDP's work. These include policy formulation, planning, implementation, evaluation and decision-making processes at the country level.\nThe long-term objective of the study is to assist national governments and civil society in implementation of the recommendations contained in the Declaration and Platform for Action of the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women, with emphasis on supporting governments in mainstreaming a gender perspective into all policies and programmes.\nGender mainstreaming, as defined by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. Gender mainstreaming aims to make women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and social spheres so that women and men benefit equally.\nContact: Tsu-Wei Chang, Division for the Advancement of Women, DESA, United Nations, New York NY 10017, United States, telephone +1-212/963 8370, website ( www.un.org/womenwatch ) or Laufey Love, Development and Human Rights Section, Department of Public Information, United Nations, New York NY 10017, United States, telephone +1-212/963 3507.\nWORLD ASSEMBLY ON AGEING\nAt its 54th session the UN General Assembly decided to convene a Second World Assembly on Ageing next year. The event will be held on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Vienna World Assembly on Ageing and will be devoted to reviewing the outcome of the first World Assembly. It will also aim to \u0093adopt a revised plan of action and long-term strategy on ageing, encompassing its periodic reviews, in the context of a society for all ages.\u0094 The Second Assembly on Ageing will be held in Madrid (Spain) in April 2002.\nPreparations for the World Assembly have been entrusted to the Commission for Social Development, which is acting as the Preparatory Committee (PrepCom). It held an organizational session from 26 February-2 March 2001 in New York.\nWhile the PrepCom approved a decision to request the Secretary-General to submit a report on abuse against older persons, as a contribution to the elaboration of a revised action plan, the organizational session was suspended without resolving the matters before it. These included accreditation and participation of NGOs at the World Assembly and preparatory process, as well the rules of procedure and format for the event. It decided to resume the session on 30 April-1 May and again in November.\n\u0093We have failed,\u0094 said Committee Chairman Felipe Paolillo (Uruguay), who expressed frustration with what were described as meagre results. Mr. Paolillo said he hoped that an atmosphere more conducive to reaching agreement would prevail at the resumed session.\nGrowing concern over the intensifying speed and scale of global ageing was evident during the session's general discussion, as speakers drew attention to the demographic, social and economic changes that have occurred since adoption of the 1982 Action Plan. They also highlighted ways in which those changes had affected their countries. A combination of increased life expectancy and low fertility rates had added some 20 years to the average life span, bringing global life expectancy to 66 years.\nAccording to documentation presented at the session, today one out of every ten persons is 60 years or older. By 2050, one out of five persons will be 60 years or older. Some 55% of older persons are women, and approximately 51% of older persons live in urban areas.\nThe rapid increase in the number of older people in the world represents a challenge to the institutional frameworks and capacity of many governments to sustain development and ensure the well-being of their population, noted many participants.\nContact: Alexandre Sidorenko, UN Programme on Ageing, Division for Social Policy and Development, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Room DC2-1358, 2 UN Plaza, New York NY 10017, United States, telephone +1-212/963 0500, fax +1-212/963 3062, website ( www.un.org/esa/socdev/ageing.htm ).\nCOMMISSION ON MACROECONOMICS AND HEALTH\nIn January 2000 Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director-General of the World Health Organization, launched a Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (CMH) aimed at clarifying the relation between health, economic development and poverty reduction.\nThe CMH, chaired by Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, comprises 18 representatives of governments, international economic agencies and universities. Among its members are former ministers of finance and representatives of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Economic Commission on Africa (ECA), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\nThe purpose of the CMH is to produce a series of studies on health care intervention to foster economic growth in developing countries. It will also produce and propose a set of health measures to help minimize poverty and maximize development in these countries.\nThe final CMH report will be released in December 2001 and be disseminated at the 2002 World Health Assembly. The report is expected to have a similar global impact as the 1989 Brundtland Report entitled Our Common Future, which established environmental degradation and sustainable development as some of the key concerns on the global agenda.\nDuring the 1990s issues such as debt relief, international trade, accessibility of essential drugs to those most in need, the HIV/AIDS crisis, and growing health care costs have demonstrated that health plays a central role in the world economy, according to the CMH. And there is growing evidence that in the poorest nations, health care crises can create critical barriers to development, while improvements in the condition of a population's overall health contributes to higher economic growth and poverty alleviation.\nThe World Health Organization and United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs organized a panel discussion about the Commission on 9 February 2001 at UN headquarters in New York. According to Mr. Sachs in his keynote address, it is critically important that the health crisis of the poorest nations be addressed, and that globalization is made to work for all. (The CMH final report will assess the health crisis in the poorest countries and analyze subsequent adverse economic development.)\nHe said that poor health is one of the fundamental reasons some poor regions are unable to escape poverty since a sick population is less productive than a healthy one. In the least developed countries, high infant/child mortality rates and corresponding high birth rates require great investments in the health and education sectors, said Mr. Sachs.\nDisease tends to isolate countries and regions from global investments and trade. Foreign investments are low in the highest disease areas, and diseases such as HIV/AIDS are increasingly cutting off the most affected African countries from global trade. Mr. Sachs also emphasized that in order to achieve a truly globalized world, the disease burden must be brought down. To achieve this investments are required not only in health care, but in related fields such as education and empowerment of the girl-child.\nMr. Sachs identified debt reduction of the highly indebted poor countries as an important measure to address the global health crisis. However, he said, debt reduction alone is not sufficient. In order to achieve global goals the developed countries will also need to invest heavily in this area.\nInformation concerning the global health crisis will be presented in a CMH preliminary report, to be issued in July 2001.\nContact: Sergio Spinaci, Executive Secretary of the CMH, WHO, 20 avenue Appia, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland, e-mail < spinacis@who.ch >, website ( www.who.int ).\nDyna Arhin-Tenkorang, Senior Economist and Assistant to the Chairman of the CMH, Center for International Development at Harvard University, Boston MA, United States, e-mail < dyna_arhin-tenkorang@harvard.edu >, website ( www.cid.harvard.edu/cidcmh ).\nICC PREPCOM HOLDS SEVENTH SESSION\nThe Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) for the International Criminal Court (ICC), which held its seventh session at UN headquarters in New York from 26 February-9 March 2001, continued its work on rules and political arrangements for effective operation of the future Court.\nPrepCom Chair Philippe Kirsch (Canada) described the session as \u0093exceptionally productive\u0094 after making substantial progress toward determining the shape and functioning of the Court. The representative from the Netherlands announced to the PrepCom that a suitable location had been found for the Court in The Hague.\nFive working groups met during the session, and two new working groups were created on the Court's first-year budget and on principles of agreement between the Court and the Netherlands.\nThe groups working on the Relationship Agreement between the Court and the United Nations, the Financial Regulations and Rules, and the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the Court indicated their work would be completed at the PrepCom's next session, scheduled for 24 September-5 October 2001. The working groups on Rules of Procedure of the Assembly of States Parties, and on the Crime of Aggression, also met during the session.\nThe main challenge in the draft Relationship Agreement between the Court and the UN concerned the independence of the Court and mutual recognition of the two institutions. Christian Maquiera (Chile), Coordinator for the Working Group, introduced a discussion paper describing, among other things, cooperation between the Security Council and the Court, rules concerning exchange of information, and the protection of confidentiality.\nThe discussion on Financial Regulations and Rules of the Court dealt with the budget, the scale of assessment, choice of currency for the Court, creation of a trust fund for victims, as well as issues dealing with other income and voluntary contributions. Georg Witschel (Germany), Coordinator for the Working Group, introduced an outline for setting up the Court's proposed programme budget for each financial period, as well as additional terms of reference governing the audit of the Court.\nIssues in the draft Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the Court included the extension of that status to defence counsel and victims appearing before the Court. Phakiso Mochochoko (Lesotho), Coordinator for the Working Group, introduced a paper describing the legal status and judicial personality of the Court; the exercise of its functions outside headquarters; cooperation with authorities of states Parties; and articles on the immunity of the Court, its property, funds and assets.\nSeid Mirzaee-Yengejeh (Iran), Coordinator for the Working Group on draft Rules of Procedure of the Assembly of States Parties, said that there had been a \u0093fruitful exchange\u0094 of ideas including the scope of application of rules of procedure and the relationship of those rules with the Statute, and the relevance of repeating provisions of the Statute in the text.\nThe Coordinator of the Working Group on the Crime of Aggression, Sylvia Fernandez de Gurmendi (Argentina), said that during discussions it had been recognized that the UN Charter gave the responsibility of determining the crime of aggression to the Security Council.\nThere was still the question, however, of what mechanism would apply if the Council failed to recognize that a crime of aggression had been committed. She said that some delegates had proposed that in such a situation, the Court could ask the General Assembly to recommend whether it should continue with the case.\nThe Working Group also considered the conditions of the exercise of jurisdiction, as well as the definition of the crime of aggression. Ms. de Gurmendi noted that there was continued division between countries preferring a general definition of the crime, and those desiring a highly detailed list of specific and relevant actions.\nSome delegations emphasized individual responsibility, while others felt that the PrepCom should consider intent as well as the rights of the accused.\nA total of 139 states have signed the Rome Statute of the ICC, and 29 have ratified it. The Court will come into being when 60 states have ratified the treaty.\nContact: Coalition for an International Criminal Court, 777 UN Plaza, New York NY 10017, United States, telephone +1-212/687 2176, e-mail < cicc@iccnow.org >, website ( www.iccnow.org ).\nICAO ON AVIATION SAFETY AND SECURITY FOR 2000\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which is based in Montreal, has completed an analysis of preliminary information available on aviation safety and security for 2000.\nRegarding safety last year (excluding aircraft accidents caused by acts of unlawful interference), there were 18 aircraft accidents with passenger fatalities in scheduled air services worldwide involving aircraft with a maximum take-off mass of more than 2,250 kg. The number of passenger fatalities was 755. In 1999, there were 499 passenger fatalities from 21 accidents.\n\u0093Due to the higher number of fatalities in 2000,\u0094 according to ICAO, \u0093the accident rate (measured in passenger fatalities per 100 million passenger-kilometres) also rose, from approximately 0.02 in 1999 to 0.025 in 2000.\u0094\nFor non-scheduled air services, there were 22 accidents involving passenger fatalities for aircraft with a maximum take-off mass of more than 2,250 kg., both in 2000 and in 1999. (The latter included six involving all-cargo services with passengers onboard). These accidents accounted for 291 passenger fatalities in 2000 compared with 129 in 1999.\nRegarding security, 27 acts of unlawful interference took place in 2000 (including aircraft accidents caused by such acts). In these 53 persons were killed and 46 were injured.\nContact: External Relations and Public Information Office, ICAO, 999 University Street, Montreal, Quebec H3C 5H7, Canada, telephone + 1-514/954 8219, fax 1-514/954 6077, website ( www.icao.int ).\nAD HOC COMMITTEE ON TERRORISM\nThe General Assembly Ad Hoc Committee on Terrorism, which held its fifth session from 12-23 February 2001 in New York, focused on efforts to further elaborate a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.\nThe Committee, chaired by Rohan Perera (Sri Lanka), used as a basis for its discussion a draft text submitted by the Indian delegation at the 51st session of the General Assembly. The text expresses deep concern about the worldwide escalation of acts of terrorism, which endanger or take innocent lives, jeopardize fundamental freedoms and seriously impair the dignity of human beings.\nIt also stresses that suppression of terrorist acts is an essential element in the maintenance of international peace and security, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.\nThe text seeks to define terrorism, urge domestic legislation and the establishment of jurisdiction, and ensure that states Parties not grant asylum to any person involved in a terrorist act. It also addresses questions of liability, extradition and custody.\nAmong other provisions, states Parties would be obliged to offer the greatest measure of assistance in connection with investigations of criminal or extradition proceedings, including assistance in obtaining evidence. The text has annexes on exclusion of political offence, and procedures for mutual legal assistance and extradition. The convention itself would enter into force 30 days after ratification by 22 states.\nDuring discussion Malaysia, on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, proposed that a clear definition of terrorism be established so that it could be \u0093differentiated from the legitimate struggles of people under foreign occupation for national liberation, as recognized by relevant resolutions and declarations of the United Nations.\u0094 Pakistan added that the question of terrorist acts by paramilitary or military personnel of states should not be excluded.\nChile, on behalf of the Rio Group, agreed that the Committee should deal with the legal description of terrorism, on which other provisions of the convention would depend. Chile proposed that the approach to, and structure of, the legal description be centred on the usual purpose of terrorism. It described this as producing fear in the population or forcing a government or international organization to take, or refrain from taking, some action.\nSouth Africa said the nature and scope of the convention needed to be established; it should identify relevant criminal acts and their consequences, and elaborate a legal framework with a high degree of specificity and clarity. South Africa felt the convention should have two objectives: to prevent terrorist acts, and where impossible to prosecute such acts. Mutual legal assistance, as well as interstate cooperation, were crucial elements.\nSweden, on behalf of the European Union, said that in the international community's legitimate efforts to suppress terrorism, human rights and freedoms must always be respected. Sweden stressed that there should be no safe havens for terrorists or impunity for their acts, and it agreed that a legal definition of terrorism could help in this regard.\nThe United States reaffirmed its condemnation of terrorism in all forms, whatever the motive or whomever the author. That included, it said, condemnation of state-sponsored terrorism. However, the US reiterated its position that the term \u0093terrorism\u0094 was not appropriate when used to describe the conduct of states.\nThe Philippines felt that the Committee should go beyond a \u0093prosecute or extradite\u0094 regime\u0096and rules that merely prohibited the use of a territory for terrorist purposes\u0096to rules involving the responsibility of the state. It agreed with South Africa that the scope and definition of offences was an important issue. It also supported a proposal to give due consideration to the victims of terrorism.\nContact: Codification Division, Office of Legal Affairs, United Nations, New York NY 10017, United States, fax +1-212/963 1963.

The United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD) will serve as an emergency logistics base and storage site aimed at allowing the UN to respond to crises at a moment's notice.\n\u0093This base is the first of its kind and we're very excited about it,\u0094 said Catherine Bertini, WFP Executive Director. \u0093It will serve as a global emergency headquarters [and] a launching pad that will enable us to respond to emergencies even more quickly.\u0094\nUNHRD contains stocks of emergency food aid and mobile cooking facilities, medicine, shelter materials, electric generators, water treatment systems and personal safety provisions, which can be immediately dispatched whenever and wherever crisis strikes.\nBut unlike other existing humanitarian aid facilities, it will also include rapid response equipment such as a dedicated fleet of trucks, shipping containers, emergency telecom equipment and mobile offices\u0096all the logistics equipment necessary to instantly launch a humanitarian operation.\nWFP manages the base on behalf of partners that include the Italian government, non-governmental organizations, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and the World Health Organization (WHO). Other aid organizations will be invited to participate, according to WFP. It was named by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to oversee the UNHRD because of its more than 35 years of logistics experience. As the UN's primary transport arm for humanitarian aid, WFP ships thousands of tons of food and other aid goods around the world each year.\n\u0093The ability of aid agencies to quickly help people trapped in wars and natural disasters is a must,\u0094 Ms. Bertini said. \u0093But often when crisis strikes, time is lost because we must often request aid and equipment from donors, and then assemble and ship it.\u0094 She said UNHRD provides \u0093stocks of the necessary aid and tools on hand and a specialized team that can coordinate and move it all within the first 24 hours.\u0094\nUNHRD has been operative since June 2000 and has already organized several emergency airlifts to Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kosovo, El Salvador, India, Guinea, Afghanistan and Mozambique.\nContact: Jeff Rowland, Public Affairs Officer, WFP, Via Cesare Giulio Viola 68, I-00148 Rome, Italy, telephone +39-06/6513 2971, fax +39-06/6513 2840, e-mail < jeffrey.rowland@wfp.org >, website ( www.wfp.org ).\nINTERNATIONAL COCOA AGREEMENT\nA new international cocoa agreement, which grants the private sector a bigger role in international cooperation in the world cocoa economy, was launched in Geneva in March 2001.\nParticipants in the United Nations Cocoa Conference described the pact as much more flexible and \u0093moral\u0094 than previous agreements, which had contained a number of economic clauses aimed at correcting market imbalances. The new agreement, they said, depends more on the good faith and political will of the private sector in cocoa producer and consumer countries, as well as governments.\n\u0093This agreement does full justice to the needs of all parties in the cocoa economy,\u0094 said Carlos Fortin, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) which sponsored the talks in Geneva. \u0093It is realistic, taking on board developments in the world economy and in the commodities markets.\u0094\nAmong other things, the agreement encourages new and ongoing projects, some of them to be sponsored in part by the International Cocoa Organization. It paves the way for the creation of farmer cooperatives aimed at increasing farmers' income, and for research and development of new farming methods, fertilizers and nutrient additives.\nPrivate sector participation in projects related to the agreement, and in the overall management of cocoa resources at the international level, will take the form of a consultative board within the International Cocoa Organization. The board will facilitate information exchange, identify threats to supply and demand, and propose action. The private sector will also be encouraged to contribute to a newly-established Promotion Fund to finance promotional campaigns and sponsor research.\nThe agreement's entry into force requires ratification by a minimum of five exporting countries accounting for at least 80% of total exports, and by importing countries representing 60% of total imports. It will be open for signature at UN headquarters in New York, which acts as depositary, on 1 May of this year.\nContact: Abdelaziz Megzari, Head, Commodities Branch and Head, Division on International Trade in Goods and Services, and Commodities, UNCTAD, Palais des Nations, CH-1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland, telephone +41-22/907 5763, fax +41-22/907 0509, e-mail < abdelaziz-megzari@unctad.org >, website ( www.unctad.org ).\nADVISERS ON ICT REPORT\nHigh-level advisers to the UN Secretary-General on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), meeting in Davos (Switzerland) on 29 January 2001, adopted a report to assist formulating the Secretary-General's recommendations to the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on establishing an Information and Communication Technologies Task Force.\nICT, according to the advisers, \u0093can be a potent instrument for accelerating broad-based growth and sustainable development and for reducing poverty.\u0094 They said the huge potential of the IT revolution had not been adequately reflected in development policies. Though there are many initiatives and activities at all levels and regions of the world, the development impact of these could be significantly enhanced through strengthening synergies, ensuring complementarity, promoting awareness, and through supporting, replicating and scaling-up successful practices.\nAs envisioned by the experts, the Task Force aims to:\n-- forge strategic partnerships between the UN system, private industry, trusts and foundations, donor governments, programme countries, and other relevant international actors;\n-- develop innovative modalities for strengthening the ICT capacity of developing countries;\n-- pool the experience of both developed and developing countries in introducing and promoting ICT for\ndevelopment; and\n-- administer a trust fund supported by voluntary contributions.\nDeveloping nations\u0096particularly in Africa and the least developed countries\u0096should be the major focus of the effort, according to the advisers. Key roles identified for the Task Force included the following.\n-- Help develop balanced approaches that can address issues of promoting access, development of skills and local\ncontent, and the desire and capacity to use the ICT for development.\n-- Mobilize commitment by political leaders at the highest level.\n-- Create conducive and independent regulatory frameworks and institutions.\n-- Develop norms and guidelines based on available experience and knowledge.\n-- Create the broad conditions for affordable access.\n-- Develop local applications content and entrepreneurship.\n-- Develop instruments to integrate ICT into development cooperation policies and practices so that official\ndevelopment assistance can be leveraged in new and innovative ways.\n-- Carry out stakeholder campaigns to mobilize governments, the private sector, NGOs, academia, local\ncommunities and businesses to achieve these goals.\n-- Serve a catalytic role to set global priorities and add value to existing and new initiatives at the local, national,\nregional and global levels.\nThe advisers also recommended the Task Force formulate a Programme of Action with clear priorities, target dates and indicators to measure achievement. They said it should establish effective, transparent and participatory procedures, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, in the pursuit of its objectives.\nTo support the Task Force, the advisers suggested a decentralized network of regional, sub-regional and national mechanisms built on existing programmes and activities. These sub-Task Forces, which would serve as a source of \u0093global inventory\u0094 and would work to mobilize all actors at these levels to highlight and address locally- and globally-identified gaps and constraints in policy and strategy.\nRegarding composition of the Task Force, the advisers said it should be: comprised of high-level policy representatives of stakeholders; balanced in terms of partner and geographical representation; and inclusive and participatory but as small as possible without compromising its representative character. They said the President of ECOSOC should be an ex officio member.\nConcerning funding, it was recommended that initially a core budget from voluntary contributions be established under the UN Secretary-General's authority to support the Task Force's functioning and small secretariat. The Task Force would seek to mobilize funding in order to support programmes and projects. It could also consider mobilizing additional resources for a trust fund, as well as raising resources through other appropriate mechanisms.\nThe advisers proposed that the initial duration of the Task Force's mandate be three years, commencing with its first substantive meeting in September 2001.\nContact: Sarbuland Khan, Division for ECOSOC Support and Coordination, 1 UN Plaza, New York NY 10017, United States, telephone +1-212/963 4628, fax +1-212/963 1712, e-mail < khan2@un.org >, website ( www.un.org/esa/coordination/ecosoc/itforum ).\nUN-NGO COOPERATION\nWORLD BANK CIVIL SOCIETY FORUM\nA joint resolution between the World Bank and the NGO Working Group says that an Annual World Bank-Civil Society Forum will be established. The Forum is expected to provide a key opportunity for dialogue between the Bank and civil society on specific topics. It will convene, among others, representatives of NGOs, trade unions, community organizations, religious groups and women's organizations. During the December 2000 NGO World Bank Committee meeting it was decided that the Forum, which will replace the annual Committee meeting in Washington DC, will have its first meeting in late 2001.\nIn order to assist organization of the Annual Forum, a Joint Facilitation Committee will be created. During the first half of 2001, the NGO Working Group will advise the Bank on the role of the Committee, its functions, size, structure, and criteria for selection of its civil society members. The Committee is expected to be established no later than 30 June 2001, and its membership will include the Chair of the NGO Working Group as well as two other representatives of the Group.\nThe Annual Forum initiative came in response to the ever-expanding and evolving relationship of the Bank and civil society. Over the years, the dialogue has decentralized significantly and grown to include a myriad of discussions on an ad-hoc basis. It has also resulted in an expansion of policy dialogue and consultation with NGOs beyond the realm of the Committee. Consequently, numerous NGOs and members of civil society have questioned the centralized system of World Bank-NGO relations for global policy dialogue. They have also been eager to ensure the strengthening of local and national interaction, and to increase opportunities for civil society organizations from the South to participate in the policy issues dialogue.\nTaking into account the changing relationship between the Bank and civil society, in late 2000 the Working Group submitted a detailed proposal to the Bank outlining recommendations on its future role. They included bringing more actors into the World Bank-civil society dialogue; focusing the dialogue on specific issues; and updating both the mandate and structure of the Working Group.\nThe NGO World Bank Committee was created in the early 1980s. It is composed of representatives of the World Bank and NGOs, which form the NGO Working Group on the World Bank. The NGO Working Group is expected to continue its work on participation and capacity building with the World Bank, and facilitation of regional and country consultations.\nContact: William Reuben, Coordinator of NGOs and Civil Society, World Bank, 1818 H St. NW, Washington DC 20433, United States, telephone +1-202/458 5012, fax +1-202/522 1669, e-mail < wreuben@worldbank.org >, website ( www.worldbank.org ).\nUNESCO AND IFJ CAMPAIGN\nWomen Make the News 2001 was jointly launched in March by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ). The aim of the web-based operation was to encourage print, broadcast and electronic media worldwide to place news under the editorial responsibility of women journalists from 5-11 March to mark International Women's Day (8 March).\n\u0093[This] is designed to draw attention to the fact that, although the number of women in the media is increasing, they are all too few to rise to top positions,\u0094 according to organizers. \u0093By stressing this point, UNESCO is reaffirming the commitment made at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing (China) in 1995 to promote equal professional opportunity for women.\u0094\nWomen Make the News was first launched on International Women's Day in 2000 by UNESCO Director-General Ko\u00efchiro Matsuura. Many international organizations supported the initiative, and more than 1,000 media from 56 countries took part. This year, UNESCO invited IFJ to become a partner in the week-long operation. IFJ is the world's largest organization of journalists, with some 450,000 members in more than 100 countries. It promotes international action to defend press freedom and promote issues such as equal opportunities for men and women.\nUNESCO and IFJ said it is up to each media organization to determine how it participates in Women Make the News initiatives. For example, this year some appointed women editors-in-chief or named them head of newspaper sections, while others published special features on issues related to women and the media.\nContact: Press Service, UNESCO, 7 place de Fontenoy, F-75700 Paris, France, telephone +33-1/45 68 17 44, fax +33-1/45 68 56 52, website ( www.unesco.org/march8 ).\nIFJ, rue Royale 266, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium, telephone +32-2/223 2265, fax +32-2/219 2976, e-mail < ifj@ifj.org >, website < www.ifj.org >.\nNGO UPDATE\nINDIGENOUS PEOPLES CONFERENCE\nAround 120 participants including indigenous activists attended the International Conference on Conflict Resolution, Peace Building, Sustainable Development and Indigenous Peoples, held in Manila (Philippines) from 6-8 December 2000. The conference brought together former and current combatants, peace-builders, representatives of donor agencies, academia, and multilateral bodies including the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\nThe event was organized by the Tebtebba Foundation with support from Third World Network, International Development Research Centre (Canada), Evangelische Zentralstelle f\u00fcr Entwicklungshilfe (Germany), Inter-Church Organization for Development Cooperation (Netherlands), Danida (Denmark) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Comprised of eight panel discussions, workshops, papers and plenary discussions, the conference resulted in a declaration and country resolutions and recommendations for Africa, West Papua, Peru, Colombia, Aceh (Indonesia) and Midanao (Philippines).\nSpeakers on a panel about peace accords with states observed that many accords forged by indigenous peoples with governments had failed, resulting in disillusionment and disappointment. Some speakers blamed the failure on what they described as the insincerity of most governments to fully implement the accords.\nSpeakers on a panel concerning land rights and rights to resources said the root cause of conflicts in indigenous territories was the rights to, and utilization of, these resources. They noted that such conflicts could be traced back to colonization, whose impact is still felt today. Speakers said that conflict over land and resources was due to a basic contradiction between the Western perception of property rights regimes, and indigenous beliefs and practices concerning resource management. They said the principle of self-determination should be the guiding light in any effort to resolve conflict over indigenous peoples' land and resources.\nDuring a panel on self-determination, it was argued that this is both an end and means to peace- building in indigenous peoples' territories. Speakers proposed varied means through which this fundamental right might be expressed including secession in the case of the Mindanao in the Philippines, home-rule for the Inuit in Greenland, autonomy for the Archaucos in Colombia, and independence for the Aceh in Indonesia.\nA panel on liberation movements and post-conflict reconstruction addressed the links between movements for national liberation and those for indigenous peoples. Examples cited included the national democratic movement in the Philippines and the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. Speakers advised indigenous peoples to invoke their right to self-determination even within the framework of national liberation movements.\nDuring a panel on negotiating gender in conflict resolution and peace-building, indigenous women gave their views on conflict resolution and depicted women as active agents of peace processes.\nA panel on indigenous definitions of identities, conflicts, conflict resolution and sustainable development underscored traditional mechanisms for resolving conflict, and the ways in which meaning is given to those mechanisms in the context of culture and as expressed in language, ritual, folk beliefs and place.\nIn a panel on the role of civil society, donor agencies and multilateral organizations in conflict resolution and peace-building, speakers said in situations where the state becomes a party to conflict the role of civil society, the UN and other international bodies becomes crucial. They can help create conditions for the parties to sit down and negotiate. The function of such agencies, speakers said, was facilitation, moderation, conciliation, mediation and arbitration.\nA declaration entitled \u0093We Will Keep the Past Not Behind Us But in Front of Us!\u0094 includes the following commitments.\n-- Create an Independent International Commission of Indigenous Peoples for Mediation and Conflict Resolution\nno later than 2002. Its mission would be to promote and defend the rights of indigenous peoples, and expose\nand denounce aggression and abuses of the rights of indigenous peoples in different parts of the world.\n-- Create an Indigenous Peoples Global Network for Research, aimed at supporting and strengthening the\ncapacities of indigenous peoples to undertake research and documentation and disseminate information as widely\nas possible.\n-- Strengthen indigenous global, regional and local networks and collaboration in education, campaign, and policy\nadvocacy.\n-- Build partnerships with the media, academia, civil society organizations, NGOs and others to promote public\nunderstanding of the issues facing indigenous peoples, as well as peace building and solidarity.\nContact: Tebtebba Foundation, No. 1 Roman Ayson Road, 2600 Baguio City, Philippines, telephone +64-73/444 7703, fax +63-2/932 7625, e-mail < tebtebba@skyinet.net >, website ( www.tebtebba.org ).\nCAMPAIGN AGAINST \u0093CONFLICT DIAMONDS\u0094\nFrustrated by delays in international action to ban \u0093conflict diamonds,\u0094 over 70 United States-based human rights, humanitarian and development NGOs launched a campaign on 14 February 2001 calling on the US Congress to enact legislation that will subject imported diamonds to tight controls.\nThe campaign, led by Physicians for Human Rights, World Vision, Oxfam America and Amnesty International USA, is promoting the \u0093Clean Diamonds Act\u0094 to give exporting countries a year to comply with the Kimberly Standards (or \u0093rough standards\u0094), a certification system endorsed by the UN General Assembly in December 2000 (see Go Between 84 ). This aims to make it difficult for diamonds mined for the benefit of rebel insurgencies in Africa\u0096most notably in Sierra Leone, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo\u0096to enter the US. According to the campaign such an initiative by the US, which imports 65% of the world's diamond jewelry, could help push the international process forward and encourage prompt adoption of the Kimberly Standards by all countries.\nThe campaign was launched on St. Valentine's Day, when people in the US give gifts to loved ones. Since some purchase expensive gifts such as diamonds, the NGOs called on the jewelry and diamond industry in the country to support the Clean Diamonds Act. The legislation is sponsored by Congressional representatives Tony Hall and Cynthia McKinney, both Democrats, and Republican Frank Wolf.\nA letter from the campaign to the group Jewelers of America and the World Diamond Congress (WDC) said that \u0093until a major importer of diamonds such as the US prohibits the direct or indirect importation of any and all diamonds and diamond jewelry from any country that does not have controls in place, progress in establishing the international system will proceed at a leisurely pace.\u0094 The letter urges the WDC to \u0093protect your own product and safeguard unwitting American consumers by supporting tight restrictions against all diamonds that emerge from countries that have not adopted the Kimberly rough controls.\u0094\nThe worldwide diamond industry, concerned about the the role of diamonds in helping to fuel prolonged conflict in Africa, is also worried about the growing association of diamonds with brutality and bloodshed.\n\u0093The industry is committed to stamping out conflict diamonds,\u0094 said WDC Executive Director Matthew Runci, \u0093and we will work with all interested parties to accomplish this goal.\u0094\nHowever, according to Physicians for Human Rights representative Holly Burkhalter, NGO efforts to work with the WDC have broken down over NGO insistence that all diamond imports, including finished jewelry, be subject to the certification process. She said the industry wanted only loose diamonds covered. NGOs says the WDC's proposed \u0093Conflict Diamonds Act\u0094 to the US Congress contains loopholes and has a more flexible definition of \u0093cooperation\u0094 by exporting countries. This includes allowing the US Treasury Department to determine that a government is cooperating with the certification procedure as long as it is \u0093making progress\u0094 in complying with it.\nThe Clean Diamonds Act would set up an independent commission to monitor compliance and would provide tough penalties for violators, including sentences of up to ten years in prison. Organizers of the NGO campaign said they do not support a total embargo of diamonds or a boycott because they are essential to the economies of \u0093some governments of goodwill\u0094 including South Africa, Botswana and Namibia.\nContact: Holly Burkhalter, Physicians for Human Rights, 1156 15th Street, NW, Suite 1001, Washington DC 20005, United States, telephone +1-202/728 5335, fax +1-202/728 3053, e-mail < hollyb@phrusa.org >, website ( www.phrusa.org ).\nCUT THE COST CAMPAIGN\nOxfam International launched a Cut the Cost campaign in February 2001 to raise awareness about high prices charged by drug companies in the world's poorest countries.\nOxfam estimates that 11 million people in developing countries die each year from preventable illnesses, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa has made the issue even more urgent. Seventy percent of the world's 36.1 million people infected with HIV live in Africa. Less than 1% of them have access to AIDS drugs that cost from US$10,000 to US$15,000 a year. These have revolutionized AIDS treatment in the West by cutting mortality by half.\nPharmaceutical companies argue that bringing new medicines to the market can cost up to US$1 billion. However, organizers of the Cut the Cost campaign said 90% of new medicines are designed for only 10% of the world's population, mainly in rich countries. Much of the cost for AIDS research comes from taxpayer-funded studies, they noted, with the drug industry spending twice as much on marketing, advertising and promotion as it does on research and development.\nNGOs, led by Oxfam and M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), mobilized to stop a major lawsuit that went to trial in Pretoria (South Africa) on 5 March 2001. The case, which was brought by 42 pharmaceutical companies against the South African government, is challenging a 1997 law in the country aimed at making medicine more affordable to patients.\n\u0093This court case symbolizes the hypocrisy of the pharmaceutical industry,\u0094 said Oxfam policy director Justin Forsyth. \u0093They talk about wanting to improve people's access to medicines\u0096but only on their terms. When the South African government tried to implement legislation to make this happen, the industry immediately stepped in to block it. This is a chilling message from the drug companies to other developing country governments: Play by our rules, or face the consequences.\u0094\nThe companies claim that the South African Medicines and Related Substances Control Act is unconstitutional. They are challenging section 15(c) in particular, which gives the South African health minister power to override pharmaceutical patents when public health is at stake. The companies argue this violates their intellectual property rights, which they claim are protected by the World Trade Organization's Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) Agreement, signed by South Africa.\nThe companies also object to the requirement within the Act that South African pharmacists must dispense cheaper generic medicines rather than patent versions when possible; they say this unfairly discriminates against their products.\nThe government's defense is that it must meet the challenge of providing affordable medicines in South Africa. In a 1999 survey in the country, 66% of respondents cited cost as the main reason for not seeking health care when they are sick. The government says this public health need justifies the enactment of policies and laws that enable it to provide access to cheaper medicines. Public health safeguards are built into the TRIPs agreement, it says, so the court should uphold what it believes to be legitimate implementation of these safeguards.\nOxfam and MSF denounced the \u0093callousness and bullying\u0094 of the pharmaceutical giants and accused the companies of defending their patents without considering the value of human life.\n\u0093We are not against patents, but it is absurd to apply the same rules and duration of patent protection in poor countries as in rich ones,\u0094 said Kevin Watkins, Oxfam senior policy adviser. \u0093Governments have a clear obligation to put the health of their citizens before the profit margins of patent holders.\u0094\nAn international day of action on the first day of the trial was called by the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), a South African NGO working on access to medicines for people with HIV/AIDS. More than 2,000 protestors marched to the High Court in Pretoria and to the United States embassy to present a memorandum explaining their opposition to the court case. Similar demonstrations were held in most major cities of the country. In 12 other countries and many more capital cities activists held protests and organized petitions to oppose the case.\nThe trial was postponed to enable the pharmaceutical companies to respond to unexpected testimony offered by TAC. It planned to provide evidence that drug companies abuse their patents through tiered pricing tactics, and to graphically exhibit the misery caused by HIV/AIDS in the developing world.\n\u0093For the first time,\u0094 said TAC Chairman Zackie Achmat, \u0093the pharmaceutical industry will have to justify to South Africa and the world why their drug prices are so high, and why their patents should be so aggressively protected when millions of people are dying and cheaper drugs exist.\u0094\nAccording to TAC around 400,000 people have died from HIV/AIDS since the pharmaceutical industry launched its fight against the legislation in 1997. \u0093This is a case for poor people across the globe,\u0094 said Mr. Achmat. \u0093It's about whether governments have the right to legislate against profit and for health care.\u0094\nUS-based groups supporting the NGO campaign and the South African government include the Africa Fund, American Committee on Africa, and the Africa Policy Information Center. They issued a statement on 5 March that said the AIDS crisis \u0093is solvable if there is enough political will. The question is how much inequality we are prepared to accept in the world and whether we believe that Africa is part of our common humanity.\u0094\nContact: Oxfam International Secretariat, 266 Banbury Road, Oxford OX2 7DL, United Kingdom, telephone +44-1865/31 39 39, fax +44-1865/31 39 35, e-mail < information@oxfaminternational.org >, website ( www.oxfam.org ).\nAMNESTY REPORT ON TORTURE TRADE\nTorturers are arming themselves with increasingly sophisticated equipment, according a report by Amnesty International, and trade in these devices is growing. The equipment includes high-voltage electric shock stun weapons and chemical crowd control devices, while torturers continue to abuse old-style equipment such as restraint devices.\nStopping the Torture Trade reveals that the international trade in high-voltage electroshock batons, shields, stun guns and stun belts has been expanding throughout the 1990s. This includes \u0093tasers,\u0094 which can shoot fishhook-like darts on wires into victims up to 30 feet away, and stun belts that are strapped to prisoners and operated by remote control devices. The belts have been known to set off accidentally, thrusting about 50,000 volts through prisoners' kidneys for up to eight seconds. This technology began in the United States and has spread to Asia, Europe and South America, according to the report.\n\u0093In the 1970s there were only two companies known to market high voltage electroshock stun weapons, and now there are over 150 worldwide,\u0094 said Brian Wood, a researcher with Amnesty International. \u0093In the absence of stringent controls to prevent this equipment ending up in the hands of torturers, responsible governments must ban its export immediately.\u0094\nIn the last two years, over 150 companies operating in 22 countries have been making or marketing electroshock weapons. Now \u0093Taiwanese, South Korean and Chinese companies probably manufacture more electroshock weapons than companies in the United States,\u0094 according to Amnesty. \u0093German, French and Israeli companies are also among the key manufacturers and recently Polish, Russian, Czech, Mexican, Brazilian and South African firms have joined in.\u0094\nThe report, one of a series to be released in a year-long campaign to stop torture, also highlights the trade by over 40 companies in more conventional security devices that can be used for serious abuse of human rights, such as mechanical restraints and chemical sprays. It notes that military, security and police expertise taught internationally has also been used for torture. Hundreds of graduates of the US School of the Americas \u0093have been implicated in human rights violations in South America,\u0094 according to Amnesty.\nThe report calls on governments to:\n-- ban the use of police and security equipment whose use is inherently cruel, inhumane or degrading, and ban the\nmanufacture and promotion of this equipment and its trade to other countries;\n-- suspend the international transfer of, among other things, leg cuffs, thumbcuffs, shackle boards, restraint chairs\nand pepper gas weapons pending the outcome of a rigorous and independent review into the effects of these\ndevices;\n-- suspend the use of high voltage electroshock weapons pending the outcome of the review; and\n-- ensure that the training of military, security and police personnel of another country does not include the transfer\nof skills, knowledge and techniques likely to lend themselves to torture.\nContact: Amnesty International, 99-119 Rosebery Avenue, London EC1R 4RE, United Kingdom, telephone +44-20/7814 6200, fax +44-20/7833 1510, e-mail < info@amnesty.org.uk >, website ( www.amnesty.org ).\nCALL ON US TO END HUNGER\nFor a penny a day per American, the United States could lead an international campaign to cut world hunger in half by the year 2015. This is the conclusion of a report on Foreign Aid to End Hunger, published by US-based Bread for the World Institute.\nThe report recommends the nation's Congress and President Bush start with US$1 billion a year in additional aid and debt relief for sub-Saharan Africa, where hunger is most widespread and intractable. This commitment would prompt other industrial nations to provide more aid.\n\u0093Hunger has dropped dramatically in developing countries during the last 30 years, but tragically it has doubled in sub-Saharan Africa,\u0094 said Bread for the World President David Beckmann. \u0093If we want to cut world hunger in half by 2015, we have to start where hunger hits hardest.\u0094\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, 291 million people live on less than US$1 a day, and one person in three is chronically undernourished. The region's problems have been exacerbated by civil wars, HIV/AIDS, declining agriculture, huge foreign debts, inadequate education and health care, and a lack of roads and other infrastructure. To overcome hunger and poverty, the report says, African countries need to improve agriculture and food distribution, build infrastructure, enroll more children in school, empower and educate women, prevent and treat HIV/AIDS and other diseases, and start new businesses and micro-enterprises. Bread for the World Institute is calling for \u0093a long-term US aid partnership to help African countries make these investments.\u0094\nReducing African nations' foreign debt payments is essential, the report notes, to free additional money for education, health care and other investments. The industrial nations \u0093have agreed to write off US$90 billion of poor country debt,\u0094 it said. But Congress must approve the US contribution each year. Foreign Aid to End Hunger includes a new poll showing that 83% of Americans favour a US commitment to help cut world hunger in half by 2015. The nationwide poll by the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy Attitudes found that Americans overwhelmingly favour, and are willing to pay for, US aid to help the world's poorest countries\u0096especially in Africa. Moreover, Americans support this aid despite their misgivings (and misconceptions) about foreign aid in general, it said.\nWell-planned, poverty-focused US foreign aid can make a big difference for hungry and poor people, the report argues. The Marshall Plan and other US programmes helped Europe and Japan rebuild after World War II. The Green Revolution doubled crop yields and cut hunger by more than half in Asia. And the United Nation's Children Fund (UNICEF) Child Survival Initiative, partly supported by US aid, saves the lives of four million children each year through low-cost immunizations and oral rehydration therapy.\n\u0093Hunger is one problem we can actually solve,\u0094 Mr. Beckmann said. \u0093For the first time in history, we have the resources and technology to do it. The cost is surprisingly low. But our government must make it a priority. Other industrial countries have made it clear that if we take the lead, they will join us. They are waiting to see if we will accept that challenge.\u0094\nContact: Bread for the World, 50 F Street NW, Suite 500, Washington DC 20001, United States, telephone +1-202/639 9400, fax +1-202/639 9401, e-mail < bread@bread.org >, website ( www.bread.org ).\nWORLD CONSUMER RIGHTS DAY\nOn the 19th annual commemoration of World Consumer Rights Day on 15 March 2001, Consumers International (CI) said it is focusing on ways of \u0093enhancing positive contributions that can be made by transnational corporations while eliminating the negative ones.\u0094\nCI's global federation of 260 organizations in over 110 countries are planning activities this year around the theme including new and constructive approaches to advancing consumer rights and social justice through greater corporate accountability.\nKey targets for action by consumer groups include:\n-- control of tobacco promotion;\n-- implementing a ban on the \u0093dirty dozen\u0094 of dangerous pesticides; and\n-- labeling of genetically-modified foods.\nConsumers International said that groups \u0093around the world are campaigning to ensure that governments do not give in to pressure from corporations in these different areas. Instead they should strengthen global rules that protect consumer rights in a global marketplace.\u0094\nContact: CI, 24 Highbury Crescent, London N5 1RX, United Kingdom, telephone +44-171/226 6663, fax +44-171/354 0607, e-mail < consint@consint.org >, website ( www.consumersinternational.org ).\nOTHER NEWS\nTHIRD GLOBAL FORUM\nThe Third Global Forum, held in Naples (Italy) from 15-17 March 2001, brought together representatives of 122 countries including ministers, as well as representatives of multilateral agencies, the business community and NGOs. The Forum, hosted by the government of Italy, debated and explored the potential of information and communication technology (ICT) in both developed and developing countries.\nMore than 900 international experts and practitioners contributed to wide-ranging debates about key challenges facing governments in the design and implementation of \u0093e-government strategies\u0094 to meet the expectations and demands of their citizens for more accessible, transparent and accountable government.\nThemes discussed included:\n-- governance issues in the online era;\n-- the impact of ICT on the organization of government;\n-- implementing \u0093e-government\u0094 services to citizens and businesses; and\n-- the digital divide and international cooperation.\nParticipants recognized the power of ICT to transform the way in which governments work, especially in the delivery of services and access to information. They said this can consistently improve the quality of life for citizens and create a sharp reduction in costs.\nIn other areas, such as strengthening decision making and policy formation, participants said information and communication technology had the potential to integrate data and facts in a more structured and comprehensive form through better knowledge management.\nMoreover, it was recognized that the quality of data itself will improve through better collection and analysis. ICT could facilitate information-sharing and the involvement of experts, as well as broadening the basis on which governments seek to identify and reconcile conflicting interests and goals.\nA major benefit of ICT also lies in its capacity to involve citizens and civil society in the policy debate through direct interaction.\nBut for these benefits to be realized, participants said, the developing world needs access to technology, lower costs of access and the training to use it effectively. Otherwise the digital divide would lead to an ever-widening gap. The need to reorient policies for international cooperation and development was also recognized by many. Actions to ensure that the primary needs of survival are met remain paramount, but basic education and ICT development \u0093appear to have become the second and third top priority.\u0094 The latter is reasonably inexpensive to implement, does not consume large quantities of energy and respects the environment.\nAlthough there was generally consensus that ICT in government could have widespread and beneficial results, many insisted that risks to privacy and security must be addressed. The new technology should be used for the benefit of citizens and not against them, they warned. Public servants should not only be trained to use ICT effectively, but they must do so in a culture that respects the rights of citizens within a framework of good governance.\nContact: Website ( www.globalforum.it ).\nSWC PREPARATORY MEETINGS\nFrom 17-20 December 2001 in Yokohama (Japan) governments, NGOs, private sector representatives and young people will gather at the Second World Congress (SWC) Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. The SWC will review governments' progress in implementing the Agenda for Action adopted at the 1996 First World Congress held in Stockholm (Sweden), and it will discuss national progress reports in plenary sessions.\nThe SWC is organized by the government of Japan, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the international NGO ECPAT (End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes), and the Geneva-based NGO Group for the Convention of the Rights of the Child, which together form the International Planning Committee.\nThe Planning Committee, which met in Tokyo (Japan) in February 2001, decided on, among other things, a tentative framework for the work programme of the SWC including three panel discussions that will focus on lessons learned, obstacles and challenges, and ways forward.\nThe Planning Committee meeting was preceded by a symposium, organized by the government of Japan, to take stock of progress of governments in implementing the Stockholm Agenda for Action. Some participants noted that progress has been slow. For example, of the 22 Latin American nations that signed the Agenda for Action, only four\u0096Chile, Dominican Republic, Mexico and Brazil\u0096have developed a national plan to fight sexual exploitation of children.\n\u0093On a scale of one to ten,\u0094 said Bruce Harris, Executive Director of the NGO Casa Alianza, \u0093with ten being the most aggressive response to the problem, we are about two or two-and-a-half. But those are better numbers than zero.\u0094\nAt the regional level, SWC preparatory meetings are planned or are being integrated into the regional preparatory process for the United Nations Special Session on Children, to be held from 19-21 September 2001 in New York. SWC regional preparatory meetings have been held in Senegal, Costa Rica and India. In June 2001 a regional preparatory meeting for Southern Africa will be held in Zimbabwe, and a preparatory meeting for Eastern Africa is tentatively scheduled for the third quarter of 2001.\nContact: H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Sackstein, Coordinator of the Focal Point on Sexual Exploitation of Children, NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the Child, care of Defence for Children International, PO Box 88, CH-1211 Geneva 20, Switzerland, telephone +41-22/740 4711, fax +41-22/740 1145, e-mail < info@focalpointngo.org >, website ( www.focalpointngo.org ).

Cutting world poverty in half by 2015 is the theme of this year's Development Co-operation 2000 Report, published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\nThe report reviews recent progress toward the goal of a world free of poverty and the misery it brings. It stresses the importance of partnerships to achieve this goal-between countries; among governments, civil society and the private sector; and among international organizations. The report says the challenge for the international community is to formulate concerted and coherent policies to ensure that globalization benefits poor people.\nConcerning trends in development finance, the report notes that while bank and bond financing to developing countries remains depressed following the Asian financial crisis, foreign direct investment (FDI) has proved resilient and is now the largest source of finance to developing countries. However, FDI remains concentrated on more dynamic economies. While some poor countries are attracting FDI, especially in oil and mining industries, \u0093most continue to see little of it.\u0094\nAid flows continued their modest recovery in 1999 with extra help for Asian countries, especially from Japan, and the international efforts to aid Kosovo and East Timor.\nThe report highlights two strategic policy areas where it says there is a strong potential to reduce poverty: investment in health, and attention to gender equality and mainstreaming. It calls for:\n-- \u0093stronger voices and choices for the poor;\u0094\n-- ensuring economic stability and growth that favours them;\n-- providing basic social services for all, including basic education and health care;\n-- opening markets to trade and technology; and\n-- maintaining adequate and well-directed development resources.\nContact: Media Relations, OECD, 2 rue Andr\u00e9-Pascal, F-75775 Paris C\u00e9dex 16, France, telephone +33-1/45 24 80 91, fax +33-1/45 24 80 03, e-mail < news.contact@oecd.org >, website ( www.oecd.org ).\nFOCUS\nPREPARATIONS FOR GA SPECIAL SESSION ON HIV/AIDS\nUN Member States, observers and civil society participants gathered in New York from 26 February to 2 March 2001 for informal consultations in preparation for the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS, to be held in New York from 25-27 June 2001.\nPeter Piot, Executive Director of the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), said he anticipated that the Special Session would be a turning point in the global response to the disease. Addressing the critical areas presented in the Secretary-General's report (see facing focus page), he underlined the importance of personal leadership and commitment from the top, and from leaders at every level, as critical in turning back the epidemic.\nDuring the two-day general debate on the Secretary-General's report, HIV/AIDS was recognized as a development crisis that needed a multi-sectoral response. Several delegates expressed their willingness for open and constructive negotiations, and said they expected the Special Session to adopt a focused final outcome document containing concrete actions.\nThe group of developing countries and China (G-77/China) said they saw the Special Session as a channel to fulfil the commitments agreed upon at the September 2000 Millennium Summit (see NGLS Roundup no. 62 ) of halting and reversing the epidemic's spread. The G-77/China stressed that underdevelopment is the main factor contributing to the spread of HIV/AIDS, and resources including financial and trade policy provisions are critically important.\nThe European Union (EU) emphasized that HIV/AIDS is a collective experience and should include the contribution and participation of civil society actors, both in the preparatory process and the Special Session. The United States said its strong commitment to tackling HIV/AIDS would continue under the Bush administration. In the US statement Secretary of State Colin Powell is cited as saying that \u0093AIDS is a national security problem. It is an economic problem. It is a devastating problem, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.\u0094 The statement reaffirmed US policy that health issues will be taken into consideration when addressing trade concerns.\nBrazil stressed the central role of human rights in addressing the issue and outlined ongoing South-South cooperation and the country's comprehensive national AIDS programmes, which include free access to antiretroviral treatment. Brazil also underlined the need to examine the trade-related aspects of the intellectual property rights (TRIPs) agreement to enable countries to protect the health of their populations, as well as the importance of developing a vaccine.\nSouth Africa emphasized the importance of prevention, which remains the mainstay of the country's national AIDS strategy. It also referred to the issue of antiretroviral drugs and the legislative course that the country has pursued to secure access to a range of essential medicines. South Africa recognized that there is more to the provision of HIV/AIDS care than just antiretroviral treatment, but that at a certain point access to antiretroviral medication \u0093becomes an issue of life and death.\u0094\nOne day was reserved for dialogue sessions between civil society and Member States in the form of two interactive panels comprised of representatives of civil society. Member States, UN agencies and civil society actors also participated actively in the discussions. Panelists in the first discussion on The Role of Civil Society as Partners in the HIV/AIDS Response cited successful examples of partnership between civil society and governments. These included in Latin America where partnerships between governments and NGOs, as well as groups of people living with HIV/AIDS, have moved from confrontation to collaboration. In these civil society was now able to participate in the development of national strategic plans, they said.\nDiscussants in the second panel on The General Assembly Special Session as an Opportunity for an Expanded Response also cited successful examples of innovative cooperation with governments, and they emphasized the need for follow-up to the Special Session. Participants in the audience stressed the crucial role of additional resources in combating the disease, as well as the need to specify funding priorities. A representative of India proposed a global Drug Facility to fund the provision of drugs to the most affected countries. Many participants also commended the panels for providing the opportunity for positive dialogue between civil society and Member States.\nMember States held informal consultations concerning a discussion paper prepared by UNAIDS on Reversing the HIV/AIDS Epidemic: Critical Issues. It was designed to stimulate discussions on critical issues to be included in the anticipated outcome of the Special Session. The paper, which attempts to operationalize the challenges that HIV/AIDS poses to the global community, discusses leadership and coordination; alleviating the social and economical impact; reducing vulnerability; prevention; care and support; research and development; and resources. Issues stressed during the informal consultations included leadership, prevention and the important role of resources.\nThe second round of informal consultations between Member States will be held from 21-25 May 2001 in New York. UNAIDS supports several mechanisms through which civil society actors can contribute their perspectives on HIV/AIDS issues as inputs to the Special Session. Organizations can exchange views and network through a Break-the-Silence electronic forum, which can be joined by sending an e-mail to < join-break-the-silence@hdnet.org >.\nContact: Dominique De Santis, Press Officer, UNAIDS, 20 avenue Appia, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland, telephone +41-22/791 4509, fax +41-22/791 4898, e-mail < desantisd@unaids.org >, website ( www.unaids.org ).

Go Between summarizes its conclusions and recommendations.\nThe report was issued in preparation for the General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS, which will take place in New York from 25-27 June 2001. Alarmed by the accelerating epidemic and its global impact, the General Assembly decided in November 2000 to hold the Special Session at the highest political level (see Go Between 83 ).\nThe report urges intensified and broadened political and financial commitments by nations in their response to the AIDS crisis. It calls on governments worldwide to meet a set of seven critical challenges that will help reverse the AIDS epidemic. These are:\n-- effective leadership and coordination;\n-- alleviating the social and economic impact of the epidemic;\n-- reducing the vulnerability of particular social groups to HIV infection;\n-- achieving agreed targets for the prevention of HIV infection;\n-- ensuring that care and support is available to people infected and affected by HIV/AIDS;\n-- developing relevant and effective international public goods; and\n-- mobilizing the necessary level of financial resources.\n\u0093Leadership is fundamental to an effective response,\u0094 said Mr. Annan. \u0093One of the key issues facing the global community is developing and sustaining such dedicated leadership, vital if the nature of the epidemic is to be clearly understood throughout society and a national response mobilized.\u0094\nAnother core challenge is to alleviate the epidemic's social and economic impacts. In many countries, AIDS has significantly undermined key sectors. Its negative impact is evident in economic development, education, health and agriculture. In addition conflict, war, economic uncertainty, gender inequality and social exclusion have all made people more vulnerable to HIV infection, according to the report.\nIt also says that an expanded prevention effort is vital to containing the spread of the epidemic, and spending on prevention will help avert the future cost and impact of infection. A particularly effective intervention is the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. A short course of antiretroviral treatment can cut the rate of transmission to children by 20%-50%.\nAs well as the need to strengthen health care systems, the affordability of medicines for opportunistic infections and antiretroviral therapy\u0096one of the greatest barriers to improving access to care\u0096must be dealt with. Some progress in reducing the price of medicines has resulted from the dialogue between the UN system and several research and development-based pharmaceutical companies, initiated in May 2000, as well as through the increasing availability of generic versions of antiretroviral drugs. Despite these efforts, much more needs to be done if access to care and treatment is to come within reach of the majority of people living with HIV and AIDS. Continuing inequalities in access to effective care and treatment must be specifically addressed through all possible means including tiered pricing, competition between suppliers, regional procurement, licensing agreements and the effective use of health safeguards in trade agreements. Mr. Annan also calls for focused international research and development to produce microbicides and vaccines for HIV/AIDS, and for greatly increased resources to meet the challenges of the disease.\nDespite the dramatic and ongoing spread of HIV/AIDS, the report says much has been learned in the last two decades, and the potential to reverse it has never been higher. Mr. Annan said that \u0093collective experience with HIV/AIDS has evolved to the point where it is now possible to state with confidence that it is technically, politically and financially feasible to contain HIV/AIDS and dramatically reduce its spread and impact.\u0094\nBy the end of 2000, 36.1 million men, women and children around the world were living with HIV or AIDS, and 21.8 million had died from the disease. The same year saw an estimated 5.3 million new infections globally and three million deaths, the highest annual total of AIDS deaths ever. An even greater epidemic can be prevented, according to the report. Large-scale prevention programmes \u0093in virtually all settings have clearly demonstrated that the spread of HIV can be reduced, especially among young people and hard-to-reach populations.\u0094\nThe report notes that successful responses have their roots in communities; empowering young people and women is essential; and people living with HIV or AIDS are central to the response. An approach based on human rights is fundamental\u0096combating stigma is a human rights imperative on its own, as well as of instrumental value in fighting denial and shame, both of which are major obstacles in opening dialogue about HIV/AIDS.\nA key lesson learned from the epidemic is that it is complex and must be tackled on several fronts\u0096by dealing with its risks, the factors that affect vulnerability to it, and the epidemic's impact. And single, isolated activities do not yield sustained results. Interventions to reduce HIV risk and change behaviour are effective only when a range of government ministries and partners in the social, economic and health fields are involved.\nContact: Dominique De Santis, Press Officer, UNAIDS, 20 avenue Appia, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland, telephone +41-22/791 4509, fax +41-22/791 4898, e-mail < desantisd@unaids.org >, website ( www.unaids.org ).\nCOMMISSION FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 39TH SESSION\nThe United Nations Commission for Social Development held its 39th session in New York from 13-23 February 2001, during which it discussed the themes Enhancing Social Protection and Reducing Vulnerability in a Globalizing World, and The Role of Volunteerism in the Promotion of Social Development.\nThe Commission elected Faith Innerarity (Jamaica) as its Chairperson and Vice-Chairpersons Henrik Hahn (Denmark), Nicole Elisha (Benin) and Muhammed Enayet Mowla (Bangladesh). In her opening speech Ms. Innerarity stressed that even though social protection was as old as society, it was becoming increasingly urgent. She said that in a world where economies are more and more market-driven, it was necessary to ensure that protections are in place to safeguard the vulnerable. She also highlighted the importance of the role of volunteerism in promoting social development, and the need to recognize the role of volunteers and civil society in social protection\u0096especially in light of the current International Year of Volunteers.\nEnhancing Social Protection and Reducing Vulnerability in a Globalizing World\nTo aid discussions of the selected themes, the Commission had before it a report by the Secretary-General on Enhancing Social Protection and Reducing Vulnerability in a Globalizing World (E/CN.5/2001/2) and a note (E/CN.5/2001/5) on the role of volunteerism in the promotion of social development. The Commission also organized two expert panel discussions on the themes.\nThe first expert panel on Enhancing Social Protection and Reducing Vulnerability in a Globalizing World discussed the social protection needs and priorities of societies. The panel included Dalmer Hoskins, Secretary-General of the International Social Security Association; Ernesto Murro Oberlin, Board Member of the National Social Security Bank of Uruguay; Vivienne Taylor, Chair of the Committee of Enquiry into a Comprehensive Security System, and Special Adviser to the Minister for Social Development of South Africa; and Frank Vandenbroucke, Minister for Social Affairs and Pensions of Belgium.\nPanellists said the main obstacles to social security includes demographic ageing, the issue of the proper roles of private and public sectors, the question of appropriateness of social security in developing countries, and the vulnerability of social security systems to political influence and potential bankruptcy.\nHowever, regions face different challenges that require different responses, they said. In Latin America the priority issue is not demographic ageing since most countries there have very young populations. One of the key concerns in the region is insufficient economic growth, with increasing unemployment and poverty and an expanding informal economy.\nAccording to panellists, the main challenges faced by welfare states in the developed countries include increases in the percentage of elderly, gender balance, and the growing participation of women in the workforce. In addition, the persistence of high and long-term unemployment and low participation in the work force, especially among women and older workers, and the falling provision of care and support from within the family pose growing challenges to social protection.\nRegarding social security systems, panellists emphasized the importance of long-term reform options and their sustainability. The provision of social security reflects an ideological stance, they said, which defines whose needs should be served. Therefore it is important that social security reforms reflect socio-economic circumstances and recognize relevant forces and factors. The case of South Africa was used as an illustration by one speaker, who said the exclusion of blacks and their unemployment were historic facts that needed to be considered in any reforms of the country's social security system. Also, the HIV/AIDS pandemic needed to be taken into account in South Africa when considering policy options since 10% of the country's population is estimated to be infected with the virus.\nGovernments Have Primary Responsibility for Social Protection\nMember States stressed that national governments have primary responsibility for social protection. They also emphasized the role of international cooperation in enabling developing countries to overcome their social welfare challenges, such as in enhancing financial and technical assistance and sharing best practices. The group of developing countries and China (G-77/China) pointed out that globalization can still generate growth and development and has potential to improve the overall performance of developing countries in the social sphere, open up export market opportunities, and increase financial resources for investment. However, the G-77/China said maximizing benefits and minimizing risks of globalization required the international community to address imbalances and asymmetries in the international global economy.\nThe European Union (EU) said no region is spared from problems associated with poverty and unemployment, social exclusion and indebtedness, which were realities within the EU as well. It argued that in many parts of the world, large numbers of the population remain outside formal social protection systems. Even though the responsibility for social protection rests with governments, it said the role of non-governmental organizations, the private sector, employers, trade unions and family members must be recognized in providing social support.\nAccording to the Rio Group of Latin American countries, a global approach to social protection would help define the functions of governments, the private sector, civil society and the family, and could encourage more effective use of resources.\nMember States were unable to reach consensus during subsequent negotiations for a resolution on Enhancing Social Protection and Reducing Vulnerability in a Globalizing World. Views were divided on, among other things, the definition of social protection, partnerships, mobilization of resources, and international cooperation for social protection.\nThe Role of Volunteerism in the Promotion of Social Development\nSharon Capeling-Alakija, Executive Director of the United Nations Volunteer Programme, said the sub-theme of the Role of Volunteerism in the Promotion of Social Development was the first time that volunteerism was discussed at such a high-level forum. She said the observance of the International Year of Volunteers was intended not only to celebrate volunteering but mark changes in this field.\nDuring the panel discussion on volunteerism, speakers recognized that it can be found in some form in all countries in the public sector and increasingly in the private sector. The panel included Justin Davies Smith, Founding Director of the Institute for Volunteering Research; Miguel Darcy Oliveira, Coordinator of the Institute for Cultural Action; Dasho Meghraj Gurung, Managing Director of the Bhutan Post, and Vice-Chairperson of the National International Year of Volunteers Committee of Bhutan; Michael Bursch, Member of the German Federal Parliament and Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission on the Future and Social Civic Participation; and Joan Denise Daries, Director of the Volunteer Centre of Cape Town, and Chairperson of both the National International Year of Volunteers Committee of South Africa and the South African National Aid Council Task Force.\nPanellists emphasized that volunteerism should not be used as a justification for reducing state responsibilities in the area of social protection. Instead, it should be seen as complementing state action in an appropriate and sensible way. Voluntary actions are often considered by many people as providing a basic safety net. Government action can either stimulate and encourage voluntary action, or discourage it. An important question, according to the panellists, is how governments can support volunteerism by creating a space for it without stifling the autonomy of volunteers.\nNew Multi-Year Programme of Work and the Situation of Families\nDuring its session the Commission also reviewed relevant United Nations plans and programmes of action pertaining to the situation of social groups. It focused on those related to ageing, the family and disabled persons. Discussions were dominated by the issue of the situation of the family. Several speakers highlighted the essential role of families in providing social safety nets, as well as care of children and the elderly. Governments were urged to protect and assist families, so they could fully assume their social responsibilities within their communities.\nThe Commission also discussed its multi-year programme of work for 2002-2006. Themes suggested for the next five-year period were among the principle themes discussed during the June 2000 Five-Year Review of the World Summit for Social Development in Geneva, as well as the 1995 World Summit for Social Development.\nThe Commission agreed on the following priority themes.\n-- 2002\u0096Integration of Social and Economic Policy. Under the theme, topics to be considered are: social aspects of\nmacro-economic policies, social assessment as a policy tool, and expenditures in the social sector as a\nproductive factor.\n-- 2003\u0096National and International Cooperation for Social Development. Under the theme, topics to be considered\nare: sharing of experiences and best practices in social development, forging partnerships for social development,\nsocial responsibility of the private sector, impact of employment strategies on social development, and the role of\ninternational financial institutions' policies and their effect on social development strategies.\n-- 2004\u0096Improving Public Sector Effectiveness.\n-- 2005\u0096Review of Further Implementation of the Social Summit and the Outcome of the 24th Special Session of\nthe General Assembly.\n-- 2006\u0096Review of the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006).\nNeed for Further Sharing of Views\nThe Commission adopted a decision that recognized the need for further analyses, research and sharing of views on social protection. It also decided to consider ways of examining the theme further at a future session.\nThe Commission adopted a resolution on Volunteering and Social Development, in which it encourages states to increase public awareness of the vital contribution of volunteerism to communities and support voluntary action. This includes taking measures concerning mobilization, training and recognition of volunteers. The resolution stresses that support for voluntary action does not imply support for government downsizing, nor for replacing paid employment.\nThe Commission also adopted a resolution on Preparation For and Observance of the Tenth Anniversary of the Year of the Family. In it the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) urges the General Assembly to view year 2004 as a target year by which concrete achievements should be made to identify and elaborate issues that are of direct concern to families.\nFinally, the Commission approved its multi-year programme of work and recommended the programme to the United Nations Economic and Social Council.\nContact: NGO Liaison Officer, Division of Social Policy and Development, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), United Nations, New York NY 10017, United States, fax +1-212/963 3062, e-mail < ngoran@un.org >, website ( www.un.org/esa/socdev ).\nCSD HOLDS INTERSESSIONAL MEETINGS\nThe Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD) held intersessional meetings in New York from 6-16 March 2001 to discuss the topics of Transport and Atmosphere, and Information for Decision Making and Participation and International Cooperation for an Enabling Environment. Each of the two themes was discussed by an Ad Hoc Working Group, which produced a summary and outline of elements for a draft decision on each theme, to be considered by the ninth session of the CSD in April.\nFor the most part, cooperation and a lack of significant disagreement among governments characterized discussions in the working groups on Transport and Atmosphere. This was due in part to the fact that the more contentious aspects of these issues are being taken up in other fora, such as energy by the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Energy and Sustainable Development, and atmosphere by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Instead, delegations highlighted other aspects of the transport and atmosphere debate: the human-related aspects of transportation (such as those affecting women and the elderly), health and urban planning, and the affordability and accessibility of transport.\nIn discussing the document containing elements for a draft decision on transport, a block of developing countries emphasized the importance of, among other things, new and additional resources from developed country partners, technology transfer, support for capacity building, and affordable and accessible transport systems.\nA block of developed countries suggested that some priorities for CSD-9 in this area could include introducing the concepts of internalization of external costs and the polluter pays principle, as well as calling on international financial institutions and donors to make sustainable transport a priority.\nA section on international cooperation recommended supporting public-private partnerships based on national priorities; developing endogenous capacity for both development and production of appropriate technologies; progressive phasing out of the use of lead in gasoline; and undertaking measures to promote the use of cleaner fuels.\nThe Working Group on Information for Decision Making and Participation and International Cooperation for an Enabling Environment took up three main issues under information, one of which focused on bridging the data gap. There was significant disagreement regarding the use of a core set of indicators for use in national reporting for sustainable development, as many developing countries regarded this as a possible tool of conditionality from donor countries. A block of developing countries stressed the need to make the use of indicators voluntary, take into account national particularities, and be sure they are suited to country-specific conditions and do not lead to conditionalities in the provision of aid and support to developing countries.\nThe Working Group also discussed the issue of improving the availability of and access to information, and many delegations emphasized the continuing need for development and deployment of information standards. A number of delegations mentioned the need to find ways to balance the positive effects of a market-driven system of information with the continuing need to ensure free and open public access to such information.\nA third area of discussion focused on new information technologies. It was generally agreed that the emergence of a new knowledge economy offers a great potential for more effective, wider and faster collection and dissemination of information and public participation. In this regard, delegations noted the importance of trying to reach out to excluded groups such as the poor, women, rural communities and indigenous peoples.\nThe document on elements for a draft decision on the theme of information technologies highlights the need for technology transfer, capacity building, and new and additional resources to modernize and establish information systems in developing countries, particularly among poor populations. Recommendations to the CSD included: encouraging international organizations to rationalize their requests for information with respect to voluntary national reports; and ensuring that the commercialization of information does not become a barrier to developing countries.\nBoth developed and developing delegations raised the importance of initiatives at the national level to create a domestic environment conducive to private investment. Some delegations noted the role of the private sector in promoting the development of cleaner technologies and in contributing to sustainable development, including through the Global Compact initiative.\nThe Working Group put forward to CSD-9 a number of possible Elements for a Draft Decision. These included: support developing countries in their efforts toward sustainable development; explore ways in which official development assistance (ODA) and private resource flows can play complimentary roles; improve the functioning of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to make it more responsive to the needs of developing countries; eliminate trade obstacles including discriminatory trade practices, protectionist policies, non-tariff barriers and trade-distorting subsidies; formulate and implement national sustainable development programmes; and improve opportunities for the private sector, NGOs and Major Groups to contribute to sustainable development, economic planning and poverty eradication.\nContact: Zehra Aydin-Sipos, Major Groups Programme Coordinator, Division for Sustainable Development, DESA, 2 United Nations Plaza, 22nd Floor, New York NY 10017, United States, telephone +1-212/963 8811, fax +1-212/963 4260, e-mail < aydin@un.org >, website ( www.un.org/esa/sustdev ).\nAFRICA AND ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONS PREPARE FOR RACISM CONFERENCE\nThe final two intergovernmental regional meetings and parallel NGO forums for the upcoming World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance (WCAR) were held in Dakar (Senegal) from 20-24 January 2001, and in Teheran (Iran) from 17-21 February 2001. Go Between summarizes the discussions and recommendations of the two meetings.\nGovernments and NGOs gathered in Dakar and Teheran to define their common positions for the WCAR, which will be held in Durban (South Africa) from 31 August-7 September 2001. An NGO Forum to be held from 28 August to 1 September, and a Youth Forum starting 27 August, will also be held in the same city. The outcome documents adopted by the regional meetings will be fed into the WCAR preparatory process.\nDakar Meeting\nThe intergovernmental meeting in Dakar brought together government delegates from all African countries. Mary Robinson, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and Secretary-General of WCAR, called attention to issues ranging from traditional and contemporary forms of slavery, trafficking in children and women, the gender dimension of racism, and exclusion of the disabled and of persons living with HIV/AIDS, to environmental degradation and pollution.\nParticipants discussed, among other things, the recommendations from a meeting of African NGOs in Botswana in early January 2001, and they reviewed a report of a seminar of experts on the prevention of ethnic and racial conflicts in Africa, held in October 2000 in Ethiopia.\nAt the Dakar meeting governments adopted a Declaration and Recommendations for a Programme of Action. These focus on the impact of the slave trade and colonialism, and compensation for individuals as well as countries that suffered their consequences. The Declaration identifies the slave trade, particularly of Africans, as \u0093a unique tragedy in the history of humanity [and] a crime against humanity which is unparalleled. The consequences of this tragedy [have resulted in] lasting economic, political and cultural damage to African peoples and are still present [in] the perpetration of prejudice against Africans in the continent and people of African descent in the Diaspora.\u0094\nThe Declaration calls for recognition of past injustices but warns that this would be meaningless without explicit apologies for those violations by ex-colonial powers or their successors. The Recommendations for a Programme of Action suggest establishing an International Compensation Scheme for victims of the slave trade and victims of any other transnational racist policies and acts; setting up a Development Reparation Fund to provide resources for a development process in countries affected by colonialism; and establishing international mechanisms for follow-up and monitoring of racism-related issues.\nThe NGO Forum recommended that states assure full participation in the WCAR of indigenous people, and stressed the particular vulnerability of refugees and migrants to racial discrimination.\nTeheran Meeting\nThe intergovernmental meeting in Teheran brought together government representatives from the Asian and Pacific regions.\nThe Teheran Declaration adopted by governments stresses, among other things, the need for understanding and dialogue among cultures and civilizations, which it says \u0093facilitates the promotion of a culture of tolerance and respect for diversity.\u0094\nSlavery and colonialism, according to the Declaration, \u0093have been the prime sources and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.\u0094 It affirms that \u0093foreign occupation founded on settlements [constitutes] a new kind of apartheid, a crime against humanity [and] a form of genocide.\u0094 It expresses \u0093deep regret\u0094 over the \u0093racial discrimination to which the Palestinians and other inhabitants of the Arab territories occupied by Israel are subjected.\u0094\nThe Declaration also stipulates the \u0093adverse trends of globalization, including growing economic disparity and cultural homogenization, which\u0085contribute to sustaining and strengthening racist attitudes.\u0094 It draws attention to the growing plight of migrants and trafficking in persons and calls upon states to address the root causes of racism such as inter-ethnic strife, poverty and armed conflict.\nAmong issues the Teheran meeting NGO Forum stressed should be included on the WCAR agenda were caste-based discrimination. Although some 160 million people in India face caste-based discrimination, Human Rights Watch representative Smita Narula noted, there was still \u0093a lot of resistance from the Indian government to have it included on the [WCAR] agenda.\u0094\nMary Robinson expressed her dismay at what she described as \u0093procedural and technical\u0094 difficulties that did not allow two accredited NGOs in Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council to attend the regional meeting in Teheran.\nContact: Laurie Wiseberg, NGO Liaison Officer for the World Conference Against Racism, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Palais Wilson, CH-1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland, telephone +41-22/917 9393, fax +41-22/917 9050, e-mail < lwiseberg.hchr@unog.ch >, website ( www.unhchr.ch/html/racism/index.htm ).

It argues that the South must be given room for manoeuvre and proposes what are described as innovative and realistic policies for this.\nThe Development Myth: The Non-Viable Countries of the 21st Century\nThis book says that several countries in the South are becoming \u0093non-viable national economies\u0094 rather than newly industrialized countries. It notes that these countries will need to adopt a policy of national survival based on the search for water, food and energy security, as well as stabilization of their populations.\nThe Water Manifesto: Arguments for a World Water Contract\nAccording to this book, three billion of the eight billion people on earth in 2020 will lack access to sufficient and safe drinking water if present trends continue. It gives examples of how corporate interests view water as a commodity, rather than as a resource and human right.

It is best known for being made of non-petroleum materials,biodegradable and causing issues with existing waste disposal infrastructure.

Cotton was better for the consumer in a multitude of ways. Its organic properties made it more comfortable to wear in hot weather, and what could be more luxuriant than to be enveloped in soft, smooth, cotton sheets on balmy summer nights? A whole raft of advertising wafted the consumer away to a world of flower meadows, songbirds and flawless white wholesomeness.\nBaby magazines are full of pure cotton products and we happily subscribe to the notion that if we want to be seen as a caring parent our baby will be wrapped, clothed, and washed in only the purest of products. This is a very natural emotion and one that thousands of new mums everyday are succumbing to. We are all very aware of the need to preserve the planet for future generations who are to inherit it after us, so we key- in to the fell-good factor that using a natural, renewable product can give. But perhaps we should be looking at alternatives to 'King Cotton'.\nThe statistics concerning the production of cotton can come as a bit of a shock, and it's not something most of us ever bother to explore too deeply. Cotton is beneficial to the user, and the producer. It provides employment for millions of otherwise impoverished people in the Far East and Asia, and United States and Australian exporters rely heavily on it for revenue. So on the surface it would seem to be a winner. But just have a look at some of these stats:\nCotton growing uses 10% of the world's pesticides and 25% of the world's insecticides. The main reason for this high percentage is that a crop can need up to 9 applications during the growing period. In some countries such as China up to 20 applications are required.\nTo turn raw cotton into material involves the use of over 8,000 different chemicals which the WHO has listed as being moderately to extremely hazardous to humans. No mention is made of the toxic effect on the non-invasive insects, and birds. It's disturbing to discover that the gas from one of the pesticides used on cotton plantations was responsible for the Bhopal factory explosion which claimed something in the region of 3,00 lives.\nOn large plantations such as those found in the USA, Australia, and SE Asia, huge amounts of water are required for irrigation. China alone uses 370 million cubic metres per year.\nAnd then there are the energy costs. The electricity required to produce one tonne of cotton will use 2 \u00bd tonnes of oil.\nMakes you think doesn't it?\nAnd that's just to produce bales of white cotton. When the dyeing process begins the waste product from that will find its way into the environment via the waste water system where it will join the diluted formaldehyde that has been used in the finishing process.\nSo what's the alternative? Well for many years now work has been done by Pesticide Action network UK (PAN UK) and other organisations on producing organic cotton, using totally natural pest control. This work is being developed in Sub-Saharan Africa, and they are increasing production year on year but there's still along way to go before they can satisfy the market.\nSo until then? How about alternative fibres?\nMention the word 'hemp' and an image of pot-smoking hippies come to mind. Along with brown lentils, love-ins and Haight-Ashbury. But forget the starchy-stiff feel and the grunge colours of the nineteen sixties product. Hemp has shaken off it's home spun characteristics and over the last few years better production techniques have produced a more commercial, consumer- friendly product.\nHemp ( and its close cousin cannabis) has been around for centuries,in fact hemp cloth has been found in tombs that were around 10,000 years before Christianity, but it wasn't until 1993 that UK farmers were legally allowed to grow it. Which was strange, considering that there was a vital difference between cannabis and hemp, although the plants look almost identical. That difference is the chemical tetrahydrocannabinol, a hugely long word for the ingredient found in cannabis that sends the smoker off to the land of fairies. Hemp fields today are still routinely plundered by amateur 'potheads' who wonder later why their spliffs aren't having any noticeable effect.\nHemp plants are resistant to most of the pests that plague cotton production, so very little pesticide is used during growing, and the plant grows very quickly. But what other eco-friendly properties does it have? Well, for a start it's entirely biodegradable and extremely durable, so when it eventually does wear out and is consigned to the landfill site it will rot down to compost. It can be mixed with other natural fibres such as organic cotton, and silk to produce a soft, yet hard-wearing material. So sheets, diapers and clothing all last that bit longer, combining ecology for the benefit of the planet, with economy for the benefit of the consumer. As it is by nature a creamy white colour it requires very little bleaching, which in turn accounts for far less harmful by-products in the atmosphere. Hemp is also claimed to be a better insulator, more resistant to mould, and more absorbent than cotton. It is apparently very efficient at blocking the sun's ultraviolet rays, and as well as this built-in safety feature the dyed material is less likely to fade.\nA relatively new contender for an eco-friendly replacement for cotton is bamboo. Like hemp it is naturally light- coloured, so it requires minimal bleaching, and it has all the insulating qualities of hemp combined with the softness of cotton. This natural softness contrasts with the stiffer qualities of hemp( although hemp manufacturers claim that their material softens with repeated washing and ironing). Bamboo, on the face of it would seem to be a 'miracle' product. It's is less expensive to buy than other materiel, it's quick drying and naturally crease-resistant. It's also claimed to be non-allergenic, particularly good news for people with skin allergies...but that depends on the manufacturing processes of course. The plant itself grows quicker than it's rivals, requires very little water,cleans the air by absorbing carbon dioxide (up to 12 tonnes per hectare) and can survive floods or drought.\nThere must be a catch somewhere. And there is. There is still much work to be done on safely turning bamboo into cloth. Most of the worlds bamboo is processed into fabric in China, and there are some points to be raised on the subject of the Social Accountability Code(SA 8000) which seeks to protect workers from exposure to toxic chemicals and the use of child labour. Though bamboo may have some environmental shortcomings it still has the advantage over cotton, with its attendant pesticides, or synthetic material like polyester which can discharge toxic gases into the atmosphere, not least of which is the old enemy - carbon dioxide.\nClearly the jury is still out on the environmental claims for bamboo but this is not to say it's all bad, as it still compares favourably with hemp, and promises to be an improvement on cotton growing.\nGoing green, and trying to cut down your personal carbon footprint can seem like walking through a minefield, so don't become too bogged down with conflicting advice. Read labels carefully and try to see through some of the hype. If you have made a conscious decision to 'green-up' your life you're halfway there already. At the moment the perfect green product doesn't exist so don't expect to perform your own eco-miracle. The most we can hope for is to not make the situation any worse.\n"}, {"score": 637.17334, "uuid": "90a9ba57-1612-526e-a9c6-d84ef702022b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0610wb-45-22769", "target_hostname": "www.rules.utah.gov", "target_uri": "http://www.rules.utah.gov/publicat/code/r315/r315-008.htm", "page_rank": 1.1726596e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Standards for Owners <em>and</em> Operators of Hazardous <em>Waste</em> Treatment,", "snippet": "Determining Resistance of Plastics to Bacteria; or (iii) <em>The</em> sorbent material is determined to be <em>non</em>-<em>biodegradable</em> under <em>the</em> Organization for Economic Cooperation <em>and</em> Development (OECD) test 301B, CO2 Evolution, Modified Sturm Test.", "explanation": null, "document": "(iv) Geomembranes, flexible membrane liners;\n(v) Leachate collection and removal systems and leak detection systems; and\n(vi) Final cover systems.\n(b) Written CQA plan.

Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures.\n4.1 APPLICABILITY\nThe regulations in this section apply to the owners and operators of all hazardous waste management facilities, except as provided otherwise in R315-8-1(e).\n4.2 PURPOSE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CONTINGENCY PLAN\n(a) Each owner or operator shall have a contingency plan for his facility. The contingency plan shall be designed to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden discharge of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, groundwater, or surface water.\n(b) The provisions of the plan shall be carried out immediately whenever there is a fire, explosion, or discharge of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents which could threaten the environment or human health.\n4.3 CONTENT OF CONTINGENCY PLAN\n(a) The plan shall describe the actions facility personnel shall take to comply with R315-8-4.2 and R315-8-4.7 in response to fires, explosions or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden discharge of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water at the facility. If a facility owner or operator already has prepared a Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan in accordance with 40 CFR 112, or some other emergency or contingency plan, he need only amend that plan to incorporate hazardous waste management provisions sufficient to comply with the requirements of this section.\n(b) The plan shall describe arrangements agreed to by local law enforcement agencies, fire departments, hospitals, contractors, and State and local emergency response teams to coordinate emergency services pursuant to R315-8-3.7.\n(c) The plan shall list names, addresses and phone numbers, office and home, of all persons qualified to act as facility emergency coordinator, see R315-8-4.6, and this list shall be kept up-to-date. Where more than one person is listed, one shall be named as primary emergency coordinator and others shall be listed in the order in which they assume responsibility as alternates. For new facilities, this information shall be supplied to the Board before operations begin rather than at the time of submission of the plan.\n(d) The plan shall include a list of all emergency equipment at the facility, such as fire extinguishing systems, discharge control equipment, communications and alarm systems, internal and external, and decontamination equipment, where this equipment is required. This list shall be kept up-to-date. In addition, the plan shall include the location and a physical description of each item on the list, and a brief outline of its capabilities.\n(e) The plan shall include an evacuation plan for facility personnel where there is a possibility that evacuation could be necessary. This plan shall describe signal(s) to be used to begin evacuation, evacuation routes, and alternate evacuation routes, in cases where the primary routes could be blocked by discharges of hazardous waste or fires.\n4.4 COPIES OF A CONTINGENCY PLAN\nA copy of the contingency plan and all revisions to the plan shall be:\n(a) Maintained at the facility;\n(b) Made available upon request; and\n(c) Submitted to all local law enforcement agencies, fire departments, hospitals, and State and local emergency response teams that may be called upon to provide emergency services.\nThe contingency plan shall be submitted to the Board with part B of the permit application under R315- 3 and after modification or approval will become a condition of any permit issued.\n4.5 AMENDMENT OF CONTINGENCY PLAN\nThe contingency plan shall be reviewed, and immediately amended, if necessary, under any of the following circumstances:\n(a) Revisions to the facility permit;\n(b) Failure of the plan in an emergency;\n(c) Changes in the facility design, construction, operation, maintenance, or other circumstances that materially increase the potential for fires, explosions, or discharges of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents, or changes the response necessary in an emergency;\n(d) Changes in the list of emergency coordinators; or\n(e) Changes in the list of emergency equipment.\n4.6 EMERGENCY COORDINATOR\nAt all times there shall be at least one employee either present on the facility premises or on call, i.e., available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short time period, with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures. This facility emergency coordinator shall be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facility's contingency plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location and characteristics of waste handled, the location of manifests and all other records within the facility, and the facility layout. In addition, this person shall have the authority to commit the resources needed to carry out the contingency plan. The emergency coordinator's responsibilities are more fully spelled out in R315-8-4.7. Applicable responsibilities for the emergency coordinator vary, depending on factors such as type and variety of waste(s) handled by the facility, and type and complexity of the facility.\n4.7 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES\n(a) Whenever there is an imminent or actual emergency situation, the facility's emergency coordinator, or his designee when the emergency coordinator is on call, shall immediately:\n(1) Activate internal facility alarms or communication systems, where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and\n(2) Notify appropriate State or local agencies with designated response roles whenever their assistance is needed.\n(b) In the event of a discharge, fire, or explosion, the facility's emergency coordinator shall immediately identify the character, exact source, amount, and areal extent of any discharged materials. He may do this by observation or review of facility records or manifests, and, if necessary, by chemical analysis.\n(c) Concurrently, the facility's emergency coordinator shall assess possible hazards to the environment or human health that may result from the discharge, fire, or explosion. This assessment shall consider both direct and indirect effects of the discharge, fire, or explosion, e.g., the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-off or hazardous groundwater infiltration from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced explosions.\n(d) The facility's emergency coordinator shall immediately report his assessment that the facility has had a discharge, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or the environment, outside the facility, as follows:\n(1) If his assessment indicates that evacuation of local areas may be advisable, he shall immediately notify appropriate local authorities. He shall be available to assist appropriate officials in making the decision whether local areas should be evacuated; and\n(2) He shall immediately notify both the Utah State Department of Environmental Quality as specified in R315-9 and the government official designated as the on-scene coordinator for that geographical area, in the applicable regional contingency plan, or the National Response Center (800/424-8802). The report shall include:\n(i) Name and telephone number of reporter;\n(ii) Name and address of facility;\n(iii) Time and type of incident, e.g., discharge, fire;\n(iv) Name and quantity of material(s) involved, to the extent available;\n(v) The extent of injuries, if any; and\n(vi) The possible hazards to human health, or the environment, outside the facility.\n(e) During an emergency, the facility's emergency coordinator shall take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and discharges do not occur, recur, or spread to other hazardous waste at the facility. These measures shall include, where applicable, stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing discharged waste, and removing or isolating containers.\n(f) If the facility stops operations in response to a discharge, fire, or explosion, the facility's emergency coordinator shall monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, wherever this is appropriate.\n(g) Immediately after an emergency, the emergency coordinator shall provide for treating, storing, or disposing of recovered waste, contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that results from a discharge, fire, or explosion at the facility. The recovered material shall be handled and managed as a hazardous waste unless it is analyzed and determined not to be, using the procedures specified in R315-2.\n(h) The facility's emergency coordinator shall ensure that, in the affected area(s) of the facility:\n(1) No waste that may be incompatible with the released material is treated, stored, or disposed of until cleanup procedures are completed; and\n(2) All emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are resumed.\n(i) The facility owner or operator shall notify the Executive Secretary and other appropriate State and local authorities, that the facility is in compliance with R315-8-4.7(h) before operations are resumed in the affected area(s) of the facility.\n(j) The facility owner or operator shall record in the operating record the time, date, and nature of any incident that requires implementing the contingency plan. Within 15 days after the incident, he shall submit a written report on the emergency to the Executive Secretary. The report shall include:\n(1) Name, address, and telephone number of the owner or operator;\n(2) Name, address, and telephone number of the facility;\n(3) Date, time, and type of incident, e.g., fire, discharge;\n(4) Name and quantity of material(s) involved;\n(5) The extent of injuries, if any;\n(6) An assessment of actual or potential hazards to the environment or human health, where this is applicable; and\n(7) Estimated quantity and disposition of recovered material that resulted from the incident.\nR315-8-5.

R315-8-5.3, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264.73(b) only applies to permittees who treat, store, or dispose of hazardous wastes on- site where such wastes were generated.\n5.2 USE OF MANIFEST SYSTEM\n(a)(1) If a facility receives hazardous waste accompanied by a manifest, the owner or operator, or his agent, shall sign and date the manifest as indicated in R315-8-5.2(a)(2) to certify that the hazardous waste covered by the manifest was received, that the hazardous waste was received except as noted in the discrepancy space of the manifest, or that the hazardous waste was rejected as noted in the manifest discrepancy space.\n(2) If a facility receives a hazardous waste shipment accompanied by a manifest, the owner, operator or his agent shall:\n(i) Sign and date, by hand, each copy of the manifest;\n(ii) Note any discrepancies in the manifest, as defined in R315-8-5.4(a), on each copy of the manifest;\n(iii) Immediately give the transporter at least one copy of the signed manifest;\n(iv) Within 30 days of the delivery, send a copy of the manifest to the generator; and\n(v) Retain at the facility a copy of each manifest for at least three years from the date of delivery.\n(3) If a facility receives hazardous waste imported from a foreign source, the receiving facility shall mail a copy of the manifest to the following addresses within 30 days of delivery: International Compliance Assurance Division, OFA/OECA (2254A), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ariel Rios Building, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington DC 20460 and Utah Division of Solid and Hazardous Waste, P O Box 144880, Salt Lake City, Utah 84114-4880.\n(b) If a facility receives, from a rail or water (bulk shipment) transporter, hazardous waste which is accompanied by a shipping paper containing all the information required on the manifest (excluding the EPA identification numbers, generator's certification, and signatures), the owner or operator, or his agent, shall:\n(1) Sign and date each copy of the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received) to certify that the hazardous waste covered by the manifest or shipping paper was received;\n(2) Note any significant discrepancies, as defined in R315-8-5.4(a), in the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received) on each copy of the manifest or shipping paper.\nComment: The Agency does not intend that the owner or operator of a facility whose procedures under R315-8-2.4, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264.13(c), include waste analysis shall perform that analysis before signing the shipping paper and giving it to the transporter. R315-8-5.4(b), however, requires reporting an unreconciled discrepancy discovered during later analysis.\n(3) Immediately give the rail or water (bulk shipment) transporter at least one copy of the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received);\n(4) Within 30 days after the delivery, send a copy of the signed and dated manifest or a signed and dated copy of the shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received within 30 days after delivery) to the generator; and\nComment: R315-5-2.23(c) requires the generator to send three copies of the manifest to the facility when hazardous waste is sent by rail or water (bulk shipment).\n(5) Retain at the facility a copy of the manifest and shipping paper (if signed in lieu of the manifest at the time of delivery) for at least three years from the date of delivery.\n(c) Whenever a shipment of hazardous waste is initiated from a facility, the owner or operator of that facility shall comply with the requirements of R315-5.\nComment: The provisions of R315-5-3.34, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 262.34, are applicable to the on-site accumulation of hazardous wastes by generators. Therefore, the provisions of R315-5-3.34, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 262.34, only apply to owners or operators who are shipping hazardous waste which they generated at that facility.\n(d) Within three working days of the receipt of a shipment subject to R315 -5-8, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 262, subpart H, the owner or operator of the facility shall provide a copy of the tracking document bearing all required signatures to the notifier, to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Compliance, Enforcement Planning, Targeting and Data Division (2222A), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, and to competent authorities of all other concerned countries. The original copy of the tracking document shall be maintained at the facility for at least three years from the date of signature.\n(e) A facility shall determine whether the consignment state for a shipment regulates any additional wastes (beyond those regulated Federally) as hazardous wastes under its state hazardous waste program. Facilities shall also determine whether the consignment state or generator state requires the facility to submit any copies of the manifest to these states.\n5.3 OPERATING RECORD\nThe requirements as found in 40 CFR 264.73, 2000 ed., are adopted and incorporated by reference.\n5.4 MANIFEST DISCREPANCIES\n(a) Manifest discrepancies are:\n(1) Significant discrepancies (as defined by R315-8-5.4(b)) between the quantity or type of hazardous waste designated on the manifest or shipping paper, and the quantity and type of hazardous waste a facility actually receives;\n(2) Rejected wastes, which may be a full or partial shipment of hazardous waste that the treatment, storage, or disposal facility cannot accept; or\n(3) Container residues, which are residues that exceed the quantity limits for \"empty\" containers set forth in R315-2-7(b).\n(b) Significant discrepancies in quantity are: for batch waste, any variation in piece count, such as a discrepancy of one drum in a truckload; for bulk waste, variations greater than 10 percent in weight. Significant discrepancies in type are obvious differences which can be discovered by inspection or waste analysis, such as waste solvent substituted for waste acid, or toxic constituents not reported on the manifest or shipping paper.\n(c) Upon discovering a significant discrepancy, the owner or operator shall attempt to reconcile the discrepancy with the waste generator or transporter, e.g., with telephone conversations. If the discrepancy is not resolved within 15 days after receiving the waste, the owner or operator shall immediately submit to the Executive Secretary a letter describing the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it, and a copy of the manifest or shipping paper at issue.\n(d)(1) Upon rejecting waste or identifying a container residue that exceeds the quantity limits for \"empty\" containers set forth in R315-2-7(b), the facility shall consult with the generator prior to forwarding the waste to another facility that can manage the waste. If it is impossible to locate an alternative facility that can receive the waste, the facility may return the rejected waste or residue to the generator. The facility shall send the waste to the alternative facility or to the generator within 60 days of the rejection or the container residue identification.\n(2) While the facility is making arrangements for forwarding rejected wastes or residues to another facility under R315-8-5.4, it must ensure that either the delivering transporter retains custody of the waste, or, the facility shall provide for secure, temporary custody of the waste, pending delivery of the waste to the first transporter designated on the manifest prepared under R315-8-5.4(e) or (f).\n(e) Except as provided in R315-8-5.4(e)(7), for full or partial load rejections and residues that are to be sent off-site to an alternate facility, the facility is required to prepare a new manifest in accordance with R315-5-2.20(a) and the following instructions:\n(1) Write the generator's U.S. EPA ID number in Item 1 of the new manifest.

The facility shall retain a copy of this manifest for its records, and then give the remaining copies of the manifest to the transporter to accompany the shipment. If the original manifest is not used, then the facility shall use a new manifest and comply with R315-8- 5.4(e)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6).\n(f) Except as provided in R315-8-5.4(f)(7), for rejected wastes and residues that shall be sent back to the generator, the facility is required to prepare a new manifest in accordance with R315-5-2.20(a) and the following instructions:\n(1) Write the facility's U.S. EPA ID number in Item 1 of the new manifest. Write the facility's name and mailing address in Item 5 of the new manifest. If the mailing address is different from the facility's site address, then write the facility's site address in the designated space for Item 5 of the new manifest.\n(2) Write the name of the initial generator and the generator's U.S. EPA ID number in the designated facility block (Item 8) of the new manifest.\n(3) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the old manifest to the Special Handling and Additional Information Block of the new manifest, and indicate that the shipment is a residue or rejected waste from the previous shipment.\n(4) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the new manifest to the manifest reference number line in the Discrepancy Block of the old manifest (Item 18a).\n(5) Write the DOT description for the rejected load or the residue in Item 9 (U.S. DOT Description) of the new manifest and write the container types, quantity, and volume(s) of waste.\n(6) Sign the Generator's/Offeror's Certification to certify, as offeror of the shipment, that the waste has been properly packaged, marked, and labeled and is in proper condition for transportation.\n(7) For full load rejections that are made while the transporter remains at the facility, the facility may return the shipment to the generator with the original manifest by completing Item 18a and 18b of the manifest and supplying the generator's information in the Alternate Facility space. The facility shall retain a copy for its records and then give the remaining copies of the manifest to the transporter to accompany the shipment. If the original manifest is not used, then the facility shall use a new manifest and comply with R315-8-5.4(f)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (8).\n(8) For full or partial load rejections and container residues contained in non-empty containers that are returned to the generator, the facility must also comply with the exception reporting requirements in R315-5- 4.42(a)(1).\n(g) If a facility rejects a waste or identifies a container residue that exceeds the quantity limits for \"empty\" containers set forth in R315-2-7(b) after it has signed, dated, and returned a copy of the manifest to the delivering transporter or to the generator, the facility shall amend its copy of the manifest to indicate the rejected wastes or residues in the discrepancy space of the amended manifest. The facility shall also copy the manifest tracking number from Item 4 of the new manifest to the Discrepancy space of the amended manifest, and shall re-sign and date the manifest to certify to the information as amended. The facility shall retain the amended manifest for at least three years from the date of amendment, and shall within 30 days, send a copy of the amended manifest to the transporter and generator that received copies prior to their being amended.\n5.5 AVAILABILITY, RETENTION, AND DISPOSITION OF RECORDS\n(a) Records of waste disposal locations and quantities required to be maintained under R315-8-5.3, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264.73(b)(2) shall be submitted to the Board and local land authority upon closure of the facility.\n(b) The retention period for all records required under this section is extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the facility or as requested by the Executive Secretary.\n(c) All records, including plans, required under R315-8 shall be furnished upon request, and made available at all reasonable times for inspection.\n5.6 BIENNIAL REPORT\nOwners or operators of facilities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste shall prepare and submit a single copy of an biennial report to the Board by March 1 of each even numbered year. The biennial report shall be submitted on EPA form 8700-13B. The biennial report shall cover facility activities during the previous calendar year and shall include the following information:\n(a) The EPA identification number, name, and address of the facility;\n(b) The calendar year covered by the report;\n(c) For off-site facilities, the EPA identification number of each hazardous waste generator from which a hazardous waste was received during the year; for imported shipments, the name and address of the foreign generator shall be given in the report;\n(d) A description and the quantity of each hazardous waste received by the facility during the year. For off-site facilities, this information shall be listed by EPA identification number of each generator;\n(e) The method(s) of treatment, storage, or disposal for each hazardous waste; and\n(f) The most recent closure cost estimate under R315-8-8, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264. 140 - 264.151, and for disposal facilities, the most recent post-closure cost estimate under R315-8-8, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264.140 - 264.151; and\n(g) For generators who treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste on-site, a description of the efforts undertaken during the year to reduce the volume and toxicity of waste generated;\n(h) For generators who treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste on-site, a description of the changes in volume and toxicity of waste actually achieved during the year in comparison to previous years to the extent the information is available for the years prior to 1984;\n(i) The certification signed by the owner or operator of the facility or his authorized representative.\n5.7 UNMANIFESTED WASTE REPORT\n(a) If a facility accepts for treatment, storage, or disposal any hazardous waste from an off-site source without an accompanying manifest, or without an accompanying shipping paper as described in R315-6-2.20(e)(2), and if the waste is not excluded from the manifest requirement of R315, then the owner or operator shall prepare and submit a letter to the Executive Secretary within 15 days of the receipt of the waste. The unmanifested waste report shall include the following information:\n(1) The EPA identification number, name, and address of the facility;\n(2) The date of receipt of the waste;\n(3) The EPA identification number, name and address of the generator and the transporter, if available;\n(4) A description and the quantity of each unmanifested hazardous waste the facility received;\n(5) The method of treatment, storage, or disposal for each hazardous waste;\n(6) The certification signed by the owner or operator of the facility or his authorized representative; and\n(7) A brief explanation of why the waste was unmanifested, if known.\n5.8 ADDITIONAL REPORTS\nIn addition to the biennial and unmanifested waste reporting requirements described in R315-8-5.6 and R315-8, a facility owner operator shall also report the following to the Board:\n(a) Discharges, fires, and explosions as specified in R315-8-4.7(j);\n(b) Upon its request, all information as the Board may deem necessary to determine compliance with the requirements of R315-8;\n(c) Facility closure as specified in R315-8-7, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264.110 - 264.120; and\n(d) As otherwise required in R315-8-6, R315-8-11, R315-8-12, R315-8-13, R315-8-14, R315-8-17, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264-1030 - 264.1036, R315-8-18, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264.1050 - 264.1065, and R315-8-22, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264.1080 - 264.1090.\nR315-8-6. Groundwater Protection.\n6.1 APPLICABILITY\n(a)(1) Except as provided in R315-8-6.1(b), R315-8-6 applies to owners or operators of facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. The owner or operator shall satisfy the requirements identified in R315-8- 6.1(a)(2) for all wastes, or constituents thereof, contained in solid waste management units at the facility, regardless of the time at which waste was placed in the units.\n(2) All solid waste management units shall comply with the requirements in R315-8-6.12. A surface impoundment, waste pile, and land treatment unit or landfill that receives hazardous waste after July 26, 1982, hereinafter referred to as a \"regulated unit\", shall comply with the requirements of R315-8-6.2 through R315-8-6.11 in lieu of R315-8- 6.12 for purposes of detecting, characterizing and responding to releases to the uppermost aquifer. The financial responsibility requirements of R315-8-6.12 apply to regulated units.\n(3) Groundwater monitoring shall be required at non-land disposal facilities as determined to be necessary and appropriate by the Executive Secretary.\n(b) The owner or operator's regulated unit or units are not subject to regulation for releases into the uppermost aquifer under R315-8-6 if:\n(1) The owner or operator is exempted under R315-8-1(e) or\n(2) He operates a unit which the Board finds:\n(i) Is an engineered structure.\n(ii) Does not receive or contain liquid waste or waste containing free liquid.\n(iii) Is designed and operated to exclude liquid, precipitation, and other run-on and run-off.\n(iv) Has both inner and outer layers of containment enclosing the waste.\n(v) Has a leak detection system built into each containment layer.\n(vi) The owner or operator will provide continuing operation and maintenance of these leak detection systems during the active life of the unit and the closure and post-closure care periods, and\n(vii) To a reasonable degree of certainty, will not allow hazardous constituents to migrate beyond the outer containment layer prior to the end of the post-closure care period.\n(3) The Board finds pursuant to R315-8-13.11(d) that the treatment zone of a land treatment unit that qualifies as a regulated unit does not contain levels of hazardous constituents that are above background levels of those constituents by an amount that is statistically significant, and if an unsaturated zone monitoring program meeting the requirements of R315-8-13.9 has not shown a statistically significant increase in hazardous constituents below the treatment zone during the operating life of the unit. An exemption under this paragraph can only relieve an owner or operator of responsibility to meet the requirements of this subpart during the post-closure care period; or\n(4) The Board finds that there is no potential for migration of liquid from a regulated unit to the uppermost aquifer during the active life of the regulated unit, including the closure period and the post-closure care period specified under R315-8-7, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264.110 - 264.120. This demonstration shall be certified by a qualified geologist or geotechnical engineer. In order to provide an adequate margin of safety in the prediction of potential migration of liquid, the owner or operator shall base any predictions made under this paragraph on assumptions that maximize the rate of liquid migration.\n(5) He designs and operates a waste pile in compliance with R315-8-12.1(c).\n(c) The regulations under this section apply during the active life of the regulated unit, including the closure period. After closure of the regulated unit, the regulations in this section:\n(1) Do not apply if the waste, waste residues, contaminated containment system components, and contaminated subsoils are removed or decontaminated at closure;\n(2) Apply during the post-closure care period under R315-8-7, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264.110 - 264-120, if the owner or operator is conducting a detection monitoring program under R315-8-6.9;\n(3) Apply during the compliance period under R315-8-6.7 the owner is conducting a compliance monitoring program under R315-8-6.10 or a corrective action program under R315-8-6.11.\n(d) Requirements in this section may apply to miscellaneous units when necessary to comply with R315- 8-24, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264.601 - 264.603.\n(e) The regulations of R315-8-6 apply to all owners and operators subject to the requirements of R315-3-1.1(e)(7), when the Executive Secretary issues either a post-closure permit or an enforceable document, as defined in R315-3-1.1(e)(7), at the facility. When the Executive Secretary issues an enforceable document, references in R315-8-6 to \"in the permit\" mean \"in the enforceable document.\"\n(f) The Executive Secretary may replace all or part of the requirements of R315-8-6.2 through R315-8- 6.11 applying to a regulated unit with alternative requirements for groundwater monitoring and corrective action for releases to groundwater set out in the permit, or in an enforceable document, as defined in R315-3-1.1(e)(7) where the Executive Secretary determines that:\n(1) The regulated unit is situated among solid waste management units, or areas of concern, a release has occurred, and both the regulated unit and one or more solid waste management unit(s), or areas of concern, are likely to have contributed to the release; and\n(2) It is not necessary to apply the groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements of R315-8-6.2 through R315-8-6.11 because alternative requirements will protect human health and the environment.\n6.2 REQUIRED PROGRAMS\n(a) Owners and operators subject to this section shall conduct a monitoring and response program as follows:\n(1) Whenever hazardous constituents under R315-8-6.4, from a regulated unit are detected at the compliance point under R315-8-6.6, the owner or operator shall institute a compliance monitoring program under R315-8-6.10. Detected is defined as statistically significant evidence of contamination as described in R315-8-6.9(f);\n(2) Whenever the groundwater protection standard under R315-8-6.3, is exceeded, the owner or operator shall institute a corrective action program under R315-8-6.11. \"Exceeded\" is defined as statistically significant evidence of increased contamination as described in R315-8-6.10(d);\n(3) Whenever hazardous constituents under R315-8-6.4, from a regulated unit exceed concentration limits under R315-8-6.5 in groundwater between the compliance point under R315-8-6.6 and the downgradient facility property boundary, the owner or operator shall institute a corrective action program under R315-8-6.11; or\n(4) In all other cases, the owner or operator shall institute a detection monitoring program under R315-8-6.9.\n(b) The Executive Secretary will specify in the facility permit the specific elements of the monitoring and response program. The Executive Secretary may include one or more of the programs identified in R315-8- 6.2(a) in the facility permit as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment and will specify the circumstances under which each of the programs will be required. In deciding whether to require the owner or operator to be prepared to institute a particular program, the Executive Secretary will consider the potential adverse effects on human health and the environment that might occur before final administrative action on a permit modification application to incorporate this type of a program could be taken.\n6.3 GROUNDWATER PROTECTION STANDARD\nThe owner or operator shall comply with conditions specified in the facility permit that are designed to ensure that hazardous constituents under R315-8-6.4 that are detected in the groundwater from a regulated unit do not exceed the concentration limits under R315-8-6.5 in the uppermost aquifer underlaying the waste management area beyond the point of compliance under R315-8-6.6 during the compliance period under R315-8-6.7. The Executive Secretary will establish this groundwater protection standard in the facility permit when hazardous constituents have been detected in the groundwater.\n6.4 HAZARDOUS CONSTITUENTS\n(a) The Executive Secretary will specify in the facility permit the hazardous constituents to which the groundwater protection standard of R315-8-6.3 applies. Hazardous constituents are constituents identified in R315-50- 10, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 261, Appendix VIII, that have been detected in groundwater in the uppermost aquifer underlaying a regulated unit and that are reasonably expected to be in or derived from waste contained in a regulated unit, unless the Executive Secretary has excluded them under paragraph 8.6.4(b).\n(b) The Executive Secretary will exclude an R315-50-10 constituent from the list of hazardous constituents specified in the facility permit if he finds that the constituent is not capable of posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment. In deciding whether to grant an exemption, the Executive Secretary will consider the following:\n(1) Potential adverse effects on groundwater quality, considering:\n(i) The physical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the regulated unit, including its potential for migration;\n(ii) The hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and surrounding land;\n(iii) The quantity of groundwater and the direction of groundwater flow;\n(iv) The proximity and withdrawal rates of groundwater users;\n(v) The current and future uses of groundwater in the area;\n(vi) The existing quality of groundwater, including other sources of contamination and their cumulative impact on the groundwater quality;\n(vii) The potential for health risks caused by human exposure to waste constituents;\n(viii) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents;\n(ix) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects; and\n(2) Potential adverse effects on hydraulically-connected surface water quality, considering:\n(i) The volume and physical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the regulated unit;\n(ii) The hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and surrounding land;\n(iii) The quantity and quality of groundwater and the direction of groundwater flow;\n(iv) The patterns of rainfall in the region;\n(v) The proximity of the regulated unit to surface waters;\n(vi) The current and future uses of surface waters in the area and any water quality standards established for those surface waters;\n(vii) The existing quality of surface water, including other sources of contamination and the cumulative impact on surface water quality;\n(viii) The potential for health risks caused by human exposure to waste constituents;\n(ix) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents; and\n(x) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects.\n(c) In making any determination under R315-8-6.4(b) about the use of groundwater in the area around the facility, the Executive Secretary will consider any identification of underground sources of drinking water.\n6.5 CONCENTRATION LIMITS\n(a) The Executive Secretary will specify in the facility permit concentration limits in the groundwater for hazardous constituents established under R315-8-6.4. The concentration of a hazardous constituent:\n(1) Shall not exceed the background level of that constituent in the groundwater at the time that limit is specified in the permit; or\n(2) For any of the constituents listed in Table 1, shall not exceed the respective value given in that Table if the background level of the constituent is below the value given in Table 1; or\nTABLE 1\r\n                            Maximum Concentration of Constituents for Groundwater Protection\r\n\r\n                                                  MAXIMUM\r\n   CONSTITUENT                                    CONCENTRATION(1)\r\n\r\n   Arsenic                                              0.05\r\n\r\n   Barium                                               1.0\r\n\r\n   Cadmium                                              0.01\r\n\r\n   Chromium                                             0.05\r\n\r\n   Lead                                                 0.05\r\n\r\n   Mercury                                              0.002\r\n\r\n   Selenium                                             0.01\r\n\r\n   Silver                                               0.05\r\n\r\n   Endrin               (1,2,3,4,10,10-hexachloro-1,\r\n                        7-epoxy-1,4,4a,5,6,7,8,\r\n                        9a-octahydro-1, 4-endo,\r\n                        endo-5,8-dimethano\r\n                        naphthalene)                    0.0002\r\n\r\n   Lindane              (1,2,3,4,5,6,-hexachlorocyclohexane,\r\n                        gamma isomer)                   0.004\r\n\r\n    Methoxychlor        (1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis\r\n                        (p-methoxyphenylethane)         0.1\r\n\r\n   Toxaphene            (C10H10C18, Technical\r\n                        chlorinated camphene,\r\n                        67-69 percent chlorine)         0.005\r\n\r\n   2,4-D                (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic\r\n                        acid)                           0.1\r\n\r\n   2,4,5-TP Silvex  (2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxypropionic\r\n                     acid)                              0.01\r\n\r\n     (1)Milligrams per liter\n(3) Shall not exceed an alternate limit established by the Executive Secretary under R315-8- 6.5(b).\n(b) The Executive Secretary will establish an alternate concentration limit for a hazardous constituent if they find that the constituent will not pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment as long as the alternate concentration limit is not exceeded. In establishing alternate concentration limits, the Executive Secretary will consider the following factors:\n(1) Potential adverse effects on groundwater quality, considering:\n(i) The physical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the regulated unit, including its potential for migration;\n(ii) The hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and surrounding land;\n(iii) The quantity of groundwater and the direction of groundwater flow;\n(iv) The proximity and withdrawal rates of groundwater users;\n(v) The current and future uses of groundwater in the area;\n(vi) The existing quality of groundwater, including other sources of contamination and their cumulative impact on the groundwater quality;\n(vii) The potential for health risks caused by human exposure to waste constituents;\n(viii) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents;\n(ix) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects; and\n(2) Potential adverse effects on hydraulically connected surface water quality, considering:\n(i) The volume and physical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the regulated unit;\n(ii) The hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and surrounding land;\n(iii) The quantity and quality of groundwater, and the direction of groundwater flow;\n(iv) The patterns of rainfall in the region;\n(v) The proximity of the regulated unit to surface waters;\n(vi) The current and future uses of surface waters in the area and any water quality standards established for those surface waters;\n(vii) The existing quality of surface water, including other sources of contamination and the cumulative impact on surface water quality;\n(viii) The potential for health risks caused by human exposure to waste constituents;\n(ix) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents; and\n(x) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects.\n(c) In making any determination under R315-8-6.5(b) about the use of groundwater in the area around the facility the Board will consider any identification of underground sources of drinking water.\n6.6 POINT OF COMPLIANCE\n(a) The Executive Secretary will specify in the facility permit the point of compliance at which the groundwater protection standard of R315-8-6.3 applies and at which monitoring shall be conducted. The point of compliance is a vertical surface located at the hydraulically downgradient limit of the waste management area that extends down into the uppermost aquifer underlaying the regulated units.\n(b) The waste management area is the limit projected in the horizontal plane of the area on which waste will be placed during the active life of a regulated unit.\n(1) The waste management area includes horizontal space taken up by any liner, dike, or other barrier designed to contain waste in a regulated unit.\n(2) If the facility contains more than one regulated unit, the waste management area is described by an imaginary line circumscribing the several regulated units.\n6.7 COMPLIANCE PERIOD\n(a) The Executive Secretary will specify in the facility permit the compliance period during which the groundwater protection standard of R315-8-6.3 applies. The compliance period is the number of years equal to the active life of the waste management area, including any waste management activity prior to permit and the closure period.\n(b) The compliance period begins when the owner or operator initiates a compliance monitoring program meeting the requirements of R315-8-6.9.\n(c) If the owner or operator is engaged in a corrective action program at the end of the compliance period specified in R315-8-6.7(a), the compliance period is extended until the owner or operator can demonstrate that the groundwater protection standard of R315-8-6.3 has not been exceeded for a period of three consecutive years.\n6.8 GENERAL GROUNDWATER MONITORING REQUIREMENTS\nThe owner or operator shall comply with the following requirements for any groundwater monitoring program developed to satisfy R315-8-6.9, R315-8-6.10, or R315-8-6.11:\n(a) The groundwater monitoring system shall consist of a sufficient number of wells, installed at appropriate locations and depths to yield groundwater samples from the uppermost aquifer that:\n(1) Represent the quality of background water that has not been affected by leakage from a regulated unit;\n(i) A determination of background quality may include sampling of wells that are not hydraulically upgradient of the waste management area where:\n(A) hydrogeologic conditions do not allow the owner or operator to determine what wells are hydraulically upgradient; and\n(B) Sampling at other wells will provide an indication of background groundwater quality that is representative or more representative than that provided by the upgradient wells;\n(2) represent the quality of groundwater passing the point of compliance; and\n(3) allow for the detection of contamination when hazardous waste or hazardous constituents have migrated from the waste management area to the uppermost aquifer.\n(b) If a facility contains more than one regulated unit, separate groundwater monitoring systems are not required for each regulated unit provided that provisions for sampling the groundwater in the uppermost aquifer will enable detection and measurement at the compliance point of hazardous constituents from the regulated units that have entered the groundwater in the uppermost aquifer.\n(c) All monitoring wells shall be cased in a manner that maintains the integrity of the monitoring well bore hole. This casing shall be screened or perforated and packed with gravel or sand, where necessary, to enable collection of groundwater samples. The annular space, i.e., the space between the bore hole and well casing, above the sampling depth shall be sealed to prevent contamination of samples and the groundwater.\n(d) The groundwater monitoring program shall include consistent sampling and analysis procedures that are designed to ensure monitoring results that provide a reliable indication of groundwater quality below the waste management area. At a minimum the program shall include procedures and techniques for:\n(1) Sample collection;\n(2) Sample preservation and shipment;\n(3) Analytical procedures; and\n(4) Chain of custody control.\n(e) The groundwater monitoring program shall include sampling and analytical methods that are appropriate for groundwater sampling and that accurately measure hazardous constituents in groundwater samples.\n(f) The groundwater monitoring program shall include a determination of the groundwater surface elevation each time groundwater is sampled.\n(g) In detection monitoring or where appropriate in compliance monitoring, data on each hazardous constituent specified in the permit will be collected from background wells and wells at the compliance point. The number and kinds of samples collected to establish background shall be appropriate for the form of statistical test employed, following generally accepted statistical principles. The sample size should be as large as necessary to ensure with reasonable confidence that a contaminant release to groundwater from a facility will be detected. The owner or operator will determine an appropriate sampling procedure and interval for each hazardous constituent listed in the facility permit which shall be specified in the unit permit upon approval by the Executive Secretary. This sampling procedure should be:\n(1) a sequence of at least four samples, taken at an interval that assures, to the greatest extent technically feasible, that an independent sample is obtained, by reference to the uppermost aquifer's effective porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and hydraulic gradient, and the fate and transport characteristics of the potential contaminants; or\n(2) an alternate sampling procedure proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Executive Secretary.\n(h) The owner or operator will specify one of the following statistical methods to be used in evaluating groundwater monitoring data for each hazardous constituent, upon approval by the Executive Secretary, will be specified in the unit permit. The statistical test chosen shall be conducted separately for each hazardous constituent in each well. Where practical quantification limits, pql's, are used in any of the following statistical procedures to comply with R315-8-6.8(i)(5), the pql shall be proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Executive Secretary. Use of any of the following statistical methods shall be protective of human health and the environment and shall comply with the performance standards outlined in R315-8-6.8(i).\n(1) a parametric analysis of variance, ANOVA, followed by multiple comparisons procedures to identify statistical significant evidence of contamination. The method shall include estimation and testing of the contrasts between each compliance well's mean and the background mean levels for each constituent;\n(2) an analysis of variance, ANOVA, based on ranks followed by multiple comparisons procedures to identify statistical significant evidence of contamination. The method shall include estimation and testing of the contrasts between compliance well's median and the background median levels for each constituent;\n(3) a tolerance or prediction interval procedure in which an interval for each constituent is established from the distribution of the background data, and the level of each constituent in each compliance well is compared to the upper tolerance or prediction limit;\n(4) a control chart approach that gives control limits for each constituent;\n(5) another statistical test method submitted by the owner or operator and approved by the Executive Secretary.\n(i) Any statistical method chosen under R315-8-6.8(h) for specification in the unit permit shall comply with the following performance standards, as appropriate:\n(1) The statistical method used to evaluate groundwater monitoring data shall be appropriate for the distribution of chemical parameters or hazardous constituents. If the distribution of the chemical parameters or hazardous constituents is shown by the owner or operator to be inappropriate for a normal theory test, then the data should be transformed or a distribution-free theory test should be used. If the distributions for the constituents differ, more than one statistical method may be needed.\n(2) If an individual well comparison procedure is used to compare an individual compliance well constituent concentration with background constituent concentrations or a groundwater protection standard, the test shall be done at a Type I error level no less than 0.01 for each testing period. If a multiple comparisons procedure is used, the Type I experimentwise error rate for each testing period shall be no less than 0.05; however, the Type I error of no less than 0.01 for individual well comparisons shall be maintained. This performance standard does not apply to tolerance intervals, predictions intervals or control charts.\n(3) If a control chart approach is used to evaluate groundwater monitoring data, the specific type of control chart and its associated parameter values shall be proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Executive Secretary if he finds it to be protective of human health and the environment.\n(4) If a tolerance interval or a prediction interval is used to evaluate groundwater monitoring data, the levels of confidence and, for tolerance intervals, the percentage of the population that the interval shall contain, shall be proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Executive Secretary if he finds these parameters to be protective of human health and the environment. These parameters will be determined after considering the number of samples in the background data base, the data distribution, and the range of the concentration values for each constituent of concern.\n(5) The statistical method shall account for data below the limit of detection with one or more statistical procedures that are protective of human health and the environment. Any practical quantification limit, pql, approved by the Executive Secretary under R315-8-6.8(h) that is used in the statistical method shall be the lowest concentration level that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions that are available to the facility.\n(6) If necessary, the statistical method shall include procedures to control or correct for seasonal and spatial variability as well as temporal correlation in the data.\n(j) Groundwater monitoring data collected in accordance with R315-8-6.8(g) including actual levels of constituents shall be maintained in the facility operating record. The Executive Secretary will specify in the permit when the data shall be submitted for review.\n6.9 DETECTION MONITORING PROGRAM\nAn owner or operator required to establish a detection monitoring program under this section shall, at a minimum, discharge the following responsibilities:\n(a) The owner or operator shall monitor for indicator parameters, e.g., specific conductance, pH, total organic carbon, or total organic halogen, waste constituents, or reaction products that provide a reliable indication of the presence of hazardous constituents in groundwater. The Executive Secretary will specify the parameters or constituents to be monitored in the facility permit after considering the following factors:\n(1) The types, quantities, and concentrations of constituents in wastes managed at the regulated unit;\n(2) The mobility, stability, and persistence of waste constituents or their reaction products in the unsaturated zone beneath the waste management area;\n(3) The detectability of indicator parameters, waste constituents, and reaction products in groundwater; and\n(4) The concentrations or values and coefficients of variation of proposed monitoring parameters or constituents in the groundwater background.\n(b) The owner or operator shall install a groundwater monitoring system at the compliance point as specified under R315-8-6.6. The groundwater monitoring system shall comply with R315-8-6.8(a)(2), (b), and (c).\n(c) The owner or operator shall conduct a groundwater monitoring program for each chemical parameter and hazardous constituent specified in the permit pursuant to R315-8-6.9(a) in accordance with R315-8-6.9(g). The owner or operator shall maintain a record of groundwater analytical data as measured and in a form necessary for the determination of statistical significance under R315-8-6.8(h).\n(d) The Executive Secretary will specify the frequencies for collecting samples and conducting statistical tests to determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of contamination for any parameter or hazardous constituent specified in the permit under R315-8-6.9(a) in accordance with R315-8-6.8(g). A sequence of at least four samples from each well, background and compliance wells, shall be collected at least semiannually during detection monitoring.\n(e) The owner or operator shall determine the groundwater flow rate and direction in the uppermost aquifer at least annually.\n(f) The owner or operator shall determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of contamination for any chemical parameter of hazardous constituent specified in the permit pursuant to R315-8-6.9(a) at a frequency specified under R315-8-6.9(d).\n(1) In determining whether statistically significant evidence of contamination exists, the owner or operator shall use the method specified in the permit under R315-8-6.8(h). This method shall compare data collected at the compliance point to the background groundwater quality data.\n(2) The owner or operator shall determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of contamination at each monitoring well as the compliance point within a reasonable period of time after completion of sampling. The Executive Secretary will specify in the facility permit what period of time is reasonable, after considering the complexity of the statistical test and the availability of laboratory facilities to perform the analysis of groundwater samples.\n(g) If the owner or operator determines pursuant to R315-8-6.9(f) that there is statistically significant evidence of contamination for chemical parameters of hazardous constituents specified pursuant to R315-8-6.9(a) at any monitoring well at the compliance point, he shall:\n(1) notify the Executive Secretary of this finding in writing within seven days. The notification shall indicate what chemical parameters or hazardous constituents have shown statistically significant evidence of contamination;\n(2) immediately sample the groundwater in all monitoring wells and determine whether constituents in the list of R315-50-14, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264, Appendix IX, are present, and if so, in what concentration;\n(3) for any R315-50-14, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264, Appendix IX, compounds found in the analysis pursuant to R315-8-6.9(g)(2), the owner or operator may resample within one month and repeat the analysis for these compounds detected. If the results for the second analysis confirm the initial results, then these constituents will form the basis for compliance monitoring. If the owner or operator does not resample for the compounds found pursuant to R315-8-6.9(g)(2), the hazardous constituents found during this initial R315-50-14, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264, Appendix IX, analysis will form the basis for compliance monitoring;\n(4) within 90 days, submit to the Executive Secretary an application for a permit modification to establish a compliance monitoring program meeting the requirements of R315-8-6.10. The application shall include the following information;\n(i) an identification of the concentration of any R315-50-14, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264, Appendix IX, constituent detected in the groundwater at each monitoring well at the compliance point;\n(ii) any proposed changes to the groundwater monitoring system at the facility necessary to meet the requirements of R315-8-6.10;\n(iii) any proposed additions or changes to the monitoring frequency, sampling and analysis procedures or methods, or statistical methods used at the facility necessary to meet the requirements of R315-8-6.10;\n(iv) for each hazardous constituent detected at the compliance point, a proposed concentration limit under R315-8-6.10(a)(1) or (2), or a notice of intent to seek an alternate concentration limit under R315-8-6.5(b); and\n(5) within 180 days, submit to the Executive Secretary:\n(i) all data necessary to justify an alternate concentration limit sought under R315-8-6.5(b); and\n(ii) an engineering feasibility plan for a corrective action program necessary to meet the requirement of R315-8-6.11, unless:\n(A) all hazardous constituents identified under R315-8-6.9(g)(2) are listed in R315-8-6.5, Table 1 and their concentrations do not exceed their respective values given in that table; or\n(B) the owner or operator has sought an alternate concentration limit under R315-8-6.5(b) for every hazardous constituent identified under R315-8-6.9(g)(2).\n(6) If the owner or operator determines, pursuant to R315-8-6.9(f), that there is a statistically significant difference for chemical parameters or hazardous constituents specified pursuant to R315-8-6.9(a) at any monitoring well at the compliance point, he may demonstrate that a source other than a regulated unit caused the contamination or that the detection is an artifact caused by an error in sampling, analysis, or statistical evaluation or natural variation in the groundwater. The owner or operator may make a demonstration under R315-8-6.9(g)(6) in addition to, or in lieu of, submitting a permit modification application under R315-8-6.9(g)(4); however, the owner or operator is not relieved of the requirement to submit a permit modification application within the time specified in R315-8-6.9(g)(4) unless the demonstration made under R315-8-6.9(g)(6) successfully shows that a source other than the regulated unit caused the increase, or that the increase resulted from error in sampling, analysis, or evaluation. In making a demonstration under R315-8-6.9(g)(6), the owner or operator shall:\n(i) notify the Executive Secretary in writing within seven days of determining statistically significant evidence of contamination at the compliance point that he intends to make a demonstration under this paragraph;\n(ii) within 90 days, submit a report to the Executive Secretary which demonstrates that a source other than a regulated unit caused the contamination or that the contamination resulted from error in sampling, analysis, or evaluation;\n(iii) within 90 days, submit to the Executive Secretary an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes to the detection monitoring program facility; and\n(iv) continue to monitor in accordance with the detection monitoring program established under R315- 8-6.9.\n(h) If the owner or operator determines that the detection monitoring program no longer satisfies the requirements of this section, he shall, within 90 days, submit an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes to the program.\n6.10 COMPLIANCE MONITORING PROGRAM\nAn owner or operator required to establish a compliance monitoring program under this section shall, at a minimum, discharge the following responsibilities:\n(a) The owner or operator shall monitor the groundwater to determine whether regulated units are in compliance with the groundwater protection standard under R315-8-6.3. The Executive Secretary will specify the groundwater protection standard in the facility permit including:\n(1) A list of the hazardous constituents identified under R315-8-6.4;\n(2) Concentration limits under R315-8-6.5 for each of those hazardous constituents;\n(3) The compliance point under R315-8-6.6;\n(4) The compliance period under R315-8-6.7.\n(b) The owner or operator shall install a groundwater monitoring system at the compliance point as specified under R315-8-6.6. The groundwater monitoring system shall comply with R315-8-6.8(a)(2), (b) and (c).\n(c) The Executive Secretary will specify the sampling procedures and statistical methods appropriate for the constituents and the facility, consistent with R315-8-6.8(g) and (h).\n(1) The owner or operator shall conduct a sampling program for each chemical parameter or hazardous waste constituent in accordance with R315-8-6.8(g).\n(2) The owner or operator shall record groundwater analytical data as measured and in form necessary for the determination of statistical significance under R315-8-6.8(h) for the compliance period of the facility.\n(d) The owner or operator shall determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of increased contamination for any chemical parameter or hazardous constituent specified in the permit, pursuant to R315-8- 6.10(a), at a frequency specified under R315-8-6.10(f).\n(1) In determining whether statistically significant evidence of increased contamination exists, the owner or operator shall use the method specified in the permit under R315-8-6.5. The method shall compare data collected at the compliance point to a concentration limit developed in accordance with R315-8-6.8(h).\n(2) The owner or operator shall determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of increase contamination at each monitoring well at the compliance point within a reasonable time period after completion of sampling. The Executive Secretary will specify that time period in the facility permit, after considering the complexity of the statistical test and the availability of laboratory facilities to perform the analysis of groundwater samples.\n(e) The owner or operator shall determine the groundwater flow rate and direction in the uppermost aquifer at least annually.\n(f) The Executive Secretary will specify the frequencies for collecting samples and conducting statistical tests to determine statistically significant evidence of increased contamination in accordance with R315-8- 6.8(g).\n(g) The owner or operator shall analyze samples from all monitoring wells at the compliance point for all constituents contained in R315-50-14, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR, Appendix IX, at least annually to determine whether additional hazardous constituents are present in the uppermost aquifer and, if so, at what concentration, pursuant to procedures in R315-8-6.9(f). If the owner or operator finds R315-50-14, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264, Appendix IX, constituents in the groundwater that are not already identified in the permit as monitoring constituents, the owner or operator may resample within one month and repeat the R315-50-14, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264, Appendix IX, analysis. If the second analysis confirms the presence of new constituents, the owner or operator shall report the concentration of these additional constituents to the Executive Secretary within seven days after the completion of the second analysis and add them to the monitoring list. If the owner or operator chooses not to resample, then he shall report the concentrations of these additional constituents to the Executive Secretary within seven days after completion of the initial analysis and add them to the monitoring list.\n(h) If the owner or operator determines pursuant to R315-8-6.10(d) that any concentration limits under R315-8-6.5 are being exceeded at any monitoring well at the point of compliance he shall:\n(1) Notify the Executive Secretary of this finding in writing within seven days. The notification shall indicate which concentration limits have been exceeded;\n(2) Submit to the Executive Secretary an application for a permit modification to establish a corrective action program meeting the requirements of R315-8-6.11, within 180 days, or within 90 days if an engineering feasibility study has been previously submitted to the Executive Secretary under R315-8-6.9(h)(5). The application shall at a minimum include the following information:\n(i) A detailed description of corrective actions that will achieve compliance with the groundwater protection standard specified in the permit under R315-8-6.10(a); and\n(ii) A plan for a groundwater monitoring program that will demonstrate the effectiveness of the corrective action. The groundwater monitoring program may be based on a compliance monitoring program developed to meet the requirements of this section.\n(i) If the owner or operator determines, pursuant to R315-8-6.10(d), that the groundwater concentration limits under R315-8-6.10 are being exceeded at any monitoring well at the point of compliance, he may demonstrate that a source other than a regulated unit caused the contamination or that the detection is an artifact caused by an error in sampling, analysis, or statistical evaluation or natural variation in the groundwater. In making a demonstration under R315-8-6.10(i), the owner or operator shall:\n(1) Notify the Executive Secretary in writing within seven days that he intends to make a demonstration under R315-8-6.10(i);\n(2) Within 90 days, submit a report to the Executive Secretary which demonstrates that a source other than a regulated unit caused the standard to be exceeded or that the apparent noncompliance with the standards resulted from error in sampling, analysis, or evaluation;\n(3) Within 90 days, submit to the Executive Secretary an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes to the compliance monitoring program at the facility; and\n(4) Continue to monitor in accord with the compliance monitoring program established under this section.\n(j) If the owner or operator determines that the compliance monitoring program no longer satisfies the requirements of this section, he shall within 90 days, submit an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes to the program.\n6.11 CORRECTIVE ACTION PROGRAM\nAn owner or operator required to establish a corrective action program under this section shall, at a minimum, discharge the following responsibilities:\n(a) The owner or operator shall take corrective action to ensure that regulated units are in compliance with the groundwater protection standard under R315-8-6.3. The Executive Secretary will specify the groundwater protection standard in the facility permit, including:\n(1) A list of hazardous constituents identified under R315-8-6.4;\n(2) Concentration limits under R315-8-6.5 for each of those hazardous constituents;\n(3) The compliance point under R315-8-6.6; and\n(4) The compliance period under R315-8-6.7.\n(b) The owner or operator shall implement a corrective action program that prevents hazardous constituents from exceeding their respective concentration limits at the compliance point by removing the hazardous waste constituents or treating them in place. The permit will specify the specific measures that will be taken.\n(c) The owner or operator shall begin corrective action within a reasonable time period after the groundwater protection standard is exceeded. The Executive Secretary will specify that time period in the facility permit. If a facility permit includes a corrective action program in addition to a compliance monitoring program, the permit will specify when the corrective action will begin and the requirement will operate in lieu of R315-8-6.10(i)(2).\n(d) In conjunction with a corrective action program, the owner or operator shall establish and implement a groundwater monitoring program to demonstrate the effectiveness of the corrective action program. The monitoring program may be based on the requirements for a compliance monitoring program under R315-8-6.10 and shall be as effective as that program in determining compliance with the groundwater protection standard under R315-8-6.3 and in determining the success of a corrective action program under R315-8-6.11(e), where appropriate.\n(e) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the owner or operator shall conduct a corrective action program to remove or treat in place any hazardous constituents under R315-8-6.4 that exceed concentration limits under R315-8-6.5 in groundwater:\n(1) between the compliance point under R315-8-6.6 and the downgradient facility property boundary; and\n(2) beyond the facility boundary, where necessary to protect human health and the environment, unless the owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Executive Secretary that, despite the owner's or operator's best efforts, the owner or operator was unable to obtain the necessary permission to undertake the action. The owner or operator is not relieved of all responsibility to clean up a release that has migrated beyond the facility boundary where off-site access is denied. On-site measures to address the releases will be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n(3) Corrective action measures under R315-8-6.11(e) shall be initiated and completed within a reasonable period of time considering the extent of contamination.\n(4) Corrective action measures under this paragraph may be terminated once the concentration of hazardous constituents under R315-8-6.4 is reduced to levels below their respective concentration limits under R315-8- 6.5.\n(f) The owner or operator shall continue corrective action measures during the compliance period to the extent necessary to ensure that the groundwater protection standard is not exceeded. If the owner or operator is conducting corrective action at the end of the compliance period, he shall continue that corrective action for as long as necessary to achieve compliance with the groundwater protection standard. The owner or operator may terminate corrective action measures taken beyond the period equal to the active life of the waste management area, including the closure period if he can demonstrate, based on data from the groundwater monitoring program under R315-8-6.11(d), that the groundwater protection standard of R315-8-6.3 has not been exceeded for a period of three consecutive years.\n(g) The owner or operator shall report in writing to the Executive Secretary on the effectiveness of the corrective action program. The owner or operator shall submit these reports semi-annually.\n(h) If the owner or operator determines that the corrective action program no longer satisfies the requirements of this section, he shall within 90 days, submit an application for a permit modification to the program.\n6.12 CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT UNITS\n(a) The owner or operator of a facility seeking a permit for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste shall institute corrective action as necessary to protect human health and the environment for all releases of hazardous waste or constituents from any solid waste management unit at the facility, regardless of the time at which waste was placed in the unit.\n(b) Corrective action will be specified in the permit in accordance with R315-8-6-12 and R315-8-21, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264.552 and 264.553. The permit will contain schedules of compliance for the corrective action, where such corrective action cannot be completed prior to issuance of the permit, and assurances of financial responsibility for completing the corrective action.\n(c) The owner or operator shall implement corrective actions beyond the facility property boundary, where necessary to protect human health and the environment, unless the owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Executive Secretary that, despite the owner's or operator's best efforts, the owner or operator was unable to obtain the necessary permission to undertake the actions. The owner or operator is not relieved of all responsibility to clean up a release that has migrated beyond the facility boundary where off-site access is denied. On-site measures to address the releases will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Assurances of financial responsibility for corrective action shall be provided.\n(d) This does not apply to remediation waste management sites unless they are part of a facility subject to a permit for treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous wastes that are not remediation wastes.\nThe requirements as found in 40 CFR subpart G, 264.110 - 264.120, 1998 ed., as amended by 63 FR 56710, October 22, 1998, are incorporated by reference with the following exceptions:\n(a) substitute \"Executive Secretary\" for all references made to \"Regional Administrator\".\n(b) substitute R315-3 for all general reference made to 40 CFR 124 and 270.\n(c) substitute \"The Utah Solid and Hazardous Waste Act\" for all references made to the \"Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\" or \"RCRA.\"\nThe requirements as found in 40 CFR subpart H, 264.140 - 264.151, 1998 ed., as amended by 63 FR 56710, October 22, 1998, are incorporated by reference with the following exceptions:\n(a) substitute \"Executive Secretary\" for all references to \"Administrator\" or \"Regional Administrator\".\n(b) substitute \"Board\" for all references to \"Agency\" or \"EPA.\"\n(c) substitute \"The Utah Solid and Hazardous Waste Act\" for all references to the \"Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\" or \"RCRA.\"\nR315-8-9.

Surface Impoundments.\n11.1 APPLICABILITY\nThe rules in this section apply to owners and operators of facilities that use surface impoundments to treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste except as provided otherwise in R315-8-1.\n11.2 DESIGN AND OPERATING REQUIREMENTS\n(a) Any surface impoundment that is not covered by R315-8-11.2(f) or R315-7-18.9 shall have a liner for all portions of the impoundment, except for existing portions of such impoundments. The liner shall be designed, constructed, and installed to prevent any migration of wastes out of the impoundment to the adjacent subsurface soil or groundwater or surface water at any time during the active life, including the closure period, of the impoundment. The liner may be constructed of materials that may allow wastes to migrate into the liner, but not into the adjacent subsurface soil or groundwater or surface water, during the active life of the facility, provided that the impoundment is closed in accordance with R315-8-11.5(a)(1). For impoundments that will be closed in accordance with R315-8-11.5(a)(2), the liner shall be constructed of materials that can prevent wastes from migrating into the liner during the active life of the facility. The liner shall be:\n(1) Constructed of materials that have appropriate chemical properties and sufficient strength and thickness to prevent failure due to pressure gradients, including static head and external hydrogeologic forces, physical contact with the waste or leachate to which they are exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of installation, and the stress of daily operation;\n(2) Placed upon a foundation or base capable of providing support to the liner and resistance to pressure gradients above and below the liner to prevent failure of the liner due to settlement, compression, or uplift; and\n(3) Installed to cover all surrounding earth likely to be in contact with the waste or leachate.\n(b) The owner or operator will be exempted from the requirements of R315-8-11.2(a) if the Executive Secretary finds, based on a demonstration by the owner or operator, that alternate design and operating practices, together with location characteristics, will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituents, see R315-8-6.4, into the groundwater or surface water at any future time. In deciding whether to grant an exemption, the Executive Secretary will consider:\n(1) The nature and quantity of the wastes;\n(2) The proposed alternate design and operation;\n(3) The hydrogeologic setting of the facility, including the attenuative capacity and thickness of the liners and soils present between the impoundment and groundwater or surface water; and\n(4) All other factors which would influence the quality and mobility of the leachate produced and the potential for it to migrate to groundwater or surface water.\n(c) The owner or operator of each new surface impoundment unit on which construction commences after January 29, 1992, each lateral expansion of a surface impoundment unit on which construction commences after July 29, 1992 and each replacement of an existing surface impoundment unit that is to commence reuse after July 29, 1992 shall install two or more liners and a leachate collection and removal system between such liners. \"Construction commences\" is as defined in R315-1-1(b), which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 260.10, under \"existing facility\".\n(1)(i) The liner system shall include:\n(A) A top liner designed and constructed of materials, e.g., a geomembrane, to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into such liner during the active life and post-closure care period; and\n(B) A composite bottom liner, consisting of at least two components. The upper component shall be designed and constructed of materials, e.g., a geomembrane, to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into this component during the active life and post-closure care period. The lower component shall be designed and constructed of materials to minimize the migration of hazardous constituents if a breach in the upper component were to occur. The lower component shall be constructed of at least three feet, 91 cm, of compacted soil material with a hydraulic conductivity of no more than 1 x 10/-7/cm/sec.\n(ii) The liners shall comply with R315-8-11.2(a)(1)-(3).\n(2) The leachate collection and removal system between the liners, and immediately above the bottom composite liner in the case of multiple leachate collection and removal systems, is also a leak detection system. This leak detection system shall be capable of detecting, collecting, and removing leaks of hazardous constituents at the earliest practicable time through all areas of the top liner likely to be exposed to waste or leachate during the active life and post-closure care period. The requirements for a leak detection system in this paragraph are satisfied by installation of a system that is, at a minimum:\n(i) Constructed with a bottom slope of one percent or more;\n(ii) Constructed of granular drainage materials with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 x 10/- 1/cm/sec or more and a thickness of 12 inches, 30.5 cm, or more; or constructed of synthetic or geonet drainage materials with a transmissivity of 3 x 10/-4/m2sec or more;\n(iii) Constructed of materials that are chemically resistant to the waste managed in the surface impoundment and the leachate expected to be generated, and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressures exerted by overlying wastes and any waste cover materials or equipment used at the surface impoundment;\n(iv) Designed and operated to minimize clogging during the active life and post-closure care period; and\n(v) Constructed with sumps and liquid removal methods, e.g., pumps, of sufficient size to collect and remove liquids from the sump and prevent liquids from backing up into the drainage layer. Each unit shall have its own sump(s). The design of each sump and removal system shall provide a method for measuring and recording the volume of liquids present in the sump and of liquids removed.\n(3) The owner or operator shall collect and remove pumpable liquids in the sumps to minimize the head on the bottom liner.\n(4) The owner or operator of a leak detection system that is not located completely above the seasonal high water table shall demonstrate that the operation of the leak detection system will not be adversely affected by the presence of ground water.\n(d) The Executive Secretary may approve alternative design or operating practices to those specified in R315-8-11.2(c) if the owner or operator demonstrates to the Executive Secretary that such design and operating practices, together with location characteristics:\n(1) Will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituent into the groundwater or surface water at least as effectively as the liners and leachate collection and removal system specified in R315-8-11.2(c); and\n(2) Will allow detection of leaks of hazardous constituents through the top liner at least as effectively.\n(e) The double liner requirement set forth in R315-8-11.2(f) may be waived by the Executive Secretary for any monofill, if:\n(1) The monofill contains only hazardous wastes from foundry furnace emission controls or metal casting molding sand, and the wastes do not contain constituents which would render the wastes hazardous for reasons other than the EP toxicity characteristics, and\n(2)(i)(A) The monofill has at least one liner for which there is no evidence that the liner is leaking. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term \"liner\" means a liner designed, constructed, installed and operated to prevent hazardous waste from passing into the liner at any time during the active life of the facility, or a liner designed, constructed, installed, and operated to prevent hazardous waste from migrating beyond the liner to adjacent subsurface soil, groundwater, or surface water at any time during the active life of the facility. In the case of any surface impoundment which has been exempted from the requirements of R315-8-11.2(c) on the basis of a liner designed, constructed, installed, and operated to prevent hazardous waste from passing beyond the liner, at the closure of the impoundment, the owner or operator shall remove or decontaminate all waste residues, all contaminated liner material, and contaminated soil to the extent practicable given the specific site conditions and the nature and extent of contamination. If all contaminated soil is not removed or decontaminated, the owner or operator of the impoundment will comply with appropriate post-closure requirements, including but not limited to groundwater monitoring and corrective action:\n(B) The monofill is located more than one-quarter mile from an underground source of drinking water, as that term is defined in 40 CFR 144.3; and\n(C) The monofill is in compliance with generally applicable groundwater monitoring requirements for facilities with a permit; or\n(ii) The owner or operator demonstrates that the monofill is located, designed and operated so as to assure that there will be no migration of any hazardous constituent into groundwater or surface water at any future time.\n(f) The owner or operator of any replacement surface impoundment unit is exempt from R315-8-11.2(c) if:\n(1) The existing unit was constructed in compliance with the design standards of sections 3004 (o)(1)(A)(i) and (o)(5) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and\n(2) There is no reason to believe that the liner is not functioning as designed.\n(g) A surface impoundment shall be designed, constructed, maintained, and operated to prevent overtopping resulting from normal or abnormal operations; overfilling; wind and wave action; rainfall; run-on; malfunctions of level controllers, alarms, and other equipment; and human error.\n(h) A surface impoundment shall have dikes that are designed, constructed, and maintained with sufficient structural integrity to prevent massive failure to the dikes. In ensuring structural integrity, it shall not be presumed that the liner system will function without leakage during the active life of the unit.\n(i) The Executive Secretary will specify in the permit all design and operating practices that are necessary to ensure that the requirements of this section are satisfied.\n11.3 MONITORING AND INSPECTION\n(a) During construction and installation, liners, except in the case of existing portions of surface impoundments exempt from R315-8-11.2(a), and cover systems, e.g., membranes, sheets, or coatings, shall be inspected for uniformity, damage, and imperfections (e.g., holes, cracks, thin spots, or foreign materials). Immediately after construction or installation:\n(1) Synthetic liners and covers shall be inspected to ensure tight seams and joints and the absence of tears, punctures, or blisters; and\n(2) Soil-based and admixed liners and covers shall be inspected for imperfections including lenses, cracks, channels, root holes, or other structural non-uniformities that may cause an increase in the permeability of the liner or cover.\n(b) While a surface impoundment is in operation, it shall be inspected weekly and after storms to detect evidence of any of the following:\n(1) Deterioration, malfunctions, or improper operation of overtopping control systems;\n(2) Sudden drops in the level of the impoundment's contents; and\n(3) Severe erosion or other signs of deterioration in dikes or other containment devices.\n(c) Prior to the issuance of a permit and after any extended period of time, at least six months, during which the impoundment was not in service, the owner or operator shall obtain a certification from a qualified engineer that the impoundment's dike, including that portion of any dike which provides freeboard, has structural integrity. The certification shall establish, in particular, that the dike:\n(1) Will withstand the stress of the pressure exerted by the types and amounts of wastes to be placed in the impoundment; and\n(2) Will not fail due to scouring or piping, without dependence on any liner system included in the surface impoundment construction.\n(d)(1) An owner or operator required to have a leak detection system under R315-8-11.2(c) or (d) shall record the amount of liquids removed from each leak detection system sump at least once each week during the active life and closure period.\n(2) After the final cover is installed, the amount of liquids removed from each leak detection system sump shall be recorded at least monthly. If the liquid level in the sump stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive months, the amount of liquids in the sumps shall be recorded at least quarterly.

The hazardous constituents to be monitored are those specified under R315-8-13.2(b).\n(2) The Executive Secretary may require monitoring for principal hazardous constituents (PHCs) in lieu of the constituents specified under R315-8-13.2(b). PHCs are hazardous constituents contained in the wastes to be applied at the unit that are the most difficult to treat, considering the combined effects of degradation, transformation, and immobilization. The Board will establish PHCs if they find, based on the waste analyses, treatment demonstrations, or other data, that effective degradation, transformation, or immobilization of the PHCs will assure treatment to at least equivalent levels for the other hazardous constituents in the waste.\n(b) The owner or operator shall install an unsaturated zone monitoring system that includes soil monitoring using soil cores and soil-pore liquid monitoring using devices such as lysimeters. The unsaturated zone monitoring system shall consist of a sufficient number of sampling points at appropriate locations and depths to yield samples that;\n(1) Represent the quality of background soil-pore liquid and the chemical make-up of soil that has not been affected by leakage from the treatment zone; and\n(2) Indicate the quality of soil-pore liquid and the chemical make-up of the soil below the treatment zone.\n(c) The owner or operator shall establish a background value for each hazardous constituent to be monitored under R315-8-13.6(a). The permit will specify the background values for each constituent or specify the procedures to be used to calculate the background values.\n(1) Background soil values may be based on a one-time sampling at a background plot having characteristics similar to those of the treatment zone.\n(2) Background soil-pore liquid values shall be based on at least quarterly sampling for one year at a background plot having characteristics similar to those of the treatment zone.\n(3) The owner or operator shall express all background values in a form necessary for the determination of statistically significant increases under R315-8-13.6(f).\n(4) In taking samples used in the determination of all background values, the owner or operator shall use an unsaturated zone monitoring system that complies with R315-8-13.6(b)(1).\n(d) The owner or operator shall conduct soil monitoring and soil-pore liquid monitoring immediately below the treatment zone.

The owner or operator shall express the results of soil and soil-pore liquid monitoring in a form necessary for the determination of statistically significant increases under R315-8-13.6(f).\n(e) The owner or operator shall use consistent sampling and analysis procedures that are designed to ensure sampling results that provide a reliable indication of soil-pore liquid quality and the chemical make-up of the soil below the treatment zone. At a minimum, the owner or operator shall implement procedures and techniques for:\n(1) Sample collection;\n(2) Sample preservation and shipment;\n(3) Analytical procedures; and\n(4) Chain of custody control.\n(f) The owner or operator shall determine whether there is a statistically significant change over background values for any hazardous constituent to be monitored under R315-8-13.6(a) below the treatment zone each time he conducts soil monitoring and soil-pore liquid monitoring under R315-8-13.6(d).\n(1) In determining whether a statistically significant increase has occurred, the owner or operator shall compare the value of each constituent, as determined under R315-8-13.6(d), to the background value for that constituent according to the statistical procedure specified in the facility plan under this paragraph.\n(2) The owner or operator shall determine whether there has been a statistically significant increase below the treatment zone within a reasonable time period after completion of sampling. The Executive Secretary will specify that time period in the facility plan after considering the complexity of the statistical test and the availability of laboratory facilities to perform the analysis of soil and soil-pore liquid samples.\n(3) The owner or operator shall determine whether there is a statistically significant increase below the treatment zone using a statistical procedure that provides reasonable confidence that migration from the treatment zone will be identified. The Executive Secretary will specify a statistical procedure in the facility plan that he finds:\n(i) Is appropriate for the distribution of the data used to establish background values; and\n(ii) Provides a reasonable balance between the probability of falsely identifying migration from the treatment zone and the probability of failing to identify real migration from the treatment zone.\n(g) If the owner or operator determines, pursuant to R315-8-13.6(f), that there is a statistically significant increase of hazardous constituents below the treatment zone he shall:\n(1) Notify the Board of this finding in writing within seven days. The notification shall indicate what constituents have shown statistically significant increases.\n(2) Within 90 days, submit to the Executive Secretary an application for permit modification to modify the operating practices at the facility in order to maximize the success of degradation, transformation, or immobilization processes in the treatment zone.\n(h) If the owner or operator determines, pursuant to R315-8-13.6(f), that there is a statistically significant increase of hazardous constituents below the treatment zone, he may demonstrate that a source other than regulated units caused the increase or that the increase resulted from an error in sampling, analysis or evaluation. While the owner or operator may make a demonstration under this paragraph in addition to, or in lieu of, submitting a permit modification application under R315-8-13.6(g)(2), he is not relieved of the requirement to submit a plan modification application within the time specified in R315-8-13.6(g)(2) unless the demonstration made under this paragraph successfully shows that a source other than regulated units caused the increase or that the increase resulted from an error in sampling, analysis, or evaluation. In making a demonstration under this paragraph, the owner or operator shall:\n(1) Notify the Board or its duly authorized representative in writing within seven days of determining a statistically significant increase below the treatment zone that he intends to make a determination under this paragraph;\n(2) Within 90 days, submit a report to the Board demonstrating that a source other than the regulated units caused the increase or that the increase resulted from error in sampling, analysis, or evaluation;\n(3) Within 90 days, submit to the Executive Secretary an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes to the unsaturated zone monitoring program at the facility; and\n(4) Continue to monitor in accordance with the unsaturated zone monitoring program established under this section.\n13.7 RECORDKEEPING\nThe owner or operator shall include hazardous waste application dates, rates, and amounts in the operating record required under R315-8-5.3, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264.73.\n13.8 CLOSURE AND POST-CLOSURE CARE\n(a) During the closure period the owner or operator shall:\n(1) Continue all operations, including pH control, necessary to maximize degradation, transformation, or immobilization of hazardous constituents within the treatment zone as required under R315-8-13.4(a), except to the extent such measures are inconsistent with R315-8-13.8(a)(8);\n(2) Continue all operations in the treatment zone to minimize run-off of hazardous constituents as required under R315-8-13.4(b);\n(3) Maintain the run-on control system required under R315-8-13.4(c);\n(4) Maintain the run-off management system required under R315-8-13.4(d);\n(5) Control wind dispersal of hazardous waste if required under R315-8-13.4(f);\n(6) Continue to comply with any prohibitions or conditions concerning growth of food-chain crops under R315-8-13.5;\n(7) Continue unsaturated zone monitoring in compliance with R315-8-13.6 except that soil-pore liquid monitoring may be terminated 90 days after the last application of waste to the treatment zone; and\n(8) Establish a vegetative cover on the portion of the facility being closed at a time that the cover will not substantially impede degradation, transformation, or immobilization of hazardous constituents in the treatment zone. The vegetative cover shall be capable of maintaining growth without extensive maintenance.\n(b) For the purpose of complying with R315-8-7, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264.110 - 264.120, when closure is completed the owner or operator may submit to the Board certification by an independent qualified soil scientist, in lieu of an independent registered professional engineer, that the facility has been closed in accordance with the specifications in the approved closure plan.\n(c) During the post-closure care period the owner or operator shall:\n(1) Continue all operations, including pH control necessary to enhance degradation and transformation and sustain immobilization of hazardous constituents in the treatment zone to the extent that these measures are consistent with other post-closure care activities;\n(2) Maintain a vegetative cover over closed portions of the facility;\n(3) Maintain the run-on control system required under R315-8-13.4(c);\n(4) Maintain the run-off management system required under R315-8-13.4(d);\n(5) Control wind dispersal of hazardous waste if required under R315-8-13.4(f);\n(6) Continue to comply with any prohibitions or conditions concerning growth of food-chain crops under R315-8-13.5; and\n(7) Continue unsaturated zone monitoring in compliance with R315-8-13.6, except that soil-pore liquid monitoring may be terminated 90 days after the last application of waste to the treatment zone.\n(d) The owner or operator is not subject to regulation under R315-8-13.8(a)(8) and (c) if the Board finds that the level of hazardous constituents in the treatment zone soil does not exceed the background value of those constituents by an amount that is statistically significant when using the test specified in R315-8-13.8(d)(3). The owner or operator may submit such a demonstration to the Board at any time during the closure or post-closure care periods. For the purposes of this paragraph:\n(1) The owner or operator shall establish background soil values and determine whether there is a statistically significant increase over those values for all hazardous constituents specified in the facility plan under R315-8-13.2(b).\n(i) Background soil values may be based on a one-time sampling of a background plot having characteristics similar to those of the treatment zone.\n(ii) The owner or operator shall express background values and values for hazardous constituents in the treatment zone in a form necessary for the determination of statistically significant increases under R315-8- 13.8(d)(3).\n(2) In taking samples used in the determination of background and treatment zone values, the owner or operator shall take samples at a sufficient number of sampling points and at appropriate locations and depths to yield samples that represent the chemical make-up of soil that has not been affected by leakage from the treatment zone and the soil within the treatment zone, respectively.\n(3) In determining whether a statistically significant increase has occurred, the owner or operator shall compare the value of each constituent in the treatment zone to the background value for that constituent using a statistical procedure that provides reasonable confidence that constituent presence in the treatment zone will be identified. The owner or operator shall use a statistical procedure that:\n(i) Is appropriate for the distribution of the data used to establish background values; and\n(ii) Provides a reasonable balance between the probability of falsely identifying hazardous constituent presence in the treatment zone and the probability of failing to identify real presence in the treatment zone.\n(e) The owner or operator is not subject to regulation under section R315-8-6 if the Board finds that the owner or operator satisfies R315-8-13.8(d) and if unsaturated zone monitoring under R315-8-13.6 indicates that hazardous constituents have not migrated beyond the treatment zone during the active life of the land treatment unit.\n13.9 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR IGNITABLE OR REACTIVE WASTE\nThe owner or operator shall not apply ignitable or reactive waste to the treatment zone unless the waste and the treatment zone meet all applicable requirements of R315-13, R315-50-12, and R315-50-13, which incorporate by reference 40 CFR 268, and:\n(a) The waste is immediately incorporated into the soil so that:\n(1) The resulting waste, mixture, or dissolution of material no longer meets the definition of ignitable or reactive waste under R315-2-9(d) or (f); and\n(2) Section R315-8-2.8(b) is complied with; or\n(b) The waste is managed in a way that it is protected from any material or conditions which may cause it to ignite or react.\n13.10 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INCOMPATIBLE WASTES\nThe owner or operator shall not place incompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and materials, see 40 CFR 264, Appendix V for examples, in or on the same treatment zone, unless R315-8-2.8(b) is complied with.\n13.11 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR HAZARDOUS WASTES F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, F027\n(a) Hazardous Wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, and F027 shall not be placed in a land treatment unit unless the owner or operator operates the facility in accordance with a management plan for these wastes that is approved by the Executive Secretary pursuant to the standards set out in this paragraph, and in accord with all other applicable requirements of these rules. The factors to be considered are:\n(1) The volume, physical, and chemical characteristics of the wastes including their potential to migrate through soil or to volatilize or escape into the atmosphere;\n(2) The attenuative properties of underlaying and surrounding soils or other materials;\n(3) The mobilizing properties of other materials co-disposed with these wastes; and\n(4) The effectiveness of additional treatment, design, or monitoring techniques.\n(b) The Board may determine that additional design, operating, and monitoring requirements are necessary for land treatment facilities managing hazardous waste F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, and F027 in order to reduce the possibility of migration of these wastes to groundwater, surface water, or air so as to protect human health and the environment.\nR315-8-14. Landfills.\n14.1 APPLICABILITY\nThe rules in this section apply to owners and operators of facilities that dispose of hazardous waste in landfills, except as R315-8-1 provides otherwise.\n14.2 DESIGN AND OPERATING REQUIREMENTS\n(a) Any landfill that is not covered by R315-8-14.2(c) or R315-7-21.2(a) shall have a liner system for all portions of the landfill, except for existing portions of the landfill.

The leachate collection and removal system shall be:\n(i) Constructed of materials that are:\n(A) Chemically resistant to the waste managed in the landfill and the leachate expected to be generated; and\n(B) Of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressures exerted by overlying wastes, waste cover materials, and by any equipment used at the landfill; and\n(ii) Designed and operated to function without clogging through the scheduled closure of the landfill.\n(b) The owner or operator will be exempted from the requirements of R315-8-14.2(a) if the Board finds, based on a demonstration by the owner or operator, that alternative design and operating practices, together with location characteristics, will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituents, see R315-8-6.4, into the groundwater or surface water at any future time. In deciding whether to grant an exemption, the Board will consider:\n(1) The nature and quantity of the wastes;\n(2) The proposed alternate design and operation;\n(3) The hydrogeologic setting of the facility, including the attenuative capacity and thickness of the liners and soils present between the landfill and groundwater or surface water; and\n(4) All other factors which would influence the quality and mobility of the leachate produced and the potential for it to migrate to groundwater or surface water.\n(c) The owner or operator of each new landfill unit on which construction commences after January 29, 1992, each lateral expansion of a landfill unit on which construction commences after July 29, 1992, and each replacement of an existing landfill unit that is to commence reuse after July 29, 1992 shall install two or more liners and a leachate collection and removal system above and between such liners. \"Construction commences\" is as defined in R315-1- 1(b), which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 260.10, under \"existing facility.\"\n(1)(i) The liner system shall include:\n(A) A top liner designed and constructed of materials, e.g., a geomembrane, to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into such liner during the active life and post-closure care period; and\n(B) A composite bottom liner, consisting of at least two components. The upper component shall be designed and constructed of materials, e.g., a geomembrane, to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into this component during the active life and post-closure care period. The lower component shall be designed and constructed of materials to minimize the migration of hazardous constituents if a breach in the upper component were to occur. The lower component shall be constructed of at least three feet, 91 cm, of compacted soil material with a hydraulic conductivity of no more than 1 x 10-7 cm/sec.\n(ii) The liners shall comply with R315-8-14.2(a)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii).\n(2) The leachate collection and removal system immediately above the top liner shall be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to collect and remove leachate from the landfill during the active life and post- closure care period. The Executive Secretary will specify design and operating conditions in the permit to ensure that the leachate depth over the liner does not exceed 30 cm, one foot. The leachate collection and removal system shall comply with R315-8-14.2(c)(3)(iii) and (iv).\n(3) The leachate collection and removal system between the liners, and immediately above the bottom composite liner in the case of multiple leachate collection and removal systems, is also a leak detection system. This leak detection system shall be capable of detecting, collecting, and removing leaks of hazardous constituents at the earliest practicable time through all areas of the top liner likely to be exposed to waste or leachate during the active life and post-closure care period.

Nevertheless, even after this demonstration of compliance with the MACT standards, hazardous waste permit conditions that were based on the standards of R315-8 will continue to be in effect until they are removed from the permit or the permit is terminated or revoked, unless the permit expressly provides otherwise.\n(2) The MACT standards do not replace the closure requirements of R315-8-15.8 or the applicable requirements of R315-8-1 through R315-8-8, R315-8-18, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264 subpart BB, and R315-8-22, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 264 subpart CC.\n(3) The particulate matter standard of R315-8-15.4(b) remains in effect for incinerators that elect to comply with the alternative to the particulate matter standard of R307-214-2, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 63.1206(b)(14) and 63.1219(e).\n(4) The following requirements remain in effect for startup, shutdown, and malfunction events if you elect to comply with R315-3-9(a)(1)(i) to minimize emissions of toxic compounds from these events:\n(i) R315-8-15.6(a) requiring that an incinerator operate in accordance with operating requirements specified in the permit; and\n(ii) R315-8-15.6(c) requiring compliance with the emission standards and operating requirements during startup and shutdown if hazardous waste is in the combustion chamber, except for particular hazardous wastes.\n(5) The particulate matter standard of R315-8-15.4(b) remains in effect for incinerators that elect to comply with the alternative to the articulate matter standard of R307-214-2(39), which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 63.1206(b)(14) and 63.1219(e).\n(c) After consideration of the waste analysis included with part B of the permit application, the Executive Secretary, in establishing the permit conditions, shall exempt the applicant from all requirements of this section except R315-8-15.2, Waste Analysis and R315-8-15.8, Closure,\n(1) If the Executive Secretary finds that the waste to be burned is:\n(i) Listed as a hazardous waste in R315-2-10 or R315-2-11 solely because it is ignitable, Hazard Code I, corrosive Hazard Code C, or both; or\n(ii) Listed as a hazardous waste in R315-2-10 or R315-2-11 solely because it is reactive, Hazard Code R, for characteristics other than those listed in R315-2-9(f)(1)(iv) and (v), and will not be burned when other hazardous wastes are present in the combustion zone; or\n(iii) A hazardous waste solely because it possesses the characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, or both, as determined by the test for characteristics of hazardous wastes under R315-2-9, or\n(iv) A hazardous waste solely because it possesses any of the reactivity characteristics described by R315-2-9(f)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), (vi), (vii), and (viii) and will not be burned when other hazardous wastes are present in the combustion zone; and\n(2) If the waste analysis shows that the waste contains none of the hazardous constituents listed in R315-50-10, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 261 Appendix VIII, which could reasonably be expected to be in the waste.\n(d) If the waste to be burned is one which is described by R315-8-15.1(c)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) and contains insignificant concentrations of the hazardous constituents listed in R315-50-10, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 261 Appendix VIII, then the Executive Secretary may, in establishing permit conditions, exempt the applicant from all requirements of this section except R315-8-15.2, Waste analysis and R315-8-15.8, Closure, after consideration of the waste analysis included with part B of the permit application, unless the Executive Secretary finds that the waste will pose a threat to human health and the environment when burned in an incinerator.\n(e) The owner or operator of an incinerator may conduct trial burns subject only to the requirements of R315-3-6.3.\n15.2 WASTE ANALYSIS\n(a) As a portion of the trial burn plan required by R315-3-6.3 or with part B of the permit the owner or operator shall have included an analysis of the waste feed sufficient to provide all information required by R315-3- 6.3(b) or R315-3-2.10. Owners or operators of new hazardous waste incinerators shall provide the information required by R315-3-6.3(c) or R315-3-2.10 to the greatest extent possible.\n(b) Throughout normal operation the owner or operator shall conduct sufficient waste analysis to verify that waste feed to the incinerator is within the physical and chemical composition limits specified in his permit, R315-8-15.6.\n15.3 PRINCIPAL ORGANIC HAZARDOUS CONSTITUENTS (POHCS)\n(a) Principal Organic Hazardous Constituents (POHCs) in the waste feed shall be treated to the extent required by the performance standard of R315-8-15.4.\n(b)(1) One or more POHCs will be specified in the facility's permit, from among these constituents listed in R315-50-10, which incorporates by reference 40 CFR 261 Appendix VIII, for each waste feed to be burned. This specification will be based on the degree of difficulty of incineration of the organic constituents in the waste and on their concentration or mass in the waste feed, considering the results of waste analyses and trial burns or alternative data submitted with part B of the permit. Organic constituents which represent the greatest degree of difficulty of incineration will be those most likely to be designated as POHCs. Constituents are more likely to be designated as POHCs if they are present in large quantities or concentrations in the waste.\n(2) Trial POHCs will be designated for performance of trial burns in accordance with the procedure specified R315-3-6.3 for obtaining trial burn permits.\n15.4 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS\nAn incinerator burning hazardous waste shall be designed, constructed, and maintained so that, when operated in accordance with operating requirements specified under R315-8-15.6, it will meet the following performance standards:\n(a)(1) An incinerator burning hazardous waste shall achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.99% for each principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated, R315-8-15.3, in its permit for each waste feed. DRE is determined for each POHC from the following equation:\nDRE = (Win - Wout) / Win x 100%\nWhere:\nWin = Mass feed rate of one principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) in the waste stream feeding the incinerator, and\nWout = Mass emission rate of the same POHC present in exhaust emissions prior to release to the atmosphere.\n(2) An incinerator burning hazardous waste and producing stack emissions of more than 1.8 kilograms per hour, 4 pounds per hour, of hydrogen chloride (HC1) shall control HC1 emissions so that the rate of emission is no greater than the larger of either 1.8 kilograms per hour or one percent of the HC1 in the stack gas prior to entering any pollution control equipment.\n(b) An incinerator burning hazardous waste shall not emit particulate matter in excess of 180 milligrams per dry standard cubic meter, 0.08 grains per dry standard cubic foot, when corrected for the amount of oxygen in the stack gas according to the formula:\nPc = Pm x 14 / (21-Y)\nWhen Pc is correct concentration of particulate matter, Pm is the measured concentration of particulate matter, and Y is the measured concentration of oxygen in the stack gas, using the Orsat method for oxygen analysis of dry flue gas, as presented in 40 CFR 60 Appendix A Method 3. This correction procedure is to be used by all hazardous waste incinerators except those operating under conditions of oxygen enrichment. For these facilities, the Executive Secretary will select an appropriate correction procedure, to be specified in the facility permit.\n(c) For purposes of permit enforcement, compliance with the operating requirements specified in the permit under R315-8-15.6 will be regarded as compliance with this section. However, evidence that compliance with those permit conditions is insufficient to ensure compliance with the performance requirements of this section may be \"information\" justifying modification, revocation, or reissuance of a permit under R315-3-4.2.\n(d) An incinerator burning hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027 shall achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.9999% for each principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated, under R315-8-15.3, in its permit. This performance shall be demonstrated on POHCs that are more difficult to incinerate than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. DRE is determined for each POHC from the equation in R315-8-15.4(a)(1). In addition, the owner or operator of the incinerator shall notify the Executive Secretary of his intent to incinerate hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027.\n15.5 HAZARDOUS WASTE INCINERATOR PERMITS\n(a) The owner or operator of a hazardous waste incinerator may burn only wastes specified in his permit and only under operating conditions specified for those wastes under 8.15.6., except:\n(1) In approved trial burns, R315-3-6.3, or\n(2) Under exemptions created by R315-8-15.1.\n(b) Other hazardous wastes may be burned after operating conditions have been specified in a new permit or a permit modification, as applicable. Operating requirements for new wastes may be based on either trial burn results or alternative data included with part B of a permit under R315-3-2.10.\n(c) The permit for a new hazardous waste incinerator shall establish appropriate conditions for each of the applicable requirements of this section including but not limited to allowable waste feeds and operating conditions necessary to meet the requirements of R315-8-15.6, sufficient to comply with the following standards:\n(1) For the period beginning with initial introduction of hazardous waste to the incinerator and ending with initiation of the trial burn, and only for the minimum time required to establish operating conditions required in R315-8-15.5(c)(2), not to exceed a duration of 720 hours operating time for treatment of hazardous waste, the operating requirements shall be those most likely to ensure compliance with the performance standards in R315-8-15.4 based on the Executive Secretary's engineering judgement. The Executive Secretary may extend the duration of this period once for up to 720 additional hours when good cause for the extension is demonstrated by the applicant;\n(2) For the duration of the trial burn, the operating requirements shall be sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the performance standards of R315-8-15.4 and shall be in accordance with the approved trial burn plan;\n(3) For the period immediately following completion of the trial burn, and only for the minimum period sufficient to allow sample analysis, data computation, and submission of the trial burn results by the applicant, and review of the trial burn results and modification of the facility permit by the Executive Secretary, the operating requirements shall be those most likely to ensure compliance with the performance standards of R315-8-15.4 based on the Executive Secretary's engineering judgement.\n(4) For the remaining duration of the permit, the operating requirements shall be those demonstrated, in a trial burn or by alternative data specified in R315-3-2.10(c), as sufficient to ensure compliance with the performance standards of R315-8-15.4.\n15.6 OPERATING REQUIREMENTS\n(a) An incinerator shall be operated in accordance with operating requirements specified in the permit. These will be specified on a case-by-case basis as those demonstrated, in a trial burn or in alternative data as specified in R315-8-15.5(b), and included with part B of a facility's permit to be sufficient to comply with the performance standards of R315-8-15.4.\n(b) Each set of operating requirements will specify the composition of the waste feed, including acceptable variations in the physical or chemical properties of the waste feed which will not affect compliance with the performance requirements of R315-8-15.4, to which the operating requirements apply. For each such waste feed, the permit will specify acceptable operating limits including the following conditions:\n(1) Carbon monoxide (CO) level in the stack exhaust gas;\n(2) Waste feed rate;\n(4) An appropriate indicator of combustion gas velocity;\n(5) Allowable variations in incinerator system design or operating procedures; and\n(6) Any other operating requirements as are necessary to ensure that the performance standards of R315-8-15.4 are met.\n(c) During start-up and shut-down of an incinerator, hazardous waste, except wastes exempted in accordance with R315-8-15.1, shall not be fed into the incinerator unless the incinerator is operating within the conditions of operation, temperature, air feed rate, etc., specified in the permit.\n(d) Fugitive emissions from the combustion zone shall be controlled by:\n(1) Keeping the combustion zone totally sealed against fugitive emissions; or\n(2) Maintaining a combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure; or\n(3) An alternative means of control demonstrated, with part B of the permit to provide fugitive emissions control equivalent to maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure.\n(e) An incinerator shall be operated with a functioning system to automatically cut off waste feed to the incinerator when operating conditions deviate from limits established under R315-8-15.6(a).\n(f) An incinerator shall cease operation when changes in waste feed, incinerator design, or operating conditions exceed limits designated in its permit.\n15.7 MONITORING AND INSPECTIONS\n(a) The owner or operator shall conduct, as a minimum, the following monitoring while incinerating hazardous waste:\n(1) Combustion temperature, waste feed rate, and the indicator of combustion gas velocity specified in the facility permit shall be monitored on a continuous basis.\n(2) Carbon monoxide (CO) shall be monitored on a continuous basis at a point in the incinerator downstream of the combustion zone and prior to release to the atmosphere.\n(3) Upon request by the Board, sampling and analysis of the waste and exhaust emissions shall be conducted to verify that the operating requirements established in the permit achieve the performance standards of R315-8- 15.4.\n(b) The incinerator and associated equipment, pumps, valves, conveyors, pipes, etc., shall be subjected to thorough visual inspection, at least daily, for leaks, spills, fugitive emissions, and signs of tampering.\n(c) The emergency waste feed cutoff system and associated alarms shall be tested at least weekly to verify operability, unless the applicant demonstrates to the Board that weekly inspections will unduly restrict or upset operations and that less frequent inspections will be adequate. At a minimum, operational testing shall be conducted at least monthly.\n(d) This monitoring and inspection data shall be recorded and the records shall be placed in the operating record required by R315-8-5.3, which incorporates by reference 264.73.\n15.8 CLOSURE\nAt closure the owner or operator shall remove all hazardous waste and hazardous waste residues, including, but not limited to, ash, scrubber waters, and scrubber sludges, from the incinerator site.\nAt closure, as throughout the operating period, unless the owner or operator can demonstrate, in accordance with R315-2-3(d), that the residue removed from the incinerator is not a hazardous waste, the owner or operator becomes a generator of hazardous waste and shall manage it in accordance with applicable requirements.

Campo Environmental Protection Agency (CEPA).  The Solid Waste\r\nManagement Plan addresses issues related to the generation, handling,\r\ntransportation, storage, disposal and/or treatment of solid waste on\r\nthe Campo Indian Reservation.  This document has been prepared by\r\nCEPA, with the assistance of ERC Environmental and Energy Services\r\nCompany, Inc., pursuant to the Solid Waste Code of 1990.  The Solid\r\nWaste Management Plan establishes goals and priorities for solid waste\r\nmanagement and outlines resources required to attain those goals.\r\n\r\nRecent achievements in solid waste management on the Campo Reservation\r\ninclude the establishment of the Solid Waste Code and the\r\nestablishment of Solid Waste Regulations; these were adopted by the\r\nGeneral Council February 10, 1991.  The Solid Waste Regulations govern\r\nthe siting, permitting, construction, operation, closure, and\r\npost-closure maintenance of all solid waste facilities on the\r\nReservation including recycling, treatment, composting, and disposal\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nDisposal in open dumps is prohibited on the Reservation.  Further, all\r\nsolid waste, including but not limited to solid waste originating from\r\noff-Reservation, must either be used for resource recovery, disposed\r\nof in sanitary landfills, or otherwise disposed of in an\r\nenvironmentally sound manner, and in compliance with CEPA rules and\r\nregulations.  Hazardous waste is not permitted to be generated,\r\nhandled, stored, treated, or disposed on the Reservation, with the\r\nexception of household hazardous waste.  Hazardous waste generated by\r\nhouseholds will be managed through the CEPA household hazardous waste\r\nprogram as described herein.\r\n\r\nIn addition, CEPA is initiating programs for solid waste collection\r\nand transportation off the Reservation, as well as several special\r\nwastes programs such as the junk car removal program.\r\n\r\n                                  ES-1\r\n\r\n                                 SECTION I\r\n                  OVERVIEW OF THE CAMPO INDIAN RESERVATION\r\n\r\n1.1  AGENCIES INVOLVED IN SOLID WASTE\r\n\r\nSolid waste issues on the Campo Indian Reservation are the\r\nresponsibility of two main agencies, the General Council of the Campo\r\nBand of Mission Indians (Campo Band)  and the Campo Environmental\r\nProtection Agency (CEPA).\r\n\r\nThe General Council is the legislative branch of the Tribal government\r\nof the Campo Indian Reservation.  It has used its authority to develop\r\ngeneral policies and procedures regarding solid waste management and\r\ncontrol.  The General Council has also developed CEPA as the lead\r\nTribal Agency for solid waste management.  CEPA is responsible for\r\nvarious duties relating to the solid waste management program,\r\nincluding the following:\r\n\r\n       o   the implementation and enforcement of policies, ordinances\r\n           and regulations;\r\n\r\n       o   the implementation of solid waste management plans;\r\n\r\n       o   the collection, processing and disposal of solid waste;\r\n\r\n       o   the development of procedures for carrying out permit and\r\n           inspection programs;\r\n\r\n       o   the execution of studies and investigations regarding new\r\n           and/or improved methods of solid waste handling, recycling,\r\n           treatment, composting and disposal;\r\n\r\n       o   the implementation of public information programs;\r\n\r\n       o   the execution of studies on the nature, extent and methods\r\n           of reducing and controlling litter problems.\r\n\r\nCEPA also has the authority to act on any complaints or actions of\r\nviolation of law, regulation, or permit concerning solid waste, and to\r\ndetermine an appropriate course of action including such actions as\r\nissuance of cease and desist orders; suspension, revocation or\r\nmodification of permits; and imposition of civil penalties.  CEPA is\r\nalso responsible for the monitoring of soil, water and air quality,\r\nand enforcing the soil, water and air quality requirements as\r\nestablished by the General Council.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1-1 LOCATION OF CAMPO INDIAN RESERVATION - SEE HARD COPY\r\n\r\n1.2  POPULATION TRENDS\r\n\r\nThe total Campo Band enrollment is 214, with approximately half of the\r\nmembership living off-Reservation.  Projected growth trends of the\r\nCampo Band indicate that the total enrollment will reach 355 by the\r\nyear 2005; the percentage of the membership living off-Reservation\r\nwill remain at roughly 50 percent\r\n\r\n1.3  RESERVATION CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\nThe Campo Indian Reservation encompasses approximately 15,480 acres in\r\nsoutheast San Diego County, approximately 70 miles southeast of\r\ndowntown San Diego.  The Reservation consists of two separate areas; \r\nthe main Campo Reservation encompasses approximately 14,870 acres, and\r\nthe smaller portion of 610 acres (Figure 1-1).\r\n\r\nThe main Campo Indian Reservation is bordered on the south by the\r\nUnited States/Mexico international border, 0.4 miles south of the\r\nCampo Indian Reservation border.  The Reservation is bounded on the\r\nnorth by the Manzanita Indian Reservation.  Interstate 8 and Highway\r\n94 bisect the Reservation, while the San Diego-Arizona Eastern\r\nRailroad transacts the southern portion of the Reservation (U.S.G.S.\r\nquadrangles:  Cameron Corners, Campo, Live Oak Springs and Tierra del\r\nSol) (Figure 1-1).\r\n\r\n1.3.1  Geography and Geomorphology\r\n\r\nThe Reservation lies within the geomorphic province of the Peninsular\r\nRanges.  This large province is bounded on the west by the Pacific\r\nOcean and on the east by the by the Colorado Desert province.  The\r\nprovince consists of large fault blocks, oriented in a\r\nnorthwest-southeast direction.  These blocks have a gentle westerly\r\nslope and a steep eastern slope.  The regional faulting has produced a\r\njoint trend that strikes N 10 W to N 20 W. There is also a major joint\r\ntrend that strikes N 80 W to due west (Bond 1971).\r\n\r\nThe major body of rock that underlies the province is the igneous\r\ncomplex of the Southern California Batholith.  More specifically, the\r\nReservation overlies the La Posta Pluton.  Associated with the La\r\nPosta Pluton are regional cooling joints, which in the Reservation\r\narea strike northwest.\r\n\r\nTopographically, the landform of the Reservation is the result of\r\nuplifting of an old erosional surface (peneplain) followed by the\r\nincision of streams (Chambers Group Inc., 1990).  The regional joint\r\npatterns have been a controlling factor in erosion.  The steep canyons\r\nare controlled by the northwest trending structural and cooling\r\njoints, while the east-west joint pattern has controlled the direction\r\nand location of the principal stream channels.\r\n\r\nThe present day drainage pattern is trellis in nature, and the\r\ntopography is composed of gently rolling hills.  The elevations range\r\nfrom 3180 to 4561 feet above mean sea level.  The primary process\r\ncontrolling the present topography is weathering by exfoliation.  In\r\nthis process the crystalline rock weathers in a uniform concentric\r\nmanner producing rounded hills and large round crystalline remnants.\r\n\r\n1.3.2  Geology\r\n\r\nThe geology of the Reservation is a result of Nevadan age plutonism\r\n(115 to 120 million years ago).  This plutonic complex forms the\r\nSouthern California Batholith.  Common types of rocks found in the\r\ngeneral area include gabbro, quartz diorite (tonalite)  and\r\ngranodiorite (Reese-Chambers Systems Consultants, Inc. (RCSC) 1990).\r\n\r\nThe basement complex is composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks. \r\nThe basement rock includes Cretaceous-age Woodson Mountain\r\nGranodiorite and San Marcos Gabbro, Jurassic-age Stonewall Quartz\r\nDiorite, and the Triassic-age metamorphic Julian Schist (Moyle and\r\nDowning 1977).\r\n\r\nThe younger rocks are primarily tonalites (quartz diorites) and their\r\nweathering products.  The tonalites include the Lakeview Mountain\r\nTonalite and the Bonsall Tonalite both of Cretaceous age (Moyle and\r\nDowning 1977).  These tonalites are white to gray colored and are\r\nmedium to coarsely crystalline.  A tonalite is typically composed of\r\n60 percent quartz (RCSC 1990).  The tonalite weathers to depths of 200\r\nfeet and is primarily weathered by exfoliation (Westin 1974).\r\n\r\nSurficial deposits of Quaternary alluvium exist in the stream valleys.\r\nThe alluvium is typically composed of gravel, sand, silt and clay. The\r\nthickness of the alluvium varies from I to 100 feet (Moyle and Downing\r\n1977).\r\n\r\n1.3.3  Seismic Potential\r\n\r\nThere are no known active faults in the immediate vicinity, although,\r\na few small faults of unknown nature exist in close proximity (RCSC\r\n1990).  Known active faults in the region include the Elsinore Fault\r\nZone and the San Jacinto Fault Zone.  The maximum credible earthquakes\r\non these faults are 7 and 7.5 on the Richter Scale respectively.  The\r\nElsinore is the closest fault zone (approximately 15 miles to the\r\nnortheast)  of the Reservation.  The maximum ground acceleration\r\npredicted in the Campo Reservation area is 0.3g, which would result in\r\nmodified Mercalli Intensity of VIII (Table 1-1).\r\n\r\n1.3.4  Soils\r\n\r\nTwelve different soils exist on the Campo Indian Reservation (Table\r\n1-2).  Most of the soils are coarse sandy loams and are well to\r\nexcessively drained.  Most of the soils may be characterized by\r\nmoderate to rapid permeability; runoff is slow to moderate and erosion\r\nis slight to moderate.  In general, soils exist on moderate sloping\r\nsurfaces and are found on alluvial fans, uplands and somewhat on\r\nmountainous areas (Bowman 1975)  (Figure 1-2).  A site investigation\r\nin the southern portion of the Reservation has revealed poor soil\r\ndevelopment (Dames & Moore personal communication 1991).\r\n\r\n1.3.5  Climate\r\n\r\nThe Reservation is located in a transitional environment between the\r\narid desert zone and the cool Mediterranean zone found in the Mount\r\nLaguna area.  The average temperature ranges from 58.1 to 94.3 degrees\r\nFahrenheit (Pryde 1976).\r\n\r\nA century of rainfall records indicate the average annual rainfall to\r\nbe 16.54 inches per year.  The range of annual rainfall varies from\r\n35.31 inches in 1891 to 5.07 inches in 1989 (RCSC 1990).\r\n\r\nTABLE 1-1:  MODIFIED MERCALLI SCALE, 1956 VERSION - SEE HARD COPY\r\n\r\n                            Table 1-2\r\n\r\n                SOILS OF THE CAMPO INDIAN RESERVATION\r\n\r\nSoil                       Percent\r\nSymbol   Soil Name         Slope                  Description\r\n\r\nCaC     Calpine Coarse    5 to 9    Well drained; form over granite\r\n         sandy loam                 alluvium; runoff slow to medium;\r\n                                    erosion  hazard  slight to moderate;\r\n                                    permeability is moderately  rapid.\r\n\r\nCaC2   Calpine coarse     5 to 9    Well drained; sheet erosion common;\r\n        sandy loam                  runoff slow to medium; erosion\r\n                                    hazard slight to moderate;\r\n                                    permeability is moderately rapid.\r\n\r\nKcC    Kitchen Creek      5 to 9    Excessively drained; forms in\r\n       loamy coarse sand            material derived from\r\n                                    granodiorite; exists on gently\r\n                                    rolling broad ridges; permeability\r\n                                    is moderately rapid; runoff is\r\n                                    slow to medium; erosion hazard is\r\n                                    slight to medium.\r\n\r\nKcD2   Kitchen Creek      9 to 15   Excessively  drained;  forms  over\r\n       loamy coarse sand            decomposed granitic rock; strongly\r\n                                    sloping; runoff is medium; erosion\r\n                                    hazard is moderate; rill and gully\r\n                                    erosion is moderate.\r\n\r\nLaE2   La Posta          5 to 30    Excessively  drained;  forms  over\r\n       loamy coarse sand            granodiorite; forms on gently\r\n                                    rolling to hilly topography;\r\n                                    permeability is rapid; runoff is\r\n                                    medium; erosion hazard is\r\n                                    moderate; rill and gully erosion\r\n                                    is moderate.\r\n\r\nLaE3   La Posta          5 to 30    Severely eroded; heavy rill and\r\n       loamy coarse sand            gully erosion; runoff is medium;\r\n                                    erosion hazard  is  moderate to\r\n                                    high; permeability is rapid.\r\n\r\nLcE2   La Posta           5 to 30   Eroded; rill and gully erosion is\r\n       rocky loamy coarse           moderate; runoff is medium; erosion\r\n       sand                         hazard is  moderate.\r\n\r\n Lu    Loamy alluvial     0 to 5    Occurs in valleys; poorly drained;\r\n       land                         very deep silty and sandy loams;\r\n                                    permeability is moderate.\r\n\r\nMvC    Mottsville         2 to 9    Occurs in valleys and alluvial fans;\r\n       loamy coarse sand            excessively drained; permeability\r\n                                    is very rapid; runoff is slow to\r\n                                    medium; erosion hazard is slight\r\n                                    to medium.\r\n\r\nMvD    Mottsville         9 to 15   Occurs in alluvial fans; excessively\r\n       loamy coarse sand            drained; runoff is medium; \r\n                                    erosion hazard  is  moderate.\r\n\r\nToE2   Tollhouse          5 to 30   Excessively drained; shallow to\r\n       rocky coarse sandy           very shallow; occurs on slopes in\r\n       loam                         mountain upland; rocky outcrops;\r\n                                    permeability is rapid; runoff is\r\n                                    medium to rapid; erosion hazard is\r\n                                    moderate to high.\r\n\r\nTo6    Tollhouse          30 to 65  Occurs on steep to very steep\r\n       rocky coarse sandy           slopes; large boulders cover up 20\r\n       loam                         to 25 percent of the area; runoff\r\n                                    is rapid to very rapid; erosion\r\n                                    hazard is high to very high.\r\n\r\n Source: Bowman 1975\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3.6  Hydrology\r\n\r\nThe Reservation is located in the Campo Subunit of the Tia Juana\r\nHydrographic Unit (California State Water Resources Control Board\r\n[RWQCB] 1975).\r\n\r\n1.3.6.1  Surface Water Resources\r\n\r\nA majority of the surface flow in the main Reservation drains to Campo\r\nCreek, which flows to the west to the Tia Juana River.  A small\r\nportion of land east of the Tecate Divide drains to the east.  Campo\r\nCreek is a large intermittent creek that flows through Diablo Valley. \r\nSeveral springs in Diablo Canyon discharge perennially.  A few of\r\nthese springs are located off-Reservation at the town of Live Oak\r\nSprings.\r\n\r\nThe beneficial uses for surface water in this area are delineated by\r\nthe San Diego Region of the California State Water Resources Control\r\nBoard and include:  water contact and non-contact recreation, warm\r\nwater fish habitat and wildlife habitat (RWQCB 1975).  Extensive\r\nutilization of the surface water seems improbable because of the lack\r\nof abundant constant surface flow.\r\n\r\n1.3.6.2  Ground-Water Resources\r\n\r\nThis portion of San Diego County in which the Reservation is located\r\nis dependent on the ground-water resources locally available. \r\nBeneficial uses of ground water include: municipal/domestic water\r\nsupply, agricultural water supply, industrial water supply and\r\npotential ground-water recharge (RWQCB 1975).\r\n\r\nIn the general vicinity of the Campo Indian Reservation, the primary\r\nsource of ground water is located in the residual weathered material\r\nfrom the tonalite rocks.  There is also some ground water found in the\r\nopen fractures of the deeper unweathered tonalite (Chambers Group,\r\nInc.  1990).  Site investigations in the southern portion of the\r\nReservation have found residual weathered rock that range from 80 to\r\n100 feet thick (Dames & Moore personal communication 1991).  Valleys\r\nsuch as Campo Creek Valley contain varying thicknesses of alluvial\r\nfill.  This alluvial fill is often saturated and is a source of ground\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe water table roughly conforms to the surface topography, with the\r\ntopographic highs acting as local ground water divides.  In general,\r\nthe depth to ground water is greater on the topographic highs and the\r\ndepth to ground-water is at a minimum in the valleys (RCSC 1990).  The\r\ndepth to ground water in this region varies from 20 to 80 feet below\r\nthe ground surface (Westin 1974).  The topography maintains a strong\r\ncontrol on ground-water flow directions, and the regional ground-water\r\nflow direction appears to be towards the southwest.  Wells in the area\r\nmay be expected to produce 2 to 200 gallons per minute.  Springs and\r\nseeps occur throughout the Reservation (RCSC 1990).\r\n\r\nGround-water quality in the vicinity of the Reservation is generally\r\ngood to excellent, although, some water samples have revealed high\r\nconcentrations of nitrates.  The ground water is typically calcium or\r\nsodium bicarbonate in character with total dissolved solids ranging\r\nfrom 250 to 750 milligrams/liter (RWQCB 1975).\r\n\r\n                              SECTION 2\r\n               SOLID WASTE GENERATION/CHARACTERIZATION\r\n\r\n2.1  SOLID WASTE GENERATION TRENDS\r\n\r\nThis subsection includes a discussion of solid waste generated by\r\nresidents of the Campo Indian Reservation.  The discussion is focused\r\non the amount of solid waste currently generated within the exterior\r\nboundaries of the Reservation and the amount that may be generated in\r\nthe future.  In addition, this subsection includes a discussion of\r\nsolid waste generated in the County of San Diego.  Population trends,\r\nprojected growth, and density distributions for San Diego County are\r\nprovided to estimate the amount of waste that may potentially be\r\nimported to the Reservation.\r\n\r\n2.1.1  Campo Indian Reservation\r\n\r\nAs provided in Section 1.2, the present population of the Reservation\r\n(Campo Band members living on the Reservation)  is roughly 110, and\r\nestimates for the year 2005 indicate that approximately 180 people\r\nwill reside within the boundaries of the Reservation at that time.\r\n\r\nThe estimate of the amount of solid waste generated on the Reservation\r\nis based upon types of \"operations\" generating waste and on studies of\r\ntypical waste streams.  For example, a community's solid waste stream\r\nmay consist of residential, industrial, agricultural, and commercial\r\nwaste.  The waste streams generated on the Reservation are primarily\r\nresidential.  A small commercial waste stream is generated by the\r\nCampo Tribal Hall;  the sand and gravel, farming and ranching\r\nactivities on the Reservation essentially are waste-free.\r\n\r\nAccording to a study conducted by the U.S.  Congress, Office of\r\nTechnology Assessment (OTA) in which sample information was obtained\r\non solid waste generation rates for 28 cities and 9 counties in the\r\nUnited States (the cities and counties were selected to represent\r\nlarge and small communities from all regions of the country), the\r\naverage per-capita generation rate of residential waste is 2.6 pounds\r\nper day, or approximately 0.48 tons per year.\r\n\r\nPer capita solid waste generation for solid waste streams consisting\r\nof residential, commercial, and institutional wastes may be affected\r\nby a variety of factors.  Factors include geographic location, season\r\nof the year, socioeconomic status, household size, demands for\r\nconvenience, degree of urbanization, legislation, and public\r\nattitudes.  Tchobanoglous et al. (1977) provides a typical per capita\r\ngeneration rate from residential and commercial sources as 3.5 pounds\r\nper day (0.64 tons per year).  OTA's study resulted in a generation\r\nrate average of 4.5 pounds per day per person (0.82 tons per year per\r\nperson) for waste streams consisting of residential waste in addition\r\nto wastes from commercial and industrial sources.  The California\r\nWaste Management Board reported in 1985 that on an average, almost 1.5\r\ntons of solid waste are generated annually for each person in\r\nCalifornia (CWMB 1985).\r\n\r\nBased on these data and the fact that solid waste generated on the\r\nReservation is primarily from residential sources, a per-capita solid\r\nwaste generation rate of 0.50 tons per year will be used as a basis\r\nfor solid waste management planning at the Campo Indian Reservation. \r\nThis rate may increase in the future if industrial or commercial\r\noperations are established on the Reservation; this rate may decrease\r\nin the future if waste reduction and recycling efforts are successful.\r\n\r\nA solid waste generation rate of 0.5 tons per person per year is\r\nnearly 2.75 pounds of solid waste per person per day.  This is roughly\r\nequivalent to 77 pounds per week of solid waste for each family of 4\r\nliving on the Reservation.  For population estimates for residents of\r\nthe Reservation of 110 in 1990 and 180 in 2005, the estimated amount\r\nof solid waste generated on the Reservation is currently 55 tons per\r\nyear, and 90 tons per year in 15 years.\r\n\r\n2.1.2  San Diego County\r\n\r\nSolid waste generation trends for the County of San Diego are provided\r\nbelow.  Inclusion of this information is provided to evaluate the\r\nextent to which the Campo Indian Reservation and the County may share\r\nin solid waste responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG)  is the regional\r\nagency that collects population data and distributes the information\r\nto its member agencies.  According to SANDAG, the population in San\r\nDiego County increased by 648,000 persons from 1,874,800 to 2,522,800\r\nfrom 1980 through 1989.  The population in the County was determined\r\nto be 2.1 million in 1985.\r\n\r\nThe largest numeric increases in population from 1980 to 1990 are\r\nattributed to San Diego (235,000), Oceanside (51,700), Chula Vista\r\n(51,236), Escondido (44,280), and Vista (36,038).  The five\r\njurisdictions which grew by the greatest percentage are San Marcos\r\n(123.0 percent), Vista (100.6 percent), Carlsbad (77.9 percent), \r\nEscondido (68.8 percent), and Oceanside (67.4 percent).  San Diego and\r\nunincorporated areas (Poway, Santee, Encinitas, and Solana Beach were\r\nnot incorporated at the time of the 1980 census, however, combined\r\npopulation data was reviewed)  had the largest population in 1990,\r\nwith 1.1 million and 398,000, respectively.  While Chula Vista,\r\nOceanside, and Escondido had populations of 135,000, 128,000, and\r\n108,000, respectively.\r\n\r\nPopulation projections forecast an increase to 3.2 million persons by\r\nthe year 2010;  the projected forecast indicates a population increase\r\nof approximately 44,000 new residents a year.  This is \"a nearly 50\r\npercent increase in the existing population ...\"  (SANDAG).  Roughly\r\n75 percent of San Diego County's annual increase is expected from\r\nmigration, while 25 percent is expected to be due to natural increase\r\nwithin the resident population.\r\n\r\nSANDAG compiled population data for San Diego and its incorporated\r\ncities and projected populations of each region for the year 2000. \r\nTable 2-1 depicts SANDAG's findings.  According to the table, Carlsbad\r\nand San Marcos will be the fastest growing cities with increases in\r\npopulation of roughly 92 percent and 108 percent respectively.  Other\r\nNorth County cities that will experience a rapid growth rate through\r\nthe year 2000 are Oceanside with an increase of 41 percent and Poway\r\nwith increases of 35 percent.  The cities around San Diego Bay will\r\nexperience lower growth rates over the next 10 years.  Imperial Beach\r\nis expected to have the greatest population increase with growth of\r\napproximately 24 percent.  In East County, Lemon Grove and Santee will\r\nhave the largest population increases, 25 percent and 45 percent\r\nrespectively, while La Mesa and El Cajon are expected to show very low\r\ngrowth rates.  SANDAG estimates that the City of San Diego's\r\npopulation will increase by roughly 17 percent with a significant\r\nportion of that growth occurring in the Otay Mesa border area of the\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nAs the population of San Diego County has increased over the years,\r\nthe quantity of solid waste generated in the county has also been\r\nsteadily increasing.  According to the San Diego County Regional Solid\r\nWaste Management Plan, dated 1986, the per-capita solid waste\r\ngeneration rate in San Diego County in 1985 was estimated to be 1.455\r\ntons per year.  The economic base within San Diego County is heavily\r\ndependent upon trade, influence generation rates are primarily\r\neconomic; the types of industry and amount of construction in the\r\nCounty will greatly influence per capita solid waste generation rates.\r\nBased upon a population of 2.7 million in San Diego County in the year\r\n2000, the amount of waste generated at that time in the County may be\r\n3.5 million tons to 5.8 million tons per year, compared to\r\napproximately 3.1 million tons per year in 1985.\r\n\r\nTABLE 2-1:  TOTAL POPULATION IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY BY JURISDICTION\r\n            1985-2000 - SEE HARD COPY\r\n\r\n\r\n2.2 SOLID WASTE COMPOSITION AND CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\nThis subsection includes an evaluation of the nature of the solid\r\nwaste generated by residents of the Campo Indian Reservation.  In\r\naddition, this subsection includes a discussion of the nature of solid\r\nwaste generated in the County of San Diego.  The information provided in\r\nthis subsection may be used by CEPA in planning for various solid waste\r\nmanagement techniques.\r\n\r\n2.2.1 Campo Indian Reservation\r\n\r\nThe solid waste generated on the Campo Indian Reservation is primarily\r\nresidential waste.  Residential solid waste typically is composed of\r\nfood wastes and rubbish such as paper, cardboard, plastics, textiles,\r\nleather, wood, furniture, garden trimmings, glass, crockery, aluminum\r\ncans, metals, and soil.\r\n\r\nTABLE 2-2:  SOLID WASTE GENERATION IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY BY REGION - SEE\r\nHARD COPY\r\n\r\nIndustrial, agricultural, or commercial waste streams are generally\r\nnot generated at the present time on the Reservation.  Activities at\r\nthe Campo Tribal Hall generate office wastes such as office/computer\r\npaper, and infectious wastes at the medical clinic such as hypodermic\r\nneedles, and cotton balls.  In addition, septic tanks associated with\r\nbuildings on the Reservation are periodically pumped.\r\n\r\nThe residential waste generated on the Reservation is likely to\r\ncontain an amount of recyclable material.  Data compiled by OTA from\r\nnine studies indicate that the largest categories of materials in\r\nsolid waste by weight (solid waste meaning combined residential,\r\ncommercial, industrial waste streams)  are paper and yard wastes. \r\nTable 2-3 summarizes these studies.  Variation in the estimates can be\r\nattributed to differences in sampling and definitions.  Other possible\r\ncauses of variability include location, socioeconomic conditions and\r\nseasonality.  These data may serve to assess the percentage of paper,\r\nmetal, glass and plastics that comprise the residential waste stream\r\non the Reservation.  It is estimated that 60 percent of the\r\nresidential waste generated within the Reservation's boundaries is\r\nmade up of paper, plastic, glass, and metal.\r\n\r\n2.2.2 San Diego County\r\n\r\nThe character of the waste generated in San Diego County has changed\r\nslightly in the past two decades.  Since 1970 plastics in the waste\r\nstream have increased roughly 6 percent to make up nearly 8 percent of\r\nthe total waste generated.  In addition, recycling efforts have caused\r\na reduction of ferrous metal cans and an increase of aluminum cans.\r\n\r\nIn 1982 a waste composition study was conducted at the Miramar and\r\nOtay landfills to assess waste components of the the waste stream. \r\nTable 2-4 represents the results of the study.  The samples were taken\r\nfrom both landfills and were chosen at random, representing both\r\nresidential and commercial waste sources.  Analysis of the samples was\r\nperformed within each of the three waste sources on a residential,\r\ncommercial, and combined basis.  The results of this study also\r\nindicate that 60 percent of residential waste is composed of paper,\r\nplastic, metal, and glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 2-3:  ESTIMATED PERCENTAGES OF SOLID WASTE COMPONENTS, BY\r\n            WEIGHT - SEE HARD COPY\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 2-4:  WASTE STREAM ANALYSIS COMPONENT FACTIONS OF COMBINED\r\n            SAMPLES MIRAMAR AND OTAY LANDFILLS - MARCH 1982 (ALL\r\n            VALUES IN PERCENT) - SEE HARD COPY\r\n\r\n\r\n2.3 SOURCE REDUCTION PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nPreceding paragraphs discussed the amount and type of solid waste\r\ngenerated on the Reservation and that expected to be generated in the\r\nfuture.  The amount of solid waste generated minus the amount reduced\r\nor recycled is the amount of solid waste that must either be disposed\r\nor treated.  Solid waste disposal and treatment are discussed in\r\nSections 4 and 5 of the CEPA Solid Waste Management Plan.\r\n\r\nA discussion of CEPA's source reduction programs is provided below. \r\nSource reduction programs include both reducing the amount of solid\r\nwaste generated and recycling solid waste that is generated.  These\r\nprograms are aimed at decreasing the amount of solid waste that must\r\nbe landfilled or treated.\r\n\r\nWaste reduction includes all measures that will:\r\n\r\n        o  Keep products and containers out of the waste stream by\r\n           extending product life and the reuse of products and\r\n           containers in their original form.\r\n\r\n        o  Decrease the amount of material discarded by reducing\r\n           unnecessary consumption or by using products that lead to\r\n           less waste.\r\n\r\n        o  Reduce the material used and discarded in the production\r\n           process.\r\n\r\nCEPA's waste reduction program essentially involves public education\r\nefforts to provide consumers with information on reducing volumes of\r\nresidential waste.  Consumers can participate in waste reduction in\r\nmany ways, including the following:\r\n\r\n        o  Purchase products with waste reduction in mind.  Products\r\n           with minimum packaging contribute to the goal of waste\r\n           reduction.  Often purchasing products in bulk form almost\r\n           eliminates the need for packaging.\r\n\r\n        o  Purchase products that have combined purpose, are\r\n           repairable, are reused or can be recycled, and are built\r\n           for quality and longevity.\r\n\r\n        o  Repair items instead of buying new ones.\r\n\r\n        o  Pass useful discards onto others through garage sales or\r\n           service organizations.\r\n\r\n        o  Reuse containers whenever possible.\r\n\r\n        o  Buy beverages in refillable containers.\r\n\r\n        o  Avoid throwaway items such as paper cups, disposable\r\n           razors, disposable lighters.\r\n\r\nCEPA's waste reduction program concentrates on preventing excessive\r\nwaste generation at its source, while CEPA's recycling program deals\r\nwith waste once it has been generated.  Below is a discussion of\r\nrecycling efforts on the Reservation.\r\n\r\nThe solid waste streams generated on the Reservation are primarily\r\nhousehold wastes, with some office waste.  It is estimated that nearly\r\n60 percent of the waste generated on the Reservation is recyclable. \r\nAs such, the primary method for the reduction of the volume of solid\r\nwaste to be ultimately disposed in landfills or treated, is through\r\nthe recycling of paper, ferrous metal, aluminum, glass, and plastics.\r\n\r\nAs a collective goal, the Campo Band is committed to reducing the\r\namount of solid waste that must be disposed or treated.  Because the\r\namount of recyclable wastes (i.e., paper, ferrous metal, aluminum,\r\nglass and plastics) produced on the Reservation is smaller than would\r\nbe feasible for CEPA to create unique markets for recyclables, CEPA's\r\nsource reduction program consists of bringing household recyclables to\r\nestablished recycling centers in San Diego County.\r\n\r\nThe San Diego County Department of Public Works and the City of San\r\nDiego Waste Management Department currently operate the I Love A Clean\r\nSan Diego recycling program.  The program consists of recycling\r\ncenters and curbside programs located throughout the county. \r\nCurrently, San Diego County offers two curbside pick-up locations in\r\nCampo.  One location on Buckman Springs Road (1 mile north of Highway\r\n94 at Cameron Comers), accepts aluminum cans, newspaper, California\r\nredemption value glass, and other glass for donation only.  Bins are\r\nlocated at this location Friday through Monday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00\r\np.m.. The second program is located at 32102 Highway 94 and is\r\ncoordinated by Rocky Mountain Recycling.  Rocky Mountain Recycling\r\nwill reimburse deposits of aluminum cans, aluminum scrap, other metal,\r\nnewspaper, California redemption value glass, and other glass on\r\nFridays, Saturdays and Mondays from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and on\r\nWednesday from 11:00 a.m. from 5:00 p.m.  (To confirm indicated\r\npick-up locations and times, the number for the recycling program is\r\n(619) 270-8189 or 1-800-237-2583.)\r\n\r\nCurrently recycling is conducted on an individual basis on the\r\nReservation.  Band-wide efforts are being initiated, and recycling of\r\npaper generated in the tribal office will begin no later than Fall\r\n1991.  CEPA is also considering the acquisition of several containers\r\nfor the collection of recyclable materials from households such as\r\npaper, glass, metal, and plastics (California redemption value). \r\nThese would be clearly labeled as designated for specific recycle\r\ncategories of waste materials, placed near the Tribal Hall and emptied\r\nby a Band member on a regular basis.  Revenues generated will help to\r\noffset costs of solid waste collection services on the Reservation.\r\n\r\nThe Campo Band members do not dispose yard wastes or septic tank\r\nwastes into the solid waste stream, and reduction of these waste\r\nstreams by treatment or recycling is therefore not considered in the\r\nsource reduction programs.  Yard wastes are not generated in large\r\nquantities and are generally either used as fuel or absorbed into\r\nnatural terrain on the Reservation.  Septic tanks on the Reservation\r\nare pumped on a periodic basis, roughly every three years, by the\r\nIndian Health Authority.  The septic sludge is ultimately disposed\r\ninto the City of San Diego's municipal wastewater system.\r\n\r\n2.4 SPECIAL WASTE PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nCEPA has initiated several special waste programs on the Reservation. \r\nThese include the junk car program and the infectious waste program,\r\nwhich are described below.\r\n\r\nSeveral Band members retain a number of cars near their homes.  These\r\ncars are used for a variety of purposes including maintenance as a\r\nhobby, a supply of spare parts, etc.  Many of the cars are in\r\ndisrepair and are not available for their intended purpose.  CEPA has\r\ninitiated a junk car program to aid Band members in the disposal of\r\nthe derelict cars.\r\n\r\nCEPA has contacted of a number of salvage companies to inquire about\r\noptions for the disposal of the derelict cars on the Reservation. \r\nMost of the salvage companies contacted offer free pick-up service,\r\nregardless of distance, if the derelict cars are of some value.  If\r\nthe salvage company deems the cars \"valueless\"  upon arrival, a charge\r\nper car (roughly $75) could be incurred.  Companies such as Ecology\r\nAuto Wrecking and Wrecks-R-Us have indicated interest in the derelict\r\ncars.  At such time as CEPA desires, these companies will arrange a\r\nsite visit to set up procedures for removing the existing derelict\r\ncars and to arrange for future disposition of abandoned and derelict\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\nThe medical clinic at the Campo Tribal Hall generates roughly 10 to 20\r\npounds of waste each month.  This waste is legally classified as\r\nmedical waste according to California laws (California Health and\r\nSafety Code, Division 20, Chapter 6.1, Section 25023.2).  It is picked\r\nup on a monthly basis by B.F.I.  Medical Waste Systems of San Diego\r\n(EPA ID No.  CAD980891378) which disposes of the waste in the County\r\nLandfill at Miramar after treating it by steam sterilization.\r\n\r\nOther special waste programs that may be initiated in the future\r\ninclude waste oil recycling and tire collections.  Current options for\r\nthe disposal of waste oil are discussed in Section 6.\r\n\r\n2.5 SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that 55 tons of solid waste, mainly residential, is\r\ngenerated on the Campo Indian Reservation each year.  A large\r\npercentage of this waste is of material that may be recycled.  The\r\nsource reduction and special waste programs on the Reservation are\r\ndesigned to reduce the amount of generated waste that is ultimately\r\ndisposed in sanitary landfills, both to increase landfill life and to\r\nkeep restricted wastes from sanitary landfills; to comply with\r\nrequirements for solid waste storage, and disposal;  and to create\r\naesthetic improvements.\r\n\r\nSeveral source reduction and special waste programs are in place such\r\nas recycling of household-generated glass, metal, and paper, and the\r\ntreatment of infectious waste generated by the medical clinic.  The\r\ngoals for these programs are to maintain and improve them such as by\r\naiding the household recycling program by offering a more convenient\r\nmethod for recycling.\r\n\r\nSource reduction and special waste programs that are not yet in place\r\ninclude the waste oil recycling program and the office-generated paper\r\nrecycling program.  Goals for these programs are to recycle 50 percent\r\nof the waste oil and office paper generated on the Reservation by Fall\r\n1991.\r\n\r\n                                  2-13\r\n\r\n                               SECTION 3\r\n         SOLID WASTE STORAGE, COLLECTION, AND TRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\nStorage, collection and transportation of solid waste generated on the\r\nReservation is regulated by CEPA pursuant in Part 510 of the Solid\r\nWaste Regulations.  Waste storage must be sanitary, removal of waste\r\nmust be efficient and safe, and waste storage containers must be\r\nmaintained.  Solid waste may not be allowed to remain in storage for\r\nmore than seven days except when:  disruptions due to strikes occur;\r\nsevere weather conditions or other natural events make collection\r\nimpossible using normal collection equipment;  or official holidays\r\ninterrupt the normal seven-day collection cycle, in which case\r\ncollection may be postponed until the next working day.  This section\r\nprovides current conditions for solid waste storage, collection, and\r\ntransportation and CEPA's goals for these aspects of solid waste\r\nmanagement\r\n\r\n3.1 SOLID WASTE STORAGE\r\n\r\nAt present, solid waste generated on the Reservation is accumulated at\r\nthe place of generation, namely individual residences or the Tribal\r\nHall.  Containers at residences are provided by individuals; there are\r\nseveral oversized bins located at the parking lot near the Tribal Hall.\r\n\r\nCEPA will provide storage bins with capacity enough for Reservation\r\nresidents to dispose of their weekly generated household refuse.  The\r\nstorage bins will be placed at a designated area near the Tribal Hall.\r\nCEPA will also provide information on sanitary storage at individual\r\nresidences.\r\n\r\nLitter\r\n\r\nThe CEPA Solid Waste Regulations prohibit littering.  Littering is\r\ndefined as the conscious or unconscious act of discarding any object\r\nat a place other than a lawful intermediate or final disposal\r\nfacility.  Litter damages the overall quality of the environment and\r\nwhen left to accumulate can pose health, fire, and safety hazards; \r\npotential air, water and visual pollution; and danger to wildlife.\r\n\r\nAlthough litter currently is not a problem on the Reservation,\r\nprevention of litter is a goal of CEPA.  Regularly maintained litter\r\nreceptacles are kept at locations of which people congregate\r\nregularly, including the Tribal Hall.  Significantly less labor is\r\nneeded to collect trash from containers than to pick it up.\r\n\r\n3.2  SOLID WASTE COLLECTION/TRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\nAt present, solid waste generated on the Reservation is transported\r\noff the Reservation site to a disposal facility by individual\r\nresidents who generate the waste.  A commercial service for the\r\ncollection of solid waste from the ___residences on the Reservation\r\nhas never been instituted; however, CEPA will institute such a service\r\nwithin a few months.\r\n\r\nCEPA will provide a weekly service to residences on the Reservation by\r\none or a combination of two methods.  CEPA will either enter into a\r\ncontract with a commercial solid waste collection company or will\r\nprovide the service from within the tribe for regular collection of\r\nsolid waste to be transported to a Class III sanitary landfill.  The\r\nselected solid waste collection service shall be established by Fall\r\n1991.\r\n\r\nLaidlaw Waste Systems is the only known commercial company that can\r\nservice the Campo area.  Laidlaw could supply the reservation with\r\nfour centrally located bins with a volume of 6 cubic yards each.  The\r\nbins would be lifted once weekly for a flat monthly service charge. \r\nLaidlaw could supply the reservation with one centrally located bin\r\nwith a volume of 40 cubic yards.  Delivery of the bin requires a\r\none-time charge and each lift has a charge.  Thirty-nine residences\r\nand the Tribal Center are estimated to generate enough solid waste to\r\nrequire a minimum of two lifts per month.\r\n\r\nA weekly solid waste collection service provided within the tribe for\r\nregular collection of solid waste is the option most favored by CEPA\r\nand the General Council.  This would entail either the purchase or\r\nlease of a collection vehicle, and the hiring of 1 or 2 people, likely\r\nCampo Band members, to perform the service on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nSan Diego County's Sycamore landfill is the closest permitted Class\r\nIII disposal facility to the Reservation.  The tribe would need to\r\nobtain a collector's permit to collect and transport solid waste\r\ngenerated on the Reservation to use County facilities.  There is an\r\ninitial permit fee of $200.00 and also a fee of $100.00 per vehicle\r\nfor inspection and decal.  The annual permit renewal fee is $25.00.\r\nThe tipping fee for the Sycamore landfill is currently $18.00 per ton;\r\nhowever, the price will increase to $23.00 per ton July 1, 1991.\r\n\r\n3.3  CONTINGENCY PLANS\r\n\r\nThis subsection describes CEPA's contingency plans for solid waste\r\nstorage, collection and transportation.  The contingency plans to\r\nprotect the public health and to comply with CEPA Solid Waste\r\nRegulations in situations that are unpredictable or unpreventable.  If\r\nsolid waste collection is not performed on a regular basis wastes\r\naccumulate, exceed storage capacity, and create both a nuisance and a\r\nhealth hazard.  Spoilage of putruscibles in uncollected waste can\r\nattract vectors and rodents which further endanger public health.\r\n\r\nLabor Disputes\r\n\r\nSolid waste collection service on the reservation will be provided by\r\ntwo (Band members) hired by CEPA.  These people would be a part-time\r\nemployees working roughly 12 hours per week.  In the event that one or\r\nboth employees could not work on a particular trash collection day the\r\nservice could be postponed one day.  Otherwise, the service may be\r\nconducted on a particular week by just one person.  CEPA should have\r\nat least one \"reserve\" person who could perform the duties in the\r\nevent that service be interrupted for more than one day.\r\n\r\nFuel Shortages\r\n\r\nCEPA is considering additional fuel storage to ensure energy supplies\r\nnecessary to perform solid waste collection.\r\n\r\nEquipment Breakdown.\r\n\r\nCEPA will provide maintenance to its vehicle(s)  to minimize the\r\nimpact of equipment breakdowns.  It may be possible to have the\r\nvehicle replaced, if leased, may be able to be replaced by the leasing\r\ncompany if it requires maintenance/repair that would exceed a few\r\ndays.  To reduce service disruption and the potential for breakdown,\r\nCEPA will ensure that the vehicle meets strict performance and safety\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n3.4 SUMMARY\r\n\r\nProper storage, collection, and transportation of solid waste\r\ngenerated on the Reservation is a high priority of CEPA.  CEPA is\r\nactively establishing service and equipment required to ensure that\r\nsolid waste storage is sanitary, littering is minimized, waste\r\ncollection is timely, and transportation of the waste to a proper\r\nfacility is efficient, safe and uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nA solid waste collection service for residents of the Reservation will\r\nbe established by Fall, 1991.\r\n\r\n                                   SECTION 4\r\n                            SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL\r\n\r\nDisposal facilities on the Reservation are regulated by CEPA pursuant\r\nto Part 530 of the Solid Waste Regulations.  The Regulations require\r\nthat disposal facilities be equipped with engineering features\r\nincluding synthetic and clay liners, leachate and gas detection and\r\ncollection systems, and cover systems that are designed to minimize\r\nand detect releases of potentially contaminants into the environment. \r\nThis section provide an evaluation of existing and future disposal\r\noptions for solid waste.\r\n\r\n4.1 OVERVIEW\r\n\r\nWaste disposal by open dumping characteristically has few or no\r\nenvironmental controls.  Solid waste management by open dumping often\r\nresults in unsanitary conditions, methane explosions, and releases of\r\nhazardous substances to surface water, ground water and the\r\natmosphere.  On the national level, old municipal landfills (former\r\nopen dumps)  make up approximately 22 percent of the hazardous waste\r\nsites on the Superfund National Priorities List.  Open dumping is\r\nprohibited on the Campo Indian Reservation.\r\n\r\nSanitary landfills are the primary method for current solid waste\r\nmanagement in the United States.  The U.S.  Environmental Protection\r\nAgency (EPA)  has estimated that about 80 percent of all solid waste\r\ngenerated in 1986 was landfilled.  Landfilling typically refers to\r\ndisposing of waste on land in a series of compacted layers and\r\ncovering it at regular intervals with tarps, soil or other materials\r\nsuch as compost.\r\n\r\nToday's sanitary landfills usually consist of a base liner of natural\r\nor synthetic material (or both).  Once a \"cell\" is excavated and the\r\nleachate collection system and liner in place, solid waste is\r\ndeposited and compacted in vertical \"lifts\" and cover is applied.  If\r\nsufficient soil is available from cell excavation, this soil is\r\nstockpiled and used for daily, intermediate and/or final cover.  If\r\nsufficient quantity and quality of soil are not available from\r\nexcavation activities, cover material would need to be imparted from\r\nan offsite \"soil borrow\" location.\r\n\r\nOn lands under the jurisdiction of the State of California, daily,\r\nintermediate, and final soil cover requirements are provided for in\r\nthe California Code of Regulations, Titles 14 and 23. Currently there\r\nare no specific federal criteria for municipal solid waste landfill\r\nfacilities.  However, the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency has\r\ndeveloped proposed minimum criteria for municipal solid waste landfill\r\nfacilities including siting; facility design (leachate collection\r\nsystems, chemical resistance of liner systems, cover systems, etc.) \r\nand operation;  ground water monitoring;  corrective action\r\nrequirements;  closure-postclosure care; and, financial\r\nresponsibilities.  These requirements will be enacted under the\r\nauthority of the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation an\r\nRecovery Act.  The final regulations have been revised based on public\r\ncomments and input from other agencies.  They are currently in the\r\nadministrative process for final approval.  The current schedule for\r\npromulgation of the final rule for municipal solid waste landfills is\r\nFall 1991.\r\n\r\nApproximately three-fourths of solid waste by weight is organic waste\r\n(e.g., paper, yard waste, and food waste) and about one-fourth is\r\ninorganic (e.g., metals and glass).  Organic wastes are biodegradable\r\nand can decompose under proper landfill conditions to produce carbon\r\ndioxide, methane, organic acids, ammonia, water, and other chemicals. \r\nIn contrast, inorganic wastes are not biodegradable and remain\r\nessentially unchanged over time.\r\n\r\nThe EPA estimates that about 80 percent of all solid waste in the\r\nUnited States was landfilled in 1986.  Moreover, EPA estimates that\r\nover 80 percent of the landfills operating in the United States in\r\n1988 will close by the year 2008.  As other methods of solid waste\r\nmanagement become more common, such as recycling and incineration,\r\nlandfills will continue to be needed to manage nonrecyclable,\r\nnoncombustible materials.\r\n\r\n4.2  EXISTING DISPOSAL FACILITIES\r\n\r\nThis subsection provides a discussion of existing disposal facilities\r\nboth on the Reservation and in San Diego County.  The information\r\nprovided will aid in the evaluation of future disposal needs.  Future\r\ndisposal needs are discussed in Section 4.3.\r\n\r\n4.2.1  Campo Indian Reservation\r\n\r\nSolid waste is generated from the approximately 28 households on the\r\nmain reservation and 11 households on the old reservation.  No formal\r\npublic or commercial solid waste collection and disposal service has\r\nbeen used to date and prior to the recent promulgation of solid waste\r\nregulations.  Until recently, individual households have disposed of\r\nsolid waste within Reservation boundaries on the main Reservation, in\r\nan area generally accepted as the \"designated disposal area.\"\r\n\r\nThe main open dump is located in a ravine alongside a road roughly 1\r\nmile north of the Tribal Center.  The ravine contains a variety of\r\nmunicipal waste including \"white goods\" (appliances), furniture,\r\ntires, and derelict cars, although the majority of the wastes were\r\ngeneral household refuse.  In addition, there are several drums, as\r\nwell as metal containers that may have originally held automotive\r\nfluids such as coolant and engine oil.  The dimensions of the disposal\r\narea are approximately 100 feet by 200 feet, with a maximum depth of 6\r\nto 8 feet.  Though no longer in use this area has been deliberately\r\nused for solid waste disposal by Reservation households for at least\r\nthe past 20 years.  The area has been deliberately burned out several\r\ntimes over the last 20 years to reduce the volume of waste.\r\n\r\nOne other open dump is located roughly 2 miles northeast of the Tribal\r\nCenter.  It had been used by one household, and is also not used any\r\nlonger.  The area is roughly 50 feet by 50 feet; the depth of the\r\nwaste is not known.\r\n\r\nSolid waste generated by households on the old Reservation is\r\ncurrently discarded by residents at a County-owned and operated\r\ntransfer station located on Buckman Springs Road (Highway S-1) \r\nimmediately north of Old Campo and roughly 0.5-miles north of Cameron\r\nComers.  This transfer station was opened in 1973;  prior to 1973\r\nsolid waste was either disposed of in a nearby landfill or disposed of\r\non the old Reservation.  No open dumps remain on the old Reservation.\r\n\r\nThe two open dumps discussed above will be closed and remediated as\r\napproved by General Council meeting of January 13, 1991. The project\r\nwill consist of the removal of the solid waste from the ravine and the\r\ntransportation of the removed material to a San Diego County Class III\r\nsolid waste disposal facility.  CEPA is committed to the remediation\r\nand the General Council will provide labor from members of the Tribe. \r\nThe possibility of purchasing or leasing a truck for the project is\r\npresently under consideration.  Backhoes and other heavy equipment\r\nwill be either borrowed or rented for the project.\r\n\r\nThe two or three derelict cars removed from the ravine will be set\r\naside and included in the junk car program (Section 2.4). In addition,\r\nany household hazardous waste found in the ravine will be set aside\r\nfor inclusion in the household hazardous waste program (Section 6).\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the removal of the solid waste, the area will be secured\r\nby constructing a fence between the ravine and the road to prevent\r\nfuture disposal of waste in the area.  In addition, samples of soil\r\nfrom the two open dump areas will be collected and transported to a\r\nlaboratory certified by the California Department of Health Services\r\nfor hazardous waste analysis.  The samples will be subjected to a\r\npriority pollutant scan.  In the event the soil samples are clean,\r\nfurther investigation will not be necessary.  If the samples indicate\r\nthe soil is contaminated, however, full site characterization will be\r\nnecessary to define the lateral and horizontal extent of the\r\ncontamination.  It would then be necessary to carry out appropriate\r\nremedial activities.\r\n\r\n4.2.2  San Diego County\r\n\r\nThere currently are eight active solid waste sanitary landfills in San\r\nDiego County.  All are Class III facilities.  Five of the eight\r\nfacilities are County landfills, one is a City landfill (Miramar)  and\r\ntwo are U.S.  Government landfills and are located at Camp Pendleton\r\nMarine Corps Base.\r\n\r\nSan Diego County generated approximately 3.1 million tons of solid\r\nwaste per year in 1985, a rate that may increase to 5.8 million tons\r\nper year by 2000.  In addition, nearly all the solid waste generated\r\nin San Diego County is disposed in sanitary landfills.  Based on\r\ncurrent disposal rates, the 8 active landfills in San Diego County\r\nhave expected \"lives\" of 9 to 10 years.\r\n\r\n4.3  FUTURE DISPOSAL NEEDS\r\n\r\nThis subsection contains an evaluation of future solid waste disposal\r\nneeds focusing on needs for disposal facility space on the Reservation\r\nand/or in San Diego County.  Solid waste generated on the Reservation\r\nis presently disposed in San Diego landfills.  This solid waste\r\nmanagement technique may continue into the future or a solid waste\r\ndisposal facility may be constructed on the Reservation.\r\n\r\nCalifornia law requires that each county prepare plans that achieve a\r\n25 percent diversion of all solid waste from landfills by January 1,\r\n1995, and 50 percent diversion of all solid waste by January 1, 2000. \r\nCEPA is committed to achieve this goal for waste generated on the\r\nReservation primarily through source reduction, recycling, and special\r\nwaste programs described in Section 2 of the CEPA Solid Waste\r\nManagement Plan.\r\n\r\n4.3.1  Campo Indian Reservation\r\n\r\nSolid waste presently generated on the Reservation, estimated to be\r\nroughly 55 tons each year, is disposed of in San Diego landfills.  The\r\nfuture disposal needs for the Reservation can be thought of as the\r\nspace required for the solid waste generated on the Reservation in the\r\nfuture, minus the amount that is either recycled or treated.\r\n\r\nFor example, if 75 tons of solid,waste is generated on the Reservation\r\nin the year 2000, and 15 tons of this waste is recycled and none is\r\ntreated, there is a need for landfill space for 60 tons of solid waste\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\nNo active disposal facilities are located on the Reservation at the\r\npresent time.  A discussion of potential sites for solid waste\r\ndisposal facilities on the Reservation is provided in Section 4.4.\r\n\r\n4.3.2  San Diego County\r\n\r\nThe future disposal needs for San Diego County can be thought of as\r\nthe space required for the amount of solid waste generated in the\r\nCounty in the future, estimated to be between 3 million and 6 million\r\ntons per year by the year 2000, minus the space required for the\r\namount of solid waste that is either recycled or treated.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Southwest San Diego County Solid Waste Facility\r\nSiting Study prepared by the City and County of San Diego and dated\r\nOctober 6, 1990, the disposal volume (landfill space) required for the\r\nsouthwest corner of the county over the next 30 years is estimated to\r\nbe 270 million cubic yards.  The southwest area of the county is\r\ngenerally bounded by the Mexican border to the south, Campo to the\r\nsoutheast, Julian to the northeast, and Escondido to the north.  The\r\n270 million cubic yard value does not include the disposal needs of\r\nSan Diego County outside the southwest area of the County over the\r\nnext 30 years.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a proposed landfill in Campo, the City and County of\r\nSan Diego have proposed nine possible sites for a solid waste disposal\r\nfacility to replace the currently operating Miramar, Sycamore and Otay\r\nlandfills, all of which are expected to close within a decade. \r\nAccording to the Southwest San Diego County Solid Waste Facility\r\nSiting Study prepared by the City and County of San Diego, (1990), the\r\nnine solid waste sites being considered are as follows:\r\n\r\n        1.  Oak Canyon, located north of planned State Route 52, south\r\n            and east of Miramar Naval Air Station, west of the\r\n            existing Sycamore Landfill, in the City of San Diego.\r\n\r\n        2.  East Otay Mesa, located approximately 9 miles east of\r\n            Interstate 805, within 0.25 mile of the Mexican border.\r\n\r\n        3.  Long Valley, located approximately 2 miles north of\r\n            Interstate 8, and 1 mile east of Corte Madera Road.\r\n\r\n        4.  Unnamed Canyon west of Dulzura, located in a canyon\r\n            immediately south of State Route 94, about 1 mile west of\r\n            Dulaura.\r\n\r\n        5.  Marron Valley, located approximately 3 miles south of\r\n            Engineer Springs and 0.5 mile north of the Mexican border.\r\n\r\n        6.  Upper Sycamore Canyon, located in the northern reaches of\r\n            Sycamore Canyon northeast of the Miramar Air Station.\r\n\r\n        7.  Wolf Canyon, located just east of and adjacent to the\r\n            existing Otay Landfill.\r\n\r\n        8.  North Otay Valley, located approximately 4 miles\r\n            east-southeast of Wolf Canyon.\r\n\r\n        9.  Del Mar Mesa.\r\n\r\n4.4  POTENTIAL SITES FOR SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES\r\n\r\nThis section provides a discussion of potential sites for solid waste\r\ndisposal facilities on the Reservation.  The rationale of including an\r\narea as a potential site for solid waste disposal facility is based on\r\nthe natural characteristics of individual sites on the Reservation and\r\non siting criteria mandated by various environmental agencies.  Siting\r\ncriteria of the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, the California\r\nWater Resources Control Board, the California Integrated Waste\r\nManagement Board, and the Campo Band of Mission Indians is discussed\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n4.4.1 Siting Criteria\r\n\r\n4.4.1.1 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\r\n\r\nThe existing U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency's Regulations on\r\nCriteria for Classification of Solid Waste Disposal Facilities and\r\nPractices (40 CFR 257)  states the following:\r\n\r\nSection 257.3-1 Floodplains.\r\n\r\n       (a)  Facilities or practices in floodplains shall not restrict\r\n            the flow of the base flood, reduce the temporary water\r\n            storage capacity of the floodplain, or result in washout\r\n            of solid waste, so as to pose a hazard to human life,\r\n            wildlife, or land or water resources.\r\n\r\n       (b)  As used in this section:\r\n\r\n            (1)  \"Base flood\" means a flood that has a 1 percent or\r\n                 greater chance of recurring in any year or a flood of\r\n                 a magnitude equalled or exceeded once in 100 years on\r\n                 the average over a significantly long period.\r\n\r\n            (2)  \"Floodplain\" means the lowland and relatively flat\r\n                 areas adjoining inland and coastal waters, including\r\n                 flood-prone areas of offshore islands, which are\r\n                 inundated by the base flood.\r\n\r\n            (3)  \"Washout\" means the carrying away of solid waste by\r\n                 waters of the base flood.\r\n\r\nSection 257.3-2 Endangered species.\r\n\r\n       (a)  Facilities or practices shall not cause or contribute to\r\n            the taking of any endangered or threatened species of\r\n            plants, fish, or wildlife.\r\n\r\n       (b)  The facility or practice shall not result in the\r\n            destruction or adverse modification of the critical\r\n            habitat of endangered or threatened species as identified\r\n            in 50 CFR Part 17.\r\n\r\n       (c)  As used in this section:\r\n\r\n            (1)  \"Endangered or threatened species\" means any species\r\n                 listed as such pursuant to Section 4 of the\r\n                 Endangered Species Act.\r\n\r\n            (2)  \"Destruction or adverse modification\"  means a direct\r\n                 or indirect alteration of critical habitat which\r\n                 appreciably diminishes the likelihood of the survival\r\n                 and recovery of threatened or endangered species\r\n                 using that habitat.\r\n\r\n            (3)  \"Taking\"  means harassing, harming, pursuing,\r\n                 hunting, wounding, killing, trapping, capturing, or\r\n                 collecting or attempting to engage in such conduct.\r\n\r\nSection 257.3-3 Surface Water.\r\n\r\n[257.3-3 (a) and (b) amended by 47 FR 47051.

For prior\r\n    history, see Register 78, No. 30.\r\n\r\nSection 17628. General Design Parameters.\r\n\r\n        Each site design shall be based on appropriate data regarding\r\nthe service area, anticipated nature and quantity of wastes to be\r\nreceived, climatological factors, physical setting, adjacent land use\r\n(existing and planned), types and numbers of vehicles anticipated to\r\nenter the site, ground and surface water, leachate control, soils,\r\ndrainage, provisions for monitoring, venting, controlling and possible\r\nuse of landfill decomposition gas and other pertinent information.  If\r\nthe site is to be used by the general public, the design shall take\r\naccount of features which may be needed to accommodate such public use.\r\n\r\nThe California Waste Management Board (CWMB)  expresses siting\r\nsuggestions in \"A Comprehensive Plan for Management of Nonhazardous\r\nWaste in California, 1985.\"  The suggestions for a landfill are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n        o   Landfills should be out of view of schools, businesses and\r\n            residences.\r\n\r\n        o   Refuse trucks and other vehicles using the landfill should\r\n            not pass through residential neighborhoods on their way to\r\n            the facility.\r\n\r\n        o   Land on which the disposal site is operated should be\r\n            properly zoned and compatible with other surrounding uses.\r\n\r\n        o   Sufficient space should be set aside as a buffer zone\r\n            between the proposed landfill and current or future\r\n            residential developments.\r\n\r\n        o   Landfills should be located in areas which are\r\n            unattractive for commercial, agricultural, or residential\r\n            use when at all possible.\r\n\r\n        o   Facilities should not be located in a floodplain or\r\n            anywhere else where surface or ground-water contamination\r\n            is a risk.\r\n\r\n        o   Landfills should never be located near an airport due to\r\n            the danger of birds attracted to the disposal site\r\n            interfering with aircraft.\r\n\r\n        o   Landfills should not be sited in the habitats of\r\n            endangered species.\r\n\r\n        o   Landfills should not be located in seismically-active\r\n            areas.\r\n\r\n        o   Facilities should avoid areas close to sources of ground\r\n            or surface water pollution.\r\n\r\n        o   There should be adequate cover material of low\r\n            permeability available nearby.\r\n\r\n        o   Landfills should not be located near noise- or\r\n            odor-sensitive areas.\r\n\r\n        o   Landfills should be close enough to the service area to\r\n            keep down transportation costs and energy consumption.\r\n\r\n        o   If a landfill must be located near residences or other\r\n            developments, landfill gas control devices should be\r\n            included in the facility design.\r\n\r\n        o   Close-in landfills should also be designed with proper\r\n            noise attenuation devices (e.g., natural barriers such as\r\n            ridges or berms).\r\n\r\n4.4.1.4  Campo Band of Mission Indians\r\n\r\nCriteria applicable to solid waste disposal facility siting are\r\nprovided in the Tribal Environmental Policy Act of 1990 and Solid\r\nWaste Management Code of 1990.  The Environmental Policy Act and Solid\r\nWaste Management Code addresses the following issues:\r\n\r\n         a. Land use adjacent to or near the solid waste facility\r\n            shall be compatible.\r\n\r\n         b. The quality ground water, surface water and air quality\r\n            shall be protected.\r\n\r\n         c. Geography, geology, climate and hydrology shall be\r\n            characterized.\r\n\r\n         d. Population density, distribution shall be addressed.\r\n\r\n         e. The waste constituents and generation rates shall be\r\n            considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nA non-hazardous solid waste landfill (Class III)  and surface\r\nimpoundment of leachate (Class H) for construction by an outside\r\nvendor on the reservation are proposed.  The waste management strategy\r\nfor the surface impoundment should be one of full containment, while\r\nthe waste management strategy for the non-hazardous solid waste\r\nlandfill is one of protecting beneficial uses (Table 4-1) (Title 23).\r\n\r\n4.4.2  Potential Disposal Facility Sites\r\n\r\nAreas that are not suitable for the location of a Class II or Class\r\nIII solid waste disposal facility on the Reservation are readily\r\nidentified.  Areas are delineated as unsuitable if one or more of the\r\nsiting criteria (outlined in Section 4.4. 1) are not satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn the northern portion of the Campo Reservation, a major block of\r\nland (T175, R6E, Sections 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15)  is\r\nunsuitable for a disposal facility (Figure 4-1).  This area does not\r\nhave adequate topography to conceal a disposal facility.  This area is\r\nlocated near residences, the town of Live Oaks Springs, and\r\nground-water supply wells.\r\n\r\nThe area of T185/R6E, Section 5, 9, 16, and 17 in the southwestern\r\nportion of the Campo Reservation is not suitable because of topography\r\nconstraints (Figure 4-1).  All these sections are located on uplands\r\nand would be in clear view of local residences.  In addition,\r\nexcavating an area without the advantage of a pre-existing valley\r\nwould result in greater cost.\r\n\r\nIn the same southwestern area of the Campo Reservation, T185/R6E in\r\nSection 4 is also unsuitable for disposal facility location (Figure\r\n4-1).  A disposal facility in this area would be located near\r\nresidences and block surface water flow on a creek.  This valley\r\nappears to be located along a regional cooling joint that may be a\r\nmajor conduit for ground-water flow.\r\n\r\nAn area in the middle of the Campo Reservation (T175/R6E, Sections 20,\r\n22, 27, 28, 33, and 34) is considered an unsuitable location for\r\nsiting a solid waste disposal facility because of various violations\r\nof siting criteria.  Sections 20, 27, 33 and 34 are located on\r\ntopographic uplands and Sections 33 and 34 contain several residences,\r\na highway, and a cemetery.  Section 22 is located in an upper valley,\r\nand several residences are located directly to the north.  Section 28\r\nis unsuitable because of the presence of a significant stream valley\r\nand a spring.  Filling this valley could adversely affect ground water\r\nand would block surface-water flow.  Also this stream course lies\r\nalong a regional cooling joint that may which could represent a\r\nground-water conduit.\r\n\r\nTABLE 4-1:  MODIFIED SUMMARY OF WASTE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR\r\n            DISCHARGES OF WASTE TO LAND AS REQUIRED BY CALIFORNIA\r\n            WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD SEE HARD COPY\r\n\r\nWith these areas eliminated, five possible solid waste disposal\r\nfacility sites exist.  Site-specific geologic and hydrogeologic\r\nstudies are needed to further delineate the acceptability of these\r\nsites, listed below.\r\n\r\n       1.  T175/R6E, Section 21 is located along an upper stream\r\n           valley.  Concerns in this area include the location of a\r\n           spring downstream and the ground-water control of the\r\n           regional joint in the stream valley.\r\n\r\n       2.  T175/R6E, Section 29, and 32 are located north of Highway\r\n           94.  This upper tributary valley exists north of the San\r\n           Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway.  Concerns in this area\r\n           are the possible visual impacts along Highway 94 and the\r\n           strong joint trend that may be a ground-water conduit.\r\n\r\n       3.  T185/R6E, Section 3 is located south of Highway 94 and\r\n           south of Campo Creek.  This upper tributary valley may be\r\n           located too close to residences, and may be in view of\r\n           Highway 94 and St.  Carmel Cemetery.\r\n\r\n       4.  T185/R6E, Sections 8, 9 and 16 may be a possible disposal\r\n           facility location.  The disposal facility could be located\r\n           in a deep upper tributary valley.  Concerns for this area\r\n           include the regional joint that underlies the stream\r\n           valley, which could be a major ground-water conduit.  There\r\n           may not be adequate room for a disposal facility.\r\n\r\n       5.  T185/R6E, Sections 10 and 15 represent a possible solid\r\n           waste disposal facility location in an upper tributary\r\n           valley.  This location is in a U-shaped curve of the San\r\n           Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway.\r\n\r\n4.5 COMPLETED LANDFILLS\r\n\r\nThere are no completed landfills on the Campo Indian Reservation.\r\n\r\n4.6 SUMMARY\r\n\r\nBased on current solid waste generation rates and programs inplace to\r\nreduce or recycle solid waste, there is a need for disposal space for\r\nthe solid waste generated on the Reservation.  There presently are no\r\nactive solid waste disposal facilities on the Reservation.  Two\r\ninactive disposal facilities (open dumps)  is located approximately 1\r\nmile north of the Tribal Hall; however, they do not meet disposal\r\nfacility standards imposed by the CEPA Solid Waste Regulations, and\r\nmust be remediated by Fall 1991.\r\n\r\nSolid waste generated on the Reservation is disposed in San Diego City\r\nor County landfills.  There is available space in the eight active\r\nlandfills, but if these landfills are not expanded and no new\r\nlandfills are constructed, it is estimated that space will be depleted\r\nby the year 2000.  The County of San Diego has proposed 10 possible\r\nsites for the construction of a future solid waste disposal facility; \r\nthe Campo Indian Reservation is one of the 10 sites.\r\n\r\nFive potential locations on the Campo Indian Reservation have been\r\nidentified as possible locations for the construction of a solid waste\r\ndisposal facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION 5\r\n             RESOURCE RECOVERY PROCESSING AND REUSE\r\n\r\nRecycling facilities and composting facilities on the Reservation are\r\nregulated by CEPA pursuant to Parts 520 and 540 of the Solid Waste\r\nRegulations.  Recycling and composting operations are described in\r\nthis section, as well as other resource recovery technologies.  These\r\ntechnologies are evaluated for their appropriateness for the\r\nReservation with consideration of environmental concerns, as well as\r\navailable and future markets for material, and energy resources\r\nrecovered from the solid waste.\r\n\r\n5.1 OVERVIEW\r\n\r\nResource recovery is any process that reclaims energy or materials\r\nfrom solid waste.  Recovery of materials such as metals, glass, paper,\r\nsewage sludge, non-ferrous metals and oil may be accomplished by\r\nseparation at the source or at municipal processing plants.  Energy\r\nand nutrients can be extracted and used or re-used.  Recovering\r\nresources from solid waste saves landfill space, saves virgin\r\nresources, and decreases threats to the environment posed by\r\nlandfilling of solid waste.\r\n\r\nThe use of solid waste resource recovery technologies does not\r\nalleviate the need for disposal options; portions of a solid waste\r\nstream cannot be treated or recycled.  In addition, treatment\r\ntechnologies often contain byproducts such as ash from incineration\r\nthat must then be landfilled.\r\n\r\n5.2 IDENTIFICATION OF TYPES OF RESOURCE RECOVERY FACILITIES\r\n\r\nThis section identifies types of resource recovery facilities and\r\nresource conservation systems appropriate for the Campo Indian\r\nReservation.  Considerations for the identification of types of\r\nresource recovery and conservation facilities are environmental\r\nconcerns; available and future markets for material and energy\r\nresources recovered from solid waste; and methods for conserving such\r\nmaterials and energy.\r\n\r\nRecycling\r\n\r\nA description of present and future recycling efforts for residential\r\nand office waste generated on the Reservation is provided in Section\r\n2.3.  Recycling a portion of these waste streams is appropriate for\r\nthe Campo Indian Reservation.\r\n\r\nRecycling of paper, metal, glass, and plastics from municipal waste\r\nstreams, including residential, commercial, industrial and\r\ninstitutional waste streams, is a viable and important resource\r\nrecovery effort.  Recycling is most efficient when conducted at the\r\nsource of generation.  There are markets available for recycled\r\nmaterial and there is relatively little capital required in comparison\r\nto treatment technologies such as incineration.  Recycling in addition\r\nto solid waste treatment technologies will enhance the treatment\r\ntechnology, i.e. composting and incineration are more efficient when\r\nglass, plastics, and metals are removed from the waste stream.\r\n\r\nComposting\r\n\r\nComposting refers to the process of biological decomposition of solid\r\norganic materials by microorganisms, mainly bacteria and fungi.  The\r\ndecomposition process must be properly designed and controlled.  To\r\nmaximize the rate of microbial activity within a mass of organic\r\nmaterial, factors such as temperature, moisture, nutrients, oxygen,\r\nand pH must be controlled.  With proper controls, composting can occur\r\nrapidly, yield a product that meets end-use quality specifications,\r\nand reduces the original volume by more than 50 percent.  \"Compost\" is\r\nthe stabilized, humus-  or soil-like product.  The final compost\r\nproducts may be used for a variety of purposes e.g., to help improve\r\nsoil structure.\r\n\r\nComposting can be accomplished by such procedures as aerated static\r\npile, windrow, in-vessel, aerated windrow, static pile (essentially a\r\nwindrow that does not get turned), and vericomposting.  Composting may\r\nbe a solid waste management technique for waste streams of yard waste\r\nonly, municipal wastewater sludge only, or unseparated solid waste\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nYard waste often constitutes 10 to 30 percent or more of a typical\r\nurban residential waste stream.  Composting is viewed as a preferred\r\nyard waste management technique over landfilling and incineration\r\nSeveral states (not including California)  have enacted bans on the\r\ndisposal of yard waste into sanitary landfills.\r\n\r\nComposting of municipal wastewater sludge has become an accepted\r\noption for sludge management.  Yard waste such as leaves, grass\r\nclippings, brush, tree trimmings, etc., can be used as part (or all)\r\nof the bulking agent/amendment in the sludge composting operation.\r\n\r\nComposting of an unseparated waste stream encompasses the entire\r\norganic and/or biodegradable fraction of the solid waste stream.  The\r\nend product can vary depending on the quality of the waste to be\r\ncomposted and the process used.\r\n\r\nWaste to Energy\r\n\r\nWaste to energy facilities include methane recovery and incineration,\r\nboth of which are more efficient if recycling and source separation is\r\nconducted in conjunction with the waste to energy process.  Methane\r\ngas emitted from the anaerobic biodegradation of organic materials in\r\nsolid waste can be captured and used for energy.  The gas can be used\r\nas an alternative to natural gas.\r\n\r\nIncineration of solid waste is conducted by three basic processes. \r\nSteam can be generated from incineration facilities and used for\r\nelectricity.  Incineration can reduce the waste volume by 80 to 95%\r\nand is the most effective method known for reducing waste volumes. \r\nIncineration, or mass burn, is also highly controversial, especially\r\nin the State of California.  Particular concerns have been raised\r\nabout possible health effects associated with air emissions and the\r\nash component of the residue.  Mass burn systems are large facilities\r\n(usually over 200 tons per day) that burn mixed solid waste. \r\nRefuse-derived fuel (RDF)  systems generally are large facilities that\r\nprocess solid waste into a more homogeneous fuel that is then burned. \r\nTogether, mass burn and RDF systems account for about 90 percent of\r\ncurrent and planned solid waste incineration capacity in the United\r\nStates (OTA, 1989).  Some smaller modular systems also burn\r\nunprocessed solid waste; they usually consist of modules manufactured\r\nat a factory and assembled onsite.  Other processes such as pyrolysis\r\nand fluidized bed combustion are also used.  At this time, only 3\r\nsolid waste incineration facilities are operating in the State of\r\nCalifornia: one in the City of Long Beach; one in the City of\r\nCommerce; and, one in the town of Westley (tire burning only).\r\n\r\n5.3 EXISTING RESOURCE RECOVERY FACILITIES\r\n\r\nThis subsection provides a discussion of existing resource recovery\r\nfacilities both on the Reservation and in San Diego County.  The\r\ninformation provided in this subsection will aid in the evaluation of\r\nfuture resource recovery needs, provided in Section 5.4 below.\r\n\r\n5.3.1 Campo Indian Reservation\r\n\r\nAt present, there are no existing solid waste resource recovery\r\nfacilities within the Reservation.\r\n\r\n5.3.2 San Diego County\r\n\r\nThe large-scale resource recovery operations in San Diego County\r\n(i.e., not including such operations as individual composting\r\nfacilities)  are recycling operations.  County recycling centers and\r\ncurbside programs are available in most parts of the County. \r\nMaterials that can be recycled include aluminum cans, aluminum scrap,\r\nnonferrous metal, newspaper, other paper, cardboard, California glass,\r\nglass, California redemption value plastic, plastic, batteries, yard\r\ntrimmings and lumber, furniture and appliances, magazines, mattresses,\r\narts and crafts supplies, books, clothing, housewares, and phone books.\r\n\r\n5.4 FUTURE RESOURCE RECOVERY NEEDS\r\n\r\nThis subsection contains an evaluation of future solid waste resource\r\nrecovery needs.  The evaluation focuses on needs for facilities on the\r\nReservation and/or in San Diego County.  Solid waste generated on the\r\nReservation is presently disposed in San Diego landfills.  The\r\nutilization of resource recovery facilities will aid in the achieving\r\nof a 25 percent diversion of all solid waste from landfills by January\r\n1, 1995, and 50 percent diversion by January 1, 2000.\r\n\r\n5.4.1 Campo Indian Reservation\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that approximately 70 tons of solid waste will be\r\ngenerated on the Reservation in 1995, and 80 tons of solid waste will\r\nbe generated on the Reservation in the year 2000.  A 25 percent\r\ndiversion in 1995 and a 50 percent diversion in 2000 result in the\r\nneed for approximately 17.5 tons per year of either solid waste\r\nrecycling or treatment by 1995, and 40 tons per year by the year 2000.\r\n\r\n5.4.2 San Diego County\r\n\r\nBased on projected waste generation rates in the County, it is\r\nestimated that between 3.3 million and 5.4 million tons of solid waste\r\nwill be generated in the County in 1995, and between 3.5 million and\r\n5.8 millon tons of solid waste will be generated in the County in the\r\nyear 2000.  A 25 percent diversion in 1995 and a 50 percent diversion\r\nin 2000 results in the need for between 0.8 million and 1.35 million\r\ntons per year of either solid waste recycling or treatment in 1995,\r\nand between 1.75 million and 2.9 million tons per year by the year\r\n2000.\r\n\r\n5.5 POTENTIAL SITES FOR RESOURCE RECOVERY FACILITIES\r\n\r\nThis section provides a discussion of potential sites for solid waste\r\nresource recovery facilities on the Reservation.\r\n\r\n5.5.1 Siting Criteria for Resource Recovery Facilities\r\n\r\nThere are few regulatory criteria established for siting solid waste\r\nresource recovery facilities.  The California Integrated Waste\r\nManagement Board addresses concerns for siting composting operations. \r\nThese criteria include required storage area, noise, aesthetics, fire\r\nhazards, odor, prevention of degrading ground water, prevention of\r\ndegrading surface water, increased traffic and litter (CWMB 1985). \r\nThe facility should not be located on a floodplain or interrupt\r\nsurface water flow.  In addition, the facility should not be located\r\non or near an active fault\r\n\r\n5.5.2 Potential Siting Areas\r\n\r\nThere are obvious areas not suitable for the location of a solid waste\r\nresource recovery facility on the Reservation.  These unsuitable sites\r\ninclude areas near residences and major stream floodplains.  Hence, a\r\nfacility should not be located in the stream channel of Campo Creek or\r\nmajor tributaries.  In addition, a facility should also not be located\r\non an active fault, not a siting consideration because there are no\r\nknown active faults located on the Reservation.\r\n\r\nThe siting of a solid waste resource recovery facility (not including\r\nincineration)  should not create significant problems, and such a\r\nfacility could be located in some part of most regions of the\r\nReservation.  Primary factors in locating a resource recycling\r\nfacility therefore are the proximity to transportation routes and\r\naesthetics.\r\n\r\n5.6 SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrent solid waste generation rates create the need for technologies\r\nto replace the singular reliance on landfilling.  Solid waste contains\r\nenergy and materials that can be reused;  a responsible society will\r\nharvest and extract these resources.  There presently are no active\r\nsolid waste resource recovery facilities on the Reservation because\r\nCounty programs are accessible and the amount of waste generated on\r\nthe Reservation considered alone does not make such an effort feasible.\r\n\r\nThe siting of resource recovery facility on the Campo Reservation to\r\nmeet the need of San Diego County is a possibility and potential\r\nsiting areas are available.  A recycling or composting facility on the\r\nReservation would be required to adhere to the CEPA Solid Waste\r\nRegulations, and would recycle at least 25 percent of the solid waste\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SECTION 6\r\n                       HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE\r\n\r\nHousehold hazardous waste includes cleaners, pesticides, paint\r\nproducts, automotive products, hobby products, and other toxic\r\nsubstances commonly found in residences.  When these hazardous\r\nmaterials are disposed of improperly in the municipal refuse system,\r\nrisk of solid waste landfill contamination, water pollution, and\r\ninjury to refuse workers and landfill operators exists.  Table 6-1\r\nprovides examples of hazardous ingredients in common household\r\ncommodities.\r\n\r\nA number of sources provide various estimates on the amount of\r\nhousehold hazardous waste that comprises a \"typical\"  residential\r\nwaste stream.  The Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan\r\npresents a figure of 0.13 to 0.15 percent;  a study conducted by\r\nStanford Research Institute for the California Waste Management Board\r\nresulted in a finding of between .0.29 and 0.59 percent;  and a 1987\r\nU.S.  Environmental Protection Agency studies revealed a finding of\r\nbetween 0.35 and 0.40 percent of a typical residential waste stream is\r\ncategorized as household hazardous waste.  These percentages applied\r\nto San Diego County waste volumes predict that as much as 8,360 tons\r\nof household hazardous waste per year is generated in San Diego County.\r\n\r\nExtrapolating these figures for the 55 tons per year of solid waste\r\ngenerated on the Reservation, it is estimated that approximate 400\r\npounds of household hazardous waste is currently generated on the\r\nReservation each year.  This number may increase in the future as\r\npopulation increases, waste generation rates increase, or the\r\npercentage of household hazardous waste in the solid waste streams on\r\nthe Reservation increases.\r\n\r\nThere currently is not a comprehensive household hazardous waste\r\nprogram for hazardous wastes generated on the Reservation by\r\nhouseholds.  Individual households have the personal responsibility\r\nfor properly disposing of hazardous wastes.  Until a Reservation-wide\r\npick up or collection service is implemented, household hazardous\r\nwastes can be disposed through the San Diego County program, discussed\r\nin the following paragraphs.  Additional information on the program\r\nincluding the location, dates and times, and procedures for current\r\nand future drop-off points for household hazardous waste can be\r\nobtained by contacting the San Diego County Department of Health\r\nServices (DHS)  at 619/338-2222.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 6-1:  EXAMPLES OF HAZARDOUS INGREDIENTS IN COMMON HOUSEHOLD\r\n            COMMODITIES - SEE HARD COPY\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 6-1:  EXAMPLES OF HAZARDOUS INGREDIENTS IN COMMON HOUSEHOLD\r\n            COMMODITIES-CONTINUED - SEE HARD COPY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe DHS has administered the Household Hazardous Materials Program\r\nsince 1983.  The program has two primary purposes:\r\n\r\n        1. Provide long-term community education programs about\r\n           household hazardous wastes.\r\n\r\n        2. Provide convenient disposal alternatives for household\r\n           hazardous waste for all San Diego County residents.\r\n\r\nThe community education programs in the County include the\r\ndistribution of literature to schools, retail, public service and\r\ngovernment locations; providing education programs for refuse\r\ncollectors; and the promotion of safe and effective substitutes for\r\nhazardous materials commonly used in households.  Currently, the\r\nCounty DHS offers residents of San Diego County three disposal\r\nalternatives for household hazardous wastes:\r\n\r\n        1. A drop-off location in Chula Vista.\r\n        2. A specially arranged pick-up for elderly and disabled\r\n           residents\r\n        3. A regional collection events held throughout the year.\r\n\r\nAppropriate Technologies II, a licensed hazardous waste handling firm,\r\noperates a household hazardous waste collection center at its\r\nhazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facility in Chula\r\nVista.  In addition, Appropriate Technologies II provides a pick-up\r\nservice by request for elderly and disabled residents.  In\r\ncoordination with the County DHS, Appropriate Technologies II also\r\nstaffs special events at various locations in the County throughout\r\nthe year in order to provide convenient disposal alternatives to San\r\nDiego County residents.  The types of household hazardous waste that\r\nhave been collected through the County's program include paints, waste\r\noil, pesticides, corrosives, flammables, and oxidizers.\r\n\r\nThe San Diego County Household Hazardous Materials Program is planned\r\nto expand in the future to include solid waste transfer stations and\r\nregional household hazardous waste collection centers.  Solid waste\r\ntransfer stations will provide a mechanism to segregate solid waste\r\nstreams into recyclables, household hazardous waste, and those wastes\r\nsuitable for sanitary landfills.  In addition, five to seven more\r\nRegional Collection Centers for household hazardous wastes may be\r\navailable to residents of San Diego County in the next few years.\r\n\r\nThe improper disposal of used motor oil is a serious environmental\r\nproblem.  Used motor oil should not be disposed with municipal solid\r\nwastes, but should be taken to a service station that accepts and\r\nrecycles the oil.  Used motor oil can be dropped off through either\r\nthe County DHS Household Hazardous Materials Program, or can be\r\nbrought to a service station through the County Public Works\r\nDepartment's Recycling program.  There are two used motor oil drop off\r\npoints in the eastern portion of San Diego County.  Chief Auto Parts\r\nat 710 Jamacha Boulevard in El Cajon (619/444-3397) accepts used motor\r\noil, with a 5-gallon limit.  A Chevron service station at 5600\r\nBaltimore Drive in La Mesa (619/463-1615) also accepts used motor oil\r\nand does not impose a limit.  The San Diego County Recycling Program\r\nHotline for additional information on used motor oil recycling is\r\n619/270-8189 or 1-800-237-2583.\r\n\r\n                                   SECTION 7\r\n                      EDUCATION AND PUBLIC INFORMATION\r\n\r\nTo meet the goals of this Solid Waste Management Plan, CEPA has\r\nestablished an education and public information program.  This program\r\nseeks to increase public awareness of and participation in recycling,\r\nsource reduction, litter prevention, and household hazardous waste\r\nprograms.  CEPA's education and public information program focuses on\r\nawareness, publicity and convenience.\r\n\r\nAwareness of the importance of proper solid waste management at the\r\nsource is a major asset in recycling, source reduction, litter\r\nprevention, and household hazardous waste programs.  As these programs\r\nrequire the public to alter their habits, providing an awareness of\r\nthe manner in which their habits can affect the environment can\r\nincrease participation.\r\n\r\nPublicity in the form of education and promotional campaigns is also a\r\ncritical aspect of CEPA's programs.  Containers for recyclables will\r\nbe clearly labeled as designated for specific recycle categories of\r\nwaste materials such as glass and aluminum.  Clearly labeling these\r\ncontainers will facilitate recycling and raise public awareness of\r\nsource separation options.  In addition, exhibits, posters, and short\r\narticles may urge the public to make source separation and recycling a\r\nway of life, and provide enthusiasm for the programs.  For example,\r\npublicizing in the Tribal Hall that every ton of recycled paper saves\r\n9.9 cubic feet of landfill space and 17 trees will encourage office\r\npaper recycling.\r\n\r\nConvenience plays a major role because CEPA's programs are dependent\r\non community involvement.  Recycling containers must be located in an\r\naccessible location.  CEPA community also consider a household\r\nhazardous waste roundup in which a pickup is provided at a specified\r\ntime to ensure that residences do not have to initiate household\r\nhazardous waste disposal themselves.\r\n\r\nCEPA is committed to the reducing and recycling of solid waste and the\r\ncontrol of litter and household hazardous waste.  Constant monitoring\r\nand tracking of these programs will be conducted.\r\n\r\n                                SECTION 8\r\n                      ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION\r\n\r\nThe environmental laws and regulations in the Tribal Environmental\r\nPolicy Act, the Solid Waste Management Code, and the Quality\r\nAssurance/Quality Control (QA/QC)  Manual for the Campo Indian\r\nReservation will meet or exceed federal and state laws.  CEPA was\r\nestablished in 1988 as the enforcement agency for solid waste\r\nmanagement on the Reservation.  It is CEPA's responsibility to\r\nimplement, amend and enforce policies, ordinances and regulations\r\nrelating to the solid waste management program.  The QA/QC Manual was\r\ndeveloped to supplement the CEPA regulations on solid waste management\r\nand to provide standards and procedures for the monitoring of solid\r\nwaste facilities on the Reservation.\r\n\r\n8.1 PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of the CEPA solid waste enforcement program is to\r\nmeet the solid waste management needs of the people of the Reservation\r\nin a safe, sanitary and environmentally acceptable manner.  This will\r\nbe accomplished by:\r\n\r\n       o   providing timely, and sanitary solid waste collection\r\n           services;\r\n\r\n       o   assuring that all disposal sites, transfer stations and\r\n           solid waste processing facilities possess and abide by the\r\n           regulations of a solid waste facility permit issued by CEPA;\r\n\r\n       o   assuring that all necessary permitting procedures are\r\n           followed,\r\n\r\n       o   assuring that all permits are reviewed and, if necessary,\r\n           revised at least every year;\r\n\r\n       o   assuring that non-permitted, temporary solid waste storage\r\n           and handling facilities are operated in a sanitary manner,\r\n\r\n       o   assuring that all justified complaints relating to litter\r\n           and to disposal, collection, and storage of solid waste are\r\n           rectified according to current law; and\r\n\r\n       o   assuring that public information regarding solid waste\r\n           management is provided.\r\n\r\n8.2 SOLID WASTE FACILITY PERMITTING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nAll solid waste facility and transportation permits on the Campo\r\nReservation will be issued by CEPA.  A permit will be issued only if\r\nthe solid waste facility or transportation service is in full\r\ncompliance with the applicable rules and regulations and there has\r\nbeen opportunity for public review and comment at relevant stages of\r\nthe permitting process.  A permit can be denied if CEPA determines\r\nthat the applicant is unlikely to comply with permit conditions;  or\r\nthat the proposed method of transportation, the place or manner in\r\nwhich the solid waste is to be handled, recycled, treated, composted,\r\nor disposed of, or the method or location of temporary storage will be\r\ndetrimental to, or pollute the environment or natural resources of the\r\nreservation.  CEPA will review annually and, if necessary, revise any\r\npermit issued, modified or revised.  CEPA may establish guidelines\r\nthat allow exemptions from permit requirements that do not relate to\r\nmonitoring environmental quality.  These exemptions can be granted\r\nonly after notice and opportunity for a hearing.  An application for a\r\npermit must be filed at least 120 days prior to the beginning of a\r\nproposed activity.  Included in the permit application are such items\r\nas a list of equipment, vehicles and other items to be used by the\r\napplicant;  a site evaluation report including geographic, geologic,\r\nclimatic and hydrologic characteristics of all sites utilized by the\r\napplicant;  a description of environmental protection procedures;  a\r\ndescription of environmental and safety training programs for\r\nemployees;  and other relevant information.  Each permit application\r\nand report will be submitted under oath.  No permit will be issued\r\nwithout a public hearing at which the applicant and all interested\r\nparties have an opportunity to present evidence.  Other procedures\r\nspecifying permit issuance, denials, appeals, revisions and\r\nmodifications are described under Title V of the Campo Band of Mission\r\nIndians' Solid Waste Management Code of 1990.\r\n\r\n8.3 INSPECTION AND COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nCEPA is responsible for the investigation of the construction,\r\nmaintenance, and operation of any solid waste facility or\r\ntransportation service;  the inspection of any facility, equipment, or\r\nvehicle used for, and any records relating to, the handling,\r\nrecycling, treatment, composting or disposal of solid waste;  and the\r\nreview of technical or monitoring program reports or other reports\r\nfurnished by operators of solid waste facilities or transportation\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nIf CEPA receives a complaint concerning a solid waste facility,\r\ntransportation service, or temporary storage or handling facility, it\r\nshall inspect the facility or transporter to determine whether any\r\nlaw, regulation or permit has been or is being violated and if so,\r\ntake enforcement action.  If CEPA determines that it is not able or\r\nauthorized to take action concerning the complaint, CEPA shall refer\r\nthe complaint to the Tribal, federal or state agency that it\r\ndetermines is authorized to take action.  CEPA has the authority to\r\nissue cease and desist orders to permit violators and to expend monies\r\nto perform any cleanup, abatement, and/or remedial work it deems\r\nnecessary for the public health and safety.\r\n\r\n8.4 STAFF TRAINING AND STAFF NEEDS\r\n\r\nCEPA is governed by a board of three Commissioners who are members of\r\nthe Campo Band of Mission Indians.  These Commissioners are appointed\r\nby the Chairman of the Campo Band with the advice and consent of the\r\nGeneral Council.  Each Commissioner serves a four-year term, staggered\r\nagainst the terms of the other two Commissioners.  The Commissioners\r\nalso elect, from among themselves, one Commissioner to serve as the\r\nChairman of the Board.  The primary duties of the CEPA Commissioners\r\nare reviewed in Section 1.1, but also include conducting inspections\r\nof waste facilities and transporters; entering into contracts; and\r\nhiring staff.\r\n\r\nStaff training will be provided by CEPA for the instruction of general\r\nenforcement procedures and specific enforcement techniques.  Examples\r\nof staff training includes the training of the knowledge of codes,\r\nminimum standards and local ordinances;  the training of the knowledge\r\nof individual permit content and requirements;  and the training of\r\ntechniques used for inspection and monitoring.  Applicants for\r\noperating permits will also provide a training program to educate\r\nemployees on environmental concerns in managing solid waste and to\r\nprovide such employees with needed skills for the solid waste facility\r\nor transportation equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION 9\r\n                        FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n9.1 FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nThe solid waste management program is the responsibility of the\r\nGeneral Council of the Campo Band of Mission Indians and CEPA.  The\r\nGeneral Council is the legislative branch of the Tribal Government of\r\nthe Campo Indian Reservation and consists of all voting-age members of\r\nthe Campo Band of Mission Indians.  The General Council's approval is\r\nnecessary for the implementation of any action or resolution regarding\r\nthe Reservation or the inhabitants thereof, and is therefore\r\nultimately responsible for the solid waste management program\r\nimplementation and management.\r\n\r\nThe General Council approved the formation of CEPA in 1988 as the lead\r\nTribal Agency for the Solid Waste Management Program.  CEPA is\r\nresponsible for the implementation and enforcement of policies,\r\nordinances and regulations dealing with solid waste management, as\r\nwell as many other related duties.\r\n\r\n9.2 FUNDING SOURCES\r\n\r\nThe Campo Band of Mission Indians General Fund (General Fund)  will\r\nprovide most of the funds to finance the Reservation's solid waste\r\nprogram.  This General Fund consists of monies collected by the Tribe\r\nfrom such things as leases, royalties, taxes and rent.  It is likely\r\nthat federal or state grant money will be sought in the future to\r\nsupplement the General Fund to implement CEPA's solid waste program.\r\n\r\nThe major costs for CEPA's solid waste program include those for\r\ncollection and disposal of solid waste generated on the Reservation,\r\ntransportation and disposal of solid waste originating off the\r\nReservation, litter control, clean-up of existing dumps, and\r\nenforcement activities.  Because collection and disposal activities\r\nmust be performed on a regular basis, these activities constitute a\r\nlarge portion of the over-all expenditures. The other activities are\r\nperformed on an as-needed basis and are not as cost intensive.\r\n\r\nTo meet the goals of the Solid Waste Management Plan, the Campo Band\r\nof Mission Indians may negotiate and enter into long-term contacts for\r\nthe development of solid waste facilities, may enter into long-term\r\ncontracts for the operation of such facilities, and may secure\r\nlong-term markets for material and energy recovered from such\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n                            SECTION 10\r\n                            REFERENCES\r\n\r\nBond, W.  1971.

This kind of light has a high energy content and can destroy all kinds of molecules. The stronger the bond, the higher the energy content of the UV-light must be to destroy the bond. That is the reason why CFC's with rather strong bonds are persistent at earth level and only at higher level, where stronger UV-light occurs in the stratosphere, will release their chlorine atoms, which can destroy ozone at that level.\nOther chemical reactions, ultimately leading to complete destruction into basic materials like water, hydrochloric acid and carbon dioxyde also occur by the reaction of volatile molecules with oxygen or ozone in the air.\nIn general it can be said that the higher the degree of chlorination is, the more persistent to destruction it normally will be. E.g. HCFC's , containing some hydrogen, have a much lower ozone depletion potential, because they are broken down more rapidely - before the bulk reaches the ozone layer - than CFC's, which have only chlorine and fluorine atoms bounded to carbon.\nThe half life time is the timespan in which half the amount of material is destroyed.\nHalf life time in air (in sunlight)\nmaterial\n"}, {"score": 613.35583, "uuid": "9457981d-54c1-5767-aea5-4b6584ebf18c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1115wb-86-27266", "target_hostname": "illumin.usc.edu", "target_uri": "http://illumin.usc.edu/134/microbial-fuel-cells-generating-power-from-waste/", "page_rank": 1.2596995e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Illumin - Microbial Fuel Cells: Generating Power from <em>Waste</em>", "snippet": "<em>The</em> process is very similar to brewery wastewater treatment, with <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> being that <em>the</em> water must first be pretreated to remove toxins <em>and</em> other <em>non</em>-<em>biodegradable</em> materials.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tags: chemical engineering , energy & sustainability , recycling\nMicrobial Fuel Cells (MFCs) use bacteria to convert organic waste material into electrical energy. This environmentally-friendly process produces electricity without the combustion of fossil fuels. MFCs have various practical applications such as in breweries, domestic wastewater treatment, desalination plants, hydrogen production, remote sensing, and pollution remediation, and they can be used as a remote power source. Widespread use of MFCs in these areas can take our waste products and transform them into energy.\nIntroduction\nWashing one\u2019s hands with soap is usually accompanied with the satisfaction of killing harmful germs. However, scientists in many research labs around the world seek to put those pesky germs to work generating electricity. Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) are an emerging technology that uses bacteria to generate electricity from waste. Bacteria in a Microbial Fuel Cell break down our food and bodily wastes, effectively generating power from the materials that are usually thrown away. By tapping into this previously unharnessed source of power, clean, sustainable energy can be produced at low cost.\nMFCs are especially valuable in that there are many applications of their use help to reduce pollution and cut water treatment costs in a sustainable and environmentally-frie\u200bndly way. Currently, Microbial Fuel Cells are used to produce electricity while simultaneously cleaning wastewater. With future development, MFCs have the potential to produce hydrogen for fuel cells, desalinate sea water, and provide sustainable energy sources for remote areas. The Microbial Fuel Cell, which has historically been used only as a novelty in science fairs, is now a developing reality with great potential for improvements in cleaning techniques and power-generating processes.\nWhat is a microbial fuel cell?\nBruce Logan/Penn State University\nFigure 1: A simple microbial fuel cell.\nMicrobial fuel cells harness the power of bacteria and convert energy released in metabolic reactions into electrical energy. The actual cell consists of two electrodes separated by a semi-permeable membrane submersed in an electrolyte solution.\nFig. 1 depicts a typical MFC set-up in a research laboratory. The electrodes are connected by a wire and the anode (negative electrode) has bacteria growing on it. These bacteria break down food wastes and sewage to generate an electric current. Using microbes to generate electricity implies that the processes in an MFC are self-sustaining; the bacteria replicate and continue to produce power indefinitely as long as there is a food source to nourish the bacteria. Moreover, MFCs are very efficient, do not rely on fossil fuels for energy, and can run effectively on sources like food waste and sewage.\nHow Does a Microbial Fuel Cell Work?\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the Microbial Fuel Cell is divided into two halves: aerobic and anaerobic. The aerobic half has a positively charged electrode and is bubbled with oxygen, much like a fish tank. The anaerobic half does not have oxygen, allowing a negatively charged electrode to act as the electron receptor for the bacterial processes. The chambers are separated by a semi-permeable membrane to keep oxygen out of the anaerobic chamber while still allowing hydrogen ions (H+) pass through.\nMercer\nFigure 2: A schematic of a microbial fuel cell.\n1. The bacteria on the anode decompose organic matter and free H+ ions and electrons.\n2. The electrons flow from the bacteria to the anode, sometimes assisted by a mediator molecule.\n3. The electrons flow up from the anode, through a wire, and onto the cathode. While flowing through the wire, an electrical current is generated that can be used to perform work.\n4. The H+ ions flow through the semi-permeable membrane to the cathode. This process is driven by the electro-chemical gradient resulting from the high concentration of H+ ions near the anode.\n5. The electrons from the cathode combine with dissolved oxygen and the H+ ions to form pure H 2O.\nIn the anaerobic chamber, a solution containing food for the bacteria is circulated. This food consists of glucose or acetate, compounds commonly found in food waste and sewage. The bacteria metabolize food by first breaking apart the food molecules into hydrogen ions, carbon dioxide, and electrons. As shown in Fig. 3, bacteria use the electrons to produce energy by way of the electron transport chain. The microbial fuel cell disrupts the electron transport chain using a mediator molecule to shuttle electrons to the anode. In many ways, a microbial fuel cell is an extension of the electron transport chain where the final step of the process (the combination of oxygen, electrons, and H+ to form water) is transferred outside of the bacterial cell from which energy can be harvested.\nMercer/Campbell and Reece/Pearson Education, Inc.\nFigure 3: The electron transport chain.\n1. The electron transport chain begins with NADH, a biological transport molecule, releasing a high energy electron (e-) and a proton (H+).\n2. The electron follows the red path through the proteins (large blobs) in the mitochondrial membrane.\n3. As the electron passes through each protein, it pumps hydrogen ions (H+) through the membrane.\n4. In a normal bacterial cell, the electron continues along the dotted red path where it combines with oxygen to make water.\n5. In a microbial fuel cell, the electron continues along the solid red path, where it is picked up by a mediator molecule and taken to the anode.\nA Brief History of the Microbial Fuel Cell\nThe idea of obtaining energy from bacteria began in 1911 with M. C. Potter, a professor of botany at the University of Durham [1]. In his studies of how microorganisms degrade organic compounds, he discovered that electrical energy was also produced. Potter had the idea of trying to harvest this newfound source of energy for human use. He was able to construct a primitive microbial fuel cell, but not enough was known about the metabolism of bacteria for the design to be improved upon.\nIn fact, little development occurred on his primitive designs until the 1980s. M. J. Allen and H. Peter Bennetto from Kings College in London revolutionized the original microbial fuel cell design. Spurred by their desire to provide cheap and reliable power to third world countries, Allen and Bennetto combined advancements in the understanding of the electron transport chain and significant advancements in technology to produce the basic design that is still used in MFCs today. However, use of MFCs in third world countries is still in the pilot stages because of the complexities of simplifying the design enough to allow poor rural farmers to build them. The advancements by the Kings College team have shown the scientific community that the microbial fuel cell can be useful technology and generate increased interest in its development.\nAs scientists all over the world began researching the microbial fuel cell, one major question still remained: how do the electrons get from the electron transport chain to the anode? While researching this problem in the 1990s, B-H. Kim, a researcher from the Korean Institute of Science and Technology, discovered that certain species of bacteria were electrochemically active and didn\u2019t require the use of a mediator molecule to transport electrons to the electrodes. Thus, a new type of microbial fuel cell was born that eliminated the use of the expensive and sometimes toxic mediators.\nCurrently, researchers are working to optimize electrode materials, types and combinations of bacteria, and electron transfer in microbial fuel cells. Even though the idea of harnessing the energy produced by bacteria has been around for almost 100 years, researchers have just begun to fully understand the MFC and how to bring out its true potential.\nWays the MFC can improve the world\nThe microbial fuel cell has current and potential uses in brewery and domestic wastewater treatment, desalination, hydrogen production, remote sensing, pollution remediation, and as a remote power source. Many new applications are beginning to be tested and may come into widespread use in the near future.\nBrewery Wastewater Treatment\nBrewery and food manufacturing wastewater can be treated by microbial fuel cells because their wastewater is rich in organic compounds that can serve as food for the microorganisms. Breweries are ideal for the implementation of microbial fuel cells, as their wastewater composition is always the same; these constant conditions allow bacteria to adapt and become more efficient. Currently, Fosters, an Australian beer company, has begun testing out an MFC to clean its wastewater while generating electricity and clean water [2]. Fosters has installed the first small-scale microbial fuel cell for brewery wastewater treatment, pictured in Fig. 4. Each long tube is one large Microbial Fuel Cell. Twelve MFCs are placed in parallel to clean the large volume of wastewater. Wastewater flows in at the top, is cleaned by bacteria, and comes out the bottom as purified water. Partnered with the University of Queensland, Fosters\u2019 plans to improve the MFC\u2019s cleaning power and electrical output and eventually build a 660 gallon, 2 Kilowatt MFC that cleans all of the company\u2019s wastewater. The power generated from cleaning the brewery wastewater is expected to pay for the initial cost of the Microbial Fuel Cell in ten years.\nSewage Treatment\nCoates/Reprinted with permission from the American Society for Microbiology (Microbe, January 2006, p. 20-24).\nFigure 4: A microbial fuel cell in a brewery used for wastewater treatment.\nSewage wastewater can also be converted via microbial fuel cells to decompose the waste organic material contained within it. Research has shown that MFCs can reduce the amount of organic material present in sewage wastewater up to 80% [3]. The process is very similar to brewery wastewater treatment, with the difference being that the water must first be pretreated to remove toxins and other non-biodegradable materials. This is a challenging step because sewage wastewater often varies in composition and may require extensive treatment before it can be cleaned by the MFC. However, this extensive treatment is justified by the electricity produced while cleaning the wastewater. The electricity production from MFCs will help to offset the high costs of processing wastewater [4]. Wastewater treatment plants could end up dumping fewer pollutants into oceans and rivers if the money saved from the electricity bill is put to work further cleansing the wastewater.\nDesalination\nDesalination of sea water and brackish water for use as drinking water has always presented significant problems because of the amount of energy required to remove the dissolved salts from the water. By using an adapted microbial fuel cell, this process could proceed with no external electrical energy input [5]. By adding a third chamber in between the two electrodes of a standard MFC and filling it with sea water, the cell\u2019s positive and negative electrodes attract the positive and negative salt ions in the water and, using semi-permeable membranes, filters out the salt from the sea water, as seen in Fig. 5. Salt removal efficiencies of up to 90% have been recorded in laboratory work, but much higher removal efficiencies are required to produce drinking-quality water [5].\nPhoto courtesy of JHU Global Water Program/ http://globalwater.j\u200bhu.edu/\nFigure 5: A desalination microbial fuel cell.\nHydrogen Production\nMicrobial fuel cells can be used to generate hydrogen for use as an alternative fuel. When used for hydrogen production, the MFC needs to be supplemented by an external power source to get over the energy barrier of turning all of the organic material into carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas [2]. The standard MFC is converted to hydrogen production by keeping both chambers anaerobic and supplementing the MFC with 0.25 volts of electricity [6]. Hydrogen bubbles form at the cathode and are collected for use as fuel source [7]. Although electricity is used instead of generated as in normal MFCs, this method of producing hydrogen is very efficient because more than 90% of the protons and electrons generated by the bacteria at the anode are turned into hydrogen gas [8]. Conventional production of hydrogen requires 10 times the amount of energy as an adapted MFC, making the MFC the most efficient and environmentally-frie\u200bndly way to generate hydrogen for use as a fuel.\nMercer (adapted from Microbe Magazine)/Reprinted with permission from the American Society for Microbiology (Microbe, January 2006, p. 20-24).\nFigure 6: Microbial fuel cell integrated into riverbed.\nRemote Sensors\nMFCs can run low-power sensors that collect data from remote areas. For example, scientists have replaced a traditional wireless thermometer in the Palouse River in Washington with one powered by a MFC. This microbial fuel cell is integrated into the riverbed, as shown in Fig. 6. A simple microbial fuel cell consisting of a cathode attached to an anode by a metal wire. By placing the anode in the anaerobic sediment of a river or ocean and placing the cathode in the aerobic water right above the sediment, a current is generated. Anaerobic bacteria that naturally grow in the sediment produce the small current that can be used to charge a capacitor to store energy for whenever the sensor needs it. One major advantage of using a microbial fuel cell in remote sensing rather than a traditional battery is that the bacteria reproduce, giving the MFC a significantly longer lifetime than traditional batteries [2]. The sensor can thus be left alone in a remote area for many years without maintenance.\nGilberto Esparza\nFigure 7: A robot powered by an integrated microbial fuel cell.\nCleansing Polluted Lakes and Rivers\nMicrobial fuel cells can also be used in the bioremediation of water containing organic pollutants such as toluene and benzene, compounds found in gasoline. The MFC design is altered so that the fuel cell floats on top of polluted water. The anode is submerged in the water where organic pollutants feed the bacteria while the cathode floats on top of the water. The organic pollutants are decomposed to carbon dioxide and water, cleansing the polluted lake or stream. The MFC can be left alone in remote natural bodies of water, just like the remote sensor [9]. A working prototype shown in Fig. 7 has been deployed in a polluted marsh in Mexico and is beginning the process of cleaning up the worlds remote rivers.\nRemote Power Source\nThe advancement of microbial fuel cell technologies in the 1980s was largely spurred by the dream of providing cheap, accessible power to remote regions of Africa, where 74% of the population lives without electricity [10]. Although implementation of homemade MFC use in Africa is just beginning, microbial fuel cells that run on manure and dirt have been developed and tested. The electrical current produced by a simple homemade MFC is enough to recharge a cell phone battery, an important communication and lighting tool to rural African communities. Companies such as Lebone Solutions are trying to create simple microbial fuel cells that can be easily built by using commonly found items in rural farming communities. The materials required to construct this simple MFC are soil, manure, copper wire, buckets, and graphite cloth. Fig. 8 shows the simple homemade MFC that could charge cell phones in poor African countries.\nLebone/inhabitat.com\u200b\nFigure 8: A cheap microbial fuel cell made by the Lebone group.\nMicrobial fuel cells have become an interesting and promising area of research. The many applications of MFCs will help to reduce the use of fossil fuels and allow for energy gain from wastes. MFC technology does not have the power to change the world single-handedly; microbial fuel cells will never be able to produce enough electricity to take the place of a coal-fired power plant. They will, however, help to bring the world to becoming a sustainable and more environmentally-frie\u200bndly place.\nReferences\n[1] \"MURI Public Outreach: How Does an MFC Work?\" MURI: Microbial Fuel Cell Project.

Conventional production of hydrogen requires 10 times the amount of energy as an adapted MFC, making the MFC the most efficient and environmentally-frie\u200bndly way to generate hydrogen for use as a fuel.\nMercer (adapted from Microbe Magazine)/Reprinted with permission from the American Society for Microbiology (Microbe, January 2006, p. 20-24).\nFigure 6: Microbial fuel cell integrated into riverbed.\nRemote Sensors\nMFCs can run low-power sensors that collect data from remote areas. For example, scientists have replaced a traditional wireless thermometer in the Palouse River in Washington with one powered by a MFC. This microbial fuel cell is integrated into the riverbed, as shown in Fig. 6. A simple microbial fuel cell consisting of a cathode attached to an anode by a metal wire. By placing the anode in the anaerobic sediment of a river or ocean and placing the cathode in the aerobic water right above the sediment, a current is generated. Anaerobic bacteria that naturally grow in the sediment produce the small current that can be used to charge a capacitor to store energy for whenever the sensor needs it. One major advantage of using a microbial fuel cell in remote sensing rather than a traditional battery is that the bacteria reproduce, giving the MFC a significantly longer lifetime than traditional batteries [2]. The sensor can thus be left alone in a remote area for many years without maintenance.\nGilberto Esparza\nFigure 7: A robot powered by an integrated microbial fuel cell.\nCleansing Polluted Lakes and Rivers\nMicrobial fuel cells can also be used in the bioremediation of water containing organic pollutants such as toluene and benzene, compounds found in gasoline. The MFC design is altered so that the fuel cell floats on top of polluted water. The anode is submerged in the water where organic pollutants feed the bacteria while the cathode floats on top of the water. The organic pollutants are decomposed to carbon dioxide and water, cleansing the polluted lake or stream. The MFC can be left alone in remote natural bodies of water, just like the remote sensor [9]. A working prototype shown in Fig. 7 has been deployed in a polluted marsh in Mexico and is beginning the process of cleaning up the worlds remote rivers.\nRemote Power Source\nThe advancement of microbial fuel cell technologies in the 1980s was largely spurred by the dream of providing cheap, accessible power to remote regions of Africa, where 74% of the population lives without electricity [10]. Although implementation of homemade MFC use in Africa is just beginning, microbial fuel cells that run on manure and dirt have been developed and tested. The electrical current produced by a simple homemade MFC is enough to recharge a cell phone battery, an important communication and lighting tool to rural African communities. Companies such as Lebone Solutions are trying to create simple microbial fuel cells that can be easily built by using commonly found items in rural farming communities. The materials required to construct this simple MFC are soil, manure, copper wire, buckets, and graphite cloth. Fig. 8 shows the simple homemade MFC that could charge cell phones in poor African countries.\nLebone/inhabitat.com\u200b\nFigure 8: A cheap microbial fuel cell made by the Lebone group.\nMicrobial fuel cells have become an interesting and promising area of research. The many applications of MFCs will help to reduce the use of fossil fuels and allow for energy gain from wastes. MFC technology does not have the power to change the world single-handedly; microbial fuel cells will never be able to produce enough electricity to take the place of a coal-fired power plant. They will, however, help to bring the world to becoming a sustainable and more environmentally-frie\u200bndly place.\nReferences\n[1] \"MURI Public Outreach: How Does an MFC Work?\" MURI: Microbial Fuel Cell Project.

But is recycling always the best solution? Not if there\u2019s no demand for the recycled materials. Not if more energy is consumed and more greenhouse gases are emitted in the recycling process than would be used to manufacture a new product. Not if we don\u2019t actually recycle but instead just sort the waste into piles of different materials and then ship those piles overseas with no control over what happens to them after that.\nSecondly, as the public begins to feel the impact of global energy price rises, the UK needs to quickly find sustainable and secure sources of energy, using reliable, well-proven technologies. And to have any chance of minimising the impacts of global climate change, countries such as the UK must finds ways to meet their material and energy needs whilst rapidly and significantly cutting their greenhouse gas emissions.\nIs there a realistic solution to both these issues?\nYes. This is a route that the UK could adopt which would change our perceptions of waste and its disposal, contribute to our battle against climate change and help meet our needs for affordability and security of energy supplies.\nIn recent years the Institution of Mechanical Engineers has been advocating that waste should not be regarded as a problem to be \u2018dealt with\u2019 but as a valuable resource which could help us meet our national and regional environmental targets and commitments.\nThis is by developing a network of Energy from Waste plants (EfW).\nIn the UK, we traditionally adopted two simple ways of dealing with waste: bury it (known as landfilling), or burn it and bury what was left (known as incineration).\nHowever, as the world becomes more environmentally aware, there is a growing recognition that harmful emissions from both these methods are unacceptable and that alternatives need to be found.\nOf course, different waste streams should be regarded as resources in different ways, e.g. metals should be collected, sorted into different types and re-melted. However, for many other types of waste, recovering its value to provide electricity, heat and/or transport fuels is an easy, valuable and more environmentally sound solution than recycling or landfilling. Modern EfW plants meet very strict environmental standards and perceptions of them as \u2018dirty\u2019 need to be robustly and forcefully challenged.\nIt is important to note that an EfW plant should not be seen as a waste treatment plant but more accurately as a power station or even a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) station. A thermal EfW plant, in particular, \u2018treats\u2019 waste in the same way that a coal-fired power station \u2018treats\u2019 coal. Any other benefit, such as volumetric reduction, is a useful by-product but is not the primary purpose of an EfW plant.\nUnfortunately, most legislation over recent years has erroneously and dogmatically focused on EfW as waste treatment rather than as energy production, and has attempted to deal with an EfW plant as if it were an incinerator, rather than a power station. The approach is very different in most other parts of Europe, where recycling and EfW are both used to their optimum potential, and, as a result, landfilling is successfully minimised.\nEfW, in its various formats, is the only \u2018renewable\u2019 (most suitable \u2018waste\u2019 is bio-waste) technology which can realistically meet the EU and UK 2020 commitments for \u2018heat\u2019 and \u2018transport\u2019 sector requirements, whilst at the same time also providing significant quantities of electric power.\nFor larger waste streams, combustion technology inherently produces both heat and power, in the ratio of two to three times as much heat energy as electrical, although in the UK we have traditionally wasted the heat by exhausting it to atmosphere, even more ridiculous when we have over one million people classed as being in fuel poverty!\nIt is extremely improbable that the UK\u2019s legally binding renewable energy commitments can be reached unless EfW plants cease to be regarded as a less-desirable form of waste treatment process and become regarded as the best-proven, safe, clean energy recovery solution available to us.\nThe Institution of Mechanical Engineers therefore recommends the following:\n1. The Government should review its energy strategy and make EfW a key component in energy production, with the added benefit of avoiding waste to landfill.\n2. The Government should promote and encourage investment in district and community heating projects with local \u2018waste\u2019 being used as the fuel resource. Appropriate targeting of such schemes could help to eliminate energy poverty in the UK within a generation.\n3. The Government should redefine waste as an energy resource, allowing the new Department for Energy and Climate Change to focus on its optimal use.\n4. The Government should abandon its focus on recycling as the only way to rid us of landfills, as this is quite unachievable and is clearly deceiving the public about what is really happening to their waste.\n5. Recycling should only be for waste products which cannot be more sustainably converted into electricity, heat and/or transport fuels.\nAn Energy from Waste (EfW) plant works by taking the waste and converting its potential energy into any type of usable energy \u2013 the three main forms being heating, electricity and transport fuels \u2013 just as coal, oil and gas are used as fuels in fossil-fired power stations.\nEfW can be used with many different types of waste from domestic, commercial, industrial, construction and demolition, to sewage and agricultural etc. The only criterion is that the waste fraction is combustible and/or biodegradable.\nIt is important to note that an EfW plant is not the same as an \u2018incinerator\u2019 and it is highly misleading to describe it as such. An incinerator is purpose-built to reduce the volume of waste by burning (incinerating) it to produce an ash which is disposed of elsewhere, e.g. to landfill. An EfW plant, by contrast, is purpose built to provide usable energy and can be designed to have little or no output to landfill.\nMost EfW plants should correctly be described as combustion systems which are \u2018the process of burning\u2019 or \u2018any process in which a substance reacts to produce a significant rise in temperature and the emission of light\u2019 or \u2018a process in which a compound reacts slowly with oxygen\u2019 with the creation of energy and heat which can be used.\nMost people in the UK, and seemingly the Government, do not know the difference between \u2018incineration\u2019 and \u2018combustion\u2019. The term \u2018incineration\u2019 stems from the outdated method of burning Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in order to destroy it. This thinking, in turn, derives from seeing waste as a \u2018problem\u2019 rather than as a \u2018resource\u2019; there is a particular issue here, in that the UK Government is itself very unclear on this subject! Defra, for example, constantly refers to EfW plants as \u2018incinerators\u2019 and despite public consultation on this issue appears to have ignored the feedback!\nIronically, the European Directive governing EfW plants is known as the Waste Incineration Directive (WID) whereas, for large utility power stations, the relevant directive is known as the Large Combustion Plant Directive. Since the latter is describing a virtually identical process to EfW, it is not at all clear why the Government has decided that one is \u2018combustion\u2019 and the other is \u2018incineration\u2019. If we were to describe Drax (a coal-fired power station in Yorkshire), for instance, as a plant whose primary purpose is to reduce the volume of coal, render it inert and from which power is \u2018recovered\u2019, we would rightly be treated with derision; logically, this should be the same response when people describe EfW plants in the same way.\nThere are four main processes which are used in EfW plants, three are thermal (combustion, gasification and pyrolysis) and one is biological (anaerobic digestion). For reasons which are not at all obvious, as all four processes have been in widespread use for many decades, the Government has decided that \u2018gasification\u2019, \u2018pyrolysis\u2019 and \u2018digestion\u2019 are Advanced Conversion Technologies (ACTs), while \u2018combustion\u2019 is not.\nCombustion\nThis is the most common and well-proven thermal process using a wide variety of fuels. The combustion process is that used in all the large coal-fired power stations in the UK, for example, and follows a process known as the Rankine Cycle.\nThe Rankine Cycle is a simple thermodynamic cycle in which a steam turbine or engine operates.\nIn the conventional steam Rankine Cycle, there are four major components, the steam turbine (or engine), the condenser, the boiler feedwater pump and the boiler itself. figure 1 shows these four components within a system boundary to demonstrate the main inputs and outputs.\nHeat from burning the fuel (Qin) is applied to the system via the boiler and is dissipated (Qout) from the system via the condenser cooling medium.\nSimilarly work (Win) is applied to the system to drive the boiler feedwater pump (usually in the form of electricity) and work (Wout) is exported from the system via the turbine drive shaft.\nThe Rankine Cycle inherently produces both electric (or mechanical) power and heat. The heat energy produced is not a by-product, as with some other processes, but is the basic principle on which the system works. It is therefore, inherently, a CHP plant. The primary issue in the UK is that we have become accustomed to using only the electrical output of the plant (the Wout in the diagram) and have wasted the enormous amount of heat energy (Qout), which can be two to four times as large as the electrical output of the plant.\nGasification\nThis is defined as a thermal reaction with insufficient oxygen present for reaction of all hydrocarbons (compounds of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen molecules) to carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). Gasification is where oxygen in the form of air, steam or pure oxygen is reacted at high temperature with the available carbon in the waste to produce a gas (e.g. methane, CH4), ash or slag and a tar product. Although the gasification method is very recent in its application to biomass and waste materials, the underlying technology, the gasification of coal, is now extremely well proven. The major benefit of gasification of bio-wastes is that the product gas can be used directly, after significant cleaning, to fuel a gas turbine generator which itself will form part of a CHP or Combined-Cycle Gas Turbine system, thus theoretically improving the overall thermal efficiency of the plant. The main disadvantage is that there are many more items of large equipment and the capital investment is correspondingly higher, so the pay-back period will have to be carefully defined.\nPyrolysis\nThis is also a thermal process and involves the thermal degradation of organic waste in the absence of free oxygen to produce a carbonaceous char, oils and combustible gases.\nAlthough pyrolysis is an age-old technology, its application to biomass and waste materials is a relatively recent development. An alternative term for pyrolysis is thermolysis, which is technically more accurate for biomass energy processes because these systems are usually starved-air rather than the total absence of oxygen. Although all the products of pyrolysis may be useful, the main fuel for power generation is the pyrolysis oil.\nDepending on the process, this oil may be used as liquid fuel for burning in a boiler or as a substitute for diesel fuel in reciprocating engines, although this normally requires further processing.\nEfW processes.\nAnaerobic digestion (AD).\nThis is a biological process which is a method most commonly used with liquid and semi-liquid slurries such as animal waste. It is also used for obtaining gas from human sewage, but is now being applied to a limited degree to certain other wastes and biomass streams. AD utilises the same biological processes that occur in a landfill site, but under controlled conditions in a digester system. The four-stage process of hydrolysis, acidification, acetogenesis and methanogenesis takes place in the digester tank, which is a warmed, sealed, airless container where bacteria ferment organic material in oxygen-free conditions to produce biogas. The amount of biogas produced is limited by the size of the digester tank, so is largely used as a fuel which may be burned in a conventional gas boiler to heat nearby buildings or in a reciprocating engine which is used to generate electricity.\nThe main advantage of AD is that it deals well with \u2018wet\u2019 waste, which is a real problem for all other forms. It is also ideal for small-scale operations, such as farms, where enough energy (electricity and heat) can be produced to run the farm (including fuelling some of the vehicles) from what is produced on the farm. Its drawbacks are that it takes up a relatively large amount of space and it is often difficult to avoid odours, both of which make it less suitable for urban installations.\nFurthermore, it is relatively inefficient (i.e. amount of useful energy recovered) when compared on a like-for-like basis with other forms of EfW, because not all of the organic matter is converted; figures as low as 20-25% of the efficiency of a combustion EfW plant have been heard. Furthermore, most AD systems tend to be \u2018batch\u2019 rather than \u2018continuous\u2019 processes, which means that parallel systems are required if a continuous output is needed.\nCombustion is, by far, the most commonly used technology, both in the UK and other European countries, although the incidence of plants in many other countries is very much greater than it is in the UK, where the public distrust of these plants (e.g. by erroneously calling them \u2018incinerators\u2019) has been encouraged by several NGOs and other pressure groups over the years.\nThe second is AD, mainly because it is seen by Government, NGOs and the like as a \u2018safer\u2019 and more \u2018environmentally friendly\u2019 option. There is little substance to these claims.\nNeither pyrolysis nor gasification has yet achieved any great market penetration, mainly due to enormous teething problems with both of these processes where they have been tried, mainly in other countries.\nBy 2005 there were 19 EfW plants operating in the UK fuelled by MSW or Refuse-Derived Fuel; four more were under construction, three more had planning consent and a further four had applied for planning consent. The situation has changed substantially over the intervening years and some of the plants planned at that time are now in operation.\nHowever, because of the lack of real operating experience with other processes, almost all the current EfW plants in the UK are of the combustion type. This is largely because gasification and pyrolysis processes are still not adequately proven for use with waste and AD, while growing in popularity, is better suited to smaller rural installations such as farms.\nThe current situation\nThe following shows the approximate percentages of waste arising in the UK.\nHousehold waste [11%], i.e., the waste we produce in our homes; this will be a varying mixture of, for example, food waste that is biodegradable, plastics which are not biodegradable but combustible, metals which are neither biodegradable nor combustible but are recyclable, glass which is neither biodegradable nor combustible and is difficult to recycle, paper which is biodegradable, combustible and recyclable, etc. This simple description exposes the folly of assuming that all domestic waste is, or can be, \u2018recyclable\u2019 in the narrow definition that this word has been given in the UK.\nCommercial waste [13%], which is predominantly office waste emanating from the service sector, is similar in consistency to domestic waste and is increasingly being regarded with domestic waste as MSW.\nIndustrial waste [10%] contains all the elements of commercial waste but with the additional by-products of liquid effluents, oils, which are increasingly being regarded as \u2018hazardous\u2019 and which have to be dealt with separately.\nConstruction and demolition (C&D) waste [36%]; this generally differs considerably from the foregoing waste streams in that it contains a high proportion of minerals which are not biodegradable or combustible and which are often not worth recycling. There is, however, normally a percentage of wood waste which is, of course, readily combustible or biodegradable over time.\nThe major problem with the wood element of C&D waste is that it is almost invariably treated in some way, chemically or painted or otherwise contaminated, which may be classified as hazardous under present legislation and may have to be dealt with in specially designated facilities.\nAccurate statistics for total waste are notoriously hard to come by in the UK. This is largely because of what is defined as waste and the legislative pre-occupation with Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), to the virtual exclusion of all other types. In 2005, it was estimated that the UK produced 307 million tonnes of waste (per year)1 or \u2018enough to fill the Albert Hall every two hours\u2019. This is quite simply not sustainable.\nOf that, Defra also estimated that 46.4 million tonnes of \u2018household and similar waste\u2019 were produced in the UK with 60% of this landfilled, 34% \u2018recycled\u2019 and 6% \u2018incinerated\u2019. According to the official statistics, none of this resource was used as fuel in EfW plants. However in reality, the 6% classified as \u2018incinerated\u2019 was actually combusted in EfW plants.\nWhere our waste comes from:\nAgricultural Waste [<1%] varies hugely depending on the type of farming in a particular area: arable farming produces a greatly different waste stream from livestock farming, for example.\nAgricultural waste is a catch-all phrase for waste streams as different as cattle dung, poultry litter, used fencing, asbestos, plastic wrapping, all of which have to be dealt with in very different ways.\nA further problem is that much agricultural waste does not enter the statistics, as farmers deal with it themselves as they have always done.\nSewage Waste [<1%], although usually dealt with by completely separate legislation, included under the general heading of \u2018waste\u2019; \u2018sewage\u2019 refers solely to the biological waste produced by human beings. However, unlike the dung of most animals, because of our modern diets, human sewage contains trace elements which are deemed to be undesirable (even after suitable treatment) for spreading on arable land.\nMining & Quarrying (M&Q) waste [28%] is probably the most forgotten single waste stream in the UK but is the second largest. The main problem with M&Q waste is that it is nearly all mineral waste, which is neither biodegradable nor combustible and is difficult to recycle. It lends itself ideally to \u2018re-use\u2019, the second priority in the hierarchy, but this usually requires energy-intensive processes which render it commercially unattractive and may well have an unacceptable carbon footprint, since the waste is largely inert material.\nThe trouble is waste needs to be dealt with. In the past the UK has adopted a landfill policy \u2013 bury all waste. However, today the UK is reluctantly phasing out landfill sites, partly because it is running out of suitable locations for new landfills and partly because of the European Landfill Directive (1999) which was passed into law in England and Wales in 2002 and Scotland in 2003 and will require the organic fraction of landfilled waste to be reduced by:\n\u2022 25% by 2010,\n\u2022 50% by 2013 and\n\u2022 65% by 2020 (all below 1995 levels)\nAlthough the above relates only to the organic fraction of waste streams, there is a growing societal movement to eventually dispense with landfill completely as a means of waste disposal. However, unlike most other European governments, both the UK and Scottish Governments have decided that the main alternative to landfill will be \u2018recycling\u2019 and that \u2018recovery\u2019 (by which they mean EfW) is only slightly preferable to landfill. We have already exposed the fallacy of this argument and believe that the only positive way to avoid landfilling in the future is through a pragmatic combination of recycling and EfW.\nCovering up the problem of waste\nThe type of waste taken by an EfW plant is dependent on which of the four main technologies has been chosen. In fact, the type of waste stream may itself determine which technology is chosen. For example, \u2018wet\u2019 biowaste can really be dealt with only in an AD system which is most effective in dealing with slurries rather than solids.\nExamples of wastes which are best dealt with by AD are animal waste, e.g., cattle dung, food waste, e.g., from kitchen and catering, although increasingly green waste and vegetable matter are proving to be good feedstock for AD systems.\nThermal processes, on the other hand, are more efficient when the \u2018dryness fraction\u2019 is high, i.e., moisture content is low. The thermal processes are ideally suited to solid wastes, although certain liquids and gases can also be used if they are suitable for combustion. Wood waste from construction and demolition sources, for example, is usually very dry and makes an ideal feedstock for thermal processes. Green wood, such as is derived from thinning and trimmings in forestry, will have to be dried for a certain period, before entering the thermal process.\nNon-combustibles, such as metals, glass and other inert materials, are unsuitable for EfW plants and are normally recycled by other means. Most plastics cannot be dealt with by biological process, but usually have a very high energy content which makes them very suitable for the combustion process. It should be noted, however, that the vast majority of plastics will have been manufactured from fossil fuels and this portion of any waste stream cannot therefore be classed as \u2018renewable\u2019.\nThe other main output of a conventional, combustion EfW plant is ash. This is normally of two different types: a relatively small quantity of \u2018fly ash\u2019 which is legally considered to be hazardous and therefore is disposed of in a hazardous landfill site. The much larger quantity of bottom ash is inert and can be used as roadfill or aggregate for concrete manufacture \u2013 although some still goes to landfill.\nIt is in this area that the greatest myths have arisen about EfW plants. It is also where the malicious confusion of EfW plants with incinerators has been most misleading to both the public and Government.\nThe emissions from the EfW plant itself will vary depending on a) the technology used and b) the \u2018waste\u2019 feedstock. Since most of the public concern is related to combustion EfW using MSW as a fuel, we shall concentrate on this area.\nMost of the world\u2019s thermal power stations use the combustion process, and this process has been refined over many years to ensure as complete combustion of the fuel as possible. As a general rule, the more complete the combustion, the cleaner will be the resulting emissions. The resultant emissions from the Rankine Cycle process will range from most dirty in the case of coal as fuel, to least dirty in the case of natural gas as fuel, with MSW as fuel lying somewhere between the two.\nLogically, the dirtier the emissions from the power station are, the more they must be cleaned up in an emissions control plant before they are finally released into the atmosphere. So even a dirty combustion process need not necessarily lead to harmful emissions to atmosphere.\nThe emissions control plant (which is not an integral part of the Rankine Cycle process) is nowadays designed in a series of clean-up stages which may include cyclonic separators, bag filters and/or active carbon filters. Progressively tightening legislation over several decades has led to any power plant nowadays being considerably cleaner in its emissions than has ever previously been the case.\nModern emissions control systems are capable of reducing particulate matter in the power station emissions to incredibly low proportions; indeed, many modern power stations actually clean the ambient air as it passes through the power station!\nBecause of public concerns about the emissions from EfW plants, a European Directive on the Incineration of Waste was developed in 2000, which is now almost always referred to as the Waste Incineration Directive (WID), passed into law in England and Wales in 2002 and in Scotland the same year.\nApplying WID to a combustion EfW plant is relatively straightforward in technical terms, but has required substantial redesign of the combustion process technology and is therefore very costly. The net result, however, is that the emission concentrations from a combustion EfW plant are required to be ten times lower than from an equivalent large, coal-fired combustion plant.\nFormer incinerators acquired something of a reputation for producing certain toxins, mainly dioxins and furans. Nevertheless, bad though they were in this respect, incinerators were never the sole, or even major, cause of the emission of such toxins. Other sources, such as barbecues, fireworks, etc still produce as many dioxins but there are more emissions emanating, for example, from our coal-fired power stations.\nSpecifically regarding dioxins, Enviros and the University of Birmingham concluded: \u201cDioxins and furans are emitted approximately equally from landfill and incineration.\u201d Defra concluded: \u201cDioxin emissions from modern energy from waste plants \u2013 all of which must now meet the very stringent requirements of the EU Waste Incineration Directive \u2013 are very small compared with other common environmental sources such as building and forest fires, and even fireworks. The emission limits under this directive are lower than those for non-waste energy generation sources.\u201d The dioxin emission limit value required by WID from an EfW plant is a concentration in the chimney of 0.1 ng/m\u00b3 (one billionth of a gram per cubic metre at ambient temperature and pressure).\nThis is an equivalent concentration to one third of a sugar lump dissolved evenly in Loch Ness.\nHowever, unlike dissolving sugar in Loch Ness where the concentration would increase as more sugar is added, emissions from the EfW plant are diluted an infinite amount as they mix with the surrounding air. double standards\u2014 the proximity principle EfW plants can be designed for a very wide range of sizes and can be suited to either local or regional energy production. However, documents such as the Defra Waste Strategy 2000 insisted on the \u2018proximity principle\u2019 regarding the transport of waste, so the official trend is towards local plants rather than regional or centralised plants.\nThe \u2018proximity principle\u2019 does indeed make sense if the heat energy from the EfW can be utilised in a district or community heating scheme, \u2018heat\u2019 being more difficult to transport over long distances.\nHowever, if the UK continues its present policy of using only the electrical output of an EfW plant and simply wasting the heat energy, then there are economies of scale to be gained from larger, more centralised, plants.\nFurthermore, the \u2018proximity principle\u2019 is rather a double standard in the way it is applied in the UK. It is very rigorously applied to EfW plants and \u2018truck movements\u2019 are frequently cited to refuse planning permission for larger EfW plants. On the other hand, the \u2018proximity principle\u2019 is not applied at all to recycling plants.\nOnce \u2018recyclables\u2019 are delivered to the Material Recycling Facility \u2013 which is normally a separating and sorting centre, not a recycling plant \u2013 they are officially declared as \u2018recycled\u2019 (i.e. they are counted towards the local or national recycling targets because those statistics, as explained earlier, treat \u2018sent for recycling\u2019 to be the same as \u2018recycled\u2019). Because actual recycling plants in the UK are still few and far between, many recyclables are actually transported for considerable distances within the UK. However, there is a much more serious issue in that huge quantities of some major recyclables (particularly paper and plastics), which have already been classified as \u2018recycled\u2019 and counted towards UK and local targets, are being shipped to countries such as China, where we do not know whether they are actually recycled or merely used as cheap fuel.\nThere are several modern EfW technologies which have now moved on from the conventional EfW described above to become \u2018all-in-one\u2019 facilities for energy production and recycling. These are better known as Waste-as-Resource (WaR) facilities.\nAn integral part of a WaR facility is that it recovers as much energy as possible from the thermal process, which is usually a combination of combustion and gasification. Not only is a higher proportion of energy normally produced as electricity, but much of the thermal energy (waste heat) is recovered and used in district heating schemes and/or in the various industrial processes in the plant.\nA further objective in WaR facilities is to significantly reduce or eliminate sending ash to landfill. A WaR plant may incorporates a plasma vitrification system (for recycling wasted glass) which can take the \u2018fly ash\u2019 and safely encapsulate it in the glass product. A WaR plant also has an integrated concrete plant where bottom ash is used as aggregate in a variety of building and construction products.\nThe input and output data for a proposed WaR facility in Peterborough, UK is provided below: typical fuel mix for proposed peterborough war plant (1 million t/y):\nIndustrial/Commercial Waste\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,000 t/y\nMunicipal Solid Waste (MSW)\u00a0\u00a0 3,000 t/y\nSewage Sludge\u00a0\u00a0 90,000 t/y\nOil/Thinners (after recycling)\u00a0\u00a0 20,000 t/y\nLocally-grown Biomass\u00a0\u00a0 50,000 t/y\nNormal war plant annual outputs:\n\u2022 126 MW Electric Power NETT (>1.0 TWh)\n\u2022 Up to 58,000 m3 Concrete\n\u2022 145,000 tonnes Aggregates \u2013 block products\n\u2022 2,500 tonnes Non-ferrous metal ingots\n\u2022 30,000 tonnes Iron & Steel\n\u2022 50,000 tonnes Glass Products (tiles, filtration, enamel etc)\n\u2022 12,000 tonnes Hydrochloric Acid\n\u2022 Up to 4,000 tonnes Pure Sulphur\n\u2022 Up to 2 tonnes Pure Mercury\n\u2022 725,000 MWh Renewable Obligation Credits\n\u2022 1,300,000 tonnes Carbon Credits\n\u2022 ZERO output to landfill\nAt the public hearing in January 2006, following five years of hard work and significant investment by the developer, this highly innovative resource recovery plant was refused its planning application.15 going to war!\nThe Danish Connection\nMany of the most developed countries in Europe recognised the problems associated with landfill long before the UK did, and have been developing alternative processes for dealing with waste for several decades. The two main methods of landfill reduction are recycling and EfW.\nIn most European countries, it is normal to build EfW plants as part of the communities that they serve, so the waste from the community is used as fuel in the EfW plant, which then supplies electricity and heat back to the community. This is a very much healthier approach than that traditionally taken in the UK, where EfW plants are often hidden away and separated from their natural communities.\nAlthough most European nations do very much more EfW than the UK does, the most notable example of the intelligent use of EfW in Europe is Denmark.\nBecause most of Denmark is fairly densely populated and Danish people are more environmentally aware, landfill has not been considered an acceptable way of dealing with waste for many years. The Danes were also probably the first nation to recognise the resource potential of waste, rather than continue to treat it as an unfortunate problem as we have done in the UK.\nMost, if not all, EfW facilities in Denmark are built close to centres of population, so the waste journey is small (following the proximity principle) and, more importantly, so that the energy produced can be more readily utilised. The electricity produced is used in the local community as is the heat from the thermal process which is distributed in large-scale district heating (DH) systems.\nSo important is the utilisation of thermal energy from EfW that the Danes have become world leaders in designing pipelines to deliver heat to buildings over unprecedented distances (over 100 km) with negligible temperature drop. By doing this they have also generated an industry in the manufacture of equipment for DH schemes which is world-class.\nThere are about 400 individual DH schemes in Denmark, of which 350 are consumer-owned and 50 owned by municipalities; the latter, however, cover 60% of the heat supply, so those consumer owned are much smaller schemes.\nCase Study: Denmark In Most European Countries, it is normal to build efw plants as part of the communities that they serve.\nHistorical Development: Before 1979 \u2013 No Laws Regulating Heat Supply\n\u2022 First DH in Copenhagen in 1930\n\u2022 DH in larger cities during 1950s and 1960s\n\u2022 Oil crisis in 1973/74 and end 1970s\n\u2022 First heat supply act in 1979 \u2013 Planning introduced\nOverview Of Danish Energy Policy Development Goals:\n1970s Security of supply\n1980s Reduced import of fuel\n1990s Reduced environmental impact\n2000s Energy savings \u2013 CO2 targets\nDevelopment process:\n\u2022 Decentralised CHP became a major energy policy priority\n\u2022 Biomass and waste to be included as fuels for CHP\n1988\n\u2022 Ban on installing electric heat installations in new buildings \u2013 based upon a desire for more efficient energy utilisation\n\u2022 Extended in 1994 \u2013 not allowed to install electric heating installations in existing buildings with water-based central heating systems (protection of public supply areas: DH and gas)\nConversion Of DH Systems To CHP In Three Steps:\n\u2022 1990\u201394: Large coal-gas fired DH plants to natural gas CHP\n\u2022 1994\u201396: Remaining coal-fired DH to natural gas CHP, medium gas to natural gas CHP, DH outside gas area convert to biomass\n\u2022 1996\u201398: Smaller DH and apartment blocks (>3 MW) to convert to natural gas CHP\nSupport measures introduced:\n\u2022 Copenhagen DH systems to expand DH network (compulsory connection obliged)\n\u2022 Subsidies to electricity production on gas, biomass, waste, wind\n\u2022 Fixed electricity 3-tariff systems\n\u2022 Purchase obligations for CHP-electricity and wind power\n\u2022 Replaced by a new system in 2005 due to liberalisation of electricity market\nIs this a wasted opportunity?\nOur EU energy commitments for 2020 become more realistic and achievable if more of the UK\u2019s \u2018waste\u2019 is used as fuel resource in EfW plants, which can be designed to produce electricity, heat and/or transport fuels.\nOn the other hand, virtually any form of recycling requires energy input, which merely increases the UK\u2019s energy demand and therefore makes the 2020 targets, which are based on percentages of the total, even more difficult to achieve.\nIt should also be noted that the frequently made objection that recycling demands less energy than manufacturing from raw material is generally not valid, since the originally manufactured product will almost certainly not have been made in the UK and therefore does not appear in the UK\u2019s declared energy consumption or GHG emissions figures.\nAlong with other European countries, the UK has committed to climate change mitigation targets for 2020, although these are largely represented as CO2 emissions reduction targets, which is only one way of mitigating climate change, albeit an important one.\nThe very small penetration of energy produced from renewable resources in the UK (less than 2%), with nuclear currently representing only 5-6% of total energy, means that over 90% of all the UK\u2019s energy supply is provided from fossil fuels.\nSince fossil fuels are the biggest single contributor to climate change, it follows that increasing energy demand of whatever form will be largely supplied from fossil fuels and will therefore exacerbate, and not mitigate, climate change.\nEfW, on the other hand, and particularly the high biowaste fraction, is utilising a renewable resource as fuel and is, therefore, making a significant contribution to climate change mitigation.\nWhere do we put waste in the government?\nAs mentioned in this report, we have a growing pile of waste which needs dealing with. It is, therefore, a clear connection for most people to see the energy production and waste disposal issues as one which can help solve both problems.\nOne key reason for this is that Defra has traditionally been responsible for \u2018waste\u2019 issues, whereas BERR was responsible for \u2018energy\u2019. With the recent Cabinet reshuffle (October 2008), a new Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has been established, merging the energy parts of BERR with the climate change parts of Defra. As explained elsewhere in this report, waste should be regarded as a fuel rather than something which needs to be treated. If this philosophy were agreed, waste would also move from being solely a Defra consideration to being much more of a DECC responsibility. Until this key change is adopted, the waste/energy issues will always fall into the \u2018cracks\u2019 between the two Government departments.17 18_19 can we do what we promised?\nSo what needs to be done?\nWaste should be regarded as a fuel rather than something which needs to be treated.\nIn its most common form, the plant described as EfW will use the combustion process. There is currently in the UK no commercial incentive to build anything other than plants that produce electricity. In common with virtually any other thermal power station in the UK (fossil-fired or nuclear), the enormous amount of thermal energy (heat) produced by the process is simply wasted to the atmosphere. It is simple technology to capture much of this wasted heat and use it for space heating in a district \u2013 or community \u2013 heating scheme, as is commonly done in most other European countries. Traditionally, the primary objective in building such a plant in the UK is to achieve lowest cost and until this prevailing attitude changes (and a market for heat is created), there is unlikely to be any market inducement to alter this situation.\nHowever, in recent years the UK Government\u2019s commitment to eliminating fuel poverty has proven to be widely unsuccessful. Today, with energy costs continuing to rise (nearly 100% increase in costs in the last 12 months), fuel poverty is now on the increase. It is therefore astounding that so many near-continuous sources of heat energy are releasing this heat into the atmosphere. A long-term commitment to make use of this energy by developing community heat networks could offer a viable and direct solution to the fuel-poverty issue, alongside much needed and highly cost-effective measures to improve the insulation and thermal efficiency of our existing housing stock.\nSuch heat networks are not an immediate or cheap option and will require a long-term programme to implement a network to match that of many other European nations. However, this community/ regional programme would provide a sustainable economic benefit to construction and engineering companies, could be initially targeted at high fuel-poverty areas and resolve many local waste disposal issues throughout the UK.\nThe UK will never solve its waste issues solely by recycling \u2013 there is quite simply too much waste to deal with and too many waste streams that do not benefit from recycling.\nAdded to this are the continuing outdated and wrongful impressions that EfW systems are simply incinerators that pollute the surrounding areas.\nToday, we have the technologies and options available to segregate the waste streams which should be recycled, e.g. metals, from waste that can be used as a valuable and secure energy source. In addition, our addiction to landfills has provided many areas where EfW plants could potentially be constructed.\nA long-term reassessment and public education programme on the merits of recycling is required to allow EfW plants to be created to both generate energy for local communities and remove large amounts of waste being produced by the same communities. Looking further ahead, full-scale Waste-as-Resource plants would deal with the vast majority of what we currently still think of as \u2018waste\u2019.\nIt\u2019s time to put the myths and falsehoods aside and take a fresh look at what we do with our rubbish.\nLet\u2019s not waste any more time, let\u2019s not waste any more energy, and let\u2019s not waste the opportunity.\nThe time for Energy-from-Waste is now!\nA wasted solution to fuel poverty?\nRecycle the myths of recycling\nReferences\n"}, {"score": 606.2056, "uuid": "6802f5a6-0786-5f2c-82fd-ba09ce168163", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1813wb-80-12659", "target_hostname": "www.charitychallenge.com", "target_uri": "http://www.charitychallenge.com/corporates/responsible-tourism-you.html", "page_rank": 1.3176222e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Corporates - <em>What</em> you can do", "snippet": "If you <em>are</em> out for <em>the</em> day <em>and</em> no toilet is available please ask your challenge leader <em>what</em> <em>the</em> appropriate action is <em>and</em> ensure you don\u2019t leave any paper <em>waste</em> behind.

Participants are encouraged to enter into the spirit of adventure, but to do so with respect for the places and people you visit. For the truly responsible traveller this starts at home.\nremove all unnecessary packaging\nMany countries do not have the same refuse disposal systems as you are used to. A challenge can cause a\nsurprising amount of waste. We ask that you all do as much as possible to minimise this, and to see that rubbish is disposed of responsibly. Be particularly aware of the problems of disposing of batteries, if in doubt bring them home with you.\nread about the destination you are going to in advance\nKnowledge of the local culture and environmental issues will help you become a more sensitive traveller. See the Fact File for more information, and the reading list in the Q&A Sheet for your challenge.\nlearn a few words of the local language\nA few well-chosen words will go a long way. If you are able to communicate even at a very modest level you will feel more comfortable in the environment you are in and put your hosts at ease. Basic words are included in the Q&A sheet.\nraise money for a local charity\nIf you would like to take part in one of our challenges and would like to raise money for a local cause in the country that you are visiting, you can support one of the many UK or Irish registered charities who work\ninternationally. This way, the funds you raise will benefit the host country. Visit the Associated Charities section on our website and click through to the charities listed under International Aid.\nwhat you can do whilst on the challenge\nDuring the challenge is when you will have the biggest influence on the environment, so this is your chance\nminimise the negative impact and to make it as positive as possible for all involved.\nbe conservative with water\nIn many places, water is a scarce resource and without careful use, local people and wildlife suffer. We always\nprovide a generous amount of clean drinking water on our challenges, so you do not need to continually buy bottles of water, which generates a huge number of plastic bottles which are often buried, as recycling facilities are not available. When cleaning your teeth turn the water tap off whilst you are brushing. Dirty water used from washing either yourself or dishes should be scattered on the ground 100ft away from river sources if a drain is not available. Do not use non biodegradable soap in lakes or streams.\ndon't leave rubbish behind\nPlease take it with you. Your rubbish is not often biodegradable, is always unsightly, and may take years to\nbiodegrade especially in desert or mountain environments. In some instances rubbish can cause great harm to\nwildlife. It may seem that local communities have little regard for their environment and contribute heavily to the problem of rubbish, but waste disposal is often very limited. Please don\u2019t let our presence add to these problems. Please carry your rubbish with you and dispose of it at the next camp or town you come to. Try and leave the area as you would want to find it, this may include picking up other people's rubbish at your camp site. Try to use the same water bottle without buying new ones each time yours has run out.\nsmoking\nIf you must smoke, you should collect the matches and cigarette butts when finished and put them in your pocket and dispose of them properly when you get to camp. Not only does it present a fire risk, cigarette butts take many years to decompose and may harm local wildlife.\nnoise\nNoise should be kept to a minimum so as not to disturb the animals, or any other game watchers. Animals should not be touched, goaded, fed or disturbed in any way. Don\u2019t try to approach animals as this may cause them to panic and injure themselves as they run away. On tours where animals are used for transportation we aim to ensure that animals are well looked after, are fed well and given realistic loads to carry\ndamage\nTry not to damage any plant life, which you come across. This includes not picking flowers, which might be rare.\nWhen trekking, follow your guides and keep to the path. Going off the beaten track could result in damaging\nsensitive soil and vegetation. Removing coral damages the marine ecosystem and is nearly always unsustainable. If you are near coral, please bear in mind it is made up of tiny animals and takes centuries to grow. Treading on coral can cause severe long-term damage.\ngifts\nIf you wish to take gifts of books or pens for use in schools, please ask your challenge leader how this can be done in a fair and responsible way. It may be possible to visit a school at some point in the challenge that Charity Challenge supports through client donations. Buying products made from endangered species threatens their existence. Remember, in most cases it is illegal to import into the UK products from elephant ivory, rhino horn, furs, endangered tree species, butterflies, orchids, cacti, coral, sea turtle products, snake skin and wild game meat. Similarly, when on the beach, don't buy shells because that encourages the seashell trade. Do not be tempted to buy ancient artifacts such as pottery, which possibly were stolen from graves or unexplored tombs etc. Be aware that some goods may be manufactured through child labour.\naccommodation\nMost challenges begin and end in a hotel. When you stay in at your hotel please turn off air conditioning and lights when you are not in the room. Also ask the challenge leader to talk to hoteliers about towel washing option and please use the towels more than once rather than asking for (or allowing) them to be washed every day.\ntoilets\nMany of our challenges will take you off-the-beaten track, there are often a lack of toilet facilities. On treks it is unlikely you will have a flushing toilet. Instead a toilet tent will be erected and a pit dug. The pit should be dug at least 30m away from any water sources, and any paper rubbish should be collected and burnt, not buried. If you are out for the day and no toilet is available please ask your challenge leader what the appropriate action is and ensure you don\u2019t leave any paper waste behind. Where a toilet is provided, please use it, as opposed to finding your own rock to crouch behind. Only if there is no risk of fire use toilet paper and burn it but ask the challenge leader first.. Toilet paper is unsightly and takes a long time to break down.\nsocial impact\nAs well as impacting upon the physical environment, tourism can have a huge and lasting impact on the people and culture of the country you are visiting. By following local guidelines and by being respectful of culture and traditions, you will gain as much out of the challenge as possible and hopefully leave behind a positive impression.\nyou may be confronted by extremes of wealth and poverty\nUnfortunately, beggars are a fact of life \u2013 some are genuine, others are trying to cash in on the tourist trail. Whether you give money or gifts is a personal matter. If you give anything to any local people, try not to be 'condescending', e.g. don't throw pens out of the vehicle to children as you pass a village. Don\u2019t give sweets to children. Although it may seem as though you are giving them a treat, many countries we visit have little or no dental care, and by giving sweets you are contributing to their tooth decay. It will also encourage children to beg and s ee tourists as little more than a source of sweets and treats. Don\u2019t show off your relative wealth, with displays of money and material goods such as camera equipment or jewellery. It\u2019s not only making you a potential target to be robbed but is also highlighting the poverty gap that may exist between yourselves and those in the host country.\ntipping\nTipping is perfectly acceptable and can form the base of the local economy, with some relying mainly on tips. Your challenge leader will advise you on tour when and how much is appropriate, and refer to your Q&As. Please feel free to take with you pens books, pencils etc but please give them to your challenge leader to distribute and not directly to children or communities you meet as this may build expectations and can create problems for future travellers.\nbargaining\nPrices are generally low due to low wages and poor working conditions. Only start to bargain if you intend to buy, as it\u2019s not fair to knowingly mislead a hardworking vendor. When bargaining for goods, please bear in mind that 10 cents is nothing to you, but might be a lot to the vendor. Always have a figure in mind that you think is fair to pay and don\u2019t feel aggrieved if you find the same product for less. Don\u2019t get angry or aggressive when bargaining remember the vendor is just trying to make a living, even though it may be at your expense.\nlocally made goods\nDo not buy endangered plants, animal skins, or anything made from cacti, coral, shells, starfish, ivory, fur or\nfeathers. We encourage you however to buy locally made goods and crafts and seek out shops or markets that\nwork as co-operatives. This means that a fair amount is paid to the producers and discourages mass-production. You may also be able to buy more unique goods and souvenirs. When in markets or busy areas, avoid public displays of wealth such as watches, rings, jewelry and ipods. The golden rule of traveling is if you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t take which is especially true for jewellery.\nrespect\nRespect local customs and follow high standards of courtesy. Treat images of the heads of state with respect. Be aware of the differences in social behaviour and behave appropriately. Standards of acceptable behaviour vary greatly from place to place, and people of developing countries can often be easily shocked by 'western' behaviour. Displays of intimacy are often considered not suitable in public. Don\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep. So if you say you are going to write, do. Learn some words in the local language to help make contact and conversation.\nphotography\nAsk permission before taking someone's photo. Many people don\u2019t like having their photo\u2019s taken and there may be religious reasons for this. Don\u2019t pay children for photos\u2019 as it will encourage them to beg. If they have the opportunity to go to school they may not to be so willing to do so if they can make money from tourists by looking cute. Be cautious when taking photos of bridges, official buildings, persons in uniform, planes and airports, or religious buildings and ceremonies. Ask your challenge leader for advice if unsure.\nphysical contact\nAcceptable physical contact and body language varies in different destinations. Knowing the social norms in the\ndestinations you are travelling through will help you to avoid embarrassing situations and enhance your chances of meeting the locals.\nlocal dress code\nObserve the local dress code in the areas in which you are travelling, e.g. cover up in holy places. Local people can feel deeply offended when visitors do not observe the dress code and this can also cause unwanted attention. Respect property and their surroundings. Leave places you visit as you found them, or even better. Ensure you know the appropriate behaviour for the situation you are in, for example, ask your tour leader if it is essential to remove your shoes before entering a building.\ntreat local staff with respect and humility\nNo matter what their role is on your challenge. We aim to ensure every person involved in the challenge has a fair wage and has the right to work in safe conditions. As members of the International Porter Protection Group (IPPG) that sets guidelines and working conditions for porters, we aim to ensure the porters we use are treated in an acceptable way and paid fairly. Visit the IPPG website for further details www.ippg.net about porters\u2019 rights and working conditions or talk to your challenge leader.\ndon\u2019t have any involvement with drugs or prostitution\nNot only are both illegal in most countries we visit, but the trade presents real dangers for the people involved,\nmany of whom are forced to do so against their will.\nwhat you can do post-challenge\nIf you promise to send photos back to someone please ensure you do so. This is an excellent way of sharing a\npositive interaction and many locals love to see themselves in print.\n"}, {"score": 604.85516, "uuid": "7a961378-1a54-5eba-9ae7-254d4e3eee08", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1703wb-20-11538", "target_hostname": "plasticsandtheplanet.com", "target_uri": "http://plasticsandtheplanet.com/archives/category/basics/page/2", "page_rank": 1.1730226e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Basics | Plastics <em>and</em> <em>the</em> Planet - Part 2", "snippet": "Plastics may not be <em>the</em> Enemy \u2013How we use them might.

Menely School, Nevada GRADE LEVEL: 6 Environment UNIT OBJECTIVE: TO USE DATA GATHERING, COLLECTION, AND EVALUATION AS A DISCOVERY LEARNING METHOD TO EXPOSE STUDENTS TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL, POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS, AND TO ASSIST THEM IN CLARIFYING AND COMMITTING TO THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES AND CHOICES. INTRODUCTION ONE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT APPEARS TO NEED IMMEDIATE ATTENTION IN NEVADA IS THE PROBLEM OF SOLID WASTE. IN MY IMMEDIATE AREA OF GARDNERVILLE, THE PUBLIC LANDFILL IS ABOUT TO CLOSE, ALL THE NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD AREAS ARE AGAINST HAVING A NEW ONE IN THEIR OWN BACK YARD, AND SOME OF THE USERS ARE TRYING TO GET OUT OF PAYING FOR ITS CLOSURE. THE ACCESS ROAD TO THE DUMP IS LITTERED WITH TRASH AS MANY INDIVIDUALS REFUSE TO COVER THEIR LOADS AND SPEW IT OUT ALL ALONG THE HIGHWAY ENROUTE TO THE DUMP SITE. THERE ARE EVEN SOME CITIZENS THAT FEEL THE NOMINAL FEE CHARGED IS A BURDEN. THESE ARE PROBLEMS CREATED BY IGNORANCE, AND POOR ENVIRONMENTAL ATTITUDES. I BELIEVE EDUCATION CAN CHANGE ATTITUDES FOR THE BETTER. I TEACH 6TH GRADE AND HAVE NOTICED MANY WASTEFUL ATTITUDES FROM MY YOUNG CHARGES, AS WELL. THEY THROW AWAY NUMEROUS SHEETS OF PAPER, OFTEN BARELY USED, CONSUME THEIR AVAILABLE RESOURCES WITHOUT A THOUGHT OF WHETHER IT IS RENEWABLE OR NOT, AND WHEN READING OR HEARING ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS PERCEIVE EITHER THAT IT IS NOT THEIR PROBLEM, OR THAT SURELY \"I CANNOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE.\" AT THE END OF THIS UNIT I HOPE THAT EACH STUDENT WILL ACCOMPLISH THREE THINGS: BE ABLE TO GATHER AND INTERPRET DATA, ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR BEING A MEMBER OF AN INTERRELATED AND FRAGILE ENVIRONMENT, AND DEMONSTRATE A WILLINGNESS TO PERSONALLY \"MAKE A DIFFERENCE.\" I FEEL THAT KNOWING THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE RAISES THEIR SELF- ESTEEM AND WILL GIVE HOPE TO A GENERATION THAT HAS INHERITED A FRAGILE WORLD THAT IS SUFFERING FROM ABUSES. THE MOTIVE FOR DOING SO IS ALREADY BUILT IN WITH THEIR NEW KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR INTERDEPENDENCY, AND THEIR PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS IMPROVE WITH PRACTICE AND THE SUPPORT OF THEIR PEERS. INTEGRATED UNIT ON SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL LESSON 1- ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS OBJECTIVE: The student will describe an environment and be able to give an example of a 4-step food chain as an example of interdependency between plants, animals, and man. ACTIVITY 1- DISCOVERY WALK (open question) What are some of the things that you think of when I say \"environment?\" ... all responses can be put on the overhead or chalkboard. Accept all responses non- judgementally. Also could have pictures of various types of environments to hang up during/after the discussion such as seashore, desert, forests, mountains, villages, large cities, etc. (focus question) Think about the last time you were in one of these environments. What things did you see, hear, touch, smell? Which things did you like/dislike ? Take a walk though an environment such as a wooded area near your school. Remind students that each of them might see something different and to look for the one thing that is special to them. While there students might record on a worksheet: a. list 3 things that they saw, 3 heard, 3 touched, 3 smelled b. list animals, or evidences of animals seen c. list people, or evidences of man seen ART FOLLOW-UP - Have the students create a class mural of what they remembered of the environment they visited. DISCUSSION- Students share the items that they saw. Most of them will be plants, insects, and perhaps some animals. (interpretive question) How would you compare the living things we saw with humans ? (summary question) How could we put into one sentence what an environment is to someone who might not know what it is? The answer could be put up as a title over the class mural. ACTIVITY 2 - A MICRO-ENVIRONMENT In this activity students will sharpen their observation skills, take a \"closer look\" at a micro-environment and see its detailed structure. Have students cut a square out of a piece of paper so that it resembles a picture frame. a. Once outdoors they are to select a micro-environment. It might be the bark of a tree, the leaf littered ground, a stand of grass or leaves. b. Create a vocabulary list of the shapes, colors, textures and sizes of the objects they see inside their \"frame\" c. Finally, create a drawing of what is inside the frame FOLLOW-UP ... Students can generate a \"guess what I am\" bulletin board for the hallway with their framed drawings. The answer can be under a lift up tab. (This will resemble the pictures seen on the back page of World Magazine that are enlarged photos of real objects.) Have the students generate a list of vocabulary words from above, and put them on sentence strips around the display, or hang from the ceiling. ACTIVITY 3 - FOOD CHAINS, BALANCE OF NATURE (open question) What do living things need to survive? Challenge the students to name one living thing that doesn't need them. People need these things, too. a. In groups, have students brainstorm possible food chains. Each chain should have at least four links. Brighter students can be challenged to add a pollutant step in theirs. ... a sample worksheet page of food chains is given in the About Woodsy Owl Teacher Guide packet. b. Each group puts together a food chain of their own. Every member of the group draws a picture to represent their part of the chain. c. Once completed, each group mixes up the chain, paperclips it together in mixed up order, then hands it to the next group beside them. Every group now has a \"new\" food chain, and reassembles it into the correct order. The \"owner group\" can correct the finished order. (focus question) What do you notice about these relationships that is true? (interpretive question) How could we account for the fact that in some areas, the top of the food chain dies? the middle? example: all the coyotes that normally eat rabbits and mice disappear. (interpretive question) Do any species on earth seem capable of influencing their food chain or environment ? (summary question) Could anyone suggest one word or phrase that tells about the relationship between plants, animals, and man. LESSON 2 - EARTH AND ITS RESOURCES OBJECTIVE: The student will identify 4 natural resources and explain at least two consequences of the management of the resources. ACTIVITY 1 - NECTARINE/ EARTH MODEL Distribute one nectarine for each two students. Using the nectarine as a model of the earth, tell the students that this fruit has approximately the same ratio and proportion as our earth. Have the fruit already sliced in half, but not apart. Ask student A to twist apart the fruit and give half of the fruit to partner B. Discuss the facts that follow. l The nectarine skin is approximately the same thickness as our earth's crust. 2 The flesh of the fruit is equal to the mantle of the earth which is made up of molten rock and material. We only see the mantle when their is a crack in the earth's crust, such as in a volcano or earthquake. 3 The pit of the nectarine is about the same size as the core of our earth. Now the teacher holds up a whole nectarine. S/he says to the class, I'll ask a question. You must make a prediction and you and your partner tell each other your prediction, before I give the answer. (This predicting helps the student to be involved and \"want to know\" the answer.) a. How much of the earth's surface is covered with water? Cut away 3/4 of the nectarine. b. How much of the earth that is left can be lived on because it is not on the top of the mountain or in the middle of a desert ? Cut away 1/3 of what is left. c. How much of the earth that is left has a climate that is useful for growing our food as it has enough sunshine and moisture ? Cut off another 1/3. You should have about a large sliver left ! This is the part of the earth that all the animals and people must have to successfully survive. ACTIVITY 2 - NATURAL RESOURCES, RENEWABLE/ NON -RENEWABLE (open question) What are some of the things that living things need to survive? man ? Put all the answers on the board. (focus question) What do you notice about these items that are similar ? How could we group the similar items ? Have the students work in teams to identify ways to group the items from the board. Have them state the criteria for the choices. Then have each group share with the whole class. Help to direct the students toward the general categories of earth's natural resources. (focus questions) What things are renewable? Non- renewable? Does this make a difference? What happens if the non-renewable resources are used up? Though questioning strategies assist the students to discover that all the water that is on earth is constant, changes form, and is reused again and again. Contrast that with the idea that the amount of minerals/ metals in the soil , or the supplies of natural gas or petroleum is limited. When they are gone... they are gone forever. (summary question) How could we state a general rule that might be true about man's relationship to the earth's resources ? LESSON 3 - ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS, SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL CHOICES OBJECTIVE: student will identify 3 ways solid wastes can be disposed ACTIVITY 1 - LITTER HUNT, \"FOUND ART\" (open question) What are some of the things that you see when you go camping ? hiking? for a walk at the seashore ? (focus question) Which of the items you saw were man- made? Were all of the man made things meant to be there ? (litter is not) Each child needs a paper grocery bag and a sample \"litter hunt worksheet\" like the one in the Woodsy Owl Teacher Packet. The students could label their bags... \"Goodbye Litter.\" Their job is to pick up anything that was not intended to be there that is made by man. a. After the collection, each child spreads out newspapers and sorts their collection into categories and counts the items. b. Have small groups of students join together and make a graph of their common items. All members of the group needs to come to some agreement as to the categories. Pie graphs, bar graphs or line graphs could be used. A classroom graph is a possibility, too. FOUND ART - Litter or \"found\" art. Each child may take back their own litter items. Provide each child with a piece of tagboard, a large piece of aluminum foil, and glue and/or staples. Each child distributes their \"art selections\" onto the tagboard. When they are satisfied with the arrangement, have them glue, or staple each item in place. Next, place a piece of aluminum foil over the whole project, folding the edges down and to the backside. Press down the foil, in and around all the items. It will wrinkle, fold, and crease into an interesting texture. To antique or \"age\" the art piece, it can be brushed over with an India ink solution. Once dry, it is ready to frame and hang. (focus question) How do you think that area where we got our litter will look in 10 years? 25 years? (intepretive question) Can we compare and contrast our feelings about that area before and after we gathered the litter? ACTIVITY 2 - BACK TO THE EARTH ECO-EXPERIMENT, BIODEGRADABLE? You'll need an apple core, a leaf of lettuce, some plastic packaging, a piece of styrofoam, a small shovel. Find a spot to dig a few holes, such as a far corner of the school yard. (with permission, of course) Dig four holes wide and deep enough to put something in. Put one item in each hole, and fill them back in. Mark the spots that you've buried. In one month, go back and dig them up. You'll have no trouble finding the plastic and styrofoam, but the lettuce and maybe the piece of apple will be gone. Note. The lettuce and apple core are biodegradable; they can become part of the earth again. The other items are man made. They are from the Earth's resources, but we have changed them into something else that cannot become a part of the earth again. (This is from 50 Simple Things Kids Can Do To Save The Earth, pg 140-141) ACTIVITY 3 - GRAPHING PROJECT, HOW LONG RUBBISH LASTS Pass out the litter graph that depicts how long the various types of litter lasts from the Return, Recycle, and Use Less packet. Have students research the average life span of man. Now it will be really startling to the students to have them put these facts into a graph. ACTIVITY 4 - ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM WORKSHEET, QUICKIE WAY (focus question) We know that litter is a form of solid waste, and we humans have a tremendous amount of waste. What could we do to find out how big the problem is? Have students brainstorm in groups things that they could do to collect data on waste products and how much of a problem it is. Then come together as a class with their suggestions. Possibilities are: land fill visits weighing and counting trash newspaper articles interview parents magazine articles interview community leaders The students will gather data at home, school and on the community level. Through the use of this worksheet students will find out how extensive this problem is, if it is a local or national issue, who is impacted, and the what, where, who, and why of this ecological problem. Following are suggestions: a. Students will collect articles from local and national newspapers, and magazines. b. Have students compose a list of questions for use in interviewing fellow students, adults, and community leaders. Interview assignments can be given. c. HOME - Collect your own trash at home for one week. Weigh it, then sort it into categories and count. Find the class average. d. SCHOOL - Get permission from your principal to weight, sort, and categorize the school trash for one week. Compile the data into a usable form. e. COMMUNITY - Be a junk food detective. (from 50 Simple Things Kids Can Do, pg 148-149) Divide the class into groups. Have as many groups as the fast food restaurants you plan to visit. Buy the lunches, eat the food, but save the bags, plastic and paper wrapping, napkins, styrofoam containers, etc. Figure out which restaurants sold you the most garbage with your lunch. Categorize and count items. Bag each groups separately for a visual picture. Weigh them. Compile the data into a usable form. (summary question) Based on our research, how could we put into one sentence what we have learned ? or... What word describes your feelings about this research ? LESSON 4 - ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS OBJECTIVE : Student will identify 3 things they can do to help manage solid waste disposal, on a personal, school, and community level. (focus question) What have you noticed about the attitudes of people that you have interviewed concerning solid waste ? ACTIVITY 1 - THINKING BEYOND An activity from 50 Simple Things Kids Can Do book, pg 150 describes a survey the class can conduct to discover that people are so caught up in their personal lives, and friends, that they just don't \"think about\" other important things. Ask your friends to close their eyes and imagine a time last week when they were doing their \"best thinking.\" Ask them to write down 10 things they were thinking about doing at that time, and when they were thinking about doing them. For example: Were they thinking about eating dinner that night? Or seeing friends on Saturday? Or going to the movies next week? Everyone puts a mark where each of their then thought belong. See the example on the next page. _______________________________________ World _______________________________________ National /Ethnic group _______________________________________ City/state _______________________________________ Friends /Neighborhood X _______________________________________ Family _______________________________________ tomorrow next few life children's week years time life time Students will find that everybody's thoughts center around the things that are closest to us and events that will happen soon. We are not used to thinking about the environment. Even if we care about the Earth, we hardly ever think about it. But with practice, we can! ACTIVITY 2 - ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES AUCTION Provided in our binder in the miscellaneous section is a values auction that students can use to make an identification of their own values beliefs. 20 items are going to the highest bidder. I would have students fill it out and then compare with their neighbors, or perhaps their group to see the differences. I expect that they will all be surprised to see the various choices and that what they perceive to be the highest value item, may be lower on their neighbor's list. Whether you actually do the auction or not is not of importance to me; but the process of making the decisions and supporting my choices is the valuable part of the lesson. ACTIVITY 3 - DATA GATHERING The time has come for the students to become aware of the methods of solid waste disposal that are used in the world, such as burying, incineration, recycling, etc. I have gathered a variety of materials for the class ranging from Return, Recycle, and Use Less ... to Recycle Nevada. The class will be required to form small groups and the reading material will be distributed evenly. They can also be given access to whatever is available in the library resources. Their job is: a. Each person is to read and take notes from their share of the provided material for disposal methods used in our homes, communities, state, or nation. I would suggest they use a different page for each heading, and a note or phrase as to its source in case they want to refer to it later. b. When all the research is exhausted, the students come together into small groups to share the material. The goal of each group is to digest all the data into reasonable ways to dispose of trash in each area. The group should compile all the data in a method that can be shared with the class as a whole. c. Now the class comes together as a whole, and shares the data. All the ideas will be listed on the chalkboard under the appropriate headings. The goal of the class is to identify all the ideas gathered, and reduce the possible choices to the most reasonable 5 (or some number that seems reasonable to the class). I'm sure that this will present some lively discussions/arguments, as the students argue the merits of each system, from the research they have concluded. d. The last part of this research is to put the data into a table, graph, or other usable form. ACTIVITY 4 - CHOICES AND COMMITMENT An excellent resource for this part of the unit is 50 Simple Things Kids Can Do To Save The Earth. (interpretive question) Can you compare and contrast your opinions about solid waste disposal before and after our research? a. As a class, list all the things that could be done at home to help manage the problem of solid waste disposal. Examples might include sorting the trash, recyling when buying items, recycling what is still usable. b. As a class, list all the things that could be done at school. Examples might be to pick a spot to adopt, beautify, and maintain. Another might be to investigate the possibility of changing from using foam trays in the lunchroom to using reusable trays. It could be as simple an idea as using up both sides of school paper, and providing a box to store paper that has one usable side left for reuse as scratch paper or practice work. c. As a class, list all the things that could be done in your community such as a letter writing campaign, being an informed voter, working on a program to get additional recycling available locally. d. The class is now invited to select one to three of the choices presented and to write down their commitment on a 3x5 card that is titled, \"I Can Make a Difference.\" This can be taken home and hung on the refrigerator, taped inside their desk, etc. Students are invited to share their commitments with the class orally. The class could be invited to applaud after each commitment is read. (the last section of this activity is its own conclusion or summary) CONCLUSION This ends the unit but in my mind is a beginning. At this point I would survey my class and allow them to decide together if we are finished or if they want to pursue a particular issue as a class. Some of the activities I have considered include: * a letter writing campaign to retailers, community leaders, etc. concerning our research, what we would like to see change, and the desired outcome we are working towards. * selecting something at the school site that we would like to change, improve, or prevent. It might be getting rid of foam trays, or adopting a site for beautification. * changing something in the classroom, such as a recycling box for half used paper, or aluminum can recycling, or a newspaper recycling drive to raise money for classroom goals. * presenting our research data to the parents, in a \"parents night\" program where our class provides skits, plays, etc. and enlist their support in making at least one small change in their own homes to \"make a difference.\" I also have several other ideas for units that I did not put together here, but would like to put together soon. Some of the activities include the Adopt a Tree Program, the Archaeologist Rubbish Research activity listed under the E.E.Programs section of our binder, and more eco- experiments like making your own recycled paper (and writing your own nature poetry on it) from 50 Simple Things Kids Can Do To Save The Earth. I will also continue to add pamphlets, books, and articles to my school library on environmental issues and updates.

If the beverage packaging sector failed to meet these quotas, a mandatory deposit on non-reusab\u00adle, non-ecologically advantageous beverage packaging was to be introduced. The reusable quota for drinks rose in 1992 and 1993, but the trend has been downwards since 1994 and in 1997, the reusable quota failed to meet the prescribed 72%.

During 2007, a reported 12,774,774 tonnes (71.8%) of construction and demolition waste was recovered and 974,934 tonnes (5.4%) was disposed at authorised landfills and at waste permitted facilities.\nThere continues to be a large discrepancy between the reported collection of construction and demolition waste and its reported disposal and recovery. In 2007, there was a gap of 4,042,037 tonnes. Local authorities have stated that of 3,686 collection permit holders active in their areas, only 2,414 provided an annual environmental report for 2007, a 65% reporting rate. Local authorities estimate that non-reporting collection permit holders collected up to 633,000 tonnes of construction and demolition waste. Of active permitted (recovery) sites, only 770 reported from a total 1,688 active sites, a reporting rate of 45%. Local authorities estimate that non-reporting facility permit holders handled over 1,300,000 tonnes. This still leaves a gap of over 2,000,000 tonnes of waste and this in all likelihood represents a general lack of attention by the construction and demolition industries, and elements of the waste industry serving it, of the need to keep good records and provide reports to local authorities.\nTable 19 shows that the reported recovery rate for construction and demolition waste decreased to 71.8% in 2007 (from 79.5% in 2006 and 86.9% in 2005).

The reusable quota for drinks rose in 1992 and 1993, but the trend has been downwards since 1994 and in 1997, the reusable quota failed to meet the prescribed 72%.

[ Footnote 1 ] Biodegradable materials in landfill sites release emissions to the air which are harmful to the environment and emissions to the soil and water which can be harmful to health. [ Footnote 2 ] (See paragraphs 1.1 and 1.4).\nLocal authorities in the United Kingdom rely much more on landfill for municipal waste disposal than many other European countries. According to performance data for 2003, 75 per cent of municipal waste (equivalent to 17.7 million tonnes of biodegradable municipal waste) was landfilled in the United Kingdom, compared to 38 per cent in France and 20 per cent in Germany. Provisional Departmental figures for 2004-05 for England indicate that the amount landfilled has fallen from 72 per cent in 2003-04 to 67 per cent. [ Footnote 3 ] The United Kingdoms historic reliance on landfill left it poorly positioned in relation to many European countries who have already achieved their targets to reduce their reliance on landfill, partly due to geological, cultural and historic differences in approach to waste management. Our consultants, SLR Consulting, suggested six common features of countries that had made greater progress:\na greater acceptance of energy from waste as an alternative method of waste disposal;\ntimely and clear promotion of preferred alternatives to landfill;\nencouraging investment in facilities through strategic planning and clear guidance on measurement of waste and operating standards of facilities;\nprovision for municipalities to charge for waste collection;\ncomparatively high landfill costs through taxes or high industry costs;\ninfrastructure development risks shared between private investors and central or local Government.\n(See paragraphs 1.2, 2.5-2.7)\nThe European Union Directive targets require a considerable reduction in the use of landfill by local authorities in England. The targets for the United Kingdom are to reduce by 2010 the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill to 75 per cent of that arising in 1995, with further reductions to 50 per cent by 2013 and 35 per cent by 2020. The majority of the reductions fall on local authorities in England and meeting the 2010 target will require a reduction of at least 3.5 million tonnes compared to the amount of biodegradable municipal waste landfilled in 2003-04, a further reduction of 3.7 million tonnes to meet the 2013 target, plus another 2.3 million tonnes for 2020. [ Footnote 4 ] The Departments Waste Implementation Programme, which consists of various initiatives to encourage alternative disposal methods, particularly recycling and the minimisation of waste produced, is intended to help local authorities meet these targets. In 2006, the Department is carrying out a major review of its 2000 Waste Strategy to see, amongst other things, what more needs to be done to meet the Landfill Directive targets. (See paragraphs 1.4-1.6)\nOverall conclusion\nThe Department has spent 336 million on initiatives to reduce reliance on landfill, which has contributed to an increase in the proportion of municipal waste being recycled in England from 13 per cent in 2001-02 to 23 per cent in 2004-05. Reductions in the proportion of biodegradable waste sent to landfill have, however, been offset by growth in the amount of waste produced. The value for money of the Departments initiatives depends in part on whether the United Kingdom meets targets imposed by the European Union. At this stage there is a significant risk that the targets will not be met, and failure to do so could result in the United Kingdom incurring fines for non-compliance. It is difficult to determine the extent of any fine at this stage but the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit suggested the United Kingdom could be fined up to 180 million a year. [ Footnote 5 ]\nAn emphasis on increasing recycling alone is unlikely to enable the European Union Directive on landfill to be met. The Department therefore needs to focus its resources towards helping the 25 waste disposal authorities sending the largest amounts of municipal waste to landfill to develop alternative waste treatment facilities, such as energy from waste plants, alongside encouraging more households to recycle and compost, and initiatives to minimise waste production. [ Footnote 6 ]\nOur findings in more detail\nIn April 2005 the Department introduced the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme to encourage local authorities to improve their waste management. Local authorities across England have been set limits on the amount of biodegradable municipal waste they can dispose of in landfill sites, in line with the European Union targets set for England as a whole. The Scheme allows authorities to trade allowances if they have excess or insufficient capacity. The Department has confirmed that it would impose penalties on each local authority of 150 for every tonne of biodegradable waste disposed by landfill in excess of its allowance. (See paragraphs 2.10-2.12)\nThe effectiveness of the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme will depend, in part, on the reliability of data from authorities and contractors. The Department reported that, by July 2006, all waste disposal authorities were using the system, with 120 of the 121 waste disposal authorities having completed returns for the first year of the Scheme (2005-06). There are still problems with the reliability of the data, however, and the Environment Agency has (at 10 July 2006) so far completed the first stage validation process for only 21 authorities for the first year of the Scheme. As of 10 July 2006 validation has not been feasible for 25 of the 40 waste disposal authorities in two tier areas because of the lack of data from some waste collection authorities in their areas (only waste disposal authorities are required to supply data under the Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003). [ Footnote 7 ] In Wales, where the Scheme started six months earlier, the Environment Agency found a 10 per cent discrepancy in returns between local authorities and operators figures. (See paragraphs 2.13 and 2.14).\nThere is a significant risk that local authorities in England will fail to reduce tonnages of biodegradable waste sent to landfill by enough for the United Kingdom government to meet the European Union targets for 2010 and 2013. Although the local authorities we contacted confirmed that waste management is a high priority, an Office of Government Commerce survey in 2005, with responses from over 70 per cent of English local authorities with waste disposal responsibilities, revealed that many have been slow to finalise their plans to divert waste from landfill. [ Footnote 8 ] On the basis of the existing facilities for managing municipal waste, and the planned facilities identified by the Office of Government Commerces survey of local authorities in 2005, we estimated that authorities would exceed total allowance limits for sending biodegradable municipal waste to landfill by approximately 270,000 tonnes in 2010 and by approximately 1.4 million tonnes in 2013. The consequent penalties imposed on local authorities could amount to 40 million in 2010, and 205 million in 2013. These results assume no further action is taken by local authorities beyond that already planned. In practice, though, the Department assumes local authorities will respond to the incentives in place, such as the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme, and the constraints, such as how long it takes to get new waste treatment facilities built, and take sufficient alternative courses of action to allow them to meet their allowance limits. (See paragraphs 3.4, 3.5, and Appendices 1 and 6).\nThe Departments modelling suggests that, to meet European Union targets, approximately 40 per cent of household waste should be recycled by 2010. This is likely to be difficult to achieve. According to published data, Englands recycling rate is much lower than that of leading European countries, though it has increased from 11 per cent of waste composted or recycled in 2001 to 23 per cent in 2004-05. [ Footnote 9 ] This compares to levels in 2001 of 41 per cent in Germany and 60 per cent in Austria. Some European countries use household charging schemes to encourage recycling and reduce volumes of waste requiring collection. [ Footnote 10 ]The Department has indicated that the Government plans to consider whether charging could be adopted in England. (See paragraphs 4.1, 4.2, 4.10 and 4.11)\nThe Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP Ltd) and the Departments Waste Implementation Programme have proved effective in encouraging local authorities and the public to recycle more. [ Footnote 11 ]The technical advice and support offered by the two groups is appreciated by the majority of authorities that receive it. WRAP has mounted national campaigns on the Departments behalf to raise awareness about recycling which have shown improvements in the proportion of people willing to participate in such schemes. And WRAP has introduced several schemes to encourage home composting. (See paragraphs 4.7 and 4.9).\nExisting efforts to encourage more recycling and composting have been offset by the growth in the tonnage of waste collected by local authorities. The Department provided local authorities with 336 million between 2002-03 and 2005-06, and offered advice to encourage greater recycling and composting of biodegradable municipal waste. Local authorities recycled an additional 2.5 million tonnes of municipal waste between 1996-97 and 2004-05. The increased recycling has been outweighed, however, by a 21 per cent increase in waste tonnage collected by authorities over the same period. Assuming that waste tonnage continues to increase by 1.5 per cent a year, the proportion of waste recycled or composted would have to increase from 23 per cent in 2004-05 to 40 per cent by 2010 and nearly 50 per cent by 2013. The Departments 2006 Waste Strategy Review accordingly proposes a national 2010 recycling and composting target of 40 per cent. (See paragraph 2.1, 4.1, 4.5)\nUntil 2003 the Department (and its predecessors) had been slow to develop a clear action plan on how local authorities could develop waste treatment plants. Our analysis indicates that, before the introduction of the Waste Implementation Programme in April 2003, earlier strategies lacked practical plans for reducing reliance on landfill. Until the introduction of the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme in April 2005, waste management targets set by government were not designed to deliver the level of diversion from landfill required by the European Union Landfill Directive. Our interviews with local authority staff confirmed that developing alternative methods of waste treatment required a much greater range of staff skills and experience than was needed to manage existing landfill contracts, and that they would welcome more detailed, specific advice on their schemes in addition to existing Departmental initiatives. The creation of the Waste Implementation Programme, and the work of WRAP, have improved matters but, as our consultants, SLR, found, progress depends on the commitment of local authorities to deliver their own plans. (See paragraphs 2.8-2.10, 3.11-3.13)\nMeeting the European Union targets will require the construction of waste treatment and recovery plants, such as mechanical and biological treatment and energy from waste plants, but difficulties in securing funding have contributed to delays. [ Footnote 12 ] The typical cost of building an energy from waste plant can be between 40 million and 100 million, and many local authorities have therefore opted to use the Private Finance Initiative to secure funding. Nine years after the first Private Finance Initiative deals were signed, though, only six authorities have treatment facilities in operation or under construction. [ Footnote 13 ] Our analysis found that it typically took two years to put the financing in place for such deals, compared to 10 months for standard contracts. (See paragraphs 3.18 and 3.19)\nSpeeding up the construction of facilities that provide an alternative to landfill, such as energy from waste plants, depends on addressing public concerns. Authorities planning to develop energy from waste plants told the Office of Government Commerce that they were allowing between six and 26 months to gain approval, although in practice some cases might take much longer. The Department, in conjunction with the Department for Communities and Local Government (formerly the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister), has issued revised guidance to speed up the planning process, but it will be several years before the full effects are realised. Although the Departments previously published study on health effects considered risks to human health from incineration were small by comparison with other known risks, 47 per cent of respondents to our public survey were concerned about the health risks from energy from waste plants. Such public concerns can lead to objections, so delaying planning permission for waste treatment plants. The Department has recently commissioned further research into the health effects of energy from waste plants. (See paragraphs 3.7, 3.8, 3.23-3.25)\nBy putting a greater focus on those waste disposal authorities sending the largest amounts of biodegradable municipal waste to landfill, the Department might improve the possibility of meeting the targets by providing better advice and deterring authorities from unnecessarily reinventing the wheel. The range and innovative nature of many proposed schemes increase the risk and uncertainty in the waste industry and financers, and, therefore, the prices charged. Twenty five local authorities are responsible for 50 per cent of municipal waste sent to landfill, and 19 of them face a considerable challenge in meeting their reductions. The Waste Implementation Programme is increasing its focus on major infrastructure projects, as recommended by the Office of Government Commerce, by: drawing together and improving public advisory services to local authorities through a new Waste Infrastructure Development Programme; modifying Private Finance Initiative criteria and guidance better to suit the waste market; strengthening links with the investment community; and developing an improved national overview of local authority infrastructure plans. [ Footnote 14 ] (See paragraphs 3.13 and 3.14)\nRecommendations\nThe Department should:\nPut a greater focus on those local authorities sending the largest tonnages of biodegradable municipal waste to landfill so that council staff can more readily draw on the Departments expertise as required.

(We will get into the details of the definitions elsewhere, but for the moment you probably already have a fair understanding of the distinction; think of a sample of salt (sodium chloride) as opposed to a solution of salt in water\u2014 a mixture of salt and water.)\nThe manufacturer probably claims that their peanut butter\nis \"pure\"; is it really what a chemist would call a \"pure substance\"?\nElements and compounds\nIt has been known for at least a thousand years that some substances can be broken down by heating or chemical treatment into \"simpler\" ones, but there is always a limit; we eventually get substances known as\nelements\nthat cannot be reduced to any simpler forms by ordinary chemical or physical means. What is our criterion for \"simpler\"? The most observable (and therefore macroscopic) property is the weight.\nThe idea of a minimal unit of chemical identity that we call an element developed from experimental observations of the relative weights of substances involved in chemical reactions. For example, the compound mercuric oxide can be broken down by heating into two other substances:\n2 HgO \u2192 2 Hg + O2\n... but the two products, metallic mercury and dioxygen, cannot be decomposed into simpler substances, so they must be elements.\nElements and atoms\nThe definition of an element given above is an operational one; a certain result (or in this case, a non-result!) of a procedure that might lead to the decomposition of a substance into lighter units will tentatively place that substance in one of the categories, element or compound. Because this operation is carried out on bulk matter, the concept of the element is also a macroscopic one.\nPainting by Joseph Wright of Derby (1734-97) The Alchymist in Search of the Philosopher's Stone discovers Phosphorus [ link ]\nThe\natom\n, by contrast, is a microscopic concept which in modern chemistry relates the unique character of every chemical element to an actual physical particle.\nThe idea of the atom as the smallest particle of matter had its origins in Greek philosophy around 400 BCE but was controversial from the start (both Plato and Aristotle maintained that matter was infinitely divisible.) It was not until 1803 that John Dalton proposed a rational atomic theory to explain the facts of chemical combination as they were then known, thus being the first to employ macroscopic evidence to illuminate the microscopic world.\nIt took almost until 1900 for the atomic theory to became universally accepted. In the 1920's it became possible to measure the sizes and masses of atoms, and in the 1970's techniques were developed that produced images of individual atoms.\nCobalt atom imaged by a scanning tunneling microscope [ link ]\nFormula and structure\nThe formula of a substance expresses the relative number of atoms of each element it contains. Because the formula can be determined by experiments on bulk matter, it is a macroscopic concept even though it is expressed in terms of atoms.\nWhat the ordinary chemical formula does not tell us is the order in which the component atoms are connected, whether they are grouped into discrete units (\nmolecules\n) or are two- or three dimensional extended structures, as is the case with solids such as ordinary salt. The microscopic aspect of composition is\nstructure\n, which in its greatest detail reveals the relative locations (in two or three dimensional space) of each atom within the minimum collection needed to define the structure of the substance.\nMacroscopic\nMicroscopic\nSubstances are defined at the macroscopic level by their formulas or compositions, and at the microscopic level by their structures.\nThe elements hydrogen and oxygen combine to form a compound whose composition is expressed by the formula H2O.\nThe molecule of water has the structure shown here.\nChemical substances that cannot be broken down into simpler ones are known as elements. The actual physical particles of which elements are composed are atoms or molecules.\nSulfur \u2013 the element in its orthorhombic crystalline form.\nThe S8 molecule is an octagonal ring of sulfur atoms. The crystal shown at the left is composed of an ordered array of these molecules.\n(No, they don't actually move around like this, although they are in a constant state of vibrational motion.)\nCompounds and molecules\nAs we indicated above, a\ncompound\nis a substance containing more than one element. Since the concept of an element is macroscopic and the distinction between elements and compounds was recognized long before the existence of physical atoms was accepted, the concept of a compound must also be a macroscopic one that makes no assumptions about the nature of the ultimate .\nThus when carbon burns in the presence of oxygen, the product carbon dioxide can be shown by (macroscopic) weight measurements to contain both of the original elements:\nC + O2 \u2192 CO2\n10.0 g + 26.7 g = 36.7 g\nOne of the important characteristics of a compound is that the proportions by weight of each element in a given compound are constant. For example, no matter what weight of carbon dioxide we have, the percentage of carbon it contains is (10.0 / 36.7) = 0.27, or 27%.\nMolecules\nmolecule\nis an assembly of atoms having a fixed composition, structure, and distinctive, measurable properties.\n\"Molecule\" refers to a kind of particle, and is therefore a microscopic concept. Even at the end of the 19th century, when compounds and their formulas had long been in use, some prominent chemists doubted that molecules (or atoms) were any more than a convenient model.\nComputer-model of the nicotine molecule, C10H14N2, by Ronald Perry\nMolecules suddenly became real in 1905, when Albert Einstein showed that Brownian motion, the irregular microscopic movements of tiny pollen grains floating in water, could be directly attributed to collisions with molecule-sized particles.\nFinally, we get to see one! In 2009, IBM scientists in Switzerland succeeded in imaging a real molecule, using a technique known as atomic force microscopy in which an atoms-thin metallic probe is drawn ever-so-slightly above the surface of an immobilized pentacene molecule cooled to nearly absolute zero. In order to improve the image quality, a molecule of carbon monoxide was placed on the end of the probe.\nThe image produced by the AFM probe is shown at the very bottom. What is actually being imaged is the surface of the electron clouds of the molecule, which consists of six hexagonal rings of carbon atoms with hydrogens on its periphery. The tiny bumps that correspond to these hydrogen atom attest to the remarkable resolution of this experiment.\nThe original article was publshed in Science magazine; see here for an understandable account of this historic work.\nThe atomic composition of a molecule is given by its formula. Thus the formulas CO, CH4, and O2 represent the molecules carbon monoxide, methane, and dioxygen. However, the fact that we can write a formula for a compound does not imply the existence of molecules having that composition. Gases and most liquids consist of molecules, but many solids exist as extended lattices of atoms or ions (electrically charged atoms or molecules.) For example, there is no such thing as a \"molecule\" of ordinary salt, NaCl (see below.)\nConfused about the distinction between molecules and compounds?\nMaybe the following will help:\nA molecule but not a compound - Ozone, O3, is not a compound because it contains only a single element.\nThis well-known molecule is a compound because it contains more than one element. [ link ]\nOrdinary solid salt is a compound but not a molecule. It is built from interpenetrating lattices of sodium and chloride ions that extend indefinitely.\nStructure and properties\nComposition and structure lie at the core of Chemistry, but they encompass only a very small part of it. It is largely the properties of chemical substances that interest us; it is through these that we experience and find uses for substances, and much of chemistry-as-a-science is devoted to understanding the relation between structure and properties. For some purposes it is convenient to distinguish between chemical properties and physical properties, but as with most human-constructed dichotomies, the distinction becomes more fuzzy as one looks more closely.\n[ image link ]\nPutting it all together\nThis concept map offers a good overview of the ideas we have developed so far. Take some time to look it over and make sure you understand all the terms and the relations between them.\nFor a more in-depth treatment of much of the material covered here, please see The basics of atoms, moles, formulas equations, and nomenclature .\nChemical change\nChemical change\nis defined macroscopically as a process in which new substances are formed. On a microscopic basis it can be thought of as a re-arrangement of atoms. A given chemical change is commonly referred to as a chemical reaction and is described by a chemical equation that has the form\nreactants \u2192 products\nChemical change vs. physical change\nIn elementary courses it is customary to distinguish between \"chemical\" and \"physical\" change, the latter usually relating to changes in physical state such as melting and vaporization. As with most human-created dichotomies, this begins to break down when examined closely. This is largely because of some ambiguity in what we regard as a distinct \"substance\".\nExample: dichlorine, Cl2.\nElemental chlorine exists as the diatomic molecule Cl2 in the gas, liquid, and solid states; the major difference between them lies in the degree of organization. In the gas the molecules move about randomly, whereas in the solid they are constrained to locations in a 3-dimensional lattice. In the liquid, this tight organization is relaxed, allowing the molecules to slip and slide around each other.\nSince the basic molecular units remain the same in all three states, the processes of melting, freezing, condensation and vaporization are usually regarded as physical rather than chemical changes.\nExample: sodium chloride, NaCl.\nSolid salt consists of an indefinitely extended 3-dimensional array of Na+ and Cl\u2013 ions (electrically- charged atoms.)\nWhen heated above 801\u00b0C, the solid melts to form a liquid consisting of these same ions. This liquid boils at 1430\u00b0 to form a vapor made up of discrete molecules having the formula Na2Cl2.\nSalt dissolves in water to form a solution containing separate Na+ and Cl\u2013 ions to which are loosely attached varying numbers of H2O molecules. The resulting hydrated ions are represented as Na+(aq) and Cl\u2013(aq).\nBecause the ions in the solid, the hydrated ions in the solution, and the molecule Na2Cl2 are really different chemical species, so the distinction between physical and chemical change becomes a bit fuzzy.\nEnergetics of chemical change\nYou have probably seen chemical reaction equations such as the \"generic\" one shown below:\nA + B \u2192 C + D\nAn equation of this kind does not imply that the reactants A and B will change entirely into the products C and D, although in many cases this will be what appears to happen. Most chemical reactions proceed to some inermediate point that yields a mixture of reactants and products.\nFor example, if the two gases phosphorus trichloride and chlorine are mixed together at room temprature, they will combine until about half of them have changed into phosphorus pentachloride:\nPCl3 + Cl2 \u2192 PCl5\nAt other temperatures the extent of reaction will be smaller or greater. The result, in any case, will be an\nequilibrium mixture\nof reactants and products.\nThe most important question we can ask about any reaction is \"what is the equilibrium composition\"?\nIf the answer is \"all products and negligible quantities of reactants\", then we say the reaction can takes place and that it \"goes to completion \".\nIf the answer is \"negligible quantities of products\", then we say the reaction cannot take place in the forward direction, but that the reverse reaction can occur.\nIf the answer is \"significant quantities of all components\" (both reactans and products) are present in the equilibrium mixture, then we say the reaction is \"reversible\" or \"incomplete\".\nThe aspect of \"change\" we are looking at here is a property of a chemical reaction, rather than of any one substance. But if you stop to think of the huge number of possible reactions between the more than 15 million known substances, you can see that it would be an impossible task to measure and record the equilibrium compositions of every possible combination.\nFortunately, we don't need to do this. One or two directly measurable properties of the individual reactants and products can be combined to give a number from which the equilibrium composition at any temperature can be easily calculated. There is no need to do an experiment!\nThis is very much a macroscopic view because the properties we need to directly concern ourselves with are those of the reactants and products. Similarly, the equilibrium composition\u2014 the measure of the extent to which a reaction takes place\u2014 is expressed in terms of the quantities of these substances.\nChemical Energetics\nVirtually all chemical changes involve the uptake or release of energy, usually in the form of heat. It turns out that these energy changes, which are the province of\nchemical thermodynamics\n, serve as a powerful means of predicting whether or not a given reaction can proceed, and to what extent. Moreover, all we need in order to make this prediction is information about the energetic properties of the reactants and products; there is no need to study the reaction itself. Because these are bulk properties of matter, chemical thermodynamics is entirely macroscopic in its outlook.\nDynamics of chemical change\nDynamics: kinetics and mechanism\nThe energetics of chemical change that we discussed immediately above relate to the end result of chemical change: the composition of the final reaction mixture, and the quantity of heat liberated or absorbed.\nThe dynamics of chemical change are concerned with how the reaction takes place:\nWhat has to happen to get the reaction started (which molecule gets bumped first, how hard, and from what direction?)\nDoes the reaction take place in a single step, or are multiple steps and intermediate structures involved?\nThese details constitute what chemists call the\nmechanism\nof the reaction. For example, the reaction between nitric oxide and hydrogen (identified as the net reaction at the bottom left), is believed to take place in the two steps shown here. Notice that the nitrous oxide, N2O, is formed in the first step and consumed in the second, so it does not appear in the net reaction equation. The N2O is said to act as an intermediate in this reaction. Some intermediates are unstable species, often distorted or incomplete molecules that have no independent existence; these are known as transition states.\nThe microscopic side of dynamics looks at the mechanisms of chemical reactions. This refers to a \"blow-by-blow\" description of what happens when the atoms in the reacting species re-arrange themselves into the configurations they have in the products.\n[ image link ]\nMechanism represents the microscopic aspect of chemical change. Mechanisms, unlike energetics, cannot be predicted from information about the reactants and products; chemical theory has not yet advanced to the point were we can do much more than make educated guesses. To make matters even more complicated (or, to chemists, interesting!), the same reaction can often proceed via different mechanisms under different conditions.\nKinetics\nBecause we cannot directly watch the molecules as they react, the best we can usually do is to infer a reaction mechanism from experimental data, particularly that which relates to the rate of the reaction as it is influenced by the concentrations of the reactants. This entirely experimental area of chemical dynamics is known as\nkinetics\n.\nReaction rates, as they are called, vary immensly: some reactions are completed in microseconds, others may take years; many are so slow that their rates are essentially zero. To make things even more interesting, there is no relation between reaction rates and \"tendency to react\" as governed by the factors in the top half of the above diagram; the latter can be accurately predicted from energetic data on the substances (the properties we mentioned in the previous screen), but reaction rates must be determined by experiment.\nCatalysts\nCatalysts can make dramatic changes in rates of reactions, especially in those whose un-catalyzed rate is essentially zero. Consider, for example, this rate data on the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. H2O2 is a by-product of respiration that is poisonous to living cells which have, as a consquence, evolved a highly efficient enzyme (a biological catalyst) that is able to destroy peroxide as quickly as it forms. Catalysts work by enabling a reaction to proceed by an alternative mechanism.\nIn some reactions, even light can act as a catalyst. For example, the gaseous elements hydrogen and chlorine can remain mixed together in the dark indefinitely without any sign of a reaction, but in the sunlight they combine explosively.\nCurrents of modern Chemistry\nIn the preceding section we looked at chemistry from a conceptual standpoint. If this can be considered a \"macroscopic\" view of chemistry, what is the \"microscopic\" view? It would likely be what chemists actually do. Because a thorough exploration of this would lead us into far more detail than we can accommodate here, we will mention only a few of the areas that have emerged as being especially important in modern chemistry.\nSeparation science\nA surprisingly large part of chemistry has to do with isolating one component from a mixture. This may occur at any number of stages in a manufacturing process, including the very critical steps involved in removing toxic, odiferous, or otherwise undesirable by-products from a waste stream. But even in the research lab, a considerable amount of effort is often devoted to separating the desired substance from the many components of a reaction mixture, or in separating a component from a complex mixture (for example, a drug metabolite from a urine sample) prior to measuring the amount present.\nDistillation - separation of liquids having different boiling points. This ancient technique (believed to have originated with Arabic alchemists in 3500\u00a0BCE), is still one of the most widely employed operations both in the laboratory and in industrial processes such as oil refining .\n[ image link ]\nSolvent extraction - separation of substances based on their differing solubilities. A common laboratory tool for isolating substances from plants and chemical reaction mixtures. Practical uses include processing of radioactive wastes and decaffienation of coffee beans . The separatory funnel shown here is the simplest apparatus for liquid-liquid extraction; for solid-liquid extraction, the Soxhlet apparatus is commonly used.\nWikipedia article on solvent extraction\nChromatography - This extremely versatile method depends on the tendency of different kinds of molecules to adsorb (attach) to different surfaces as they travel along a \"column\" of the adsorbent material. Just as the progress of people walking through a shopping mall depends on how long they spend looking in the windows they pass, those molecules that adsorb more strongly to a material will emerge from the chromatography column more slowly than molecules that are not so strongly adsorbed.\nsome biochemical applications -\nPaper chromatography of plant juice [ link ]\nGel electrophoresis - a powerful method for separating and \"fingerprinting\" macromolecules such as nucleic acids or proteins on the basis of physcal properties such as size and electric charge.\nIdentification and assay\nWhat do the following people have in common?\nA plant manager deciding on whether to accept a rail tank car of vinyl chloride for manufacture into plastic pipe\nAn agricultural chemist who wants to know about the vitamin content of a new vegetable hybrid\nThe manager of a city water-treatment plant who needs to make sure that the carbonate content of the water is maintained high enough to prevent corrosion, but low enough to prevent scale build-up\nThe answer is that all depend on\nanalytical techniques\n\u2014 measurements of the nature or quantity (\"assays\") of some substance of interest, sometimes at very low concentrations. A large amount of research is devoted to finding more accurate and convenient means of making such measurements.

Almost all plastic-coated paper products are coated by an impregnation process with low-density polyethylene (LDPE). This and other petroleum-based coatings used for these applications do not biodegrade. These products include milk and juice cartons, hot and cold paper drinking cups, frozen food containers, plastic-lined paper bags, take-out containers and some paper plates.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between macro- and micro-plastics?\nMacro-plastics have been defined as being greater than or equal to 5mm and micro-plastics have been defined as less than 1mm. For practical purposes in a composting process, macro-plastics can be defined as those that can be screened out and micro-plastics as those that pass through the screening process.\nMacro-plastic particles are introduced into the composting process from a variety of products such as plastic bags, plastic-coated paper products, diapers and other contaminants. These particles are larger than \u00bd inch in size and are generally removed from the composting process during screening. They do, however, add to the cost of processing compostable materials.\nMicro-plastic particles are smaller than \u00bd inch in size, and may be as small as 100 microns (a micron is one-millionth of a meter). Because of their small size, micro-plastic particles are not removed by the compost screening process and contaminate the finished compost. Eco-Cycle and Woods End research found all plastic-coated paper products tested were shedding micro-plastic particles into the compost during decomposition.\nWhy aren\u2019t plastics removed from compost during the screening process?\nMost composters use a \u00bd inch (12 mm) sieve to screen contaminants from their finished compost. This removes many common plastic contaminants such as plastic bags. Under dry conditions, a 3/8 inch (9 mm) sieve may be used. Particles smaller than the sieve size, such as micro-plastics, are not removed through the screening process and will contaminate the finished compost.\nBack to Top\nWhat guidelines do you recommend for composting facilities for accepting foodservice products and packaging?\nOnly certified tested products\u2014using ASTM 6400 , EN 13432 or the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) standards\u2014should be allowed in food waste collection programs. No other plastic-coated paper products should be accepted. Soiled paper products, such as tissues, paper napkins and paper towels, are suitable for composting. Paper products such as cardboard, office paper, shredded paper and uncoated paperboard do biodegrade but recycling these materials should be given highest priority. Milk and juice cartons should be recovered through recycling facilities.\nThe City of Seattle's guidelines (right) and Eco-Cycle's guidelines for Boulder County are good examples of programs that exclude plastic-coated paper products that are not certified compostable.\nShould I stop using compost?\nNo! Compost is an excellent soil amendment with numerous benefits:\nSuppresses plant diseases and pests\nReduces or eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers\nPromotes higher yields of agricultural crops\nImproves soil structure (tilth) which improves water holding capacity and erosion control, and improves drainage and permeability by keeping aeration channels open\nBuffers soil acidity\nFacilitates reforestation, wetlands restoration, and habitat revitalization efforts by amending contaminated, compacted and marginal soils\nCost-effectively remediates soils contaminated by hazardous waste\nRemoves solids, oil, grease, and heavy metals from storm water runoff\nCaptures and destroys 99.6% of industrial volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) in contaminated air\nOffers stronger protection against changing climate conditions.\nHowever, it is imperative we deploy best management practices to the growing number of compost collection programs in the U.S. and Canada in order to maintain the integrity of our compost and ultimately our soils. Learn more about the benefits of composting at www.cool2012.com .\nShould I stop composting?\nNo! Composting your food scraps and yard debris returns valuable nutrients to our soils and keeps organic materials out of landfills. Landfills are a top source of methane, a greenhouse gas 72 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Landfills can also contaminate groundwater and contribute to local air pollution. By composting in your backyard or through a curbside composting program, you\u2019re part of a win-win solution for our environment, our climate and our communities.\nBack to Top\nHow can I tell if a paper product is coated with a petroleum-based plastic?\nThere is no fail-safe method for determining whether a paper product is coated with petroleum-based plastic. There are far more manufacturers using polyethylene (PE) coating on paper products than a compostable PLA coating and these PE-coated products are much more readily available. While most PE-coated paper products are not marketed as compostable, they are accepted by many composting programs, or they may have misleading marketing claims such as \u201cbiodegradable\u201d or \u201cearth-friendly.\u201d Only products that meet ASTM 6400 , EN 13432 or BPI standards can be safely composted.\nCan I compost pizza boxes and paper towels?\nYes, pizza boxes, paper towels, tissues and paper napkins are safe for composting. These products, often referred to as \u201csoiled paper,\u201d are made entirely of paper fibers and can be composted in a home compost bin or through a curbside composting program. (Frozen pizza or other frozen food boxes and hand or surface wipes are not compostable.)\nCan I recycle plastic-coated paper products?\nMilk cartons and juice boxes can be recycled through many recycling programs across the U.S. and efforts are underway to expand these recycling options to all communities. To find out if these materials can be recycled in your local recycling program or to learn more about adding these materials to your recycling program, visit www.aseptic.org/cartons.html.\nOther plastic-coated paper products, such as paper cups, take-out food packaging and frozen food boxes, cannot be recycled. The same plastic coating that inhibits the decomposition process also makes these products difficult to recycle. The paper fibers cannot be separated from the plastic coating so these materials are a contaminant in the recycling bin.\nBack to Top\nWhat are oxo-biodegradable products and are they safe?\nOxo-biodegradable products are petroleum-based plastic products that are designed to disintegrate when exposed to heat and oxygen. These products are commonly used for plastic foam items, plastic carryout bags, film plastics and agricultural mulch films. These products do not meet composting standards and should not be included in composting programs. The environmental benefits of these products, as well as their ability to degrade or biodegrade, are all under debate. A series of recent tests by Woods End and Mother Earth News calls into question how well these bags actually fragment; after exposure to several months of hot, arid conditions, no fragmentation occurred. It is also under debate whether or not the fragmented plastics are eventually taken up by micro-organisms to be biodegraded, or if they remain in the environment.\nWhat is the difference between degradable and biodegradable products?\nConsumers often assume that a product labeled degradable is actually biodegradable.This is not the case. A degradable product disintegrates into smaller pieces when exposed to environmental conditions. It is not broken down completely unless it is biodegradable, and therefore, it will add to the growing problem of plastic pollution in the environment. Something that is truly biodegradable can be completely consumed or decomposed by living organisms, becoming beneficial to the environment.\nBeware of products that claim to biodegrade in 1 to 5 years.These claims are debated and any product that does not biodegrade in the normal 90 day cycle at a compost facility can do harm when released into an ecosystem. In addition, products made with a mix of non-biodegradable plastic and a compostable material (such as plant starch) should be avoided because the plastic fragments will remain after the compostable component decomposes.\nIsn\u2019t it okay to put biodegradable materials in a landfill?\nThe landfilling of organic materials such as food scraps, yard debris, paper products and compostable plastics produces methane, a greenhouse gas 72 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Landfills also produce a liquid leachate that can seep out and contaminate groundwater, and volatile organic compounds and other toxic substances that contribute to local air pollution. By composting our organic materials instead, we can replenish our soils with valuable nutrients, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs.\nBack to Top\nShould I stop eating seafood because it\u2019s contaminated by plastic?\nThere are no official advisories against eating seafood because of the presence of plastic particles in our oceans and marine life.\nWhich single-use products are compostable? When purchasing products, which labels should I look for and what questions should I ask?\nOnly products that meet ASTM 6400 , EN 13432 or BPI standards can be safely composted in a commercial-scale compost facility.Look for these labels or use the BPI website to find companies with compostable products. Avoid products that say \u201cbiodegradable\u201d or \u201ccompostable\u201d without any reference to a measurable standard.\nWe've pulled together a comprehensive list of BPI certified products , as well as some explanations of the different products and choices , to help you make the right decisions.\nWhat is the best choice for serving food and beverages?\nDurable, reusable tableware is the best choice for our environment and the most efficient use of our natural resources. For larger events or gatherings, you can rent these materials from event/party rental companies, or pick up your own supply cheaply at a secondhand store.\n"}, {"score": 576.70624, "uuid": "4a1ac3ee-061b-5267-8ccd-40b750b102de", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0909wb-43-17800", "target_hostname": "www.ecocycle.org", "target_uri": "http://www.ecocycle.org/microplasticsincompost/faqs", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "Microplastics in Compost FAQs", "snippet": "&gt; <em>What</em> is <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> degradable <em>and</em> <em>biodegradable</em> products? &gt; Isn\u2019t it okay to put <em>biodegradable</em> materials in a landfill? &gt; Should I stop eating seafood because it\u2019s contaminated by plastic? &gt; Which single-use products <em>are</em> compostable?", "explanation": null, "document": "> What is the best choice for serving food and beverages?\nWhat are plastic-coated paper products?\nPlastic-coated paper products are a common type of food packaging made from paper and coated with plastic to prevent liquid absorption or freezer burn, or to otherwise enhance product performance.

I\u2019ve edited it just a bit. It\u2019s designed to provoke design management students and show how I\u2019ve redesigned my job at Business Week from the Voice Of Authority to the Curator of the Conversation on Innovation. We all live life in beta now.\nAre Designers The Enemy of Design?\nIn the name of provocation, let me start by saying that DESIGNERS SUCK. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s true. DESIGNERS SUCK. There\u2019s a big backlash against design going on today and it\u2019s because designers suck.\nSo let me tell you why. Designers suck because they are arrogant. The blogs and websites are full of designers shouting how awful it is that now, thanks to Macs, Web 2.0, even YouTube, EVERYONE is a designer. Core 77 recently ran an article on this backlash and so did we on our Innovation & Design site. Designers are saying that Design is everywhere, done by everyone. So Design is debased, eroded, insulted. The subtext, of course, is that Real design can only be done by great star designers.\nThis is simply not true. Design Democracy is the wave of the future. Exceptional design may only be done by great star designers. But the design of our music experiences, the design of our MySpace pages, the design of our blogs, the design of our clothes, the design of our online community chats, the design of our Class of \u201995 brochures, the design of our screens, the design of the designs on our bodies\u00e2\u0080\u0094We are all designing more of our lives. And with more and more tools, we, the masses, want to design anything that touches us on the journey, the big journey through life. People want to participate in the design of their lives. They insist on being part of the conversation about their lives.\nSo Lesson One here is that the process of design, the management of the design process, is changing radically. Egos and silos are coming down, participation is expanding, tools are widespread and everyone wants to play. People want to be in the design sandbox so you have to figure out how to get them in and do design with them. This is a huge challenge.\nLet\u2019s talk about the arrogance of architects. When I began covering architecture a decade ago for Business Week, we launched an annual contest with Architectural Record. When we were about to publish pictures of the first winners, I looked at all the fancy architecture magazines. None had any pictures of people inside buildings. The buildings were all devoid of people. And most still are. We put people inside the spaces they inhabit. We inserted people into the conversation of their lives. Now, smart architects engage the masses in their designs. They hire firms who do social geography, showing how people really interact in organizations, not what their titles suggest. Informed with this information, they design spaces.\nSo one Big Design Management Challenge is how do you switch gears from designing for to designing with? Maybe the object of design is not a finished product but a set of tools that allow people to design their experiences for themselves. Think iPod and iTunes. Think TiVo. Starbucks. Fortunately, design has tremendous tools. In fact, design has evolved from a simple practice to a powerful methodology of Design Thinking that, I believe, can transform society. By that I mean Design, with a capital D, can move beyond fashion, graphics, products, services into education, transportation, economics and politics. Design can become powerful enough to be an approach to life, a philosophy of life. But it can do so only when Design by Ego ends and Design by Conversation begins. More on that later.\nBack to the backlash against design. Designers suck because they are also IGNORANT, especially about sustainability. The rap against designers is that they design CRAP that hurts the planet. That\u2019s the argument. Let\u2019s take your favorite toy, designed by one of today\u2019s design gods, Jonathan Ive and his team at Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0094the iPod. Apple does fantastic things with materials. Amazing things. And it has recycling programs for its products. But what it doesn\u2019t do is prioritize cradle-to-cradle design. It doesn\u2019t design a long-cycle product that you can open and upgrade over time. It doesn\u2019t design a process that encourages the reuse materials again and again. It doesn\u2019t demand sustainability.\nSo ask yourselves if you demand sustainability in your laptops, your iPods, cell phones, cars, or houses. There are mountains of computers and iPods and cell phones and stuff\u00e2\u0080\u0094your old stuff\u00e2\u0080\u0094building up in India and Chinas, leaking toxic chemicals. Greenpeace has launched a Green My Apple campaign. Europe tipped green in the 90s. The U.S. tipped green just last year.\nI actually think that of all the designers in the US design professions, architects are the greenest. Architects are the leaders in terms of sustainability. Building according to LEED specs is the norm for big corporations. Bank of America is putting up an incredibly green building near Bryant Park. One wonderful green trick\u2014 it uses cheap electricity at night to make ice in the basement to cool the skyscraper in the morning. Bring back the ice box .\nThe broad new paradigm for design\u00e2\u0080\u0094the paradigm you will all work within for the rest of your lives\u00e2\u0080\u0094is sustainability. When you have venture capitalists at the latest TED conference in Monterrey crying, literally crying onstage, about the planet, sustainability is hot, hot, hot. So the iPod is cool but\u2026..\nChallenge Your Assumptions. Think about the mink coat. It is beyond cool. It\u2019s sustainable. You feed those little rat-y things with garbage that you throw out or food you grow, you create something that is comfortable, beautiful and gives you warmth for your entire life, you pass it along to another generation or recycle it or simply let it disintegrate. It\u2019s organic, after all.\nAll you folks in fashion, try and rethink materials. Fashion is one of the most creative of the design fields\u00e2\u0080\u0094obviously. But what does it mean to design fashion within a sustainable context. I think it means changing materials. How can you fashion a fashion process, that focuses on bringing a new line out twice a year, that allows materials to be reused again and again in different ways? Or should designers try and design clothes that last far longer than one season or two? And why are organic materials, bamboo and cotton, so expensive? And how do you price for all of this. Hard questions.\nLet me stop and make a suggestion. Skip your next trip to Milan or Miami and head, instead, for the reservation. Visit the Navajo and Hopi, the Pueblo Indians, the Souix and the Cheyenne. These folks lived a sustainable lifestyle long before it became both fashionable and necessary. There\u2019s a lot left to their eco-culture. Learn from them\u00e2\u0080\u0094their contemporary artists in weaving, pottery, painting and jewelry are among the most innovative and creative in the world.\nTake the Navajo Hogan, a simple six-sided building. Hogans sit lightly on the land\u00e2\u0080\u0094no 10,000 or 20,000 square foot McMansions for the Navajo. Hogan are easy to assemble, use little energy to keep people warm, and have strong spiritual meaning to the families who inhabit them. Today\u2019s modern hogans are trailors and they are all over the rez. Now think about trailors. They, too, sit lightly on the land, are kind of prefab, and use little energy. In a world focused on sustainability, is the trailor worse than a cool building designed by Rem Koolhass or Frank Gehry?\nWe need to live the lives we design. Take Al Gore, one of my heroes. Does a great movie on global warming but does he walk the talk with a 20-room mansion and private jets? What is his real carbon footprint? Yes, he buys all kinds of carbon offsets, you know pay peasants in the Amazon to grow trees. But is that living a sustainable life. Can you buy your way to a carbon-free life there if you are rich? Both Davos and the Oscars were full of rich folks flying in on private jets leaving a big fat carbon footprint. Yet both conferences were allegedly CARBON-FREE. What\u2019s up with that?\nOK, enough. Now that I\u2019ve insulted designers, allow me to insult myself. In the 90\u2019s, I was the editorial page editor of Business Week. I was the VOICE OF AUTHORITY. Truly, they had an ad campaign revolving around the voice of authority. I did design as a journalistic afterthought, at nights or the weekend. I wrote about design being a force within the business culture. I had a small following.\nThat changed a few years back. The commoditization of manufacturing and knowledge and its outsourcing to Asia, left US companies unable to compete to make profits. When you can\u2019t compete on the basis of cost or quality, you have a problem. So the business community embraced the notion of innovation. Driving revenue and profits by turning out a continuous series of new things, be they products or services or even experiences.\nWowie. But how do people who\u2019ve spent a lifetime using their left-brain, suddenly shift to using both their left and their right? How do people used to deconstructing old problems into their parts and squeezing answers out of each of them then learn to see problems with fresh eyes and integrate parts of many solutions into one new one. Enter design and design thinking. Over the past decade, design has evolved to become an articulated, formalized method of solving problems that can be widely used in business\u00e2\u0080\u0094and in civil society. Design\u2019s focus on observing consumer/patient/student\u00e2\u0080\u0094human behavior, it\u2019s emphasis on iteration and speed, its ability to construct, not destruct, its search for new options and opportunities, its ability to connect to powerful emotions, its optimism, made converts out of tough CEOs. AG Lafely at P&G, Immelt at GE and many others embraced design. Now Mayor Daley of Chicago and Mayor Livingstone of London are embracing it.\nAnd so am I. I dropped the edit page and launched the Innovation & Design site online two years ago. It\u2019s a huge success. We open-source it and have many partners, including Core77, Dwell, ID magazine and Metropolis. We have the top thinkers and practitioners of design to write columns for us. I blog. We have built a global community around the ongoing conversation of design and innovation (20% of our traffic is from outside the US). And then we did something weird, we launched a new magazine off the website, because we found that many senior managers don\u2019t go online. Surprise. The new magazine is IN, Inside Innovation.\nToday, I kind of coach a team of about 8 people, 6 women in their early 30\u2019s, one guy in his thirties, and a women in her twenties (she\u2019s Canadian and a generation ahead of the 30-something sisters in technology). Our process is totally different from the hierarchical way of writing and editing we had just a few years ago. We all write for both platforms\u00e2\u0080\u0094online and print, and do a little TV on the side. Our job today as journalists is to curate conversations among groups within our audience, with Jessi Hempel doing social networking and philanthropy, Reena Jana doing fashion and gaming culture, Matt Vella doing cars and green technology, Aili McConon doing sustainability and motion technology such as wii. We design stories with our audience. As John Battelle said recently, the conversation now is the content. It\u2019s not about the finished story but about the ongoing story. It\u2019s the conversation. And since most conversations don\u2019t have a conclusion, they are ongoing. We live a life in beta.\nA final point on language: Innovation and Design. Business men and women don\u2019t like the term \u201cdesign.\u201d I think they think it implies drapes or dresses. Even top CEOs who embrace design don\u2019t want to call it that. They want to call it \u201cInnovation.\u201d That has a manly right to it. It\u2019s strong, techie. These folks are perfectly willing to use the word \u201cvision,\u201d whatever the heck \u201cvision\u201d is. They like \u201cImagination,\u201d whatever the heck that is. But they don\u2019t like \u201cdesign.\u201d Go figure.\nI solve this problem by calling it all a banana. Innovation, design, eco-imagination, just call it whatever they want to call it and do your design thing. Because your design thing is a glorious thing that has the potential of changing our lives in a myriad of ways in a myriad of places.\nTrackBack URL for this entry: http://blogs.businessweek.com/mt/mt-tb.cgi/\n"}], [{"score": 572.1302, "uuid": "8b80b3fd-73e8-5959-9d70-2b1e97b7ae68", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0306wb-58-11486", "target_hostname": "blogs.sunherald.com.au", "target_uri": "http://blogs.sunherald.com.au/whoweare/archives/2009/11/the_who_we_are_59.html?page=fullpage", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>The</em> Who We <em>Are</em> update: Week 46 | Who We <em>Are</em> | Sun Herald Blogs", "snippet": "<em>The</em> Andrew Olle Media Lecture by Julian Morrow was well worth watching &amp; really thought provoking.

It includes virulence studies in animal fetuses in utero, mouse convulsion bioassay of insulin, quantitation of tumor-initiator systems in mouse skin, calculation of potentiating effects of a hormonal factor in an isolated strip of contracting stomach muscle, etc.\nExamples of Biological Assay:\n- Limulus Test\n- Endpoint Determination\nLimulus Test is a sensitive method for detection of bacterial endotoxins and endotoxin-like substances that depends on the in vitro gelation of Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL), prepared from the circulating blood (amebocytes) of the horseshoe crab, by the endotoxin or related compound. Used for detection of endotoxin in body fluids and parenteral pharmaceuticals.\nEndpoint Determination is an establishment of the level of a quantifiable effect indicative of a biologic process. The evaluation is frequently to detect the degree of toxic or therapeutic effect.\nWhat Is Activated Sludge?\nActivated sludge is a biomass produced in raw or settled wastewater (primary effluent) by the growth of organisms in aeration tanks in the presence of dissolved oxygen. The term \"activated\" comes from the fact that the particles are teeming with bacteria, and protozoa. Activated sludge is different from primary sludge in that the sludge contains many living organisms which can feed on the incoming wastewater.\nThe activated sludge process is a wastewater treatment method in which the carbonaceous organic matter of wastewater provides an energy source for the production of new cells for a mixed population of microorganisms in an aquatic aerobic environment. The microbes convert carbon into cell tissue and oxidized end products that include carbon dioxide and water. In addition, a limited number of microorganisms may exist in activated sludge that obtain energy by oxidizing ammonia nitrogen to nitrate nitrogen in the process known as nitrification.\nBacteria constitute the majority of microorganisms present in activated sludge. Bacteria that require organic compounds for their supply of carbon and energy (heterotrophic bacteria) predominate, whereas bacteria that use inorganic compounds for cell growth (autotrophic bacteria) occur in proportion to concentrations of carbon and nitrogen. Both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria may exist in the activated sludge, but the preponderance of species are facultative, able to live in either the presence of or lack of dissolved oxygen.\nFungi, rotifers, and protozoans are also residents of activated sludge. The latter microorganisms are represented largely by ciliated species, but flagellated protozoans and amoebae may also be present. Protozoans serve as indicators of the activated sluge condition, and ciliated species are instrumental in removing Escherichia coli from sewage. Additionally, viruses of human origin may be found in raw sewage influent, but a large percentage appear to be removed by the activated-sludge process.\nThe success of the activated-sludge process is dependent upon establishing a mixed community of microorganisms that will remove and consume organic waste material, that will aggregate and adhere in a process known as bioflocculation, and that will settle in such a manner as to produce a concentrated sludge (return activated sludge, or RAS) for recycling. Any of several types of activated sludge solids separations problems indicate an imbalance in the biological component of this process. In the ideal \"healthy\" system, filamentous organisms grow within a floc (a large aggregate of adherent, or floc-forming, microorganisms, such as bacteria) and give it strength, with few filaments protruding out into the surrounding bulk solution. In such a system, there is no interference with the compaction and settling rates of the activated sludge prior to its recycling.\nThe activated-sludge process is a biological method of wastewater treatment that is performed by a variable and mixed community of microorganisms in an aerobic aquatic environment. These microorganisms derive energy from carbonaceous organic matter in aerated wastewater for the production of new cells in a process known as synthesis, while simultaneously releasing energy through the conversion of this organic matter into compounds that contain lower energy, such as carbon dioxide and water, in a process called respiration. As well, a variable number of microorganisms in the system obtain energy by converting ammonia nitrogen to nitrate nitrogen in a process termed nitrification. This consortium of microorganisms, the biological component of the process, is known collectively as activated sludge.\nThe overall goal of the activated-sludge process is to remove substances that have a demand for oxygen from the system. This is accomplished by the metabolic reactions (synthesis-respiration and nitrificaction) of the microorganisms, the separation and settling of activated-sludge solids to create an acceptable quality of secondary wastewater effluent, and the collection and recycling of microorganisms back into the system or removal of excess microorganisms from the system.\nAactivated-sludge process contains five essential interrelated equipment components.\nThe first is an aeration tank or tanks in which air or oxygen is introduced into the system to create an aerobic environment that meets the needs of the biological community and that keeps the activated sludge properly mixed. At least seven modifications in the shape and number of tanks exist to produce variations in the pattern of flow.\nSecond, an aeration source is required to ensure that adequate oxygen is fed into the tank(s) and that the appropriate mixing takes place. This source may be provided by pure oxygen, compressed air or mechanical aeration. Just as there are modifications in the shape and number of aeration tanks that can be used in the activated-sludge process, different equipment systems exist to deliver air or oxygen into aeration tanks.\nThird, in the activated-sludge process, aeration tanks are followed by secondary clarifiers. In secondary clarifiers, activated-sludge solids separate from the surrounding waterwater by the process of flocculation (the formation of large particle aggregates, or flocs, by the adherence of floc-forming organisms to filamentous organisms) and gravity sedimentation, in which flocs settle toward the bottom of the clarifier in a quiescent environment. This separation leads ideally to the formation of a secondary effluent (wastewater having a low level of activated-sludge solids in suspension) in the upper portion of the clarifier and a thickened sludge comprised of flocs, termed return activated sludge, or RAS, in the bottom portion of the clarifier.\nFourth, return activated sludge must be collected from the secondary clarifiers and pumped back to the aeration tank(s) before dissolved oxygen is depleted. In this way, the biological community needed to metabolize influent organic or inorganic matter in the wastewater stream is replenished.\nFifth, activated sludge containing an overabundance of microorganisms must be removed, or wasted (waste activated sludge, or WAS), from the system. This is accomplished with the use of pumps and is done in part to control the food-to-microorganism ratio in the aeration tank(s).\nThe biological component of the activated sludge system is comprised of microorganisms. The composition of these microorganisms is 70 to 90 percent organic matter and 10 to 30 percent organic matter. Cell makeup depends on both the chemical composition of the wastewater and the specific characteristics of the organisms in the biological community. (Water Environment Association, 1987)\nBacteria, fungi, protozoa, and rotifers constitute the biological component, or biological mass, of activated sludge. In addition, some metazoa, such as nematode worms, may be present. However, the constant agitation in the aeration tanks and sludge recirculation are deterrents to the growth of higher organisms.\nThe species of microorganism that dominates a system depends on environmental conditions, process design, the mode of plant operation, and the characteristics of the secondary influent wastewater. (Water Environment Association, 1987) The microorganisms that are of greatest numerical importance in activated sludge are bacteria, which occur as microscopic individuals from one micron in size to visible aggregations or colonies of individuals. Some bacteria are strict aerobes (they can only live in the presence of oxygen), whereas others are anaerobes (they are active only in the absence of oxygen). The preponderance of bacteria living in activated sludge are facultative\u0097able to live in either the presence or absence of oxygen, an important factor in the survival of activated sludge when dissolved oxygen concentrations are low or perhaps approaching depletion.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 353 - 6\nChange in metabolism of PHA accumulation by activated sludge modifying operating conditions; Serafim LS et al.; In the present work, sludge from a stable and efficient phosphorus removal process was used to evaluate the change in the metabolism when the reactor operation was modified from anaerobic/aerobic to aerobic dynamic substrate feeding . The change in operational conditions allowed the population to modify the metabolism of phosphorus and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) accumulation . Under aerobic dynamic feeding, phosphorus accumulation was almost hindered while the amount of PHA accumulation increased significantly . After ten days of operation under dynamic substrate feeding, the reactor operation turned back to anaerobic/aerobic cycles and the metabolism of phosphorus was progressively recovered.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 345 - 52\nRespirometric assessment of storage yield for different substrates; Karahan-Gul O et al.; A new procedure has been defined for the respirometric assessment of bacterial storage yield as defined in the Activated Sludge Model No.3 . The procedure was used to determine the storage yield, Y(STO), associated with acetate, glucose and domestic sewage, together with mixtures of acetate/glucose and acetate/domestic sewage at different initial F/M ratios . Y(STO) was calculated as 0.78 gCOD(gCOD)(-1) for acetate, 0.87 gCOD(gCOD)(-1) for glucose and 0.96 gCOD(gCOD)(-1) for domestic sewage . The Y(STO) of substrate mixtures was found to reflect the characteristics of the dominant fraction in the mixture.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 337 - 44\nPHA storage from several substrates by different morphological types in an anoxic/aerobic SBR; Dionisi D et al.; An activated sludge was cultivated on a mixture of several soluble substrates (acetate, ethanol, glucose, glutamic acid, peptone, Tween 80, starch, yeast extract) in an anoxic/aerobic SBR . Highly dynamic conditions in the SBR (feast famine regime) caused fast removal of most COD in the anoxic phase (in particular acetate, ethanol, glutamic acid and glucose were totally removed) and relevant contribution of storage . In spite of that, filament abundance was always high, as is typical of bulking sludges . Filaments which developed in the reactor were characterized on a morphological basis and on the basis of their ability to grow and to store polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) . Three main filaments prevailed in the biocenosis, whose relative abundance was varyng with time: Nostocoida limicola II, (two different morphological types), Haliscomenobacter hydrossis and an unidentified one . It was found that maximum growth rate was higher for flocformers than for filaments on each of the tested substrates . Epifluorescence showed that storage ability was more widespread among flocformers than in the filaments . Only one type of Nostocoida limicola II was able to store PHAs . The obtained data show that aerobic growth on the little residual fraction of COD from the anoxic phase was enough to support high abundance of filamentous microorganisms.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 327 - 32\nBenchmarking nitrogen removal suspended-carrier biofilm systems using dynamic simulation; Vanhooren H et al.; We are witnessing an enormous growth in biological nitrogen removal from wastewater . It presents specific challenges beyond traditional COD (carbon) removal . A possibility for optimised process design is the use of biomass-supporting media . In this paper, attached growth processes (AGP) are evaluated using dynamic simulations . The advantages of these systems that were qualitatively described elsewhere, are validated quantitatively based on a simulation benchmark for activated sludge treatment systems . This simulation benchmark is extended with a biofilm model that allows for fast and accurate simulation of the conversion of different substrates in a biofilm . The economic feasibility of this system is evaluated using the data generated with the benchmark simulations . Capital savings due to volume reduction and reduced sludge production are weighed out against increased aeration costs . In this evaluation, effluent quality is integrated as well.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 19 - 27\nMicrobial population dynamics in laboratory-scale activated sludge reactors; Kaewpipat K et al.; As a first step in understanding nonlinear dynamics in activated sludge systems, two laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors were operated under identical conditions and changes in their microbial communities were followed through microscopic examination, macroscopic observation, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene segments from the prokaryotic community . Two experiments were performed . The first used activated sludge from a local wastewater treatment plant to start the replicate reactors . The second used the biomass from the first experiment as a source by intermixing the two and equally redistributing the biomass into the two replicate reactors . For both experiments, the two reactors behaved fairly similarly and had similar microbial communities for a period of 60 days following start-up . Beyond that, the microbial communities in the two reactors in the first experiment diverged in composition, while those in the second experiment remained fairly similar . This suggests that the degree of change occurring in replicate reactors depends upon the severity of perturbation to which they are exposed . The DGGE data showed that the bacterial communities in both experiments were highly dynamic, even though the system performance of the replicate reactors were very similar, suggesting that dynamics within the prokaryotic community is not necessarily reflected in system performance . Moreover, a significant finding from this study is that replicate activated sludge systems are not identical, although they can be very similar if started appropriately.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 185 - 90\nImplementation of glycogen accumulating bacteria in treating nutrient-deficient wastewater; Jobbagy A et al.; Activated sludge treatment of nutrient-deficient wastes may lead to severe slime formation and consequent biomass separation difficulties . The purpose of this paper has been to show that bioreactor arrangement essentially influences the manner of biological excess carbon removal . In a comparative lab-scale experiment two differently arranged activated sludge systems were operated simultaneously: an aerated CSTR with an aerobic selector and an aerated CSTR with an anaerobic selector . The seed derived from an anaerobic/aerobic activated sludge plant of a winery . The model wastewater contained wine, sugar and acetic acid as organic carbon sources and lacked nutrients regarding both N and P, similarly to the influent of the full-scale plant . During the 52 days of the experiment the SVI values of the fully aerated system increased up to 600-800 cm3 g(-1) whereas those of the anaerobic/aerobic system remained below 250 cm3 g(-1) The SVI values showed a strict correlation with the amount of extracellular polysaccharides . In the anaerobic/aerobic experimental system, the high (40% of MLSS) intracellular polysaccharide content of the seed could be maintained . Besides the analytical data, also the microscopic observations of the biomass structure referred to the presence of glycogen accumulating organisms in both the lab- and full-scale anaerobic/aerobic systems.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 179 - 84\nPhylogenetic and physiological diversity of tetrad-forming organisms in deteriorated biological phosphorus removal systems; Tsai CS et al.; Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)- and polyphosphate-accumulating traits of different taxonomic tetrad-forming organisms (TFOs) in two anaerobic-aerobic sequential batch reactors (SBRs) were characterized by the simultaneous use of fluorescence in-situ hybridization, PHB stain and DAPI stain . The two SBRs with glucose as the main carbon source were operated under different P:total organic carbon feeding ratios for more than 300 days, but both exhibited no enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) activity . Microscopic observations on sludge samples taken at various times from those two SBRs revealed that TFOs consistently accounted for more than 50% of total cells, and were mostly affiliated with the beta- and gamma-subclasses of Proteobacteria and the high G+C phylum of gram-positive bacteria (HGC) . Those TFOs from the beta-Proteobcateria exhibited PHB stain positive and DAPI stain negative, indicating that they could utilize compounds other than polyphosphate (i.e . glycogen) as reducing power for PHA synthesis from glucose . In contrast, two types of TFOs within the HGC group showed negative PHB stain and positive DAPI stain, indicating their capacity to accumulate polyphosphate without the synthesis and degradation of PHA . This metabolic trait was different from the widely accepted biochemical model of EBPR and non-EBPR metabolisms . Other TFOs within the HGC group and gamma-Proteobacteria showed negative responses to both PHA and DAPI stains, and their function in the deteriorated EBPR system need to be further clarified . Overall findings suggested that the phylogenic and physiological heterogeneity of TFOs in anaerobic-aerobic activated sludge systems were diverse and greatly exceeded the current understanding.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 163 - 70\nPopulation dynamics in wastewater treatment plants with enhanced biological phosphorus removal operated with and without nitrogen removal; Lee N et al.; The population dynamics of activated sludge in a pilot plant with two activated sludge systems, both designed for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR), but one of them with (BNP) and the other without (BP) nitrogen removal, was monitored during a period of 2.5 years . The influent water to the pilot plant was periodically manipulated by external addition of phosphorus (P), acetate and glucose, respectively . The population dynamics and the in situ physiology were monitored by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and microautoradiography . Significant P removal was observed in both systems throughout the whole period, with significant increases of the P removal when substrates were dosed . The activated sludge in both systems contained large amounts of dense clusters of gram-negative, methylene-blue staining coccoid rods during the whole period . A large part of the clusters belonged to the beta Proteobacteria, whereas the rest of the clusters belonged either to the Actinobacteria or to the alpha Proteobacteria . The relative abundance of Rhodocyclus-related bacteria in the activated sludge varied significantly in both systems during the whole period (from 6 to 18% in BNP, and from 4 to 28% in BP) . However, no statistically significant correlation of the Rhodocyclus-related nor any of the other investigated bacterial groups to the P content of the activated sludge (correlation for all groups investigated was always < 0.5) was observed . A significant 33Pi uptake was observed by the beta Proteobacteria (part of them Rhodocyclus-related, the identity of the rest unknown) and the Actinobacteria . However, not all of the Rhodocyclus-related bacteria showed 33Pi uptake . The P removal in the investigated plants is thus believed to be mediated by a mixed population consisting of a part of the Rhodocyclus-related bacteria, the Actinobacteria and other, yet unidentified bacteria.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 155 - 62\nPolyphosphate kinase genes from activated sludge carrying out enhanced biological phosphorus removal; McMahon KD et al.; The community structure and metabolic function of activated sludge carrying out enhanced biological phosphorus removal have been investigated . Laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors were operated at several influent COD/P ratios to obtain sludges with a range of phosphorus contents . Molecular microbiological techniques based on small subunit ribosomal RNA were used to characterize the structure of these sludges . The dominant polyphosphate accumulating organism was a close relative of Rhodocyclus tenuis, a member of the beta subclass of the Proteobacteria . Fragments of genes coding for polyphosphate kinase (PPK), thought to be responsible for polyphosphate accumulation, were retrieved from one of the sludges . The relative abundance of PPK gene copies in genomic DNA extracted from sludges was determined to confirm that at least one of the PPK gene sequences was derived from the dominant polyphosphate accumulating organism.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 145 - 53\nAnalysis of microbial community that performs enhanced biological phosphorus removal in activated sludge fed with acetate; Onuki M et al.; Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) activated sludge was operated in a laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) fed with acetate as the sole carbon source . The microbial community of the sludge was analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method for about 2 months of start-up period . As a result, the number of major bands decreased during the enrichment, indicating that the microbial community structure was getting simpler . Since the phosphate removal activity was maintained at a high level, the bacteria which still remained at the end can be considered as the important bacteria playing key roles in the present EBPR sludge, maybe polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) . The dominant band in the last sample on the DGGE gel was excised and the DNA recovered from it was sequenced . The sequence was closely related to one of the putative PAOs group which Crocetti et al . (2000) and Hesselmann et al . (1999) have proposed . This PAOs group is closely related to the Rhodocyclus group (b-Proteobacteria) . The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method with the probe specific for this PAOs group and the DAPI staining at a phosphate-probing concentration indirectly showed that these Rhodocyclus related bacteria really accumulated polyphosphate.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 123 - 8\nPresence of Rhodocyclus in a full-scale wastewater treatment plant and their participation in enhanced biological phosphorus removal; Zilles JL et al.; The objective of this research was to assess the relevance of organisms related to Rhodocyclus in enhanced biological phosphorus removal in full-scale wastewater treatment plants . The presence of these organisms in full-scale plants was first confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization . To address which organisms were involved in phosphorus removal, a method was developed which selected polyphosphate-accumulating organisms from activated sludge samples by DAPI staining and flow cytometry . Sorted samples were characterized using fluorescent in situ hybridization . The results of these analyses confirmed the presence of organisms related to Rhodocyclus in full-scale wastewater treatment plants and supported the involvement of these organisms in enhanced biological phosphorus removal . However, a significant fraction of the polyphosphate-accumulating organisms were not related to Rhodocyclus.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 111 - 4\nCharacterization of type 1851 organism isolated from activated sludge samples; Kohno T et al.; Five orange pigmented filamentous strains of Eikelboom's type 1851 were isolated from bulking activated sludge, and were examined for their phylogenetic lineage, morphology, and physiology . The analysis of 16S rDNA sequence revealed that the isolates belong to Chloroflexus subdivision in green non sulfur bacteria . They shared most common features with type 1851, but the result of gram stain was negative . Furthermore, they showed polymorphic nature and gliding motility, which could not be seen in activated sludge samples . General physiological tests were conducted under aerobic conditions although they could also grow by fermentation . Good growth was generally seen on sugars . The extremely slow growth rate (0.48-0.93 day(-1)) suggests the stimulation of this type exclusively in long SRT systems fed with sugars.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 11 - 8\nEvaluating the role of microbial stress response mechanisms in causing biological treatment system upset; Love NG et al.; It is known that microbial stress mechanisms play a significant role in short-term microbial adaptation to environmental perturbations, and activation of these mechanisms enhance a cell's chance for surviving the perturbation with minimal damage . Although the target of these mechanisms is protective at the cellular level, the effect may be disruptive at the macroscopic level in engineered bioreactor systems . In this paper, it is proposed that these mechanisms are activated in response to wastewater influent perturbations and may be a significant cause of activated sludge treatment process upset . Selected microbial stress responses are reviewed and hypotheses indicating their potential role in treatment process upset are proposed . A research approach that was previously used to identify the mechanistic cause of deflocculation during perturbation by electrophilic chemicals is summarized, and a protocol for future experiments geared toward establishing source-cause-effect relationships for a range of wastewater upset conditions is put forth . Identifying source-cause-effect relationships will provide a basis for development of new monitoring technologies and operational strategies for systems under the influence of influent chemical perturbations.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 105 - 10\nThe \"Nostocoida limicola\" story: resolving the phylogeny of this morphotype responsible for bulking in activated sludge; Seviour RJ et al.; On the basis of 16S rRNA sequence analyses of several isolates of \"Nostocoida limicola\" from activated sludge plants in Australia and other countries, it is clear that \"N . limicola\" I, II and III are not three morphological variants of a single bacterium but at least three phylogenetically different bacteria . Data show that \"N . limicola\" I are members of at least two genera in the low mol% G+C gram-positive bacteria, while some isolates of \"N . limicola\" II belong to the high mol% G+C gram positive bacteria, and \"N . limicola\" III is a member of the Planctomycetales . Design and application of 16S rRNA targeted probes for each to biomass samples suggests that their phylogeny is more diverse than pure culture studies would suggest.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 46(1-2), 1 - 9\nWho eats what? Classifying microbial populations based on diurnal profiles of rRNA levels; Frigon D et al.; Identifying the relationships between various bacterial populations and the substrates they consume is central to the understanding of population dynamics and to the development of process control in activated sludge . However, linking a heterotrophic population to its activity in situ is difficult because ribosomal RNA (rRNA) techniques, while allowing the rapid identification of populations, provide little information about their heterotrophic activity . Activated sludge models describe biodegradation kinetics by classifying substrates into two types: readily and slowly degradable substrates . Assuming that bacterial populations specialize in degrading one type of substrate, their growth rate should be affected differently if the COD loading rate varies diurnally as for a municipal activated sludge system . Modeling results suggested that the growth rates of populations consuming readily degradable substrates vary according to variations in COD loading rate . On the other hand, the growth rates of populations consuming slowly degradable substrates do not change despite the variation in COD loading rate . Since the cellular rRNA level is positively correlated with the growth rate, we hypothesized that the rRNA levels of some populations in municipal activated sludge should increase throughout the day, while they should stay constant for other populations . This hypothesis was verified by monitoring the rRNA level of Acinetobacter (a model population consuming readily degradable substrates) and Gordonia (a model population consuming slowly degradable substrates) in the mixed liquor of a full-scale municipal activated sludge reactor for three weeks.\nEnviron Sci Pollut Res Int, 2002, 9(4), 227 - 9\nIncreasing the microbial activity in activated sludge by the phenomenon of 'biological resonance; Schmid A; Mechanical oscillations as well as electrical oscillations (e.g . in an electrical oscillatory circuit) can lead to resonance conditions by external agitation with the natural frequency of the system . During the microbial protein synthesis, the induction and repression mechanisms also cause oscillations in the form of varying protein concentrations . The aim of this work concentrates on an induced resonance case of the biological system, comparable with physical resonance phenomena, by external periodic stimulations . For this, system theoretical computer simulations with a structured genetic model were carried out, which built the theoretical fundament for describing the effect of 'Biological Resonance' . Based on that, lab-scale experiments using a mixed microbial culture (activated sludge) and skimmed milk as an inducing substrate revealed an enhanced microbial productivity of around 60%-75% compared to values of the productivity under steady-state conditions in a narrow range of process parameters . The optimum (resonance case) was confirmed by a repetition of the variation experiments and is characterised by a substrate supply period of approx . 18 min and a following starvation period of about 9 min . Long-term investigations under optimised process conditions indicate adaptation mechanisms of the microorganisms to evade the imposed stress conditions . The productivity will not remain constant without additional stimulation and declines to its original level . However, temporal modulation of the starvation period permanently increases the productivity (elevated catabolism) to about 60%, which was observed over a period of several weeks.\nEnviron Technol, 2002 Aug, 23(8), 931 - 6\nCharacteristics of aerobic granules grown on glucose and acetate in sequential aerobic sludge blanket reactors; Tay JH et al.; Aerobic granules were cultivated in two column-type sequential aerobic sludge blanket reactors fed with glucose and acetate, respectively . The characteristics of aerobic granules were investigated . Results indicated that the glucose- and acetate-fed granules have comparable characteristics in terms of settling velocity, size, shape, biomass density, hydrophobicity, physical strength, microbial activity and storage stability . Substrate component does not seem to be a key factor on the formation of aerobic granules . However, microbial diversity of the granules is closely associated with the carbon sources supplied to the reactors . Compared with the conventional activated sludge flocs, aerobic granules exhibit excellent physical characteristics that would be essential for industrial application . This research provides a complete set of characteristics data of aerobic granules grown on glucose and acetate, which would be useful for further development of aerobic granules-based compact bioreactor for handling high strength organic wastewater.\nEnviron Technol, 2002 Aug, 23(8), 937 - 48\nASExpert: an integrated knowledge-based system for activated sludge plants; Sorour MT et al.; The activated sludge process is commonly used for secondary wastewater treatment worldwide . This process is capable of achieving high quality effluent . However it has the reputation of being difficult to operate because of its poorly understood biological behaviour, variability of input flows and the need to incorporate qualitative data . To augment this incomplete knowledge with experience, knowledge-based systems were introduced in the 1980s however they didn't receive much popularity . This paper presents the Activated Sludge Expert system (ASExpert), which is a rule-based expert system plus a complete database tool proposed for use in activated sludge plants . The paper focuses on presenting the system's main features and capabilities to revive the interest in knowledge-based systems as a reliable means for monitoring plants . Then it presents the methodology adopted for ASExpert validation along with an assessment of testing results . Finally it concludes that expert systems technology has proved its importance for enhancing performance, especially if in the future it is integrated to a modern control system.\nEnviron Technol, 2002 Aug, 23(8), 849 - 62\nCalibration and validation of activated sludge model No.2d for Spanish municipal wastewater; Penya-Roja JM et al.; Activated Sludge Model No . 2d (ASM2d) was validated with data obtained from pilot scale plant treating municipal wastewater from the city of Valencia (Spain) . First of all, ASM2d was calibrated using experimental data from anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic batches . A set of kinetic and stoichiometric parameters resulted from these assays . Differences between the values obtained and default values proposed in ASM2d can be explained by the presence of glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) . The calibrated model was then used to simulate results from a pilot plant . Simulation using the set of parameters obtained accurately reproduces experimental results . This paper also presents a detailed procedure to estimate kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for heterotrophic, autotrophic and polyphosphate accumulating bacteria.\nBiotechnol Bioeng, 2002 Sep 30, 79(7), 754 - 67\nModeling aerobic carbon source degradation processes using titrimetric data and combined respirometric-titrimetric data: structural and practical identifiability; Gernaey K et al.; The structural and practical identifiability of a model for description of respirometric-titrimetric data derived from aerobic batch substrate degradation experiments of a C(x)H(y)O(z) carbon source with activated sludge was evaluated . The model processes needed to describe titrimetric data included substrate uptake, CO(2) production, and NH(3) uptake for biomass growth . The structural identifiability was studied using the Taylor series method and a recently proposed generalization method . It showed that combining respirometric and titrimetric data allows structural identifiability of one extra parameter combination, the biomass yield, Y(H), compared to estimation on separate data sets, on condition that the nitrogen fraction in biomass (i(XB)) is known . However, data from short-term batch substrate degradation experiments were not sufficiently informative to allow practical identification of all structurally identifiable parameters . Combining respirometry and titrimetry resulted in improvements of parameter confidence intervals compared to estimation on separate respirometric or titrimetric data sets . However, the level of the improvement seems to be substrate dependent: parameter confidence intervals improved considerably more for dextrose than for acetate degradation models . Noteworthy is the finding that the half-saturation substrate concentrations can be different depending on whether they are estimated from respirometric or titrimetric data . Moreover, this difference appears to be dependent on the carbon source considered: for dextrose, titrimetry-based K(S) values are higher than respirometry-based values while for acetate the opposite was found . It was hypothesized that this can be explained by the different point in cell metabolism where the proton production or consumption takes place, leading to a corresponding difference in timing between pH effect and oxygen consumption . Finally, the biomass yield Y(H) and the nitrogen content of the biomass i(XB) could be estimated from combined respirometric-titrimetric data obtained with addition of a known amount of carbon source . Y(H) can also be estimated from r(O) data when the initial substrate concentration S(S)(0) is known . The values found correspond to values reported in literature, but, interestingly, also seem able to reflect the occurrence of storage processes when pulses of acetate and dextrose are added .\nBiotechnol Bioeng, 2002 Sep 30, 79(7), 741 - 53\nModeling aerobic carbon source degradation processes using titrimetric data and combined respirometric-titrimetric data: experimental data and model structure; Gernaey K et al.; Experimental data are presented that resulted from aerobic batch degradation experiments in activated sludge with simple carbon sources (acetate and dextrose) as substrates . Data collection was done using combined respirometric-titrimetric measurements . The respirometer consists of an open aerated vessel and a closed non-aerated respiration chamber for monitoring the oxygen uptake rate related to substrate degradation . The respirometer is combined with a titrimetric unit that keeps the pH of the activated sludge sample at a constant value by addition of acid and/or base . The experimental data clearly showed that the activated sludge bacteria react with consumption or production of protons during aerobic degradation of the two carbon sources under study . Thus, the cumulative amount of added acid and/or base could serve as a complementary information source on the degradation processes . For acetate, protons were consumed during aerobic degradation, whereas for dextrose protons were produced . For both carbon sources, a linear relationship was found between the amount of carbon source added and the amount of protons consumed (in case of acetate: 0.38 meq/mmol) or produced (in case of dextrose: 1.33 meq/mmol) during substrate degradation . A model taking into account substrate uptake, CO(2) production, and NH(3) uptake for biomass growth is proposed to describe the aerobic degradation of a C(x)H(y)O(z)-type carbon source . Theoretical evaluation of this model for reference parameters showed that the proton effect due to aerobic substrate degradation is a function of the pH of the liquid phase . The proposed model could describe the experimental observations with both carbon sources .\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 45(12), 71 - 8\nDevelopment of a biological process for livestock wastewater treatment using a technique for predominant outgrowth of Bacillus species; Choi YS et al.; The investigation has been carried out by treating 1 m3/day of livestock wastewater for 9 months . The biological process is composed of two reactors connected in series . Each reactor has been designed to stimulate the growth of Bacillus sp., spore-forming aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria . As a consequence, the population of Bacillus sp . is aptly increased via the cycle of sporulation, germination and proliferation . With a predominant growth of Bacillus sp., the microbial activity has been increased comparing to activated sludge based on the result of measuring specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) . This process was able to remove nitrogen and phosphorus as well as organic matter efficiently . More than 98% of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were removed . In term of removing the total nitrogen (T-N), about 98% of this was reduced . On average, the T-N concentration in the feed was 3,270 mg/l but 74 mg/l in the effluent including 30 mg/l of nitrite and nitrate nitrogen . The total phosphorus (T-P) reduction averaged 87.5% . As a result, it would be advantageous to load this process in order to deal with high-strength wastewater.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 45(12), 339 - 46\nBiological treatability of a corn wet mill effluent; Eremektar G et al.; Corn wet mill effluents are studied in terms of their characteristics relevant for biological treatment . They have a high COD of mainly soluble and biodegradable nature, with practically no soluble inert components . They generate a relatively high level of soluble residual metabolic products, which affects the choice of the appropriate biological treatment and favors aerobic activated sludge process . Experimental assessment of process kinetics yields typical values . Hydrolysis of the slowly biodegradable COD, the rate limiting step for the utilization of substrate, is characterized by an overall rate coefficient, which is within the range commonly associated for the hydrolysis of starch.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 45(12), 321 - 8\nDairy wastewater treatment in a moving bed biofilm reactor; Andreottola G et al.; Dairy raw wastewater is characterised by high concentrations and fluctuations of organic matter and nutrient loads related to the discontinuity in the cheese production cycle and machinery washing . The applicability of a Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) filled with FLOCOR-RMP plastic media to the treatment of dairy wastewater was evaluated in a pilot-plant . COD fractionation of influent wastewater, MBBR performance on COD and nutrient removal were investigated . A removal efficiency of total COD over 80% was obtained with an applied load up to 52.7 gCOD m-2 d-1 (corresponding to 5 kgCOD m-3d-1) . The COD removal kinetics for the MBBR system was assessed . The order of the kinetics resulted very close to half-order in the case of a biofilm partially penetrated by the substrate . The nitrogen removal efficiency varied widely between 13.3 and 96.2% due to the bacterial synthesis requirement . The application of a MBBR system to dairy wastewater treatment may be appropriate when upgrading overloaded activated sludge plants or in order to minimise reactor volumes in a pre-treatment.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 45(12), 305 - 13\nOzonation application in activated sludge systems for a textile mill effluent; Orhon D et al.; The study investigates the effect of partial ozonation of textile wastewater, both at the inlet (pre-ozonation) and the outlet (post-ozonation) of biological treatment, for the optimization of COD and color removals, both typical polluting parameters associated with the textile industry . Pre-ozonation provides at optimum contact time of 15 minutes 85% color removal, but only 19% COD reduction . Removal of the soluble inert COD fraction remains at 7%, indicating selective preference of ozone for simpler compounds . Post-ozonation is much more effective on the breakdown of refractory organic compounds and on color removal efficiency . Ozonation after biological treatment results in almost complete color removal and a 14% soluble inert COD reduction . The polishing effect of post-ozonation also proves quite attractive from an economical standpoint, involving approximately 50% of the ozone utilization at the same ozone flux rate and contact time, yet providing a lower soluble residual COD level.\nWater Sci Technol, 2002, 45(12), 23 - 36\nImportant limitations in the modeling of activated sludge: biased calibration of the hydrolysis process; Insel G et al.; The merit of activated sludge models depends on the accuracy and reliability of the information they contain on the wastewater to be treated and the biochemical mechanisms involved . In most advanced calibration studies, respirometry i.e . the measurement of the oxygen utilization rate, (OUR), provides the majority of the required experimental database . However, currently used procedures still involve a number of basic and practical problems . Model evaluation of the OUR data may generate a distorted image of the processes involved . Hydrolysis is the most important, yet the most vulnerable process as far as the experimental assessment of accurate kinetic parameters is concerned . This study intends to provide an overview of major experimental limitations in the modeling of activated sludge, with emphasis on the appropriate experimental design for the assessment of the hydrolysis rate.\nWhile both heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria reside in activated sludge, the former predominate. Heterotrophic bacteria obtain energy from carbonaceous organic matter in influent wastewater for the synthesis of new cells. At the same time, they release energy via the conversion of organic matter into compounds such as carbon dioxide and water. Important genera of heterotrophic bacteria include Achromobacter, Alcaligenes, Arthrobacter, Citromonas, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Zoogloea.\nAutotrophic bacteria in activated sludge reduce oxidized carbon compounds such as carbon dioxide for cell growth. These bacteria obtain their energy by oxidizing ammonia nitrogen to nitrate nitrogen in a two-stage conversion process known as nitrification. Due to the fact that very little energy is derived from these oxidization reactions, and because energy is required to convert carbon dioxide to cellular carbon, nitrifying bacteria represent a small percentage of the total population of microorganisms in activated sludge. In addition, autotrophic nitrifying bacteria have a slower rate of reproduction than heterotrophic, carbon-removing bacteria. Two genera of bacteria are responsible for the conversion of ammonia to nitrate in activated sludge, Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas.\nNitrification generally occurs when the time that the sludge stays in the system (called the mean cell residence time, or MCRT) is increased. A longer mean cell residence time, therefore, allows an adequate population of nitrifying bacteria to be built up. However, because the oxygen demand for complete nitrification is high, both the necessary oxygen supply and power requirements for the system will be increased. Moreover, optimum pH for the growth of nitrifying bacteria is in the 8 to 9 range, with pH levels below 7 causing a substantial reduction in nitrification activity. In the process of converting ammonia to nitrate, mineral acidity is produced. In instances when insufficient alkalinity exists, the pH in the system will drop, potentially inhibiting nitrification. Finally, though nitrification occurs over a wide range of temperatures, a reduction in temperature produces a slower rate of reaction. (Water Environment Society, 1987)\nSome activated sludge systems have been designed specifically to promote the higher growth rate of bacteria that remove carbon from influent wastewater, and adding chemicals may suppress nitrification. Other systems are operated to achieve nitrification in the second stage of a two-stage activated-sludge system due to the longer mean cell residence time (MCRT) necessary for nitrification. Still other systems are designed to promote nitrification. (Water Environment Society, 1987)\nFungi are also a constituent of activated sludge. These multicellular organisms metabolize organic compounds and can successfully compete with bacteria under certain environmental conditions in a mixed culture. (Water Environment Society, 1987) In addition, a small number of fungi are capable of oxidizing ammonia to nitrite, and fewer still to nitrate. (Painter, 1970) The most common sewage fungus organisms are Sphaerotilus natans and Zoogloea sp. (Curtis, 1969)\nA number of species of protozoa have been identified in activated sludge. Protozoa are single-celled organisms that can consume food such as bacteria and particulate matter. Ciliated protozoa are numerically the most common species in activated sludge, but flagellated protozoa and amoebae may also be present. The species of ciliated protozoa most commonly observed in wastewater treatment processes include Aspidisca costata, Carchesium polypinum, Chilodonella uncinata, Opercularia coarcta and O. microdiscum, Trachelophyllum pusillum, Vorticella convallaria and V. microstoma\nProtozoa are a useful biological indicator of the condition of the activated sludge. Being strict aerobes, these microorganisms prove to be excellent indicators of an aerobic environment (though some protozoa are capable of surviving up to 12 hours in the absence of oxygen). Protozoa also act as indicators of a toxic environment, as they exhibit a greater sensitivity to toxicity than bacteria. A clue that toxicity may be a problem in a system is the absence of or a lack of mobility of these organisms in activated sludge. The hallmark of a well-operated, stable activated-sludge system is the existence of large numbers of highly evolved protozoa in the biological mass.\nRotifers are multicellular aquatic microorganisms that look like rapidly revolving wheels when they are in motion. This is due to the fact that the anterior end of the animal is modified into a retractible disc, or corona, bearing circles of strong cilia. Rotifers are able to consume both microbes and particulate matter. Like protozoa, these microorganisms are strict aerobes and are more sensitive to toxic conditions than bacteria. Rotifers are found only in a very stable activated-sludge environment.\nFinally, viruses are also found in wastewater, particularly human viruses that are excreted in large quantities in feces. These human enteric viruses can be divided into six major subgroups: adenovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus, infectious hepatitus, poliovirus, and reovirus. Viruses native to animals and plants exist in lesser quantities in wastewater, and bacterial viruses may also be present. (Grabow, 1968) While Grabow (1968) notes that there is a quantitative reduction of these viruses by the activated-sludge treatment process, the author states that the mechanism by which they are removed or deactivated remains to be clearly explained. Different mechanisms indicated by the work of various researchers included inactivation of viruses by biological antagonists in the sludge, adsorption, and reduction in which suspended solids, colloidal material, aeration, and perhaps toxic substances play a role.\nBefore ending my discussion of the biological component of the activated-sludge process and discussing solids separation, factors affecting the efficiency of the process in removing carbonaceous organic material and achieving nitrification should be mentioned. These factors have been summarized in Activated Sludge, Manual of Practice #9 (Water Environment Society, 1987) and include: how readily organic material and ammonia can be metabolized by the microorganisms; the mean cell retention time (MCRT) and food-to-microorganism ratio; how readily organic material can be oxidized and used for cell synthesis; the number and types of active microorganisms present in the aeration tank(s); environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen concentration, nutrients, pH, temperature, and presence of toxic materials; adequacy of the original design for mixing, RAS (return activated sludge) and WAS (waste activated sludge) pumping, and aeration capacity; proper maintenance of plant equipment; and adequate training of plant staff.\nAchromobacter, Alcaligenes, Arthrobacter, Citromonas, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Zoogloea, appear to be the primary floc-forming microorganisms.\nImmobilization materials mixed with activated sludge as column biofilters for the treatment of gaseous stream containing benzene and toluene. Syu, MJ; Wang, YW. Bioprocess Engineering, 21(3): 239-244. 1999\nABSTRACT Activated sludge has been utilized for the treatment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are emitted from industrial processes. Nevertheless, activated sludge systems often suffer from the problem caused by concentration gradients as well as pressure drops. Channeling is also a major problem in the treatment process. As the bed height of the packed activated sludge system increases, the pressure drop increases accordingly. To solve these problems, we proposed immobilized activated sludge column reactors for treating VOCs in air. The immobilization material used to mix with activated sludge was properly selected in this work. Elemental compositions of these materials were analyzed. In this study, we also proposed a VOC feed system so that more stable inlet concentrations could be achieved. Hence, the equipment and operating costs were reduced and the problem of VOCs leaking from peristaltic pumps was avoided. The moisture content of the system was well maintained and better VOC removal efficiency was achieved. With an operation condition of progressive VOC inlet concentrations, better removal efficiency of benzene and toluene was then obtained. In conclusion, by the utilization of immobilization materials selected from wastes as well as immobilized activated sludge column reactors, significant removal efficiency for both benzene and toluene was demonstrated.\nTreating VOC-contaminated gases in activated sludge: Mechanistic model to evaluate design and performance. Bielefeldt, AR; Stensel, HD. Environmental Science & Technology, 33(18): 3234-3240. 1999\nABSTRACT A mechanistic model based on independently measurable mass transfer and biokinetic parameters was developed to describe the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contained in air sparged into activated sludge (suspended growth) gas treatment reactor. The critical mass transfer parameters are the VOC mass transfer coefficient (Kla(voc)), VOC Henry's coefficient (H) and diffusion coefficient in water, gas flow rate per unit reactor area, and liquid depth. The Kla(voc) is equal to the oxygen Kla (Kla(O2)) multiplied by the ratio of the VDC to oxygen diffusivity coefficients in water raised to the power n. Depending on the system power intensity, n ranges from 0.5 to 1.0; 1.0 provides a conservative design. Biokinetic parameters of importance include the Monod coefficients, biomass yield and endogenous decay coefficients, and solids retention time (SRT). The model accurately predicted BTEX removal from air diffused into a 2-L, 40-cm deep lab-scale reactor. Based on the model, a 2-m deep gas treatment reactor should provide >80% gas treatment efficiency for VOCs with H < 0.35, when the reactor is operated at an SRT which maintains the VOC liquid concentration below 0.1 mg/L, with a Kla(O2) of 40 h(-1) at an air application rate of 55 m(3)/m(2)-h.\nBiological deodorization using activated carbon fabric as a carrier of microorganism. Lee-S-K; Shoda-M. J.Ferment.Bioeng.; 68(6): 437-444. 1989\nABSTRACT: The biological deodorization of methyl mercaptan (MM) was studied using an activated C fabric as a support of microorganisms. Seeding the C fabric was done by submerging or spraying with digested sludge obtained from a night soil treatment plant. 2 l/kg dry C fabric of digested sludge was seeded. The weight of packed C fabric was 40 g and the packing volume was 240 ml in each column. The MM concentration decreased with time and was undetectable 1 wk later, and the concentration of DMDS (dimethyl disulfide)increased to a maximum of 1.3 ppm in 1 wk. After 12 days neither DMDS or MM was detected due to the acclimation of microorganisms indigenous to the sludge to both gases. The C fabric was compared with sponge, polyester cloth and carbonized coal as carriers. At an inlet concentration of 20 ppm MM, MM and DMDS were not detected with the C fabric. MM was not detected in the other columns, although DMDS was detected in the effluent for 10 days. The critical load of MM was determined as 0.48 g S/kg C fabric/day. Vmax was 0.69 g S/kg C fabric/day and Ks was 7.7 ppm. About 80% of MM removed in the biofilter was converted into the sulfate ion. (13 ref)\nActivated Sludge\nActivated Sludge is a widely used aerobic method of sewage treatment. After primary settling, the waste stream is brought to an aeration tank. Air is put in and/or there is mechanical stirring which provides aeration of the waste. Sludge from a previous run is usually reintroduced to the tanks to provide microorganisms. This is why it is called activated sludge. During the period in the aeration tank, large developments of heterotrophic organisms occur. In the activated sludge tank the bacteria occur in free suspension and as aggregates or flocs. Extensive microbial metabolism of organic compunds in the sewage results in the production of new microbial biomass. Most of this biomass becomes associated with flocs that can be removed from suspension by settling. A portion of the settled sewage sludge is recycled and the remainder must be treated by composting or anaerobic digestion. Combined with primary settling, activated sludge reduces the BOD by 85% to 90%. It also drastically reduces the number of intestinal pathogens. An illustration of an aeration basin is shown below.\nThe water used by each household is transported through a collective underground sewer system that ends at the municipal wastewater treatment plant. When the wastewater first arrives at the treatment plant it undergoes screening to remove the large solids and grit that may be present. The screened water then undergoes primary treatment that involves the settling of suspended solids. The solids are collected as primary sludge, while the primary wastewater then goes onto secondary treatment. In secondary treatment, \"activated sludge\" microbes consume the dissolved and suspended organics in the wastewater and grow, and then solids are again removed by flocculation and collected. The final 'sludge' is a combination of the primary sludge and the secondary sludge.\nBiological Nutrient Removal (Activated Sludge Process)\nThe heart of the treatment process takes place in this step. This is the biological step in the treatment process occurs, using naturally occurring microbes to decompose the organic material in the wastewater. Primary effluent first enters two baffled zones mixed by submerged propellers. The removal of nitrogen (denitrification) occurs here because the microbes utilize nitrates as a source of oxygen and the nitrogen gas is released into the atmosphere. Methanol is added as necessary to provide a supplemental carbon source to promote denitrification.\nAlthough the organisms that conduct this portion of the treatment are the same organisms that can be found in nature in ponds, lakes and streams, they exist in much higher concentration in the controlled atmosphere of a reclamation plant. To allow these organisms to live in such high concentration, air must be pumped into the oxic zone of these tanks, hence the name \"aeration\" basin. Ambient oxygen-the same air we breathe-is pumped into the bottom of the 30-foot deep tanks using a fine bubbler aeration system to evenly diffuse the oxygen across the bottom surface of the tanks. Nitrification takes place in this portion of the tank, when nitrogen in the form of ammonia is converted to nitrate. Water remains in the aeration basins approximately five hours.\nAS Stasinakis, Aerobic biodegradation of organotin compounds in activated sludge batch reactors. Environ Pollut, April 1, 2005; 134(3): 431-8,\nThe biodegradation behavior of four organotin (OT) compounds, namely tributyltin (TBT), dibutyltin (DBT), monobutyltin (MBT) and triphenyltin (TPhT), was studied in lab-scale activated sludge batch reactors. The activated sludge was spiked with the OT compounds at a level of 100mugl(-1) as Sn. Determination of the OT compounds by GC-FPD after ethylation in the dissolved and particulate phase revealed that 24h after the start of the experiments, almost the total of OT compounds has been removed from the dissolved phase and is associated with the suspended solids. Calculation of mass balance in batch reactors showed that OT compounds biodegradation was performed via a sequential dealkylation process. Removals due to biodegradation were differentiated according to the parent compound. In experiments with non-acclimatized biomass, a percentage of 27.1, 8.3, 73.8 and 51.3 was still present as TBT, DBT, MBT and TPhT, respectively, at the end of the experiment (18th day). Half-lives (t(1/2)) of 10.2 and 5.1 days were calculated for TBT and DBT, respectively, whereas apparent t(1/2) values could not be determined for MBT and TPhT (t(1/2)>18 days). The capacity of activated sludge to biodegrade OT compounds in the absence of supplemental substrate indicated that these compounds can be metabolized as single sources of carbon and energy in activated sludge systems. Excluding TBT, the presence of low concentrations of supplemental substrate did not affect the biodegradation potential of activated sludge. The acclimatization of biomass on OT compounds enhanced significantly biodegradation, resulting in significant decreases of half-lives of OT compounds. As a result in the presence of acclimatized biomass, half-lives of 1.4, 3.6, 9.8 and 5.0 days were calculated for TBT, DBT, MBT and TPhT, respectively.\nA Katsoyiannis, Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the conventional activated sludge treatment process: fate and mass balance. Environ Res, March 1, 2005; 97(3): 245-57,\nThe fate and the mass balance of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) during the conventional activated sludge treatment process were investigated in the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Thessaloniki, northern Greece. The POPs of interest were 7 polychlorinated biphenyls and 19 organochlorine pesticides. Target compounds were determined at six different points across the treatment system: the influent, the effluent of the primary sedimentation tank, the effluent of the secondary sedimentation tank, the primary sludge, the activated sludge from the recirculation stream, and the digested/dewatered sludge. The distribution of POPs between the dissolved and the adsorbed phases of wastewater and sludge was investigated. A good linear relationship between the distribution coefficients, K(d), and the octanol-water partition coefficients, K(ow), of the solutes was observed only in raw wastewater, suggesting that other factors affect the phase distribution of organic compounds in treated wastewater. For all POPs, a significant increase in partitioning with a decreasing solids concentration was observed, revealing an effect from non-settling microparticles remaining in the \"dissolved\" phase during the separation procedure. A good linear relationship was also revealed between logK(d) and the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content of wastewater, suggesting that DOC favors the advective transport of POPs in the dissolved phase. Almost all POPs showed good mass balance agreements at both the primary and the secondary treatment. The losses observed for some species could be attributed to biodegradation/biotransformation rather than volatilization. The relative distribution between the treated effluent and the waste sludge streams varied largely among different compounds, with p-p'-DDE being highly accumulated in the waste sludge (98%) but almost 60% of alpha-HCH remaining in the treated effluent.\nA Nicolau, Effect of copper in the protistan community of activated sludge. Chemosphere, February 1, 2005; 58(5): 605-14,\nProtists have proved to be an interesting tool for assessing the occurrence of pollution in wastewater treatment systems along with its role in the control of pollution itself through grazing of dispersed bacteria and maintenance of a healthy trophic web in those artificial ecosystems. Two sets of assays were carried on in a bench scale pilot plant in order to study the response of the activated sludge community of protists to the exposure of copper: the first set was carried on with synthetic sewage and the second one with real sewage. The results emphasize the ability of activated sludge biological communities to survive and to react to toxicants and highlight the role of protistan communities as indicators of toxicants entrance in treatment systems.\nDF Juang, Effects of synthetic polymer on the filamentous bacteria in activated sludge. Bioresour Technol, January 1, 2005; 96(1): 31-40,\nFilamentous bulking is one of the solid-liquid separation problems always seen in activated sludge process. The addition of synthetic polymer is always one of the popular ways for the treatment plant operator to immediately solve the poor sludge settling problem. Therefore, it may be interesting to understand the effects of synthetic polymer on the filamentous bacteria in activated sludge. In this study, synthetic polymer was applied to a lab-scale wastewater treatment system with the filamentous bulking problem. The population structure of filamentous bacteria and sludge characteristics were investigated under different conditions. When synthetic polymer was added into the system, it was found that poor sludge settleability caused by filamentous bulking was temporarily solved and filamentous branches growing outside the flocs were damaged or inhibited. However, filamentous growth was still observed inside the flocs. After the addition of polymer was halted, filamentous branches extended out of the flocs immediately. Very serious filamentous bulking occurred and sludge settleability became much worse than that occurring before the addition of polymer. And, it took several weeks for the system to return to normal operation.\nJC Vogelaar, Bioflocculation of mesophilic and thermophilic activated sludge. Water Res, January 1, 2005; 39(1): 37-46,\nThermophilic activated sludge treatment is often hampered by a turbid effluent. Reasons for this phenomenon are so far unknown. Here, the hypothesis of the temperature dependency of the hydrophobic interaction as a possible cause for diminished thermophilic activated sludge bioflocculation was tested. Adsorption of wastewater colloidal particles was monitored on different flat surfaces as a function of temperature. Adsorption on a hydrophobic surface varied with temperature between 20 and 60 degrees C and no upward or downward trend could be observed. This makes the hydrophobic interaction hypothesis unlikely in explaining the differences in mesophilic and thermophilic activated sludge bioflocculation. Both mesophilic and thermophilic biomass did not flocculate with wastewater colloidal particles under anaerobic conditions. Only in the presence of oxygen, with biologically active bacteria, the differences in bioflocculation behavior became evident. Bioflocculation was shown only to occur with the combination of wastewater and viable mesophilic biomass at 30 degrees C, in the presence of oxygen. Bioflocculation did not occur in case the biomass was inactivated or when oxygen was absent. Thermophilic activated sludge hardly showed any bioflocculation, also under mesophilic conditions. Despite the differences in bioflocculation behavior, sludge hydrophobicity and sludge zetapotentials were almost similar. Theoretical calculations using the DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Verweij and Overbeek) theory showed that flocculation is unlikely in all cases due to long-range electrostatic forces. These calculations, combined with the fact that bioflocculation actually did occur at 30 degrees C and the unlikelyness of the hydrophobic interaction, point in the direction of bacterial exo-polymers governing bridging flocculation. Polymer interactions are not included in the DLVO theory and may vary as a function of temperature.\nRW Martin Jr, Low-temperature inhibition of the activated sludge process by an industrial discharge containing the azo dye acid black 1. Water Res, January 1, 2005; 39(1): 17-28,\nA municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) receiving industrial dyeing discharge containing acid black 1 (AB1) failed to meet NH(3) and BOD(5) discharge limits, especially for NH(3) during the winter. Dyeing discharge was combined with domestic sewage in volumetric ratios reflecting the range received by the WWTP and fed to sequencing batch reactors at 22 and 7 degrees C. Analysis of the various nitrogen species revealed complete nitrification failure at 7 degrees C with more rapid nitrification failure as the dye concentration increased. Slight nitrification inhibition occurred at 22 degrees C: NH(3) removal decreased from 99.9% for the control compared to only 97.0% removal with dye addition. Dye-bearing wastewater also reduced COD removal by half at 7 degrees C and by one-fifth at 22 degrees C, and increased effluent TSS nearly three-fold at 7 degrees C. Activated sludge quality at 7 degrees C deteriorated after exposure to AB1, as indicated by excessive foaming and the presence of filamentous bacteria and by a decrease in endogenous and exogenous oxygen uptake. Decreasing AB1 loading resulted in partial activated sludge recovery. Eliminating the dye-bearing discharge to the full-scale WWTP led to improved performance bringing the WWTP into compliance with discharge limits.\nX Zhang, Optimized sequence retrieval from single bands of temperature gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of the amplified 16S rDNA fragments from an activated sludge system. J Microbiol Methods, Jan 2005; 60(1): 1-11,\nSequence retrieval from single bands of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gel electrophoresis (DGE) profiles is an important but often difficult step for molecular diversity analysis of complex microbial communities such as activated sludge systems. We analyzed the temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) profiles of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA fragments from an activated sludge sample of a coking wastewater treatment plant. Single bands were excised, and a clone library was constructed for each. Sequence heterogeneity in each single band was found to be significantly overestimated due to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) contamination formed during the PCR amplification, since only 10-60% of library clones of each single TGGE band had identical migration behavior compared with the parent band. Three methods, digestion with mung bean nuclease, optimization of PCR amplification, and purification via denatured polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (d-PAGE), were compared for their ability to minimize ssDNA contamination, with the last one being the most efficient. After using d-PAGE to minimize ssDNA to a nearly nondetectable level, 70-100% of library clones for each single TGGE band had identical migration compared with the parent band. Several sequences were found in each of six single bands, and this co-migration could be predicted with the Poland software. The predominant bacteria of the activated sludge were assessed via a combination of sequence retrieval from each single TGGE band and band intensity analysis. Only beta and alpha subclasses of the Proteobacteria were detected, 93.8% and 6.2%, respectively. Our work suggests that prior to constructing a clone library to retrieve the actual sequence diversity of a single DGE band, it is advisable to minimize ssDNA contamination to a nondetectable level.\nF Morgan-Sagastume, Physicochemical properties and stability of activated sludge flocs under temperature upshifts from 30 to 45 degrees C. J Colloid Interface Sci, Jan 2005; 281(1): 136-45,\nThe impacts of temperature shifts from 30 to 45 degrees C on the structural stability and surface charge of activated sludge flocs were assessed in four sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) treating pulp and paper mill effluent. The improvement in floc stability was tested by sludge magnesium enrichment in one SBR and by operating another reactor at a high sludge retention time (SRT) of 33 days. Floc stability was characterized by dissociation constants with solutions of CaCl(2), KCl, urea, and ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA). Surface charge was assessed by cationic-anionic titration and metals concentrations were also determined. The temperature shift consistently caused an increase in the negative sludge surface charge from approximately -0.180 to -0.300 meq/g MLSS. Magnesium enrichment and a high SRT of 33 days promoted less negatively charged sludge, dampened the increase in negative sludge surface charge, and yielded structurally stronger flocs; however, sludge deflocculation still occurred. Manganese and iron appeared to be released by sludge under the temperature shift. It was concluded that the temperature shift deteriorates the flocculating physicochemical properties of the sludge and that better floc stability achieved by magnesium enrichment and a high SRT is not enough to stop deflocculation. Further research is required to clarify the origin of the increase in negative sludge surface charge, the role of metals, and the governing factors in sludge deflocculation under such temperature shifts.\nM Suresh Kumar, Production of biodegradable plastics from activated sludge generated from a food processing industrial wastewater treatment plant. Bioresour Technol, Dec 2004; 95(3): 327-30,\nMost of the excess sludge from a wastewater treatment plant (60%) is disposed by landfill. As a resource utilization of excess sludge, the production of biodegradable plastics using the sludge has been proposed. Storage polymers in bacterial cells can be extracted and used as biodegradable plastics. However, widespread applications have been limited by high production cost. In the present study, activated sludge bacteria in a conventional wastewater treatment system were induced, by controlling the carbon: nitrogen ratio to accumulate storage polymers. Polymer yield increased to a maximum 33% of biomass (w/w) when the C/N ratio was increased from 24 to 144, where as specific growth yield decreased with increasing C/N ratio. The conditions which are required for the maximum polymer accumulation were optimized and are discussed.\nAS Stasinakis, NS Thomaidis, D Mamais, and TD Lekkas Investigation of Cr(VI) reduction in continuous-flow activated sludge systems. Chemosphere, Dec 2004; 57(9): 1069-77.\nThe aim of this research was to investigate hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), reduction by activated sludge and to evaluate the use of continuous-flow activated sludge systems for the treatment of Cr(VI)-containing wastewater. Three series of experiments were conducted using two parallel lab-scale activated sludge systems. During the first experiment, one system was used as a control, while the other received Cr(VI) concentrations equal to 0.5, 1, 3 and 5mg l(-1). For all concentrations added, approximately 40% of the added Cr(VI) was removed during the activated sludge process. Determination of chromium species in the dissolved and particulate phase revealed that the removed Cr(VI) was sorbed by the activated sludge flocs mainly as trivalent chromium, Cr(III), while the residual chromium in the dissolved phase was mainly detected as Cr(VI). Activated sludge ability to reduce Cr(VI) was independent of the acclimatization of biomass to Cr(VI) and it was not affected by the toxic effect of Cr(VI) on autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms. During the second experiment, both systems were operated under two different hydraulic residence time (theta equal to 20 and 28h) and three different initial organic substrate concentration (COD equal to 300, 150 and 0mg l(-1)). Cr(VI) reduction was favored by an increase of theta, while it was limited by influent COD concentration. Finally, at the last experiment the effect of anoxic and anaerobic reactors on Cr(VI) reduction was investigated. It was observed that the use of an anoxic zone or an anaerobic-anoxic zone ahead of the aerobic reactor favored Cr(VI) reduction, increasing mean percentage Cr(VI) reduction to almost 80%.\nT Widjaja, T Miyata, Y Nakano, W Nishijima, and M Okada Adsorption capacity of powdered activated carbon for 3,5-dichlorophenol in activated sludge. Chemosphere, Dec 2004; 57(9): 1219-24.\nThe objectives of this study were to evaluate the performance of powdered activated carbon treatment (PACT) process based on the adsorption capacity of powdered activated carbon (PAC) in activated sludge and the effect of dissolved organic substances in activated sludge on the adsorption capacity of PAC. The DCP adsorption capacity of three PACs originated from different raw materials (coal, soft coal and sawdust) in activated sludge were 29%, 34% and 17% of that of new PAC, respectively. The performance of PACT process for shock loading of 3,5-dichlorophenol (3,5-DCP) was different among PACs in spite of the same adsorption capacity in new PAC. The performance of PACT process for removal of DCP is dependent not on the adsorption capacity of new PAC but on the adsorption capacity of PAC in the aeration tank. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) with molecular weight smaller than 50kDa did not affect the adsorption capacity of PAC for 3,5-DCP in the activated sludge reactor. DOM with molecular weight larger than 50kDa and biofilm developed on the surface of PAC seemed to be responsible for the decreased adsorption capacity of PAC for the DCP.\nBM Wilen, K Keiding, and PH Nielsen Flocculation of activated sludge flocs by stimulation of the aerobic biological activity. Water Res, Nov 2004; 38(18): 3909-19.\nActivated sludge flocs are known to deflocculate under short-term anaerobic conditions, but little is known about possible reflocculation under subsequent aerobic conditions. When activated sludge flocs from two wastewater treatment plants deflocculated under anaerobic conditions with well-defined shear conditions, they could be almost, but not completely, reflocculated by aeration for 1-2 h under the same shear conditions. If the biological activity was reduced by adding azide, chloramphenicol or by decreasing the temperature, no or only very little reflocculation took place. This indicated that the reflocculation was under direct or indirect microbial control. Only a small part of the reflocculation was due to improved flocculation properties obtained by oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III), which is a better flocculant. Fe(II) was produced under the anaerobic conditions by microbial iron reduction, and it was oxidized to Fe(III) within less than one hour after the aeration was started. However, by comparing two different sludges with different capabilities for iron reduction, iron oxidation and responses to substrate addition, it was found that the aerobic biological activity most likely was of greatest significance for the observed reflocculation and floc formation under aerobic conditions. This was further supported by adding organic substrates (glucose or ethanol) during the aerobic reflocculation phase, which promoted reflocculation. However, some substrates had the opposite effect (acetate and lactate), where a deterioration of the reflocculation was observed, probably due to different responses from different groups of microorganisms in the sludges.\nGA Ekama and MC Wentzel A predictive model for the reactor inorganic suspended solids concentration in activated sludge systems. Water Res, Nov 2004; 38(19): 4093-106.\nA simple predictive model for the activated sludge reactor inorganic suspended solids (ISS) concentration (excluding that from chemical precipitant dosing) is presented. It is based on the accumulation of influent ISS in the reactor and an ordinary heterotrophic organism (OHO) ISS content (fiOHO) of 0.15 mg ISS/mg OHO organic (volatile) suspended solids (VSS) and a variable phosphate accumulating organism (PAO) ISS content (fiPAO) proportional to their P content (fXBGP). Organism ISS content is conceptualized as the uptake of dissolved inorganic solids by active organisms, which when dried in the total suspended solids (TSS) test procedure, precipitate and manifest as ISS. The model is validated with data from 22 investigations conducted over the past 15 years on 30 aerobic and anoxic-aerobic nitrification-denitrification (ND) systems and 18 anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic ND biological excess P removal (BEPR) systems variously fed artificial and real wastewater, and operated from 3 to 20 days sludge age. The predicted reactor VSS/TSS ratio reflects the observed relative sensitivity to sludge age, which is low, and to BEPR, which is high. To use the model for design, two parameters need to be known: (1) the influent ISS concentration, which is not commonly measured in wastewater characterization analyses and (2) the P content of PAOs (fXBGP), which can vary considerably depending on the extent of anoxic P uptake BEPR that takes place in the system. Some guidance on the measurement of influent ISS concentration and selection of the PAO P content to calculate the mixed liquor VSS/TSS ratio for design is given.\nAM Martins, C Picioreanu, JJ Heijnen, and MC Van Loosdrecht Three-dimensional dual-morphotype species modeling of activated sludge flocs. Environ Sci Technol, Nov 2004; 38(21): 5632-41.\nAn individual-based model, originally developed for a biofilm system, was adapted to simulate three-dimensional formation of activated sludge flocs. The model was extended to two different bacterial morphotypes (floc-forming and filamentous bacteria), allowing spatial development of the floc according to the bacterial morphology, diffusion, reaction, and growth processes. The model needed also extension with a process for attachment of individual cells. Despite being in an early stage of development, the model is already a tool that enables us to obtain useful information about the microfloc environment. The model indicates that filamentous bacterial morphology and substrate microgradients are important aspects in the formation of bacterial structures. In mass transport-limited regimes filamentous bacterial structures prevail, whereas in growth-limited regimes irregular shaped flocs with fingerlike structures are dominant. These modeling results suggest that activated sludge flocs and biofilms might be different manifestations of the same phenomena. The model results support the hypothesis that floc-macrogradients can be the most important parameter for development of bulking sludge. The model suggests that attachment has a very strong effect on floc structure, leading to enhancement of the effect of substrate microgradients.\nYS Ho, Comment on \"Sorption of basic dyes from aqueous solution by activated sludge\" [J. Hazard. Mater. 108 (2004) 183-188]. J Hazard Mater, Oct 2004; 114(1-3): 241-5.\nThe adsorption of dyes in the solutions using activated sludge might be a promising approach in wastewater treatment units. The adsorption of Basic Red 18 and Basic Blue 9 from aqueous solution by dried activated sludge was investigated with in a batch system. The activated sludge had the highest dye uptake capacity, having the monolayer adsorption capacity 285.71 and 256.41 mg g\u22121 for Basic Red 18 and Basic Blue 9, respectively, at pH value of 7.0 and 20 \u00b0C. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models were used for the mathematical description of the adsorption equilibrium and the equilibrium data fixed very well with both the Langmuir and Freundlich models. The RL values showed that, activated sludge was favorable for the adsorption of basic dyes. The suitability of the kinetic models for the adsorption of dyes on the activated sludge was also discussed. It was clear that the adsorption kinetics of dyes to dried activated sludge obeyed pseudo second-order adsorption kinetics.\nEnviron Technol. 2004 Jun;25(6):723-31. [Rheological measurement used as a tool to assess sludges settleability] Guibaud G, Dollet P, Tixier N, Dagot C, Baudu M. Laboratoire des Sciences de l'Eau et de l'Environnement, Faculte des Sciences et Techniques, 123, avenue Albert Thomas, 87060 Limoges, France. The activated sludge process is the most widely used biological wastewater treatment method. The measurement of some physico-chemical parameters in aeration tanks do not still allow to avoid clarification operation failure. This study focus on the ability to apply rheological measurements on activated sludge at standard concentrations in order to assess sludge settleability. Measurements in shear flow show a pseudonewtonian region which corresponds to the maximum dispersion of the suspensions that can be detected with the rotational system used. The Bingham's viscosity and shear stress are used to characterise activated sludge. Different shear sensitivities of flocs seem to result from various operational conditions of activated sludge process. Significant relationships with different parameters of settleability point out the ability of Bingham's shear stress to express the compressibility of the activated sludge. According to the protocol of measurement of the study, Bingham's shear stress may influence the nature of the sludge on its settleability.\nActivated sludge consists of a mixed community of microorganisms that metabolize and transform organic and inorganic substances into environmentally acceptable forms. The typical microbiology of activated sludge consists of approximately 95% bacteria and 5% higher organisms (protozoa, rotifers, and higher forms of invertebrates). The term \"activated sludge\" refers to a biological process. This process cannot be monitored without using a biological tool: the microscope. Nitrification and Denitrification in the Activated Sludge Process, the first in a series on the microbiology of wastewater treatment, comprises the critical topics of cost-effective operation, permit compliance, process control, and troubleshooting in wastewater treatment plants. Avoiding the technical jargon, chemical equations, and kinetics that typically accompany such texts, Nitrification and Denitrification in the Activated Sludge Process directly addresses plant operators and technicians, providing necessary information for understanding the microbiology and biological conditions that occur in the treatment process. k , l . In the activated sludge process wastewater enters an aerated tank. Here bacterial particles are brought in contact with the organic material in the wastewater. The bacteria utilize the organics in wastewater as food. In the second stage of the aeration tank, bacteria known as nitrifying bacteria predominate.\nWei Sheng Yan Jiu. 2004 Mar;33(2):137-9.

Institute of Environmental Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. OBJECTIVE: In order to screen the dominant bacteria for degrading endocrine disruptor di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP). METHODS: The activated sludge was acclimated by DBP as sole carbon source. DBP concentration was increased progressively. 5 strains were isolated from the sludge by the plane-table after 10 weeks, 1 strain of which grew and degraded DBP well. RESULTS: By orthogonal test, it was indicated that the appropriate degradation conditions of DBP for this best strain were degradation time 32 h, DBP concentration 200 mg/L, rate of shaking incubator 100 r/min, pH 7.0, temperature 30 degrees C. The degraded rate of DBP is more than 95% under above conditions. CONCLUSION: The bacterium was identified as Pseudomonas.\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2003 Nov;24(6):116-20.

National Key Laboratory of PCRR, School of Environment, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China. Degradation kinetics of the purified terephthalic acid (PTA) petrochemical wastewater with the functional strain Fhhh was conducted in this research. Inputting the values of the 6 kinetics parameters obtained from the test, the values of the natural parameter and the values of the standard parameters for discharging wastewater into the environmental biotechnological informatics software (Ebis), the minimum reactor volume (Vmin) required and the specific degradation rate (qA) were calculated based on the activated sludge process. The minimum value of Vmin was 1309 m3 as well as the highest value of qA was 0.0136 h-1 among the Fhhh preparations kept in three different methods. The highest value of Fhhh qA was 4 fold of that of the native bacterium YZ1, and higher than that of the data published by 4 researchers and lower than that of by 2 researchers. The results show that Fhhh has the obvious potential for the degradation of PTA wastewater.\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2003 Nov;24(6):112-5. [The use of chemical uncoupler to reduce sludge yield in activated sludge process] Ye F, Chen Y, Feng X. Department of Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310029, China. yefenxia@hotmail.com To determine whether chemical additions can be used to reduce sludge production in biological wastewater treatment, 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCS), served as a metabolic uncoupler was added to activated sludge cultures. The batch tests have confirmed that TCS is an effective chemical uncoupler in reducing the sludge yield when its concentration is higher than 1.0 mg/L. It was showed that TCS was able to reduce sludge yield by approximately 50% when the TCS concentration was 6.0 mg/L. It was also revealed that substrate removal capability and effluent nitrogen concentration were not affected adversely by the presence of TCS when TCS was dosed every other day in a range of 2.0-3.6 mg/L during the 40 d operation of activated sludge batch cultures. Such a sludge growth reduction is associated with the enhancement of microbial activities in terms of the SOUR and dehydrogenase activity. Sludge settleability from the treated and control samplers was comparable and not significantly different. Meanwhile, there was a finding that the filamentous bacteria still grow in sludge floc in the control reactor after 40 d operation. These results suggested that it might be possible to apply TCS in activated sludge systems to reduce the excess sludge yield.\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2003 Nov;24(6):83-9. [Aerobic biodegradation performance of six volatile organic compounds by activated sludge acclimated with toluene] Zhang H, Hu H, Xi J. State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. The degradation performance of six volatile organic compounds (VOCs), toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, benzene and chlorobenzene by activated sludge acclimated with toluene were studied. The experimental results showed that the biodegradation rates of o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, benzene and chlorobenzene increased with increasing of their initial liquid concentration; when concentrations of o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, benzene and chlorobenzene were less than 149 mg/L, 129 mg/L, 133 mg/L, 234 mg/L and 146 mg/L respectively, neither of them brought any notable inhibition or poisonous effects on microbes, and their aerobic biodegradation accorded with first-order reaction. When concentrations of toluene were more than 85 mg/L, its biodegradation rate didn't increase with increasing of its initial liquid concentration and the biodegradation of toluene accorded with the Monod equation.\nYing Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao. 2003 Nov;14(11):1929-33. [Biodegradation of herbicide pendimethalin by fungi and its characteristics] Lin A, Zhu L, Wang J, Liu A, Sun R. Shandong Agricultural University, Taian 271018, China. Fungi, which can grow on and degrade pendimethalin, were isolated from activated sludge and soil. The biodegradation characterization in vitro was studied. The results showed that pendimethalin could be degraded by fungi, 16 fungi were isolated by enrichment culture, among which, 10 fungi could degrade more than 60% pendimethalin in 5 days in culture fluid. According to the physiological resistance and the capacity to degrade pendimethalin, three fungi were considered as efficiently degrading strains identified as Aspergillus terreus, Monilochaetes and Aspergillus furnigatus. The efficiency of degradation was affected by culture conditions such as pH, temperature, and concentration of cane sugar and pendimethanlin. The results showed that when the additional carbon source was 0.5%-1.0%, pH value was 6-8, and cultivated temperature was 20-30 degrees C, the growth amount of fungi and the degradation rate were enhanced. The fungi grew quickly, and the biodegradation rate was high under pendimethalin concentration being 100 mg.L-1. The removed amount of pendimethalin increased with increasing pendimethalin concentration. The optimal conditions were proposed, which could provide theoretic basis for prevention and control of pesticides pollution.\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2003 Jul;24(4):99-104. [Studies on aerobic granular sludge cultivated under selective pressure] Wang Q, Chen J, Du G. Key Laboratory of Industrial Biotechnology Under Ministry of Education, Southern Yangtze University, Wuxi 214036, China. As inoculum sludge from a conventional COD removal activated sludge wastewater treatment plant was used, aerobic granular sludge was cultured in sequencing batch reactor (SBR) fed with glucose as carbon substrate. The SBR was operated with decreasing sedimentation time and increasing COD loading rate resulting in the selective pressure to enhance the formation of granular sludge. According to morphology change of sludge, the generation of granule could be divided into three stage. Granules started to appear after 67 days operation. After increasing COD loading rate to 4.8 kg/(m3.d), and superficial gas velocity to 0.0175 m/s, granules were the dominant sludge forms with diameter about 6-9 mm, the minimal settling velocity of 32.7 m/h, and the MLSS of 7800 mg/L. Aerobic granular sludge demonstrates high activity and ability to withstand high COD loading rate. The properties of aerobic granular sludges and the effect of different operational conditions on the formation of these aerobic granules were also analyzed preliminarily.\nThese bacteria utilize ammonia as food, and through a two stage process convert ammonia into nitrate. The bacteria naturally clump together forming particles called floc. After the wastewater is discharged from the aeration tank, a clarifier separates the floc, or suspended solids from the treated wastewater. Low aeration basin dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration for the applied organic loading (F/M) leads to filamentous bulking by several filaments.The required aeration basin DO concentration to prevent \"low DO bulking\" is not a constant, rather, is a function of the F/M rate (see Palm et al. JWPCF 52: 2484, 1980). Simply, higher bulk DO is required to prevent the growth of these filaments as the F/M increases, due to faster oxygen use within the floc at higher F/M, oxygen depletion inside the floc, and the need to maintain aerobic conditions in the interior of the floc. A higher bulk DO concentration increases the diffusion of oxygen into the floc interiors. f , g , k . In general, a bulk DO concentration of 2.0 mg/L is recommended for F/M values up to 0.5, typical of most domestic waste plants. This DO concentration should be maintained at the point of greatest oxygen demand in the system, for example, at the headend of a plug-flow system (not the backend).\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2003 Jul;24(4):94-8.

Department of Environmental Science and Technology, Hunan University, Changsha 410082, China. The cultivation of aerobic granular sludge used for nitrogen removal in Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) fed with a synthetic municipal wastewater was investigated. The results showed that the aerobic granular sludge with the high activity of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification, could form in the reactor by controlling the addition of carbon source, and the removal rates of COD and NH3-N reached 74.0%-92.8% and 82.3%-98.5%, respectively, in the reactor. The granular formed was averagely 0.5-1.0 mm in diameter, and the Mixed Liquid Suspended Solids (MLSS) and the Sludge Volumetric Index (SVI) in the reactor were above 4.5 g/L and above 32.5, respectively. Compared with the normal aerobic activated sludge process, the system with aerobic granular sludge had a higher concentration of effective biomass and a much stronger ability of nitrogen removal.\nGig Sanit. 2003 May-Jun;(3):11-4.

Aiming at printing ink wastewater, a strain of bacterium was isolated from activated sludge, and identified as Aerobacillus fusiformis. The Aerobacillus fusiformis was respectively immobilized in calcium alginate gel, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and microporous ceramics and their microstructure were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). It was found that calcium alginate gel might dissolve in the wastewater, and the activity was restricted as cells wrapped in PVA, so the COD removal ratio was low. The method of immobilized cells using microporous ceramics is simple and COD removal efficiency can be achieved. In addition, the immobilized bacterium could not be separated easily from the ceramics in the wastewater.\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2003 May;24(3):65-9. [Treatment of carbonization effluent by the ultrasonic radiation and activated sludge process] Ning P, Xu J, Huang D, Ma X, Xu X, Li Z. School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunmimg 650093, China. The paper deals with the degradation of organic pollutants by the ultrasonic irradiation-activated sludge process. The treatment of the real coking wastewater of Kunming coke making-gas plant was studied with the water quality model. Using the ultrasonic irradiation-activated sludge process the organic pollutants in the real coking wastewater can be degraded effectively. The influence factors of the ultrasonic degradation effect such as initial concentration, aerated gas and ultrasonic density were investigated and mechanism was explored. The result shows that the ultrasonic degradation effect was high with the decrease of initial concentration of the CODCr, the presence of aerated gas and the increase of ultrasonic density. At the initial CODCr concentration of 807 mg/L, when air acted as aerated gas and only air itself (no ultrasound) was exerted on the wastewater, the degradation rate of the CODCr will be 4.5%. However, when the ultrasound of the intensity of 119.4 kW/m2 was exerted on the wastewater, the degradation rate of the CODCr will be 65%. Compared with the activated sludge process alone, the combination of the ultrasonic irradiation and activated sludge process can increase the degradation rate of the CODCr from 45% to 81%. The oxygen consumption rate of the carbonization effluent obviously decreased in the presence of the activated sludge. This shows the carbonization effluent is not biotoxic behind the ultrasonic irradiation.\nWei Sheng Yan Jiu. 2003 May;32(3):187-9. [Study on biodegraded characteristics of endocrine disruptor di-n-butyl phthalate] Wang L, Luo Q. Institute of Environmental Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. The biodegraded Characteristics of di-n-butyl Phthalate (DBP), endocrine disruptor were studied. The activated sludge was acclimated using DBP as the only carbon in the culture medium. DBP concentration was increased progressively from 0.05 g/L to 0.5 g/L. The degradation tests were carried out on the constant temperature table using the acclimated sludge at different PH, temperature, DBP concentration and hydraulic residence time. The results showed that DBP could be rapidly degraded-nearly 90% in 48 hours. The appropriate condition for DBP degradation was pH 6.0-8.0, temperature 25 degrees C-35 degrees C, DBP concentration no more than 300 mg/L, and hydraulic residence time 12 h-24 h. The form of biodegradation of DBP can be described as the first-order reaction model.\nSome industrial waste systems and high rate domestic plants operated at higher F/M may need higher DO values than 2.0 mg/L due to oxygen diffusion limitations. Type 1701 bulking has occurred in an oxygen activated sludge plant operated at high F/M at a DO concentration of 12-14 mg/L, which was cured by raising the DO to 20 mg/L. As a rule, always trust the microscopic observation of low DO filaments to indicate oxygen limitation rather than the aeration basin DO values. Control of low DO bulking is by raising the aeration basin DO concentration and by raising the aeration basin MLSS concentration (decreasing the F/M). Note that this action is opposite to what intuition directs: to reduce the MLSS concentration, since less biomass needs less oxygen (wrong! -the F/M is increased at lower MLSS concentration and oxygen needs increase). Filamentous bulking is common in completely-mixed, lower F/M systems. a , d , d , e , c . Here, a number of filaments can cause bulking (see Table 1) because they grow better than most activated sludge floc-forming bacteria at low aeration basin BOD concentration. Intermittently-fed and plug-flow systems are more resistant to this type of bulking. Control of low F/M bulking is by reducing the aeration basin MLSS concentration and increasing the F/M (manipulating the \"M\" component). Lowering the MLSS concentration may not be suitable for many plants as this may cause the loss of nitrification and increase waste sludge production.\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2003 Mar;24(2):97-101. [Biodegradable plastic production by activated sludge with different carbon sources] Lin D, Zhang Y, Wei C, Shen J. Department of Applied Chemistry, South China University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou 510640, China. Polyhydroxyalkanoates(PHAs) are polyesters synthesized by numerous bacteria in sludge as intracellular carbon and energy storage compounds under the condition of unbalance growth. Another important aspect of PHAs is thermoplastic polyester with the remarkable characteristics of biodegradability. In this paper, using sodium acetate, sodium propionate and sodium butyrate as the unique carbon source, 5.58%, 3.90% and 4.98% PHAs of dry sludge weight were obtained by assimilated sludge as PHAs synthesis strains in the anaerobic condition, and 12.32%, 9.55% and 11.35% PHAs of dry sludge weight were obtained in the anaerobic condition. It was shown that there were large quantities strains which could accumulate PHAs as granules in the cytoplasm of cells, and the yield of PHAs in the anaerobic process were higher than that in the aerobic process. The best result was that 12.32% PHAs of dry sludge weight was obtained in the best experiment condition, and the yield of the PHAs to substrate was 30.65%. The structures of PHAs were analyzed by 1HNMR spectrum, and the relationship of the structure of PHAs and the carbon source was explained.\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2003 Jan;24(1):75-9. [Effects of phenol presence on the biodegradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol in a bioaugmented system] Quan X, Shi H, Wang J, Qian Y. State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. Special culture for 2,4-Dichlorophenol(2,4-DCP) degradation were supplemented to an activated sludge system and the effects of the presence of phenol at various concentration on the removal of 2,4-DCP were studied. In addition, the changes of the removal rate of 2,4-DCP and phenol under the long existence of phenol was investigated in semicontinuous test. Results show than the presence of phenol at the concentration of 10 mg/L, 50 mg/L, 100 mg/L and 300 mg/L inhibit the biodegradation of 2,4-DCP and the inhibition increased with increasing of phenol concentration. 2, 4-DCP biodegradation rate declined with the run of semi-continuous test, while the biodegradation rate of phenol was much faster than the first run.\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2002 Sep;23(5):84-7. [The kinetics of biological treatment of bleaching liquor from straw pulp process] Zhang J, Huang X, Ding W, Wang X. ESPC State Key Joint Laboratory, Dept. of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. zhangjian00@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn The batch test of oxygen uptake rate (OUR) measurement was used to simulate biochemical reaction process in aerobic reactor treating bleaching liquor from straw pulp process. Lawrence-McCarty kinetic model was used to analyze the biochemical reaction process. The kinetic equation of bleaching liquor biological treatment, v = 0.72 S/(60.43 + S), was deduced from results of the OUR experiment and the bench experiment. The specific substrate degradation rate estimated by the kinetic equation was higher than that of practical wastewater treatment plant. The phenomenon was attributed to the decrease of activated sludge activity caused by cellulose suspended solid accumulation in aerobic reactor of practical plant.\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2002 Sep;23(5):76-9.

Environmental Science Institute, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510640, China, ceyren@scut.edu.cn Among 16 bacteria that were screened out from 5 activated sludge, S-2, Y-3, XH-3 and their mixed strains M-3 were selected to biodegrade MGP (Manufacture gas from petroleum)-wastewater. They can remove 38.4%-44.0% CODCr, 95.4%-97.0% hydroxybenzene and 47.1%-53.7% aromatic compound after 60 h treatment, but the removal rate of NH4(+)-N was only 14.0%-17.6%. About 77 toxic organic compounds were detected by GC/MS analysis, the aromatic compounds which had 3 rings and 4-6 rings can be biodegraded by the bacteria. The removal rate of CODCr, NH4(+)-N and extractable organic compound were improved 13.1%-22.9%, 18.4%-22.7% and 13.1%-18.1% respectively when glucose was added in the wastewater, and when ethanol was existing in the wastewater, the corresponding increase were 12.5%-21.2%, 29.7%-42.2% and 6.7%-7.7%. The total removal rates of aromatic compound were increased 17.7%-21.7%, 15.4%-21.2%. The screened strains can improve the biodegradation rate of MGP-wastewater.\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2002 Sep;23(5):72-5.

State Key Laboratory of Environmental Aquatic Chemistry, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China. In this paper, biosorption efficiency of heavy metals by bacteria isolated from activated sludge was tested. It was shown that Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes and Micrococcus luteus GC subgroup B had high biosorption capacities for Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions. The adsorption of the two ions on Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes and Micrococcus luteus GC subgroup B exhibited Langmuir adsorption behavior with regression coefficient of 0.99. The pH value was the most important effect factor on biosorption of metal ions. The biosorption kinetic curves of Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions by cells showed two processes: rapid sorption on cell surface and slowly longer-term transformation into cells. Cu(II) ion can be desorbed effectively from cells of Micrococcus luteus GC subgroup B.\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2001 Nov;22(6):61-5. [Non-filamentous activated sludge bulking caused by the deficiency of nitrogen] Gao C, Peng Y, Wang S, Chen Y. College of Environment and Energy Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100022, China. The effect of nitrogen deficiency on activated sludge bulking was studied specially in some experiments carried on a sequencing batch reactor fed with beer wastewater in this paper. The experimental results showed that the sludge settled properly at a influent BOD/N value of 100/4. When the value of BOD/N was 100/3 and 100/2 respectively, non-filamentous activated sludge bulking caused by an excessive growth of viscous Zoogloea with high moisture content occurred. When the value of influent BOD/N was 100/0.94, more serious non-filamentous bulking occurred. Furthermore, the effect of nitrogen deficiency on the nitrogen sources and phosphorus sources utilization rate and the COD removal rate was studied in the experiments.\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2001 Nov;22(6):44-8.

Laboratoire des Sciences de l'Eau et de l'Environnement, Faculte des Sciences, ENSIL-Parc ESTER-16, Limoges France. The paper discusses the design and performance of package sewage treatment plants using the Intermittently Decanted Extended Aeration Process (IDEA-Process) in a tropical climate. This hybrid SBR process has been developed overcome traditional drawbacks associated with the SBR process, such as high Sludge Volume Index, high weir loading rate for decanting, and the need to achieve a better effluent quality, especially in terms of nutrient removal. Three domestic sewage plants in Thailand has been selected for field-testing and results of analyses are presented. The average measured biological removal efficiencies in terms of BOD removal and COD removal are about 95.5% and 90% respectively, and the average total nitrogen removal efficiency is about 90%. A computer model is used to study the performance of IDEA-processes compared to results from laboratory tests. The model experience gained through this research are discussed regarding the limitations of computer models such as ASM 1 (Activated Sludge Model n degrees 1) applied to the IDEA-Process in order to develop a new computer model suitable for design and operation of package treatment plant using IDEA-Process Technology in the future.\nNippon Hoigaku Zasshi. 2001 Jul;55(2):247-54. [Legal and technical issues of formalin disposition in association with autopsy] [Article in Japanese] Nakajima M, Yoshida K. Department of Forensic Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo 113-0033 Japan. The Ministry of Public Welfare notified on the disposition of formalin, which was used in the histological examination in association with forensic or pathological autopsy. However, those who concerned on the issue had not known exactly how they dispose formalin. The news on the illegal disposition of formalin from our department drew attention to the legal disposition of formalin. These situations led us to investigate the legal and technical aspects of formalin disposition. We examined the legally-described methods such as oxidation, incineration and activated sludge processes and other methods such as formose, supercritical water oxidation, and wet oxidation processes. From legal point of view, we must process poisonous formaldehyde into non-poisonous products under the control of The Poisonous and Peleterious? Substances Control Law. Additionally, the products are under the control of The Sewage Water Law and Water Pollution Control Law, particularly in terms of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD). After careful investigation, we tentatively conclude that incineration method is the best at present, though the supercritical oxidation and wet oxidation processes may be better in order to cope with the worldwide movement toward the control of environmental hormones and warm climate.

Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China. A strain of Bacillus megaterium screened from activated sludge could produce exocellular flocculant. The flocculant was purified through ethanol precipitation and Sephadex S-500 column chromatography. The purified flocculant BP25 was assayed by Bradford reaction, agarose gel electrophoresis and Sulfate-phenol method. The results showed that BP25 was a kind of polysaccharide which contains 36.97% O, 6.28% H, 47.00% C, 0% No NMR assay showed BP-25 contains no uronic acid. Gas-chromatography assay combined with thin-layer chromatography of acid hydralate revealed that BP25 contains Glucose and Mannose with the mole ratio of 4:1. Methylation analysis revealed the polysaccharide contains alpha-1, 6 glycosidicbond and alpha-1, 3 glycosidicbond. The main chains are comprised of Glucose and all the Mannose are in the side chains.

[A comparison between a submerged membrane bioreactor and a conventional activated sludge process] Rui L, Xia H, Ruopeng L, Yi Q. ESPC State Key Joint Laboratory, Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. A comparison between a submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR) and a conventional activated sludge process (CAS) was carried out under similar operational conditions. MBR demonstrated a more stable and excellent effluent quality than CAS. Its effluent COD concentration was 55.5 mg/L on average, much lower than that of CAS (79.7 mg/L). Soluble microbial products accumulated in the MBR during the first 120 days in operation due to membrane interception of macromolecules, but these accumulated substances were degraded at last with microbial acclimation. No similar phenomenon was observed in the CAS system. Compositions of the CAS effluent, MBR supernatant and membrane permeate were found quite different. In the CAS effluent and MBR supernatant, both macromolecules with MW > 60,000 and small molecules with MW < 3,000 were dominant and macromolecules had a much larger occupation in the MBR supernatant. In the membrane permeate, however, small molecules with MW < 3,000 were the major component. The relatively small floc size in the MBR was proved favorable to improve oxygen transfer rate.\nAny change in operation that effectively increases the substrate concentration available to the activated sludge and introduces batch or plug-flow characteristics to the aeration basin, even on a short term basis, will help control low F/M bulking. These include: compartmentalization of aeration basins; fed-batch operation; intermittent feeding of wastes; and use of a selector. These latter methods do not reduce the MLSS concentration in the system. A selector is a mixing basin or channel where RAS and influent wastes mix prior to the aeration basin. Selector design is empirical at this time. Successful examples involve a 15-30 minute contact time of the RAS and influent waste; are aerated; and achieve at 70-80% removal of soluble BOD5 through the selector. Several newer designs are either operated anoxic (no free oxygen but nitrate present) or anaerobic, however, these are too new to state their general usefulness. A selector can be too large or too small in size to properly function. The goal is to provide a short term, high substrate condition which favors certain floc-formers but which discourages filaments. f , j , g , h , d . These floc-formers appear to rapidly store BOD as cellular storage products in the selector, which they use later for growth in the main aeration basin (they pack their own \"lunch bags\" in the selector). If the selector is too large, the substrate concentration achieved may not be high enough to encourage these special floc-formers and discourage filaments. If too small, insufficient time may be available for substrate uptake and storage.\nIndian J Environ Health. 2001 Apr;43(2):1-82. Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor--a review. Bal AS, Dhagat NN. National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nehru Marg, Nagpur 440 020, India. Biological treatment of wastewater basically reduces the pollutant concentration through microbial coagulation and removal of non-settleable organic colloidal solids. Organic matter is biologically stabilized so that no further oxygen demand is exerted by it. The biological treatment requires contact of the biomass with the substrate. Various advances and improvements in anaerobic reactors to achieve variations in contact time and method of contact have resulted in development of in suspended growth systems, attached growth or fixed film systems or combinations thereof. Although anaerobic systems for waste treatment have been used since late 19th century, they were considered to have limited treatment efficiencies and were too slow to serve the needs of a quickly expanding wastewater volume, especially in industrialized and densely populated areas. At present aerobic treatment is the most commonly used process to reduce the organic pollution level of both domestic and industrial wastewaters. Aerobic techniques, such as activated sludge process, trickling filters, oxidation ponds and aerated lagoons, with more or less intense mixing devices, have been successfully installed for domestic wastewater as well as industrial wastewater treatment. Anaerobic digestion systems have undergone modifications in the last two decades, mainly as a result of the energy crisis.\nMajor developments have been made with regard to anaerobic metabolism, physiological interactions among different microbial species, effects of toxic compounds and biomass accumulation. Recent developments however, have demonstrated that anaerobic processes might be an economically attractive alternative for the treatment of different types of industrial wastewaters and in (semi-) tropical areas also for domestic wastewaters. The anaerobic degradation of complex, particulate organic matter has been described as a multistep process of series and parallel reactions. It involves the decomposition of organic and inorganic matter in the absence of molecular oxygen. Complex polymeric materials such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids (fat and grease) are first hydrolyzed to soluble products by extracellular enzymes, secreted by microorganisms, so as to facilitate their transport or diffusion across the cell membrane. These relatively simple, soluble compounds are fermented or anaerobically oxidized, further to short-chain fatty acids, alcohols, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and ammonia. The short-chain fatty acids (other than acetate) are converted to acetate, hydrogen gas, and carbon dioxide. Methanogenesis finally occurs from the reduction of carbon dioxide and acetate by hydrogen. The initial stage of anaerobic degradation, i.e. acid fermentation is essentially a constant BOD stage because the organic molecules are only rearranged. The first stage does not stabilize the organics in the waste. However this step is essential for the initiation of second stage methane fermentation as it converts the organic material to a form, usable by the methane producing bacteria. The second reaction is initiated when anaerobic methane forming bacteria act upon the short chain organic acids produced in the 1st stage. Here these acids undergo methane fermentation with carbon dioxide acting as hydrogen acceptor and getting reduced to methane. The methane formed, being insoluble in water, escapes from the system and can be tapped and used as an energy source. The production and subsequent escape of methane causes the stabilization of the organic material. The methane-producing bacteria consist of several different groups. Each group has the ability to ferment only specific compounds. Therefore, the bacterial consortia in a methane producing system should include a number of different groups. When the rate of bacterial growth is considered, then the retention time of the solids becomes important parameter. The acid fermentation stage is faster as compared to the methane fermentation stage. This means that a sudden increase in the easily degradable organics will result in increased acid production with subsequent accumulation of acids. This inhibits the methanogenesis step. Acclimatization of the microorganisms to a substrate has been reported to take more than five weeks. Sufficiently acclimated bacteria have shown greater stability towards stress-inducing events such as hydraulic overloads, fluctuations in temperature, fluctuations in volatile acid and ammonia concentrations etc. Several environmental factors can affect anaerobic digestion, by altering the parameters such as specific growth rate, decay rate, gas production, substrate utilization, start-up and response to changes in input. It has long been recognized that an anaerobic process is in many ways ideal for wastewater treatment and has following merits: A high degree of waste stabilization A low production of excess A low nutrient requirements No oxygen requirement Production of methane gas Anaerobic microorganisms, especially methanogens have a slow growth rate.\nAt lower HRTs, the possibility of washout of biomass is more prominent. This makes it difficult to maintain the effective number of useful microorganisms in the system. To maintain the population of anaerobes, large reactor volumes or higher HRTs are required. This may ultimately provide longer SRTs upto 20 days for high rate systems. Thus, provision of larger reactor volumes or higher HRTs ultimately lead to higher capital cost. Among notable disadvantages, it has low synthesis/reaction rate hence long start up periods and difficulty in recovery from upset conditions. Special attention is, therefore, warranted towards, controlling the factors that affect process adversely; important among them being environmental factors such as temperature, pH and concentration of toxic substances. The conventional anaerobic treatment process consists of a reactor containing waste and biological solids (bacteria) responsible for the digestion process. Concentrated waste (usually sewage sludge) can be added continuously or periodically (semi-batch operation), where it is mixed with the contents of the reactor. Theoretically, the conventional digester is operated as a once-through, completely mixed, reactor. In this particular mode of operation the hydraulic retention time (HRT) is equal to the solids retention time (SRT). Basically, the required process efficiency is related to the sludge retention time (SRT), and hence longer SRT provided, results in satisfactory population (by reproduction) for further waste stabilization. By reducing the hydraulic retention time (HRT) in the conventional mode reactor, the quantity of biological solids within the reactor is also decreased as the solids escape with the effluent. The limiting HRT is reached when the bacteria are removed from the reactor faster than they can grow. Methanogenic bacteria are slow growers and are considered the rate-limiting component in the anaerobic digestion process. The first anaerobic process developed, which separated the SRT from the HRT was the anaerobic contact process. In 1963, Young and McCarty (1968) began work, which eventually led to the development of the anaerobic upflow filter (AF) process. The anaerobic filter represented a significant advance in anaerobic waste treatment, since the filter can trap and maintain a high concentration of biological solids. By trapping these solids, long SRT's could be obtained at large waste flows, necessary to anaerobically treat low strength wastes at nominal temperatures economically.\nAnother anaerobic process which relies on the development of biomass on the surfaces of a media is an expanded bed upflow reactor. The primary concept of the process consists of passing wastewater up through a bed of inert sand sized particles at sufficient velocities to fluidize and partially expand the sand bed. One of the more interesting new processes is the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket process (UASB), which was developed by Lettinga and his co-workers in Holland in the early 1970's. The key to the process was the discovery that anaerobic sludge inherently has superior flocculation and settling characteristics, provided the physical and chemical conditions for sludge flocculation are favorable. When these conditions are met, a high solids retention time (at high HRT loadings) can be achieved, with separation of the gas from the sludge solids. The UASB reactor is one of the reactor types with high loading capacity. It differs from other processes by the simplicity of its design. UASB process is a combination of physical & biological processes. The main feature of physical process is separation of solids and gases from the liquid and that of biological process is degradation of decomposable organic matter under anaerobic conditions. No separate settler with sludge return pump is required, as in the anaerobic contact process. There is no loss of reactor volume through filter or carrier material, as in the case with the anaerobic filter and fixed film reactor types, and there is no need for high rate effluent recirculation and concomitant pumping energy, as in the case with fluidized bed reactor. Anaerobic sludge inherently possesses good settling properties, provided the sludge is not exposed to heavy mechanical agitation. For this reason mechanical mixing is generally omitted in UASB-reactors. At high organic loading rates, the biogas production guarantees sufficient contact between substrate and biomass. Regarding the dynamic behaviour of the water phase UASB reactor approaches the completely mixed reactor. For achieving the required sufficient contact between sludge and wastewater, the UASB-system relies on the agitation brought about by the natural gas production and on an even feed inlet distribution at the bottom of the reactor.

[Evaluation of bacterial and polluting loads of effluent from activated sludge wastewater treatment plants in Yaounde, Cameroon] Njine T, Monkiedje A, Nola M, Foko VS. Laboratoire de biologie generale, Faculte des sciences, Universite de Yaounde 1, BP 812 Yaounde, Cameroun. tnjine@uycdc.uninet.com Activated sludge wastewater treatment plants in Yaounde are plagued by failures in their operation. A microbiological and physico-chemical study was carried out on wastewater effluent of an hospital, university campus, and two residential areas made up of more than 2,000 apartments connected to two collective sewase systems. Wastewater sampling was performed in the form of daily cycles during which composite samples were made every two hours with samples collected every half hour. Variables measured included incoming flow rates, suspended solids, pH, electrical conductivity, ammonia nitrogen, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (combination of ammonia and organic nitrogen) and total reactive phosphorus, BOD5 and COD. Microorganisms were isolated on selective culture media using membrane filter procedures. The results obtained show that effluent discharged in receiving waters are, in general, not treated. The suspended solids contents of raw sewage range from 120 to 2,600 mg/l.\nAlso, a selector that is too small may cause the floc-formers to shunt carbonaceous substrate to exocellular polymer which can increase the SVI of the sludge (\"slime bulking\") and pose problems in waste sludge dewatering. The best approach is to try several selector sizes, using a larger basin or channel with movable baffles or exit gates. Use of a variable wastewater bypass around the selector can achieve the same objective and allow the operator some control over the selector. Selectors are specific tools to combat low F/M filaments and are not needed by all plants. Inappropriate selector use may made the problem worse (for example, where bulking is caused by low DO, nutrient deficiency or waste septicity). Influent wastewater septicity is usually indicated by odors (H2S or \"rotten egg\" smell) and a dark color to the wastewater, caused by precipitated ferric sulfide. Septic wastes contain elevated amounts of sulfides and low molecular weight organic acids (such as acetic and butyric acids), both of which encourage the growth of certain filaments (see Table 1). Observation of these filaments with intracellular sulfur granules is a tip-off of a septicity problem. Septicity is more common in systems in warmer climates and in those with large wastewater collection systems that have lift stations and force mains. Waste septicity can be treated by preaeration (which releases odors), by chemical oxidation (chlorine, hydrogen peroxide or potassium permanganate), by chemical precipitation (ferric chloride), or use of sodium nitrate in the collection system as an \"oxygen source\". e , h , c , a , e . Septicity can originate within plant processes. Common sources of septicity include equalization basins, primary and secondary clarifiers, and\u00e8return streams from sludge processing. These can be tested for sulfide or organic acid concentration to determine whether they are a significant source of septicity. A sulfide concentration >1-2 mg/L and an organic acid concentration >100 mg/L favors filament growth. Sulfide can be tested for using one of the simple sulfide test kits available commercially (such as by HACH). Organic acids can be tested for using distillation and titration as per Standard Methods (the same test as for digesters).\nIn General Hospital a mean value of suspended solids of 31.8 mg/l was obtained for treated wastewater. pH values of both raw and treated sewage range from 6 to 8.5 units. Mean values of the conductivity of treated and raw wastewater range from 449.7 to 1,038.3 microseconds/cm. The TKN contents of untreated wastewater are comprised between 36 and 259.2 mg/l. These values range from 5 to 20 mg/l for treated effluent in the General Hospital plant. Large amounts of total hydrolysable phosphorus varying from 3.8 to 27.9 mg/l are present in wastewater from the plants. Influent BOD5 of Grand Messa, Cite Verte and university campus wastewater range from 110 to 530 mgO2/l. Values recorded indicate an important input of organic matter to receiving waters. In the case of biotic components, test germs densities registered in the influent of Grand Messa and those of Cite Verte are comprised between 9 x 106 and 88 x 107 CFU/100 ml for fecal coliforms, and between 9 x 105 and 74 x 107 CFU/100 ml for fecal streptococci. The densities of Aeromonas hydrophila in Grand Messa and Cite Verte influent fluctuate between 30 x 106 and 65 x 108 CFU/100 ml. Influent of university campus harbour 10 x 105. Densities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa remain below 70 x 105 CFU/100 ml. Treated effluent BOD5 values range from 48 to 150 mgO2/l. Such values indicate an inefficient treatment. The decrease in bacterial densities is limited to 2 logarithmic units. Treated effluent still harbour 10 x 103 to 10 x 105 CFU/100 ml for fecal coliforms, and 20 x 102 to 12 x 104 CFU/100 ml for fecal streptococci. These values range from 10 x 104 to 50 x 105 CFU/100 ml for Aeromonas hydrophila. Pseudomonas aeruginosa densities remain in general below 40 x 104 CFU/100 ml. Discharges from these wastewater treatment plants are responsible for the permanent fecal contamination of the environment and a lack of proper hygiene. Furthermore, they produce overfertilization of receiving waters.\nHuan Jing Ke Xue. 2001 Mar;22(2):41-5. [Biodegradation behavior of ethylenediaminetetraethylene acid] Yang X, Jiang Z, Shi S, Guan Y, Deng J, Lu M. Dept. of Environ. Sci. and Eng., Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. Aerobic and anaerobic degradability of ethylenediaminetetraethylene acid(EDTA) were measured on Warburg respirometer and anaerobic batch reactors. Biodegradation of EDTA as a single substance was poor, but biodegradation of EDTA with co-substrate could be improved. The wastewater containing EDTA can be treated by activated sludge process. The EDTA removal efficiency was 80% under the circumstance HRT 16 h and EDTA removal efficiency reached to 92.5%-95.1% when HRT was 20 h. The main factor affecting the biodegradability of EDTA is sludge remained time.\nRocz Panstw Zakl Hig. 2001;52(1):19-24.

Pulaskiego Zaklad Technologii Garbarstwa. In this study we have investigated the influence of sludge on the activity of bacteria strains: Acinetobacter baumannii, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas cepacia. To our studies we have taken waste materials used in the chromium compound leather tanning process as well as materials from leather fat and waste materials, in general. It was confirmed that 1:20 dilution of chromium tanning leather waste, retanage and leather fat allowed the survivability of bacteria in all three strains. Through our research we were able to establish that general sewage with a decreased level of chromium practically did not effect the survivability of bacteria in a sewage environment. Both types of waste, city sewage as well as leather waste, were shown not to facilitate bacterial growth. If chromium waste flow into city sewage without treatment, bacteria can only survive at a dilution level of 1:20, which will not affect the survivability of bacteria used in biological waste treatment.\nRocz Panstw Zakl Hig. 2000;51(4):417-24.

Van Ommen Kloeke F, Geesey GG. Department of Microbiology and Center for Biofilm Engineering, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT 59717-3980, USA Abstract The majority of phosphatase (PO(4)ase) activity detected in fresh aerobic activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant was associated with suspended floc material. PO(4)ase activity appeared to be localized in discrete bacteria-containing areas of the floc matrix based on the distribution of nucleic acid-stained cells and precipitated fluorescent crystals produced as a result of reaction of the enzyme(s) with the artificial substrate ELFtrade mark-PO(4). Of the total floc-associated bacterial cells that stained positive with the nucleic acid-binding fluorochrome acridine orange (AO), 8.8 +/- 1.2% displayed PO(4)ase activity based on the proximity of AO-stained cells to precipitated ELF crystals. Using a 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probe specific for the cytophaga-flavobacteria group, it was determined that 17-20% of the floc-associated bacteria that probed positive also displayed PO(4)ase activity. Furthermore, 35-45% of the ELF fluorescence was associated with bacterial cells that probed positive for the cytophaga-flavobacteria group. The results suggest that the cytophaga-flavobacteria, as a group, is important in mediating the liberation of inorganic orthophosphate (P(i)) from phosphomonoesters of detrital organic phosphate (organic-P) in the aerobic activated sludge process of wastewater treatment.http://link.springer-ny.com/link/service/journals/00248/bibs/38n3p201.html</hea\nMicrob Ecol. 1998 Sep;36(2):111-20.\nEstimating the Growth Rate of a Bacterial Species in a Complex Mixture by Hybridization of Genomic DNA Pollard PC. The Advanced Wastewater Management Centre, Departments of Chemical Engineering and Microbiology, The University of Queensland, 4072 Australia > Abstract Advances in molecular techniques have enabled new approaches to identifying bacteria. However, once identified, there is no quantitative information on the in situ growth rate of the species, mainly because the technology has not been available. The quantitative incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into dividing bacteria is coupled with a molecular (hybridization) method, to determine the growth rate of bacterial species in situ. The basis of this molecular method is a reverse gene probe-natural populations are labeled in situ with [methyl-3H]thymidine. The probe (3H-Tdr-DNA) is captured, using a hybridization procedure, on a positively charged nylon membrane on which is attached non-labeled target DNA. Two bacterial species, Bacillus cereus and Zoogloea ramigera, were used to demonstrate the principle in laboratory cultures and in a municipal activate sludge treatment process. The DNA of the dividing bacteria in activated sludge was radioactively labeled with [methyl-3H]thymidine, and the DNA of Z. ramigera was recovered using a DNA hybridization method. The recovered radioactively-labeled DNA was used to estimate the growth rate (0.03 x 10(9) cells . ml-1 . h-1) of Z. ramigera in situ. Simultaneously applying these two powerful molecular-based methods could potentially be used to study bacterial population dynamics in situ.\nWei Sheng Wu Xue Bao. 1998 Apr;38(2):108-13. [Studies on reduction of hexavalent chromium by fungi] Wang B, Yang H, Li W. Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080. Several fungal strain, isolated from activated sludge, sewage and soil, were able to grow in the medium containing 300-500 mg/L K2Cr2O7, and strain BS-1 was capable of resistance to K2Cr2O7 up to 900 mg/L. After 4-6 d growing of the strain BS-1 and other 3 strains in the liquid medium added 200 mg/L K2Cr2O7, the Cr(VI) content of the medium disappeared completely. These strain were identified as Penicillium sp. BS-1, BS-3, Aspergillus niger BR-4, Aspergillus flavus BX-1 respectively. The results from the detection of the fungal culture by UV-absorbance spectrum and chemical analysis showed that high-toxic Cr(VI) was reduced to lesstoxic Cr(III). Reaction conditions and effectors of Cr(VI) reduction by intact cells of Penicillium sp. BS-1 were studied. The optimum temperature was 30 degrees C, the optimum pH was 7.0. Addition of glucose (0.25%) enhanced Cr(VI) reduction, but high concentrations of Cr(VI) inhibited the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III).\nMikrobiologiia. 1996 Sep-Oct;65(5):621-6. [Biotransformation of nitrogen-containing compounds in the process of the continuous final purification of effluents from swine-breeding farms by immobilized cells] [Article in Russian] Arkhipenko IA, Gusarova GA, Panikov NS. After their two-step purification in aeration tanks, effluents from a swine-breeding farm were subjected to final purification in a flow bioreactor with immobilized cells derived from activated sludge. The dynamics of nitrogen compounds were studied at the reactor inlet and outlet at three flow rates. The use of a simple mathematical model of the nitrogen balance allowed the rates of nitrogen assimilation-mineralization two nitrification stages, and nitrogen fixation-denitrification to be estimated. The first stage of nitrification was found to proceed intensely and produce high nitrite concentrations (up to 100 mg N/l, accounting for about half of the total N at the inlet). The second nitrification stage was inhibited, and nitrate was only produced after 3-4 weeks of continuous operation. The strategy of the final purification of effluents from nitrogen compounds is discussed on the basis of the known regulatory mechanisms of microbial activities in activated sludge.\nAppl Environ Microbiol. 1994 Mar;60(3):792-800.\nDevelopment of an rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe specific for the genus Acinetobacter and its application for in situ monitoring in activated sludge. Wagner M, Erhart R, Manz W, Amann R, Lemmer H, Wedi D, Schleifer KH. Lehrstuhl fur Mikrobiologie, Technische Universitat Munchen, Germany. Enhanced biological phosphate removal in an anaerobic-aerobic activated sludge system has generally been ascribed to members of the genus Acinetobacter. A genus-specific 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe was developed to investigate the role of Acinetobacter spp. in situ. Nonisotopic dot blot hybridization to 66 reference strains, including the seven described Acinetobacter spp., demonstrated the expected probe specificity. Fluorescent derivatives were used for in situ monitoring of Acinetobacter spp. in the anaerobic and aerobic compartments of a sewage treatment plant with enhanced biological phosphate removal. Microbial community structures were further analyzed with oligonucleotide probes specific for the alpha, beta, or gamma subclasses of the class Proteobacteria, for the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster, for gram-positive bacteria with a high G + C DNA content, and for all bacteria. Total cell counts were determined by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. In both the anaerobic and the aerobic basins, the activated sludge samples were dominated by members of the class Proteobacteria belonging to the beta subclass and by gram-positive bacteria with a high G + C DNA content. Acinetobacter spp. constituted less than 10% of all bacteria. For both basins, the microbial community structures determined with molecular techniques were compared with the compositions of the heterotrophic saprophytic microbiota determined with agar plating techniques. Isolates on nutrient-rich medium were classified by whole-cell hybridization with rRNA-targeted probes and fatty acid analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nRev Latinoam Microbiol. 1993 Jul-Sep;35(3):281-8.

From an activated sludge sample, microorganisms capable to degrade monomethylamine (MMA), dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine (TMA), and dimethylformamide (DMF) were isolated. These compounds are present in the wastewaters from a petrochemical plant. Microbial communities were cultivated, in aerobic conditions in a 2-liter bioreactor fed with the wastewater. Only four different kinds of microorganisms were obtained, but they could maintain their degradative capacity after several transfers. This microbial biomass was able to reduce 90% of the dissolved pollutants in a sample of industrial wastewater, mainly MMA, DMA, TMA, and DMF, measured as dissolved organic carbon, in approximately 5 days.\nAppl Environ Microbiol. 1993 Apr;59(4):1220-7.\nDegradation of poly(3-hydroxyoctanoic acid) [P(3HO)] by bacteria: purification and properties of a P(3HO) depolymerase from Pseudomonas fluorescens GK13. Schirmer A, Jendrossek D, Schlegel HG. Institut fur Mikrobiologie, Georg-August-Universitat Gottingen, Germany. Twenty-five gram-negative bacteria and one gram-positive bacterium capable of growing on poly(3-hydroxyoctanoic acid) [P(3HO)] as the sole source of carbon and energy were isolated from various soils, lake water, and activated sludge. Most of the isolates degraded only P(3HO) and copolymers of medium-chain-length (MCL) hydroxyalkanoic acids (HA). Except for the gram-positive strain, which was able to hydrolyze P(3HO) and poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) [P(3HB)], no isolate was able to degrade polymers of short-chain-length HA, such as P(3HB) or poly(3-hydroxyvalerate) [P(3HV)]. All strains utilized a large variety of monomeric substrates for growth. All gram-negative strains, but not the gram-positive strain, accumulated poly(hydroxyalkanoic acids) (PHA), consisting of MCL HA, if they were cultivated under accumulation conditions. One strain, which was identified as Pseudomonas fluorescens GK13 (biovar V), was selected and the extracellular P(3HO) depolymerase of this strain was purified from the culture medium of P(3HO)-grown cells by chromatography with Octyl-Sepharose CL4B and by gel filtration with Superose 12. The relative molecular weights of the native and sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated enzymes were 48,000 and 25,000, respectively. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed P(3HO), copolymers of MCL HA, and para-nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids. P(3HB), P(3HV), and characteristic substrates for lipases, such as Tween 80 or triolein, were not hydrolyzed. The P(3HO) depolymerase of P. fluorescens GK13 was insensitive to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and dithioerythritol, unlike other PHA depolymerases. The dimeric ester of 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid was identified as the main product of enzymatic hydrolysis of P(3HO).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nNitrogen and phosphorus can be growth limiting if not present in sufficient amounts in influent wastewater, a problem with industrial wastes and not domestic wastes. In general, a BOD5:N:P weight ratio in the wastewater of 100:5:1 is needed for complete BOD removal. Other nutrients such as iron or sulfur have been reported as limiting to activated sludge, but this is not common. Signs of nutrient deficiency include: filamentous bulking (see Table 1); a viscous activated sludge which exhibits significant exopolysaccharide (\"slime\") when \"stained\" with India ink; and foam on the aeration basin which contains exopolysaccharide (which has surface active properties). One check for nutrient deficiency is to be sure that at least 1.0 mg/L total inorganic nitrogen (TIN = ammonia + nitrite + nitrate) and 0.5-1.0 mg/L ortho-phosphorus remains in the effluent at all times. In systems treating mixed domestic and industrial wastes, only TIN and ortho-phosphorus should be used to calculate nutrient availability. Organically combined nitrogen and phosphorus (Kjeldahl nitrogen and total phosphorus) may not be hydrolyzed fast enough by the microorganisms in the activated sludge to keep pace with BOD use. b , h , k , a , e . After the wastewater and biomass have been aerated for a sufficient period to allow the soluble BOD to be incorporated into the cells of the biomass, the mixture flows to the final, or secondary settling tanks. Since these tanks are not aerated or agitated, the biomass is allowed to settle. The remaining effluent, which by this point in the process appears quite clear, is ready to be disinfected and discharged to the Hackensack River. The settled biomass is either reintroduced into a contact tank to serve as the inoculum for the process, or is wasted.\nAppl Environ Microbiol. 1992 Oct;58(10):3380-6.\nExpression and transfer of engineered catabolic pathways harbored by Pseudomonas spp. introduced into activated sludge microcosms. Nusslein K, Maris D, Timmis K, Dwyer DF. National Research Center for Biotechnology, Department of Microbiology, Braunschweig, Germany. Two genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs), Pseudomonas sp. strain B13 FR1(pFRC20P) (FR120) and Pseudomonas putida KT2440(pWWO-EB62) (EB62), were introduced into activated sludge microcosms that had the level of aeration, nutrient makeup, and microbial community structure of activated sludge reactors. FR120 contains an experimentally assembled ortho cleavage route for simultaneous degradation of 3-chlorobenzoate (3CB) and 4-methyl benzoate (4MB); EB62 contains a derivative TOL plasmid-encoded degradative pathway for toluene experimentally evolved so that it additionally processes 4-ethyl benzoate (4EB). Experiments assessed survival of the GEMs, their ability to degrade target substrates, and lateral transfer of plasmid-encoded recombinant DNA. GEMs added at initial densities of 10(6) to 10(7) bacteria per ml of activated sludge declined to stable population densities of 10(4) to 10(5) bacteria per ml. FR120 degraded combinations of 3CB and 4MB (1 mM each) following 3 days of adaptation in the microcosms. Indigenous microorganisms required an 8-day adaptation period before degradation of 4MB was observed; 3CB was degraded only after the concentration of 4MB was much reduced. The indigenous microbial community was killed when both compounds were present at concentrations of 4.0 mM. However, in parallel microcosms containing FR120, the microbial community maintained a normal density of viable cells. Indigenous microbes readily degraded 4EB (2 mM), and EB62 did not significantly increase the observed rate of degradation. In filter matings, transfer of pFRC20P, which specifies mobilization but not transfer functions, from FR120 to P. putida UWC1 was not detectable (< 10(-7) transconjugants per donor cell).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nArch Inst Pasteur Tunis. 1992 Jul-Oct;69(3-4):273-82.

Bacterial contamination of raw and treated wastewaters has been studied for 15 purification plants. Results have permitted the evaluation of bacterial effectiveness of different treatment modes. Best elimination rates of indicators (faecal contamination test-germs) were obtained by extensive treatments. Aerated lagoons were not usually more efficient than natural ones. Oxidation ditches were classified after stabilization ponds with a bacterial reduction of 2 log units. Biofiltration seemed to have the same effectiveness than activated sludge which were slightly more efficient at low-charge. Global elimination of Faecal contamination test germs by conventional intensive treatments is 1-2 log units.\nMikrobiologiia. 1992 Jul-Aug;61(4):709-16.

Pathways of the degradation of the main compounds of (meth)acrylate-producing factories wastewater (methyl methacrylate, methyl and butyl acrylate, acrylate and methacrylate, acetone, isopropanol, butanol and methanol) by the anaerobic microbial consortium of mesophilic unadapted granulated sludge from the \"UASB\" reactor and of adapted activated sludge from the contact reactor were comparatively studied. It was shown that the degradation of fatty acids and alcohols took place in both types of sludge. Methacrylate, acrylate and acetone degradation occurred only in adapted sludge. Both types of sludge were characterized by the reversible conversion of acetone and isopropanol and by the presence of the isomeric transition of butyrate and isobutyrate too. The present results allow to suggest that the adaptation of activated sludge to substrate includes the accumulation of biomass of microorganisms capable of hydrolyze specific substrates into such general intermediates as low-molecular-weight fatty acid and alcohols further metabolized to methane and carbon dioxide.\nAntibiot Khimioter. 1991 Dec;36(12):6-8.

The dynamics of Salmonella organisms in raw sewage treatment plants was studied over a period from July 1987 to August 1989. An experiment where Salmonella ser.

The results are as follows. 1) A number of strains of Salmonella could be isolated usually from samples drawn from raw sewage influent and up to the activated sludge stage of sewage processing. 2) After Salmonella ser. Havana NAr was introduced into raw sewage, the number of the organisms decreased in the activated sludge process to 1/1000 and the organisms were not found in the treatment plants after about forty days. 3) These results suggest that Salmonellas are adsorbed to activated sludge or other sludges, and are not discharged into rivers from this treatment plant. 4) The possibility of being able to determine the strain of Salmonella in regional epidemics by serovars of Salmonella detected in raw sewage treatment plants was suggested.\nZentralbl Mikrobiol. 1991;146(1):17-23.

Campylobacters were isolated from 28.6% of the sewage sludge samples of grit tank and primary settling tank. 40% of the settled activated sludge samples contained Campylobacter. Campylobacter was never found in digested sludge of a mean sludge age of more than 90 days. The survival times of Campylobacter in sewage sludge samples ranged between some hours and 10 days. Therefore a low risk of the spread of Campylobacter in the environment due to agricultural application of digested sewage sludge is assumed.\nArch Tierernahr. 1990 Jul;40(7):569-82.

Precaecal N-absorption was calculated with the help of the quotient [formula: see text] the blood plasma and the digesta The following values (in %) were registered in comparison to true N-digestibility (in the following in brackets): casein = 95.8 (99.2), whole egg = 92.1 (97.5), fish meal = 85.8 (93.4), dried skimmed milk = 98.4 (96.1), soybean meal = 79.6 (90.6), assay protein = 94.2 (98.9), wheat = 92.9 (90.7), barley = 84.3 (84.8), yeast, grown on molasses = 85.6 (87.2), yeast, grown on whey = 86.1 (88.5), biomass of liquid manure = 43.6 (68.9), activated sludge = 54.4 (64.1).

Fecal coliforms were isolated from the inlet, the primary sedimentation tank, the activated sludge digestion tank, the final settling tank, the outlet and the return activated sludge drain at the municipal wastewater plant in Ube City, and examined for drug resistance and presence of R plasmids. Drug concentrations employed to distinguish resistant isolates from sensitive isolates were 25 micrograms/ml for tetracycline, kanamycin, chloramphenicol and streptomycin, 50 micrograms/ml for ampicillin, nalidixic acid and rifampicin, and 200 micrograms/ml for sulfisoxazole, respectively. Of a total of 900 isolates, 45.7% were drug resistant and 51.1% of them carried R plasmids. The further along that wastewater had progressed through the treatment process the greater the tendency was for appearance of the multiresistant isolates. These isolates also were shown to simultaneously carry transferable R plasmids. Observed resistant patterns of R plasmids were mainly multiple and encoded to resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin and sulfisoxazole. It became clear that multiplication of R plasmids took place in the activated sludge digestion tank. This study show that drug resistance transfer mediated by these R plasmids may occur in actual wastewater treatment plants.\nZentralbl Hyg Umweltmed. 1990 Feb;189(4):285-99.

During a long term investigation (October 1986 October 1987) Yersinia spp. were isolated from sewage in 5 different stages of a sewage treatment plant in Kiel (Bulk), Schleswig-Holstein, FRG. Methods applied were MPN-procedure, cold enrichment in CIN-broth and finally incubation on CIN-agar (Cefsulodin-Irgasan-Novobiocin). Yersinia enterocolitica were specified according to their serotypes (O:3/O:9) and biotypes. Results (median/100 ml): sewage influent 90,000 KbE (log 4.95), aerated grit removal tank effluent 14.285 KbE (log 4.15), primary sedimentation tank effluent 20.000 KbE (log 4.30), activated sludge tank effluent 6.000 KbE (log 3.77) and final clarification effluent 260 KbE (log 2.41). After the final clarification a reduction of 99.72% was achieved. A general influence of the outward conditions (water temperature, proportion of oxygen, fecal and total coliforms, water flow, pH) on the behaviour on the Yersinia spp. could not be confirmed. The specification of the 644 germs isolated during the year showed an average proportion of 48.44% Yersinia frederiksenii, 29.5% Yersinia enterocolitica biotype 1, 18.94% Yersinia enterocolitica biotype 2, 2.8% Yersinia intermedia and 0.32% Yersinia kristensenii.

At Italian-Russian International Conference on \"Role of the University on ecological education and training\", was illustrate six topics of 30 years of our scientific and didactic activity on Environmental Hygiene, here below summarized: I. At first time, sludges of biological treatment plants and domestic sewage were frequently utilized under bacteriological control as economical and ecological fertilizers of land and waters. At present such a custom is very rare owing the chemical pollution of sewage continuously increasing; but in some countries it is still in use, and is our opinion and experience that organic waste material must be reused as fertilizer of land, more and more devoid of humus and subject to erosion of winds and waters. Some treatment plants are shown, and related plankton pyramid's. II. Pilot sewage treatment plants are frequently used in our experiments and training, for study and control of the biological degradation of organic matter, for evaluate the disappearance rate of bacteria and viruses, for investigate the foric action and behaviour of chemical and radioactive pollutants, for quantify their accumulation in the sludges of sewage treatment plants, and so forth. Different pilot plants are used, located both in our laboratories both in industries; in nuclear power plant are tested at the same time 3 models of 3 different plants (biodiscs, activated sludges, biofiltering channels), working with prevalent algal growth. III.\nWasting the biomass, which is now designated as secondary sludge, refers to the removal of this material from the treatment process for final disposal. The wasted secondary sludge is pumped to the gravity thickener tanks and/or thickening centrifuge. There exist several methods of chemical addition to enhance activated sludge settling. Most used are synthetic, high molecular weight, cationic polymers alone or in combination with an anionic polymer that serve to overcome the physical effects of filaments on sludge settling. These are usually added to the MLSS as it leaves the aeration basin or to the secondary clarifier centerwell. Use of polymer does not significantly increase waste sludge production but can be quite expensive, up to $450. per million gallons treated. A polymer supply company should be consulted for selection of a polymer. Jar testing should be performed at your plant to determine the type of polymer needed and its dosage, which are quite plant specific. In some instances, inorganic coagulants/precipitants such as lime or ferric chloride can be beneficial. These produce a voluminous precipitate that sweeps down the activated sludge, improving settling. g , d , i , j , c . Sludge production may be significantly increased if these are used. The weighting action of inert biological solids has also been used to aid sludge settling in activated sludge modifications such as the Hatfield or Kraus processes that recirculate anaerobic digester contents through the aeration basin. Clay and fiber addition have been used by some industries (e.g. papermills) to help sludge settling on a short-term basis.\nMany species of microorganisms (metazoa, protozoa, algae, fungi, bacteria, viruses and new species like Bdellovibrio) are present in aerobic sewage treatment plants (activated sludge, bacterial bed, biodiscs, lagooning, etc.); in anaerobic treatment (digesters) prevail only methane-producing bacteria. Some of these organisms are very abundant and very active as consumers of organic matter; others are characteristic indicators of well balanced purification or of bad purification owing acute variation of organic load or presence of toxic substances in sewage. Many strains are antibiotic-producing, or Vit. B12 producing; others explain a strong lytic activity or are neuraminidase-formers. Production of great amount of biofloculant polysaccharides useful on sedimentation of organic matter is enhanced by adding particular organic pollutants like distillery wastes and others. Sewage treatment plants are good means for scientific research of particular biota continuously available and for food microbiological training for students and technicians on pathogens present in treated and untreated sewage and in sludges. IV. Big fecal pollution of coastal waters is clearly dangerous because of bathing beaches, shellfish farming, bacterial aerosols, damage to marine biota, eutrofication, aesthetic problems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) Publication Types: Congresses\nAnn Ig. 1989 May-Aug;1(3-4):481-93. [Hygiene problems associated with characteristics of the sludge from purification plants in Liguria] [Article in Italian] Kanitz S, Rizzetto R, Patrone V, Franco Y, La Rocca MC, Roveta M, Parodi F, Pasero V. Sludge samples from five municipal sewage treatment plants in Liguria (Italy) were examined periodically during a whole year. Four of them are located in Genova and receive the sewage corresponding respectively to 20,000-53,000-125,000 and 285,000 equivalent inhabitants. The last one is in Chiavari and receives the sewage corresponding to 40,000 equivalent inhabitants. All plants included a preliminary screening treatment, primary sedimentation and a secondary activated sludge process. Sludge was thickened by centrifuge. The bacteriological and chemical characteristics of the sludge after centrifuging (detection and estimation of total and fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci and enumeration and isolation of Salmonella, pH, moisture, total and volatile residue, nitrogen, phosphorus, heavy metals) were measured in order to establish the possibility of land disposal. Dry solids contained on average 34 g/kg total nitrogen and 1,4 g/kg phosphorus. Among heavy metals copper and zinc reached high levels: 544 and 1587 mg/kg of dry solids. Other metals were present at lower concentrations (As 6, Cd 2, Cr 70, Hg 2, Ni 53, pb 416 mg/kg). Comparing these results with those of a research carried out contemporarily in another region (Emilia Romagna) it was observed that in Ligury there is a higher content of copper and bacteria (with an average of 69 Salmonella in 1 g of dry solids). The results showed that sludge produced in the five treatment plants in Ligury (Italy) was apt to be used as fertilizer in soil, but that care has to be taken for what concerns microbial contamination. For what regards the differences among the five sewage treatment plants under observation some heavy metals (arsenic and chromium) reached very high average levels (10-14 mg/kg of arsenic and 70-118 mg/kg of chromium) in the sludge of two of them, which treat the sewage from highly industrialized areas. On the contrary lead and cadmium were present at the same levels in all plants (416 mg/kg of lead and 2 mg/kg of cadmium) with the exception of one (Ge-Quinto) where cadmium was practically absent (0,2 mg/kg). The overall average concentrations of heavy metals resulted definitively lower than maximum concentration proposed by CEE (1986) and by some italian region as Lombardia. Some differences among plants for what regards microbiological parameters were noted only for total coliforms.\nZentralbl Hyg Umweltmed. 1989 May;188(1-2):66-83.

Many problems arise with the TEM preparation of activated sludge flocs because the specimen material contains up to 98% of water. It is difficult to preserve the ultrastructure beyond dehydration and to make the polymers visible, which cannot be visualized with standard methods. The method presented here renders satisfying results. The important role of the exocellular polymers for the structure, size and density of flocs can be well illustrated. Furthermore many structure patterns could be found differing largely from each other but occurring regularly as structure elements.\nAntibiot Khimioter. 1989 Feb;34(2):138-42.

[Liquid hospital waste] [Article in Italian] Fara GM, Collina D. Hospital sewage is distinct both from that of industrial origin and that from human housing, and is unique from the qualitative and quantitative standpoints. In fact the hospital is clearly different from a residential setting for the addition of technological activities, which are realised inside it, and it is not comparable to a traditional productive complex, because of the extreme variability--from one hospital to the other--of the presence of activities themselves, and this means important quali--quantitative differences of sewage produced from case to case. After all, the hospital cannot be compared to a centre of tertiary activities, which has, as regards sewage, the characteristics and the constancy of great inhabited places. Actually, its daily amount per patient is up to 1,000 L (3-5 times more than a standard citizen), because hospitals include, besides patients, physicians, nurses, technical and clerical staff and, for \"teaching hospitals\", also professors and students; in addition, the sewage from hospitals is composed of standard human sewage, plus: discharges from laboratories and technical equipments; drugs and their metabolites; disinfectants; and microorganisms, which are often characterized by the presence of antibiotic resistance of \"infectious\" nature (i.e. transmitted by resistance plasmids). Such contaminants are not evenly generated, but focal points in the hospital and given hours during the day can help to identify where and when most of each contaminant is produced. A special problem arises from the interference of contaminants in hospital sewage on activated sludge plants; another is connected with the presence of toxic substances originated from biochemical laboratories, but the concentration of such substances appears to be lower than that tolerated according to the italian regulations.\nSchriftenr Ver Wasser Boden Lufthyg. 1989;80:209-30.

[Quantitative studies of the elimination of coliphages and other fecal indicators during wastewater treatment] [Article in German] Zaiss U, Hennies HH. Labor fur Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Fachrichtung Versorgungstechnik, Fachhochschule Braunschweig-Wolfenbutte. Concentrations of coliphages, coliforms, enterococci and fluorescent Pseudomonas were monitored in several wastewater purification steps of the treatment plant Wolfenbuttel during one year. Their number varied widely during the investigation period, but was independent of seasons. In the course of sewage treatment, including primary settling, activated sludge purification, simultaneous precipitation, trickling filters and oxidation pond, the concentration of indicators decreased gradually. The coliphages were most resistant, exhibiting only a decimal elimination value of 1.7 log10 units as compared to the bacterial indicators with elimination values ranging between 2.4 and 2.8 log10 units in the whole process. The most efficient purification step revealed to be the activated sludge procedure including simultaneous phosphate precipitation with iron hydroxides and sedimentation. On an average 1.7% of the coliphages present in raw sewage or 9.8.10.11 phages were discharged into the river Oker everyday, 0.64% remained in the sludge. Numbers of indicators in the water of the oxidation pond and those seeded into river water were continuously reduced during 3 days. Also in these laboratory experiments, the coliphages were more resistant than the bacteria, but no evidence was found to support the view that coliphages play a role in the reduction of the number of coliform bacteria. Even after addition of peptone which stimulated growth of E. coli the coliphages were inactivated more rapidly. The behaviour of coliphages during the purification process is compared with literature data about enteroviruses.\nZentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg [B]. 1988 Jun;186(3):205-19.

The behaviour of 39 PCB-isomers will be tested in a model sewage plant. Their distribution is described mathematically and the quantities of the partial streams are calculated. Because there is no loss of PCB through the ventilation of the activated sludge tank and according to the isomeric mass balance, it can be concluded that the less chlorinated PCB are decomposed microbially while all of the higher chlorinated PCB are found in the sludge and the effluent of the model plant.\nSchriftenr Ver Wasser Boden Lufthyg. 1988;78:267-76. Fate of genetically-engineered bacteria in activated sludge microcosms. Dwyer DF, Hooper SW, Rojo F, Timmis KN. The conclusions that can be derived from this study regarding the fate of the GEMs and their ability to degrade added pollutants are as follows: 1. Both GEMs were able to survive in the microcoms. Because Pseudomonas sp. B13 has been cultured for a long time in the laboratory, it was not expected to survive well in the microcosm. Surprisingly, it and the derivative GEMs persisted at a high population level of approximately 10(5) bacteria/ml. Pure culture studies had demonstrated an ability of FR1(pFRC20P) to readily degrade simultaneous mixtures of 3CB and 4MB. In the microcosms, however, the GEM did not perform as well as expected, particularly when confronted with a shock load of a 3CB and 4MB mixture. Thus, the microcosm studies may be of potential help for making predictions concerning environmental applications of GEMs. 2. Pseudomonas sp. B13 derivative strains FR1 and FR1(pFRC20P) were able to degrade low concentrations of substituted benzoates within the complex ecosystem of the activated sludge microcosm. A good deal of information concerning the degradation pathway for aromatics by Pseudomonas sp. B13 was already known.\nBecause of the high BOD loads that remain in the wastewater following primary treatment, further treatment must be provided before the effluent may be discharged to the Hackensack River. The BCUA employs a biological treatment system known as the activated sludge process to achieve secondary treatment. During this process, the wastewater flows into an aerated and agitated tank containing a complex mixture of bacteria, fungi, protozoans, and other microorganisms which are referred to collectively as the biomass. The dissolved and suspended organic matter in the wastewater serves as a food source for the biomass which the organisms use to grow and reproduce. Sufficient air must be provided to supply the biomass with the oxygen necessary for respiration. If too little air is introduced into the aeration tanks, the biomass will use anaerobic respiration to metabolize the organic matter, producing foul odors and poor effluent quality. g , k , c , c , l . The BCUA introduces air into the process tanks using one or two of its five 45,000 cfm capacity blowers. The BCUA uses a variation of the activated sludge process known as contact stabilization. In the first step of this process, the wastewater is brought into contact with the biomass for a short period of time, in which the biomass absorbs the soluble BOD. The biomass is then settled and introduced into a stabilization tank where it is aerated for a longer period of time. In this step, the organic material is fully oxidized and the volume of the biomass increases.\nThis allowed for the construction of the stable, regulated pathways for the degradation of substituted aromatic compounds in both GEMs and indicates that the construction of similar GEMs for the degradation of environmental pollutants is a promising experimental strategy. 3. There was not any demonstrable, adverse effect of GEM addition to the microbial population level in the microcosm. The GEMs were even able to function in a protective manner for the indigenous populations by buffering them against the adverse effects of addition of substituted benzoates. In contrast, for microcosms lacking GEM addition, a wash-out of the bacterial population in the microcosm occurred (data not shown). 4. Lateral transfer of new genetic information (xylXYZLS) from the GEM chromosome to indigenous microorganisms was not detected, whereas transfer of the hybrid, mobilizable pFRC20P carrying the gene for lactone isomerase did apparently occur. In this particular case, transfer may have been beneficial for the community as a whole if it increased the ecosystem's ability to cope with the presence of toxic pollutants. As more GEMs are constructed for specific biotechnological applications the diversity and complexity of microcosms used to study their fate and function will increase. The ability of such studies to predict a priori the fate of these microorganisms will help to develop strategies both to decrease the risks associated with introducing GEMs into the environment and to increase and regulate the capacity of GEMs to degrade toxic pollutants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) Publication Types: Review Review, Tutorial\nZentralbl Mikrobiol. 1988;143(6):415-23.

In activated sludge processes the colony counts increased, whereas total coliforms did not show significant differences between raw sewage and activated sludge processes. With regard to the antibiotics tetracycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin and gentamicin raw sewage samples contained on average 10(3) antibiotic resistant coliforms/ml. From agar plates supplemented with antibiotics a total of 896 strains were characterized. Single resistant E. coli strains (29.3%) were isolated most frequently from agar plates supplemented with tetracycline. However, coliforms isolated from agar plates which were supplemented with chloramphenicol, kanamycin and gentamicin showed a prevalent resistance to 5 and 6 antibiotics tested. The variety of resistance patterns of gentamicin-resistant coliforms was determined by few plasmids encoding gentamicin resistance only.\nZentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg [B]. 1987 Oct;185(1-2):171-82.

[Quantitative studies of the elimination of Salmonellae by biological wastewater treatment] [Article in German] Kayser R, Boll R, Muller HE. Institut fur Stadtbauwesen, Abteilung Siedlungswasserwirtschaft, Technischen Universitat Braunschweig. The wastewater pretreatment plant of Braunschweig works as a conventional, one step activated sludge plant without primary settling tanks. There were about 37,000 m3 per day of effluent during our investigations. During some months daily quantitative determinations of salmonellae were performed in the raw wastewater, in the activated sludge, and in the effluent. The mean concentrations of salmonellae were in the raw wastewater 2 X 10(5)/l and in the effluent after 11h of aeration and then settling 2 X 10(4) cells/l. The concentrations of salmonellae varied about the factor 10(3) (limits 10(2) to 10(5)). A small peak in the spring, a big peak in the late summer, and a week pattern were observed. The most salmonellae were adsorbed to unsoluble flocs of sludge, about 30-35% of the salmonellae only were found freely in the water and from that about 60% were concentrated round the flocs. Therefore, one step of settling removes about 90% of all salmonellae. In generally terms, the settling seems to be the most important step of removal of salmonellae from wastewater. Furthermore, the rate of removal is depending of the concentration. High concentrations of salmonellae cause a strong reduction and conversely. An immediate removal of salmonellae was observed in about 60%, however, there was a propagation of salmonellae in 30% of all samples, especially under conditions of low aeration, in an anaerobic environment, respectively.\nZentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg [B]. 1987 Jun;184(3-4):183-94. [Comparative studies of the kinetics of hygienically relevant microorganisms in activated sludge] [Article in German] Schomburg I, Muller HE. Staatliches Medizinaluntersuchungsamt Braunschweig. Several samples were taken regularly from 14 different activated sludge ponds in 11 municipal wastewater treatment plants (Table 1). During 7 days, the samples were supplied with oxygen continuously by stirring and the following parameters were determined daily in the filtrate and also in the insoluble sludge: total bacterial plate count grown at 36 degrees C; additionally the oxidase-positive bacteria; the gram-negative bacteria grown on MacConkey agar; also the lactose-positive bacteria of these; C. coli; aerobic endospore-forming bacteria; and protozoa. Furthermore, salmonellae were determined in some aerated and non-aerated samples. The sludge index (SI) as the quotient of volume and dry weight of sludge, in addition the optical density of the sludge-free filtrate was measured. The total bacterial plate count, the count of gram-negative rods, and the lactose-positive enterobacteria were found to be reduced in 12 of the 14 investigated series. The amount of E. coli diminished in as many as 13 of the 14 series and the oxidase-positive bacteria dropped in 11 of 13 cases. The concentration of aerobic spore-forming bacteria remained constant or increased. A propagation of salmonellae was observed only under anaerobic conditions in sludge (Fig. 4). An analysis of the bacterial dynamics shows that the propagation of all bacteria occurs mainly in the free water. Also the reduction of bacteria is more in the free water than in the insoluble flocs of sludge (Table 2). Hence it follows that the flocs are not the centres of microbial activity although most bacteria (medium 76%) are attached to them. Moreover, we found characteristic relations between SI and optical density of the filtrate for the different wastewater treatment plants. There is also a positive correlation between the frequency of protozoa in sludge and the SI (Fig. 2). The SI is correlated positively also with the reduction rate of the most groups of bacteria, excluding the aerobic spore-forming bacteria (Fig. 3). This fact shows a conflict of two possibilities. On the one hand, the reduction of bacteria in wastewater is being improved by increasing SI but the deposition of such sludge is poor. On the other hand, sludge with a lower SI is settling better but the removal of bacteria by protozoa is diminished. Altogether, the sedimentation of flocs is the most important step of elimination of fecal bacteria from wastewater. The process reduces the concentration by the factor 10. Therefore, the successive sedimentation of raw sewage and activated sludge is about 10 time more effective than the simultaneous sedimentation.\nAnn Inst Pasteur Microbiol. 1986 Sep-Oct;137B(2):219-26.

The most contaminated effluent of rectification columns is isolated from the general plant discharge and subjected to local treatment. The advisability and level of the local treatment in electrochemical sewage treatment were studied under laboratory conditions. At the current density of 220 A/m2, the process time of 10 min at pH 6.0 and the ratio of the local effluent to the general plant discharge of 1:30 the level of the sewage treatment was the following: 45-50 per cent by the chemical demand of oxygen and 50-60 per cent by the biological demand of oxygen in 5 days. The residual content of active chlorine did not exceed 14 mg/l. It was shown experimentally that during the sewage treatment there formed no compounds toxic for the activated sludge microorganisms.\nZentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg [B]. 1986 Apr;182(2):216-36. [Emission of microorganisms from sewage treatment plants depending upon construction differences of single structural parts] [Article in German] Eikmann T, Schroder S, Pieler J, Bahr H, Einbrodt HJ. In order to examine the influence exerted by the differing design of individual water treatment plant units on the emission rate of micro-organisms and the associated degree of exposure to which plant personnel is subjected, measurements were taken at three different types of treatment plants. Measurements were made using \"Biotest\" RCS Air Samplers. The total count of colonies was determined by means of Agar Strips GK-A (tryptic soy agar). Enterobacteriaceae were quantitatively ascertained using Agar Strips C (MacConkey agar), particular attention being paid to the determination of the coliform bacteria as faeces indicators. Agar Strips S (mannitol salt agar) were used to measure the count of staphylococci using Agar Strips HS (rosa Bengal streptomycin agar). Before taking measurements, the prevailing climatic conditions were recorded. It could be ascertained that the enclosure of the inflow area (screw conveyor pump station and aerated grit removal tank) lead to a considerable increase in the concentration of microorganisms in the air within the housing. The values dropped however, when adequate ventilation was provided. Differing oxygen in the activated sludge tanks - finebubble aeration at the tank bottom or the blowing in of air via centrifugal blowers - lead to large variations in the emission rates. However, the less the waste water is agitated, the lower the emission rates. In the case of fine-bubble aeration, rates which are also normally to be found in the \"non-burdened\" outside air were even recorded close to the aeration tank. In cases of centrifugal blower, the aeration tank should be covered with a shield. With this type of aeration the waste water is emitted radially towards the walls of the tank. The use of a sprinkler unit on an aeration tank equipped with centrifugal blower - to avoid foam formation on the surface of the water - does not lead to an increase in the already high emission rate. An increase in air pollution through mould fungi from waste water treatment plants could not be found. In conclusion, it can be said that different individual plant unit designs have a large influence on the concentration of micro-organisms in the ambient air of places of work of waste water treatment plant personnel. Emission rates can be limited to such a degree that, even in the immediate vicinity of the plant units, a decrease of micro-organism concentrations can be attained as comparable to the area outside the treatment plant.\nZentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg [B]. 1986 Apr;182(2):143-54. [Various Salmonella serotypes isolated at a sewage purification plant in a large city over a one-year period] [Article in German] Sobotta B, Schusseler G, Gerhardt GG, Teitge E, Gundermann KO. The paper offers the results of a one-year-survey of Salmonella-serotypes in a municipal sewage-purification plant with a capacity of roughly 70,000 m3 per day. Findings of a quantitative study had shown Salmonella-maxima in the activated-sludge-basin. This suggested specialized Salmonella-serotypes, resident in this part of the plant as a possible explanation which was to be verified by this study. On ten days samples were taken from the inlet, and the outlet of the primary-sedimentation-tank, the outlet of the activated-sludge-basin and the effluent of the final sedimentation-basin. A combination of membrane-filtration and MPN-Method with a fifefold enrichment in 2.5% tetrathionate was applied for salmonella isolation. Plating was done on malachit-green-chinablue-lactose-agar followed by serological typing. 1,587 strains representing 38 different serotypes (Table 1) were identified with S. typhi-murium (Fig. 1) accounting for 36% of the isolations followed by S. bovis-morbificans, S. hadar (Fig. 2) and S. panama. None of the serotypes found showed a preference of a special sampling point. The qualitative and quantitative distribution of Salmonella in the plant seems to depend on the Salmonella contents of the entering waste water mainly. The greatest variety of Salmonella-serotypes was located in the activated-sludge-basin (Table 2) where oxygen-enrichment seems to result in the best ecological conditions for Salmonella survival. 3.3% of 722 strains examined did not produce hydrogen-sulphide (Table 3) and some showed damaged flagella-antigens. As a possible explanation toxic influences in the sewage are discussed. The epidemiological links between findings of Salmonella in sewage and in man of the same area are established and results differing in some aspects explained by the high rate of unknown infections. The existence of an autochthonous Salmonella-population in the sewage plant could not be proved.\nZentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg [B]. 1986 Apr;182(2):131-42.

S. typhi-murium was found most frequently (Table 1, Fig. 1). The largest spectrum of different types was located in the activated sludge-basin and at the outlet of the chemical flocculation (Table 2). No correlation could be established between the qualitative findings and the Salmonella-counts or other parameter like temperatures. All the ten species that have been officially reported to cause salmonellosis in man were also isolated from the sewage (Table 5). Findings of other Salmonella-serotypes are attributed to unreported human infections and animals or other sources.\nZentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg [B]. 1985 Jun;181(1-2):37-51. [Microflora in swine slurry as a parameter in determining the efficiency of deodorizing treatment. I. Continuous and discontinuous aeration treatment] [Article in German] Hennlich W. Liquid manure from the pig, fresh and stored, was treated by continuous and discontinuous aeration. The purpose was to achieve a biologically stabilized and deodorized organic material. The samples which were aerated intermittently had good decomposition rates for nitrogen compounds and even so good deodorization effects. In spite of a minimum of dissolved oxygen of appr. 0.2 mg/l, good deodorization could be achieved by intermittent aeration for 23 days. Simultaneous processes of nitrification and denitrification were observed in optimal aerated manure similar to activated sludge processes. On the other hand, significant shifts on the microflora could be shown, whereby the main part of the biota consists in the gramnegative, non fermentative organisms. In non-deodorized liquid manure, members of the genus Bacillus advanced in their growth rates. In addition to Alcaligenes-Pseudomonas organisms, the group of nonfermentative cocci (e. g. Moraxella spp., Paracoccus spp.) dominated. Their growth development during the treatment agreed very well with the results of decomposition and deodorization. The existence of Bifidobacterium and of Aerococcus in aerated pig slurry was not ascribed before.\nZ Gesamte Hyg. 1985 Apr;31(4):237-41.

In feeding experiments with pigs and fish (carp and trout) the test animals received quotas of activated sludge of 7.5 and 15% DM (pigs) and 20% (carp) in their mixed feed. In an experiment with trout in an aquarium the quota of activated sludge was increased from 20% to 50%. The benzo(a)pyrene content was ascertained in selected organs of the pigs (kidney, liver, bacon, muscles) and the edible parts of the fish. As a result of this experiment one can say that the feeding of activated sludge from pig manure does not result in an increased benzo(a)pyrene content in the tested organs of the pigs and the edible parts of the fish.\nZentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg [B]. 1984 Jun;179(3):259-65. [Occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in waste water and its behavior under biological treatment] [Article in German] Geuenich HH, Muller HE. 103 days long, the concentration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined in 206 samples of raw wastewater and of the activated sludge after the biological step in the wastewater pretreatment plant of Braunschweig. 2594 strains of P. aeruginosa were isolated, 95.8% of them showed production of pyocyanin. The concentration of P. aeruginosa varied between 2.6 X 10(1) and 4.8 X 10(4) cells/ml. Neglecting some exceptions, there were about ten times more P. aeruginosa in the sludge than in the clearly filtered wastewater and about one hundred times more than in the clearly filtered effluent. In general, P. aeruginosa seem not to be reduced by the biological oxidation during the wastewater treatment. On the contrary, we observed a multiplication in 69% of all cases. The multiplication of P. aeruginosa during the biological oxidation is discussed. Finally, the hygienic role of sludge is discussed because P. aeruginosa are concentrated herein.\nRev Mal Respir. 1984;1(2):125-31. [Atmospheric and respiratory contamination by waste water aerosols] Boutin P, Moline J, Torre M, Boissinot E. A study was undertaken of the particle size of aerosols, emitted by a treatment plant for urban waste water, by counting the total flora, using and Andersen apparatus. Evidence of significant bacterial contamination was obtained on the perimeter of the installations. Calculations were made on the data obtained using a method to show the number of viable particles deposited at different levels within the pulmonary tree. During the working day approximately 10(4) viable particles, representing 1.5 x 10(6) organisms, products of the common flora of activated sludge were inhaled. Only a small fraction enters the pulmonary acini; the greater part are swallowed or excreted via the nose or on coughing.\nZentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg [B]. 1983 Sep;177(6):482-9. [Comparative study on methods to recover indigenous viruses from samples of activated sewage sludge] [Article in German] Wullenweber M, Joret JC. Samples of activated sewage sludge were investigated for their contents of indigenous enteric viruses. Therefore sewage sludge solids were collected by centrifugation and the embedded viruses eluted by blending (Waring blendor), glycine buffer (0.05 M) treatment at pH 11.5 or Freon1 treatment. Eluted viruses were concentrated on microfiberglass filters (\"Balston\" filters) at pH 3.5 or by flocculation with beef extract (3%, pH 3.5). Simple blending of the activated sludge was found being not very efficient, while the other two methods gave better results in freeing the viruses from the sewage flocs. Usually highest virus titers were obtained after glycine treatment and concentration with Balston filters. Freon treatment of activated sewage sludge produces aqueous supernatants containing much denaturated floc material which seems to cause a certain number of viruses to remain in the supernatant after flocculation.\nZentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg [B]. 1983 Jun;177(5):436-50. [Filamentous bacteria in activated sludge (bulking sludge). I. Occurrence of filamentous bacteria in a sewage treatment plant working with the activated sludge process (plug flow system)] [Article in German] Emmrich M, Ziegler M, Ruden H. The occurrence of filamentous bacteria in activated sludge (bulking sludge) was investigated in the sewage treatment plant Berlin-Ruhleben. The studies were carried out in five periods from 26.10.1981 to 29.7.1982 (= 112 sampling days). It was noticed that filamentous bacteria appeared in the aeration tanks in different quantities and several kinds of species. With the identification key from Eikelboom Microthrix parvicella, Type 021 N and Type 0041 were frequently identified in all aeration tanks, whereas Type 0961 and Nocardia spec. were observed only in several aeration tanks. Haliscomenobacter hydrossis, Thiothrix spec., Type 0914, Type 1701, Type 1851 and Type 1852 appeared only sporadically. Besides the familiar filamentous bacteria another species was identified under the microscope which, however, could not be classified so far. The filaments are straight or slightly bent with a visible septation and long cylindrical cells. The species is Gram- and Neisser-negative and shows no deposition of sulfur granules.\nMikrobiologiia. 1983 Jan-Feb;52(1):149-55. [Activity of microorganisms in activated sludge in relation to the concentration of mercury in sewage] [Article in Russian] Ilialetdinov AN, Mendeshev A, Manasbaeva AB, Banovska OV, Beliakova VA. Activated sludge from the refinery of a plant producing synthetic rubber was shown to adsorb mercury ions contained in the sewage. As a result, the content of microorganisms in the sludge as well as the activity of dehydrogenase decreased. The quantity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells was 40 x 10(6) per 1 ml in a chemically defined medium without mercury ions, 20 x 10(5) per 1 ml in the water after the first sedimentation tank (0.07 to 0.08 mg Hg per litre), and 10 x 10(6) per 1 ml in the water of sewage common to the whole plant (0.13 to 0.14 mg Hg per litre). The use of the phage-resistant P-aeruginosa T-76 culture adapted to synthetic organic pollutants contained in the sewage of the plant together with the activated sludge of the refinery increased the biological activity of the sludge and improved the quality of purification in terms of dehydrogenase activity and chemical uptake of oxygen.\nNuovi Ann Ig Microbiol. 1982 Mar-Jun;33(2-3):301-21.

[Properties of the obligate methylotroph Methylophilus methanolovorus] [Article in Russian] Loginova NV, Trotsenko IuA. A strain of obligate methylotrophic bacteria utilizing methanol as a sole source of carbon and energy was isolated from the activated sludge. The bacteria are strictly aerobic Gram-negative non-pigmented motile rods with a single polar flagellum. They do not form spores or capsules and have no complex intracytoplasmic membranes. They do not require vitamins and assimilate methanol via the hexulose phosphate pathway. The G+C content of DNA is 51.0 +/- 0.5 mole%. The optimal temperature is 30-38 degrees C, the optimal pH is 6.8-7.4. The obligate dependence on C1-substrates but not on methane, as well as the absence of complex intracytoplasmic membranes, makes it possible to assign such methylotrophs to the genus Methylophilus nov. gen. The description of the new genus and species M. methanolovorus nov. gen., nov. sp. is presented.\nAnn Microbiol (Paris). 1980 Mar-Apr;131A(2):209-17.

[Influence of different sampling systems on evaluation of bacteriological and virological performance for an activated-sludge treatment plant (author's transl)] Hugues B, Bouron Y, Plissier M, Andre M. Various quantitative evaluations of the performance of an activated-sludge treatment plant for viruses and bacteria removal and ameliorating physicochemical characteristics have been performed over a period of 24 hours, using successive and continuous samplings. The performance of the treatment plant evaluated using these two sampling systems shows no difference with the one obtained from punctual sampling. In every case, one can observe at the discharge a reduction amounting to 1 or 2 log. for the bacterial density and from 1/2 to 2 log. for the viral charge. Statistical study shows that whatever the sampling method used - punctual or successive and continuous over 24 hours - there is no fundamental difference between values of viral and bacterial densities. This comparison can only be established if a previous study has been made to determine the most representative hour to effect the punctual sampling.\nMikrobiologiia. 1979 Sep-Oct;48(5):785-92.

A strain of budding bacteria capable of autotrophic growth in the atmosphere of H2+O2+CO2 or in a medium with methanol was isolated from activated sludge. The cells are Gram negative nonmotile yellow pleomorphic rods which do not form rosettes. The bacterium is a strict aerobe. It utilizes a wide range of organic compounds (alcohols, sugars and organic acids) as the sources of carbon and energy. The G+C content of DNA is 66.3 +/- 0.9 mol %.

[Microbial contamination of air by activated sludge units (author's transl)] [Article in German] Wanner HU. Measurements of the germ emissions in various activated sludge units with different ventilations systems have shown that the lowest density occurs with small bubble ventilation; with medium bubble and brush ventilation rather high values were measured; the spray devices used for foam elimination had a particularly unfavorable influence. In great germ densities above the pools (50-100 000 germs/m3) - depending on the weather - between 500 and 1500 germs/m3 were measured at a distance of 50 and 100 meters. At distances of 200 and 400 m the number of germs was about the same as normally measured in the outside air (100-500 germs/m3). In a closed pool altogether considerably higher values were measured: In the immediate neighbourhood of the activated sludge unit they amounted to abt. 10 000-25 000 germs/m3; in the hall 3000-4000 germs/m3 were measured, whereby the part of coliform bacteria amounted to 1-2% and that of enterococci to 2-4%. It has to be taken into account that besides the measured intestinal flora further pathogenous agents are present in the aerosols. In closed units, therefore, a greater risk of aerogenous infections exists, whereas in open-air pools this danger can be judged as very small.\nPrikl Biokhim Mikrobiol. 1975 May-Jun;11(3):367-73. [Metabolism of monocarbon compounds during biological purification of sewage waters] [Article in Russian] Makeeva EN, Makeev AM, Rodziller ID. Pathways and rates of metabolism of three 14C1-compounds (methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid) were investigated by means of the heterogeneous population of activated sludge microorganisms. For the above microbial population formaldehyde was the primary or preferential substrate. During an hour aeration it was processed by activated sludge 6 times faster than by sodium formiate and 2 times faster than by methanol. The basic pathways of its transformation were oxidation via formiate to CO2 with its partial reutilization and direct incorporation into the sludge biomass via the primary formation of serine. An addition of methanol increased the incorporation of 14C-formadehyde into biomass and decreased the formation of free 14CO2. The main mechanism of the transformation of 14C-formiate in activated sludge was its oxidation to CO2. An addition of methanol and formaldehyde induced no essential changes in the rate or pattern of their metabolism.\nScientific Publications - Work Done by Microbiology Reader\nBioscreen C\n"}, {"score": 570.6083, "uuid": "a3411e22-187c-5846-90d1-3ab9fc32b627", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1500wb-15-02816", "target_hostname": "www.cleantick.com", "target_uri": "http://www.cleantick.com/topic/biopolymers-and-bioplastics", "page_rank": 1.2005446e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Biopolymers <em>and</em> Bioplastics latest updates | Cleantick - Catalyzing Cleantech", "snippet": "- Cathode ray tubes used in television <em>and</em> computer monitors is really hazardous? o Electronic <em>waste</em> recycling act? - <em>what</em> <em>are</em> <em>the</em> pros <em>and</em> cons of this act? o Hazards of ewaste? - If electronic products not disposed properly,will it affects our environment?", "explanation": null, "document": "From the data that I have been through new plastics have been discovered till 1980 after that applications were looked into.\nPlease correct me if I am wrong.Thank you.\n0 person added this post to their reference\nNarsi 7 months ago\nHi! Thought I would provide some inputs on what's the latest in biodegradable plastics: 1. Rapidly-Biodegradable Hydrophobic Material - RBHM (New Approach to Biodegradable Products) - \"We have patented and developed cellulose-based rapid biodegradable hydrophobic material (RBHM). RBHM is a new, hydrophobic, strong, cheap recyclable, repulpable and completely biodegradable composite material of newly type that is environmentally friendly. RBHM has shown great promise in improving the properties of both paper and plastics packaging aterials. Due to its recycle and biodegradable nature, Rapid Biodegradable Hydrophobic Material is ideal to be applied for the disposable grocery bags and packages. The material can be used as a commodity in trade, industry and agriculture for a wide range of applications. Today, most attempts to produce biodegradable products for consumers focused on developing plastics that could biodegrade. RBHM approaches biodegradable products from the other direction: making cellulose-based material with the same physical properties as plastic, except the material is recyclable and completely biodegradable in the same time as regular paper bags. RBHM consists of cellulose (paper) and biodegradable organic additives.\" - http://figovsky.borfig.com/genius.aspx 2. Biodegradable Plastic Made From Wood By-product - \"Ground-Breaking Invention May Replace Conventional Plastic- Arboform, an innovative liquid wood material invented by a German scientist, may completely eliminate the need for energy-intensive plastic products in the future. The ground-breaking invention uses an otherwise useless element of actual wood, lignin, which is then combined with natural resins, flax and fibers. The end product can be infused into molds to form intricate, precision-shaped objects usually made with environmentally hazardous petroleum-based plastics\" - http://www.renewable-energy-news.info/biodegradable-plastic-made-from-wood/ 3. Improving Biodegradable Plastics Manufactured from Corn - Biodegradable plastics made from polylactic-acid-based polymers (PLA) derived from plants could provide the solution. In manufacturing, PLAs consume much less energy than plastics using petroleum-based feedstocks, and they decompose much faster than do petroleum-based plastics. However, PLA products lacked resistance to higher temperatures; for example, a hot-beverage drinking cup would distort when filled with a hot liquid. In addition, PLA plastic parts were expensive to manufacture, partly due to the additives necessary to improve the hardening time and other properties of the plastic resin used to make the products. Cargill, Inc. was an agriculture company that had been researching plant-derived plastics. They proposed to improve plastics made of corn-based PLA by making them easier to manufacture and more heat resistant. Their comprehensive research approach required advances in polymer blends, additives, and manufacturing techniques and involved high technical risk, so the company needed outside funding. In 1994, Cargill applied for and received Advanced Technology Program (ATP) funding for a three-year project that started in 1995. With ATP funding, Cargill reduced the hardening time for products made from PLA. Dow Chemical provided expertise in plastics manufacturing - http://statusreports.atp.nist.gov/reports/94-01-0173.htm 4. Novel Feedstock for Biodegradable Plastic - An unusual polysaccharide has been identified that can be extruded as a biodegradable plastic. Unique properties allow it to replace certain petroleum-based plastics at the same price as other bioplastics. To gain quick acceptance, details of the process developed during the Phase I project will be published. Revenues will be obtained from sales of the polysaccharide. As the volume of polysaccharide sales increases, the price will further decrease. Plastic manufacturers will not need to change equipment; the change will be in the raw materials. Environmental regulations, problems with plastic disposal, and increases in the price of oil are concerns for the $375 billion plastics industry. For many, production of a \u201cgreen\u201d plastic would provide a competitive edge and open new markets. Preliminary work has shown that it is possible to extrude this polymer into a plastic that will dissolve in water in less than 12 hours. An innovative formulation will make a second product resistant to water for 12 hours but still soluble in less than 1 week. The solubilized plastic is degraded easily into sugar monomers, which can be used as an energy source by numerous microorganisms. Derived from an agricultural product and safe for both users and the environment, this polysaccharide reduces pollution throughout its life cycle. - http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract/7952/report/0\n"}, {"score": 569.0928, "uuid": "60a8d121-71bd-57a4-a110-e08cd68416bb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1514wb-27-23866", "target_hostname": "ecocycle.org", "target_uri": "http://ecocycle.org/microplasticsincompost/faqs", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "Microplastics in Compost FAQs", "snippet": "&gt; <em>What</em> is <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> degradable <em>and</em> <em>biodegradable</em> products? &gt; Isn\u2019t it okay to put <em>biodegradable</em> materials in a landfill? &gt; Should I stop eating seafood because it\u2019s contaminated by plastic? &gt; Which single-use products <em>are</em> compostable?", "explanation": null, "document": "> What is the best choice for serving food and beverages?\nWhat are plastic-coated paper products?\nPlastic-coated paper products are a common type of food packaging made from paper and coated with plastic to prevent liquid absorption or freezer burn, or to otherwise enhance product performance. Almost all plastic-coated paper products are coated by an impregnation process with low-density polyethylene (LDPE). This and other petroleum-based coatings used for these applications do not biodegrade. These products include milk and juice cartons, hot and cold paper drinking cups, frozen food containers, plastic-lined paper bags, take-out containers and some paper plates.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between macro- and micro-plastics?\nMacro-plastics have been defined as being greater than or equal to 5mm and micro-plastics have been defined as less than 1mm. For practical purposes in a composting process, macro-plastics can be defined as those that can be screened out and micro-plastics as those that pass through the screening process.\nMacro-plastic particles are introduced into the composting process from a variety of products such as plastic bags, plastic-coated paper products, diapers and other contaminants. These particles are larger than \u00bd inch in size and are generally removed from the composting process during screening. They do, however, add to the cost of processing compostable materials.\nMicro-plastic particles are smaller than \u00bd inch in size, and may be as small as 100 microns (a micron is one-millionth of a meter). Because of their small size, micro-plastic particles are not removed by the compost screening process and contaminate the finished compost. Eco-Cycle and Woods End research found all plastic-coated paper products tested were shedding micro-plastic particles into the compost during decomposition.\nWhy aren\u2019t plastics removed from compost during the screening process?\nMost composters use a \u00bd inch (12 mm) sieve to screen contaminants from their finished compost. This removes many common plastic contaminants such as plastic bags. Under dry conditions, a 3/8 inch (9 mm) sieve may be used. Particles smaller than the sieve size, such as micro-plastics, are not removed through the screening process and will contaminate the finished compost.\nBack to Top\nWhat guidelines do you recommend for composting facilities for accepting foodservice products and packaging?\nOnly certified tested products\u2014using ASTM 6400 , EN 13432 or the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) standards\u2014should be allowed in food waste collection programs. No other plastic-coated paper products should be accepted. Soiled paper products, such as tissues, paper napkins and paper towels, are suitable for composting. Paper products such as cardboard, office paper, shredded paper and uncoated paperboard do biodegrade but recycling these materials should be given highest priority. Milk and juice cartons should be recovered through recycling facilities.\nThe City of Seattle's guidelines (right) and Eco-Cycle's guidelines for Boulder County are good examples of programs that exclude plastic-coated paper products that are not certified compostable.\nShould I stop using compost?\nNo! Compost is an excellent soil amendment with numerous benefits:\nSuppresses plant diseases and pests\nReduces or eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers\nPromotes higher yields of agricultural crops\nImproves soil structure (tilth) which improves water holding capacity and erosion control, and improves drainage and permeability by keeping aeration channels open\nBuffers soil acidity\nFacilitates reforestation, wetlands restoration, and habitat revitalization efforts by amending contaminated, compacted and marginal soils\nCost-effectively remediates soils contaminated by hazardous waste\nRemoves solids, oil, grease, and heavy metals from storm water runoff\nCaptures and destroys 99.6% of industrial volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) in contaminated air\nOffers stronger protection against changing climate conditions.\nHowever, it is imperative we deploy best management practices to the growing number of compost collection programs in the U.S. and Canada in order to maintain the integrity of our compost and ultimately our soils. Learn more about the benefits of composting at www.cool2012.com .\nShould I stop composting?\nNo! Composting your food scraps and yard debris returns valuable nutrients to our soils and keeps organic materials out of landfills. Landfills are a top source of methane, a greenhouse gas 72 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Landfills can also contaminate groundwater and contribute to local air pollution. By composting in your backyard or through a curbside composting program, you\u2019re part of a win-win solution for our environment, our climate and our communities.\nBack to Top\nHow can I tell if a paper product is coated with a petroleum-based plastic?\nThere is no fail-safe method for determining whether a paper product is coated with petroleum-based plastic. There are far more manufacturers using polyethylene (PE) coating on paper products than a compostable PLA coating and these PE-coated products are much more readily available. While most PE-coated paper products are not marketed as compostable, they are accepted by many composting programs, or they may have misleading marketing claims such as \u201cbiodegradable\u201d or \u201cearth-friendly.\u201d Only products that meet ASTM 6400 , EN 13432 or BPI standards can be safely composted.\nCan I compost pizza boxes and paper towels?\nYes, pizza boxes, paper towels, tissues and paper napkins are safe for composting. These products, often referred to as \u201csoiled paper,\u201d are made entirely of paper fibers and can be composted in a home compost bin or through a curbside composting program. (Frozen pizza or other frozen food boxes and hand or surface wipes are not compostable.)\nCan I recycle plastic-coated paper products?\nMilk cartons and juice boxes can be recycled through many recycling programs across the U.S. and efforts are underway to expand these recycling options to all communities. To find out if these materials can be recycled in your local recycling program or to learn more about adding these materials to your recycling program, visit www.aseptic.org/cartons.html.\nOther plastic-coated paper products, such as paper cups, take-out food packaging and frozen food boxes, cannot be recycled. The same plastic coating that inhibits the decomposition process also makes these products difficult to recycle. The paper fibers cannot be separated from the plastic coating so these materials are a contaminant in the recycling bin.\nBack to Top\nWhat are oxo-biodegradable products and are they safe?\nOxo-biodegradable products are petroleum-based plastic products that are designed to disintegrate when exposed to heat and oxygen. These products are commonly used for plastic foam items, plastic carryout bags, film plastics and agricultural mulch films. These products do not meet composting standards and should not be included in composting programs. The environmental benefits of these products, as well as their ability to degrade or biodegrade, are all under debate. A series of recent tests by Woods End and Mother Earth News calls into question how well these bags actually fragment; after exposure to several months of hot, arid conditions, no fragmentation occurred. It is also under debate whether or not the fragmented plastics are eventually taken up by micro-organisms to be biodegraded, or if they remain in the environment.\nWhat is the difference between degradable and biodegradable products?\nConsumers often assume that a product labeled degradable is actually biodegradable.This is not the case. A degradable product disintegrates into smaller pieces when exposed to environmental conditions. It is not broken down completely unless it is biodegradable, and therefore, it will add to the growing problem of plastic pollution in the environment. Something that is truly biodegradable can be completely consumed or decomposed by living organisms, becoming beneficial to the environment.\nBeware of products that claim to biodegrade in 1 to 5 years.These claims are debated and any product that does not biodegrade in the normal 90 day cycle at a compost facility can do harm when released into an ecosystem. In addition, products made with a mix of non-biodegradable plastic and a compostable material (such as plant starch) should be avoided because the plastic fragments will remain after the compostable component decomposes.\nIsn\u2019t it okay to put biodegradable materials in a landfill?\nThe landfilling of organic materials such as food scraps, yard debris, paper products and compostable plastics produces methane, a greenhouse gas 72 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Landfills also produce a liquid leachate that can seep out and contaminate groundwater, and volatile organic compounds and other toxic substances that contribute to local air pollution. By composting our organic materials instead, we can replenish our soils with valuable nutrients, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs.\nBack to Top\nShould I stop eating seafood because it\u2019s contaminated by plastic?\nThere are no official advisories against eating seafood because of the presence of plastic particles in our oceans and marine life.\nWhich single-use products are compostable? When purchasing products, which labels should I look for and what questions should I ask?\nOnly products that meet ASTM 6400 , EN 13432 or BPI standards can be safely composted in a commercial-scale compost facility.Look for these labels or use the BPI website to find companies with compostable products. Avoid products that say \u201cbiodegradable\u201d or \u201ccompostable\u201d without any reference to a measurable standard.\nWe've pulled together a comprehensive list of BPI certified products , as well as some explanations of the different products and choices , to help you make the right decisions.\nWhat is the best choice for serving food and beverages?\nDurable, reusable tableware is the best choice for our environment and the most efficient use of our natural resources. For larger events or gatherings, you can rent these materials from event/party rental companies, or pick up your own supply cheaply at a secondhand store.\n"}, {"score": 569.04944, "uuid": "625a3e9a-8e12-57b5-afdf-896e17da5d67", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1516wb-54-00072", "target_hostname": "ecocycle.org", "target_uri": "https://ecocycle.org/microplasticsincompost/faqs", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "Microplastics in Compost FAQs", "snippet": "&gt; <em>What</em> is <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> degradable <em>and</em> <em>biodegradable</em> products? &gt; Isn\u2019t it okay to put <em>biodegradable</em> materials in a landfill? &gt; Should I stop eating seafood because it\u2019s contaminated by plastic? &gt; Which single-use products <em>are</em> compostable?", "explanation": null, "document": "> What is the best choice for serving food and beverages?\nWhat are plastic-coated paper products?\nPlastic-coated paper products are a common type of food packaging made from paper and coated with plastic to prevent liquid absorption or freezer burn, or to otherwise enhance product performance.

Eco-Cycle and Woods End research found all plastic-coated paper products tested were shedding micro-plastic particles into the compost during decomposition.\nWhy aren\u2019t plastics removed from compost during the screening process?\nMost composters use a \u00bd inch (12 mm) sieve to screen contaminants from their finished compost. This removes many common plastic contaminants such as plastic bags. Under dry conditions, a 3/8 inch (9 mm) sieve may be used. Particles smaller than the sieve size, such as micro-plastics, are not removed through the screening process and will contaminate the finished compost.\nBack to Top\nWhat guidelines do you recommend for composting facilities for accepting foodservice products and packaging?\nOnly certified tested products\u2014using ASTM 6400 , EN 13432 or the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) standards\u2014should be allowed in food waste collection programs. No other plastic-coated paper products should be accepted. Soiled paper products, such as tissues, paper napkins and paper towels, are suitable for composting. Paper products such as cardboard, office paper, shredded paper and uncoated paperboard do biodegrade but recycling these materials should be given highest priority. Milk and juice cartons should be recovered through recycling facilities.\nThe City of Seattle's guidelines (right) and Eco-Cycle's guidelines for Boulder County are good examples of programs that exclude plastic-coated paper products that are not certified compostable.\nShould I stop using compost?\nNo! Compost is an excellent soil amendment with numerous benefits:\nSuppresses plant diseases and pests\nReduces or eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers\nPromotes higher yields of agricultural crops\nImproves soil structure (tilth) which improves water holding capacity and erosion control, and improves drainage and permeability by keeping aeration channels open\nBuffers soil acidity\nFacilitates reforestation, wetlands restoration, and habitat revitalization efforts by amending contaminated, compacted and marginal soils\nCost-effectively remediates soils contaminated by hazardous waste\nRemoves solids, oil, grease, and heavy metals from storm water runoff\nCaptures and destroys 99.6% of industrial volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) in contaminated air\nOffers stronger protection against changing climate conditions.\nHowever, it is imperative we deploy best management practices to the growing number of compost collection programs in the U.S. and Canada in order to maintain the integrity of our compost and ultimately our soils. Learn more about the benefits of composting at www.cool2012.com .\nShould I stop composting?\nNo! Composting your food scraps and yard debris returns valuable nutrients to our soils and keeps organic materials out of landfills. Landfills are a top source of methane, a greenhouse gas 72 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Landfills can also contaminate groundwater and contribute to local air pollution. By composting in your backyard or through a curbside composting program, you\u2019re part of a win-win solution for our environment, our climate and our communities.\nBack to Top\nHow can I tell if a paper product is coated with a petroleum-based plastic?\nThere is no fail-safe method for determining whether a paper product is coated with petroleum-based plastic. There are far more manufacturers using polyethylene (PE) coating on paper products than a compostable PLA coating and these PE-coated products are much more readily available. While most PE-coated paper products are not marketed as compostable, they are accepted by many composting programs, or they may have misleading marketing claims such as \u201cbiodegradable\u201d or \u201cearth-friendly.\u201d Only products that meet ASTM 6400 , EN 13432 or BPI standards can be safely composted.\nCan I compost pizza boxes and paper towels?\nYes, pizza boxes, paper towels, tissues and paper napkins are safe for composting. These products, often referred to as \u201csoiled paper,\u201d are made entirely of paper fibers and can be composted in a home compost bin or through a curbside composting program. (Frozen pizza or other frozen food boxes and hand or surface wipes are not compostable.)\nCan I recycle plastic-coated paper products?\nMilk cartons and juice boxes can be recycled through many recycling programs across the U.S. and efforts are underway to expand these recycling options to all communities. To find out if these materials can be recycled in your local recycling program or to learn more about adding these materials to your recycling program, visit www.aseptic.org/cartons.html.\nOther plastic-coated paper products, such as paper cups, take-out food packaging and frozen food boxes, cannot be recycled. The same plastic coating that inhibits the decomposition process also makes these products difficult to recycle. The paper fibers cannot be separated from the plastic coating so these materials are a contaminant in the recycling bin.\nBack to Top\nWhat are oxo-biodegradable products and are they safe?\nOxo-biodegradable products are petroleum-based plastic products that are designed to disintegrate when exposed to heat and oxygen. These products are commonly used for plastic foam items, plastic carryout bags, film plastics and agricultural mulch films. These products do not meet composting standards and should not be included in composting programs. The environmental benefits of these products, as well as their ability to degrade or biodegrade, are all under debate. A series of recent tests by Woods End and Mother Earth News calls into question how well these bags actually fragment; after exposure to several months of hot, arid conditions, no fragmentation occurred. It is also under debate whether or not the fragmented plastics are eventually taken up by micro-organisms to be biodegraded, or if they remain in the environment.\nWhat is the difference between degradable and biodegradable products?\nConsumers often assume that a product labeled degradable is actually biodegradable.This is not the case. A degradable product disintegrates into smaller pieces when exposed to environmental conditions. It is not broken down completely unless it is biodegradable, and therefore, it will add to the growing problem of plastic pollution in the environment. Something that is truly biodegradable can be completely consumed or decomposed by living organisms, becoming beneficial to the environment.\nBeware of products that claim to biodegrade in 1 to 5 years.These claims are debated and any product that does not biodegrade in the normal 90 day cycle at a compost facility can do harm when released into an ecosystem. In addition, products made with a mix of non-biodegradable plastic and a compostable material (such as plant starch) should be avoided because the plastic fragments will remain after the compostable component decomposes.\nIsn\u2019t it okay to put biodegradable materials in a landfill?\nThe landfilling of organic materials such as food scraps, yard debris, paper products and compostable plastics produces methane, a greenhouse gas 72 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Landfills also produce a liquid leachate that can seep out and contaminate groundwater, and volatile organic compounds and other toxic substances that contribute to local air pollution. By composting our organic materials instead, we can replenish our soils with valuable nutrients, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs.\nBack to Top\nShould I stop eating seafood because it\u2019s contaminated by plastic?\nThere are no official advisories against eating seafood because of the presence of plastic particles in our oceans and marine life.\nWhich single-use products are compostable? When purchasing products, which labels should I look for and what questions should I ask?\nOnly products that meet ASTM 6400 , EN 13432 or BPI standards can be safely composted in a commercial-scale compost facility.Look for these labels or use the BPI website to find companies with compostable products. Avoid products that say \u201cbiodegradable\u201d or \u201ccompostable\u201d without any reference to a measurable standard.\nWe've pulled together a comprehensive list of BPI certified products , as well as some explanations of the different products and choices , to help you make the right decisions.\nWhat is the best choice for serving food and beverages?\nDurable, reusable tableware is the best choice for our environment and the most efficient use of our natural resources. For larger events or gatherings, you can rent these materials from event/party rental companies, or pick up your own supply cheaply at a secondhand store.\n"}, {"score": 564.7645, "uuid": "c7694bfc-0dd3-51a5-8e6e-10295bc9cf36", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1812wb-67-26028", "target_hostname": "www.charitychallenge.com", "target_uri": "http://www.charitychallenge.com/responsible-tourism-you.html", "page_rank": 1.3725774e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "responsible tourism - <em>what</em> you can do", "snippet": "If you <em>are</em> out for <em>the</em> day <em>and</em> no toilet is available please ask your challenge leader <em>what</em> <em>the</em> appropriate action is <em>and</em> ensure you don\u2019t leave any paper <em>waste</em> behind.

Participants are encouraged to enter into the spirit of adventure, but to do so with respect for the places and people you visit. For the truly responsible traveller this starts at home.\nremove all unnecessary packaging\nMany countries do not have the same refuse disposal systems as you are used to. A challenge can cause a\nsurprising amount of waste. We ask that you all do as much as possible to minimise this, and to see that rubbish is disposed of responsibly. Be particularly aware of the problems of disposing of batteries, if in doubt bring them home with you.\nread about the destination you are going to in advance\nKnowledge of the local culture and environmental issues will help you become a more sensitive traveller. See the Fact File for more information, and the reading list in the Q&A Sheet for your challenge.\nlearn a few words of the local language\nA few well-chosen words will go a long way. If you are able to communicate even at a very modest level you will feel more comfortable in the environment you are in and put your hosts at ease. Basic words are included in the Q&A sheet.\nraise money for a local charity\nIf you would like to take part in one of our challenges and would like to raise money for a local cause in the country that you are visiting, you can support one of the many UK or Irish registered charities who work\ninternationally. This way, the funds you raise will benefit the host country. Visit the Associated Charities section on our website and click through to the charities listed under International Aid.\nwhat you can do whilst on the challenge\nDuring the challenge is when you will have the biggest influence on the environment, so this is your chance to\nminimise the negative impact and to make it as positive as possible for all involved.\nbe conservative with water\nIn many places, water is a scarce resource and without careful use, local people and wildlife suffer. We always\nprovide a generous amount of clean drinking water on our challenges, so you do not need to continually buy bottles of water, which generates a huge number of plastic bottles which are often buried, as recycling facilities are not available. When cleaning your teeth turn the water tap off whilst you are brushing. Dirty water used from washing either yourself or dishes should be scattered on the ground 100ft away from river sources if a drain is not available. Do not use non biodegradable soap in lakes or streams.\ndon't leave rubbish behind\nPlease take it with you. Your rubbish is not often biodegradable, is always unsightly, and may take years to\nbiodegrade especially in desert or mountain environments. In some instances rubbish can cause great harm to\nwildlife. It may seem that local communities have little regard for their environment and contribute heavily to the problem of rubbish, but waste disposal is often very limited. Please don\u2019t let our presence add to these problems. Please carry your rubbish with you and dispose of it at the next camp or town you come to. Try and leave the area as you would want to find it, this may include picking up other people's rubbish at your camp site. Try to use the same water bottle without buying new ones each time yours has run out.\nsmoking\nIf you must smoke, you should collect the matches and cigarette butts when finished and put them in your pocket and dispose of them properly when you get to camp. Not only does it present a fire risk, cigarette butts take many years to decompose and may harm local wildlife.\nnoise\nNoise should be kept to a minimum so as not to disturb the animals, or any other game watchers. Animals should not be touched, goaded, fed or disturbed in any way. Don\u2019t try to approach animals as this may cause them to panic and injure themselves as they run away. On tours where animals are used for transportation we aim to ensure that animals are well looked after, are fed well and given realistic loads to carry\ndamage\nTry not to damage any plant life, which you come across. This includes not picking flowers, which might be rare.\nWhen trekking, follow your guides and keep to the path. Going off the beaten track could result in damaging\nsensitive soil and vegetation. Removing coral damages the marine ecosystem and is nearly always unsustainable. If you are near coral, please bear in mind it is made up of tiny animals and takes centuries to grow. Treading on coral can cause severe long-term damage.\ngifts\nIf you wish to take gifts of books or pens for use in schools, please ask your challenge leader how this can be done in a fair and responsible way. It may be possible to visit a school at some point in the challenge that Charity Challenge supports through client donations. Buying products made from endangered species threatens their existence. Remember, in most cases it is illegal to import into the UK products from elephant ivory, rhino horn, furs, endangered tree species, butterflies, orchids, cacti, coral, sea turtle products, snake skin and wild game meat. Similarly, when on the beach, don't buy shells because that encourages the seashell trade. Do not be tempted to buy ancient artifacts such as pottery, which possibly were stolen from graves or unexplored tombs etc. Be aware that some goods may be manufactured through child labour.\naccommodation\nMost challenges begin and end in a hotel. When you stay in at your hotel please turn off air conditioning and lights when you are not in the room. Also ask the challenge leader to talk to hoteliers about towel washing option and please use the towels more than once rather than asking for (or allowing) them to be washed every day.\ntoilets\nMany of our challenges will take you off-the-beaten track, there are often a lack of toilet facilities. On treks it is unlikely you will have a flushing toilet. Instead a toilet tent will be erected and a pit dug. The pit should be dug at least 30m away from any water sources, and any paper rubbish should be collected and burnt, not buried. If you are out for the day and no toilet is available please ask your challenge leader what the appropriate action is and ensure you don\u2019t leave any paper waste behind. Where a toilet is provided, please use it, as opposed to finding your own rock to crouch behind. Only if there is no risk of fire use toilet paper and burn it but ask the challenge leader first.. Toilet paper is unsightly and takes a long time to break down.\nsocial impact\nAs well as impacting upon the physical environment, tourism can have a huge and lasting impact on the people and culture of the country you are visiting. By following local guidelines and by being respectful of culture and traditions, you will gain as much out of the challenge as possible and hopefully leave behind a positive impression.\nyou may be confronted by extremes of wealth and poverty\nUnfortunately, beggars are a fact of life \u2013 some are genuine, others are trying to cash in on the tourist trail. Whether you give money or gifts is a personal matter. If you give anything to any local people, try not to be 'condescending', e.g. don't throw pens out of the vehicle to children as you pass a village. Don\u2019t give sweets to children. Although it may seem as though you are giving them a treat, many countries we visit have little or no dental care, and by giving sweets you are contributing to their tooth decay. It will also encourage children to beg and s ee tourists as little more than a source of sweets and treats. Don\u2019t show off your relative wealth, with displays of money and material goods such as camera equipment or jewellery. It\u2019s not only making you a potential target to be robbed but is also highlighting the poverty gap that may exist between yourselves and those in the host country.\ntipping\nTipping is perfectly acceptable and can form the base of the local economy, with some relying mainly on tips. Your challenge leader will advise you on tour when and how much is appropriate, and refer to your Q&As. Please feel free to take with you pens books, pencils etc but please give them to your challenge leader to distribute and not directly to children or communities you meet as this may build expectations and can create problems for future travellers.\nbargaining\nPrices are generally low due to low wages and poor working conditions. Only start to bargain if you intend to buy, as it\u2019s not fair to knowingly mislead a hardworking vendor. When bargaining for goods, please bear in mind that 10 cents is nothing to you, but might be a lot to the vendor. Always have a figure in mind that you think is fair to pay and don\u2019t feel aggrieved if you find the same product for less. Don\u2019t get angry or aggressive when bargaining remember the vendor is just trying to make a living, even though it may be at your expense.\nlocally made goods\nDo not buy endangered plants, animal skins, or anything made from cacti, coral, shells, starfish, ivory, fur or\nfeathers. We encourage you however to buy locally made goods and crafts and seek out shops or markets that\nwork as co-operatives. This means that a fair amount is paid to the producers and discourages mass-production. You may also be able to buy more unique goods and souvenirs. When in markets or busy areas, avoid public displays of wealth such as watches, rings, jewelry and ipods. The golden rule of traveling is if you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t take which is especially true for jewellery.\nrespect\nRespect local customs and follow high standards of courtesy. Treat images of the heads of state with respect. Be aware of the differences in social behaviour and behave appropriately. Standards of acceptable behaviour vary greatly from place to place, and people of developing countries can often be easily shocked by 'western' behaviour. Displays of intimacy are often considered not suitable in public. Don\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep. So if you say you are going to write, do. Learn some words in the local language to help make contact and conversation.\nphotography\nAsk permission before taking someone's photo. Many people don\u2019t like having their photo\u2019s taken and there may be religious reasons for this. Don\u2019t pay children for photos\u2019 as it will encourage them to beg. If they have the opportunity to go to school they may not to be so willing to do so if they can make money from tourists by looking cute. Be cautious when taking photos of bridges, official buildings, persons in uniform, planes and airports, or religious buildings and ceremonies. Ask your challenge leader for advice if unsure.\nphysical contact\nAcceptable physical contact and body language varies in different destinations. Knowing the social norms in the\ndestinations you are travelling through will help you to avoid embarrassing situations and enhance your chances of meeting the locals.\nlocal dress code\nObserve the local dress code in the areas in which you are travelling, e.g. cover up in holy places. Local people can feel deeply offended when visitors do not observe the dress code and this can also cause unwanted attention. Respect property and their surroundings. Leave places you visit as you found them, or even better. Ensure you know the appropriate behaviour for the situation you are in, for example, ask your tour leader if it is essential to remove your shoes before entering a building.\ntreat local staff with respect and humility\nNo matter what their role is on your challenge. We aim to ensure every person involved in the challenge has a fair wage and has the right to work in safe conditions. As members of the International Porter Protection Group (IPPG) that sets guidelines and working conditions for porters, we aim to ensure the porters we use are treated in an acceptable way and paid fairly. Visit the IPPG website for further details www.ippg.net about porters\u2019 rights and working conditions or talk to your challenge leader.\ndon\u2019t have any involvement with drugs or prostitution\nNot only are both illegal in most countries we visit, but the trade presents real dangers for the people involved,\nmany of whom are forced to do so against their will.\nwhat you can do post-challenge\nIf you promise to send photos back to someone please ensure you do so. This is an excellent way of sharing a\npositive interaction and many locals love to see themselves in print.\n"}, {"score": 562.1692, "uuid": "b9f959d5-aea7-584d-94d8-01c5bdb21f5f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1203wb-56-39990", "target_hostname": "www.rethinkrecycling.com", "target_uri": "http://www.rethinkrecycling.com/compostablebags", "page_rank": 2.0333735e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "Compostable Bag Requirements in Twin Cities Metro |", "snippet": "How can I tell <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> a compostable plastic bag <em>and</em> traditional black plastic bag? <em>What</em> is <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> &quot;oxo-<em>biodegradable</em>&quot; <em>and</em> &quot;compostable&quot;? Will <em>the</em> compostable bags start to breakdown if it rains or if they <em>are</em> stored for a long period of time?", "explanation": null, "document": "Green Tips Signup\nCompostable Bag Requirements in Twin Cities Metro\nEffective January 1, 2010, residents in the Twin Cities area who bag their yard and organic waste will be required to put their waste out for pickup in compostable bags - either paper (kraft) bags or compostable plastic bags. This will affect residents in the following counties: Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington. This is not a new requirement for Dakota County; they've been required to use compostable bags for years.\nUsing paper and compostable plastic bags rather than traditional black plastic bags will greatly reduce the amount of plastic being sent to local composting facilities. Because local composters will have less plastic to screen out of their finished compost, processing costs will be reduced and the quality of the finished compost will be enhanced. Lower processing costs at local composting facilities should reduce the costs for haulers of yard waste, which may lead to lower prices that residents pay for yard waste service.\nCompostable plastic bags are distinct from regular plastic bags because they are usually clear or a translucent shade of green or white. Most home improvement, grocery, and hardware stores now carry them. If you don't see them at your local store, ask an employee; many store owners are just learning of this requirement also and may appreciate the customer request.\nIf you prefer not to purchase these compostable bags, you could also contact your city recycling office or yard waste hauler to ask if there are yard carts available in your area. Other options include using paper kraft bags, dropping off your yard waste at a compost facility and taking your bag home with you, or composting your yard waste on your own property and using the nutrient-rich compost for your garden and lawn.\nTo read more about the science of compostable bags and to see a listing of some of the Minnesota retailers who carry compostable bags visit the Biodegradable Products Institute's website .\nFor more information on the new compostable plastic bag requirements and how they will affect you, read the frequently asked questions below. If you still have questions or comments, visit with us on our blog at RethinkRecycling.com/blog .\nWhat happens if I do not use a compostable bag?\n1. Who must use compostable bags and when?\nBeginning January 1, 2010, residents of Anoka, Carver, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington Counties who bag their yard waste or other compostable waste will be required to put their waste out for pick up in compostable bags - either paper bags or compostable plastic bags. Residents of Dakota County who bag their waste are already required to use compostable bags for yard waste pick up.\nThis requirement will not impact your service if you currently collect your yard waste or other compostable waste in a cart, or you take your yard waste to a collection facility and remove the waste from the bags yourself. Contact your local hauler or yard waste collection facility for specific details. You can also ask your hauler or city if there are yard carts available for resident use, or you can bring your yard waste to a yard waste collection facility yourself and remove the waste from any non-compostable bag.\u00a0 You can also start composting your own yard waste (see question 9 below).\n2. What is a compostable bag?\nCompostable bags include paper Kraft bags (large brown paper bags) or compostable plastic bags. Compostable plastic bags are usually clear or tinted a translucent shade of green, white, or pink; however the color is not the sure way of determining the compostibility of a plastic bag. Compostable plastic bags should clearly state that they meet ASTM D6400 standards for composting and that they are \"compostable\". Bags marked \"biodegradable\" or \"degradable\" do not meet the state law.\nThe shelf life of compostable bags is approximately 1 to 3 years. Make sure to review the label for the product specific shelf life and purchase accordingly.\n3. How can I tell the difference between a compostable plastic bag and traditional black plastic bag?\nLook for the word \"compostable\" on the box. The words \"lawn and leaf\" or \"yard waste\" do not guarantee that the bag is compostable and acceptable to use under the new rule. Visually, compostable plastic bags are usually clear or tinted a translucent shade of green, white, or pink, compared to traditional black plastic bags.\nThe Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI), provides an independent certification program for products that meet all requirements of the ASTM D6400 standard, which is the standard required by this new law.\u00a0 BPI uses independent approved labs and reviewers and is not based upon manufacturer's claims. The following logos for certified compostable plastic mean that the bag meets standards required under the law to be considered compostable and are acceptable under this new requirement:\n(USA)\n(Europe)\n4. What is the difference between \"oxo-biodegradable\" and \"compostable\"?\nOxo-biodegradable refers to a material that is made from plastic that, over time, will break down into smaller pieces of plastic but never fully degrade. Compostable materials, on the other hand, are made from plant-based materials and will completely biodegrade in a short period of time in a commercial composting operation. Oxo-biodegradable bags, often labeled \"degradable\" or \"biodegradable\" are not permitted under this new law. Only compostable bags are allowed.\n5. Will the compostable bags start to breakdown if it rains or if they are stored for a long period of time?\nThe technology used to make compostable bags has improved greatly. The first compostable bags made years ago did tend to break down when stored too long on a shelf or if they came in contact with any moisture. Today, we have much higher-quality bags that have longer shelf lives and can hold up better to outdoor conditions. You will likely notice a difference in brands, so if you don't like one type that you use, try another and it may work better.\n6. Why is using compostable bags important?\nOnce your yard waste or source separated compostable waste is picked up, it is delivered to a compost facility. Waste received at composting facilities in regular plastic bags must be debagged, which increases costs and the chance that plastic bags will be blowing around on site causing a safety hazard and litter problem. Some compost sites shred the bag and its contents and attempt to screen the torn pieces of plastics later. Unfortunately not all plastic shreds can be screened out, which reduces the value and quality of the finished compost.\n7. Where can I buy compostable bags?\nMost home improvement, grocery and hardware stores now carry compostable bags. If you don't see them at your local store, ask an employee. Many store owners are just learning of this requirement and may appreciate the customer request.\u00a0 The Biodegradable Products Institute maintains a listing of some of the Minnesota retailers who carry compostable bags.\nCompostable bags tend to cost slightly more than the traditional black plastic bags here in Minnesota; however, given the new demand, prices may decrease over time.\n8. When do I have to use compostable bags?\nCompostable bags are required for use with curbside yard waste and compost collection (unless you use a cart from your hauler). So any yard waste, food waste, organics, or other compostable material must be placed in a compostable or kraft bag, or in a cart when collected at the curb.\n9. What are the benefits of using compost?\nBenefits of using compost include:\n\u2022 Saving natural resources;\n\u2022 Reducing soil erosion;\n\u2022 Preventing polluted storm water runoff from contaminating our wetlands, lakes, and streams; and\n\u2022 Providing a valuable soil amendment product that can be used to enrich the soils of our community.\nYou can read more about composting on our yard waste page .\n10. What happens if I do not use a compostable bag?\nIf you do not use a compostable bag, kraft bag or a cart from your hauler for yard waste or other compostable waste, your hauler will not collect your waste. If your yard waste is left at the curb for pick-up in a black plastic bag they will not collect it. Compost drop-off sites will also require the material to be removed from non-compostable bags and you will be required to take the bag with you.\nTranslate\n"}, {"score": 561.1421, "uuid": "62f126c8-30f2-514a-ae93-2706dc8b2fe6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0806wb-43-11630", "target_hostname": "cfpub1.epa.gov", "target_uri": "http://cfpub1.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.researchCategory/rc_id/846", "page_rank": 4.0220898e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "Hazardous <em>Waste</em>&#x2F;Remediation | Research Category | Research Project Database", "snippet": "September 30, 2007 R828771C014 Research Needs in <em>the</em> EPA Regions Covered by <em>the</em> Center for Hazardous Substances in Urban Environments Centers October 1, 2001 through September 30, 2007 R828771C015 Transport of Hazardous Substances <em>Between</em> Brownfields <em>and</em> <em>the</em> Surrounding Urban Atmosphere Centers October", "explanation": null, "document": "Top of Page\nThe perspectives, information and conclusions conveyed in research project abstracts, progress reports, final reports, journal abstracts and journal publications convey the viewpoints of the principal investigator and may not represent the views and policies of ORD and EPA.
