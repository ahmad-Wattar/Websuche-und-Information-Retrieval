Understand their pros and cons to make an informed choice.\nBy Mayo Clinic staff\nIf you're trying to reduce the sugar and calories in your diet, you may be turning to artificial sweeteners or other sugar substitutes. You aren't alone. The popularity of artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes is on the rise as manufacturers and consumers seek lower calorie alternatives to regular white sugar without sacrificing sweetness.\nToday, artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes are found in a variety of food and beverages marketed as \"sugar-free\" or \"diet,\" including soft drinks, chewing gum, jellies, baked goods, candy, fruit juice and ice cream. In addition, other sugar substitutes are being touted as healthier sweeteners than regular sugar, even if they don't have fewer calories, such as honey and agave nectar.\nJust what are all these artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes? And what's their role in your diet?\nUnderstanding artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes\nSugar substitutes are loosely considered any sweetener that you use instead of regular table sugar (sucrose). Artificial sweeteners are just one type of sugar substitute. Some sugar substitutes, such as aspartame, are promoted because they add virtually no calories to your diet. Newer sugar substitutes, including stevia and agave nectar, claim to be lower calorie, tastier and healthier options.\nThe topic of sugar substitutes can be complex and confusing. One problem is that the terminology regarding sugar substitutes is often open to interpretation. For instance, some manufacturers call their sweeteners \"natural\" even though they're processed or refined, as is the case with stevia preparations. And some artificial sweeteners are derived from naturally occurring substances \u2014 sucralose comes from sugar, for example. Sometimes sugar substitutes are categorized by whether or not they contain calories.\nRegardless of what they're called or how they're classified, sugar substitutes aren't magic bullets for weight loss. Take a closer look.\nArtificial sweeteners\nArtificial sweeteners are synthetic sugar substitutes but may be derived from naturally occurring substances, including herbs or sugar itself. Artificial sweeteners are also known as intense sweeteners because they are many times sweeter than regular sugar.\nArtificial sweeteners currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are:\nAcesulfame potassium (Sunett, Sweet One)\nAspartame (Equal, NutraSweet)\nSaccharin (SugarTwin, Sweet'N Low)\nSucralose (Splenda)\nFDA approval is being sought for other artificial sweeteners. And some sweeteners, such as cyclamate, are not approved in the United States but are approved for use in other countries.\nUses for artificial sweeteners\nArtificial sweeteners are attractive alternatives to sugar because they add virtually no calories to your diet. In addition, you need only a fraction compared with the amount of regular sugar you would normally use for sweetness. Artificial sweeteners are widely used in processed products, including tabletop sweeteners, baked goods, soft drinks, powdered drink mixes, candy, puddings, canned foods, jams and jellies, dairy products, and scores of other foods and beverages. Check the food label to see if a product contains artificial sweeteners.\nArtificial sweeteners are also popular for home use. Some can even be used in baking or cooking. Certain recipes may need modification, though, because artificial sweeteners provide no bulk or volume, as does sugar. Check the labels on artificial sweeteners for appropriate home use.\nSome artificial sweeteners may leave an aftertaste. You may need to experiment with artificial sweeteners to find one or a combination that you enjoy most.\nPossible health benefits of artificial sweeteners\nWeight control. One of the most appealing aspects of artificial sweeteners is that they are non-nutritive \u2014 they have virtually no calories. In contrast, each gram of regular table sugar contains 4 calories. A teaspoon of sugar is about 4 grams. For perspective, consider that one 12-ounce can of a sweetened cola contains 8 teaspoons of added sugar, or about 130 calories. If you're trying to lose weight or prevent weight gain, products sweetened with artificial sweeteners rather than with higher calorie table sugar may be an attractive option. On the other hand, some research has suggested that consuming artificial sweeteners may be associated with increased weight, but the cause is not yet known.\nDiabetes. Artificial sweeteners may be a good alternative to sugar if you have diabetes. Unlike sugar, artificial sweeteners generally don't raise blood sugar levels because they are not carbohydrates. But because of concerns about how sugar substitutes are labeled and categorized, always check with your doctor or dietitian about using any sugar substitutes if you have diabetes.\nDental cavities. Unlike sugar, artificial sweeteners don't contribute to tooth decay.\nPossible health concerns with artificial sweeteners\nArtificial sweeteners have been the subject of intense scrutiny for decades. Critics of artificial sweeteners say that they cause a variety of health problems, including cancer. That's largely because of studies dating to the 1970s that linked saccharin to bladder cancer in laboratory rats. Because of those studies, saccharin once carried a warning label that it may be hazardous to your health.\nBut according to the National Cancer Institute and other health agencies, there's no sound scientific evidence that any of the artificial sweeteners approved for use in the United States cause cancer or other serious health problems. And numerous research studies confirm that artificial sweeteners are generally safe in limited quantities, even for pregnant women. As a result of the newer studies, the warning label for saccharin was dropped.\nArtificial sweeteners are regulated by the FDA as food additives. They must be reviewed and approved by the FDA before being made available for sale. In some cases, the FDA declares a substance \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS). These GRAS substances, including highly refined stevia preparations, are deemed by qualified professionals based on scientific data as being safe for their intended use, or they have such a lengthy history of common use in food that they're considered generally safe and don't require FDA approval before sale.\nThe FDA has also established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for each artificial sweetener. This is the maximum amount considered safe to consume each day over the course of your lifetime. ADIs are intended to be about 100 times less than the smallest amount that might cause health concerns.\nSugar alcohols and novel sweeteners\nSugar alcohols (polyols) are carbohydrates that occur naturally in certain fruits and vegetables, but they also can be manufactured. They're not considered intense sweeteners, because they aren't sweeter than sugar \u2014 in fact, some are less sweet than sugar. Sugar alcohols aren't considered noncaloric or non-nutritive sweeteners because they contain calories. But they're lower in calories than is regular sugar, making them an attractive alternative. Despite their name, sugar alcohols aren't alcoholic. They don't contain ethanol, which is found in alcoholic beverages.\nNovel sweeteners are combinations of various types of sweeteners. Novel sweeteners, such as stevia, are hard to fit into one particular category because of what they're made from and how they're made.\nAs with artificial sweeteners, the FDA regulates the use of sugar alcohols. Approved sugar alcohols and novel sweeteners include:\nErythritol\n"}, {"score": 2188.3108, "uuid": "f93d7d3f-e048-5170-8c0c-3d8fa2bffe1b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0207wb-32-16066", "target_hostname": "www.mayoclinic.com", "target_uri": "http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/artificial-sweeteners/MY00073/UPDATEAPP=false&FLUSHCACHE=0", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "<em>Artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em>: Understanding these and other <em>sugar</em> substitutes", "snippet": "<em>Artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em> <em>are</em> also known as intense <em>sweeteners</em> because they <em>are</em> many times sweeter <em>than</em> regular <em>sugar</em>. <em>Artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em> currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <em>are</em>: FDA approval is being sought for other <em>artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "online community.\nArtificial sweeteners: Understanding these and other sugar substitutes\nWhether your goal is cutting calories or eating healthier, options for sugar substitutes abound.

Doing this can help decrease one\u2019s chances of getting diabetes and being overweight or obese---both epidemics in this country with adults and children alike. Consider these facts:\nSince 1985, childhood diabetes has increased ten-fold. The Centers for Disease Control predicts that if this trend continues, one out of every three children born beginning in 2000 will develop diabetes in their lifetime.\nAbout 2/3 of U.S. adults are overweight or obese; while up to 30% of children are overweight, compared to 4% in 1982. In the past 25 years, obesity in children has more than doubled, affecting at least 15% of school-age children!\nThe average American ingests over 150 lbs. of sugar annually! That represents a whopping 30- 5 lb. bags of sugar each year! In reality, much of this sugar is in the form of high fructose corn syrup prevalent in foods because it\u2019s much cheaper than sucrose, common tabletop sugar.\nWhile some might think that artificial sweeteners are the best solution to curb our love affair with sugar, others disagree. Artificial sweeteners do eliminate the high calories and carbohydrates associated with sugar, however many believe that these alternatives are unsafe and are actually worse than sugar. So is there yet another alternative available?\nIf there were an all-natural sweetening ingredient that\u2019s been used safely for over 30 years in other parts of the world for food applications and diabetes management with no ill effects, would you be interested? Well, such a substance does exist and it\u2019s called stevia.\nUsing stevia, an all-natural alternative to sugar and artificial sweeteners, is gaining increasing popularity worldwide. Stevia rebaudiana, its botanical name, is derived from a plant in the chrysanthemum family grown primarily in South America and Asia. The plant\u2019s intense sweetening qualities are complex molecules called steviosides that are glycosides made of glucose, sophorose and steviol. These are what make stevia up to 300 times sweeter than sugar and non-caloric. These glycosides do not get absorbed into the body; rather simply pass through leaving no calories. The Japanese have used stevia in food applications from soft drinks to soy sauce since the 1970s and recent reports indicate that stevia commands up to an incredible 50% share of Japan\u2019s commercial sweetener market. Moreover countries like Brazil use stevia for the treatment for diabetes.\nThe advantages to stevia are numerous, so the following are the most frequently cited. In its pure form, it\u2019s non-caloric and doesn\u2019t affect glucose levels, an advantage for diabetics and hypoglycemics. Also, it has no carbohydrates or fat, so it\u2019s great for dieters, especially those watching carb intake. Unlike artificial sweeteners, high quality stevia has little aftertaste when measured properly. It has no known side effects like some chemical sweeteners and has been safely consumed around the world for decades. Actually, stevia\u2019s original medicinal uses date back centuries ago with the Paraguan Indians who mixed the herb in teas for its healing properties. Since stevia is sugar-free, candida sufferers can use it. Health conscious consumers take advantage of stevia to avoid sugar and help prevent diabetes and obesity. The website www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov , under the direction of the National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine and National Center of Biotechnology Information, offers abstracts from stevia studies that indicate it may also aid in lowering blood pressure and regulating glucose levels.\nThe average consumer may not have heard about stevia until recently because of its current FDA approval as a dietary supplement, not as a sweetener or food additive. Numerous studies worldwide tout its overall safety and health benefits. As of this writing, about ten countries, including Japan, Paraguay and Brazil have approved stevia as a sweetener and/or food additive. The FDA approved the use of stevia only as a dietary supplement since 1995. This means stevia companies must maintain a fairly low profile, thereby limiting its distribution and marketing potential. For instance, health food stores and natural grocers must place stevia in the supplements section, not with the natural sweeteners for fear of the FDA mandate. The stores cannot promote the \u201csweetening\u201d qualities of stevia, even though that\u2019s why it is purchased.\nStevia can be used as a healthy substitute in most sugar applications, including baking and cooking since it is heat stable. The average conversion rate of sugar to stevia is one cup of sugar per one teaspoonful of pure stevia extract. Clearly very little stevia is needed to replace sugar. When used in beverages, stevia dissolves quickly and easily and, depending on your taste preference, only a pinch is needed. The real challenge to using stevia effectively is knowing what ingredients to use in a recipe to make up for the volume and consistency lost with the elimination of sugar, especially in baked goods. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to find stevia cookbooks with proven recipes when you\u2019re starting out. You can also find some free recipes online. Finally, stevia is not appropriate in recipes that require sugar caramelizing or browning like meringues.\nStevia is available in many forms including liquid, teas, plants/leaves, pure white and green powdered extract and powdered blends with different fillers. In baking, the pure extract is used primarily and, in some cases, the liquid variety. Stevia can be purchased at health food stores, natural grocers, food coops and online. Currently a big push is underway to expand distribution into grocery stores, vitamin shops and drugstores.\nDue to the number of factors that can influence your stevia purchase experience, the following guidelines provide some good advice:\nYou often do get what you pay for; don\u2019t buy based solely on price; taste and quality matter.\nHigher % of stevioside doesn\u2019t necessarily make the stevia better; you can find excellent tasting stevia with this key plant composition at even 80%.\nIf you purchase the green powder for its slightly higher health benefits, it will usually have more aftertaste than the white powder.\nThe product\u2019s country of origin doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s farming, manufacturing and processing experience and techniques do.\nAt this time, stevia production is not standardized, so taste and strength do differ depending on brand.\nUse a minimal amount; can be overwhelming if you add too much initially; add more later if needed.\nWidespread use of sugar and artificial sweeteners are at dangerous levels. The negative side effects and controversial studies regarding their proposed safety suggest that another alternative is desirable and necessary. Stevia may be a welcome option for those who want to ingest more natural ingredients with no known side effects, no calories, no carbs, no fat, no affect on glucose levels and no sugar or artificial sweeteners. Stevia may also be advantageous in the prevention and treatment of diabetes, obesity and other health conditions. Check with your doctor before including stevia to your diet. If he/she doesn\u2019t recommend it, politely ask why to see if the reason is satisfactory to you.\nFor more information on stevia or to try free stevia recipes, visit the web or www.steviadessert.com and cookbooks like Sensational Stevia Desserts by Lisa Jobs, $19.95 retail price, Healthy Lifestyle Publishing LLC, Copyright \u00a92005.

But for those of us with a sweet tooth, that can be tough. However, Fitness Expert Basheerah Ahmad says you don't necessarily have to give up sugar completely.\n\"It's no secret that Americans love sugar,\" she says. \"In fact, over the last 20 years in the U.S., we have increased our consumption of sugar from 26 pounds to 135 pounds per person per year. High consumption of sugar in the body can relate to heart disease, obesity and diabetes.\"\nSo how can we get our sweet fix and stay as healthy as possible?\n\"Now in order to help you choose which sugar is best for you, I've separated our sweeteners into two categories,\" explains Basheerah. \"The first are natural sugars, and the second are artificial sweeteners. So, with our natural sugars, we have table sugar or white sugar, very chemically refined and void of nutrients. In fact, the body has to borrow from healthy cells in order to metabolize it.\nThen we have our raw sugar or brown sugar, a little bit chemically refined, but it has a little bit more nutritional content.\nNow we have our honey. Most of us think honey comes from bees, it doesn't get any more natural than that. But what we forget is, it's extremely refined. And also, honey has more calories per serving than any form of sugar. So be careful when consuming large amounts of honey.\nNow for those of you who are cutting calories and want to avoid natural sugars altogether, you may have considered using artificial sweeteners. But you have to remember artificial sweeteners are loaded with chemicals, some with names I can't even pronounce. So are they really the better choice?\nMy personal favorite is any sugar that comes from the Stevia plant. Not only does it have zero calories, but it's also completely natural.\"\nSo the next time you need to get your sugar fix, reach for something that's low in calories, but also natural and won't hurt your body.\nCopyright 2012 America Now.

It\u2019s those little white packets next to the NutraSweet and Equal in the glass tray at the diner. The name \u201cDomino\u201d was coined in the early 190o\u2019s, after the ancestor to the sugar packet: the sugar cube. The trademark name for an otherwise unremarkable commodity kept Domino, and its manufacturer, the American Sugar Refining Company, out at the head of the sugar pack through the 19th century. Today, the Domino Sugar\u00a0 Corp. has no real rivals in the field of refined sugar, according to the experts at the International Directory of Company Histories (Domino history reproduced at FundingUniverse.com). No, the real competition to Domino Sugar is not sugar at all. Analysts warn: \u201cthe trend toward non-caloric artificial sweeteners has started to cut into the firm\u2019s profits.\u201d\nI laughed when I read this. The sugar industry has been grappling with how to sell its product to \u201cdiet conscious consumers\u201d for 60 years. And as I described in previous posts, the explosion of artificial sweeteners in the 1950s challenged the sugar producers and the candy industry alike. (See especially The Plague of Overweight and 1954 Fake Sugar Smack Down )\nBack in the early 1900s, the American Sugar Refining Company dominated the American refined sugar market. It was the first to successfully apply a branding strategy to sugar: not just sugar but DOMINO sugar. Sugar demand and sugar consumption exploded in the 1920s and 1930s. After the painful (and, due to sugar shortages and rationing, much less sweet) war years (1942-1945), Domino was back in full force, feeding the nation\u2019s demand for sugary sweets to the tune of something like $180 million in annual sales.\nBut their was a cloud on the sugar horizon. A big, fat cloud. After a decade of post-war binging, America was feeling the effects. \u201cOverweight\u201d was a national health crisis. Everyone was reducing. No fattening sugar!\nWhat\u2019s\u00a0 a fattening sugar producer to do? Domino had one idea: prove that sugar isn\u2019t fattening.\nLife Magazine, 20 April 1953\nCounting calories these days? You should know that generous amounts of Domino\u2019s Granulated Sugar, used in your favorite foods and beverages, contain fewer calories than usual servings of many foods regularly included in reducing diets.\nBy 1955, this campaign had evolved from \u201csugar has fewer calories than you think\u201d to \u201csugar is for reducing\u201d. the message in this ad, a revision of the 1953 ad above, suggests that heaping three spoons of sugar into your coffee is a better strategy for weight loss than munching on an apple:\nLife Magazine, 3 October 1955\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just apples that dieters might want to reconsider. From the same ad series\nThe final piece of this marketing campaign was this little cookbook for the \u201cslim and trim\u201d:\nAmerica Sugar promoted this booklet as\nthe safe, sure way to lose weight without losing pep or giving up sugar! \u2026 It\u2019s Domino\u2019s effort to put SUGAR\u2013and sugar-containing foods and beverages\u2013back in Reducing Diets\u2026where they belong! (ad to the trade in Confectioners Journal, April 1955 p 9)\nDomino Sugar is going through some changes today. Heard of the Domino Sugar Building on the Williamsburg waterfront? The American Sugar Refining Company built its first sugar refining plant here in my native Brooklyn,. It shut down in 2004 (and will likely be reborn as luxury condos, what else), but this is what it looked like in the late days:\nAnd sugar? Domino is branching out in new directions. They have developed a perplexing array of products for food processing applications known as \u201cnon-sweet sugars\u201d: such oxymorons are evidently useful in things like sports drinks which are sweet but not so sweet, and also in non-fat frostings, frozen desserts and salad dressings where the non-sweet sugar takes the place of some of the fat. The company has also teamed up with erstwhile enemy NutraSweet to develop and market\u2026artificial sweeteners.\nSee my related posts on candy, calorie counting, sugar and artificial sweeteners:\n"}, {"score": 1984.7152, "uuid": "f01bf0b1-6052-557e-82c2-77f2071408b3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0306wb-25-10275", "target_hostname": "bodyecology.com", "target_uri": "https://bodyecology.com/sugar-substitute-lakanto-sweetener.html", "page_rank": 1.3172534e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "No Calorie, <em>Sweetener</em>, <em>Sugar</em> Substitute - Lakanto <em>Sweetener</em>", "snippet": "As you know, though, refined <em>white</em> <em>sugar</em> and corn syrup is poison and even natural <em>sweeteners</em> like agave and honey will feed yeast and make our blood more acidic.

He loves my pies because he can have more than once piece or a larger piece than if it were made with regular sugar. My husband is also border diabetic and I am encouraging him to use this sweetener instead of regular sugar. Too bad it costs so much because I'd buy more if I had the money.\nthe best12/30/11\nBy laney (Greensboro, NC)\nI absolutely was very upset when I could not order this and it was out of stock.

As a matter of fact I ordered two bags this last time because when it was out of stock I almost panicked. You will love it.\nExcellent!12/30/11\nBy Elisabeth (Roswell, GA)\nI am so happy to finally have a natural sweetener that doesn't spike insulin levels; doesn't promote candida; and has no aftertaste.

Make sure you know how much 800g really is before you buy it!\nThis produce is great, tastes good, and works in many things (but does not melt).\nIn place of this, ZSweet works just as well and costs significantly less (and can get it in some stores). Both products are primarily erythritol, and ZSweet is a tiny bit stevia whereas Lakanto is a tiny bit luo han. (note: Truvia is erythritol and stevia...but it's owned by Coco Cola, so I'd go for other brands first!). You could also buy erythritol on its own and just add a slight bit of stevia to it---you'll save tons of money!\nThat being said, I love this product, but there's no way I'm paying for it again! I feel it is very misleading to say it is Luo han, when it is mostly erythritol.\ngood10/12/11\nBy sunshine (ks)\nThe taste is just like sugar but a little sweeter than that.

It is there for me to use whenever I convert a recipe to B.E.D.\nTasty Product10/4/11\nBy Sheri (Ohio)\nThis is a wonderful tasting product with no aftertaste. I made baked apples, mixing Lakanto and cinnamon - it turned out great. It is a good product to give my diabetic husband some \"sweetness\" in his diet without all the side effects.

I don't know why this is, so I've been looking for something that will not affect me. I've tried practically everything with the same result except for Lakanto. I shared it with a friend and she too said that it gave her no fluctuation in mood or otherwise. And it tastes like sugar, without any after taste.

I love this stuff. It taste JUST like sugar on my cereal! My wife's cookies melt in your mouth with sugary goodness. I had learned to love stevia, but it wasn't good for every application of sweetness, so now we have the answer.\nprice 9/12/11\nBy anya (Vallejo, Ca.)\nIt's better than Stevia but highly expensive. I buy it when I feel like a splurge.

It helps when I need to eat something sweet and also has broadened my food options which is always a plus. I think it tastes just as sweet as or better than \"real\" sugar.\ngood sugar substitute8/31/11\nBy Glacierpaws (Lake Stevens, WA)\nOverall, I love this product. I bakes like sugar and has a pretty good taste. The only reason it is not excellent is that is is a bit more coarse than sugar so doesn't do well in all recipes. I still buy it by the bulk and use it or stevia.\nProduct almost out of date8/29/11\nBy Karen (Charlotte, NC)\nI received the Lakanto Sweetener on 8/18/2011 and upon looking at the back of the bag noticed it had an expiration date of 10/11/11. I contacted customer service on 8/18/2011 and was told I would receive a refund, but as of 8/29/2011 there has not been a refund nor is there a refund pending. Selling a product with less than two months before expiration is not a good way to run a business. Someone should have checked this before shipping it out.

No fake aftertaste like most sugar substitutes. Its been a blessing to help curb my sugar cravings. Thanks Donna!\nLakanto good, but can have allergic reaction from Corn8/8/11\nBy catgross49 (Ventura)\nI do like Lakanto very much. Good product, price is rather high, and I don't like the fact that it's derivied from corn. People who are sensitive to corn may have a reaction to it. So, I am hoping that Lakanto will go to a company that makes it Erthitol from something other than corn like grapes. Most people are not allergic to grapes and grapes are a large crop throught out the US. and the World, so it would be easy to change over I would think. So, that's my thought, please change Erythitol from being made from corn to being made from grapes instead, so it safer to eat for all people.\nWonderful Product8/7/11\nBy L.Iglesias (Brooklyn, New York)\nYou cannot buy a better product than Lakanto, it's as sweet as sugar, it has no aftertaste, it retains it sweetness even after cooking with it. And the best part, it has a zero index, no calories, and absolutely does not raise your blood sugar. I was recently in the hospital and used Lankato in my coffee and cereal. The nurse kept poking with the sugar meter and my blood sugar remained at or below 100. The poking was no fun, but the results were nothing less than Wow!!!\nMedicine For Fatigue Pro 8/5/11\nBy DiardTaindy (Cook Islands)\nHello, <a href=http://www.promdressunder100.net/>buy xanax online without prescription</a> Some of the more common complaints include but are not limited to hives, fatigued, loss of coordination, rashes, suicidal ideation, hallucinations, ataxia, short term memory loss, and more. http://www.promdressunder100.net/ - xanax price\nAwesome8/5/11\nBy grrrlgenius (Nashville, TN)\nI use this in everything from tea to coconut flour muffins to low-carb brownies.

It is a fantastic sugar substitute because it tastes so good and it has a similar sweetness to sugar so when subsituting Lakanto in recipes, it is a 1:1 ratio. I am so glad I have found this product as it makes staying away from sugar so much easier.\nAwesome!!7/22/11\nBy Sonja (Summerfield, NC)\nTastes like sugar, looks like sugar, bakes like sugar but it's not!!! I love it and use it daily!\nBakes incredibly well and tastes fantastic. Too expensive. 7/22/11\nBy Maryellen (Leonardtown, MD)\nI love this product, it bakes well and tastes amazing in baked goods. I did try it with icing and that was way too sweet, so I've going to cut down the amount and maybe substitute stevia instead. I wish Body Ecology would sell this in buik and find a way to reduce the price. This is the only sweetner I've found that tastes great in baked goods and doesn't feed yeast, but it's way too expensive.\nGreat taste!7/15/11\nBy apple (Brant Lake, NY)\nI love Lakanto! I enioy it in my tea, bake with it, and sprinkle it on popcorn or toast for a quick sweet treat.

During this period I have tried every kind of low-glycemic, non-candida feeding sugar there is. Lakanto is better tasting than any of them and it does not have the unwanted side effects of sweeteners like Xylitol. Also it is perfect for baking. Regular Erythritol is pretty good but Lakanto is even better. Lakanto has kept me away from tempting sugary treats many times! I highly recommend it!!!

He loves my pies because he can have more than once piece or a larger piece than if it were made with regular sugar. My husband is also border diabetic and I am encouraging him to use this sweetener instead of regular sugar. Too bad it costs so much because I'd buy more if I had the money.\nthe best12/30/11\nBy laney (Greensboro, NC)\nI absolutely was very upset when I could not order this and it was out of stock. It is the very best tasting sweetner that I have ever used and when cooked with quinoa flakes and ghee it gets really syrupy looking and tasting. I love this stuff. As a matter of fact I ordered two bags this last time because when it was out of stock I almost panicked. You will love it.\nExcellent!12/30/11\nBy Elisabeth (Roswell, GA)\nI am so happy to finally have a natural sweetener that doesn't spike insulin levels; doesn't promote candida; and has no aftertaste.

Highly recommend.\ngood, but misleading and WAY too expensive12/22/11\nBy Lisa (New York)\nI bought this product twice--it's way too expensive! Make sure you know how much 800g really is before you buy it!\nThis produce is great, tastes good, and works in many things (but does not melt).\nIn place of this, ZSweet works just as well and costs significantly less (and can get it in some stores). Both products are primarily erythritol, and ZSweet is a tiny bit stevia whereas Lakanto is a tiny bit luo han. (note: Truvia is erythritol and stevia...but it's owned by Coco Cola, so I'd go for other brands first!). You could also buy erythritol on its own and just add a slight bit of stevia to it---you'll save tons of money!\nThat being said, I love this product, but there's no way I'm paying for it again! I feel it is very misleading to say it is Luo han, when it is mostly erythritol.\ngood10/12/11\nBy sunshine (ks)\nThe taste is just like sugar but a little sweeter than that. Price is very very expensive. I am satisfied with this product expect price.\nI Love this Sweetener10/4/11\nBy Jacqui (Hacienda Heights, CA)\nI am enjoying the Lakanto sweetener, which has allowed me to broaden my recipe choices. Being a diabetic as well as suffering from severe systemic candida, Lakanto sweetener has put a little sweet back onto my tastebuds. It is there for me to use whenever I convert a recipe to B.E.D.\nTasty Product10/4/11\nBy Sheri (Ohio)\nThis is a wonderful tasting product with no aftertaste. I made baked apples, mixing Lakanto and cinnamon - it turned out great. It is a good product to give my diabetic husband some \"sweetness\" in his diet without all the side effects. I look forward to the time when this product is more affordable so we can use it more often.\nOur family loves Lakanto9/26/11\nBy Nantzy (Hopland, CA)\nOur family avoids sugar for the most part, so we all are thankful to be able to use Lakanto.

I don't know why this is, so I've been looking for something that will not affect me. I've tried practically everything with the same result except for Lakanto. I shared it with a friend and she too said that it gave her no fluctuation in mood or otherwise. And it tastes like sugar, without any after taste.

I had learned to love stevia, but it wasn't good for every application of sweetness, so now we have the answer.\nprice 9/12/11\nBy anya (Vallejo, Ca.)\nIt's better than Stevia but highly expensive.

It helps when I need to eat something sweet and also has broadened my food options which is always a plus. I think it tastes just as sweet as or better than \"real\" sugar.\ngood sugar substitute8/31/11\nBy Glacierpaws (Lake Stevens, WA)\nOverall, I love this product. I bakes like sugar and has a pretty good taste. The only reason it is not excellent is that is is a bit more coarse than sugar so doesn't do well in all recipes. I still buy it by the bulk and use it or stevia.\nProduct almost out of date8/29/11\nBy Karen (Charlotte, NC)\nI received the Lakanto Sweetener on 8/18/2011 and upon looking at the back of the bag noticed it had an expiration date of 10/11/11. I contacted customer service on 8/18/2011 and was told I would receive a refund, but as of 8/29/2011 there has not been a refund nor is there a refund pending. Selling a product with less than two months before expiration is not a good way to run a business. Someone should have checked this before shipping it out.

No fake aftertaste like most sugar substitutes. Its been a blessing to help curb my sugar cravings. Thanks Donna!\nLakanto good, but can have allergic reaction from Corn8/8/11\nBy catgross49 (Ventura)\nI do like Lakanto very much. Good product, price is rather high, and I don't like the fact that it's derivied from corn. People who are sensitive to corn may have a reaction to it. So, I am hoping that Lakanto will go to a company that makes it Erthitol from something other than corn like grapes. Most people are not allergic to grapes and grapes are a large crop throught out the US. and the World, so it would be easy to change over I would think. So, that's my thought, please change Erythitol from being made from corn to being made from grapes instead, so it safer to eat for all people.\nWonderful Product8/7/11\nBy L.Iglesias (Brooklyn, New York)\nYou cannot buy a better product than Lakanto, it's as sweet as sugar, it has no aftertaste, it retains it sweetness even after cooking with it. And the best part, it has a zero index, no calories, and absolutely does not raise your blood sugar. I was recently in the hospital and used Lankato in my coffee and cereal. The nurse kept poking with the sugar meter and my blood sugar remained at or below 100. The poking was no fun, but the results were nothing less than Wow!!!\nMedicine For Fatigue Pro 8/5/11\nBy DiardTaindy (Cook Islands)\nHello, <a href=http://www.promdressunder100.net/>buy xanax online without prescription</a> Some of the more common complaints include but are not limited to hives, fatigued, loss of coordination, rashes, suicidal ideation, hallucinations, ataxia, short term memory loss, and more. http://www.promdressunder100.net/ - xanax price\nAwesome8/5/11\nBy grrrlgenius (Nashville, TN)\nI use this in everything from tea to coconut flour muffins to low-carb brownies.

I did try it with icing and that was way too sweet, so I've going to cut down the amount and maybe substitute stevia instead. I wish Body Ecology would sell this in buik and find a way to reduce the price. This is the only sweetner I've found that tastes great in baked goods and doesn't feed yeast, but it's way too expensive.\nGreat taste!7/15/11\nBy apple (Brant Lake, NY)\nI love Lakanto!

During this period I have tried every kind of low-glycemic, non-candida feeding sugar there is. Lakanto is better tasting than any of them and it does not have the unwanted side effects of sweeteners like Xylitol. Also it is perfect for baking. Regular Erythritol is pretty good but Lakanto is even better. Lakanto has kept me away from tempting sugary treats many times! I highly recommend it!!!

It is of white color, powdery and has no particular smell. Although it is said to be a sugar substitute, it is important to note that these substitutes can be subdivided into natural (for example, agave) and artificial sweeteners (e.g. aspartame). This report will expound on aspartame in particular. In 1965 chemist James M. Schlatter, working in G.D. Searle & Company, discovered this sweetener albeit by accident, when he was working on an antiulcer drug candidate.\nAspartame was first synthesized as an artificial non-saccharide sweetener used in some beverages and foods. It is a methyl ester of the phenylalanine dipeptide. This sweetener is approximately two hundred times sweeter than table sugar, because of which its calorific contribution is negligible. Aspartame and other artificial sweeteners have a distinctive difference from the normal sugars, especially regarding the onset of sweetness and how long it lasts, though aspartame is the closest in terms of taste to the table sugar. Since the sweetness of aspartame lasts longer than sucrose, it is mostly used together with other artificial sweeteners to produce a more natural sugary taste.\nPrimarily, aspartame was derived from aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol, which occur naturally in food through the processes of fermentation and synthesis. The direct fermentation process, which takes about three days, produces a contingent of bacteria enough to produce the required amino acids. These bacteria are destroyed at the end of the process to remain with the amino acids. The synthesis process involves a number of chemical pathways, but generally in order to form aspartame phenylalanine is combined with methanol, then with aspartic acid. The solid residue made after the metacatalyst has been taken away is filtered in an aqueous ethanol solution and then recrystallized to give the powder aspartame.\nThe natural residue components of aspartame are aspartic acid, methanol and phenylalanine, which are realized when this sweetener is broken down once it has been digested. There occurs further digestion, the results being formaldehyde and formic acid, which is believed to be the cause of injury in methanol poisoning if it accumulates. However, for those who have the condition called Phenylketonuria (PKU), the sweetener is not advisable to use simply because phenylalanine is not properly metabolized in this case.\nAspartame holds one significant advantage \u2013 it offers a perfect option for diabetics or those on a low calorie diet to enjoy a wide variety of desserts with low fat. Its introduction in diet is good for the reduction of blood sugar levels for people suffering from diabetes.\nMuch has been said about the benefits of aspartame, but, as a naturopathic nutritionist, I would not use this sweetener chiefly because of its side effects, which include eye and ear complications, psychological imbalances, neurologic complications and allergies.\nAlthough aspartame is currently the best alternative to natural sugar, scientists are still researching to find better options mainly on blending alternatives, improving aspartame efficiency and new derivatives.\nCategories:\n"}, {"score": 1757.9137, "uuid": "17cdd576-8edb-547b-96e5-95739467208b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0302wb-41-05478", "target_hostname": "www.thewayup.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thewayup.com/newsletters/121505.htm", "page_rank": 1.2329808e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "The Way Up Newsletter : <em>Artificial</em> <em>Sweeteners</em>", "snippet": "There <em>are</em> also &quot;natural <em>sweeteners</em>&quot;, other <em>than</em> cane or beet <em>sugar</em>.

They are not allowing information which has been well researched and can be found in the research literature to be associated with a product. They even sent me an alert letter giving me 15 days to remove some correct information from my web site, or to risk search and seizure at my place of business. I am sure I am not the only one.\nOn November 9, Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.) and seven other members of Congress introduced the Health Freedom Protection Act (H.R. 4282) to prevent the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from censoring information about dietary supplements. You can read his statements at http://www.hr4282.org/paul.htm\nAccording to The Liberty Committee, \"In 1994, the U.S. Congress ordered the FDA to let the public have access to scientific articles and publications on the role of nutrients in disease by passing the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)....Yet, censorship by the FDA goes on!\" That is why H.R. 4282 was introduced and is being pushed by a coalition of some 50 companies and organizations.\nCongressman Paul explains that the Health Freedom Protection Act specifically will: (1) stop the FDA from censoring truthful claims about dietary supplements; (2) stop the FDA from prohibiting the distribution of scientific articles and publications regarding the role of nutrients in protecting against disease; and (3) address the FTC's violations of the First Amendment.\nIn a related matter, Emord & Associates, a law firm specializing in constitutional and administrative law, has started a national petition campaign to end the FDA's and FTC's violations of the First Amendment. The FDA and FTC violate free speech by trying to control what is communicated about nutrient-disease associations, according to the firm. It has drafted a petition to protest suppression of this health information and hopes to present Congress more than a million signatures by January 1, 2006.\nPLEASE GO TO http://www.emord.com TO PRINT AND TO SIGN THIS PETITION, THEN GET OTHERS TO SIGN IT AND MAIL IT IN.

We know sugar is bad for us, but are we able to avoid it most of the time???? After all, the USDA statistics show the average consumption of sugar to be about 20 teaspoons daily. And that is only what is added to food and drink, excluding the naturally occurring food sugars. The most commonly consumed sugars are sucrose, dextrose, corn syrup and fructose. These sugars raise blood sugar and insulin levels more than others do and can pile on fat. You can see my newsletter on the health effects of excess insulin.\nWhat are our alternatives? Are they also harmful? What are the possible side effects of \"artificial sweeteners\"? What is the safe maximum daily dose? How can you know if you don't tolerate certain \"artificial sweeteners\"?\nI'll tell you right up front that saccharin is the safest of the \"artificial\" sweeteners and Stevia is one of the safest of the natural sweeteners. Neither of these increase blood sugar, increase insulin levels, increase weight, or are associated with adverse symptoms.\nHowever it is important to remember that most of those who get in trouble with any kind of a sweetener have done so because of over indulgence. We are conditioned to a sweet taste. The manufacturers have created a sweets polluted diet for us and continue to exploit our desires for \"sweet\".\nThere are also \"natural sweeteners\", other than cane or beet sugar. Then there are natural verses refined sugars. Sweet and sugar everywhere, with hardly a food label without a form of sweetener. How can you find your way through the markets maze and craze to cater to our conditioned taste for sweets?\nBeing an ex~sugarholic, and liking a sweet taste, I thought I was doing fine with some Aspartame found in Equal and Nutrasweet. But my eyes were red, burning, itching, and my eyelids were crusty and stinging. Who would have ever thought???? Did an updated allergy test on myself and lo and behold, a severe allergy to Aspartame. Stopped the Equal and the eyes cleared, restarted and the problem came back. Now what? I also had a moderate allergy to saccharin most commonly found in Sweet n Low. So a quest for new, safe, tasty sweeteners was begun.\nYou may have heard some of the general drawbacks of the artificial sweeteners which would apply to most people. But you probably have not thought much about them being an issue from an allergy/intolerance point of view. Fortunately, we can test for that. The test I use for allergies is the Comprehensive Panel II from Alcat.com. Click on the 'Comprehensive Panels', then 'Order Panel II' if you wish to take the test. This includes 100 foods, 21 molds, 10 food additives such as the artificial sweeteners, 10 food colorings, and 10 common environmental chemicals and costs $381.92. The food test portion will also test for cane, corn and beet sugar allergies. If you are allergic to corn, you would avoid corn syrup as a food sweetener.\nIf you only want to check for the artificial sweeteners, you can save money by just ordering the 10 Food Additives Panel for $87.50. You can browse around their website for more information.\nSome people are not necessarily \"allergic\" to glucose (sugar) or fructose (fruit sugar) , but are nevertheless intolerant of these sugars or have a metabolic difficulty processing them in their bodies. This may result in problems.\nSymptoms of fructose intolerance can be behavioral changes, depressed immune function, dizziness, fatigue, headache, and weakness. There can also be increased triglycerides, an interference with copper metabolism, and increased uric acid as in gout.\nA glucose/insulin metabolism imbalance can be a cause of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia (diabetes). There may also be insulin resistance and the development of obesity. Other symptoms of this imbalance can be cold hands and feet, disorientation, dizziness, fatigue, headache, nausea, and any of the other myriad of symptoms associated with too high or too low blood sugar.\nThese glucose and fructose intolerances can be tested as part of the FIA Comprehensive 5000 Analysis at SpectraCell.com and click on lab services. You can click on find a clinician to locate a nearby Dr to order this test for you.\nNATURAL SWEETENERS\nThe first 2 natural sweeteners are the most recommended of the group. The rest of the natural sweeteners can be varied and used in moderation. When applicable, organic is always preferable. The best of the natural sweeteners for minimal blood sugar effect are Stevia, Lo Han Kuo Fruit, and the sugar alcohols to be discussed below. All of the natural sweeteners contain some calories, (though less than sugar) except for Stevia and Lo Han Kuo fruit\nSTEVIA EXTRACT\nis derived from the leaves of the Stevia plant. It was used for centuries by the Indians in South America as a remedy for diabetes and gum disease. Stevia has also been reported to possess anti-viral activity and may have blood pressure lowering properties. The Japanese food processors have used it widely in many foods since the 1970's. The FDA has approved it as a food supplement, but not as a sweetener. Stevia is 250-300 times sweeter than glucose. What I like about Stevia is it contains no calories and does not increase blood sugar, so it is safe for diabetics and hypoglycemics. Stevia can vary in taste. A problem I previously found with some of the liquid extracts of Stevia was the taste was too strong and overwhelmed what I was sweetening. But I have found some excellent products which do not do this. Use small amounts as it is very sweet. You might be happiest with the Stevia products , especially the White Stevia Powder.\nLO HAN KUO FRUIT (SLIMSWEET, SWEETLIFE)\nis derived from a Chinese fruit containing a natural sweetening agent called a mogroside which is 300 times sweeter than cane sugar. I like it because it also creates no increase in blood sugar and contains no calories. For more you can see http://www.nunaturals.com/products/lohan.html\nD-TAGATOSE (WHEY-LOW, NATURLOSE)\nis a natural whey-derived sugar which has 1 calorie per gram verses table sugar at 4 calories per gram. It has a reduced glycemic index of 20 verses 100 for glucose. This is important to diabetics, low-carb dieters, and glucose intolerants. Whey sugar does contain lactose, so those intolerant of this should avoid.\nRAW ORGANIC HONEY\nis not heated or processed and thus maintains the nutrients found in honey.\nMAPLE SYRUP\nis one of the best liquid sweeteners. There are 3 grades of maple syrup. Grade A is the lightest and least maple tasting while Grade C is the heaviest and darkest.\nINULIN\nis what is called a fructo oligosaccharide, very high in soluble fiber, with minimal blood sugar and insulin consequence. Inulin is usually derived from Jerusalem Artichokes, or chicory roots. Inulin passed through the upper bowel to reach the lower bowel intact. There it is fermented by bacteria in the bowel and there it feeds organisms such as the desirable acidophilus and bifidus.\nSome inulin-based products are BeFlora Plus and Bake Flora. These are a blend of oligofructose, fructose(hydrolyzed from the oligofructose) , and enriched sprouted mung bean extract. BeFlora Plus is 10 times sweeter than sugar, and Beflora is equal to sugar in sweetness. Bakeflora is equal to sugar in sweetness. The drawback is a small amount of the sweetener Acesulfame K is added to the nutritive mixture upon which the sprouted mung beans are grown. You can see more on these products at http://www.roxlor.com/bakeflora/prodapp.html\nBARLEY MALT\nis a slow digesting sweetener made from sprouted barley which is broken down in to the sugar maltose. It is not as sweet as honey. It is boldly flavored but can be a good substitute for brown sugar. You can use it as syrup or a powder.\nBROWN RICE SYRUP OR GRANULATED BROWN RICE SWEETENER\nis made from brown rice and sometimes sprouted whole barley. It is a complex sugar which allows it to be broken down and absorbed more slowly than simple sugars, thus causing less of a blood sugar spike, but still will impact blood sugar. Brown rice sweeteners have a mild flavor similar to honey but less intensely sweet. Its delicate flavor allows it to meld well with other ingredients.\nAMASAKE\n(is a sweet creamy beverage made from fermented sweet brown rice),\nFRUIT CONCENTRATE OR FRUIT JUICE SWEETENERS\nare often used in sugar free pastries and other food and drink items. This most often is stated as pear or apple juice concentrate,. These are a combination of the simple sugars, fructose, glucose, and sucrose. This contains 2.3 calories per gram. Fructose can elevate triglycerides levels.\nORGANIC MOLASSES\nas a syrup or a powder. Molasses is a by product of the process of refining sugar cane in to table sugar. Sweet molasses or light molasses has a lighter flavor than blackstrap molasses which has a strong bitter tart favor which is too interfering to use as a sweetener unless you don't mind it influencing the taste of whatever is being sweetened. It is more nutritious re vitamins, minerals, and trace elements than most other sweeteners.\nSORGHUM SYRUP\nis produced by crushing sorghum plants. It too has a strong taste and contains iron, calcium and potassium\nDATE SUGAR\nis ground from dehydrated dates. It is high in fiber and rich in vitamins and minerals. It is useful in cooking, but not in sweetening beverages as the tiny pieces will not dissolve.\nAGAVE NECTAR\nis extracted from the inner core of the Agave cactus plant . It tastes like a cross between honey and maple syrup.\nORGANIC DRIED NATURAL CANE JUICE (SUCANET)\nmay contain some calories, but also has some nutritional value.\nTREHALOSE\nis a new sweetener. It is found naturally in honey, mushrooms and other foods. But Trehalose is commercially produced from cornstarch, which can cause allergic reactions and stomach irritations in some people.\nYACON\nis a sweet root from South America which is used there to lower blood sugar and help treat diabetes. it has not yet been commercially produced as a sweetener, but it is available as a honey and a jam\nSUGAR ALCOHOLS: XYLITOL, SORBITOL, ERYTHRITOL, MANNITOL, MALTITOL, LACTITOL.\nSugar alcohols do not have sugar, but do have carbohydrates, and approximately \u00bd-3/4 the calories of regular sugar. Sugar alcohols occur naturally in foods and come from plants such as fruits and berries. These sweeteners can be used with diabetes, but can mildly change blood sugar levels. All who eat sugar alcohols must be careful of the quantity of intake BECAUSE EXCESSIVE CONSUMPTION OF THE SUGAR ALCOHOLS CAN CAUSE GAS AND/OR DIARRHEA. The tendency towards this varies with each product.\nXYLITOL\nis preferable to the other sugar alcohols . It was discovered in 1891 and has been used as a sweetener since the 1960's. It is safe to use with no consumption limits other than some risk for gas or diarrhea with too high an individual dose, but Xylitol causes less gastrointestinal symptoms than most of the other sugar alcohols. Xylitol has been well researched with around 1500 published studies. . It is approved for use as a sweetener in 35 countries and is starting to become more popular in the U.S. It is the only sugar alcohol which fights the bacteria that causes gum disease and cavities. It also decreases plaque formation. Xylitol is an excellent choice for sugarless gum. Xylitol helps prevent sinus and ear infections, and may guard against osteoporosis. It also inhibits yeast overgrowth. It does not cause significant changes in blood sugar or insulin levels, and has 40% less calories than regular sugar. Some studies suggested that controlling gum infections in diabetics also helped to control and to decrease blood sugar. A study showed that as many as 18% of premature births were caused by gum disease, an impact as strong as that of smoking or alcohol abuse. Studies have also suggested Xylitol increases energy by enhancing ATP production, increases utilization of fat, increases endurance, and has antioxidant functions.\nSORBITOL\nis commonly used in a wide range of dietetic foods, liquid over the counter, and prescription medicines. It is 50-70% as sweet as sugar and 1.6 calories/gram. It can create more gastrointestinal discomfort and diarrhea than Xylitol., or the other sugar alcohols. Children are especially prone to this. Citizens have called for the FDA to require a warning label on Sorbitol containing products to read as follows, \"NOTICE: This product contains Sorbitol which may cause diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain. Not suitable for consumption by children. To protect yourself, start by eating no more than one serving at a time.\"\nERYTHRITOL\nis a white powder with a taste similar to sucrose, but about 70% as sweet and 0.2 calories/gram, the lowest calories of the sugar alcohols. This sugar alcohol has fewer calories and a better digestive tolerance than most of the other sugar alcohols except Xylitol. It does not affect blood sugar or insulin levels.\nISOMALT\nis 45-65% as sweet as sugar and 2 calories/gram. It is derived from sugar by enzymatic conversion to isomaltose. It is used in some prepared and baked foods.\nLACTITOL\nis derived from lactose (from milk) and is 30-40% as sweet as sucrose and 2 calories/gram.\nMALTITOL\nis made from maltose which is derived from chicory and roasted malt. It is 90% as sweet as sucrose and 2.1 calories per gram.\nARTIFICIAL (CHEMICAL) SWEETENERS\nThese usually have no calories and do not raise blood sugar. However, some are problematic when used in excess. There has been considerable debate and controversy about these ill effects.\nSACCHARIN (SWEET N LOW, SUGAR TWIN, SUCARYL, SWEET MAGIC, ZERO-CAL)\nSaccharin was first discovered in 1879 and has been used around the world for almost 100 years. The common brand name is Sweet and Low. If you are not allergic to it, as discussed above, my opinion is that it is one of the safer of the artificial sweeteners. The old fear about it possibly being implicated in bladder cancer has been debunked. Saccharin also works well as a sugar substitute in cooking. It is 500 times sweeter than sugar.\n.\nSaccharin is one of the most studied food ingredients and the totality of evidence indicates it is safe for human consumption. Challenges to the safety of saccharin began in 1977. Interestingly, the same time as the \"political way\" was being paved for Aspartame which was introduced in to our food supply in 1981, after first being approved in 1974, then withdrawn because of sloppy research from 1967-1975. Aspartame was nevertheless later approved, despite the persistence of inconclusive evidence as to its safety, and Aspartame somewhat knocked saccharin down and almost out of the market place for awhile.\nSUCRALOSE (SPLENDA)\nSplenda is actually made from sugar, so you would not use it if you are allergic or intolerant to sugar. Pre-approval research has shown that long term or heavy use may contribute to serious chronic immunological or neurological disorders.\nSplenda has had considerable recent promotion, but is not a sweetener I advise using. As of May 2004 over 3000 products were marketed which are sweetened with Splenda. For more detail about potential risks with Splenda see http://www.splendaexposed.com/ or for a complete book on the topic see http://www.issplendasafe.com/\nACESULFAM-K ( Sunette, Sweet & Safe, Sweet One)\nWas approved by the FDA for use as a sweetener in 1988. It is not adequately studied and some of the studies are controversial.\nCYCLAMATE (Sugar Twin)\nHas lingering questions about toxicity risks, especially testicular. Though approved for use in 50 countries, it is not approved in the United States.\nASPARTAME (Equal, Nutrasweet)\nThis is one of my least recommended and the most dangerous of the alternative sweeteners. It is also the most extensively added to our food and drink. See the Aspartame Consumer Safety Network , The Aspartame (Nutrasweet) Toxicity Information Center , or Aspartame the Bad News for relevant details.\nCurrently, aspartame is consumed by over 200 million people around the world and is found in more than 6,000 products including carbonated soft drinks, powdered soft drinks, chewing gum, confections, gelatins, dessert mixes, puddings and fillings, frozen desserts, yogurt, tabletop sweeteners, and some pharmaceuticals such as vitamins and sugar-free cough drops. In the United States, all food ingredients, including aspartame, must be listed in the ingredient statement on the food label.\nThree Senate hearings have been conducted on the safety of aspartame, and the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) in Washington, D.C., now lists it as the third-worst additive.\nIf you really want to delve in to this, you can read the book, Deadly Deception - Story of Aspartame [1998].\nWHAT TO DO?\nStop eating or drinking anything with refined white sugar (sucrose, glucose ) on some labels. Avoid high fructose corn syrup, brown sugar, which is often mixed with molasses or sprayed with caramel coloring , raw sugar, corn syrup, and turbinado sugar.\nAvoid Aspartame (Nutrasweet, Equal) and all the artificial sweeteners except saccharin.\nVary the sweeteners you do use.\nYou can use saccharin (Sweet and Low). Select from the list of natural sweeteners above. Stevia or Lo Han Kuo are healthy and preferable. However, remember if it tastes very sweet it likely has too much sweetener in it. If a sweetener is listed as one of the first ingredients on a product, it is one of the main components of that food by weight, so avoid it.\nUntil next time, many blessings\nPriscilla Slagle M.D.\n\"DON'T CRY BECAUSE IT'S OVER----SMILE BECAUSE IT HAPPENED\"\nPlease email me with your suggestion for future newsletter topics at pslagle@dc.rr.com\n"}, {"score": 1677.2549, "uuid": "ca84624f-eb14-5324-90ab-1de329138669", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0713wb-07-07358", "target_hostname": "www.westonaprice.org", "target_uri": "http://www.westonaprice.org/modern-foods/sugar-free-blues", "page_rank": 1.1993833e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "<em>Sugar</em>-Free Blues: Everything You Wanted to Know About <em>Artificial</em> <em>Sweeteners</em>", "snippet": "<em>white</em> <em>sugar</em>, at least one doesn\u2019t have to wear chemical goggles to work with it!", "explanation": null, "document": "Fructooligosaccharides (FOS)\nTerminology\nThe substances which will be discussed here are often referred to on product labels by many (seemingly) interchangeable terms: artificial/synthetic sweeteners, sugar alternatives, alternative sweeteners, non-nutritive sweeteners, non-caloric/low-cal/low-carb sweeteners, diabetic-safe sweeteners, etc. Many of these terms seem to be used as synonyms.\nFor some clarity on the issue, we shall quote from the American Dietetic Association (ADA): \"Although sweeteners can be grouped a number of different ways, the grouping \"nutritive\" and \"non-nutritive\" acknowledges a difference in the amount of energy provided by sweeteners. Nutritive sweeteners include sugar sweeteners (e.g., refined sugars, high fructose corn syrup, crystalline fructose, glucose. . . concentrated fruit juice) and. . . sugar alcohols (e.g., sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, isomalt, and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates). Non-nutritive sweeteners (e.g., saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame-K. . . sucralose [and neotame]) offer no energy, and, as they sweeten with little volume, can also be referred to as high-intensity sweeteners. Both sugar alcohols and non-nutritive sweeteners can replace sugar sweeteners and are therefore termed macronutrient substitutes, sugar substitutes, sugar replacers, or alternative sweeteners.\n\"Some sweeteners are considered Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) ingredients and others are considered food additives. . . . The safety limit of food additives. . . (is) expressed as the acceptable daily intake (ADI), that is, the estimated amount per kilogram body weight that a person can safely consume every day over a lifetime without risk.. . . \"1 While one might justifiably quibble with the ADA over its use of the term \"nutritive\" to describe many highly-refined sweeteners, that is how the Diet Dictocrats have structured the official terminology.\nAspartame\nThe FDA has approved 5 non-nutritive sweeteners: aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame K, sucralose and neotame.2,3 The most widely used non-nutritive sweetener is aspartame, scientifically known as 1-aspartyl 1-phenylalanine methyl ester.4 It was discovered by accident in 1965 by Mr. James Schlatter, a scientist who was working on new drugs to treat ulcers, when he licked his fingers to pick up a piece of paper and accidentally tasted the intense sweetness of the compound he had created.\nAspartame is 180 times sweeter than sucrose (common table sugar).6 According to the ADA: \"Demand for aspartame in the United States rose from 8.4 million pounds in 1986 to 17.5 million pounds in 1992, a figure that represents more than 80 percent of the world demand. Although soft drinks account for more than 70 percent of aspartame consumption, this sweetener is added to more than 6,000 foods, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals.\nAspartame is approved for use in more than 100 nations.7 It has been sold around the world under various brand names including NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonfuls, Canderel, Bienvia, NatraSweet and Miwon. Its widespread usage has left an extensive trail of complaints and documentation of its negative side effects. Consequently, there is a great deal to be said on the subject of aspartame.\nIn 1974 the Food and Drug Administration gave its first halting approval to aspartame, then a product of pharmaceutical giant G.D. Searle & Company. Searle owned the original patent on aspartame and did the original laboratory studies on its safety. These studies turned out very badly and remain as some of the most damning evidence against aspartame\u2019s safety.8 Two of Searle\u2019s own scientists, concerned about the safety of the new product, filed a formal objection to try to keep aspartame from coming to the market.9 A team from the FDA conducted its own study of Searle\u2019s data and on the corpses of aspartame-poisoned mice, and issued a scathing document called the Bressler Report.10 This report, however, did not spell the end for aspartame.\nFollowing the issuance of the Bressler Report came a period of thickening political intrigue and red tape, wherein two key figures at the FDA failed to press forward with further investigations, only to leave the FDA for jobs with Searle\u2019s law firm, Sidley & Austin. Higher authorities in the FDA quietly consigned the Bressler Report to the archives, and only made it public later, through a Freedom of Information Act Request.11 While the public remained ignorant, Searle & Co had maneuvered to bring in Donald Rumsfeld, previously the Chief of Staff in the Ford Administration and the then Secretary of Defense, as their new CEO. According to a former Searle employee, Rumsfeld told them that \"no matter what, he would see to it that aspartame would be approved. . . \"12\nSearle re-applied for FDA approval of aspartame on the very same day that Ronald Reagan took office in 1980. There were plenty of favors to be called in from within the new Administration, and significant clout was also to be wielded by Robert Shapiro and Utah Senator Orrin Hatch. Senator Hatch has been an outspoken advocate for the sweetener, possibly due to his holdings in Twin Lab, a health supplement company that has used aspartame in a number of their products.13\nBetween 1981 and 1985, Rumsfeld and Searle began seeing the payoff for their newly-formed subsidiary, the NutraSweet Company. Amidst ongoing controversy, aspartame was slowly but surely given full FDA approval. Dr. Michael Friedman, then the acting head of the FDA, later accepted a high-level position at Monsanto, the corporation which was to purchase the NutraSweet Company from Searle in 1985.14 Monsanto has also brought the world such atrocities as Agent Orange, PCBs, dioxins, Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH), Round-Up herbicide and a host of genetically modified foods.15\nThe company has made a fortune off aspartame, at the expense of those who purchase and consume it, and at the hazard of those who actually do the work of producing and handling it. The Material Safety Data Sheet on aspartame (CAS# 22839-47-0) says that to work with the sweetener, one should wear chemical goggles, protective gloves to prevent skin exposure, a chemical apron and a NIOS/MSHA approved air purifying dust or mist respirator.16 Whatever else one may say about refined white sugar, at least one doesn\u2019t have to wear chemical goggles to work with it!\nProblems associated with aspartame consumption are neatly summarized in Nourishing Traditions. \"Aspartame. . . is a neurotoxic substance that has been associated with numerous health problems including dizziness, visual impairment, severe muscle aches, numbing of extremities, pancreatitis, high blood pressure, retinal hemorrhaging, seizures and depression. It is suspected of causing birth defects and chemical disruptions in the brain.\n\"Researchers at Utah State University found that even at low levels aspartame induces adverse changes in the pituitary glands of mice. The pituitary gland is the master gland upon which the proper function of all biochemical processes depend.\n\" When aspartame is digested it breaks down into the amino acids phenylalanine and aspartic acid, plus methanol. Methanol, or wood alcohol, is a known poison. Methanol is also found in fruit juices, and our regulatory agencies have seized upon this fact to assure us that the methanol by-product of aspartame is not harmful. They fail to point out that the methanol content of a diet soft drink is 15 to 100 times higher than that of fruit juices.\"17\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines the \"safe consumption level\" of methanol at 7.8 milligrams per day. One liter of a beverage sweetened with aspartame may contain as much as 56 milligrams of methanol.18 Other sources also link aspartame consumption with Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and the Gulf War Syndrome experienced by U.S. soldiers after serving in Iraq during Operation: Desert Storm.19\nAccording to Dr. Christine Lydon, an accomplished aspartame researcher: \"Aspartame\u2019s breakdown products, or metabolites, are even scarier than its components. Phenylalanine decomposes into diketopiperazine (DKP) a known carcinogen, when exposed to warm temperatures or prolonged storage. Even if products are consistently kept at cooler temperatures we are not safe. At cold temperatures, methanol will spontaneously give rise to a colorless toxin known as formaldehyde. Independent studies have shown formaldehyde formation, resulting from aspartame ingestion, to be extremely common. It accumulates within the cells, and reacts with cellular proteins such as enzymes and DNA. This cumulative reaction could spell grave consequences for those who consume aspartame-laden diet drinks and foods on a daily basis.\"20\nSupporters of aspartame claim that the levels of methanol are not high enough to be worrisome and that phenylalanine and aspartic acid are of only limited concern. But there is no argument about the fact that phenylalanine, the largest component of aspartame by weight, is a danger to people who have a hereditary condition called phenylketonuria (PKU). These people must monitor or eliminate their intake of phenylalanine, which also occurs naturally in certain foods. The FDA recommends that pregnant and lactating women, people with advanced liver disease and phenylketonurics avoid products containing aspartame due to concern over metabolizing phenylalanine. The FDA also admits that aspartic acid has the potential to cause brain damage at very high doses, but they assure us that \"under normal intake levels, the brain\u2019s mechanism for controlling aspartic acid levels ensures no adverse effects.\"21\nThis dismissal of phenylalanine and aspartic acid as significant health hazards is a dangerous bit of sleight of hand. According to Dr. Lydon, \"Phenylalanine and aspartic acid are amino acids that are normally supplied by the foods we eat; however, they can only be considered natural and harmless when consumed in combination with other amino acids. On their own, they enter the central nervous system in abnormally high concentrations, causing aberrant neuronal firing and potential cell death. The neurotoxic effects of these amino acids, when consumed as isolates, can be linked to headaches, mental confusion, balance problems and possibly seizures.\"22\nWhile aspartame has been the subject of hundreds of FDA-approved studies, they clearly have not laid to rest the controversy surrounding its safety. Any adverse reaction to a food item that is regulated under the FDA\u2019s authority is supposed to be reported back to their Adverse Reaction Monitoring System (ARMS). As of 1995, over 75 percent of the adverse reactions reported to the ARMS were due to aspartame.23 A 1995 report from the US Department of Health and Human Services entitled \"Symptoms Attributed to Aspartame in Complaints Submitted to the FDA\" (which once again had to be forced into public light through the Freedom of Information Act) lists 92 separate categories of symptoms, including the frequency of each reported claim.24\nSaccharin\nSaccharin, the first artificial sweetener to be discovered, is chemically classified as an O-toluene sulfonamide derivative.25 It was originally synthesized from toluene, a colorless liquid hydrocarbon distilled from coal tar, which may account for saccharin\u2019s bitter, metallic aftertaste. Toluene is also used in the manufacture of certain dyes, pharmaceutical drugs and trinitrotoluene, the blasting agent more commonly known as TNT.26 Saccharin is currently manufactured by a more cost-effective method, beginning with synthetically produced methyl anthranilate, a compound that also occurs naturally in grape and other fruit juices. Saccharin may be found in ingredient lists under three slightly variant forms--acid saccharin, sodium saccharin and calcium saccharin.27\nUnlike aspartame, saccharin is not metabolized by the human body and is excreted rapidly through the urine.28 This is the holy grail of the artificial sweetener industry--compounds that taste sweet, are stable in prepackaged foods and beverages, and which are so foreign to the human diet that our digestive system cannot metabolize them to create any dietary calories. (Of course it is also helpful for the compounds to be dirt cheap to produce in bulk.)\nSaccharin was discovered in 1879 by Constantine Fahlberg, a chemistry research assistant working in the laboratory of Professor Ira Remsen at Johns Hopkins University.29 According to Fahlberg\u2019s account, he accidentally spilled some laboratory material on his hand and noticed the sweet taste later in the evening when he was eating dinner. (Don\u2019t these scientists wash their hands after a hard day at the lab?) Fahlberg and Remsen published their findings jointly, naming the compound saccharin after the Latin saccharum, which means sugar.30 What poetic justice for the name of the first artificial sweetener. All one has to do is add an \"e\" to the end of the word to change it to \"saccharine,\" an adjective which means \"sickeningly sweet.\"\nDespite the fact that it is 300 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar),31 saccharin was not initially used as a sweetener. From its discovery in 1879 until 1917, saccharin was primarily employed as an antiseptic agent and food preservative.32 Fahlberg, an experienced sugar chemist, did recognize the potential of the new compound for sweetening purposes, and he aggressively attempted to profit on these capabilities as early as 1885. He obtained a US patent on the new substance without crediting Professor Remsen\u2019s role in its discovery or even seeking Remsen\u2019s consent, and then proceeded to open a small plant in New York to manufacture saccharin in bulk. Fahlberg later applied for and received German patents on saccharin and moved his operation to Westerhusen, Germany. By 1902, his new product was causing nervousness in the German sugar industry. Largely at the insistence of these sugar producers, the German government enacted new laws which made saccharin available only to pharmacies for use in prescription medicines.33\nMeanwhile, a St. Louis company by the name of Meyer Brothers Drug Company had been importing saccharin from Germany, and an enterprising young employee by the name of John F. Queeny immediately recognized the sweetener\u2019s great potential. In 1901, Queeny cashed in his personal savings and took out a loan to found a new corporation for the sole purpose of producing its own saccharin for the US market. That corporation was Monsanto. In 1903, the Monsanto corporation began to ship saccharin to a little-known company in Georgia called Coca-Cola. The rest, as they say, is history.34,35\nSaccharin\u2019s early history in the US was somewhat rocky. Critics derided the substance as having no nutritional value and (ironically enough) no calories, and some people doubted that the new sweetener was safe. Theodore Roosevelt, president at the time, eloquently defended saccharin\u2019s safety by saying, \"Anybody who says saccharin is injurious to health is an idiot.\"36 Despite these stirring words of reassurance, some stubborn people remained unconvinced.\nIn 1912, saccharin was briefly banned in the US due to concerns about its safety. This ban was lifted 5 years later with the advent of the First World War.37 As so frequently happens when a nation has to buckle down for a protracted war, resources in the US had to be rationed in order to provide for the troops abroad. One of those resources was table sugar. As more and more US sugar was being sent across the ocean to the soldiers in Europe, the sweetening needs of the populace at home were met with cheap and plentiful saccharin.\nBy the time the war ended, America and its European allies had grown quite fond of the new sweetener. Usage of saccharin leveled off when sugar became available once again, but it had entered the scene to stay. World War II again brought sugar rationing and a dramatic increase in saccharin usage, which this time did not decline with the war\u2019s end.38 However, during that period, saccharin took on second-place status as cyclamate, another artificial sweetener discovered in 1937, came on the scene.39\nIn 1958, Marvin Eisenstadt, owner of Cumberland Packing Company in Brooklyn, NY, introduced Sweet\u2018n Low, which mixed saccharine with cyclamate (to counter the metallic aftertaste of saccharin) in the small packet form that we still know today. The present formula has abandoned the cyclamate, but the main ingredient is still saccharin.40\nDuring this entire period of saccharin\u2019s history, the FDA allowed the makers of saccharin (and cyclamate) to determine for themselves whether it was a safe product for human consumption.41 Indeed, the FDA showed very little interest in saccharin until 1969, when researchers discovered that cyclamate was carcinogenic in laboratory mice. Cyclamate was banned by the FDA that same year.42 The FDA proposed also banning saccharin until conclusive tests could prove its safety. This suggestion was met with significant opposition from a public which had become greatly enamored with the concept of artificial sweeteners and had just lost their only other option at the time, cyclamate.\nIn 1977, Canadian scientists found that high doses of saccharin seemed to cause cancer in laboratory rats. The Canadian government responded by immediately banning all use of saccharin in food and beverages.43 To forestall a possible FDA ban on the popular sweetener, Congress passed the Saccharin Study and Labeling Act. This Act placed a two-year moratorium on any ban of saccharin, allowing for further testing to be done, and also mandated that all products containing saccharin carry the following cautionary label: \"Use of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals.\"44\nDuring the ensuring 26 years, the FDA and other groups performed numerous studies attempting to determine conclusively whether or not saccharin was a carcinogen. Meanwhile, the public at large continued to gobble up saccharin-containing products, and every time the moratorium on banning saccharin expired, Congress extended it until more research could be done. The moratorium was extended seven times, until 1991 when the FDA decided it was no longer suspicious of saccharin as a serious threat.45 Technically, ever since that time the FDA has given saccharin something of a probationary status, allowing it equal footing with the other three non-nutritive sweeteners but still classifying it as an \"anticipated human carcinogen,\"46 whatever that means.\nThere is also another, lesser-studied concern with saccharin due to the fact that it is a sulfonamide. (Remember, chemically speaking saccharin is called an O-toluene sulfonamide derivative.) Sulfonamide compounds have been shown to cause dermatological reactions in those who are allergic to sulfa drugs, especially in children. Consumption of saccharin by these sensitive individuals may result in pruritus (itching), urticaria (blotchy skin discolorations), eczema, photosensitivity, prurigo (a condition characterized by small, intensely itchy skin bumps), wheezing, nausea, diarrhea, tongue blisters, tachycardia, fixed eruptions, headache, diuresis (increased urination) or sensory neuropathy.47 Also, regardless of sulfa allergies, consumption of saccharin-sweetened infant formula has been associated with irritability, hypertonia (abnormal increase in muscle tension with reduced muscle elasticity), insomnia, opisthotonos (an abnormal posturing condition characterized by rigidity and severe arching of the back) and strabismus (a condition in which the eyes uncontrollably deviate from the intended object of focus). These conditions generally resolve themselves within 36 hours after ingestion of the formula.48 (This last bit is most likely an unnecessary warning for readers of Wise Traditions. There is nary a commercial infant formula out there which is truly healthful, whether or not it contains saccharin.)\nSo where does this leave the matter? Saccharin is the most thoroughly tested of all the non-nutritive sweeteners--more than 2374 studies have been done, with aspartame coming in second at 598.49 Even the most staunch critics are left to admit that no one has been able to draw a definite link between saccharin consumption (even at high levels) and cancer in humans. It has been shown that saccharin causes bladder cancer in male rats of a certain genetic predisposition, but this appears to be a gender- and species-specific phenomenon. To quote from Dr. Janet Starr Hull: \"Saccharin is not genotoxic; the presumed mechanism of toxicity is the binding of saccharin to urinary proteins (not normally found in humans), creating a nidus for the formation of silicate crystals, which are cytotoxic to bladder epithelium (of rats).\"50 However--and this is the important part--while the FDA has chosen to say that it cannot be proven that saccharin\u2019s effect on mice is relevant to humans, one could just as easily say that the studies have failed to prove that there is no link between saccharin and bladder cancer in humans.\nAcesulfame-K\nThe third of our non-nutritive sweeteners is acesulfame-K, also referred to as acesulfame potassium (K is the chemical symbol for potassium), potassium acesulfame, ace-K or ACK. Any of these names are greatly preferable to the chemical name of the product--5,6-dimethyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3H)-one-2,2-dioxide. We\u2019ll stick with acesulfame K for our purposes!\nCompared to aspartame and saccharin, there is very little information available about acesulfame-K. It is 200 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar)51 and, as it is not metabolized by the body, it is excreted unchanged in the urine.52 It was discovered in 1967 by a German chemist, Karl Clauss, who was working with derivatives of acetoacetic acid.53 In what should now be a familiar theme, the sweetness of one particular derivative revealed itself one day when he licked his finger to pick up a piece of paper.54\nAt the time, Mr. Clauss was employed at a German chemical company by the name of the Hoechst Group. Immediately grasping the potential for a new artificial sweetener, Hoechst conducted its own safety testing on the compound throughout the 1970s. As soon as they were satisfied with the results of their testing, Hoechst began to market their new product around the world. Currently, more than 100 countries allow the use of acesulfame-K.55,56\nThe entry of the new sweetener into the U.S. began in 1988 when, based largely upon acceptance of Hoechst\u2019s own research, the FDA gave a partial green light for its use as a tabletop sweetener and as an ingredient in baked goods, frozen desserts, alcoholic beverages and candies.57 In September of 1997, Hoechst established a subsidiary corporation called Nutrinova Nutrition Specialties & Food Ingredients, in part to handle the growing business of acesulfame K, marketed under the brand name Sunett.58 It has also been sold under the names Sweet One, Swiss Sweet and Sweet & Safe.\nWhile the general popularity of acesulfame-K was on the rise, a few voices began to raise questions. After reviewing the data provided by Hoechst\u2019s product safety tests, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) concluded that the company had not done an adequate job with the testing and had ignored problematic data.\nTo quote from the CSPI website: \"The safety tests of acesulfame-K were. . . of mediocre quality. Key rat tests were afflicted by disease in the animal colonies; a mouse study was several months too brief and did not expose animals during gestation. Two rat studies suggest that the additive might cause cancer. . . In addition, large doses of acetoacetamide, a breakdown product, have been shown to affect the thyroid in rats, rabbits and dogs.\"59 CSPI has also gone on record as saying that the Hoechst scientists \"followed inadequate protocols, which are greatly at variance with current standards for test design, execution and reporting required for the National Toxicology Program\u2019s bioassays.\"60 It has also been noted that acesulfame-K stimulates insulin secretion in a dose dependent fashion, thereby possibly aggravating reactive hypoglycemia (\"low blood sugar attacks\").61\nBased on these objections, in 1996 CSPI urged the FDA to reconsider its position on the new sweetener, but two years later the FDA approved acesulfame-K for all other general sweetening purposes, including non-alcoholic liquid use. As soon as it was approved, Pepsi announced that it would be used in a new drink, Pepsi One.62\nSince 1995, there has also been another product available, marketed by the Holland Sweetener Company as Twinsweet. While acesulfame-K is frequently blended with aspartame to achieve synergistic sweetening capabilities, Twinsweet is actually a blend of the two at the molecular level. This is possible due to the fact that some high-intensity sweeteners form positively charged ions in certain solutions, whereas others form negatively charged ions. Aspartame and acesulfame-K are the first two sweeteners which have been successfully bonded in this way to form what is known as a \"sweetener-sweetener salt.\" This solves certain difficulties that the food industry encounters when trying to mechanically blend sweeteners. Twinsweet dissolves in water into separated molecules of the two individual components, so all the safety concerns of aspartame and acesulfame-K should be applied as well to Twinsweet.63\nIn spite of the FDA go-ahead, CSPI and a handful of independent scientists maintain their objections to acesulfame-K, citing inadequate testing and the fact that previous tests suggest serious problems, including possible carcinogenicity. While there may not be any organized groups at this time compiling lists of adverse reactions or calling public attention to the possibilities of danger, this does not necessarily indicate that this compound presents no danger. Since no specific monitoring practices or epidemiological studies of acesulfame-K are currently in progress, it is possible that relevant data may not be gathered for some time. The FDA has no apparent interest in pressing the issue. As with saccharin, the prudent consumer would be wise to seek out better options.\nSucralose\nThe fourth FDA-approved non-nutritive sweetener is sucralose, chemically known as 1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-BETA-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranoside.64 Sucralose may have the strangest \"accidental discovery\" story of all. In 1976, a British sugar company by the name of Tate & Lyle was conducting experiments in collaboration with Queen Elizabeth College at the University of London, searching for ways to use sucrose as a chemical intermediate. Shashikant Phadnis, a foreign graduate student working on the project, misunderstood a request for \"testing\" of a chlorinated sugar as a request for \"tasting,\" leading to the discovery that many chlorinated sugars are hundreds or thousands of times sweeter than sucrose.65\nFollowing this discovery, Tate & Lyle arranged with Johnson & Johnson, then the world\u2019s largest health care company, to develop and test a new sweetener from chlorinated sugars. In 1980, Johnson & Johnson formed a subsidiary company by the name of McNeil Specialty Products for this purpose.66 The product they created, at an impressive 600 times sweeter than sucrose, would be known as sucralose and marketed as Splenda.\nCanada became the first nation to approve sucralose in 1991,67 soon to be followed by many more. Currently, more than 40 nations have given their approval to sucralose, although a number of European nations still have it under preliminary review.68,69,70 The new product made a grand entrance into the US market with FDA approval in 1998. Even though this was not full FDA approval, to quote Splenda\u2019s own website, the product was \"approved for use in 15 food and beverage categories, the broadest initial approval ever given to a no-calorie sweetener.\" It was only 16 months later in 1999 when the FDA finished the job and gave full approval for all sweetening purposes.71\nAccording to the Splenda website, \"sucralose, is made from sugar through a patented, multi-step process that selectively replaces three hydrogen-oxygen groups on the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms. The result is an exceptionally stable sweetener that tastes like sugar, but without sugar\u2019s calories. After consumption, sucralose passes through the body without being broken down.\"72 Sucralose is also said to be diabetic-safe, as it does not increase blood sugar levels. However, some researchers dispute these claims.\nWhile the Johnson & Johnson Corporation claims that they have hundreds of self-conducted studies demonstrating the product\u2019s safety, sucralose has the fewest independent scientific tests to its credit of all non-nutritive sweeteners. Additionally, independent reviewers of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s tests have found them to be inadequate and methodologically flawed. Flaws notwithstanding, several pre-approval tests still indicated potential toxicity, although this was written off by the company as insignificant. Similar to the situation with aspartame after it first entered the market, there are currently no independent, long-term studies on the effects of sucralose consumption.73\nOf the few human studies which have been conducted, one focusing on diabetics using sucralose showed \"a statistically significant increase in glycosylated hemoglobin (Hba1C), which is a marker of long-term blood glucose levels and is used to assess glycemic control in diabetic patients.\" The FDA itself has stated that \"increases in glycosolation in hemoglobin imply lessening of control in diabetes.\"74\nIt is not only diabetics who need worry about the safety of sucralose. Research conducted with rats, mice and rabbits has shown that sucralose consumption can cause shrinking of the thymus gland (up to 40 percent shrinkage), enlargement of the liver and kidneys, atrophy of lymph follicles in the spleen and thymus, increased cecal weight, reduced bodily growth rate, decreased red blood cell count, hyperplasia of the pelvis, extension of gestational periods in pregnancy, decreased fetal body weights and placental weights, and diarrhea. According to the FDA\u2019s \"Final Rule\" report on sucralose, it was considered to be \"weakly mutagenic in a mouse lymphoma mutation assay.\"75\nThe reason for this host of side effects is not fully understood. Many detractors have raised concerns due to the fact that sucralose is a chlorinated molecule. Chlorinated molecules, which are used as the basis for pesticides such as DDT, tend to accumulate in body tissues. Johnson & Johnson maintains that sucralose passes through the digestive system without any absorption or metabolization, but the FDA\u2019s own research has shown that 11 to 27 percent of sucralose is absorbed in humans, while the rest is excreted unchanged in the feces. Tests performed by the Japanese Food Sanitation Council have found that as much as 40 percent of ingested sucralose is absorbed. To further dispute the manufacturer\u2019s claims, research indicates that about 20 to 30 percent of the absorbed sucralose is metabolized. Both the metabolites and unchanged absorbed sucralose are excreted in urine, but some absorbed sucralose has been found to concentrate in the liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract.76\nNot only does sucralose break down within the digestive system, but, as the FDA notes, \"[it] may hydrolyze in some food products\u2026[and] the resulting hydrolysis products may also be ingested by the consumer.\" Prolonged storage, particularly at high temperatures and low pH, causes sucralose to break down into other chemicals, including 4-chloro-4-deoxy-galactose, 1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-fructose and 1,6-dichlorofructose, none of which has ever specifically been tested in terms of safety for human ingestion. Additionally, as the FDA again acknowledges, sucralose may contain up to 2 percent of various impurities, such as heavy metals, arsenic, triphenilphosphine oxide, methanol, chlorinated disaccharides and chlorinated monosaccharides. Even if these \"impurities\" are within existing manufacturing guidelines, they are still all potentially dangerous to human health.77\nSucralose production and consumption may also pose a threat to the environment in general. To quote from Dr. Joseph Mercola\u2019s website ( www.mercola.com/2000/dec/3/sucralose_dangers.htm ): \"Although sucralose is being flushed down toilets [after human excretion]. . . , what happens to it next is simply a matter for speculation. I know of no studies showing what happens to the chemical when the raw sewage is treated and then released back into the environment. Does it remain stabile or react with other substances to form new compounds? Is the sucralose or any resulting chemicals safe for the environment? How will this chemical affect aquatic life such as fish, as well as other animals? Will sucralose begin to appear in our water supplies, just as some drugs [such as antibiotics] are beginning to be found? . . . [Ultimately] the ecological impact of this new chemical being introduced into the environment is unknown.\"\nThis additional consideration of environmental impact should also be applied to the other non-nutritive sweeteners, as well as all synthetic foods and additives. The burden of proving that such synthetic compounds are safe, from the process of their creation through the human digestive system and into our environment, should fall upon the purveyors of these chemicals.\nWhile no formal lists currently exist to catalogue adverse reactions to sucralose consumption, Dr. Mercola provides several anecdotal incidents on his website. Clearly, sucralose consumption poses potential hazards which have not been sufficiently acknowledged or studied. This author recommends against willingly acting as a guinea pig for yet another questionable product--read on for better options later in this article.\nNeotame\nNeotame, another product of Monsanto\u2019s Nutrasweet Company and also the most recently approved sweetener, deserves several red flags of caution. Also known as \"superaspartame,\" it was first synthesized from a base of aspartame and 3,3-dimethylbutyraldehyde by French scientists Claude Nofre and Jean-Marie Tinti. In an amazing display of sweetening power, neotame hits the scales at 8000 times sweeter than sucrose, and its chemical name is a mouthful--N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester.\nAmazingly, neotame doesn\u2019t even come close to being the sweetest compound that Nofre and Tinti synthesized. Of their numerous other discoveries, carrelame, bernadame, sucrononate and lugduname are the sweetest substances known to man, ranging from 150,000 to over 220,000 times sweeter than sucrose! There are currently no plans to seek approval of these substances for human consumption, but they may at some point be utilized in other ways and thereby find their way into the food chain.78\nThe chemical formula of neotame, published in the February 10, 1998 Federal Register, reveals that neotame is extremely similar to aspartame. Essentially, neotame molecules are aspartame molecules chemically combined with a neohexyl group. While neotame has not yet been introduced into any markets, critics surmise that all of the toxic effects of aspartame and more will plague consumers of neotame. NutraSweet petitioned the FDA in 1997 and received final approval for a wide variety of sweetening purposes in 2002.\nIn May of 2000, the NutraSweet Company was purchased from Monsanto by the J.W. Childs Equity Partners, LP.79 The new leadership at NutraSweet must be quite excited about the approval of neotame, as the patent rights on aspartame expired in the 1990s and generic versions have been allowed ever since. It is estimated that neotame could replace up to 50 percent of the current market share for aspartame. We will all see soon enough how neotame is received by the public.80,81,82\nAs a concluding remark on all five of the FDA-approved non-nutritive sweeteners, it should be noted that many animal studies on these products only yield negative results when test animals are fed the equivalent of several hundred artificially sweetened products daily. Apologists for non-nutritive sweeteners point to this as a way of dismissing negative test data.\nA quotation from the Holistic Healing website explains the fallacy of this assertion. \"In order to estimate a potential safe dose [of a chemical] in humans, one must divide the lowest dose given to rodents that was seen to have any negative effects. . . by 100. That dose is then known as the maximum Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for lifetime use. Keep in mind that the TDI is just an estimate. Some chemicals are much more than 10 times more toxic in humans than in rodents (or will cause cancer in humans in low-dose, long-term exposure and do not cause cancer in rodents at all). A person ingesting the TDI for some chemical may find that it causes cancer, or immune system or neurological problems, after many years or decades of use. So, if the manufacturer claims that the dose was equivalent to 50 diet sodas, then the TDI would be one-half (1/2) of a diet soda, and even that dose may or may not be safe.\"83\nCyclamate\nAside from the five current non-nutritive sweeteners, there are two additional non-nutritive sweeteners under review by the FDA--cyclamate and alitame. Since it is entirely likely that both of them will all be approved at some point in the future, they must be considered as well.\nCyclamate was discovered in 1937 by Michael Sveda, a graduate student at the University of Illinois, working on the synthesis of anti-pyretic (anti-fever) drugs. The familiar theme continues: Sveda noticed the sweet taste of a compound he was working with after he accidentally sat his cigarette down in some of it and then took a puff.84 As word got out about the discovery of what was then only the second existing artificial sweetener, DuPont quickly bought the patent, and then later sold it to Abbott Laboratories. Abbott reportedly wished to use the new product to mask the bitter taste of certain antibiotics and medications.85\nIn the early 1950s, Abbott began to market cyclamate tablets as diabetic-friendly sweeteners. As noted above in the history of saccharin, cyclamate was also a part of the original \"formula\" of Sweet\u2019n Low, introduced to the public in 1958. Cyclamate enjoyed a great deal of controversy-free popularity from this time until the late 1960s, when laboratory tests began to suggest that it caused genetic damage, testicular atrophy and cancer in rats. In 1970, the FDA imposed a total ban on the use of cyclamate within the U.S. However, it is still used in 50 countries around the world--the major producers and exporters are located in China, Indonesia, Taiwan and Spain86--so it almost certainly still finds its way into the US via products from these countries. Where it is still used, cyclamate is frequently blended with aspartame and acesulfame-K to make a \"super sweetener.\"87\nAfter the US cyclamate ban, would-be producers were legally obligated to prove its safety to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction if it was to be re-approved. Abbott has been hard at work ever since 1970, petitioning the FDA for re-approval in 1973, 1976 and 1982, and also requesting special hearings on the matter in 1977 and \u201978. No substantial ground was gained until 1985, when the Cancer Assessment Committee of FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition concluded that cyclamate is not a carcinogen. It has still not been satisfactorily resolved whether or not cyclamate is a co-carcinogen with other substances or promotes tumor growth, and thus it is still pending re-approval.88\nAlitame\nOf alitame, there is very little to report. Developed by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, alitame is sold under the name Aclame in several countries, including Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, China, Indonesia, Colombia and Chile.89 Similar to aspartame, alitame is composed of amino acids, including L-aspartic acid, D-alanine and 2,2,4,4-tetramethylthietanyl amine.90 It is a heat-stable compound, 2000 times sweeter than sucrose, which could potentially be incorporated into any sweetened product. Pfizer applied for FDA approval of alitame in 1986, but has yet to receive a conclusive ruling.91 Any sweetener that may be described as \"similar to aspartame\" deserves a red flag of caution, but no commentary of any detail is readily available at the present time. One source claims that alitame will soon be approved as a sweetener in the US, marketed under the name Novasweet. Anticipating this, the Wrigley Company has already filed several patents to use the new sweetener in its chewing gums.92\n\"Nutritive\" Sweeteners\nHaving now dealt with all of the currently-approved and pending non-nutritive sweeteners, we must return our attention briefly to the so-called \"nutritive\" sweeteners. To deal with this category, we must first rid ourselves of the silly idea that the word \"nutritive\" necessarily indicates that a substance will contribute anything positive to our general well being. The FDA and ADA consider nutritive sweeteners to include anything from raw honey, pure maple syrup, molasses, sorghum or other nutritious options, to such dietary dead-ends as white sugar, high fructose corn syrup and concentrated fruit juices.\nThe so-called nutritive sweeteners include a class of substances known variously as sugar alcohols, polyols, polyalcohols or polyhydric acids. These are the substances which are usually, but not always, identifiable by the suffix \"-itol\"--sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, erythritol, lactitol, maltitol, isomalt and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates (HSH). Scientists call them sugar alcohols because part of their structure chemically resembles sugar and part is similar to alcohol, but they don\u2019t completely fit into either category.93 Each of these substances has its own particular history, but mercifully--for the purpose of brevity--they all share a great deal of similarity.\nAlthough several sugar alcohols are touted as naturally occurring in various foods--which is technically true--all commercially-available sugar alcohols are synthesized by the hydrogenation of sugars from various sources.94 While the author could not find any information commenting on this fact, the use of a hydrogenation process may or may not be of concern. Hydrogenation of fats and oils is certainly detrimental to the nutritive qualities of said items, but the process must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. One must keep in mind, however, that fats and oils were hydrogenated for some time before we became aware of the detrimental effects of this practice. If anyone has bothered to specifically research the effects of hydrogenating sugars, that information is not readily available at this time.\nAccording to the American Dietetics Association: \"[Sugar alcohols] can . . . be categorized as sugar replacers because they can replace sugar sweeteners, usually on a one-to-one basis; offer less energy; and offer potential health benefits, such as reduced glycemic response and reduced dental caries risk.\"98\nIt should be noted that lactitol, mannitol and some of the hydrogenated starch hydrolysates have less than half of the sweetening power of sucrose, and for this reason are usually employed for other purposes. Mannitol is frequently used as a dusting agent on chewing gum, intended to prevent the gum from sticking to the wrapper. Sweeteners from the HSH family commonly serve as viscosity or bodifying agents, humectants, crystallization modifiers, cryoprotectants, and rehydration aids. Lactitol frequently finds its way into blends with more potent sweeteners, such as aspartame, saccharin and acesulfame-K. Whatever their intended usage, all of the sugar alcohols are touted as being safe for diabetics and hypoglycemics, lower in calories than sugar, and non-contributory towards tooth decay and the growth of intestinal yeasts.\nXylitol has the additional claims of increasing absorption of B-vitamins and calcium, re-mineralizing tooth enamel and fighting/preventing ear infections,99 as well as possibly contributing to fresher breath, greater athletic performance, and recovery from sinus infections.100 It also takes the prize as the sweetener with the most bizarre application--a Japanese company recently began to market a line of women\u2019s t-shirts with xylitol infused into the fabric. Xylitol, like several other sugar alcohols, exhibits a cooling effect in the mouth. The t-shirts are intended to utilize this same property to keep a person cooler in warm weather.101\nIt is interesting to note that even the manufacturers and the official regulatory bodies hint at the potential problems with sugar alcohols. According to the ADA website: \"All [sugar alcohols] are absorbed slowly and incompletely from the intestine by passive diffusion. Therefore, an excessive load (e.g., greater than 50 g sorbitol per day, greater than 20 g mannitol per day) may cause diarrhea. . . . [I]ncomplete absorption causes indirect metabolism of [sugar alcohols] via fermentive (sic) degradation by the intestinal flora. The energy return from indirect metabolism is less than the direct route; thus, [sugar alcohols] are referred to as reduced-energy or low-energy sweeteners. [The] FDA allows these nutritive sweeteners to be labeled as having fewer kilocalories per gram than other nutritive sweeteners. . . . Products with sorbitol and mannitol may have the following statement on the label because high intakes increase the risk of malabsorption: \u2018excess consumption may have a laxative effect.\u2019\"102\nThe ADA description hints at more than it actually says. Sugar alcohols are not broken down in the stomach, so they make their way intact into the bowels. It is here in the bowels that the \"passive diffusion\" mentioned by the ADA takes place, meaning that the presence of the sugar alcohols draws water into the bowels. This leads to the fermentation by undesirable bacteria and a resultant partial degradation or \"metabolism\" of the sugar alcohols. (This fermentation of intestinal bacteria can lead to or exacerbate problems with candida and other yeast problems.) The direct result of this chain of events is the severe stomach cramping and diarrhea that many people experience after ingesting too much sugar alcohol. So how much is too much? The above quotation lists the official, generally agreed upon thresholds for sorbitol and mannitol, but each sugar alcohol has its own threshold. However, certain individuals have been known to experience reactions at much lower dosages. Lactitol in particular may be problematic in small doses, especially for lactose-sensitive individuals.103,104\nStomach cramping and diarrhea are certainly not as serious as the conditions associated with some of the non-nutritive sweeteners, but the sugar alcohols can cause other more serious problems. One of these conditions is metabolic acidosis, which can lead to acid reflux and an increased risk of cancer of the larynx. And diabetics and hypoglycemics should be aware that sugar alcohols do raise blood sugar levels, although not as much as sugar. Sugar alcohols also promote dehydration and loss of electrolytes, creating feelings of excessive thirst. This is a potential concern to those who consume a lot of low-carb, energy bar types of foods. Exercising after consuming these types of products may put one at risk for heat stroke, muscle cramping and cardiovascular problems. Those who are trying to avoid carbohydrates and burn body fat should also know that sugar alcohols will immediately take the body out of ketosis, the state wherein fat reserves rather than dietary calories are being metabolized. . . assuming that the body was in a state of ketosis to begin with.\nAdditional concerns with sugar alcohols stem from the fact that they seem to increase the frequency of seizures in epileptics, and children are especially sensitive to the gastrointestinal side effects, possibly due to their propensity for bingeing on sweet foods. Children who regularly consume sugar alcohols also seem to have an increased incidence of childhood obesity.105\nThe final word on sugar alcohols as a group seems to be a mixed message. The evidence does seem to support the positive claims made on behalf of these sweeteners, and perhaps this gives them a valid place in certain applications. For example, given the choice between treating a child\u2019s ear infection with a course of antibiotics or with administration of a therapeutic dose of xylitol, the latter option would certainly be preferable. Of course, there may be even better options.\nWhile sugar alcohols may indeed occur in nature, their usage as sweeteners also suffers from the same problem as many other sweeteners, pharmaceutical drugs and other substances today--one single factor from a natural food item is being isolated from its normal co-constituents and consumed at levels that are difficult to obtain when eating the food item itself. Rarely, if ever, does this situation lend itself to good health. While sugar alcohols are certainly the lesser of two evils when compared to the non-nutritive sweeteners, they should be consumed with prudence if at all. There are better choices.\nSugar Alcohols\nThe eight categories of sugar alcohols may be subdivided into mono-, di- and polysaccharides.\nMONOSACCHARIDES include sorbitol (derived from glucose, 50 percent to 70 percent as sweet as sucrose, GRAS status), xylitol (derived from xylan, a substance found in the bark of birch trees, equally sweet as sucrose, GRAS status), mannitol (derived from glucose syrups, 50 percent to 70 percent as sweet as sucrose, permitted for limited use on an interim basis by the FDA) and erythritol (derived from corn products,95 70 percent as sweet as sucrose, GRAS status).\nDISACCHARIDES include lactitol (derived from lactose, 30 percent to 40 percent as sweet as sucrose, GRAS status), maltitol (derived from maltose, 90 percent as sweet as sucrose, GRAS status) and isomalt (derived from enzymatically-treated sucrose, 45 percent to 65 percent as sweet as sucrose, GRAS status).\nPOLYSACCHARIDES refers to a family of sweeteners including hydrogenated glucose syrups, maltitol syrups and sorbitol syrups, often called \"hydrogenated starch hydrolysates\" because they are produced by the partial hydrolysis of corn, wheat or potato starch and subsequent hydrogenation at high temperatures and pressure. By varying this manufacturing process, different end products may be created to meet different requirements of the food processing industry. When the final product contains 50 percent or more of hydrogenated glucose, it is called a hydrogenated glucose syrup. If the final product has 50 percent or more of maltitol or sorbitol, it is named accordingly as either a maltitol syrup or sorbitol syrup. Some of the end products do not contain a specific sugar alcohol in any clear majority; these are simply referred to by the generalized term--hydrogenated starch hydrolysate. This term, or the abbreviation \"HSH,\" may correctly be applied to any of these products. All HSH products have a GRAS status and are variously from 25 percent to 50 percent as sweet as sucrose.96,97\nOther Sweeteners\nHaving reviewed all of the non-nutritive sweeteners and the sugar alcohols, we enter into the murky, little-known world of \"what else is out there.\" There are a number of additional substances that defy clear inclusion into the previously discussed categories. Some of the remaining sweeteners are not classified by the FDA as being sweeteners at all, yet they undeniably possess some degree of sweetness. To generalize, all of these substances share a relatively limited degree of market share, name recognition, general availability and usage by the food industry or at-home consumers, but they are still worth reviewing. Any one of them just may turn up on a product label one day, and having some knowledge of what a substance is may help each of us to make informed purchases. Some additional sweeteners are tagalose, trehalose and neohesperidin dihyrochalcone (NHDC).\nTagatose\nTagatose, known scientifically as D-tagatose, is very new to the sweetening scene and there is comparatively little to be said about it. It was discovered in 1988 by scientists working for a Beltsville, Maryland corporation called Biospherics (the company name has since been changed to Spherix). Tagatose is 92 percent as sweet as sucrose and is said to occur \"naturally\" in heated cow\u2019s milk and some other presumably heat-treated dairy products. . . so it seems that tagatose only occurs \"in nature\" to the same extent that heat-treated dairy products occur \"in nature.\" It is formed as a result of changes to lactose as heat is applied. Commercially available tagatose is synthetically produced from whey.\nTagatose has the exact same chemical formula as ordinary fructose, but the molecular structures of the two are slightly different. The difference is virtually irrelevant to your tongue, but the digestive system has no idea how to handle this unnatural molecule, just as the body cannot properly assimilate many synthetic vitamins, which are mirror images of their natural counterparts. This may be why consumption of tagatose in large amounts reportedly causes gastrointestinal distress, including diarrhea, nausea and flatulence. Only about 20 percent of ingested tagatose is absorbed, this taking place by means of metabolism in the small intestine.106\nTagatose manufacturers have presented their product as a virtual panacea, claiming that it promotes weight loss, is safe for diabetics, shows potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of type II diabetes, reduces \"spiking\" of blood glucose levels, fights plaque and halitosis, is a prebiotic (provides food for healthy intestinal bacteria), fights colon cancer, combats certain types of pathogenic bacteria and microorganisms, and raises blood levels of the \"good\" HDL-cholesterol.\nIn 1996, Spherix granted a license to Arla Foods of Denmark to produce and market the sweetener. While a few other countries had previously given a green light to tagatose, in April of 2001 the FDA accepted it as a GRAS substance for use in foods, beverages, cosmetics, toothpastes and pharmaceutical drugs. However, Spherix is currently arbitrating a legal dispute against Arla Foods concerning the new sweetener, thus delaying the entry of tagatose into the US market. It is not yet available as a commercial tabletop sweetener, and it was as recently as August 21, 2003, that 7-Eleven Inc. became the very first American company to use tagatose (marketed by Spherix as Naturlose) in a food or beverage--a Diet-Pepsi-flavored Slurpee drink. We can expect to see much more of Naturlose/tagatose in the future, as Arla Foods and Spherix are both actively promoting its use around the world.107\nTrehalose\nTrehalose, a disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules, is only 45 percent as sweet as sucrose. It is also referred to as a,a-Trehalose, mushroom sugar or mycose, but its proper chemical name is a-D-glucopyranosyl a-D-glucopyranoside. It was first identified as a constituent in the ergot of rye in 1832, even before the discovery of saccharin. (Ergot is a fungus known to afflict rye and other cereal grains and grasses.) The term \"trehalose\" was coined in later years when the same substance was identified as a component of the secretions of a beetle in the Iraqi desert. These secretions, known by native peoples to be edible and sweet, were called the \"trehala manna.\" Some people believe that this is a similar substance to the manna that was gathered and eaten by the Israelites of the Old Testament.\nTrehalose occurs naturally in a number of foods, including honey, wines, sherries, breads, lobster, crab, prawns, brine shrimp, various edible fungi (including commercially-grown mushrooms), insects, baker\u2019s yeast and brewer\u2019s yeast. As such, it has always been a part of the human diet, but has only been available as an isolated ingredient since 1995. Previously it had been too expensive to extract or produce commercially, but Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories of Okayama, Japan developed a feasible method using the action of soil microorganisms on starch. Hayashibara\u2019s trehalose is the only source currently in production, and Japan is by far the largest consumer of products containing trehalose.\nWhen trehalose is ingested, it undergoes a similar digestive process as other disaccharides; it is enzymatically broken into individual glucose molecules which the body then metabolizes. As with lactose (another disaccharide) which requires a special enzyme, lactase, to break it down, a small percentage of people are genetically prone towards deficiency in trehalase, the enzyme that metabolizes trehalose. These people may experience intestinal distress after consuming foods containing trehalose, whether they be natural sources of the sugar or not. This appears to be the only safety issue with trehalose.\nThe low level of sweetness has limited the applications of trehalose as a sweetening agent, but it has not stopped the food industry from finding other uses. Its potential applications include stabilizing proteins in dried or frozen foods, stabilizing flavors, colors and fatty acids, and maintaining the texture of food coatings. Trehalose was given GRAS status in the US in October of 2000 and is approved as a food additive in Britain, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Trehalose is not commercially available to consumers anywhere at this time.108\nNHDC\nNext on the list is neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, usually abbreviated to NHDC or neohesperidin DC. NHDC is a type of flavonoid, a broad term referring to a group of over 4000 substances known to occur naturally in all higher forms of plants. (A particularly beneficial subset of the flavonoids is the bioflavonoids, which are sometimes collectively called \"Vitamin P.\") NHDC is grouped as a flavonoid, yet it has not been discovered anywhere in a naturally-occurring state.\nIn 1963, NHDC was discovered by two researchers by the names of Horowitz and Gentili who were studying bitter compounds found in citrus fruits. After experimentally hydrogenating a particular citrus phenolic glycoside, they observed that the resultant compound was very sweet, 1500 to 1800 times sweeter than sucrose. The two then performed similar experiments on other citrus derivatives and discovered several additional sweet compounds, but it was only the original product, NHDC, which would go on to have commercial application.\nIndustry-sponsored tests did not find any safety issues with the use of NHDC, and also ruled that it does not promote cavities. NHDC does not function well as the sole sweetening agent in food items due to its slow onset of sweetness and a lingering menthol or licorice aftertaste. For these and other reasons, it has found more favor as a component of sweetener blends and as a flavor-modifying/enhancing agent. NHDC has been accorded various levels of regulatory status around the world. The European Union, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Turkey allow it to be used as a sweetener. Australia and New Zealand allow NHDC as an artificial flavoring. In the U.S., it is only allowed as a flavor ingredient (used at levels below the threshold of sweetness) in 16 food categories. NHDC is marketed world-wide under the name Citrosa by the Spanish-based Exquim, S.A. company, a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical group Ferrer Internacional, S.A.109,110,111\nHealthy Options\nClearly, most artificial sweeteners in use today pose significant dangers. Mother Nature did not intend for us to suffer from the Sugar-Free Blues. There are many healthy alternatives to both refined sugar and artificial sweeteners, including maple syrup, dehydrated sugar cane juice (sold as Sucanat and Rapadura), date sugar, raw unfiltered honey and molasses. Consumed in moderation as part of a nutrient-dense diet that includes plenty of good quality fats, these mineral-rich, naturally sweet foods allow us to enjoy the sweet taste while nourishing the body at the same time. In strict moderation, they can even be used by diabetics in conjunction with a nutrient-dense, high-fat diet.\nBetter Options--Updated 12 APR 2004\nMany healthful and promising alternative sweeteners are now available to the informed consumer; please note that most of the good options are provided to us by plants and herbs, while most of the bad options have been created in laboratories.\nFrom this point on (beginning with thaumatin) is what the author likes to term as \"the best options,\" although not all of them are readily available options at this time for various reasons. This section has been updated from what originally appeared in the print edition of Wise Traditions, Winter 2003. Note that reference numbers in this section correspond to the \"References Corresponding to Better Options Addendum\" list following the original references.\nThaumatin\nThaumatin is a naturally-occurring sweet protein (not a carbohydrate at all) derived from the berries of the West African Katemfe plant, also called the sweet prayer plant and the miracle plant, botanically known as Thaumatococcus daniellii. More correctly, there are five separate sweet proteins which may be isolated and derived from Katemfe berries--thaumatins I, II, III, a and b. These five are collectively referred to as thaumatin in a generalized sense. Thaumatin is metabolized by the human body similarly as other proteins.\nThe Katemfe plant was first \"discovered\" by the Western world by a British Army Surgeon, W. F. Daniell, during his army posting in West Africa in the 1840s. He observed that the local people used it \"to improve sour fruit and bad palm wine.\" He wrote of the fruit's \"extraordinary power on the palate,\" and clearly identified its capabilities \"to enhance flavours and mask off-notes.\"112 The actual proteins responsible for the sweetness were first isolated from the plant and identified in 1971 by H. van der Wel. They were found to be 3000 times sweeter than sucrose, thus making thaumatin the sweetest natural substance known to man.113 (Thaumatin also has the unusual distinction of having been selected by NASA to be synthesized in a space lab orbiting the Earth. They chose it due to the fact that thaumatin molecules have a very unusual crystalline structure, suitable to the research that NASA was doing at the time.)114\nImmediately grasping upon the potential of this newly-identified sweetener, the British sugar multinational Tate & Lyle established massive Katemfe plantations in Ghana, Liberia and Malaysia in the 1970s. The berries were frozen and shipped to its factories in the UK. The food industry, in their never-ending quest to increase their profits and jeopardize the safety of our foods, later found a way to use genetic engineering and gene splicing to produce the sweet thaumatin proteins from bacterial cultures, thus by-passing the need to cultivate, harvest, transport and process any Katemfe berries. Although this technology exists, for reasons unknown it has not been commercially utilized yet.115\nChoosing a brand name of Talin for the new product, Tate & Lyle established a subsidiary called The Talin Company to handle its production and marketing. The Talin Company changed hands several times and underwent a corporate merger before being acquired by The Braes Group, a European natural food ingredients company. The production of Talin is now handled by a British subsidiary of The Braes Group, Overseal Foods, Ltd.116\nThaumatin was first permitted as a food additive by the Japanese in 1979 and has since been approved as a sweetener in Australia and several European countries. It has been given GRAS status in the U.S., but is only allowed as a flavor enhancer in flavoring agents, animal feeds, oral care products and beverages. It is also used in other countries in sweetener blends, chewing gums, vitamin tablets, baked goods, dairy products and pharmaceuticals.117 While Talin is not commercially available to the average consumer in this country, it is possible to order the dried, unprocessed fruit of the Katemfe plant online at www.bouncingb.com/thaumatococcus_danielli.php . (It is not cheap, though--1 ounce of the dried fruit goes for $30.)\nStevia\nStevia, another natural sweetener derived from a plant, is becoming a well-known option in many U.S. health food stores. A native of Paraguay and a member of the sunflower family, the stevia plant is botanically known as Stevia rebaudiana. The plant is also referred to as Bertoni, a nod of remembrance toward Moises S. Bertoni, the Italian botanist who first studied stevia in 1899.118 Taken as a whole, the leaves of the stevia plant average at about 30 times sweeter than sucrose.119 Scientists have isolated and named a number of individual sweet compounds within the stevia plant, chiefly including stevioside, steviobioside, rebaudiosides A, B, C, D and E, and dulcoside A. The sweetness of these purified substances varies between 50 to 450 times that of sucrose. (Stevioside, the most commonly-used extractive of stevia, is about 300 times sweeter than sucrose.)120\nStevia leaves and stevioside are virtually calorie-free, beneficial in the prevention of cavities and do not trigger a rise in blood sugar. They are not only safe for diabetics and hypoglycemics, but in some countries stevia leaves are even prescribed as a medicinal substance for these conditions because they normalize pancreatic function and thus aid in the metabolism of sugar.121 The whole stevia leaves contain a number of beneficial compounds, including ascorbic acid, calcium, beta-carotene, chromium, cobalt, iron, magnesium, manganese, niacin, phosphorus, potassium, riboflavin, selenium, silicon, sodium, thiamin, tin and zinc.122 (It should be noted that only the whole stevia leaves have nutritive benefits. Stevioside extracts merely function as a sweetener and pass through the body undigested, although they do possess anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties.)123 When applied topically, the stevia leaves also fight acne and speed wound healing while also reducing the formation of scar tissue.124\nWhile natives of Paraguay have used the stevia plant for many centuries, the western world has also had a few centuries of experience with this sweet plant, dating back much earlier than Bertoni\u2019s time. Spanish Conquistadors of the sixteenth century learned about stevia from the local Guarani and Mato Grosso societies, who used it to sweeten teas and herbal medicines. Early European settlers sweetened foods, teas and other beverages with stevia, and Gauchos (the local version of what we might call cowboys) in the region of Paraguay later used it as a sweetener.\nIn the early 1970s, the Japanese government and regulatory agencies began to take a distinct stand against artificial sweeteners, especially aspartame, due to their possible health risks. After conducting extensive tests on stevia and stevioside, they accepted it as a safe alternative and gave it government sanction for widespread usage. By 1977 the Maruzen Kasei Co., Ltd. started extracting stevioside on a commercial basis in Japan. For over 25 years now, the Japanese have used stevia and its extracts as a table top sweetener, in soft drinks, baked goods, pickles, fruit juices, jams and jellies, candies, yogurts, pastries, chewing gum, sherbets, toothpaste and tobacco products. It has reportedly captured over 50% of the Japanese sweetening market,125 even though the Japanese technically classify it as a food additive. In all this time, there have never been any reports of toxicity or adverse reactions to its usage. Stevia is also used as a sweet food additive in South Korea, Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, and as a dietary supplement in China, western Europe and the U.S.126\nStevia did not have a very easy entry into the U.S. market. The earliest introduction into this country was probably in the late 1970s or early \u201880s. Although the FDA had not ruled on stevia one way or another at that time, a provision in federal law allows for the food industry to make a self-determination of Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status for items with a long history of \"common use in food\" prior to 1958, providing that it enjoyed widespread use without any apparent adverse health effects.\nThere was relatively little popular awareness of stevia at that time, but a handful of food producers were including it in their products under that most nebulous of categories--\"natural flavors.\" Among those marketing or developing products containing stevia were the Lipton Tea Company, Celestial Seasonings, and Traditional Medicinals, as well as a host of smaller firms. One of these smaller firms was a Utah-based nutritional products company by the name of Sunrider International.\nIn 1985, Kerry Nielson was director of operations at Sunrider. (The reader is advised to recall that this was the same time period during which G D Searle & Company and Monsanto were winning major victories toward FDA approval of aspartame. Whereas the patent on aspartame was extremely lucrative for these companies, it is impossible under U.S. law to hold a patent on a naturally occurring substance.) Nielson and his company were among the first to feel the regulatory backlash directed at stevia and its purveyors.\nSunrider, which had recently began marketing a stevioside sweetening product called Trusweet, was informed of a trademark infringement complaint filed by the NutraSweet Company against their product. Notwithstanding the baseless nature of this complaint, Sunrider knew that they did not have the economic resources to fight a legal battle with NutraSweet. Rather than do so, they changed the product's name to Sunectar and hoped that this would resolve the issue. But this wasn't the end of Sunrider's legal problems with stevia.\nNot long afterward, the U.S. Department of Agriculture paid a visit to the company's headquarters. As Mr. Nielson himself recalls, \"I thought it was strange because they asked specifically to see the stevia [whereas normally] they would just go through and have a look at everything\u2026. When we took them over to the area where we had the stevia, the inspector dug out a bunch of red tags and started slapping them on everything.\" The stevia was all burned and the company was instructed to cease and desist from any further importation. The only explanation given by the inspectors for this action was \"suspicion of adulteration,\" which usually means contamination of some sort. However, the inspectors did not take any samples of the stevia with them in order to test for contamination. Sunrider continued to meet with FDA stonewalling on the matter and eventually gave up on the idea of using stevia as a sweetener, opting instead to formulate a less-controversial skin-care product containing stevia. Once this change of course was established, the FDA dropped its embargo and relinquished all concerns over its \"suspicion of adulteration.\"127\nIt was around that same time that the Arizona-based Wisdom Natural Brands company began having problems with stevia products as well. Jim May, founder and president of the company, had even gone so far as to submit test samples of stevia to the FDA to assure that it would be okay to use it in the company\u2019s products. Initially, May received confirmation that there would be no problems with importing the whole leaves of the plant or a liquid concentrate of stevioside. However, the FDA later reversed course and ordered the company to stop importing all stevia products. May recounts that he was told in a phone conversation with the FDA that (once again) the NutraSweet Company had been behind the complaint. (The FDA and NutraSweet both deny that NutraSweet ever had any involvement in the FDA\u2019s actions.) May, who had only been selling between $100 and $200 worth of stevia per month, says that he was also told by one FDA agent that \"if [the FDA] wanted to make carrots [be] against the law, we could do it.\"128\nOne of the next major targets would be the Colorado-based tea company Celestial Seasonings. In the mid 1980s, representatives of an \"anonymous firm\" lodged a trade complaint with the FDA, charging that the Celestial Seasonings company was using stevia extracts in four products which were therefore \"adulterated.\" The company responded by formally petitioning for stevia\u2019s GRAS status and presenting the FDA with substantial evidence that stevia had a long history of safe usage. The FDA declined to even process the company\u2019s petition and continued to pressure them to stop using stevia, as well as to turn over the names of other companies which were using the controversial sweetener. Under continuing harassment, Celestial Seasonings relented on both counts.129\nIt would preserve some small measure of the FDA\u2019s dignity if these had only been isolated incidents, or even if they were the worst incidents of their kind\u2026but it gets worse. In 1991 the FDA began to escalate the whole matter to the level of a War on Drugs, issuing \"Import Alert Number 45-06,\" which declared stevia an \"unsafe food additive\" and prohibited its import into the U.S. (It is interesting to note that the text of this document mentions that stevia \"has been used throughout history\" without any mention of negative side effects.)130 It was in that same year when a gang of armed federal marshals raided the Arlington, Texas warehouse of businessman Oscar Rodes, served him with a warrant, and proceeded to seize and burn his most recent shipment of stevia and stevioside powder for use in natural teas.131 The FDA has even gone so far as to raid health food stores suspected of selling stevia products and to order the confiscation of books which refer to stevia\u2019s potential use as a natural sweetener.132\nAt this point, a number of companies and individuals began to seriously address the task of seeking FDA approval through formal, procedural channels. Lynda Sadler, president of the California-based Traditional Medicinals herbal-tea company, along with the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA) and an attorney by the name of William R. Pendergast, started to work on persuading the FDA that the marketing of stevia should be permitted based on its having been used safely and widely in food prior to 1958.\nPendergast and the others submitted more than 900 articles to the FDA, documenting that the herb has been used safely for \"hundreds of years\" by \"millions of people.\" The FDA said that they needed more specific and scientific information, so the Herbal Research Foundation did extensive scientific research to address specific FDA concerns. The FDA stonewalled this information and dragged their feet until Sadler, the AHPA and Pendergast were finally forced to drop the matter, which was draining much time and money.\nThe Lipton Tea Company then picked up the cause in 1994, submitting a 2-inch thick petition for GRAS status. Despite Lipton\u2019s credentials within the food industry, they met with similar bureaucratic resistance. In this case and the previous attempts by Pendergast et al., the FDA ignored their usual protocol and refused to even file the petitions for approval. Once a petition is filed, the information submitted becomes available for public review during the same time period in which the FDA is reviewing it. This would have left the FDA in the position of having to publicly defend its actions, something which they were unwilling to do. In one meeting with FDA officials, an AHPA representative asked what amount of information would be required for submission before the FDA would formally file a petition. The FDA's Direct Additives Branch chief, Eugene Coleman, replied: \"This may sound flippant, but we [will] know that number when we see it.\"133\nOn the rare occasions when someone managed to get a straight answer from an FDA official as to their bizarre stance towards stevia, the usual reasons have been suspicions of toxicity and/or a possible adverse effect on fertility. (Some sources also say that the FDA refuses to label any natural substance as a sweetener unless it is a carbohydrate.)134 These allegations are based upon two studies--a 1968 rat study and a 1988 mouse study published in a Brazilian pharmacological journal.\nThe first of these two was conducted in Uruguay by a Purdue University biochemist named Joseph Kuc. While the FDA interprets this study as casting reasonable doubt upon the safety of stevia, Kuc himself has gone on record as saying that his results are not supportive of these claims. While the rats in the study did suffer from the effects of toxicity and from a reduction in the numbers of offspring, Kuc points out that they were fed the entire stevia plant, not just the sweet leaves. The Brazilian study involved an overly-small group of mice and suffered from a number of methodological and design flaws. The study documented only very scant information about the quantities of stevia which the mice consumed and how it was prepared. The FDA has also alluded to several South American studies which have supposedly questioned the safety of stevia, although they admit that they have never even been able to acquire copies of these studies. (It should be noted that the extensive scientific studies conducted on stevia by the Japanese have not indicated any toxicity or reproductive hazards.)135\nIn September of 1995, after much thankless effort on the part of many parties, the FDA finally relented by revising their 1991 Import Alert with the issuance of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. Under that law, stevia was cleared for import into the U.S., providing that it only be labeled and used as a dietary supplement and not as a sweetener.136 This allows U.S. companies to use and sell stevia, but only by walking the narrow line of not implicating it in any way as a sweetener.\nThe official status of stevia has not changed as of the time of this article\u2019s publication, but the future of this contentious little plant is being shaped in very exciting ways. Despite the best efforts of the establishment to hold it back, there exists something of an informal \"underground\" of those who seek to vindicate stevia and openly market it as a sweetener. The Price Foundation itself is playing a role in this cause, but one of the most well-known advocates is Donna Gates, author of The Body Ecology Diet. Gates openly champions the cause of stevia as a sweetener and has stated that she will go to jail, if necessary, to win the FDA\u2019s approval. There are also some exciting possibilities brewing in Canada, where stevia may be sold as a tea but not a sweetener. A Vancouver company by the name of Royal-Sweet International is developing a stevia sweetener which they plan to export into the booming Asian market, a move which just may attract the attention of other corporate interests. Also, there has been talk of growing Canadian stevia as a cash crop, possibly even replacing Canadian tobacco.137\nTo summarize, while we will all have to wait to see what the future holds for stevia, we should not wait to begin using it and reaping its benefits. There are currently a number of outlets through which one may acquire stevia (see www.holisticmed.com/sweet/sweet.txt ), and they vary quite a bit in taste and quality. This author\u2019s personal favorite stevia products are available from Wisdom Natural Brands, found at www.wisdomherbs.com . For more information on stevia, the reader is advised to read the book The Stevia Story: A Tale of Incredible Sweetness & Intrigue, by Bill and Linda Bonvie and Donna Gates.\nLicorice root\nLicorice root is a substance of which virtually everyone is aware, but comparatively few people realize its sweetening properties. (Although many people equate licorice with the sweet red strips of candy called by the same name, those do not actually contain any licorice root. These candy \"licorices\" are typically mixtures of corn syrup, sugar, flour, margarine and artificial flavorings.) The plant of which licorice root is the root is the blue flowering pea plant, botanically known as glycyrrhiza glabra. This plant grows wild in much of southern Europe and in Asia. Licorice root has been used since ancient Egyptian times to treat upset stomachs, chest infections and coughs, and has also been used by various cultures to ward of demons and invoke mystical powers.138\nLicorice root may be used in its unadulterated, ground-up form, or the primary sweetening compound may be extracted. In this case, that compound is known as glycyrrhizin (or also glycyrrhizic acid). Glycyrrhizin is between 50 and 100 times sweeter than sucrose, but it also imparts a definite (and familiar) aftertaste of licorice. Due to its low sweetness (in comparison to many artificial sweeteners) and strong aftertaste, it has not enjoyed much success as a commercial sweetener. The exception to this is its use in herbal tea blends, where the licorice aftertaste may be blended quite well with other tastes.\nThere is a very long historical record of the safety of licorice as a food and a medicinal herb. In fact, it is one of the most commonly-used herbs worldwide. It is safe for diabetics, but its lack of versatility as an all-around sweetening agent limits its potential applications. There has never been a single documented case of adverse reaction to the consumption of licorice root in its whole, ground-up form.139 This is not quite the case with the extracted glycyrrhizin, which is still very safe for most people but may cause hypertension, edema, sodium retention and mild depletion of potassium when consumed excessively or by certain sensitive individuals. (Many herbalists recommend against long-term, excessive consumption of ground licorice root due to concerns that it also may cause hypertension and edema in some people.) For this very reason, Japanese and Dutch regulatory agencies agree that the total daily consumption of glycyrrhizin should not exceed 200 milligrams. Adverse symptoms of excessive glycyrrhizin consumption generally disappear shortly after a person lowers their dietary intake of products containing the sweetener.140\nGlycyrrhizin\nGlycyrrhizin and other compounds derived from it are widely used in Japan for sweetening foods, beverages, medicines, and tobacco. Within the U.S., glycyrrhizin has GRAS status as a flavoring agent, but is not allowed as a sweetener.141 To date, there is only one commercial glycyrrhizin product available--MagnaSweet from MAFCO Worldwide. They advertise that MagnaSweet \"can be used in a wide range of applications to enhance, intensify and potentiate flavors; augment or modify sweetness; eliminate or modify bitterness; and mask unpleasant aftertastes.\"142 MagnaSweet is currently only available to the food processing industry.\nLo Han Kuo\nLo Han Kuo (sometimes spelled Lo Han Guo) is a sweet Chinese fruit in the cucumber, melon, squash, and gourd family which has the potential to be as good of a natural option as stevia. The Lo Han fruit has been used by local people in southern provinces of China for centuries as a sweetener and a medicinal herb for the treatment of lung congestion, colds, sore throats and minor stomach and intestinal problems. Traditional Chinese doctors consider it to be a yin substance, meaning that it releases excess heat from the body. For this reason, it is traditionally consumed and served during the hot summer months in China. There has never been any recorded incidence of adverse reactions to Lo Han fruit or its extractives.143,144,145\nIt was only as recently as the early 20th Century that Lo Han has come to the attention of the Western scientific community, and it has undergone several changes in its official botanical classification. Being a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, it was first classified as Momordica grosvenorii, then Thladiantha grosvenorii, and most recently as Siraitia grosvenorii. Scientific studies on Lo Han did not begin until the 1970s. A number of compounds (dubbed as mogrosides) were isolated from the fruit, of which mogrosides IV and V were determined to be the principle sweet constituents. The two substances are variously rated at being between 230 and 425 times sweeter than sucrose, depending upon their application.146 The whole dried fruit is 300 times sweeter than sucrose.147\nAs is also the case with stevia, the human digestive system is unable to break down the sweet compounds within Lo Han fruit. Consequently, it triggers no rise in blood sugar levels and is completely safe for diabetics and hypoglycemics. It also helps promote the metabolization of stored body fat. Modern scientific research has shown that Lo Han extracts help relieve gastritis, constipation and respiratory inflammations, and they also appear to inhibit the Epstein-Barr virus and display anti-carcinogenic properties.148\nWhile the FDA has not made any conclusive rulings upon the status of Lo Han and its extractives, they are currently available to U.S. consumers and have not been opposed in any way by regulatory authorities. A case may certainly be made that Lo Han should be allowed as a GRAS substance due to its substantial history of safe usage prior to 1958. A handful of companies are marketing Lo Han sweetening products in the U.S. and elsewhere. Of these, the author\u2019s two product recommendations are Slim & Sweet from Wisdom Natural Brands ( www.wisdomherbs.com ) and SweetLIFE from Chi Fai\u2019s Inc. ( www.chifaisgourmet.com/CFSweetLIFE2.htm ). Dried Lo Han fruit is frequently available in Chinese and Oriental markets, or may be ordered online at www.chinanaturalproduct.com/whole_dried_Lo_Han_Kuo_fruit.htm .\nGlycerine\nGlycerine (also spelled as glycerin or called glycerol) takes the prize as the most versatile and vexatious substance in our discussion. While technically classified by the FDA as a carbohydrate, this placement was made by default only. Glycerine does not qualify as a fat since it does not contain fatty acids, and it does not qualify as a protein because it has no amino acids, so the only remaining macronutrient category is the carbohydrates. Glycerine (which is technically known as a trihydric alcohol) definitely deserves to be included in the macronutrient arena, even though it defies clear categorization.149\nGlycerine is a colorless, odorless, viscous liquid with a very sweet and slightly astringent taste. Molecules of glycerine form the structural backbone of nearly all vegetable oils and animal fats. It was first identified in a laboratory in Sweden in 1779 by Karl Wilhelm Scheele. Scheele named the substance after the Greek word \"glykys,\" which means \"sweet.\"150 Glycerine is not chemically related to sugar and seems to have a very negligible effect on insulin and blood sugar levels, thus making it a safe sweetener for diabetics, hypoglycemics and people with Candida yeast problems.\nWhile it is not generally recommended that glycerine be consumed undiluted, there are a number of health benefits to consuming it as a component of foods or beverages. Fitness-conscious people may appreciate glycerine because it increases blood volume (thus helping delay dehydration when exercising), enhances temperature regulation and is claimed to improve physical performance in the heat. (It should be noted that certain individuals should avoid consuming excessive amounts of glycerine due to the very fact that it does increase blood volume. This would include pregnant women and people who suffer from high blood pressure, diabetes or kidney diseases.)151 Glycerine is also a source of lecithin and tocopherols (vitamin E).152\nFood-grade glycerine is produced from animal sources (usually tallow), vegetable sources (various vegetable oils) and from propylene alcohol. While the molecular structure of glycerine from any of these sources is exactly the same, there are obvious concerns as to the source of the glycerine which one may be consuming. (Unfortunately, this information is very seldom available when glycerine shows up as an ingredient in a product.) Some sources say that glycerine from propylene alcohol is irritating to the skin and scalp when used in topical products.153 Non-food-grade glycerine is a major by-product in the production of biodiesel fuels. The food industry\u2019s primary interest in glycerine is as a moisturizing/softening/texture agent, but it is also used in skin moisturizers, lotions, deodorants, soaps, makeup, toothpaste, pharmaceuticals, paper manufacturing, inks for printing, textiles, plastics, electronic components, paint brush cleaners, topical medications for male erectile dysfunction and in the manufacture of nitroglycerine (the main component of dynamite).154 There are over 1500 end-use applications for glycerine.155\nThe issue of how glycerine is digested and used by the body is complex. The simple answer is that glycerine is utilized by the body in different ways (or not at all) depending upon the state one is in when one consumes it. Even if one does not consume any glycerine as an ingredient of any food items, it is normally liberated from various naturally occurring food sources during the digestive process. It is also released into the body when a person metabolizes body-fat reserves.\nNo matter how the glycerine molecules find their way into the digestive system, their fate seems to depend upon the energy status of the person at that moment. If a person has a neutral or positive state of general metabolic energy, glycerine may be (at least partially) excreted unchanged, metabolized into phoshoglycerides for use within cell membranes, or used in the conversion of extra dietary calories into body fat. If a person is in a negative state of metabolic energy, the glycerine may be metabolized into energy through two different processes, gluconeogenesis (the production of blood glucose) or glycolysis (a different energy-creation pathway in the body).156\nIn the final analysis glycerine is a sweetening option worth experimenting with, unless one is pregnant or has high blood pressure, diabetes or kidney disease. Those who suffer from Candida or other yeast problems may find it especially beneficial. Try to seek out glycerine available from a product line which is trustworthy--Frontier Natural Products is one reliable source, available on the internet at www.frontiercoop.com/shop/merchant.mvc (search under the \"glycerin\" spelling). An excellent resource for recipes using glycerine as a sweetener is The Complete Candida Cookbook, by Gail Burton.\nFructooligosaccharides\nFructooligosaccharides (usually abbreviated to FOS) and inulin are terms referring to naturally-occurring, mildly-sweet, indigestible carbohydrates. (FOS is something of an umbrella term for a class of oligosaccharides; inulin is a specific type of FOS. Hereafter, any mention of FOS is meant to include inulin as well, unless otherwise specified.) While the FDA classifies FOS as being only a food ingredient which is usually used as a fat-replacer in low-fat foods, it does have some potential as a sweetening substance. It does not affect blood sugar levels, and so is suitable for diabetics and hypoglycemics.157\nFOS is commonly extracted from chicory roots and Jerusalem artichokes (as it occurs in relatively large quantities in these items), but it is also found in onions, leeks, garlic, common artichokes, bananas, rye, barley, dandelion leaves, burdock roots and honey. Some presence of FOS has been noted in over 36,000 plants worldwide, so this is a very partial list.158\nFOS is structurally built out of chains of fructose molecules, with the chains ranging from 2 to 60 units long. The number of fructose molecules which are bound together is called the \"degree of polymerization,\" or DP, and it varies according to the plant source, type of climate, time of harvest, and the duration and conditions of post-harvest storage. Naturally occurring sources of FOS generally contain mixtures of various degrees of polymerization, but standardized extracts of FOS generally average at a DP of about 4. Inulin may be standardized to an average DP of 22, which is considered to be long-chain inulin.159\nThese chains of fructose cannot be broken down by the human digestive system, but they can be broken down and consumed by the bacteria in the digestive tract. For this reason, FOS is considered to be a prebiotic--a substance which provides nourishment for the gastrointestinal flora. Prebiotics, like probiotics (such as live-culture yogurt--substances which actually contain the same bacteria which are the beneficial flora in the human digestive tract), help promote regularity, prevent yeast overgrowth and are beneficial for those with Crohn\u2019s disease, colitis or who are on kidney dialysis. Prebiotics and probiotics are additionally beneficial when taken together.160\nThe finer point here which is frequently overlooked is that nonspecific extracts of FOS will provide nourishment for friendly bacteria (lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, etc.) and pathogenic bacteria (E. coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Clostridium, etc.) alike, whereas standardized extracts of long-chain inulin will selectively nourish only the friendly flora. It is likely for this reason that some people experience gastric distress after consuming foods containing nonspecific blends of FOS--if one already has a problem with the balance of the intestinal flora, a nonspecific blend of FOS may exacerbate the problem.161\nAside from feeding the bacteria of the digestive tract, all forms of FOS act as dietary fiber. Thus, consumption of FOS may help to shorten fecal transit time, increase fecal bulk and reduces constipation. It has also been shown to reduce both cholesterol and triglyceride levels and may provide improved absorption of minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and phosphate.162\nDue to the relatively-low sweetness of FOS and inulin, it is easier to use it for sweetening purposes in combination with another sweet substance. While FOS products are commercially available from different sources, the author recommends an inulin product called Chicolin, from BioQuest Imports International, Inc. ( www.greenalive.com/chicolin.html ). Chicolin has recommended specifications for blending with stevia to achieve a desirable level of sweetness.\nAnd finally we come to the hodgepodge category of \"what is left,\" a few other sweet plants and herbs that have been and are still being tested for possible use as commercial sweeteners. Just because they have not been commercially utilized doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that one could not attempt to cultivate them and do some personal experimentation. To that end, here is a short list of additional sweet plants by botanical name: Hydrangea macrophylla Seringe var. thunbergii (and other species in this genus), Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii Diels, Capparis masakai Levl, Pentadiplandra brazzeana Baillon, Curculigo latifolia, Lippia dulcis, Rubus suavissimus, Phlomis betonicoides Diels, Polypodium vulgare, Polypodium glycyrrhiza, and Pterocarya paliurus Batal.163 The reader is strongly advised to thoroughly research these plants before attempting to ingest any part(s) of them. Some technical information about all of the plants in this list may be found in the book, Alternative Sweeteners, Third Edition, Lyn O\u2019Brien Nabors (editor).\nWhile even this has not been a complete list of all of the artificial/alternative sweeteners that are available, we have at least touched upon all of the major options currently in use. While we have clearly found some of the sweeteners in use today to be plagued with numerous dangers, there are also many healthful and promising options available to the informed consumer. It is no accident that most of the good options are provided to us by plants and herbs, while most of the bad options have been created in laboratories. Mother Nature clearly did not intend for us to have to suffer from the Sugar-Free Blues.\nReferences\n"}, {"score": 1672.6921, "uuid": "58b08dca-85c4-547f-9cc0-365a99fe5ba7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0710wb-86-01636", "target_hostname": "www.thatsfit.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thatsfit.com/2009/09/04/artificial-sweeteners-diet-friend-or-foe/", "page_rank": 1.1833098e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>Artificial</em> <em>Sweeteners</em> - Diet Friend or Foe? - That&#x27;s Fit", "snippet": "Love Splenda and use it often leave the <em>white</em> bread alone and <em>sugar</em> it is adective i can have spelenda and not crave seconds. agree on this article. we should take <em>Artificial</em> <em>Sweeteners</em> as a sugar&#x27;s substitute.

True, swapping a can of Coke Zero for the regular kind slices 139 calories from your daily intake, but research from the University of Liverpool in England suggests that your body processes artificial, calorie-free sweeteners the same way it does regular sugar .\nJust as your taste buds can't differentiate between regular and artificial sweeteners (aside that chemically aftertaste), the receptors in your intestines aren't able to tell the difference either. Once the intestines sense sweetness, they seek out glucose to absorb. So even though that Equal is calorie-free -- your body may still take calories from somewhere else if these receptors are activated.\n\" Artificial sweeteners can also activate the glucose sensor and increase the capacity of the intestine to absorb more sugar,\" Soraya Shirazi-Beechey, lead author of the study and a professor of Molecular Physiology and Biochemistry at Liverpool University, tells the Daily Mail. \"If someone wants to lose weight, I don't think artificial sweeteners are going to help,\" she says. \"My recommendation is to eat natural foods, but to eat less of them.\"\nIt's unclear from Shirazi-Beechey's research whether the amount of glucose absorbed after sensing an artificial sweetener would equal the calorie-equivalent of a regular soda.\nAlthough this research is preliminary, it is part of a growing body of evidence that sweeteners are not a fool-proof alternative to regular sugar. Other studies have found that sweeteners don't satisfy the cravings in the brain the way real sugar does, meaning that after that diet soda you may still be craving something sweet.\nBut for soda addicts in particular, the switch to diet may cut significant calories and be a good stepping stone to healthier beverages, such as water and occasional fruit juices.\nIn fact, the jury is still out on artificial sweeteners, as a recent study found they may help prevent weight gain . So while science continues to debate, cut back on sugar and sweeteners all together -- everything in moderation is the real key to weight loss.\n"}, {"score": 1646.6176, "uuid": "0d7caa3c-e31d-589b-82a8-1712628e915d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1303wb-58-04593", "target_hostname": "www.manyyearsyoung.com", "target_uri": "http://www.manyyearsyoung.com/2011/06/artificial-sweetener-illusion.html", "page_rank": 1.2416687e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Many Years Young: The <em>Artificial</em> <em>Sweetener</em> Illusion", "snippet": "&quot;Data from this and other prospective studies suggest that the promotion of diet sodas and <em>artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em> as healthy alternatives may be ill-advised,&quot; said Helen P.

So when you find yourself in a situation that demands a sugary treat, you often go for the artificial stuff, expecting it to be healthier for you. But are artificial sweeteners all they\u2019re cracked up to be, or would you be better off with the natural choice?\nRead on to learn what you can expect to get out of natural sugar compared to the manmade alternatives.\nArtificial Packs More Punch\nYou may think you can use as much artificial sweetener as you want, but be careful. As sugar substitutes are much sweeter than sugar, adding the same amount of artificial sweetener as you would natural sugar can ruin the flavor of your drink or favorite dessert.\nReal Is Fatter\nCompared to artificial sweeteners, real sugar has more calories, making it easier to gain weight when consuming real sugar. But that doesn\u2019t mean artificial sugars are fat-free. In fact, many people who primarily consume artificial sweeteners wind up gaining more weight than their real-sugar-eating counterparts. Why? Because they think since artificial sweetener has fewer calories, they can eat more. This leads to the consumption of more cookies, cakes, and other foods filled with useless calories.\nDid you know that many people eat nearly 20 teaspoons of sugar a day?\nThey\u2019re Not Carcinogenic\nWhen sugar alternatives first hit the market, there was a big scare that artificial sweeteners were linked to cancer. However, after a number of careful studies, researchers disproved this idea, as they found no definitive link between cancer risk and use of artificial sweeteners.\nAll Are Considered Safe\nIn order to be on your grocer\u2019s shelf, natural and artificial sweeteners must meet approval by the appropriate regulating body. In America, this is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the FDA has approved five artificial sweeteners: saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, D-tagatose, and acesulfame potassium. Another sweetener making big waves is stevia. Though it cannot be sold as an artificial sweetener in America, it is sold as a dietary supplement after more than 20 years of safe use in Japan.\nFake May Improve Your Health\nWhile the jury is still out, early testing has found that use of aspartame may actually give your health the upper hand. In a study at Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, researchers found aspartame to be useful in providing pain relief to individuals suffering from sickle cell anemia, osteoarthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Only time will tell if these initial findings will hold up and artificial sweeteners will one day be used as a medical therapy.\nYou May Have Symptoms\nThough artificial sweeteners haven\u2019t been found to bring about cancer or other dangerous and deadly diseases, they can have mild side effects on certain people. Some of the most common include an upset stomach and headaches. In the event you find yourself experiencing either of these symptoms, lay off the artificial to find out if that\u2019s the cause of your problems.\nModeration Is Key\nFor most people, eating natural sugar or using artificial sweeteners isn\u2019t going to cause big weight fluctuations or health problems. However, eating too much of any kind of sweetener \u2013 whether it is natural or manmade \u2013 is where trouble comes in. It is especially dangerous to consume excessive sugar if you\u2019re living with diabetes. Stay safe with your sweets by avoiding too much of any good thing.\nHow\u2019s It Get White?\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen sugar right off the cane, you know that sugar isn\u2019t naturally white. Instead, it is yellow or brown. So how do they come up with that pure, white color for the sugar you may use every day? Through a bleaching process. In other words, the white sugar you use in your tea is essentially an artificial sweetener. Want nothing but nature? Better make sure your sugar is brown and yellow.\n"}, {"score": 1640.914, "uuid": "670f067f-98be-59e5-a833-0a28c4d992e2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1507wb-65-09527", "target_hostname": "diabetes.ca", "target_uri": "http://diabetes.ca/diabetes-and-you/nutrition/sweeteners/", "page_rank": 1.7532297e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "<em>Sweeteners</em>", "snippet": "<em>Are</em> <em>sugar</em> substitutes a <em>better</em> way to sweeten foods without the extra calories?

Are sugar substitutes a better way to sweeten foods without the extra calories? Let\u2019s consider the sweet choices available to people with diabetes, and how they fit as part of a healthy diet.\nTwo types of sweeteners\nThere are two basic categories of sweeteners, nutritive and nonnutritive. Nutritive sweeteners provide calories or energy to the diet at about four calories per gram, just like carbohydrate or protein. Common examples of nutritive sweeteners include white and brown table sugars and molasses, honey, and syrups such as maple and corn. These are all sweet tasting because of the presence of glucose and fructose, alone or together as sucrose. Sugar alcohols known as sugar relatives are another category of nutritive sweeteners. They are derived from fruits or produced commercially from dextrose. The most common include: sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol and maltitol. Sugar alcohols also provide energy to the body and may affect your blood glucose. Nonnutritive sweeteners, also called sugar substitutes or artificial sweeteners, do not provide calories and will not influence blood sugars. These include: saccharin, cyclamate, aspartame, sucralose and acesulfame potassium.\nArtifical sweeteners\nSaccharin is the oldest of the nonnutritive sweeteners, and is available under the brand name HermesetasTM . In Canada, saccharine is available only as a tabletop sweetener and is sold in tablet or powder form in pharmacies. It is 300 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar) but has a slightly bitter/metallic aftertaste. Because saccharine is not metabolized in the human body, it does not contribute energy or calories. Saccharin has been the center of controversy for many years because of its alleged relationship with cancer; however, research studies have been unable to find direct associations.\nAspartame is marketed for commercial use under the brand name NutraSweetTM and is found in breakfast cereals, soft drinks, desserts and candy. It is also known as EqualTM, a powder for use in the home. Although technically considered a nutritive sweetener contributing four calories per gram, aspartame is 200 times sweeter than sugar and very little is needed to achieve sweetness. Therefore, its calorie contribution is negligible. Aspartame is made up of two amino acids, the building blocks of protein: aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is therefore digested and metabolized the same way as any other protein foods. People diagnosed with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare hereditary disease, need to limit phenylalanine intake and therefore should not sure aspartame.\nCyclamate is marketed under the brand name SucarylTM and is used in Sugar TwinTM and Weight WatchersTM. It is 30 times sweeter than table sugar and has no aftertaste. This sweetener is heat stable, so it can be used in hot and cold foods. Cyclamate is heat stable, so you can cook and bake with it without losing its sweet taste. In Canada, cyclamate can only be purchased as a tabletop sweetener or as a sweetening additive in medication.\nSucralose, available as a tabletop sweetener and as an ingredient in food processing, is marketed as SplendaTM. Sucralose is a white crystalline powder made from sugar itself. Sucralose is 400 to 800 times sweeter than table sugar. Because it is stable even when subjected to extreme heat or cold, sucralose can be used in a variety of cold and hot drinks, pastries and baked goods, and frozen and canned fruits and vegetables. Although its chemical structure is very close to that of sucrose or table sugar, sucralose is not recognized by the body as a carbohydrate and has no effect on insulin secretion or overall carbohydrate metabolism in healthy human beings.\nAcesuflame Potassium (AceK) is the latest nonnutritive sweetener approved by Health Canada. It is marketed under the brand name SunettTM. AceK is found in beverages, fruit spreads, baked goods, dessert bases, tabletop sweeteners, hard candies, chewing gum and breath fresheners. It is 200 times sweeter than table sugar. People who are on a potassium restricted diet or have sulfa-antibiotic based allergies should discuss the use of Ace-K with their physician.\nAll sweeteners available in Canada go through rigorous testing. Once they have been approved it means that they are suitable for use by all Canadians, including those with diabetes.\nAlthough non-nutritive sweeteners taste sweet and do not add calories to food, they often cannot be substituted directly for sugar in recipes. Sugars and syrups also add to the texture and colour of foods in ways that these sweeteners will not. Many of the manufacturers have developed special recipes for using these products.\nSugar Alcohols\nBecause sugar alcohols are absorbed and metabolized by the body more slowly, they were once believed to be good sugar substitutes for people with diabetes. However, sugar alcohols sometimes cause abdominal discomfort and, because they provide calories, they are not as popular a choice as artifical sweeteners. The real benefit of sugar alcohols is related to the inability of mouth bacteria to use them as a source of energy. Therefore, they do not contribute to dental caries (cavities). Some products that may contain sugar alcohols include hard candy, chocolate, table syrups, chewing gum, jams and jellies and some cough lozenges and syrups.\nAre these sweeteners safe?\nHealth Canada considers all available scientific information on the effectiveness and safety of sweeteners. Regulations are then developed to identify how they should be used and what amounts should be allowed. A recommended daily intake (RDI) has been set by the Canadian government for most sweeteners. Since RDIs are based on body weight and may therefore be different for everyone, ask your dietitian about your own RDI if you use sweeteners regularly. Current evidence suggests that \u2018normal use\u2019 concentrations of artificial sweeteners are not a health risk.\nThe real thing\nIn the past, people with diabetes were told to avoid sugars and other carbohydrates. Current research shows that it is the amount of carbohydrate eaten and the rate of its digestion that are the most important factors in blood glucose control. Sugars can be included in a healthy diet as a part of a carefully planned meal plan. Carbohydrates, including sugars, should be spread evenly over the day, as part of slowly digested meals. If you have questions about sugars and your diet, check with your registered dietitian, a certified diabetes educator or the Canadian Diabetes Association.\nOf course, sugars do provide some calories, but foods or drinks made with artificial sweeteners may not always be low in calories either. If you are concerned about calories, it is important to check the nutrition information panel on the food label. Remember, fat provides nine calories per gram, more than twice the amount provided by carbohydrate (including all sugars) and protein.\nUse moderation\nWhen used in moderation as part of a healthy and wellbalanced diet, sugar substitutes can contribute to the enjoyment of eating. They are not, however, a miracle solution in achieving or maintaining a healthy weight nor in managing diabetes. When trying to lose weight, your best bet is to follow the Canada\u2019s Food Guide, and to be a little more active each day. Making sure that you are getting all the nutrients you need to maintain good health should be your first priority.\nClaire Cronier MSc, RD is a nutrition consultant from Kingston, Ontario.

These are all sweet tasting because of the presence of glucose and fructose, alone or together as sucrose. Sugar alcohols known as sugar relatives are another category of nutritive sweeteners. They are derived from fruits or produced commercially from dextrose. The most common include: sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol and maltitol. Sugar alcohols also provide energy to the body and may affect your blood glucose. Nonnutritive sweeteners, also called sugar substitutes or artificial sweeteners, do not provide calories and will not influence blood sugars. These include: saccharin, cyclamate, aspartame, sucralose and acesulfame potassium.\nArtifical sweeteners\nSaccharin is the oldest of the nonnutritive sweeteners, and is available under the brand name HermesetasTM . In Canada, saccharine is available only as a tabletop sweetener and is sold in tablet or powder form in pharmacies. It is 300 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar) but has a slightly bitter/metallic aftertaste. Because saccharine is not metabolized in the human body, it does not contribute energy or calories. Saccharin has been the center of controversy for many years because of its alleged relationship with cancer; however, research studies have been unable to find direct associations.\nAspartame is marketed for commercial use under the brand name NutraSweetTM and is found in breakfast cereals, soft drinks, desserts and candy. It is also known as EqualTM, a powder for use in the home. Although technically considered a nutritive sweetener contributing four calories per gram, aspartame is 200 times sweeter than sugar and very little is needed to achieve sweetness. Therefore, its calorie contribution is negligible. Aspartame is made up of two amino acids, the building blocks of protein: aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is therefore digested and metabolized the same way as any other protein foods. People diagnosed with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare hereditary disease, need to limit phenylalanine intake and therefore should not sure aspartame.\nCyclamate is marketed under the brand name SucarylTM and is used in Sugar TwinTM and Weight WatchersTM. It is 30 times sweeter than table sugar and has no aftertaste. This sweetener is heat stable, so it can be used in hot and cold foods. Cyclamate is heat stable, so you can cook and bake with it without losing its sweet taste. In Canada, cyclamate can only be purchased as a tabletop sweetener or as a sweetening additive in medication.\nSucralose, available as a tabletop sweetener and as an ingredient in food processing, is marketed as SplendaTM. Sucralose is a white crystalline powder made from sugar itself. Sucralose is 400 to 800 times sweeter than table sugar. Because it is stable even when subjected to extreme heat or cold, sucralose can be used in a variety of cold and hot drinks, pastries and baked goods, and frozen and canned fruits and vegetables. Although its chemical structure is very close to that of sucrose or table sugar, sucralose is not recognized by the body as a carbohydrate and has no effect on insulin secretion or overall carbohydrate metabolism in healthy human beings.\nAcesuflame Potassium (AceK) is the latest nonnutritive sweetener approved by Health Canada. It is marketed under the brand name SunettTM. AceK is found in beverages, fruit spreads, baked goods, dessert bases, tabletop sweeteners, hard candies, chewing gum and breath fresheners. It is 200 times sweeter than table sugar. People who are on a potassium restricted diet or have sulfa-antibiotic based allergies should discuss the use of Ace-K with their physician.\nAll sweeteners available in Canada go through rigorous testing. Once they have been approved it means that they are suitable for use by all Canadians, including those with diabetes.\nAlthough non-nutritive sweeteners taste sweet and do not add calories to food, they often cannot be substituted directly for sugar in recipes. Sugars and syrups also add to the texture and colour of foods in ways that these sweeteners will not. Many of the manufacturers have developed special recipes for using these products.\nSugar Alcohols\nBecause sugar alcohols are absorbed and metabolized by the body more slowly, they were once believed to be good sugar substitutes for people with diabetes. However, sugar alcohols sometimes cause abdominal discomfort and, because they provide calories, they are not as popular a choice as artifical sweeteners. The real benefit of sugar alcohols is related to the inability of mouth bacteria to use them as a source of energy. Therefore, they do not contribute to dental caries (cavities). Some products that may contain sugar alcohols include hard candy, chocolate, table syrups, chewing gum, jams and jellies and some cough lozenges and syrups.\nAre these sweeteners safe?\nHealth Canada considers all available scientific information on the effectiveness and safety of sweeteners. Regulations are then developed to identify how they should be used and what amounts should be allowed. A recommended daily intake (RDI) has been set by the Canadian government for most sweeteners. Since RDIs are based on body weight and may therefore be different for everyone, ask your dietitian about your own RDI if you use sweeteners regularly. Current evidence suggests that \u2018normal use\u2019 concentrations of artificial sweeteners are not a health risk.\nThe real thing\nIn the past, people with diabetes were told to avoid sugars and other carbohydrates. Current research shows that it is the amount of carbohydrate eaten and the rate of its digestion that are the most important factors in blood glucose control. Sugars can be included in a healthy diet as a part of a carefully planned meal plan. Carbohydrates, including sugars, should be spread evenly over the day, as part of slowly digested meals. If you have questions about sugars and your diet, check with your registered dietitian, a certified diabetes educator or the Canadian Diabetes Association.\nOf course, sugars do provide some calories, but foods or drinks made with artificial sweeteners may not always be low in calories either. If you are concerned about calories, it is important to check the nutrition information panel on the food label. Remember, fat provides nine calories per gram, more than twice the amount provided by carbohydrate (including all sugars) and protein.\nUse moderation\nWhen used in moderation as part of a healthy and wellbalanced diet, sugar substitutes can contribute to the enjoyment of eating. They are not, however, a miracle solution in achieving or maintaining a healthy weight nor in managing diabetes. When trying to lose weight, your best bet is to follow the Canada\u2019s Food Guide, and to be a little more active each day. Making sure that you are getting all the nutrients you need to maintain good health should be your first priority.\nClaire Cronier MSc, RD is a nutrition consultant from Kingston, Ontario.

Yes No\nNutrition Facts\nMaltitol is made by the hydrogenation of maltose which is obtained from starch. Like other polyols, it does not brown or caramelize as do sugars. Maltitol\u0092s high sweetness allows it to be used without other sweeteners. It exhibits a negligible cooling effect in the mouth compared to most other polyols. Although maltitol is often used to replace sugars in the manufacture of sugar-free foods, it may also be used to replace fat as it gives a creamy texture to food.\nMaltitol is slowly absorbed. Therefore, when maltitol is used, the rise in blood glucose and the insulin response associated with the ingestion of glucose is significantly reduced. The reduced caloric value of maltitol (2.1 calories per gram versus 4.0 for sugar) is consistent with the objective of weight control. Products sweetened with maltitol in place of sugar may be useful in providing a wider variety of reduced-calorie and sugar-free choices to people with diabetes. Recognizing that diabetes is complex and requirements for its management may vary between individuals, the usefulness of maltitol should be discussed between individuals and their health care providers. Foods sweetened with maltitol may contain other ingredients which also contribute calories and other nutrients. These must be considered in meal planning.\nReduced Calorie Alternative to Sugar - Absorption of maltitol by the human body is slow, allowing part of the ingested maltitol to reach the large intestine where metabolism yields fewer calories. Therefore, unlike sugar which contributes four calories per gram, the caloric contribution of maltitol is only 2.1 calories per gram. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has stated it does not object to the use of this value for maltitol in nutrition labeling of foods. For a product to qualify as \"reduced calorie\" in the United States, it must have at least a 25 percent reduction in calories. Maltitol is, therefore, useful in formulating \"reduced calorie\" products.\nThe lower caloric value of maltitol and other polyols is recognized in other countries as well. For example, the European Union has provided a Nutritional Labeling Directive stating that all polyols, including maltitol, are assigned a caloric value of 2.4 calories per gram.\nHot Products\nShop quickly using your personal Order History !

Folks, this is a fraud of gigantic proportions. Since aspartame came on the market in l981, it has accounted for more than 75 percent of the complaints reported in the FDA's Adverse Reaction Monitoring system. the most common adverse reactions attributed to\naspartame are headaches, dizziness, attention difficulties, memory loss, slurred speech and vision problems. this cluster of symptoms has become so common that it is actually referred to as \"aspartame disease\".\nEven more serious disorders have a suspected link with aspartame. Is it an accident that the incidence of brain tumors has increased by 10% since l975? John W. Olney, MD, of the Washington University Medical School in St. Louis believes there may be a link between the two. In an article published in The Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology, he notes that animal studies reveal high levels of brain tumors in aspartame-fed rats. According to Dr. Olney, recent findings show that aspartame has mutagenic (cancer-causing) potential, and the sharp rise in malignant brain tumors coincides with the increased use of aspartame.\nThe U.S. Navy and Air Force published articles in Navy Physiology and Flying Safety with this warning: \"several researchers have found aspartame can increase the frequency of seizures, or lower the stimulation necessary to induce them. this means a pilot who drinks diet sodas is more susceptible to flicker vertigo, or to flicker-induced epileptic activity. It also means that all pilots are potential victims of sudden memory loss, dizziness during instrument flight, and gradual loss of vision.\" more ...\nA 2005 study by the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio showed that increased weight gain and obesity was associated\nwith increased use of diet soda in a population based study. Animal studies have indicated that artificial sweeteners can cause body weight gain. A sweet taste induces an insulin response, which causes blood sugar to be stored in tissues (including fat), but because blood sugar does not increase with artificial sugars, there is hypoglycemia and increased food intake the next time there is a meal. After a while, rats given sweeteners have steadily increased calorie intake, increased body weight, and increased adiposity (fatness). List of sugar substitutes\nDr. Janet Starr Hull\u00a0 -The testing of sucralose reveals that it can cause up to 40 percent shrinkage of the thymus: a gland that is the very foundation of our immune system. Sucralose also causes swelling of the liver and kidneys, and CALCIFICATION of the kidney. Note: if you experience kidney pain, cramping, or an irritated bladder after using sucralose in Splenda, stop use immediately.\nH. J. Roberts, M.D. \"I have observed severe intellectual deterioration associated with the use of aspartame products. It was usually manifest as great difficulty in reading and writing, obvious problems with memory and grossly impaired orientation to time, place and person. Many reactions to aspartame were very serious including seizures and death. Other reactions reported included: Headaches/Migraines, Dizziness, Joint Pain, Nausea, Numbness, Muscle spasms, Weight gain, Rashes, Depression, Fatigue, Irritability, Tachycardia, Insomnia, Vision Loss, Hearing Loss, Heart palpitations, Breathing difficulties, Anxiety attacks, Slurred Speech, Loss of taste, Tinnitus, and Vertigo Memory loss\" more\nJames Bowen, M.D., author of Billions Of People Are Now Aspartame Victims, told the FDA years ago \"Every known metabolite of aspartame is of marked or questionable toxicity and patently unsafe for human use.\" In Aspartame Murders Infants he said: \"At every point in the fertility process aspartame (NutraSweet/Equal/Spoonful/Canderal/Benevia, etc.) destroys. ....It ruins female sexual response and induces male sexual dysfunction. Beyond this, aspartame disrupts fetal development by aborting it or inducing defects. And if a live child is born aspartame may have heinously damaged the DNA of the baby cursing future generation.\" See his paper on Sperm Warfare . We are now taking case histories for class action on aspartame starting with seizures, brain tumors, eye deterioration and blindness, etc.\nJames Bowen, M.D. - \"Lying and deceit on the artificial sweetener issue has been the FDA's Modus Operandi ever since Donald Rummsfeld broke everything decent in the US government to put Aspartame on the market as a \"contract on humanity\". It has no commercial purpose other than a contract on humanity. Either they have done but little testing of sucralose, or they are so afraid of what the public would think of sucralose, and the government if the public but knew what was going on, that they will not tell us! BECAUSE: we have been told nothing about the extensive studies which would have to have been done if very reasonable, and scientifically sound FDA rules had been followed.\"\nCoca Cola, Pepsi, Nutra Sweet Sued in California - 06 April 2004 - Lawsuits were filed in three separate California courts against twelve companies who either produce or use the artificial sweetener aspartame as a sugar substitute in their products. The suits were filed in Shasta, Sonoma and Butte County, California.\nRacketeering Charges Filed Against Companies for Manufacturing and Marketing Toxic Aspartame The National Justice League recently filed a\n$350 Million Class Action lawsuit on September 15, 2004 in San Francisco, California, Federal District Court against Nutrasweet, Monsanto, The American Diabetes Association and Dr. Robert H. Moser, former FDA Commissioner.\nThe FDA has received over 5,500 complaints against Aspartame (NutraSweet), which was legalized amid controversy regarding the capacity of this substance to alter brain hormone balances; some 9% of the complaints today involve serious neurological effects, including seizures. A recent major study by UCLA researchers of 109 patent-drug advertisements found 81% to be \"inaccurate, misleading and even dangerous.\" A General Accounting Office report found that 51.5% of patent drugs approved by the FDA between 1978 and 1986 had \"serious post-approval risks\" not disclosed on originally-approved package inserts, including \"heart failure, myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, respiratory depression, convulsions, seizures, kidney and liver failure, severe blood disorders, birth defects and blindness\"\n"}, {"score": 1498.2617, "uuid": "71dcafe4-64e0-55eb-b301-c70f14e81315", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0110wb-66-01030", "target_hostname": "www.helpforibs.com", "target_uri": "http://www.helpforibs.com/news/newsletter/081005.html", "page_rank": 1.1755246e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "Splenda, <em>artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em>, and IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome)", "snippet": "If you&#x27;re craving something sweet, you&#x27;re <em>better</em> off savoring a small portion of a treat made with real <em>sugar</em>. <em>Sugar</em> is not a health food, and if you want to indulge it should certainly be eaten in moderation.

I've heard Splenda is a \"natural\" alternative to real sugar. Is this true? Is it safe for IBS?\"\nUnfortunately, there is no such thing as a \"natural\" artificial sweetener, and there is no such thing as an artificial sweetener that is proven safe for IBS. Virtually all artificial sweeteners (as well as other chemical additives and preservatives) can provoke gastrointestinal upsets in people with IBS, as by definition we have more sensitive guts.\nSaccharine, Equal and Nutrasweet (both aspartame), sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (xylitol, malitol), and Splenda (sucralose) are the most popular artificial sweeteners in the US. They can all cause digestive side effects ranging from gas and bloating to severe abdominal cramps and urgent diarrhea. In some cases, they can provoke these symptoms in people who don't even have IBS, so imagine what they can do to you.\nSorbitol (and other sweeteners ending in \"ol\") are sugar alcohols, chemically extracted from fruits and vegetables but very poorly absorbed by the gut. It's this malabsorption that results in the low calorie count of sugar alcohols, but also in the dramatic digestive upheavals they can cause. Sugar alcohols are so likely to cause gas, cramping, and bowel dsyfunction that foods containing these sweeteners are often labeled with a warning about their side effects, and cautions against eating a large amount. Personally, I would caution you against eating any amount of a sweetener that's virtually guaranteed to wreak havoc on your gut.\nSplenda is the newest artificial sweetener on the market, and it's misleadingly marketed as \"natural\" because it's engineered from real sugar. In fact, the deceptive \"natural\" label has resulted in nine consumer class-action suits in several states and three federal commission complaints, and is also being being disputed by the American Sugar Association, which is suing Splenda's manufacturer. Splenda is a laboratory engineered altered molecule of sugar that replaces three hydrogen-oxygen groups on the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms. Yum! Splenda is not recognized by the body as a food substance, and it passes through the gut without being digested. I'd say this is about as far from a \"real\" food as you can get, and there is nothing remotely natural about it.\nSaccharine has had carcinogenic warnings about its use for years, and aspartame has generated thousands of consumer complaints to the FDA about side effects from its use. Aspartame must also carry a warning label for people who do not effectively metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine, one of aspartame's components. There aren't any clear cut long-term studies on saccharine's or aspartame's effects on gastrointestinal health, but there is a lot of anecdotal evidence that they can cause digestive upsets, particularly if you're already susceptible to these problems.\nIn general, anyone with IBS has a lot to lose and nothing to gain by using artificial sweeteners in even small amounts. The risks range from possible to guaranteed cramps, bloating, and diarrhea, and as everyone with IBS knows, once you provoke symptoms it is much more difficult to regain stability. If you're craving something sweet, you're better off savoring a small portion of a treat made with real sugar. Sugar is not a health food, and if you want to indulge it should certainly be eaten in moderation. For IBS, however, sugar is a much safer option than any artificial sweetener.\nAre you looking for other frequently asked questions about eating for IBS?

Data results and patients' IBS symptoms were correlated. Researchers found IBS patients had significantly higher IgG4 titers to beef, pork, lamb, and wheat compared to controls. These differences were maintained across all three subgroups. Antibody titers to potatoes, rice, fish, chicken, yeast, tomato and shrimps were not significantly different and no significant difference in IgE titers was observed between IBS and controls. No correlation was seen between the pattern of elevated IgG4 antibody titers and patients' symptoms, such as pain bloating and stool frequency.\nResearchers concluded serum elevated IgG4 antibodies to wheat, beef, pork and lamb may be the result of physiological damage caused by IBS. \"The response to exclusion diet based on elevated food-specific IgG4 in future studies may be useful in establishing the significance of these findings,\" wrote the study authors.

IBS puzzles doctors because medical tests usually don't show any abnormalities in the intestine, despite the presence of abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation and bloating. The two incidents -- the water-borne bacterial outbreak in Walkerton, Ont., in May 2000 and a food-borne viral outbreak at a scientific meeting in Newfoundland -- are providing researchers with an unprecedented look at what happens once the infections pass.\nThe circumstances surrounding the Walkerton outbreak are well-known. Municipal water contaminated with E. coli bacteria killed seven local residents and made thousands of others sick. Some of them are still sick, according to Marshall's report. He and his colleagues studied more than 2,000 Walkerton residents two to three years after the outbreak. One-third of those who got sick during the outbreak still had symptoms of IBS, including persistent diarrhea and abdominal pain. Just 10 per cent of people who did not get sick were found to have IBS.\nThe results lend a new note of credibility to the continuing health woes of Walkerton residents, Marshall says. \"We need to bring legitimacy to this sort of complaint, because a lot of people -- certainly in Walkerton -- who've had irritable bowel syndrome find themselves a bit dismissed by the medical system because they don't have any identifiable abnormality.\" Go here for more information about this study...\nLack of Lasting Effectiveness of Miralax for Constipation\nMiraLax has been shown to be safe and effective in a 14-day trial for constipation. This present investigation was designed to extend the treatment and safety experience with Miralax and to evaluate any lasting effectiveness during a 30-day post-treatment observation period.\nMethods: Study subjects met Rome II criteria for constipation and reported 3 bowel movements a week. They were treated with Miralax daily for 14 days. Treatment efficacy was defined by resolution of constipation symptoms as determined by the Rome II and stool frequency definitions during the treatment period. Thirty days after active treatment, 29 of 47 (61.7%) responded that they needed laxative treatment. Conclusion: Miralax relieved constipation in most treated study subjects, but during a 30-day post-treatment observation period, 61.7% had additional constipation treatment interventions.

It seems sweeter than other brands so a little goes a long way and with no bitter aftertaste. Highly recommended.\nStevia a natural sweetner7/23/11\nBy Ganesh Prajapat (Jaipur- INDIA)\nStevia is a very good source of sweetener. I don't know why the govt is lazy on this issue when steviosid is approved in many developed of countries. We are seeing that the no Govt research institute is doing research toward the development of the stevia quality in India. If we compare with china, the quality is not so good but due to the promotion and assistance of China Govt, China is far advance in stevia cultivation and stevioside manufacturing. I am using stevioside I did not find any bitter taste or health problem. One more thing no any big player/ business house is engaged in stevia /stevioside promotion. Still there is a question mark on GOVT side that why the GOVT are not approving stevia as a sweetener. If govt is finding that some thing is hazardous then put the paper in front of public that this is the problem that why govt is not approving the stevioside as a sweetener. Any way we have to go a long. I hope that the govt will approve it very soon. As a diabetic capital of world, India itself has a very good nice Market for the setvioside consumption. But it would be very pain full if Chinese setvioside will enjoy the Indian market if govt will approve the stevioside as a sweetener because our domestic supply of the stevioside and stevia leaves is near to zero.\nPlease find the initial details about the Stevia Cultivation. As we Know that Stevia is most profitable crop for the coming future. It is having the Stevioside content, the 300 time calorie free sweeter alternate of the sugar. The demand is increasing day by day due to the calorie free property. Which is good for the diabetic patients. We can provide you the complete solution for the stevia plantation.\nBrief details,\n1. Investment Rs 1,50,ooo/=( including the drip irrigation charges) only first year\n2. Annual maintenance Charge :- Rs 30,000/=\n3. Average Net Output at lower side:- Rs 1,50,000/year/Acre ( every year)\n4. Crop cycle:- 5 year plantation\n5. Buyback:- Rs 100/Kg\nWe have complete solution of setvia plantation knowledge and technology to buyback, including planting material to farm input.\nIf growers are willing to cultivate stevia 5 Acre in one lot. The fix cost will come down and the investment may come down . If there is subsidy of drip irrigation in your land in that condition The investment can comedown up to 1,25,000/-acre. For This growers will have to do the detail technical meeting. In the technical meeting we will discuss on all the aspect . Besides this we will also take growers on field visit of stevia crop. Then you will get an exposure. It will easy to growers to understand the crop.\nWe also supply good quality planting material. We assist growers in installation of drip system. We can also supply the organic manure. The most important one that we will give you buy back for the grower,s crop production.\nGood product!7/22/11\nBy Sonja (Summerfield, NC)\nThis Stevia has been a life saver as my son and I have transitioned away from honey and fruit!\nThank you!\nStevia7/17/11\nBy Therese (LA MESA, CA)\nI have tried other very expensive stevia liquid and this one by far has a better flavor!\nLove this STEVIA!!7/14/11\nBy Mary (Lancaster, CA)\nIt took some time to get use to stevia but now I can't live without it.

I bought this product for my husband who intensely dislikes stevia. Your website claimed that your stevia had a much better flavor than any other stevia out there. Sorry to say....it's just stevia. It tastes just like \"brand X\" that I've been using for years (which my husband doesn't like) The only difference between Body Ecology stevia and \"Brand X\" is the price.

We are seeing that the no Govt research institute is doing research toward the development of the stevia quality in India. If we compare with china, the quality is not so good but due to the promotion and assistance of China Govt, China is far advance in stevia cultivation and stevioside manufacturing. I am using stevioside I did not find any bitter taste or health problem. One more thing no any big player/ business house is engaged in stevia /stevioside promotion. Still there is a question mark on GOVT side that why the GOVT are not approving stevia as a sweetener. If govt is finding that some thing is hazardous then put the paper in front of public that this is the problem that why govt is not approving the stevioside as a sweetener. Any way we have to go a long. I hope that the govt will approve it very soon. As a diabetic capital of world, India itself has a very good nice Market for the setvioside consumption. But it would be very pain full if Chinese setvioside will enjoy the Indian market if govt will approve the stevioside as a sweetener because our domestic supply of the stevioside and stevia leaves is near to zero.\nPlease find the initial details about the Stevia Cultivation. As we Know that Stevia is most profitable crop for the coming future. It is having the Stevioside content, the 300 time calorie free sweeter alternate of the sugar. The demand is increasing day by day due to the calorie free property. Which is good for the diabetic patients. We can provide you the complete solution for the stevia plantation.\nBrief details,\n1.

So convenient and tastes great!\nSorry...it's a dud7/12/11\nBy mz bene (Laporte, CO)\nI would give the actual quality of the product 4 stars, except for the hype and build up on your site, prior to my purchase. I bought this product for my husband who intensely dislikes stevia. Your website claimed that your stevia had a much better flavor than any other stevia out there. Sorry to say....it's just stevia. It tastes just like \"brand X\" that I've been using for years (which my husband doesn't like) The only difference between Body Ecology stevia and \"Brand X\" is the price. BE stevia is half the size and twice the price. I'll stick with \"brand x\" and my husband can just keep using other sweeteners, I guess.\nstevia7/12/11\nBy deb (Santa Fe, NM)\nIt is the only stevia that I am not allergic to and my family likes the taste. I grow stevia but it is nice to have the concentrate when we travel and for convenience. I have been most happy with all the body ecology products I have purchased through the years. The stevia is still my favorite since it helps my family cut down on sugar.\nStevia7/12/11\nBy Dee (Germantown, TN)\nNo comparison to any other \"Stevia\". Hands down! No after taste or bitterness. And hey, I really want to keep my precious \"hubby\" around for a long, long, time!!!! So, I purchase the very best! He uses it in his coffee and anything he wants to \"sweeten up\" his sweet tooth! ( I still drink my 1/2 cup of coffee black, but who is counting?)\nHave a great life!\n"}, {"score": 1432.8007, "uuid": "e5bec5f5-dca6-5e8d-8405-190b260d3465", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0816wb-37-22960", "target_hostname": "www.chetday.com", "target_uri": "http://www.chetday.com/sugarartificialsweeteners.htm", "page_rank": 1.1718244e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "<em>Sugars</em> and Artifical <em>Sweeteners</em> in the Modern Diet", "snippet": "<em>Artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em> became very popular because of their low or zero calorie content, leading many to believe that it was <em>better</em> <em>than</em> using natural <em>sweeteners</em>; it also allowed diabetics to partake of sweet foods.", "explanation": null, "document": "by Mira Dessy\nSugars are an integral part of our modern lives. Whether a complex sugar like honey or a more refined sugar like High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) everyone consumes them to varying degrees. The amount and degree of refinement strongly determine the health impacts of various sugars. Complex, or unprocessed, sugars are slower to enter the bloodstream; the more refined the product, the more quickly your body metabolizes it.\nAdditionally, in order to metabolize sugar your body requires calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium which it pulls from other parts of the body, such as calcium from the bones. [everlastinglife.net]. Refined, or simple sugars include white sugar, brown sugar (white sugar with a light coating of molasses for color), HFCS, crystalline fructose, and concentrated fruit juices. Complex sugars include brown rice syrup, barley malt syrup, whole fruit puree or sauce, honey, maple syrup, unrefined cane juice, date sugar (made from ground, dried dates), agave syrup and blackstrap molasses.\nMany people include stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) in this category. Although it is not a sugar per se, stevia is a sweet herb from South America with up to 400 times the sweetness of white sugar and no calories. Also, stevia will not cause a rise in blood sugar.\nAccording to the Statistical Abstract of the United States, published by the U.S. Census Bureau, total per capita consumption of caloric sweeteners (which include cane sugar, beet sugar, and corn sweeteners) rose from 120.2 pounds in 1980 to 141.7 pounds in 2003. From 1980 to 2003 per capita sugar consumption declined from 83.6 pounds to 61.1 pounds however HFCS consumption increased from 19.0 pounds to 60.9 pounds. [U.S. Census Bureau, 2006]\nUnfortunately many of the calories consumed are hidden calories found in soft drinks, condiments and other food stuffs which most likely explains the decrease in sugar, increase in HFCS and overall increase in sweetener consumption. The World Health Organization recommends we eat no more than 10 percent of our calories from added sweeteners. Thus, for a 2,000 calories diet that equates to 200 calories, or 50 grams of sugar. [HealthyMe, November 30, 2007]\nSugar has calories; 1 level teaspoon weighs 4 grams and contains 15 calories. Regardless of whether it is complex or simple there is still an effect from caloric intake. While most of us like the sweetness of sugar we are not so fond of the caloric addition to our diet. In 1879 a researcher spilled a derivative of coal tar on his hand and discovered that it tasted sweet; this accident became known as saccharin, or Sweet-n-Low, and was the first sugar substitute. [WebMD, March 25, 2005]\nArtificial sweeteners became very popular because of their low or zero calorie content, leading many to believe that it was better than using natural sweeteners; it also allowed diabetics to partake of sweet foods.\nCurrently there are five sugar substitutes available; saccharine, aspartame (NutraSweetTM or EqualTM), sucralose (a chlorinated sugar also called SplendaTM), neotame (another form of NutraSweetTM), and acesulfame potassium (SunettTM and SweetOneTM).\nThere are a number of others that are currently pending FDA approval such as Alitame and Cyclamate (which was banned in 1970 and is currently seeking re-approval with the FDA) [Wikipedia] and Coca-Cola and Cargill are working together to develop a new sweetener based on stevia named RebianaTM. [American Botanical Council, 2007]\nOverconsumption of sweeteners has negative consequences for health. A recent study, published in November of 2007 showed that the gene that regulates active testosterone and estrogen can be turned off by eating too much fructose and glucose (sugar is composed of fructose and glucose). Glucose and fructose are metabolized in the liver which converts excess sugars to lipids.\nScientists have discovered that increased production of lipids shuts down the sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) gene reducing the amount of SHBG protein in the blood. With reduced SHBG protein the levels of testosterone and estrogen rise. These higher levels have been associated with acne, infertility, and polycystic ovaries among other illnesses. [Science Daily, November 21, 2007]\nAdditional research reveals that overconsumption of fructose causes a spike in levels of uric acid which can block the ability of insulin to regulate use and storage of sugar and other nutrients. This in turn can lead to obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. [ScienceDaily, December 14, 2007]\nArtificial sweeteners also have various negative health effects. In the 1970's the USDA tried to ban saccharine because of studies revealing a risk for cancer of the various organs including bladder, uterus, ovaries, and skin. In the late 1990's the Calorie Control Council stated that the main concern was bladder cancer in male rats, not people. As a result the ban was overturned. Now Aspartame has come under scrutiny with a recent study from a highly respected Italian cancer institute showing an increase in lymphomas, leukemias and breast cancer in rats.\nAs a result of this study the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) has downgraded aspartame, now labeling it \u0093everyone should avoid\u0094 instead of it's previous \u0093use caution\u0094 rating. [CSPINET, June 25, 2007] Research from Purdue University reveals that the ability of the body to \u0093count\u0094calories, based on sweetness, may be confused by artificial sweeteners. This research also showed that on a caloric count basis solid foods are more satisfying than thick liquids. [ScienceDaily, June 30, 2004]\nAll of the above clearly indicate that over-consumption of sweeteners, whether processed, unprocessed or artificial have negative effects on the body. The best option is to limit sugar intake and carefully read labels to understand which sugars are in the products you are consuming. If you choose to consume sweet foods, choose naturally sweet or sweetened, minimally processed foods.\nAbout the Author\nMira Dessy is the owner of Grains & More and teaches whole grain cooking and nutrition classes.

All rights reserved.\nSugar is a carbohydrate created naturally in fruits and vegetables, or by honey bees. Sweetening and flavor are its obvious functions, but it also plays a number of roles in baking. It comes in either DRY , such as granulated white or powdered sugar or brown; LIQUID , such as honey or molasses; or, ARTIFICIAL FORMS , and there are many types.\nSARAH SAYS: If you want to substitute one sugar for another, the rule of thumb is to use dry sugar for dry sugar and liquid sugar for liquid sugar. You can't exchange a dry one for a liquid one and vice versa without wrecking havoc, even if a substitution chart shows you otherwise. Also, each dry or liquid sugar has its own attribute, so when you substitute it, expect changes in the outcome.\nSugar History: Where did sugar first come from?\nAround 20,000 BC, people in the islands of the South Pacific were the first to find the sugar in sugar cane that grew naturally in their area. However, India was the first country to extract natural cane juice to make the first crude sugar, which they called \"gur\" (loosely translated as \"tasting sweet\") in 500 BC. From India, the knowledge of making sugar spread westward into the middle east and then to Europe by the Crusaders.\nFor hundreds of years, sugar was a highly prized and expensive \"spice\" that was used only in the homes of nobility and royalty. Christopher Columbus took sugar cane to plant in the Caribbean, leading to the production of sugar in the New World.\nIn the mid-1700's, a German scientist developed an alternative to sugar cane through the use of sugar beets. Since then, sugar beets are also grown and processed to produce sugar. There is no difference in the sugar produced from either cane or beet.\nToday, sugar is derived from sugar beets or sugar cane that are crushed and dissolved in water. The raw syrup is boiled down to concentrate it to a point where some fraction crystallizes. The remaining heavy syrup (see \"molasses\") is separated from the 95+% pure sugar. The crystals are further processed several times to increase its purity yielding, eventually, the pure white crystals we commonly use. Some other commonly used sugars are also produced during the processing.\nIn addition to beet and cane sugars, there are other types of sugar used in baking that come from different sources. After processing, the beet and cane sugars are chemically the same.\nSOURCES\nDESCRIPTION\nBeet Sugar\nA variety of garden beet extensively cultivated for the sugar which can be extracted from the roots.\nSugar Cane\nA tall grass whose sap yields sugar. Perhaps the oldest source of sugar known.\nFruit Sugars\nSugar from grapes and other fruit with a high sugar content.\nHoney\nFine white powder much less sweet than cane sugar, made from milk extract.\nRefined Sugar\nWhite crystals of either sugar beet or sugar cane.\nSugar Maple\nA North American tree from whose sap maple sugar is made.\nTurbinado OR Date Sugar OR Sucanat\nSugar from the sap of the date palm.\nMonosaccharides: (single sugar molecules)\nGlucose / Grapes, various fruits. Much less sweet than cane sugar.\nFructose / Fruit, honey. Fructose = granulated fructose = fruit sugar = levulose (fruit sugar)\nGalactose / Milk\nDisaccharides: (each molecule is made of two single sugar molecules)\nSucrose (glucose + fructose) = sugar / The technical name for sugar. A sweetener which is extracted from plants, such as beet or cane, producing natural sugar.\nLactose (glucose + galactose) / Milk extract. Fine white powder much less sweet than cane sugar.\nMaltose (glucose + glucose) / Bee. A sugar produced by the action of malt on starch.\nHow do fructose (one of the sugars found in fruit), lactose (a sugar found in milk) and sucrose (commonly table sugar) compare in sweetness?\nFructose\u00a0 ====>\u00a0 Sucrose ====>\u00a0 Lactose\n(sweetest) ==============>\u00a0\u00a0 (least sweet)\nHere are some questions that I am frequently asked about sugar. The answers may surprise you:\nIs the sugar in fruit better for you than table sugar?\nSugar is a natural product. The sugar in your sugar bowl is the same substance (sucrose) found naturally in sugar cane, sugar beets, apples, oranges, carrots and every other fruit and vegetable we eat. The body uses sugar from sugar cane and sugar beets in the same way as the sugars in fruit and vegetables. The sugars found in all carbohydrate foods all become glucose, fuel for the body.\nHow does refined sugar compare to the sugar in fruit?\nFrom a nutritional point of view, it doesn't matter what foods provide the sugars in our diet. Once digested, all sugars are put to the same good uses. All fruit and vegetables contain some sucrose along with other sugars, like fructose and glucose, in addition to fiber and a variety of vitamins and minerals. Most of the sugar added to foods is enjoyed as a part of foods from all four food groups, giving us both good nutrition and good taste.\nIs it better for you to eat honey instead of sugar?\nHoney, brown sugar, white sugar and maple syrup all have similar nutritional values. They all provide carbohydrate and energy, but insignificant amounts of vitamins and minerals. Sugar and other carbohydrate sweeteners play an important role in making other foods taste better, and, through their many uses in cooking, increasing the variety of foods available.\nIs sugar bleached to make it white?\nNo. There is no bleaching agent added at any time during the refining process. Pure sucrose crystals are naturally white.\nSARAH SAYS: When making lemon curd, sugar raises the coagulation point of the egg yolk. It also protects it from premature coagulation during the addition of the lemon juice. If the juice were added directly to the unprotected yolk, the yolk would partially coagulate and, when strained, a large percentage of it would be left behind in the strainer. Be sure to mix the sugar well with the egg yolks before adding the juice.\n"}, {"score": 1377.7734, "uuid": "51be135b-4086-5e5c-b8d1-cdfe201b93cd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1800wb-62-18029", "target_hostname": "my.blackmores.com.au", "target_uri": "http://my.blackmores.com.au/fitness-nutrition/sweeteners.html", "page_rank": 1.17536e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "The real deal on alternative <em>sweeteners</em> - myBlackmores", "snippet": "Substituting your soft drink for the diet version or choosing a <em>sweetener</em> instead of <em>sugar</em> feels a little more civilised. However, there\u2019s more to those little <em>white</em> tablets <em>than</em> meets the eye.", "explanation": null, "document": "Healthy Living\nReal deal on artificial sweeteners\nThe use of sugar substitutes is on the rise as manufacturers look for ways to cut calories without losing sweetness. But what kind of chemicals go into sugar substitutes? Are they safe? And are there any natural alternatives?\nWeight loss plans work best of all when they fit around your lifestyle. Depriving yourself of every little treat will make your diet feel like a military program. Substituting your soft drink for the diet version or choosing a sweetener instead of sugar feels a little more civilised.\nHowever, there\u2019s more to those little white tablets than meets the eye. Alternative sweeteners can be natural or artificial, calorie-free or just as calorific as sugar, and hundreds of times sweeter than sucrose, begging the question: do we really know what we\u2019re consuming?\nWhat are alternative sweeteners?\nAlternative sweetener is a catch-all phrase used to describe anything that is used in place of sugar \u2013 they could be artificial sweeteners, such as the tabletop sweeteners Equal, Splenda, Sugarless, Hermesetas and Sucrayl, and those used in diet products, or sweeteners derived from natural sources, such as Stevia.\nThere are a number of artificial sweeteners that have been approved for use in Australia by Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ). Aspartame, cyclamate, saccharin and sucralose are among the most popular. These provide the base for many diet food products, such as low-calorie yoghurts, desserts, soft drinks, biscuits and diet jellies.\nThey provide virtually no calories and the same sweetness as sugar for much smaller volumes. For this reason, sweeteners are often used with a bulking agent. You may find that some low-calorie products using artificial sweeteners have a different mouth feel to their sugared counterpart, or an aftertaste.\nStevia is a sweetener that comes from a natural plant source. It has been cultivated as a sweetener since the 1970s in Japan and is 300 times sweeter than sugar. Because stevia has a negligible effect on blood sugar it is popular with people on a low-carbohydrate diet.\nMaking the switch\nAccredited Practising Dietitian and exercise physiologist Michael Lawler told My Blackmores that, for him, the jury is still out on alternative sweeteners.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pro-side and a con-side to artificial sweeteners,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody has a lot of sugar in their diet and loves sweet food, they might still want to consume it while losing weight. In that case it can be a simple process of swapping over to diet versions of their favourite foods, creating a calorie deficit and losing weight.\u201d\nHowever, he argues that the \u201cultra sweet\u201d taste of sweeteners attunes our tastebuds to a higher level of sweetness. Our tastebuds will begin to crave a sweeter taste and everything else will seem bland in comparison. This can escalate so that we no longer taste the natural sweetness in our fruits and vegetables, Lawler said.\nOne common mistake is that slimmers sometimes think they can eat as much of a diet, sugar-free version of a product as they like and forget about the other nutrients.\n\u201cJust because a product is sugar-free doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s low calorie,\u201d said Lawler. \u201cManufacturers often have to bump up other ingredients to make up for the lack of sugar.\u201d\nIn addition to weight control, alternative sweeteners can be useful for people with diabetes. They tend not to raise blood-sugar levels because they are not carbohydrate. Your teeth will thank you for making the switch too, because artificial sweeteners don\u2019t contribute to tooth decay like sugar does.\n\u201cPersonally I think it\u2019s better to change your taste and wean yourself away from a high sugar diet. But for people who eat emotionally, artificial sweeteners can give them the space to deal with the reasons why they overeat before having to cope with a dramatically changed diet.\u201d\nBest used in moderation\nHowever, there are a few places where artificial sweeteners make an excellent alternative, Lawler said.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re used to having an alcoholic drink, then diet soft drinks are a great option. Also, night time is the worst time to eat sugar so, if you always get a sweet craving before bed, diet jelly or diet dessert can take the edge off. Having said that, frozen berries and natural yoghurt work just as well.\u201d\nWhat if you\u2019re training for your sport? There\u2019s no research to suggest that sweeteners can reduce athletic performance but if you are doing a lot of cardio work you shouldn\u2019t need to worry about eating some sugar.\nLawler, who is also an exercise physiologist, said that some sugar immediately after a training session can improve muscle recovery. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend artificial sweeteners to a lean runner or a bodybuilder because they need the carbohydrate.\u201d\nThe best diets are balanced, varied and include all the major food groups, and all of the My Blackmores menu plans are based on this principle.

Registered dietitians are now being given formal education by the Coca-Cola Company on how safe its ingredients are.\nThe credentialing arm of the American Dietetic Association, the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR), has approved a program created by the The Coca-Cola Company Beverage Institute for Health and Wellness .This covers what it calls \u201curban myths\u201d about the safety of food ingredients.

He is physician-in-chief at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, chief of the Pediatric Gastrointestinal and Nutrition Unit, and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Couldn\u2019t sound better, could it? But he has also received a great deal of money from industry sources \u00e2\u0080\u0094like artificial infant formula manufacturers Mead Johnson and Nestle Ltd. His study on optimal duration of breastfeeding was funded by Gerber Products. He also served as a paid expert witness for Gerber when they were sued for deceptive advertising. And he contributed to a brochure intended for children entitled \u201cVariety\u2019s Mountain\u201d produced by the Sugar Association.\nNow he\u2019s being sponsored by the Coca-Cola Company and telling dietitians that the ingredients in Coke which everyone is alarmed about are safe.

A new study found that even when the palate cannot distinguish between the artificial sweetener and sugar, our brain knows the difference.\nAt the University of California, San Diego, 12 women underwent functional MRI while sipping water sweetened with either real sugar (sucrose) or Splenda (sucralose).\nSweeteners, real or artificial, bind to and stimulate receptors on the taste buds , which then signal the brain via the cranial nerve. Although both sugar and Splenda initiate the same taste and pleasure pathways in the brain \u2014and the subjects could not tell the solutions apart\u2014the sugar activated pleasure-related brain regions more extensively than the Splenda did.\nIn particular, \u201c the real thing, the sugar , elicits a much greater response in the insula,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, psych\u00adia\u00adtrist Guido Frank, now at the Univer\u00adsity of Colorado at Denver. The insula, involved with taste, also plays a role in enjoyment by connecting regions in the reward system that encode the sens\u00ada\u00adtion of pleasantness.\nAlthough Splenda elicits less overall activity within the brain, the researchers were surprised to find that the artificial sweetener seems to inspire more communication between these regions. \u201cLooking at the connection between the taste areas, Splenda is stronger,\u201d Frank says. He suggests that when we taste Splenda, the reward system becomes activated but not satiated. \u201cOur hypoth\u00adesis is that Splenda has less of a feedback mechanism to stop the craving, to get satisfied.\u201d\nIf that theory plays out, there could be implications for those who use artificial sweeteners as a weight-control aid. Recent research indeed suggests a correlation between artificial sweetener intake and compromised health.\nIn one large survey, diet soda consumption was found to be associated with elevated cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk. A different study reveals a possible mechanism behind this effect: rats that were fed artificially sweetened yogurt in addition to their regular feed ended up eating more and gaining more weight than rats that ate yogurt with real sugar.\nThe study\u2019s authors suggest that exposure to an artificial sweetener may undermine the brain\u2019s ability to track calories and to determine when to stop eating.\nRead the entire article here.\n\u00a9 2008 Thanks for taking the time to read my blog.

Avoid them if you can. Here\u2019s our current preference (subject to change).\nStevia:\nWhy use stevia? It has a very low glycemic load and is very low in calories.\nI find that stevia has a bitter edge. While a drop or two may work in tea/coffee/smoothies, using it as the main sweetener in a dessert sucks. Among all the stevia brands, the least bitter is KAL liquid stevia. Powdered stevia of all kinds is bitter.\nLo han (Monk fruit extract) tastes a bit like light brown sugar and has zero bitterness. So it works well combined with stevia. I use SlimSweet which is 80% lo han. Here\u2019s the thing, though. It says one serving is 1/5 tsp and has zero calories. In other words, they are claiming that 1/5 tsp lo han is as sweet as 1 tsp sugar \u2013 i.e. it is five times sweeter than sugar.\nThat\u2019s nonsense. At most, it is two times sweeter than sugar. Besides, it\u2019s a very high-calorie sweetener.\nAs this reviewer on Amazon points out:\nIt is important to note that this product is not 100% calorie free, as the product label seems to claim. The front of the label states that this product contains \u201c.9 carbs per serving,\u201d which clearly means that SlimSweet contains slightly less than one gram of carbohydrates per serving. There is a very good reason that a serving of this product has been sized so that it contains slightly less than a gram of carb per serving: legally, if a serving of a processed food contains less than a gram of either fat, protein or carbohydrates, for whichever of them that is less than a gram, the manufacturer is not required to report its calories. This, however, is the unvarnished truth about carbohydrates, any carbohydrates: in all times and places, they have 4 calories per gram (technically, 3.8 calories, which rounds to 4.0). Even sugar alcohols and fiber officially have 4 calories per gram, even though they are counted as 0 calories by people on low-carb diets because the body can\u2019t digest them. For SlimSweet, then, a 1/5 teaspoon serving with .9 gram of carb means it contains not 0 calories, but 3.6 calories. That\u2019s not so bad if all you are doing is drinking tea or coffee and using a couple servings a day. But what if you want to bake with it? If so, you need to look at the larger picture: 1 tablespoon equals 15 servings (5 servings per teaspoon times three teaspoons per tablespoon), or 54 calories, and a cup of SlimSweet, which equals 16 tablespoons, is a whopping 864 calories.\nThat\u2019s even more calories than regular sugar, which has 720 calories.\nOn the positive side: Lo han has a low glycemic load and will not throw your blood sugar out of whack.\nDate sugar:\nIt\u2019s dried powdered dates. Not as sweet as regular sugar, but delicious and has some essential vitamins and minerals that sugar lacks.\n1 cup date sugar has 480 calories.\nBrown rice syrup is another sweetener I don\u2019t mind using once in a while. One cup has 800 calories.\nSo a good compromise is to use part Stevia, part Lo han, part date sugar/brown rice syrup or just Stevia and Lo Han.\nThis is a follow-up on our post on Artificial Sweeteners . While convinced that they need to be avoided, we\u2019ve also come to realise that all natural sweeteners are not made alike. Some, though marketed as \u2018natural\u2019, are not.\nAmong natural sweeteners, some are superior to others in terms of flavour and health benefits.\nWe did an inventory of the sweeteners in our pantry, and here\u2019s what we found:\nWe prefer some natural sweeteners to others. In our order of preference:\nNumero Uno in the flavour department. A good natural source of manganese and zinc \u2013 important allies of the immune system. Nutritional Profile .\nGrade B is darker, has a richer flavour, and is usually better for cooking.\nBonus: it\u2019s also cheaper than Grade A, which is lighter, milder, and used mainly for candy making. Maple syrup can be substituted for sugar in just about any recipe, except in dry dishes (like laddoos) where the sugar is added in the end.\nJaggery is sugar in its most unprocessed form \u2013 chemical-free and with a host of mineral salts missing in processed sugar. Sold in cakes or loaves, jaggery or gur as it is called in India is known as pingbian tang in China, and panela, panocha, pile, piloncillo and p\u00c3o-de-acar in various parts of Latin America.The closest substitute in the European and North American context is Muscovado sugar (also called Barbados sugar).\nPic: Cane Jaggery\nIn addition to cane jaggery, there is palm jaggery , and the most delectable of them all \u2013 date jaggery . Jaggery is also produced from the sap of the coconut palm and the sago palm. Indian Ayurvedic medicine considers jaggery to be beneficial in treating throat and lung infections.\nPowdered jaggery is a great sugar substitute and has a rich, caramel flavour.\nHow jaggery is produced\nWe get it in different flavours. Our favourites are orange blossom and blackberry. Honey is rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. To benefit from the enzymes present in honey, it should ideally be consumed in raw, unprocessed form.\nFor at least 2700 years, honey has been used to treat a variety of ailments through topical application, though it was not until modern times that the cause of infection was understood. Now, it is understood that the folk remedy of using honey to treat wounds has a scientific explanation: it acts as an antiseptic/antibacterial agent. As an antimicrobial agent honey has potential for treating a variety of ailments \u2026\nAntibacterial properties of honey are the result of the low water activity causing osmosis, hydrogen peroxide effect, and high acidity.\nHoney should not be fed to infants .\nIt frequently contains dormant endospores of the bacteria Clostridium botulinum. These endospores can transform into toxin-producing bacteria in the infant\u2019s immature intestinal tract, leading to illness and even death.\nA sweet syrup made from the Agave plant. It is what we add to tea, coffee or lemonade. It comes in the light and dark varieties and is less viscous and more neutral-tasting than honey.\nIt is suitable for vegans who avoid animal products like honey. It is sweeter than sugar, and hence you need less if using it as a substitute in cooking or baking. Agave nectar is a newly created sweetener, having been developed during the 1990\u2032s. It has the lowest glycemic index among all the natural sweeteners, and is suitable for diabetics.\nHow it is produced :\nInterestingly, the production of agave nectar is very similar to how a bee creates honey. The bee adds enzymes to the complex sugars of nectar, which changes it into the simple sugars making honey. It is also through enzymatic action that the complex sugar found in agave juice is changed into a simple sugar sweetener- Agave Nectar.\nThe raw agave juice is regularly harvested from living plants by Indian peoples native to central Mexico. To do so, they must slice off the top of the plant and hollow out its core. Then the plant is capped with a stone. The pineapple shaped agave plant secretes its nectar into the center of the plant, rather than into flowers like most plants do. It collects in the hollow center for several days, after which the milky white \u201cjuice\u201d is removed by ladle, one plant at a time. In a way it is similar to tapping a tree for maple syrup collection.\nor turbinado sugar.\nRaw cane sugar is minimally processed, granulated cane sugar that has not been tortured or molested in unmentionable ways unlike its white counterpart. Has a richer flavour, and more nutrients.\nCane sugar vs. beet sugar. What\u2019s the difference?\nOne comes from the sugar cane plant (which grows mainly in warm climates), one comes from beets (which grows in cooler climates). They are comparable in terms of sweetness and nutritional value.\nWhy is\nwhite\nvile sugar banned in Jai and Bee\u2019s home?\nIt has empty calories. The processing of sugarcane to make white refined sugar strips it of its vitamins and essential minerals.\nWhite sugar can cause critical growth-hormone deficiency, and depletes the body of potassium and magnesium. As mentioned above, white sugar gets into the bloodstream very quickly, causing rapid elevations in blood sugar levels. The constant rapid rise and fall of blood sugar levels from the continuous consumption of a never-ending supply of white sugar products, in addition to the physical damage caused, also wears the pancreas out. An excessive use of white sugar can cause hypoglycaemia and a host of other serious disorders. See The Dark Side of White Sugar .\nThe processes used to convert raw yellow or brown sugar to refined white sugar are harmful to health and the environment. This \u2018refining\u2019 process has many components.\n1. The raw sugar is bleached white. The impurities in the sugar are not removed. They, are rather, bleached by exposure to sulphur dioxide to look colourless , and make the sugar cosmetically look \u2018pure\u2019. This form of sugar is called mill white, plantation white, and crystal sugar, and is the most common form of sugar found in sugarcane-producing countries. Bleach is corrosive and known to have serious long-term health effects.\n2. In India and other parts of south Asia, the form of white sugar used is called blanco directo. It comes from precipitating many impurities out of the cane juice by using phosphatation \u2013 a treatment with phosphoric acid and calcium hydroxide.\n3. The white refined sugar we commonly find in Europe and North America is often made of beets. How is beet sugar processed?\nRefined sugar can be made by dissolving raw sugar and purifying it with a phosphoric acid method similar to that used for blanco directo, a carbonatation process involving calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide, or by various filtration strategies. It is then further decolorized by filtration through a bed of activated carbon or bone char depending on where the processing takes place.\nA quarter of all the white sugar in the U.S. market is filtered using bone char. What is it?\nBone char is made from the bones of cattle from Afghanistan, Argentina, India, and Pakistan. The bones are sold to traders in Scotland, Egypt, and Brazil who then sell them back to the U.S. sugar industry.\nWhen they are not passing sugar between cattle bones, they filter it using either granular carbon, or an ion-exchange system using resins. The resin is regenerated chemically, which gives rise to large quantities of unpleasant liquid effluents.\nSimply stated, in the quest for \u2018whiteness\u2019 associated with \u2018purity\u2019, most people are willing to have their food treated with nasty chemicals, then probably passed through layers of animal bones or resins that cause great ecological damage.\nSugar: Addiction and Dangers\nThere are a host of minimally refined sugars that have a better flavour and nutrient profile than white sugar, and can be substituted 1:1 in lieu of white sugar in any dish.\n1. Muscovado or Barbados sugar - moist texture, rich caramel flavour. Excellent in gingerbread or chocolate cake. Comes closest in taste to jaggery.\n2. Demerara \u2013 tastes like mild molasses and is a coarse medium-grain. Perfect for tea and coffee.\n3. Raw Cane or Turbinado Sugar. Slightly more refined than the above two. See pic above.\n4. Unrefined Dehydrated Cane Juice or Sucanat . Sugar cane juice that is dehydrated and crystallised.\nWhat is confectioner\u2019s sugar/powdered sugar/castor sugar/icing sugar?\nConfectioners\u2019, powdered, or icing sugar is granulated sugar that has been beaten, crushed, trampled, stomped, trodden, squashed, and ground into a fine powder. Because it tends to form clumps, confectioners\u2019 sugar is augmented with about 3 percent cornstarch to keep it loose and flowing.\nGrind raw cane sugar to a fine powder and add 1 tsp cornstarch per cup of granulated sugar.\nIt is a by-product of the sugar-making process.\nIt is high in iron, calcium and a host of minerals , and quite good for you. It is the element that gives gingerbread its rich deep flavour.\nThere are three types of molasses \u2013 unsulfured, sulfured and blackstrap. Stick to unsulfured .\nPic from here .\nIn Britain, molasses is sold and used as \u2018treacle\u2019. Other types of molasses are pomegranate molasses, sorghum molasses, and bead molasses, used to colour many Asian dishes.\nWe avoid buying brown sugar for two reasons:\n1. The brown sugar one commonly finds in the market, is simply white refined sugar with some sulphured molasses added.\n2. It clumps up and is hard to use after a while.\nWe used to keep a bottle of unsulphured molasses.\nWhenever a recipe calls for \u2018brown sugar\u2019, add 2 tbsps unsulfured molasses per cup of raw cane sugar \u2013 more molasses for dark brown sugar, less for light.\nA bottle lasts a long time. We lugged one bottle of molasses across several states over seven years.\nNow, we simply substitute brown sugar in a recipe with maple syrup, or 50:50 sugar and jaggery.\nAlso called sweetleaf, this member of the sunflower family has been used for centuries by native peoples in Paraguay and Brazil to sweeten their yerba mate and other stimulant beverages. It seems to have been a familiar herb in parts of south Asia as well, as its Sanskrit name madhura patra (sweet leaf) indicates.\nAs Paati demonstrates, it\u2019s quite easy to grow in a pot on your windowsill. Stevia is 300 times sweeter than sugar, and a leaf is enough to sweeten a cup of tea or coffee.\nStevia is calorie and carbohydrate free, and is interesting from the medical perspective as a natural sweetener for diabetics and those on carb-controlled diets. Ift is supposed to actually enhance glucose tolerance , and help in the treatment of obesity and high blood pressure. Stevia has been widely marketed and used in Japan since the \u201970s.\nHowever, the FDA (U.S. Food and Administration) has turned down three industry requests to use stevia in foods in the U.S. The alacrity with which the FDA banned stevia (based on an anonymous complaint) and its reputation for being an arm of the agricultural and big business lobbies led many to believe that the FDA ban is merely to protect the interest of the artificial sweetener industry. After all, artificial sweeteners have documented ill effects that the FDA seems not to mind.\nSee more about the \u201cstevia chronicles\u201d here .\nPic from here\nAs of now, in the U.S. and Canada (as also the European Union), stevia cannot be added to food products, nor can it feature alongside artificial sweeteners on food shelves. However, it can be sold in health food stores as a dietary supplement.\nThere\u2019s a lot of confusing and conflicting information about stevia. We turned to our most credible source \u2013 the CSPI (Center for Science in the Public Interest). Their newsletter Nutrition Action has this to say about stevia:\nHere\u2019 what troubles toxicologists:\nReproductive problems. Stevioside \u201cseems to affect the male reproductive organ system,\u201d European scientists concluded last year. \u2026\nCancer. In the laboratory, steviol can be converted into a mutagenic compound, which may promote cancer by causing mutations in the cells\u2019 genetic material (DNA). \u201cWe don\u2019t know if the conversion of stevioside to steviol to a mutagen happens in humans,\u201d says Huxtable. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a minor issue, but it clearly needs to be resolved.\u201d\nEnergy metabolism. Very large amounts of stevioside can interfere with the absorption of carbohydrates in animals and disrupt the conversion of food into energy within cells.\nThe bottom line: If you use stevia sparingly (once or twice a day in a cup of tea, for example), it isn\u2019t a great threat to you. But if stevia were marketed widely and used in diet sodas, it would be consumed by millions of people. And that might pose a public health threat.\nalias yucky, unhealthy, genetically modified crap marketed as \u2018natural\u2019 and subsidised by the U.S. tax payer.\n(In May 2006, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) threatened to file a lawsuit against Cadbury Schweppes for labeling 7 Up as \u201cAll Natural\u201d, despite containing high fructose corn syrup. While the FDA has no definition of \u201cnatural\u201d, CSPI claims that HFCS is not a \u201cnatural\u201d ingredient due to the high level of processing and the use of at least one genetically modifed (GMO) enzyme required to produce it. On January 12, 2007, Cadbury Schweppes agreed to stop calling 7 Up \u201cAll Natural\u201d. Source: Wikipedia )\nHFCS is everywhere \u2013 in sodas, in sports drinks, in cookies, in savoury products, third on the ingredient list on a packet of ordinary bread.\nUntil the 1980s, Coca Cola was made with cane sugar. Then, they switched to high fructose corn syrup. Coke in Mexico is still made with cane sugar. It supposedly tastes much better than American Coke. Same company, two products. It is perfectly legal to bring a bottle of Mexican Coke to the U.S.\nHowever, Coca Cola has been fighting tooth and nail to stop its own product from another market being brought here , using some legalese.\nWhy are the Coke executives having a cow? The answer lies in the fact that HFCS is so much cheaper than sugar. The reason is two fold \u2013 artificially inflated sugar prices and heavy subsidies to the corn lobby from the taxpayer to the tune of $22.7 billion in 2005. That\u2019s why it\u2019s cheaper for Coca Cola to make Coke with cane sugar in Mexico, and HFCS in the U.S.\nKate at the Accidental Hedonist explains it better than we can:\nA 1/10th of a cent increase in sweetener, per serving, would cost Coca-Cola roughly $122,423,790 per year.\nHow does this elaborate system of scamming the tax payers and damaging their health to pad corporate pockets work? She explains it in detail .\nIn a nutshell:\nWe inflate the cost of sugar, lower the cost of corn, and Archer Daniels Midlands buys an excessive amount of corn at excessively low costs in order to make HFCS.\nIf you want to get HFCS out of our foods, have the government take care of the Tariffs, the subsidies, or both.\nSee also Greg Critser\u2019s Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World.\nWhat are the health effects of fructose?\nStudies are investigating how unlike other types of carbohydrate made up of glucose, fructose does not stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin. Fructose also fails to increase the production of leptin, a hormone produced by the body\u2019s fat cells.\nBoth insulin and leptin act as signals to the brain to turn down the appetite and control body weight. And in another metabolic twist, fructose also does not appear to suppress the production of ghrelin, a hormone that increases hunger and appetite.\nIn short, unlike other carbohydrates, fructose fails to activate the hormones that tell the body that it is satiated. Consuming a diet high in fructose can lead to over-eating and asociated risks like obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes.\nLinks:\n"}, {"score": 1321.5568, "uuid": "2da3afb2-a80b-5d66-bc0e-422d2c524da9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0900tw-10-03114", "target_hostname": "balancedbites.com", "target_uri": "http://balancedbites.com/2011/04/the-dish-on-sugar-sweeteners.html", "page_rank": 1.2189681e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "The Dish on <em>Sugar</em> &amp; <em>Sweeteners</em> | Balanced Bites | Holistic &amp; Paleo Nutrition", "snippet": "<em>Sweeteners</em> that come from nature <em>are</em> always <em>better</em> to consume <em>than</em> those that come from a lab or factory.

But then again, it may just trigger a repulsive response in some people who are always counting their calories.\nAside from that, I like an occasional trip to HTB. It\u2019s a good place with lots of food choices, and depending on the day, you may find your favorite dish served. And if you are so used to paying for your food (and drinks) without any thought to it then you might as well get use to the new idea on paying for your beverages separately which took effect sometime in 2010. And if you don\u2019t care for beverages then there is water, for free. Whether or not the water is filtered I can\u2019t tell you. Other than that, you can make yourself \u201cfeel at home\u201d.\nIn any case, on my recent visit, I excitedly helped myself to lots of cornbread, taco and beef, green salad, and so on. After the main course, I contemplated on what dessert to get but noticed a small white rectangular-shaped (3.5\u201d x 5.5\u201d x 1.5\u201d) porcelain with three different colored packages stacked neatly upright. Curiously, I pulled out each of the different colored packages and realized that they were artificial sweeteners.\nThe pink package was the Sweet \u00e2\u0080\u0098N Low brand. It had a musical bar with the treble clef and had a statement that says, Zero Calorie Sweetener. On the other side of it, in very tiny prints, are the ingredients and few pertinent information.\nThe yellow package was the Splenda brand and it had the \u201cNo Calorie Sweetener\u201d statement in smaller fonts. Just like the Sweet \u00e2\u0080\u0098N Low, the reverse side indicated the ingredients except that it did not have saacharin, cream of tartar, and calcium silicate.\nAnd the white package was HTB\u2019s brand. The name, Home Town Buffet was boldly printed on both sides and looked as if the words were ready to jump at you. In smaller fonts, it had \u201cPure Sugar\u201d printed on one side only, and showed no other information i.e. nutritional facts or net weight, and I wondered why.\nEach of these packages had something that got me really curious. Starting with the pink package is the ingredient saacharin or code E954. Several years ago I read that it was not safe to consume it because it causes bladder cancer. However, in 2001 the FDA repealed it. Then in December 14th, 2010, the EPA eventually was convinced and publically announced that it is not a potential hazard.\nThen, there is Splenda and its sucralose (E955). It is 600 times as sweet as sucrose, twice as sweet as saccharin, and 3.3 times as sweet as aspartame. FDA approved its usage in 2006, and is used in over 80 other countries since 2008. Out of the three, Splenda is the only one says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098suitable for diabetes\u2019. And why is that? According to McNeil Nutritional LLC, it indicated that \u00e2\u0080\u0098...there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for either sucralose or its hydrolysis products...\u2019. As a result, the American Dietetic Association highly advocated its usage and the FDA approved it. Containing no calories and does not promote dental cavities, it is found in over 4,500 food and beverage products today which triggers two questions, why does HTB have it own \u201cpure sugar\u201d package? And what type of sugar is it?\nBetween sugar from cane and sugar from beets, cane sugar is a better choice which makes me wonder if HTB\u2019s \u201cpure sugar\u201d is from beet sugar. So, the question I had in mind was, why carry all three? Is all about helping diabetics and/or people on diet? Because in my opinion, HTB surely is not a place for people who is trying to be on diet nor is it for those trying to get off diabetes. And what about having to feel at ease that Sweet \u201cN Low\u2019s saacharin or Splenda\u2019s sucralose are safe to use? Not everyone is convinced that artificial sweeteners are good for the body. But if some day we don\u2019t find real pure sugar on our table, then at least, we know the artificial sweeteners have won the war.\nOthers are also reading...\n"}, {"score": 1305.0239, "uuid": "cfa49fd4-badf-5a54-8ac0-4b2ed7825eb6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1500wb-56-20624", "target_hostname": "energybulletin.net", "target_uri": "http://energybulletin.net/print/59118", "page_rank": 1.1709494e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Producing <em>sweeteners</em> locally", "snippet": "As many <em>artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em> (notably neotame, aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose) <em>are</em> sweeter by volume <em>than</em> <em>sugar</em>, and store reasonably well, they may be easier trade goods <em>than</em> <em>sugar</em> itself.", "explanation": null, "document": "Published on Energy Bulletin ( http://energybulletin.net )\nProducing sweeteners locally\nOriginal article: http://tclocal.org/2011/09/producing_sweeteners_locally.html\nby Simon St. Laurent\nOne of the most common complaints about the industrial age is its constant and seemingly ever-growing use of sweeteners. Whether it was cheap sugar (and rum) in the early 1800s, saccharin in the early 1900s, or high-fructose corn syrup in the late 20th century, sweeteners have had a bad\u2014but tasty\u2014reputation.\nIn a local context, however, sweeteners are extremely important. Many of the local fruits that contain Vitamin C, for instance, are difficult eating unless sweetened. Aronia Melanocarpa is called \"chokeberry\" for a reason. Black currants are difficult eating off the bush. The more familiar perennial rhubarb also becomes far more enjoyable with sweetening. Even in less extreme cases, sweeteners can certainly add enjoyment to foods otherwise too bitter or too bland to be attractive. Sugar is also very important in preserving food, where it creates a hostile environment for bacteria as well as a delicious treat.\nMany different sweeteners are available today, though they may become more or less important in localization or energy descent situations. Some require industrial facilities and major energy inputs, and a few are dangerous, but many familiar sweeteners will likely remain available into even an uncertain future.\nSugar and Molasses\nSugar cane, a tropical plant, doesn't grow in Central New York. United States sugar producers are in Louisiana and Florida, though sugar refineries have been prominent features of port cities along the coasts. Modern sugar production relies on energy-intensive industrial processing and distribution. Cane sugar's long history, however, suggests that it and its by-product molasses can still be valuable with reduced processing, as extracting sugar is relatively simple and can be fueled with the cane that created it[1]. Sugar distribution and storage are similarly simple, as it is easily packed for safe storage.\nSugar produced from beets has many of the same issues as cane sugar, but unlike sugar cane, sugar beets can be grown in New York State. However, the quantity of sugar beets currently grown is small enough that the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service[2] doesn't even offer sugar beets as a query option for New York. Today, sugar beets receive more industrial processing than does sugar cane, despite containing 17% sugar while cane contains 10%. Unlike cane, beets cannot easily be processed using their byproducts for fuel. (The byproducts are typically used as animal feed.) Sugar beets are also typically used as a crop in rotation, so the yield per acre is substantially lower than that of cane.[3] Sugar beets can be processed at home on a small scale by chopping, boiling, and evaporating, however.[4]\nFigure 1. Sugar beet field, Sweden ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from Dag Endresen.)\nThe primary questions about sugar in an energy descent situation revolve around price, distribution, and quality.\nThough sugar in the United States is expensive relative to sugar in the rest of the world (roughly double the Canadian price because of American import quotas[5]) it remains a remarkably cheap commodity by historical measures. As the energy costs of sugar refining climb, those prices will likely climb. Diversion of sugarcane to ethanol production may also shrink the available supply of sugar substantially, also increasing the price.\nIf energy costs climb, the cost of distributing sugar, especially cane sugar coming from a distance, will climb. Sugar works well with slower and less energy-demanding forms of transport, but transitions to new distribution patterns may take time. Disruptions may also be more difficult because of the longer supply chain of cane sugar.\nWhile less-refined sugar has become a high-end product recently, most people still expect their sugar to be a pure white with a relatively neutral taste and predictable cooking behavior. If the extra energy cost of refining to white sugar climbs, more people may need to get used to less-refined sugar.\nIt may be possible to create a substantial sugar beet industry in New York State\u2014or it may make sense to count on sugar's relatively easy tradability to keep it available.\nCorn sweeteners\nCorn-based sweeteners thrive today because of a combination of the import quotas noted above and subsidies for corn production. Dent corn is converted into corn starch by a wet millling process and then treated with enzymes to produce corn (glucose) syrup. High-Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) is made by an additional enzyme process to convert much of that glucose to fructose.[6] This is a strictly industrial energy intensive process:\nCorn wet milling is the most energy intensive industry within the food and kindred products group, using 15% of the energy in the entire food industry. After corn, energy is the second largest operating cost for corn wet millers in the United States. A typical corn wet milling plant in the United States spends approximately $20 to $30 million per year on energy.[7, page 3]\nFigure 2. Wet corn mill ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from Jim Hammer.)\nWhile dent corn can be grown locally, the industrial scale and energy requirements of wet corn milling seem to put local corn syrup out of reach. There was a corn wet mill in Montezuma, New York, just up Cayuga Lake, but it closed in 1986.[7, page 73] Like sugar, corn syrup can be easily transported and stored.\nArtificial sweeteners\nIf you count the extremely toxic \"Sugar of Lead\" (lead acetate), artificial sweeteners have been around for thousands of years, though the modern history usually begins with saccharin in 1879. While it is likely possible to create most of these sweeteners in the laboratory facilities available at Cornell, most of them are produced today in large volume at chemical plants.\nAs many artificial sweeteners (notably neotame, aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose) are sweeter by volume than sugar, and store reasonably well, they may be easier trade goods than sugar itself. Xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, the sweet alcohols, are roughly as sweet as sugar and are useful both to sweeten food for diabetics and potentially as a tooth decay preventative.\nLead acetate deserves special attention as a danger, as it is not difficult to synthesize from lead and has commonly been used as an adulterant in foods and drinks.\nHoney\nHoney is a commonly available sweetener that can be produced in large quantities in the Finger Lakes region. Beekeepers encourage hives to produce more honey than they need to survive the winter, then take the extra honey for human consumption.\nBeekeeping is a complex art, though it scales down to the household level more easily than the production of many other sweeteners. Keeping hives alive has become more difficult in recent years with the spread of pests, notably varroa mites, but the infrastructure and learning investments required to become a successful beekeeper are still fairly small.\nUntil the mid-19th century, beekeepers used hollow logs or straw houses, called skeps, for their bees. While these worked, they didn't allow beekeepers to inspect the hive for disease, and the hive usually had to be destroyed to retrieve the honey. Because of disease issues, skeps are illegal in the US.\nMost beekeepers use Langstroth hives, rectangular boxes filled with frames in which the bees make their home. So long as beekeepers maintain precise distances between equipment inside of the hive, the bees will avoid gluing everything together. This flexibility makes it simpler for beekeepers to inspect the hive, as well as to add and remove equipment to gather honey. Langstroth equipment does require a fairly substantial investment, and most beekeepers buy sturdy frames filled with wax or plastic foundation printed in a hex pattern. This gives bees a bit of a head start, and reinforcements in that foundation make it much easier to extract honey by spinning the frames mechanically.\nFigure 3. Bees on framed comb, honey top right, brood lower left. (Photo Simon St.Laurent.)\nIt is possible, though slow, to replace frames with bars with a simpler strip of wax on the bottom and have the bees build their comb on that, but the frames will be less regular and more difficult to use with an extractor. Taking that idea further, some beekeepers are using top bar hives. These hives fit into a single box organized horizontally rather than stacked vertically. The bees build their own comb, and beekeepers who want to collect the honey press or cut the comb instead of spinning it. This destroys the comb, requiring the bees to work harder to make new honey, but requires less dedicated equipment.\nWhile much beekeeping equipment can be built from readily available wood and metal, two pieces of the beekeeping system are more difficult. The foundation is generally manufactured, though it can be created on a smaller scale using old equipment like some of that on display in the Dyce Lab at Cornell. The harder challenge is the supply of bees and queens. New bees and queens can be raised in the north, but at present most nurseries for bees are considerably farther south and rely on express delivery services. Local breeding has become more popular as a way to improve bees, so this may not remain an issue for very long.\nBeekeepers are facing an ever-wider variety of diseases and parasites. While Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) made headlines, most beekeepers are battling a variety of problems, most notably varroa mites. Chemical solutions can keep mites at bay, but mites seem likely to be a permanent feature of beekeeping at this point. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) mixes chemical and other approaches, focusing on keeping hives going. Inspection, now an optional event in New York State, may become especially important again if beekeepers have to rely on their own production of bees rather than importing new ones from the south.\nWhile some beekeepers might find warmer weather convenient, changing weather patterns, especially if extreme weather becomes more common, could create difficulties. Rain and snow can keep bees in their hives and prevent their collecting food, while drought can delay or hinder plants from flowering. Bees also fly much less when temperatures are 90\u00b0 F or higher, staying home to cool the hive. Bears moving north present another challenge.\nMaple Syrup and Maple Sugar\nUpstate New York has been producing maple syrup and maple sugar for centuries. Native Americans taught European settlers about collecting and concentrating sap, and Europeans gradually technologized and standardized the process. It was a key part of the development plan for early Cooperstown, though visions of maple fortunes faded quickly[8], and the energy and infrastructure challenges of making maple syrup have kept it from competing with cane or beet sugar. (Beet syrup starts at a concentration of 6 parts water to 1 part sugar, cane syrup starts at 10:1, and maple sap is at 40:1.)\nWhile many modern maple syrup producers use plastic tubing to collect the sap, simple metal taps and buckets can provide a sustainable (if labor-intensive) collection system. Even a simple pot can work for boiling down sap, though large flat pans and especially more complex flue pans make it much easier to evaporate sap down to syrup. An indoor wood stove already used for heat can boil syrup at the household level, while a sugarhouse with vents is likely a better idea for a larger pan. A sugarhouse will need a dedicated supply of wood (or other fuel), but that is frequently available in the same areas as maple stands.[9]\nWhile sugar maples (Acer saccharum) are the traditional tree for maple syrup production, red, black, and some silver maples can also be tapped, as can box elders and birches.\nAt any scale, however, maple faces some challenges. The flow of sap depends on the weather, particularly on the contrast between daytime and night time temperatures. Sap flows during the day, carrying sugar from the roots. A winter that turns too suddenly into spring can disrupt maple production, as can seasonal storms that make it difficult to collect and evaporate syrup. The short season and its unreliability make maple syrup a risky product. While it is not difficult to preserve maple syrup, its greater water content makes it more likely to spoil than honey or sugar. (Maple syrup can be made into maple sugar, at a large energy cost in additional refining.)\nFigure 4. Evaporating syrup in Marathon, NY (photo Simon St.Laurent)\nMaples also face environmental challenges. Climate change may shift the range northward, giving hickories and oaks an advantage while limiting maples. Long-term changes in spring weather patterns could also complicate or reduce the maple season further. The Asian Long-Horned Beetle, already present in New York City, attacks and weakens maple trees and a variety of other species. Larvae tunnel through the wood, weakening the tree.[10] These beetles may reduce the number of healthy maples and make it more difficult for new maples to survive.\nSorghum\nSweet sorghum, though traditionally grown further south, can produce a syrup similar to molasses, as well as silage or forage for animals. Some farmers are experimenting with it in Tompkins County as a cover crop and animal feed today, and it may be an appealing option if climate change extends the growing season.\nProcessing sorghum for syrup requires stripping the leaves and seed head off the cane, then squeezing the juice out of it and evaporating and skimming that juice. Crushing the cane is generally done with a simple mill, and the resulting juice yields about a gallon of syrup from ten gallons of juice.[11]\nFigure 5. Sorghum mill ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from g-s-h.)\nFruit Juices\nFruit juices and concentrates, and even applesauce, are classic sweeteners. While whole fruits are, of course, a delicious way to enjoy fruits, juicing and similar processes make it much easier for people to consume fruits that are bruised, damaged, or simply useful as a background sweetener rather than as the primary flavor. Commonly available apple and grape juices, both products of Upstate New York, are regularly used to provide bulk and sweetness to more expensive juices like cranberries, blackberries, blueberries, or (more recently) pomegranate.\nLike fruits, fruit juices can be canned or frozen. They require more energy input to preserve than do sugar or honey, but are easier to create with ordinary pots or pans or with simple tools like steam juicers. They scale up to greater volumes easily as well.\nMalt\nGrains are another common source of sweetness. Malting grain is a fairly complex process involving drying, storing, adding water, partially germinating, and then processing and often mashing. Today most malting relies on industrial equipment and purpose-built malting floors, but the basic steps can be done with simple equipment on a wide variety of scales.\nFigure 6. Malting floor ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from Chris Sharp)\nMalt is most commonly used as a fermentation base for beer and whiskey, but it is also a key component in malted milks, malt vinegar, and malt candies. Barley is the most common grain used for malting. Many grains are bred specifically to provide the enzymes needed for the malting process.\nStevia\nStevia is a relative newcomer, at least in the United States. The plant Stevia rebaudiana, originally from South America, has leaves that are approximately 30 times sweeter than sugar, and its core sweetening compounds are approximately 250 times sweeter. The Food and Drug Adminstration has allowed the sale of stevia as a food supplement but not as an ingredient, though stevia-derived sweeteners are now legal for use.\nFigure 7. Stevia plant. ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from Irene Kightley)\nStevia's climate expectations limit its use for large-scale plantings in Tompkins County. However, it may prove useful as a household-scale sweetener, especially for people who have difficulties with other sweeteners. It can grow as a window plant, getting the sun that it needs while avoiding the cold. Stevia leaves can be used directly as a sweetener without further processing.\nAlcohol\nAll of the natural sweeteners except stevia can be converted into alcohol through fermentation, possibly followed by more energy-intensive distillation. Malt is traditionally used for beer; fruit juices for wine; hard cider, and brandies, honey for mead; and sugar and molasses for rum. In addition to its intoxicating qualities, alcohol can be used as a preservative and to sterilize medical equipment and wounds.\nIn an energy descent situation, however, sugars are perhaps dangerously attractive as an easy source of alcohol for fuel. Competition between food and energy uses of sugar will likely increase demand (and prices) for sweeteners.\nPolicy Suggestions\nSome projects supporting local sweetener production already exist. Cornell's Master Beekeeper program and its work with maple products in the Arnot Teaching and Research Forest focus on honey and maple syrup. Cornell Cooperative Education offers sessions on fruit juices and preserving.\nSome sweeteners, notably cane sugar and corn syrup, are unlikely ever to become local products, and most of the artificial sweeteners are unlikely to become economical local products.\nSorghum and stevia originated in far warmer climates than Tompkins County has to offer, but both are worth exploring in different contexts. For now, sorghum seems useful primarily as a cover crop, with some potential for use as a sweetener. Stevia is more promising because of its ability to grow as a houseplant, and could be an excellent target for Cooperative Extension projects and local nursery development.\nThere is one great danger here, something that local public health officials should watch for: the possible return of lead acetate. At present, this threat is discussed mostly in the context of imported food, but it could just as easily surface in local food. Watching for symptoms and developing testing protocols could become much more important if the price of sweeteners climbs.\n"}, {"score": 1301.2388, "uuid": "271d29dd-0815-5a53-97ae-8a2c4bbde916", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1201tw-25-05729", "target_hostname": "www.kitchenstewardship.com", "target_uri": "http://www.kitchenstewardship.com/2012/02/06/monday-mission-seek-and-destroy-artificial-sweeteners/", "page_rank": 1.4497422e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Monday Mission: Seek and Destroy <em>Artificial</em> <em>Sweeteners</em> | Kitchen Stewardship", "snippet": "I\u2019ve made some breakfast Dessert here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;xabvOm \u2013 ONLY using 1&#x2F;2c real unrefined suagr in each one\u2026 I\u2019m sooo glad you <em>are</em> doing this post about <em>artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em>.

Let me tell you how all this got started:\nMy son, the saver, brought home an empty bottle from a birthday celebration in his first grade room just before Christmas. (He wanted to make something out of it, in case you were wondering.) I knew there was nothing good inside, but I had artificial food colorings on the brain that week after an article at Sorta Crunchy got me sorta thinking.\nI absent mindedly read the ingredients and nearly bruised my jaw on the dresser when I got to the end and saw not only Red 40, which I expected, but sucralose. In case you\u2019re not up on evil things one might find on an ingredients label, sucralose is Splenda, one of the newer no-calorie artificial sweeteners to hit the market.\nThe Line\nAlthough I\u2019m guessing I don\u2019t come across very lenient online, I really let a lot of things slide in real life. I usually just cringe at high fructose corn syrup rather than banning it (when others are serving, not at home!).

I hate when kids are given juice, but I know it\u2019s a fun treat for a party.\nHowever.\nEveryone has to have some un-crossable, non-negotiable, never-compromise-on-them lines.

I can\u2019t even figure out why the punch had sucralose in there since the first ingredient was still high fructose corn syrup.\nThe Birth of a Juice Activist\nThe bottle was empty.\nThe line had been crossed.\nI had to do something about it.\nI realized that education was the only way out of this chemically sweetened mess, so I decided to talk to Paul\u2019s teacher to see if she would let me share information with the classroom parents about how to find artificial sweeteners on labels and why they\u2019re no good for kids.\nAll of this, plus another story that I\u2019ll share later this week in which someone will pee their pants , was the genesis of the entire week of school food advocacy here at Kitchen Stewardship. I\u2019ll post a \u201c juice decoder \u201d to help people \u2013 not most of you, I know, but rookies \u2013 determine what juice is perhaps okay to drink and what is totally unacceptable, especially for kids.\nSo if you know all this stuff, and you\u2019d never touch artificial sweetener with a 10-foot pole anyway, I offer a challenge to you this week to do some real food evangelizing. Teach someone else how to read a label and avoid fake sweeteners , or better yet, teach someone how to buy food without labels.\nWelcome to My House\u2026\nAs for me, I\u2019m inviting the parents from the entire class over to my virtual home tomorrow, and we\u2019re talking about juice.\nI want to teach all parents how to help their kids be healthier, and avoiding artificial sweeteners is such an easy place to start. I was telling some blog colleagues about how I was getting my undies in a bunch about juice at school, rolling my eyes and saying, \u201cYep, I\u2019ll make a name for myself quickly as the crazy food lady, yikes.\u201d (Remember that we\u2019ve only lived here two months!)\nThey seemed to want to counsel me to simply teach my own kids how to avoid the junk rather than to try to change school policy so that they\u2019re not presented with the junk. As much as I appreciate and agree with the idea of kids having knowledge and agency to take care of themselves \u2013 and I do that sort of education, too \u2013 I just can\u2019t get over the fact that I might have the opportunity to help other families improve their health! I can\u2019t help it. I just have to be a teacher wherever I go.\nMy \u201cvoice\u201d tomorrow might be a little odd for those of you who are always around, however, since I\u2019ll be talking to a different audience, some of whom certainly drink diet sodas and think nothing of it. I\u2019ll tread lightly and focus on the kids.\nWho are YOU going to teach this week?\nI\u2019d love to see more of you!\u00a0 Sign up for a free email subscription or grab my reader feed .

Their popularity is fueled by America\u2019s obsession with weight loss.\nArtificially-sweetened and no-calorie sodas may indeed help consumers lose weight -- if they count calories and burn them through exercise, according to Michael Jacobson , executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI).\n\u201cI think a lot of people think, \u2018Oh, I'll drink this diet soda and the pounds will melt off.\u2019 Losing weight is so hard. These artificial sweeteners are not magical,\u201d said Jacobson.\nAnd some of them may actually be harmful, depending on the medical study you believe.\nThere has been a \u201ccloud of doubt\u201d over aspartame, marketed as Equal and NutraSweet in a blue packet, since it was approved by the FDA thirty years ago and a small percentage of people report side effects such as headaches and dizziness as a result of consuming products with aspartame, according to Jacobson.\nMore significant were the first-ever independent studies of aspartame, conducted by Italian scientists , Jacobson said. Their research showed that aspartame caused cancer \u2013 lymphoma and leukemia -- in laboratory rats. But the risk of illness to humans who consume small amounts of aspartame appears to be minimal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a death sentence if you drink Diet Coke with aspartame,\u201d said Jacobson. \u201cThere's been no obvious increase in cancer rates since artificial sweeteners became widely consumed. There's no epidemic of new cancers, so the risk is very low if these really do cause cancer.\u201d\nSaccharine -- better known as Sweet'N Low in the pink packet --\u00a0is well-studied, but results are mixed.\n\u201cWith saccharine, there are question marks about it. There have been many studies showing that it causes cancer in animals and a couple of studies showing it causes cancer in people, and then there are many other studies showing that it doesn't cause cancer,\u201d said Jacobson.\nTruvia and PureVia , brand names of a sweet substance derived from the stevia plant, are too new on the market and inadequately studied, said Jacobson. Just because a product claims to be from a natural source does not prove that it is safe, according to the CSPI .\nThe closest Jacobson came to calling an artificial sweetener unsafe was when he warned against acesulfame K, a sweetening agent found in soda and chewing gum.\n\u201cI\u2019m very dubious of it,\u201d said Jacobson. \u201cTwenty years ago we urged the FDA not to approve it and the agency dismissed our concerns.\u201d\nJacobson\u2019s pick of all the packets? The yellow one.\n\u201cIf you insist on having \u2018diet\u2019 this or \u2018diet\u2019 that, Splenda or sucralose is probably the safest. It has not caused cancer or significant other problem in the animal studies that have been conducted. Too bad it is often mixed with acesulfame K which has real serious question marks, and shouldn\u2019t be on market,\u201d said Jacobson.\nThat\u2019s welcome news to Pinckert, who said she eats fewer sweet foods throughout the day thanks to her Splenda-saturated coffee.\n\u201cI figure if my one vice is the least harmful of all the sweeteners, then I feel okay about it,\u201d said Pinckert.\nJacobson said seltzer water, milk, or just plain water are safer and healthier options for drinks.\n\u201cStill, I think drinking a diet soda is better than the ten to twenty teaspoons of sugar you're going to get in a real soda, plus all those calories,\u201d said Jacobson. \u201cProbably the best thing is to avoid them both.\u201d\nBut don\u2019t dismiss the little white packet, encourages The Sugar Association.\n\u201cSales of sugar have been steady. Artificials are not eating into the market too much,\u201d said Phillip Hayes of The Sugar Association .\nHayes pointed to a recent Harris poll on artificial sweeteners which showed three in five Americans believe they are somewhat or not at all safe.\nCommon artificial sweeteners have very little name recognition, the poll found, so parents are unaware of what they\u2019re giving their children. For example, according to poll results, acesulfame k, the sweetener that the CSPI thinks should be off the market, is virtually unknown to parents. Only five percent of parents polled identified it correctly.\nThe Sugar Association has petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to follow Canada\u2019s lead and clear up consumer confusion with front-of-package labeling for artificial sweeteners.\nAs for concerns about calories, Hayes explains that a true teaspoon of sugar \u2013 not a heaping one -- has just fifteen calories that are easily burned off in sixteen minutes of sleep.\nPosted Wednesday, Feb 24, 2010 - 10:14 AM EST\n"}, {"score": 1257.2343, "uuid": "f1e84ecb-c560-5cd3-98b0-399ff9d94dd0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-02-21964", "target_hostname": "www.sparkpeople.com", "target_uri": "http://www.sparkpeople.com/resource/nutrition_articles.asp?id=1203", "page_rank": 1.2621805e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "The Truth about &quot;Natural&quot; <em>Sweeteners</em>", "snippet": "Powders, syrups, and liquids with exotic-sounding names catch your eye, each claiming to be tastier, healthier, or more environmentally-friendly <em>than</em> plain old table <em>sugar</em>.

Learn more\nIf you\u2019ve wandered into a natural food store lately, you might have noticed that the selection of sweeteners seems to have multiplied. Powders, syrups, and liquids with exotic-sounding names catch your eye, each claiming to be tastier, healthier, or more environmentally-friendly than plain old table sugar. But are they really any better? Is it worth the extra expense and hassle of deviating from the mainstream to try \u201cnatural\u201d sweeteners? Whether you choose natural, artificial or conventional sweeteners is up to you. This article provides a rundown of the most common types of \u201cnatural\u201d sweeteners you\u2019ll find on the market to help you decide.\nSugarcane Sweeteners\nSugarcane is a tropical grass that has been cultivated by humans for thousands of years. Making what we know as table sugar from sugarcane can range from a relatively simple to a multistep process, and the final result varies depending on the specific steps in the process. Light and dark brown, powdered, and granulated white sugars are all highly refined, while others, like those listed below, are made with fewer steps on the processing chain. Fewer steps benefit the environment, because less processing means less environmental impact. It also means that more of the vitamins and minerals that naturally occur in sugarcane remain in the end product. All of these sugarcane sweeteners can be found in the baking aisle and/or bulk bins of natural foods stores.\nBlackstrap molasses, unlike other sugarcane sweeteners, contains significant amounts of vitamins and minerals. \u201cFirst\u201d molasses is left over when sugarcane juice is boiled, cooled, and removed of its crystals. If this product is boiled again, the result is called second molasses. Blackstrap molasses is made from the third boiling of the sugar syrup and is the most nutritious molasses, containing substantial amounts of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and iron. When buying, consider choosing organic blackstrap molasses, as pesticides are more likely to be concentrated due to the production of molasses. Cooking notes: Blackstrap molasses has a very strong flavor, so it is best to just replace a small portion of sugar with molasses.\nRapadura is the Portuguese name for unrefined dried sugarcane juice. Probably the least refined of all sugarcane products, rapadura is made simply by cooking juice that has been pressed from sugarcane until it is very concentrated, and then drying and granulating it or, traditionally, pouring it into a mold to dry in brick form, which is then shaved. Because the only thing that has been removed from the original sugarcane juice is the water, rapadura contains all of the vitamins and minerals that are normally found in sugarcane juice, namely iron. A German company called Rapunzel is the main company that markets pure, organic rapadura in the U.S. Cooking notes: Rapadura replaces sugar 1:1 and adds a molasses flavor and dark color, so it\u2019s great in baked goods like brownies, coffee and black tea, but it may not be desirable in something like lemonade.\nSucanat stands for sugar-cane-natural, and is very similar to rapadura. It is made by mechanically extracting sugarcane juice, which is then heated and cooled until tiny brown (thanks to the molasses content) crystals form. It contains less sucrose than table sugar (88 percent and 99 percent, respectively). Cooking notes: Sucanat replaces sugar 1:1 and is also an accepted substitute for traditional brown sugar. Use it as you would rapadura (see above).\nTurbinado sugar is often confused with sucanat, but the two are different. After the sugarcane is pressed to extract the juice, the juice is then boiled, cooled, and allowed to crystallize into granules (like sucanat, above). Next, these granules are refined to a light tan color by washing them in a centrifuge to remove impurities and surface molasses. Turbinado is lighter in color and contains less molasses than both rapadura and sucanat. A popular brand-name of turbinado sugar is Sugar in the Raw, which can be found in most natural food stores, and even in single-serve packets at coffee shops. Cooking notes: Replaces sugar 1:1. Turbinado is a great substitute for brown sugar, too.\nEvaporated cane juice is essentially a finer, lighter-colored version of turbinado sugar. Still less refined than table sugar, it also contains some trace nutrients (that regular sugar does not), including vitamin B2. In Europe, it\u2019s known as \u201cunrefined sugar.\u201d Cooking notes: Replaces sugar 1:1. Can be used in a wide variety of foods and recipes without adversely affecting color or flavor.\nNon-Sugarcane Sweeteners\nNatural sweeteners are flooding the market these days. Here\u2019s a rundown of some of the most common ones that are not made from sugarcane.\nAgave nectar is produced from the juice of the core of the agave, a succulent plant native to Mexico. Far from a whole food, agave juice is extracted, filtered, heated and hydrolyzed into agave syrup. Vegans often use agave as a honey substitute, although it\u2019s even sweeter and a little thinner than honey. It contains trace amounts of iron, calcium, potassium and magnesium. Agave nectar syrup is available in the baking aisle at most natural foods stores. The fructose content of agave syrup is much higher than that of high fructose corn syrup , which is of concern since some research has linked high fructose intake to weight gain (especially around the abdominal area), high triglycerides, heart disease and insulin resistance. High fructose corn syrup contains 55% fructose while agave nectar syrup contains 90%. Despite this, it has a low glycemic index because of its low glucose content. Cooking notes: To replace 1 cup of sugar, use 2/3 cup of agave nectar, reduce the quantity of liquids slightly, and reduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees\u00a0Fahrenheit. It also makes a good sweetener in cold liquids, such as iced tea.\nBrown rice syrup is made when cooked rice is cultured with enzymes, which break down the starch in the rice. The resulting liquid is cooked down to a thick syrup, which is about half as sweet as white sugar and has a mild butterscotch flavor. It is composed of about 50% complex carbohydrates, which break down more slowly in the bloodstream than simple carbohydrates, resulting in a less dramatic spike in blood glucose levels. It\u2019s worth noting that the name \u201cbrown rice syrup\u201d describes the color of the syrup, not the rice it\u2019s made from, which is white. Cooking notes: To replace one cup of sugar, use 1-1/3 cups brown rice syrup, and for each cup of rice syrup added, reduce liquid by 1/4 cup and add 1/4 teaspoon baking soda. Brown rice syrup has the tendency to make food harder and crispier, so it\u2019s great in crisps, granolas, and cookies. You may want to combine it with another sweetener for cakes and sweet breads.\nHoney , made by bees from the nectar of flowers, is a ready-made sweetener that contains traces of nutrients. Cooking notes: To replace 1 cup sugar in baked goods, use about 3/4 cup of honey and lower the oven temperature 25 degrees\u00a0Fahrenheit and reduce liquids by about 2 Tablespoons for each cup of honey.\nMaple syrup comes from the sap of maple trees, which is collected, filtered, and boiled down to an extremely sweet syrup with a distinctive flavor. It contains fewer calories and a higher concentration of minerals (like manganese and zinc) than honey. You can find it in bulk in some natural foods stores, but don\u2019t be fooled by fake maple syrups, which are cheaper and more readily available at the grocery store. \"Maple-flavored syrups\" are imitations of real maple syrup. To easily tell the difference, read the ingredients list on the nutrition label. True maple syrup contains nothing but \u201cmaple syrup.\u201d Imitation syrups are primarily made of high fructose corn syrup, sugar, and/or artificial sweeteners, and contain 3 percent maple syrup (or less). Cooking notes: To replace 1 cup sugar in baking, use about 3/4 cup of maple syrup and lower the oven temperature 25 degrees Fahrenheit. For each cup of maple syrup, reduce liquids by about 2 tablespoons.\nHere\u2019s a chart of how these sweeteners compare with one another and with regular table sugar:\nSweetener\n"}, {"score": 1249.1178, "uuid": "58b8f98c-883e-5468-b776-20d0137e01ea", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0714wb-78-09738", "target_hostname": "www.twobluelemons.com", "target_uri": "http://www.twobluelemons.com/2011/09/ask-sarah-sweeteners.html", "page_rank": 1.3167913e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Two Blue Lemons: Ask Sarah: <em>Sweeteners</em>", "snippet": "I think Stevia is a <em>better</em> option <em>than</em> splenda so in general it is a good switch.

Thank you everyone for sending along your creative and thoughtful questions! I can't wait to share them with you.\nQuestion from Amy in NYC: A few months ago I gave up Splenda, mostly prompted by my friend asking me if I'd ever tasted it on it's own because it \"tastes like chemicals.\" So, my question is the following, what is your favorite natural sweetener? Agave nectar? Do tell.\nI love this question because it reflects how totally confusing seemingly simple choices can be. Which reminds me of something...I was recently in line at a coffee shop and the woman in front of me ordered a turbo iced coffee with 6 artificial sweeteners, blueberry flavored syrup, and whipped cream on top. A COFFEE! But maybe she's thinking choosing a particular sweetener is the healthier choice because that's what the commercials tell her? I'd guess there are hundreds of natural and less than natural sweeteners on the market - all promising to be the best for you in their own way.\nAmy, the short answer is that your friend is right. Splenda is horrible for you and should be avoided at all costs (as should all artificial sweeteners including sweet'n'low, equal, nutrasweet etc). So, what to use?\nFor coffee/tea: Try pure cane sugar. It's actually the least processed of granulated sugars and easiest on your body. That said, ideally you wouldn't put sugar in your coffee anymore but a few sprinkles a day really isn't a big deal. Try to test yourself and put a little less and less in each week and see if you can cut it down to just a little cane sugar or none at all. If the coffee shop doesn't have cane sugar then agave is also an okay choice. Stevia looks interesting and it sounds like a good idea although I feel like it's a new product and I don't really trust it yet. Stevia isn't approved by the FDA in the US, Canada, or the European Union because of concerns re: toxicity levels so don't try it until they feed it to the mice for 20 years then tell us the mice died or grew long noses or something gross...oh poor mice!\nFor cooking/baking: If you're cooking/baking my favorite sweetener is maple syrup or other unprocessed, whole and natural foods. Get creative with cooking and incorporate sweet fruits and vegetables - add mashed bananas, dates, dark chocolate, top something with applesauce, make sweet potato muffins! Honey, agave, molasses, and cane sugar are also good substitutions but never cook with artificial sweeteners - your creations will taste like chemicals and your body will become intoxicated.\nSince I don't have much of a sweet tooth I haven't experimented with other fun sounding items like rice syrup, barley malt, and date sugar. Have you?\nSo, moral of the story. Use items that are the least processed as possible. Find pure cane sugar for coffee but try to cut back on sugar in coffee and if cooking/baking use maple syrup, molasses, honey, sweet fruits and vegetables or pure cane sugar.\nSome of my favorite sweet treats using natural sweeteners:\n"}, {"score": 1238.142, "uuid": "ed9374ba-6243-5003-990f-8c93194d2047", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0400wb-47-28209", "target_hostname": "energybulletin.net", "target_uri": "http://energybulletin.net/stories/2011-10-04/producing-sweeteners-locally", "page_rank": 1.1946811e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Producing <em>sweeteners</em> locally | Energy Bulletin", "snippet": "As many <em>artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em> (notably neotame, aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose) <em>are</em> sweeter by volume <em>than</em> <em>sugar</em>, and store reasonably well, they may be easier trade goods <em>than</em> <em>sugar</em> itself.", "explanation": null, "document": "Published Sep 12 2011 by TCLocal , Archived Oct 4 2011\nProducing sweeteners locally\nby Simon St. Laurent\nOne of the most common complaints about the industrial age is its constant and seemingly ever-growing use of sweeteners. Whether it was cheap sugar (and rum) in the early 1800s, saccharin in the early 1900s, or high-fructose corn syrup in the late 20th century, sweeteners have had a bad\u2014but tasty\u2014reputation.\nIn a local context, however, sweeteners are extremely important. Many of the local fruits that contain Vitamin C, for instance, are difficult eating unless sweetened. Aronia Melanocarpa is called \"chokeberry\" for a reason. Black currants are difficult eating off the bush. The more familiar perennial rhubarb also becomes far more enjoyable with sweetening. Even in less extreme cases, sweeteners can certainly add enjoyment to foods otherwise too bitter or too bland to be attractive. Sugar is also very important in preserving food, where it creates a hostile environment for bacteria as well as a delicious treat.\nMany different sweeteners are available today, though they may become more or less important in localization or energy descent situations. Some require industrial facilities and major energy inputs, and a few are dangerous, but many familiar sweeteners will likely remain available into even an uncertain future.\nSugar and Molasses\nSugar cane, a tropical plant, doesn't grow in Central New York. United States sugar producers are in Louisiana and Florida, though sugar refineries have been prominent features of port cities along the coasts. Modern sugar production relies on energy-intensive industrial processing and distribution. Cane sugar's long history, however, suggests that it and its by-product molasses can still be valuable with reduced processing, as extracting sugar is relatively simple and can be fueled with the cane that created it[1]. Sugar distribution and storage are similarly simple, as it is easily packed for safe storage.\nSugar produced from beets has many of the same issues as cane sugar, but unlike sugar cane, sugar beets can be grown in New York State. However, the quantity of sugar beets currently grown is small enough that the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service[2] doesn't even offer sugar beets as a query option for New York. Today, sugar beets receive more industrial processing than does sugar cane, despite containing 17% sugar while cane contains 10%. Unlike cane, beets cannot easily be processed using their byproducts for fuel. (The byproducts are typically used as animal feed.) Sugar beets are also typically used as a crop in rotation, so the yield per acre is substantially lower than that of cane.[3] Sugar beets can be processed at home on a small scale by chopping, boiling, and evaporating, however.[4]\nFigure 1. Sugar beet field, Sweden ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from Dag Endresen.)\nThe primary questions about sugar in an energy descent situation revolve around price, distribution, and quality.\nThough sugar in the United States is expensive relative to sugar in the rest of the world (roughly double the Canadian price because of American import quotas[5]) it remains a remarkably cheap commodity by historical measures. As the energy costs of sugar refining climb, those prices will likely climb. Diversion of sugarcane to ethanol production may also shrink the available supply of sugar substantially, also increasing the price.\nIf energy costs climb, the cost of distributing sugar, especially cane sugar coming from a distance, will climb. Sugar works well with slower and less energy-demanding forms of transport, but transitions to new distribution patterns may take time. Disruptions may also be more difficult because of the longer supply chain of cane sugar.\nWhile less-refined sugar has become a high-end product recently, most people still expect their sugar to be a pure white with a relatively neutral taste and predictable cooking behavior. If the extra energy cost of refining to white sugar climbs, more people may need to get used to less-refined sugar.\nIt may be possible to create a substantial sugar beet industry in New York State\u2014or it may make sense to count on sugar's relatively easy tradability to keep it available.\nCorn sweeteners\nCorn-based sweeteners thrive today because of a combination of the import quotas noted above and subsidies for corn production. Dent corn is converted into corn starch by a wet millling process and then treated with enzymes to produce corn (glucose) syrup. High-Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) is made by an additional enzyme process to convert much of that glucose to fructose.[6] This is a strictly industrial energy intensive process:\nCorn wet milling is the most energy intensive industry within the food and kindred products group, using 15% of the energy in the entire food industry. After corn, energy is the second largest operating cost for corn wet millers in the United States. A typical corn wet milling plant in the United States spends approximately $20 to $30 million per year on energy.[7, page 3]\nFigure 2. Wet corn mill ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from Jim Hammer.)\nWhile dent corn can be grown locally, the industrial scale and energy requirements of wet corn milling seem to put local corn syrup out of reach. There was a corn wet mill in Montezuma, New York, just up Cayuga Lake, but it closed in 1986.[7, page 73] Like sugar, corn syrup can be easily transported and stored.\nArtificial sweeteners\nIf you count the extremely toxic \"Sugar of Lead\" (lead acetate), artificial sweeteners have been around for thousands of years, though the modern history usually begins with saccharin in 1879. While it is likely possible to create most of these sweeteners in the laboratory facilities available at Cornell, most of them are produced today in large volume at chemical plants.\nAs many artificial sweeteners (notably neotame, aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose) are sweeter by volume than sugar, and store reasonably well, they may be easier trade goods than sugar itself. Xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, the sweet alcohols, are roughly as sweet as sugar and are useful both to sweeten food for diabetics and potentially as a tooth decay preventative.\nLead acetate deserves special attention as a danger, as it is not difficult to synthesize from lead and has commonly been used as an adulterant in foods and drinks.\nHoney\nHoney is a commonly available sweetener that can be produced in large quantities in the Finger Lakes region. Beekeepers encourage hives to produce more honey than they need to survive the winter, then take the extra honey for human consumption.\nBeekeeping is a complex art, though it scales down to the household level more easily than the production of many other sweeteners. Keeping hives alive has become more difficult in recent years with the spread of pests, notably varroa mites, but the infrastructure and learning investments required to become a successful beekeeper are still fairly small.\nUntil the mid-19th century, beekeepers used hollow logs or straw houses, called skeps, for their bees. While these worked, they didn't allow beekeepers to inspect the hive for disease, and the hive usually had to be destroyed to retrieve the honey. Because of disease issues, skeps are illegal in the US.\nMost beekeepers use Langstroth hives, rectangular boxes filled with frames in which the bees make their home. So long as beekeepers maintain precise distances between equipment inside of the hive, the bees will avoid gluing everything together. This flexibility makes it simpler for beekeepers to inspect the hive, as well as to add and remove equipment to gather honey. Langstroth equipment does require a fairly substantial investment, and most beekeepers buy sturdy frames filled with wax or plastic foundation printed in a hex pattern. This gives bees a bit of a head start, and reinforcements in that foundation make it much easier to extract honey by spinning the frames mechanically.\nFigure 3. Bees on framed comb, honey top right, brood lower left. (Photo Simon St.Laurent.)\nIt is possible, though slow, to replace frames with bars with a simpler strip of wax on the bottom and have the bees build their comb on that, but the frames will be less regular and more difficult to use with an extractor. Taking that idea further, some beekeepers are using top bar hives. These hives fit into a single box organized horizontally rather than stacked vertically. The bees build their own comb, and beekeepers who want to collect the honey press or cut the comb instead of spinning it. This destroys the comb, requiring the bees to work harder to make new honey, but requires less dedicated equipment.\nWhile much beekeeping equipment can be built from readily available wood and metal, two pieces of the beekeeping system are more difficult. The foundation is generally manufactured, though it can be created on a smaller scale using old equipment like some of that on display in the Dyce Lab at Cornell. The harder challenge is the supply of bees and queens. New bees and queens can be raised in the north, but at present most nurseries for bees are considerably farther south and rely on express delivery services. Local breeding has become more popular as a way to improve bees, so this may not remain an issue for very long.\nBeekeepers are facing an ever-wider variety of diseases and parasites. While Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) made headlines, most beekeepers are battling a variety of problems, most notably varroa mites. Chemical solutions can keep mites at bay, but mites seem likely to be a permanent feature of beekeeping at this point. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) mixes chemical and other approaches, focusing on keeping hives going. Inspection, now an optional event in New York State, may become especially important again if beekeepers have to rely on their own production of bees rather than importing new ones from the south.\nWhile some beekeepers might find warmer weather convenient, changing weather patterns, especially if extreme weather becomes more common, could create difficulties. Rain and snow can keep bees in their hives and prevent their collecting food, while drought can delay or hinder plants from flowering. Bees also fly much less when temperatures are 90\u00b0 F or higher, staying home to cool the hive. Bears moving north present another challenge.\nMaple Syrup and Maple Sugar\nUpstate New York has been producing maple syrup and maple sugar for centuries. Native Americans taught European settlers about collecting and concentrating sap, and Europeans gradually technologized and standardized the process. It was a key part of the development plan for early Cooperstown, though visions of maple fortunes faded quickly[8], and the energy and infrastructure challenges of making maple syrup have kept it from competing with cane or beet sugar. (Beet syrup starts at a concentration of 6 parts water to 1 part sugar, cane syrup starts at 10:1, and maple sap is at 40:1.)\nWhile many modern maple syrup producers use plastic tubing to collect the sap, simple metal taps and buckets can provide a sustainable (if labor-intensive) collection system. Even a simple pot can work for boiling down sap, though large flat pans and especially more complex flue pans make it much easier to evaporate sap down to syrup. An indoor wood stove already used for heat can boil syrup at the household level, while a sugarhouse with vents is likely a better idea for a larger pan. A sugarhouse will need a dedicated supply of wood (or other fuel), but that is frequently available in the same areas as maple stands.[9]\nWhile sugar maples (Acer saccharum) are the traditional tree for maple syrup production, red, black, and some silver maples can also be tapped, as can box elders and birches.\nAt any scale, however, maple faces some challenges. The flow of sap depends on the weather, particularly on the contrast between daytime and night time temperatures. Sap flows during the day, carrying sugar from the roots. A winter that turns too suddenly into spring can disrupt maple production, as can seasonal storms that make it difficult to collect and evaporate syrup. The short season and its unreliability make maple syrup a risky product. While it is not difficult to preserve maple syrup, its greater water content makes it more likely to spoil than honey or sugar. (Maple syrup can be made into maple sugar, at a large energy cost in additional refining.)\nFigure 4. Evaporating syrup in Marathon, NY (photo Simon St.Laurent)\nMaples also face environmental challenges. Climate change may shift the range northward, giving hickories and oaks an advantage while limiting maples. Long-term changes in spring weather patterns could also complicate or reduce the maple season further. The Asian Long-Horned Beetle, already present in New York City, attacks and weakens maple trees and a variety of other species. Larvae tunnel through the wood, weakening the tree.[10] These beetles may reduce the number of healthy maples and make it more difficult for new maples to survive.\nSorghum\nSweet sorghum, though traditionally grown further south, can produce a syrup similar to molasses, as well as silage or forage for animals. Some farmers are experimenting with it in Tompkins County as a cover crop and animal feed today, and it may be an appealing option if climate change extends the growing season.\nProcessing sorghum for syrup requires stripping the leaves and seed head off the cane, then squeezing the juice out of it and evaporating and skimming that juice. Crushing the cane is generally done with a simple mill, and the resulting juice yields about a gallon of syrup from ten gallons of juice.[11]\nFigure 5. Sorghum mill ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from g-s-h.)\nFruit Juices\nFruit juices and concentrates, and even applesauce, are classic sweeteners. While whole fruits are, of course, a delicious way to enjoy fruits, juicing and similar processes make it much easier for people to consume fruits that are bruised, damaged, or simply useful as a background sweetener rather than as the primary flavor. Commonly available apple and grape juices, both products of Upstate New York, are regularly used to provide bulk and sweetness to more expensive juices like cranberries, blackberries, blueberries, or (more recently) pomegranate.\nLike fruits, fruit juices can be canned or frozen. They require more energy input to preserve than do sugar or honey, but are easier to create with ordinary pots or pans or with simple tools like steam juicers. They scale up to greater volumes easily as well.\nMalt\nGrains are another common source of sweetness. Malting grain is a fairly complex process involving drying, storing, adding water, partially germinating, and then processing and often mashing. Today most malting relies on industrial equipment and purpose-built malting floors, but the basic steps can be done with simple equipment on a wide variety of scales.\nFigure 6. Malting floor ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from Chris Sharp)\nMalt is most commonly used as a fermentation base for beer and whiskey, but it is also a key component in malted milks, malt vinegar, and malt candies. Barley is the most common grain used for malting. Many grains are bred specifically to provide the enzymes needed for the malting process.\nStevia\nStevia is a relative newcomer, at least in the United States. The plant Stevia rebaudiana, originally from South America, has leaves that are approximately 30 times sweeter than sugar, and its core sweetening compounds are approximately 250 times sweeter. The Food and Drug Adminstration has allowed the sale of stevia as a food supplement but not as an ingredient, though stevia-derived sweeteners are now legal for use.\nFigure 7. Stevia plant. ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from Irene Kightley)\nStevia's climate expectations limit its use for large-scale plantings in Tompkins County. However, it may prove useful as a household-scale sweetener, especially for people who have difficulties with other sweeteners. It can grow as a window plant, getting the sun that it needs while avoiding the cold. Stevia leaves can be used directly as a sweetener without further processing.\nAlcohol\nAll of the natural sweeteners except stevia can be converted into alcohol through fermentation, possibly followed by more energy-intensive distillation. Malt is traditionally used for beer; fruit juices for wine; hard cider, and brandies, honey for mead; and sugar and molasses for rum. In addition to its intoxicating qualities, alcohol can be used as a preservative and to sterilize medical equipment and wounds.\nIn an energy descent situation, however, sugars are perhaps dangerously attractive as an easy source of alcohol for fuel. Competition between food and energy uses of sugar will likely increase demand (and prices) for sweeteners.\nPolicy Suggestions\nSome projects supporting local sweetener production already exist. Cornell's Master Beekeeper program and its work with maple products in the Arnot Teaching and Research Forest focus on honey and maple syrup. Cornell Cooperative Education offers sessions on fruit juices and preserving.\nSome sweeteners, notably cane sugar and corn syrup, are unlikely ever to become local products, and most of the artificial sweeteners are unlikely to become economical local products.\nSorghum and stevia originated in far warmer climates than Tompkins County has to offer, but both are worth exploring in different contexts. For now, sorghum seems useful primarily as a cover crop, with some potential for use as a sweetener. Stevia is more promising because of its ability to grow as a houseplant, and could be an excellent target for Cooperative Extension projects and local nursery development.\nThere is one great danger here, something that local public health officials should watch for: the possible return of lead acetate. At present, this threat is discussed mostly in the context of imported food, but it could just as easily surface in local food. Watching for symptoms and developing testing protocols could become much more important if the price of sweeteners climbs.\n"}, {"score": 1237.9359, "uuid": "405fe773-342f-53c0-8669-4fd0ce4b6845", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1217wb-47-25390", "target_hostname": "www.100daysofrealfood.com", "target_uri": "http://www.100daysofrealfood.com/2010/06/14/sweeteners-101/comment-page-1/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>Sweeteners</em> 101 \u00ab 100 Days of Real Food", "snippet": "All of these (as well as other <em>sweeteners</em>) <em>are</em> high in energy and low in nutrients, although an alternative like honey or maple syrup might be slightly <em>better</em> in the nutrition department.

Sugar-sweetened beverages may raise the risk of heart disease in women, according to recently published results of a large-scale prospective study. Two or more servings of sugar-sweetened beverages per day increased women\u2019s risk of heart disease by 35% (p < 0.001) compared with those who drank less than one serving per month, even after accounting for unhealthy lifestyle and dietary factors.1\nCalorie-free sweeteners, also known as nonnutritive sweeteners, were not associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. The researchers pointed out that sugar-free drinks benefit from their lack of fructose, a sugar that has been linked to increased triacylglycerol concentrations, a known risk factor for CHD.1 Reducing the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, which are often discretionary calories from soda and juice, may also help with overweight, another known risk factor for CHD.\nAs nutrition experts, we know the evidence overwhelmingly supports reducing the intake of added sugars. While calorie-free sweeteners may help satisfy the American sweet tooth (without the extra calories or possible increased risk of CHD that comes with sugar), clients may be confused by negative headlines. Be ready for the questions on sweeteners and health from your clients and patients.\nQ: Are added sugars really that unhealthy for me?\nExperts agree on this one, and the answer is yes, in significant quantities. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends \u201cfoods and beverages with little added sugars or caloric sweeteners.\u201d The American Dietetic Association\u2019s (ADA) Evidence Analysis Library reviewed the literature and supports this recommendation. The ADA position statement indicates that a person\u2019s diet quality suffers when nutritive sweeteners contribute more than 25% of total energy intake.2\nAnd many RDs agree. \u201cConsuming less sugar has a lot of benefits. Helping stave off women\u2019s No. 1 killer is a big one,\u201d says Maggie Moon, MS, RD. \u201cSugary drinks are a major source of added sugars, and cutting back can only help.\u201d\nPamela M. Nisevich, MS, RD, CSSD, LD, a specialist in sports dietetics, sees the role sugar-sweetened beverages play in overweight and obesity. \u201cFrom calorie-rich coffee drinks to syrupy energy drinks to so-called fruit juices, I see countless patients who could easily whittle their waistlines and reduce their [weight-related] risk of chronic diseases by simply choosing reduced-calorie or sugar-free drinks instead.\u201d\nQ: What did the study say about disease risk and sugar-sweetened beverages?\nThe 2009 study appeared in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The authors knew that previous research found associations between sugar-sweetened beverages and weight gain, as well as an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. They decided to look at sugar-sweetened beverage intake and the risk of CHD in women.1\nThe study followed 88,520 women aged 34 to 59 from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study from 1980 to 2004 to see how sugar-sweetened beverage intake affected CHD risk. At the start of the study, the women did not have CHD, stroke, or diabetes. After 24 years and seven food frequency questionnaires, researchers found 3,105 new cases of CHD. Having one serving of sugar-sweetened beverage per day translated into a 23% increased risk; two or more per day equaled the 35% increased risk noted previously. The researchers adjusted for body mass index, energy intake, and new cases of diabetes. Drinks sweetened with nonnutritive sweeteners were not associated with CHD.1\nQ: Are nonnutritive sweeteners safe?\nMany nonnutritive sweeteners have been more thoroughly researched than some drugs or food additives currently on the market. In total, there have been more than 200 toxicological and clinical studies conducted over 30 years on aspartame alone. The ADA Evidence Analysis Library reviewed the evidence on the safety and effects of this common nonnutritive sweetener and concluded that consuming aspartame is \u201cnot associated with adverse effects in the general population.\u201d2\nThe report further states, \u201cStudies have found no evidence of an effect of aspartame on a wide range of adverse effects, including hypersensitivity reactions, elevated blood methanol or formate levels, hematopoeitic or brain cancers. Neurological changes tested included cognitive functions, seizures, headaches and changes in memory or mood.\u201d2 The data from peer-reviewed journals suggest the same safety rating is true of other FDA-approved nonnutritive sweeteners.\nThe ADA adds that scientists have evaluated these sweeteners for many attributes, including sensory qualities (eg, clean, sweet taste; no bitterness; odorless), safety, effect on appetite (no effect), compatibility with other food ingredients, and stability in different food environments.2\nQ: Will nonnutritive sweeteners make me fat?\nThis common misinterpretation of a clinical study out of the psychology department at Purdue University warrants a closer look. The animal study compared a saccharin-sweetened diet to a glucose-sweetened one. Since straight glucose is not very palatable, the rats consumed more of the saccharine-sweetened foods. Therefore, overall calorie intake was higher in the saccharin group. Simply put, they ate more, and that\u2019s why they gained weight.3\nQ: Are nonnutritive sweeteners healthy?\nThe ADA suggests that calorie-free sweeteners may assist in weight management, blood glucose control, and preventing cavities. Essentially, when replacing calorie-rich beverages and foods with low-calorie alternatives, research suggests that patients and consumers stand to benefit from lower overall energy intake and better blood glucose control, reduced risk of heart disease, and more.\nAs another strategy, if adding nonnutritive sweeteners to nutrient-dense food choices such as fruit will help improve palatability for some, it has the potential to boost overall diet quality by increasing fruit intake.\nQ: Which ones are FDA approved?\nNonnutritive sweeteners on the market must be approved as safe by the FDA, which regulates artificial sweeteners as food additives. See the accompanying table for an overview of five common nonnutritive sweeteners, including the zero-calorie sweeteners made from the stevia plant that were added to the safe list in 2008. To date, the approved nonnutritive sweeteners are acesulfame potassium/acesulfame-K, aspartame, neotame, saccharin, sucralose, and stevia.4\nQ: Should I believe everything I read online about nonnutritive sweeteners?\nWhile the Internet is a wonderful educational tool, consumers may have trouble sorting out what\u2019s credible from convincing but nonetheless anecdotal evidence. Steer clients toward Web sites run by trustworthy organizations, such as the ADA or the American Heart Association. The Harvard School of Public Health provides guidance on choosing healthy drinks at www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks.\nQ: Why should I believe you?\nRemind clients that RDs and other health professionals are trained to focus on credible, evidence-based research. Encourage them to ask RDs questions about sweeteners and safety issues.\nThe ADA backs us up on this one: \u201cIt is the position of the American Dietetic Association that consumers can safely enjoy a range of nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners when consumed in a diet that is guided by current federal nutrition recommendations, such as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Dietary Reference Intakes, as well as individual health goals. Dietetics professionals should provide consumers with science-based information about sweeteners and support research on the use of sweeteners to promote eating enjoyment, optimal nutrition, and health.\u201d2\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Jenna A.

Even an infant knows the vast difference between a drop of sugar and spinach. But pure sugar is rare in nature. While it used to be an expensive commodity, these days sugar and it vast array of substitutes are cheap. We have become accustomed to consuming a lot more than we actually need. Most of it is in the form of refined sugars or high-fructose corn syrup that can create a vicious cycle of spikes and troughs in the body\u2019s blood glucose levels.\u00a0 This can lead to hyperactivity.\u00a0 Excess sweeteners have also been linked to other medical problems, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.\nAt CFYL, we recommend using all sugars sparingly, whether refined white or organic brown. The more minimally refined varieties of sugar are a slightly lesser evil. Turbinado and raw sugars are the extracted, evaporated, and crystalized juice of the sugar cane plant\u2014a natural and thereby slightly less naughty source of sweetness. White sugar is so refined that it\u2019s 100% sucrose, lacking the trace nutrients that less refined sugars still have. You can also use honey, maple syrup, molasses, or agave, to sweeten food and treats, all of which have trace vitamins and minerals.\nEven when we try to use sugar in moderation, it\u2019s easy for it to slip into our diets unnoticed. Sugar and other sweeteners have an overwhelming presence in all kinds of packaged foods from cookies to frozen peas and ketchup. In many products, sugar has been replaced by highly processed high-fructose corn syrup, which is twice as sweet as sugar and can be difficult for the body to break down. We recommend always reading food labels and ingredient lists to determine how much hidden sugar may be in your food, and what the source of the sweetness really is.\nSo what about all those zero calorie artificial sweeteners? According to the American Cancer Society and The National Cancer Institute, there is no conclusive evidence that common sweeteners on the market today including aspartame (Equal), sucralose (Splenda), saccharin, and acesulfame potassium cause cancer, but they may have other negative effects. When your tongue tastes something sweet, it sends a signal to your brain, alerting it of a carbohydrate load coming its way. When these carbs never show up, our bodies may just be left wanting more. Not a good reaction for those of us watching our waistline and heart health. So what\u2019s CFYL\u2019s advice? Use\u00a0the real thing; just limit your use, and cut down on sugary treats. If you\u2019re diabetic, artificial sweeteners might be the way to go, but talk to your registered dietician\u00a0about your options.People have been eating natural forms of sugar since time immemorial. Artificial sweeteners are only a recent development, and we have no way of knowing what kinds of long-term effects they have on our bodies.\nAnn's Tips\nBuy organic brown cane sugar, such as Florida Crystals, or turbinado sugar for daily use instead of the more refined white sugars. However, sugar is sugar; use it in small quantities. Bear in mind that for optimum health, all sugary sweets and desserts should be an occasional treat and not an everyday habit.\nRecipe Tips\nAlways go easy with sugar when you cook. Cut down on it wherever you can, especially when you make desserts or bake cookies and cakes. For starters, try making tarts and pies with unsweetened crusts, as in our Apple Pie . The savory short-crust pastry deliciously enhances the natural sweetness of the apples. Many traditional cake recipes don\u2019t need all the sugar they call for to come out well. In our rich Marble Pound Cake, for instance, you\u2019ll find a little goes a long way.\n"}, {"score": 1217.9114, "uuid": "ea627cf5-02ab-56ed-b431-a8c3118f219c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1019wb-52-23649", "target_hostname": "ebnew.postcarbon.org", "target_uri": "http://ebnew.postcarbon.org/stories/2011-10-04/producing-sweeteners-locally", "page_rank": 1.1719838e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "Producing <em>sweeteners</em> locally | Energy Bulletin", "snippet": "As many <em>artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em> (notably neotame, aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose) <em>are</em> sweeter by volume <em>than</em> <em>sugar</em>, and store reasonably well, they may be easier trade goods <em>than</em> <em>sugar</em> itself.", "explanation": null, "document": "Changes coming to Energy Bulletin soon... Find out more...\n1173 reads\nPublished Sep 12 2011 by TCLocal , Archived Oct 4 2011\nProducing sweeteners locally\nby Simon St. Laurent\nOne of the most common complaints about the industrial age is its constant and seemingly ever-growing use of sweeteners. Whether it was cheap sugar (and rum) in the early 1800s, saccharin in the early 1900s, or high-fructose corn syrup in the late 20th century, sweeteners have had a bad\u2014but tasty\u2014reputation.\nIn a local context, however, sweeteners are extremely important. Many of the local fruits that contain Vitamin C, for instance, are difficult eating unless sweetened. Aronia Melanocarpa is called \"chokeberry\" for a reason. Black currants are difficult eating off the bush. The more familiar perennial rhubarb also becomes far more enjoyable with sweetening. Even in less extreme cases, sweeteners can certainly add enjoyment to foods otherwise too bitter or too bland to be attractive. Sugar is also very important in preserving food, where it creates a hostile environment for bacteria as well as a delicious treat.\nMany different sweeteners are available today, though they may become more or less important in localization or energy descent situations. Some require industrial facilities and major energy inputs, and a few are dangerous, but many familiar sweeteners will likely remain available into even an uncertain future.\nSugar and Molasses\nSugar cane, a tropical plant, doesn't grow in Central New York. United States sugar producers are in Louisiana and Florida, though sugar refineries have been prominent features of port cities along the coasts. Modern sugar production relies on energy-intensive industrial processing and distribution. Cane sugar's long history, however, suggests that it and its by-product molasses can still be valuable with reduced processing, as extracting sugar is relatively simple and can be fueled with the cane that created it[1]. Sugar distribution and storage are similarly simple, as it is easily packed for safe storage.\nSugar produced from beets has many of the same issues as cane sugar, but unlike sugar cane, sugar beets can be grown in New York State. However, the quantity of sugar beets currently grown is small enough that the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service[2] doesn't even offer sugar beets as a query option for New York. Today, sugar beets receive more industrial processing than does sugar cane, despite containing 17% sugar while cane contains 10%. Unlike cane, beets cannot easily be processed using their byproducts for fuel. (The byproducts are typically used as animal feed.) Sugar beets are also typically used as a crop in rotation, so the yield per acre is substantially lower than that of cane.[3] Sugar beets can be processed at home on a small scale by chopping, boiling, and evaporating, however.[4]\nFigure 1. Sugar beet field, Sweden ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from Dag Endresen.)\nThe primary questions about sugar in an energy descent situation revolve around price, distribution, and quality.\nThough sugar in the United States is expensive relative to sugar in the rest of the world (roughly double the Canadian price because of American import quotas[5]) it remains a remarkably cheap commodity by historical measures. As the energy costs of sugar refining climb, those prices will likely climb. Diversion of sugarcane to ethanol production may also shrink the available supply of sugar substantially, also increasing the price.\nIf energy costs climb, the cost of distributing sugar, especially cane sugar coming from a distance, will climb. Sugar works well with slower and less energy-demanding forms of transport, but transitions to new distribution patterns may take time. Disruptions may also be more difficult because of the longer supply chain of cane sugar.\nWhile less-refined sugar has become a high-end product recently, most people still expect their sugar to be a pure white with a relatively neutral taste and predictable cooking behavior. If the extra energy cost of refining to white sugar climbs, more people may need to get used to less-refined sugar.\nIt may be possible to create a substantial sugar beet industry in New York State\u2014or it may make sense to count on sugar's relatively easy tradability to keep it available.\nCorn sweeteners\nCorn-based sweeteners thrive today because of a combination of the import quotas noted above and subsidies for corn production. Dent corn is converted into corn starch by a wet millling process and then treated with enzymes to produce corn (glucose) syrup. High-Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) is made by an additional enzyme process to convert much of that glucose to fructose.[6] This is a strictly industrial energy intensive process:\nCorn wet milling is the most energy intensive industry within the food and kindred products group, using 15% of the energy in the entire food industry. After corn, energy is the second largest operating cost for corn wet millers in the United States. A typical corn wet milling plant in the United States spends approximately $20 to $30 million per year on energy.[7, page 3]\nFigure 2. Wet corn mill ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from Jim Hammer.)\nWhile dent corn can be grown locally, the industrial scale and energy requirements of wet corn milling seem to put local corn syrup out of reach. There was a corn wet mill in Montezuma, New York, just up Cayuga Lake, but it closed in 1986.[7, page 73] Like sugar, corn syrup can be easily transported and stored.\nArtificial sweeteners\nIf you count the extremely toxic \"Sugar of Lead\" (lead acetate), artificial sweeteners have been around for thousands of years, though the modern history usually begins with saccharin in 1879. While it is likely possible to create most of these sweeteners in the laboratory facilities available at Cornell, most of them are produced today in large volume at chemical plants.\nAs many artificial sweeteners (notably neotame, aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose) are sweeter by volume than sugar, and store reasonably well, they may be easier trade goods than sugar itself. Xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, the sweet alcohols, are roughly as sweet as sugar and are useful both to sweeten food for diabetics and potentially as a tooth decay preventative.\nLead acetate deserves special attention as a danger, as it is not difficult to synthesize from lead and has commonly been used as an adulterant in foods and drinks.\nHoney\nHoney is a commonly available sweetener that can be produced in large quantities in the Finger Lakes region. Beekeepers encourage hives to produce more honey than they need to survive the winter, then take the extra honey for human consumption.\nBeekeeping is a complex art, though it scales down to the household level more easily than the production of many other sweeteners. Keeping hives alive has become more difficult in recent years with the spread of pests, notably varroa mites, but the infrastructure and learning investments required to become a successful beekeeper are still fairly small.\nUntil the mid-19th century, beekeepers used hollow logs or straw houses, called skeps, for their bees. While these worked, they didn't allow beekeepers to inspect the hive for disease, and the hive usually had to be destroyed to retrieve the honey. Because of disease issues, skeps are illegal in the US.\nMost beekeepers use Langstroth hives, rectangular boxes filled with frames in which the bees make their home. So long as beekeepers maintain precise distances between equipment inside of the hive, the bees will avoid gluing everything together. This flexibility makes it simpler for beekeepers to inspect the hive, as well as to add and remove equipment to gather honey. Langstroth equipment does require a fairly substantial investment, and most beekeepers buy sturdy frames filled with wax or plastic foundation printed in a hex pattern. This gives bees a bit of a head start, and reinforcements in that foundation make it much easier to extract honey by spinning the frames mechanically.\nFigure 3. Bees on framed comb, honey top right, brood lower left. (Photo Simon St.Laurent.)\nIt is possible, though slow, to replace frames with bars with a simpler strip of wax on the bottom and have the bees build their comb on that, but the frames will be less regular and more difficult to use with an extractor. Taking that idea further, some beekeepers are using top bar hives. These hives fit into a single box organized horizontally rather than stacked vertically. The bees build their own comb, and beekeepers who want to collect the honey press or cut the comb instead of spinning it. This destroys the comb, requiring the bees to work harder to make new honey, but requires less dedicated equipment.\nWhile much beekeeping equipment can be built from readily available wood and metal, two pieces of the beekeeping system are more difficult. The foundation is generally manufactured, though it can be created on a smaller scale using old equipment like some of that on display in the Dyce Lab at Cornell. The harder challenge is the supply of bees and queens. New bees and queens can be raised in the north, but at present most nurseries for bees are considerably farther south and rely on express delivery services. Local breeding has become more popular as a way to improve bees, so this may not remain an issue for very long.\nBeekeepers are facing an ever-wider variety of diseases and parasites. While Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) made headlines, most beekeepers are battling a variety of problems, most notably varroa mites. Chemical solutions can keep mites at bay, but mites seem likely to be a permanent feature of beekeeping at this point. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) mixes chemical and other approaches, focusing on keeping hives going. Inspection, now an optional event in New York State, may become especially important again if beekeepers have to rely on their own production of bees rather than importing new ones from the south.\nWhile some beekeepers might find warmer weather convenient, changing weather patterns, especially if extreme weather becomes more common, could create difficulties. Rain and snow can keep bees in their hives and prevent their collecting food, while drought can delay or hinder plants from flowering. Bees also fly much less when temperatures are 90\u00b0 F or higher, staying home to cool the hive. Bears moving north present another challenge.\nMaple Syrup and Maple Sugar\nUpstate New York has been producing maple syrup and maple sugar for centuries. Native Americans taught European settlers about collecting and concentrating sap, and Europeans gradually technologized and standardized the process. It was a key part of the development plan for early Cooperstown, though visions of maple fortunes faded quickly[8], and the energy and infrastructure challenges of making maple syrup have kept it from competing with cane or beet sugar. (Beet syrup starts at a concentration of 6 parts water to 1 part sugar, cane syrup starts at 10:1, and maple sap is at 40:1.)\nWhile many modern maple syrup producers use plastic tubing to collect the sap, simple metal taps and buckets can provide a sustainable (if labor-intensive) collection system. Even a simple pot can work for boiling down sap, though large flat pans and especially more complex flue pans make it much easier to evaporate sap down to syrup. An indoor wood stove already used for heat can boil syrup at the household level, while a sugarhouse with vents is likely a better idea for a larger pan. A sugarhouse will need a dedicated supply of wood (or other fuel), but that is frequently available in the same areas as maple stands.[9]\nWhile sugar maples (Acer saccharum) are the traditional tree for maple syrup production, red, black, and some silver maples can also be tapped, as can box elders and birches.\nAt any scale, however, maple faces some challenges. The flow of sap depends on the weather, particularly on the contrast between daytime and night time temperatures. Sap flows during the day, carrying sugar from the roots. A winter that turns too suddenly into spring can disrupt maple production, as can seasonal storms that make it difficult to collect and evaporate syrup. The short season and its unreliability make maple syrup a risky product. While it is not difficult to preserve maple syrup, its greater water content makes it more likely to spoil than honey or sugar. (Maple syrup can be made into maple sugar, at a large energy cost in additional refining.)\nFigure 4. Evaporating syrup in Marathon, NY (photo Simon St.Laurent)\nMaples also face environmental challenges. Climate change may shift the range northward, giving hickories and oaks an advantage while limiting maples. Long-term changes in spring weather patterns could also complicate or reduce the maple season further. The Asian Long-Horned Beetle, already present in New York City, attacks and weakens maple trees and a variety of other species. Larvae tunnel through the wood, weakening the tree.[10] These beetles may reduce the number of healthy maples and make it more difficult for new maples to survive.\nSorghum\nSweet sorghum, though traditionally grown further south, can produce a syrup similar to molasses, as well as silage or forage for animals. Some farmers are experimenting with it in Tompkins County as a cover crop and animal feed today, and it may be an appealing option if climate change extends the growing season.\nProcessing sorghum for syrup requires stripping the leaves and seed head off the cane, then squeezing the juice out of it and evaporating and skimming that juice. Crushing the cane is generally done with a simple mill, and the resulting juice yields about a gallon of syrup from ten gallons of juice.[11]\nFigure 5. Sorghum mill ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from g-s-h.)\nFruit Juices\nFruit juices and concentrates, and even applesauce, are classic sweeteners. While whole fruits are, of course, a delicious way to enjoy fruits, juicing and similar processes make it much easier for people to consume fruits that are bruised, damaged, or simply useful as a background sweetener rather than as the primary flavor. Commonly available apple and grape juices, both products of Upstate New York, are regularly used to provide bulk and sweetness to more expensive juices like cranberries, blackberries, blueberries, or (more recently) pomegranate.\nLike fruits, fruit juices can be canned or frozen. They require more energy input to preserve than do sugar or honey, but are easier to create with ordinary pots or pans or with simple tools like steam juicers. They scale up to greater volumes easily as well.\nMalt\nGrains are another common source of sweetness. Malting grain is a fairly complex process involving drying, storing, adding water, partially germinating, and then processing and often mashing. Today most malting relies on industrial equipment and purpose-built malting floors, but the basic steps can be done with simple equipment on a wide variety of scales.\nFigure 6. Malting floor ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from Chris Sharp)\nMalt is most commonly used as a fermentation base for beer and whiskey, but it is also a key component in malted milks, malt vinegar, and malt candies. Barley is the most common grain used for malting. Many grains are bred specifically to provide the enzymes needed for the malting process.\nStevia\nStevia is a relative newcomer, at least in the United States. The plant Stevia rebaudiana, originally from South America, has leaves that are approximately 30 times sweeter than sugar, and its core sweetening compounds are approximately 250 times sweeter. The Food and Drug Adminstration has allowed the sale of stevia as a food supplement but not as an ingredient, though stevia-derived sweeteners are now legal for use.\nFigure 7. Stevia plant. ( original source , used under Creative Commons license from Irene Kightley)\nStevia's climate expectations limit its use for large-scale plantings in Tompkins County. However, it may prove useful as a household-scale sweetener, especially for people who have difficulties with other sweeteners. It can grow as a window plant, getting the sun that it needs while avoiding the cold. Stevia leaves can be used directly as a sweetener without further processing.\nAlcohol\nAll of the natural sweeteners except stevia can be converted into alcohol through fermentation, possibly followed by more energy-intensive distillation. Malt is traditionally used for beer; fruit juices for wine; hard cider, and brandies, honey for mead; and sugar and molasses for rum. In addition to its intoxicating qualities, alcohol can be used as a preservative and to sterilize medical equipment and wounds.\nIn an energy descent situation, however, sugars are perhaps dangerously attractive as an easy source of alcohol for fuel. Competition between food and energy uses of sugar will likely increase demand (and prices) for sweeteners.\nPolicy Suggestions\nSome projects supporting local sweetener production already exist. Cornell's Master Beekeeper program and its work with maple products in the Arnot Teaching and Research Forest focus on honey and maple syrup. Cornell Cooperative Education offers sessions on fruit juices and preserving.\nSome sweeteners, notably cane sugar and corn syrup, are unlikely ever to become local products, and most of the artificial sweeteners are unlikely to become economical local products.\nSorghum and stevia originated in far warmer climates than Tompkins County has to offer, but both are worth exploring in different contexts. For now, sorghum seems useful primarily as a cover crop, with some potential for use as a sweetener. Stevia is more promising because of its ability to grow as a houseplant, and could be an excellent target for Cooperative Extension projects and local nursery development.\nThere is one great danger here, something that local public health officials should watch for: the possible return of lead acetate. At present, this threat is discussed mostly in the context of imported food, but it could just as easily surface in local food. Watching for symptoms and developing testing protocols could become much more important if the price of sweeteners climbs.\n"}, {"score": 1209.6877, "uuid": "08473a84-fea0-517c-a02d-437d29d133bf", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-35-10960", "target_hostname": "chicfitchef.com", "target_uri": "http://chicfitchef.com/2012/03/06/gimme-some-sugar-sugar/", "page_rank": 1.3886422e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Gimme Some <em>Sugar</em>, <em>Sugar</em>! | ChicFitChef", "snippet": "The farther away you can get from processed (<em>white</em>) <em>sugar</em> the <em>better</em>!", "explanation": null, "document": "Posted on March 6, 2012 by ChicFitChef\nImage via Wikipedia\nI LOVE Splenda . It\u2019s almost unholy really. I keep some on my kitchen counter right next to my Starbucks coffee grounds and coffeemaker. I keep a Ziplock bag of a few packets in my desk at work. And I even have a few beaten up packets at the bottom of my purse- just in case.\nMy love of Splenda got me thinking about doing some posts on sugars and sweeteners. There\u2019s a whole bunch of stuff out there and I thought it would be helpful to post what these little condiments are and what they do to our bodies. And I hope it will be helpful to everyone & especially helpful to those recently-diagnosed diabetics or caregivers!\u00a0There\u2019s a lot to say about sugar /sweeteners, so I\u2019ve split this topic into three parts: Part I: The Basics of Sugar (where I\u2019ll talk about real sugar) Part II: Sugar Wannabes (where I\u2019ll talk about artificial sweeteners) and Part III: Natural Sweetness (where I\u2019ll talk about new natural sweeteners , sugar alcohols & sum up).\u00a0Hope you\u2019ll stay tuned!\n(DISCLAIMER:\u00a0Please note that I am not a medical professional or a nutritionist. These posts are simply meant to provide my opinion/advice on sugars based on internet research. If you have specific questions about your consumption of sugars/sweeteners, please consult your doctor!)\nPart I: The Basics of Sugar\nOkay, let\u2019s go back to the start. What is sugar?\nSugar is an edible crystalline carbohydrate.[1]\u00a0It\u2019s tasty and sweet and we love it! Some even call sugar the \u2018other white drug\u2019! Sugar is found in many foods, including fruits, vegetables and starches. Sugar also comes in many forms, but to start, I\u2019ll just highlight three: (i) sucrose, (ii) fructose and (iii) glucose. All three are used by your body for energy. When consumed in excess, all three are stored by your body as fat.\nSo what differentiates sucrose vs. fructose vs. glucose? Ugh, well \u00a0now I have to go back to chem class[2]:\nFructose is a \u201cmonosaccharide\u201d which means it\u2019s made up of one unit of sugar. Fructose is the main sugar you get from fruits. Of the three, fructose is actually the sweetest! Fructose uptake is not regulated by insulin, so eating foods that have fructose will not have the same effects as glucose (as described below). However, recent studies suggest that consuming too much fructose can cause damage to your liver (remember the mention of cirrhosis here ?), lead to obesity and insulin resistance.[3] This is something important for diabetics (or caregivers) to note (and it will come up again in Part III)! Fructose contains 4 calories per gram.\nGlucose is also a monosaccharide. Unlike fructose, glucose intake is regulated by the insulin created by your pancreas. This means that when we eat foods that contain glucose, our blood sugar rises and is brought down only by the secretion of insulin into our bloodstream. And another fun fact: did you know that glucose is the primary source of energy for our brains? Without it, mental and physical effort can be dangerously impaired (I tried the Atkins diet once and learned this the hard way!)[4]\u00a0Glucose is found in almost everything- fruits,\u00a0bread, rice, pasta, yogurt and milk. Many complex carbohydrates (eg. whole grains) also naturally contain glucose[5].\u00a0Glucose contains 4 calories per gram.\nSucrose is a \u201cdisaccharide\u201d which means it\u2019s made up of two units of sugar (fructose and glucose had a baby!) that are linked together. Sucrose is the white table sugar you get at your average diner and is manufactured from sugar cane or sugar beet. Because sucrose contains glucose, all the same blood sugar issues that I raised above apply. \u00a0Sucrose also contains 4 calories per gram.\nI Want Some of Your Brown Sugar\nImage via Wikipedia\nA word on brown sugar. Is it healthier than white table sugar (sucrose)? Kind of like how brown rice is healthier than white rice? \u00a0I recently struggled with this issue while trying my glazed miso cod recipe . \u00a0Well as it turns out, it\u2019s more complicated than \u201cbrown\u201d= natural/healthy and \u201cwhite\u201d = unnatural/unhealthy. That\u2019s because there are two types of brown sugar:\n\u201cRaw\u201d brown sugar made from raw sugar cane; and\nBrown sugar made by mixing molasses with white (table) sugar\nThere are differing opinions out there as to which type of brown sugar is healthier, but generally my view would be to check the brown sugar you buy and err on the side of using brown sugar \u201cin the raw\u201d. The farther away you can get from processed (white) sugar the better! Brown sugar made by mixing molasses with white table sugar has almost the same nutritional content as white sugar. [6] You\u2019ll know if a brown sugar is raw because raw brown sugar tends to be coarser (larger granules) than regular brown sugar.\nThat said, here\u2019s the breakdown calories and carbohydrate-wise:\nType\n"}, {"score": 1194.1217, "uuid": "1fe95781-8de8-579a-9d01-6c0a802cc1b6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-11-12110", "target_hostname": "blog.fooducate.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.fooducate.com/2011/08/04/recent-study-were-consuming-less-sugar-or-are-we/", "page_rank": 1.1763683e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Recent Study: We\u2019re Consuming Less <em>Sugar</em>.

Or Are We?\nPin It\nA study recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition has some good news: Between the years 2000 and 2008, our daily intake of added sugars has gone down from 3.5 ounces to 2.7 ounces. That\u2019s almost a 25% decrease!\n\u201cWe were surprised to see that there was a substantial reduction over the years,\u201d said Dr. Jean Welsh, a researcher at Emory University in Atlanta and the lead author of the report. read more from Reuters\u2026\nWhen trying to interpret the data, researchers and analysts had several explanations:\n- the decrease is due to\u00a0heightened\u00a0awareness by consumers to the obesity and diabetes risks of added sugars (especially in sodas).\n- schools started to massively reduce the presence of sweetened beverages around 2000-2001.\n- Added sugars come by many different names \u2013 table sugar, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, cane juice, and more. But many manufacturers have begun using fruit juice and fruit juice concentrate as their sweeteners, and these were not technically considered as added sugars by the study. Despite their healthy \u00a0sounding name, these are sugars with no added health benefits. They just happened to come from a fruit instead of sugar can or a beet.\n- The study did not track an increase in the use of artificial sweeteners, which might end up being even worse for many of us ( here\u2019s why )\nIt seems to us that a 25% reduction in our craving for sweets in less than 10 years is highly unlikely.

The list above are the ones that are available mainstream. Do not use a substitute instead of sugar with a \"full sugar\" powdered or liquid pectin as it will not gel. Most of these pectins give instructions on when to add the sugar substitutes (usually after all the cooking, right before filling the jars). For products in which sugar is required for its preservative qualities, like jams and jellies, replacing sugar with an artificial sweetener can dramatically reduce a food's shelf life.\nWhen you are making recipes where the sugar is a preservative like in some preserves or fruit pickles, it isn't recommended to use sugar substitutes where pectin is not used. Sugar is required and the substitute will not be stable in creating heavy syrups for canning fruits such as figs, peaches or pears. It will effect the fruit's texture, flavor, and color. All or part of the sugar can be replaced by other sweeteners, such as fruit juices, honey, cane and maple syrup.\nMaple syrup can be used to replace up to 1/4 of the sugar in a recipe, but it will effect the natural flavor and color of the fruit.\nMild-flavored honey may be used to replace as much as half of the white sugar called for in your canning syrup recipe. Honey will also add flavor and color to the fruit, depending on the type of honey you use. Honey also may darken during storage. It's best to use fresh mild, light colored honey in canning.\u00a0 The make up of honey is different than sugar. A honey sweetened jam or jelly will effect the gelling and should also be used with a no sugar pectin. Using honey adds liquid to the recipe. You will want to reduce the other liquid in your recipe by 1/4 cup for each cup of honey added.\nAgave Nectar is also a sugar substitute and should be added like a honey. Since it is composed of real sugars (fructose and glucose), it performs well as a preservative. Its lower glycemic index helps protect against health risks associated with higher glycemic sweeteners. Agave is a 1:1 for honey, maple syrup and for each cup of white sugar replaced, use 2/3 of a cup of agave and reduce other liquids by 1/4 to 1/3 cup .\nSweetened pickles and relishes using sugar substitutes such as Stevia and Splenda will work but may add a mushy texture and have a strange aftertaste.

All or part of the sugar can be replaced by other sweeteners, such as fruit juices, honey, cane and maple syrup.\nMaple syrup can be used to replace up to 1/4 of the sugar in a recipe, but it will effect the natural flavor and color of the fruit.\nMild-flavored honey may be used to replace as much as half of the white sugar called for in your canning syrup recipe. Honey will also add flavor and color to the fruit, depending on the type of honey you use. Honey also may darken during storage. It's best to use fresh mild, light colored honey in canning.\u00a0 The make up of honey is different than sugar. A honey sweetened jam or jelly will effect the gelling and should also be used with a no sugar pectin. Using honey adds liquid to the recipe. You will want to reduce the other liquid in your recipe by 1/4 cup for each cup of honey added.\nAgave Nectar is also a sugar substitute and should be added like a honey. Since it is composed of real sugars (fructose and glucose), it performs well as a preservative. Its lower glycemic index helps protect against health risks associated with higher glycemic sweeteners. Agave is a 1:1 for honey, maple syrup and for each cup of white sugar replaced, use 2/3 of a cup of agave and reduce other liquids by 1/4 to 1/3 cup .\nSweetened pickles and relishes using sugar substitutes such as Stevia and Splenda will work but may add a mushy texture and have a strange aftertaste. You can use honey for your pickling but use 3/4 cup of honey for every cup of sugar. For sweet pickles use a dark honey rather than light.\nYou should experiment with small batches using your sugar substitutes for flavor and color.\nHere are some of the conversions for Splenda and Stevia,\u00a0 two sugar substitutes that are approved for canning, for measuring sugar exchanges:\nSugar\n"}, {"score": 1169.8468, "uuid": "46871a5f-5a5b-5faa-a265-7d91f2d301da", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1008wb-72-02730", "target_hostname": "www.janetgoodrichmethod.com", "target_uri": "http://www.janetgoodrichmethod.com/2007/01/19/white-sugar-and-your-eyesight/", "page_rank": 1.1897752e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Natural Vision Improvement | <em>White</em> <em>Sugar</em> and Your Eyesight", "snippet": "Alternatives such as stevia (an herb which is actually good for you, and many many times sweeter <em>than</em> <em>sugar</em>), maple syrup and fruit juice concentrates <em>are</em> more and more available, and being chosen by consumers as the facts about <em>white</em> <em>sugar</em> (and <em>artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em>) continue to emerge into the mainstream", "explanation": null, "document": "By Carina Goodrich\nWhy Change to other sweeteners for good eyesight?\nI just finished reading \u2018Beekeeping for Dummies\u2019, like obviously many other (crazy?) folk, I am excited by the idea of \u2018growing\u2019 and harvesting my own honey.\u00a0 For all of my life, \u2018alternative\u2019 sweeteners have been the norm, due to my mother\u2019s interest in nutritional health and good eyesight.\u00a0 Honey is the main sweetener we use, being able to find local fresh and raw honey out here in the countryside.\u00a0 With four sweet tooths (or is it teeth?) in the house, we definitely get through the honey.\nAside from the fascinating world that honey opens your eyes to, and the amazing properties of other natural sugar substitutes, why avoid white sugar? There are several reasons. The most prominent in relation to refractive error has to do with a trace mineral called chromium. White sugar in the body sneaks into the mineral reserves and steals away chromium. A lack of chromium has been demonstrated to be a significant factor in the development of myopia.\nChromium is essential for glucose utilization in muscle fibers, making it necessary for good muscle function. Chromium aids in the process of glucose uptake in insulin receptors, affecting spleen function and other blood sugar issues.\u00a0 Sufficient levels of chromium allow the muscle around the lens to sustain near focus as well as the ability to change focal length, for extended periods.\nChromium is a nutrient that already tends to be a bit scarce particularly in the standard modern diet.\u00a0 The effect of white sugar leaching already scanty chromium supplies in the body is of major concern in our modern world where sugar is packed into just about every kind of processed food imaginable, and in much higher quantities than our bodies were designed to cope with. Particularly for children on a white sugar, white flour, even moderate amount of junk food diet, the sugar intake is enough to cause life-long effects.\nSome of these are visible, such as blood sugar imbalances resulting in behavioral changes, or obesity, but some effects are internal and only show themselves through symptoms such as reduced vision.\nIt is interesting to note that the World Health Organization listed processed sugar as one of the five substances to which citizens of industrial nations are addicted.\nFoods which contain biologically available chromium include: brewer\u2019s yeast, liver, wheat germ (fresh), whole wheat, beetroot, thyme and mushrooms.\nSugar also affects your moods, meaning that a habit of going on the \u2018sugar hit\u2019 rollercoaster can be rough on your state of mind and those around you.\u00a0 The boost to your blood sugar level that comes with white sugar is hard and fast, then quickly drops you in the energy and mood trough, looking for the next hit.\u00a0 Your body actually craves complex foods, which provide energy to burn for hours, and minerals to keep all the cell processes going.\nEven if you eat a generally healthy diet, containing plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, pretty much eliminating white sugar from your diet will help your visual system to better achieve the required nutrient levels for good eyesight. Be aware that often a craving for sugar indicates a lack of minerals in the body. Try increasing your nutritional mineral intake to help make a quicker transition from sugar cravings to good food cravings, and improve your energy levels.\n\u201cBodies are made of food,\u201d said Dr. Janet Goodrich in her book Help Your Child to Perfect Eyesight without Glasses.\u00a0 Everyday remind yourself that food is both your fuel and what all the new cells in your body are made from.\u00a0 Food is also a comfort and a pleasure.\u00a0 I believe in a diet that is 85-95% healthy and body wise, and the other 5-15% for enjoyment of life in a body!\nWhether you live in the city or the country, food producers are finding better ways to process and distribute natural foods that give sweetness without the negative side effects of sugar.\u00a0 Alternatives such as stevia (an herb which is actually good for you, and many many times sweeter than sugar), maple syrup and fruit juice concentrates are more and more available, and being chosen by consumers as the facts about white sugar (and artificial sweeteners) continue to emerge into the mainstream.\nPlease remember that artificial sweeteners are usually toxic and we do not recommend them. When finding substitutes for sugar, ensure that they are natural products, which your body will be able to enjoy, process and eliminate without harmful side effects.\nMy favourite, honey, is the oldest known sweetener and has many health benefits when eaten raw. These derive from its antibacterial qualities and the presence of small amounts of pollen (which is very high in nutrients).\nMany cultures ingest approx. 1 teaspoon per day of raw honey as a nutritional supplement.\u00a0 Eating raw local honey in this manner (harvested within a 50 mile radius) can also help relieve the symptoms of pollen related allergies.\nWhen used in baking honey helps baked goods stay fresh and moist longer.\u00a0 Be aware that strong flavoured honeys may influence the taste, so choose a mild flavoured honey for cooking.\u00a0 In Beekeeping for Dummies, Howland Blackiston offers the following helpful advice: when substituting honey for sugar in baking, follow these guidelines;\nReduce the amount of liquid in the recipe by \u00bc cup for each cup of honey used.\nAdd \u00bd teaspoon of baking soda for each cup of honey.\nReduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees (F) to prevent overbrowning.\nAsk at your local supermarket and health food store for their range of natural sugar substitutes.\u00a0 And if you can find a source of fresh, raw honey, it\u2019s definitely worth it to stock up!\u00a0 (Honey also keeps very well.\u00a0 Stores were found in the tombs of the Egyptian Pharaohs that were still edible!)\n\u00a9 Carina Goodrich\nDiet, nutrition and many other important topics are discussed in great detail during our regular live tele-class programs.

Both will affect your blood sugar level about equally.\nIt is a common misconception that honey is healthier than sugar. After all, it's more \"natural\" than the commonly used, heavily refined white sugar and has a long history of use in home remedies. But honey actually contains several simple sugars: fructose, glucose, sucrose and others.\nPound for pound, the nutrients in honey and white sugar are about the same. Note, however, that a teaspoon of honey weighs more than a teaspoon of white sugar, so honey has slightly more calories when measured with household measures. To be exact, a teaspoon of white sugar has 15 calories and a teaspoon of honey has 21 calories.\nHoney is sweeter than white sugar, so if you care for the taste of honey as a sweetener, you may be able to get by with using less to sweeten foods. However, since honey has slightly more carbohydrates and calories per teaspoon, the bloodsugar savings you'll get by making this switch are going to be small.\nHere's the take-home: Honey isn't healthier for diabetics than sugar, so you should use the one you like the taste of better, but both should be used in moderation. You need to be sure to count these extra carbohydrates in your eating plan, because whether they come from sugar or honey, they will affect your bloodsugar about equally.

Stevita makes a Stevia that tastes very much like sugar.\nBelow is the story of Stevia and how industry and the FDA have tried to prevent the knowledge of its healthful effects, so that the deadly neurotoxic drug aspartame will have no competition. Aspartame, of course, can precipitate diabetes, keeps blood sugar out of control, destroys the optic nerve and can cause diabetics to go into convulsions. It also interacts with insulin and no doubt is responsible for the epidemic of diabetes.\nStevia was outlawed by the European Union and when I visited them in Belgium and asked why was told there were no studies to show safety. I explained there were about 500, tell me where to send them. What I got was \"silence\". The article explains why. Parliament has voted now to re-examine aspartame and Stevia, but its only the first step.\nAspartame is also the reason for the epidemic of obesity as its a neurotoxic drug that makes you crave carbohydrates so you gain weight. (See protest of National Soft Drink Association on www.dorway.com). It is also makes the liver so toxic as it embalms you (Trocho Study, l998), that its hard to even lose weight.\nIn April l994, Dr. Robert Atkins (recently deceased) wrote a special supplement to his newsletter, Health Revelations. It was titled Artificial Sugar: A Sweet and Dangerous Lure. All about aspartame. It called it Low-cal Weight Gain and said: \"In a peculiar finding that strikes at the very existence of the sweetener, 39 of the people in Roberts study (referring to H. J. Roberts, M.D., diabetic specialist and world expert on aspartame, author of the medical text on the global plague of aspartame disease - Aspartame Disease: An Ignored Epidemic, gained weight, averaging 19 pounds per person. Considerable evidence supports this metabolic effect. Dr. John Olney of Washington University Medical Center devoted two decades of his brilliant career to demonstrating the harmful effects of glutamate (MSG) which produces the same effect as aspartate, one of the main constituents of aspartame. Olney showed that.\n*Glutamate, in animal experiments, damaged areas of the brain controlling endocrine function, which led to pathological obesity.\n* Aspartame has the same ability as glutamate to destroy those brain cells.\nWhat a painful irony if you and I switch to artificial sweeteners in our desire to lose weight and then are sabotaged by the metabolic effects of this \"weight loss\" ingredient.\nDon't forget, obesity in America has increased by 30 percent in the past decade, the same period in which aspartame has been introduced. It now accounts for 70 percent of our artificial sweetener use and a quarter of total sweetener use.\nObesity, of course, is metabolically related to diabetes, and Roberts noted many cases of diabetics whose blood glucose control was thrown off by aspartame. We at the Atkins Center have initiated a study of overweight people with sugar disorders to see if their weight and glucose control vary with aspartame intake.\" (end of Dr. Atkins quote from his newsletter).\nI might mention that the European Union was presented with a good deal of Dr. Roberts research and shown the 1038 page medical text, Aspartame Disease: An Ignored Epidemic. To show you beyond any shadow of a doubt that in saying their review showed safety of aspartame they knew they were being deceptive, they actually left out of their review all of Dr. Roberts damaging research !!\nAnd failed to mention that a huge medical text had been had been published on the deadly, deadly effects of aspartame, the drug interactions and the legal implications of mass poisoning the public.\nOver and over again I mentioned to them \"you have to care, you have to care\". They have shown they didn't care. I asked them if they were aligned with industry and they said no, obviously they are. You couldn't look at all the damning reports I left with Mr. Peter Wagstaffe and Mr. Miguel-Angel.Granero-Rosell and not know that\u00a0 we are dealing with a global plague of Aspartame Disease.\nI gave them the testimony of Dr. Louis Elsas, pediatric professor, genetics, Emory University, on how aspartame triggers birth defects and mental retardation. I showed them the report Aspartame Murders Infants and how it destroys every part of the fertility process. And said again, you have to care about millions of babies being murdered in their mother's womb. It made no difference to them.\nI gave them the Board of Inquiry Report of the FDA saying aspartame is not safe, triggers brain tumors, and petition is revoked and aspartame can't be approved. Of course, we know of the politics that was involved and how Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes over-ruled that Board of Inquiry and then went to work for the PR Agency of the manufacturer.\nTo help the effort and get the truth to the public, Bob Flint, Mission Possible Maine has put the largest congressional hearing (there were 3) on CD along with the Board of Inquiry report of the FDA saying aspartame is not safe, and Dr. John Olney's testimony to the Board of Inquiry, for only $5.00.\nThe summation only of the Board of Inquiry is on www.dorway.com along with the actual FDA audit, the Bressler Report. I want you to know I have personally spoke to Jerome Bressler and thanked for writing the truth, and he informed his report was so damning that the FDA removed 20% of it as well as a cover letter. He told me of two mice studies that were also very, very damning.\nOriginally the FDA wanted the manufacturer indicted for fraud but the pharmaceutical company was so powerful that both United States Prosecutors hired on with the defense team and the statute of limitations expired.\nRead on about this wonderful, safe sweetener they actually outlawed in Europe, that needs to be re-approved. I got a call from the UK from someone telling me Monsanto was behind it, hearsay though it might be, I hear what they are saying, and have heard it for years. There is a saying where there is smoke there is fire, but this is a large conflagration blazing out of control.\nI am glad to see this article on Stevia, which tells the story we've been telling for years. Parliament needs to read it as well. Incidentally, Dr. Atkins in this supplement also mentioned Stevia. Remember this was written in l994. He says: \"In Japan, stevia has been used for 17 years to replace sugar. It now constitutes 40 to 50 percent of the sweetener ingested in Japan.\nMore than 300,000 pounds are consumed a year, and no adverse reactions have been described in Japanese scientific literature.\" However, just a few weeks ago Japan released a new study on aspartame again showing DNA damage (which we have known about for over 20 years) and infertility in men.\nDr. James Bowen in Aspartame Murders Infants (www.dorway.com) said: \"At every point in the fertility process aspartame destroys, beginning with the gleam in Mom and Pop's eyes it ruins female sexual response and induces male sexual dysfunction.\nBeyond this aspartame disrupts fetal development by aborting it or inducing defects. And if a live child is born aspartame may have heinously damaged the DNA of the baby cursing future generations.\" I left this paper with the European Union and begged them to care which they didn't. There is now a 59 page report of rebuttal on the European Union report showing all their errors and coverup.\nRead on for the article on Stevia and lets all lend our support and knowledge to the European Parliament to bring back this wonderful, healthful herb and remove aspartame from the planet. Stay away from other toxic sweeteners. A very bad one is Sucralose or Splenda which has a chlorinated base like DDT and can cause autoimmune disease. Asculfame K is another horrible sweetener that caused cancer and leukemia in original studies and we often get reactions to these toxins.\nBetty Martini, Founder, Mission Possible Intl, 9270 River Club Parkway, Duluth, Georgia 30097, 770 242-2599 www.dorway.com\nFrom Marianne Payton mpayton@cfl.rr.com To Betty Martini\nThe convoluted history of FDA's protection of the artificial sweetener market for Aspartame (nutrasweet/equal) follows:\nWhat is STEVIA?\nA South American herb that is up to 400 times sweeter than sugar with only ten (10) calories per pound, stevia is the perfect sugar replacement for persons suffering from diabetes, which helps to actually regulate blood-sugar levels. Medical doctors in Japan and Germany routinely use stevia in their treatment of diabetic patients, as well as those with candidiasis (a chronic yeast infection that thrives on sugar, also implicated in auto-immune disorders (AIDS), chronic fatigue syndrome, etc.) And unlike aspartame (Nutrasweet) and its cousins, stevia is perfect for use in baking, cooking and as a food additive that happens to sweeten. It is so powerfully sweet that 1/2 teaspoon is approximately equivalent to one (1) cup of sugar in sweetening capabilities.\nThe History Behind STEVIA.\nUsed as a sweetener for a thousand years in what is now northeastern Paraguay by native peoples, stevia rebuadiana is perhaps the only known plant to worry the sweetener industry today. First published accounts of the miraculous uses of this herb go as far back as 1576 by Spanish physician Francisco Hernandez in his book, \"Natural History of Plants of the New Spain\" after Spanish conquistadors arrived on the shores of South America. This widespread native use to sweeten the taste of mate' and other bitter beverages and medicinal potions, and to treat many ailments was much chronicled in historical documents.\nIntroduced to settlers, the use spread to other parts of the continent, notably Brazil and Argentina, and was again documented in 1887 when Dr. Moises Santiage Bertoni began \"rediscovering\" this herb after much research, naming his variety after a chemist named Rebaudi who became the first to extract the plants' sweet constituent.\nSo impressed by the plants' sweetening capabilities, he declared it \"so superior to sugar that it is no need to wait for results of analyses and cultures to affirm its economic advantage - the simple test proves it.\" In 1908, the first harvest of a stevia crop occurred, a ton from its natural habitat. Soon stevia plantations sprung up, making this a viable agricultural crop with use increasing even outside of Latin America.\nBrought to the attention of the U.S. Government in 1918 by a U.S. Department of Agriculture botanist, the herb raised concerns in the business community.\nThree years later American Trade Commissioner George S. Brady presented stevia to the USDA, taking note of its non-toxicity, is ability to be used in natural form with only drying and grinding, and claims of \"an idea and safe sugar for diabetics\".\nNothing further became of Stevias' potential introduction to the American market, although a German report later mentioned receiving specimens \"of the well known plant, which alarmed sugar producers some years ago.\" In 1931, chemists in France isolated the two chemical compounds responsible for the sweet taste, developing the first crystalline extract.\nWithin decades the Japanese began using stevia as the idea replacement for sugar and its synthetic substitutes after banning or strictly regulating artificial sweeteners and other chemicals in food sources during the 1960's.\nBy 1988, Stevia products represented 41% of the market of sweet substances consumed in Japan, as well as being commonly found to sweeten a variety of food products on the manufacturing level, including ice cream, soft drinks, bread and candies.\nToday the use of Stevia has spread to many countries not only in Japan and South America, but in China, Germany, Korea, Israel, and others. Stevias' safety has been repeatedly proven through extensive scientific testing and hundreds of years of use.\nWhy is STEVIA not well known in the United States?\nBy the mid-1980's, Stevia was poised to debut on the American marketplace, with Celestial Seasonings and Thomas J. Lipton Tea Company eager to market herbal teas using this herb that is natural, almost non-caloric and is safe for diabetics.\nSuddenly, due to an \"anonymous trade complaint\" from a company that did not want stevia made available to consumers (generally acknowledged as coming from the makers of aspartame), the FDA banned import of the herb into the U.S., and initiated search and seizures (complete with armed federal marshals) in manufacturing facilities, storage warehouses - anywhere where there was potential distribution or use of the herb.\nClaiming the herb as \"a non-safe food additive\" despite acknowledging it has \"been used throughout history,\" the FDA refused to respond to petitions filed by the American Herbal Products and Lipton Tea Company, denying official GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) status, even trying to prohibit the petitions to be filed, a routine procedure that does not require any approval. The FDA's citing of \"studies\" regarding the safety of stevia are so incomplete and unrealistic they are deemed absurd by most standards with the professor of one study (Professor Joseph Kuc) stating the \"studies need to be redone,\" conceding his findings \"do not constitute an important reason for keeping stevia off the U.S. market.\" The FDA refuses to even read or acknowledge studies indicating safety and benefits of the herb from Japan and Germany.\nYet, the FDA shows a double standard regarding the tens of thousands of consumer complaints regarding aspartame (Nutrasweet and the like), much less the reports and studies of brain tumors, headaches, blindness and seizures.\nThe potential deadly and toxic effects of this pharmachemical far surpasses any remote possible effects of stevia in even the highest dosages. Fortunately, with the passing of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in 1994, legislation was enacted to market many vitamins, minerals, herbs and botanicals as a \"dietary supplement.\"\nSuch supplements are no longer classified as \"food additives\" and are not subject to intensive safety testing. While there is some potential of mis-use and exploitation in this area, the benefits far outweigh the restrictions placed before consumers to use the natural substances of their choice. It is, and should be the consumer's responsibility and right to acquire knowledge of dietary products, particularly for health and medicinal use.\nThe Future of Stevia.\nThe release of stevia to be not only imported into this country, but also commercially grown, (you too can grow your own plants), opens the door for the future common availability of this herb in every supermarket and as an additive to processed food in the U.S. While the battle to market stevia as an alternative sweetener to sugar is far from over, the time will come sooner than later. Thomas J. Lipton is still involved with petitions and suites to gain status to have the herb labeled GRAS.\nMore and more everyday folks are discovering this herb, and it will once again be America's \"grass roots\" movement, not corporate America or our government, that will succeed in deciding what we ultimately put into our bodies by choice.\nHow To Use Stevia Herb as a \"Dietary Supplement.\"\nMost stevia that is presently imported comes in its raw, powdered form, or cut and sifted, although there are some sources that provide a liquid extract, and even a white crystalline form. The raw, powdered form has a nice green color with some slight crystals. This is usually from the best of over 200 species of plants named Stevia rebuadiana Bertoni, which has little of the bitterness sometimes associated with some other species. The number and variety of species account for the wide range of sweetness comparisons to sugar, with 400 times sweeter being the highest, and 200-300 times as being the average. Such a small amount is needed to sweeten a cup of coffee or tea, for instance, that dipping the tip of your pinkie finger into the powder is as much stevia herb as would be required. Although it can be used in baking far more successfully than aspartame, it still doesn't rise as much as sugar, and doesn't really have the browning capabilities (your sugar cookie recipe will remain a pretty white). Most people experiment and often will start out by reducing the amount of sugar, replacing the other half with stevia.\nRemember that a teaspoon is roughly equivalent to one cup of sugar. The powder is so fine, some cooks experienced in using stevia prefer using the extract drops. The key is to play and have fun finding the right amount of sweetness for your taste buds. The herb is available at most herb and wholistic health-oriented stores.\nThe best method of getting the word out to the general public is tell your friends and family about this great herb. Do research, read all that you can - you may be required to help put pressure or lend support to those who want to see the benefits of this herb reach the American public. Most of the information for this article was taken from a wonderful book entitled The Stevia Story by Linda Bonvie, Bill Bonvie and Donna Gates, published by B.E.D. Publications Co. [ISBN: 0-9638458-1-0]. This book is often available at wholistic bookstores and health/food markets, but your nearest regular bookstore can order it.\n****** The benefits of stevia as a sweetener are unrivaled: * Stevia actually balances blood sugar levels, and is safe for use by both diabetics and hypoglycemics.\n* Unlike aspartame, there are no reports of adverse effects from stevia's use and scientific studies throughout the world prove out its safety. Stevia has never been shown to cause brain tumors, seizures, blindness, or any of the other 92 adverse reactions associated with aspartame.\n* Unlike aspartame, stevia reduces the craving for sweets, making it the ideal sweetener for a society desperate to lose weight. * Unlike sugar, stevia reduces cavities by retarding the growth of plaque. * Stevia is used as a digestive aid in Brazil. * Stevia contains antiseptic properties which have proven beneficial in speeding the healing process of skin wounds.\n* Tests show that stevia's antimicrobial properties inhibit the growth of streptococcus and other bacteria. This is especially noteworthy since some forms of streptococcus have become antibiotic resistant.\nEmperor's Herbologist JAJA Stevioside is sold in Germany, England, Australia, Japan, France, the USA, and many other countries around the world\n\"A man's mind stretched to a new idea never goes back to its original dimensions.\" Oliver Wendell Holmes\n\"I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.\" Thomas Jefferson*\n\"For the rest of my life I want to reflect on what Light is.\" Albert Einstein\n(Note:\u00a0 Aspartame is manufactured by G.

If you don&#x27;t like <em>artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em>, you don&#x27;t have to use them.", "explanation": null, "document": "Read Nutrition Facts labels to know how much sugar is in the foods you buy.\nShereen Jegtvig\nHow Much Sugar Can I Have?\nThe World Health Organization suggests that no more than 10% of your daily calories come from added sugar. That's a good goal. So let's turn that into grams, so you can use Nutrient Facts Labels to track your sugar consumption. Last week, you calculated the number of calories you should be taking in every day (if you didn't - go back and review the first lesson ). Only 10% of that number of calories should come from added sugars . For example, if you need 2,000 calories per day, than only 200 calories should come from extra sugar. You can determine how many grams of sugar that is by dividing the number by 4 (there are 4 calories in one gram of sugar). So in our example, 200 calories would equal 50 grams of sugar.\nIf you don't like calculating numbers or that seems like a drastic cut in sugar, then you can choose a different goal. Look at your food diary from last week. How many sugary foods did you eat or drink each day? Do you usually drink three cans of a sugary soda? You can set a goal of just one soda each day (without adding any additional sugary foods). Did you start most of your days with a sweet mocha latte from the coffee shop? How about switching to drip coffee or tea a few days each week? Once you meet these goals, you can set new ones.\nUsing Sugar as a Condiment\nYou don't have to give up sugar completely - you can use sugar like a condiment instead of an ingredient. Each teaspoon of sugar has 16 calories or 4 grams of sugar. So instead of buying a presweetened breakfast cereal with 15 grams of sugar in one serving, buy a whole grain cereal and add some fruit and sprinkle a little sugar on top. You'll get your sweet flavor, but you'll eat a lot less sugar.\nYou can use honey the same way. Nutritionally, honey is about the same as sugar, but since it adds more flavor, you may use a teaspoon of honey on some of your foods.\nUsing Artificial Sweeteners\nArtificial sweeteners, which are also called \"non-nutritive sweeteners,\" add sweetness to many foods and beverages without adding any calories or nutrition. They are well-known ingredients in diet sodas and snacks, and some are easily identified in little colorful packets alongside sugar in your favorite coffee shop or restaurant. Common sweeteners include saccharin (Sweet'N Low), Sucralose (Splenda) and aspartame (Nutrasweet). Another non-caloric natural sweetener is an herb called stevia .\nSome people find the use of artificial sweeteners to be controversial, although there is plenty of research that demonstrates the safety of these sweeteners. Some people object to the flavor of artificial sweeteners, which are different from natural sugars. If you don't like artificial sweeteners, you don't have to use them. If you like the non-nutritive sweeteners, just remember that while they don't add calories to your diet, they really don't add anything good either. So, go ahead and replace a regular soda with a diet soda, but don't use them to replace healthy beverages such as milk, 100% fruit juices, water and vegetable juice.\nTips for Reducing the Sugar in Your Diet\nBuy fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, whole grain breads and pasta, plain oatmeal, lean meats, poultry, fish, and dairy products (other than sugar-sweetened yogurts). Avoid the overly processed foods and read the labels on packaged foods to look for added sugar. Buy plain yogurt and add a little bit of honey, some chopped nuts and lots of blueberries.\nServe fresh berries for dessert instead of ice cream. Make your own trail mix with dried fruit, mixed nuts and whole-grain cereal and take to work for a snack instead of candy bars, cookies or pastries.\nAdd a lemon slice to sparkling soda instead of sugary soda.\nAvoid ice cream sundaes, malts and shakes, and cold, blended coffee drinks, which are all high in sugar. Mix 100% fruit juice with club soda for a healthier soft-drink.\nBuy fresh fruit instead of cookies and pastries.\nMost of the fruit smoothies sold at coffee shops are filled with added sugar and not much fruit. Make your own smoothies at home with bananas, berries and a little non-fat milk.\nYour Assignments This Week\nNow that you're going to pay more attention to the added sugar in your diet, choose a goal similar to one of these:\nI will only drink one can of sugary soda instead of three cans on at least three days this week (or four days or all week).\nI will eat less than X number of grams of sugar three days this week (or four or five days). Calculate that number by using the example from the reading.\nContinue to use your food diary. It will help you keep track of how you are progressing.\nYour next lesson will help you incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet, even if you're a picky eater - very important because fruits and vegetables are so good for your health.\nAdded Sugar Quiz\nReady to test your knowledge on added sugar?

Not only are consumers getting increasingly angry - once they find out what causes their ills and they get off the poison - but threatening black scientific and legislative clouds are lining the horizon as well.\nItalian study\nA large multi-year study of a private Italian health research foundation has acutely confirmed what studies in the 1980s had already found: brain tumors and other unsavory effects of aspartame consumption. The study, which used laboratory animals to test the cancer hypothesis, has been published by Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP), a monthly journal of peer-reviewed research and news on the impact of the environment on human health. The article is available on the EHP website .\nThe study's authors said that previous studies on aspartame were too short to show the cancer causing potential of the substance: \"In our opinion, previous studies did not comply with today's basic requirements for testing the carcinogenic potential of a physical or chemical agent, in particular concerning the number of rodents for each experimental group (40 - 86, compared to 100 - 150 in the current study) and the termination of previous studies at only 110 weeks of age of the animals.\"\nThe study has made headline news, but most countries are wary to take a first step - the FDA is held in high esteem, although opinions might be changing after recent scandals have shaken in the agency.\nConsumer complaints\nConsumer complaints about aspartame were collected by the FDA and in a rare slip, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in February of 1994 released a listing of adverse reactions. There are some 92, the listing can be found in Aspartame... the BAD news! . Apparently aspartame accounted for more than 75% of all adverse reactions reported to the FDA's Adverse Reaction Monitoring System.\nThe FDA is in a very unenviable position. It has approved a neurotoxic carcinogen to be used as an artificial sweetener and complaints are piling up to where they are difficult to hide. But once the sweetener was approved it became almost impossible for the agency to admit wrongdoing, without unleashing a scandal the likes of which has not been seen since the thalidomide disaster.\nNew Mexico\nAgainst this background, there is now action in the New Mexico legislature to hear evidence about aspartame's health effects. Heaven forbid that there should be hearings, Ajinomoto, the principal manufacturer of aspartame, has hit the ceiling. Lawyers hired by Ajinomoto appeared before New Mexico regulatory boards to argue why the fact that aspartame has FDA approval should prevent any independent hearings from taking place. The Calorie Control Council, a group close to industry, was called in to help. They dutifully attempted to demolish the Italian study saying it did not follow the guidelines of the National Toxicology Program...\nThe people pressure against aspartame comes from a network of former 'addicts' who have kicked the diet habit and from doctors who have seen the damage and halted or reversed it in their patients. Books have been written (look at the Amazon ads in the side bar ... hint, hint) that condemn the sweetener and document its ill effects, aspartame detoxification programs and aspartame help groups exist, a video Sweet Misery: A Poisoned World documents the history of aspartame's approval and its egregious side effects.\nA tireless lady by the name of Betty Martini, who founded Mission Possible is arguably the most well known among the aspartame opponents, although hers is not a lonely crusade. Aspartame users (mostly ex, to be sure) and doctors in some 30 countries are involved. They swear they won't rest until the poison has been removed from the food supply and those responsible for overriding science and covering up the deadly effects are brought to justice.\nIt is Betty Martini who wrote the following two letters, one to the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board and another, more recent one, to the Governor and the Attorney General of New Mexico. While her tone reflects her frustration of seeing official inaction in the face of an obvious catastrophe, we should not make light of what she has to say. Her comments and documentation go well beyond the immediate issue of the New Mexico hearings.\nAnyone serious about understanding what the aspartame controversy is all about would do well to read her letters. That includes any health officials who might be reading this article - especially! I have added some links to the references in the letters, to make it easier for those interested to arrive at the documents...\n- - -\nWhy New Mexico must not capitulate to the flimsy and flawed arguments by the world's largest Aspartame Manufacturer, Ajinomoto, regarding ostensible FDA preemption for Aspartame, and Ajinomoto's corporate attempts to prevent two Board hearings on Aspartame's Neurotoxicity\nLetter to the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Deputy Attorney General of New Mexico\n----------------------------\nThe Honorable William Blaine Richardson\nThe Honorable Patricia Madrid\nThe Honorable Stuart Bluestone\nDear Governor Richardson, Attorney General Patricia Madrid, and Deputy Attorney General Stuart Bluestone:\nBelow please find the letter I wrote the EIB [Environmental Improvement Board] in September proving that aspartame violates both State and Federal Statutes on Adulteration. I want each of you to take the time to read the EIB letter from September, and this more current one to you with my responses to the Ajinomoto of Japan's New Mexico lawyer's brief asking that the Board of Pharmacy not move forward with any hearing on aspartame's neurotoxicity. Thus, you will know that aspartame is a product that is poisonous, mislabeled, and adulterative, making it unfit for human consumption.\nIf aspartame were under consideration for approval today based on science instead of by the politics of Don Rumsfeld , there is no way it would be approved today. The FDA refused approval for 16 years, and at one point, even asked the Justice Department to prosecute the manufacturer for fraud and submission of false documents! This is the first and only time in its history that FDA did this. However both prosecutors, Sam Skinner and William Conlon, hired on with the defense team representing the industries, and the statute of limitations expired.\nFDA continued to deny approval, and another branch of the Federal Government, the Department of Defense, was doing research on using aspartame as a biological weapon against other nations. Then Donald Rumsfeld, President of G.D. Searle, who was also on Reagan's transition team, \"called in his markers,\" as he worded it, and his choice for the new FDA Commissioner, Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes, was appointed. It mattered not that aspartame was a proven carcinogen and triggered in original studies brain, mammary, uterine, ovarian, testicular, pancreatic and thyroid tumors, as well as testicular atrophy, polyps and seizures.\nDr. Adrian Gross, FDA toxicologist, told Congress that aspartame, without a shadow of a doubt triggers brain cancer and violates the Delaney Amendment forbidding carcinogenic additives. Hayes ignored the objection of his own Public Board of Inquiry and approved it in 1981. Dr. Gross told Congress in 1985 that since it triggers brain tumors, FDA could not by law have set an allowable daily dose. In 1987 FDA toxicologist, Dr. Jacqueline Verrett, testified to Congress that all Searle's studies were built on a foundation of sand and should be thrown out; it had not been proven safe, though it was on the market in thousands of products at that time.\nFDA is the handmaiden of Big Pharma, their loyal attack dog. Dr. James Bowen of Hawaii, who has Lou Gehrig's caused by aspartame, has written that before the FDA approved aspartame, it was intact, but once it was approved and FDA had to lie about its safety, it is as though they no longer cared. One employee of the FDA told the mother of an aspartame-seizure victim:\n\"We revoked the petition for approval; we tried to indict the company; we said it wasn't safe, and we said it caused seizures and brain tumors. They should have listened to us. Now what do you want us to do?\"\nOn www.mpwhi.com/main.htm please see the Bressler Report, an FDA audit by Jerome Bressler, now retired. It gives the manufacturer indigestion. I thanked Mr. Bressler for his candor in letting the world know how deadly aspartame is, and he told me the studies were much worse than his FDA Audit showed because when they retyped it, they removed the worst 20%. He didn't say who was behind it but to look for two mice studies and a cover letter and I would learn how bad it is. Dr. Bressler repeated this to Dr. Russell Blaylock, a neurosurgeon who spoke to him on the matter. Dr. H. J. Roberts of Palm Beach Florida asked his congressman to get the missing records. The FDA wrote the congressman that the information is confidential and they would not release it. That is against the law, of course, but if the FDA released this particular information, they'd be found guilty of altering reports.\nDr. John Olney, one of the world's most renowned neuroscientists [who] founded the field of neuroscience called excitotoxicity, after doing the studies on MSG and aspartic acid, the acid which constitutes 40% of aspartame by molecular weight. He found lesions in the brains of mice from these chemicals and tried to prevent aspartame approval. (An excitotoxin is a biochemical that literally stimulates the neurons of the brain to death. Neurosurgeon Russell Blaylock wrote a book on this subject - Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills ).\nDr. Olney, fed up with all the fraud, insisted that Searle do studies in his lab so he could oversee them, and prevent manipulation. The studies showed brain damage. Dr. Olney thought it would never be approved, but didn't realize that Searle simply deleted those studies from its report to FDA.\nIn 14 years, I've spoken to a lot of informants and could give a course on how manufacturers of aspartame manipulate studies, and mislead the public. You simply cannot get a chemical poison like aspartame, a deadly, deadly neurotoxic drug, and carcinogen, to show safety unless you manipulate the studies for that purpose.\nOne study pivotal in the approval of aspartame was a 52-week oral toxicity study on 7 infant monkeys. Five had grand mal seizures and one died. However, it's very well known that aspartame is a seizure triggering drug, and interacts with anti-seizure medication and all medication and vaccines. It damages the mitochondria of the cells; this is one of the reasons, and, of course, it is a chemical hypersensitization agent that triggers polychemical sensitivity syndrome.\nThe FDA report of 92 symptoms from 10,000 volunteered consumer complaints, more that the complaints to FDA about all other food additives combined, is on www.mpwhi.com/main.htm (In other words, the FDA's own 92 symptom chart shows four different kinds of seizures triggered by aspartame!)\nMonsanto, which bought Searle in 1985, decided they would do studies to show safety and put the minds of the people at rest. Here's what they did, in this hopelessly flawed double-blind study funded by Monsanto, the Rowen study of 1995:\nThey were so afraid somebody would have a seizure they actually had 16 of the 18 subjects taking anti-seizure medication during the study. They knew the CDC showed that most seizures linked to aspartame don't appear until three or more months of real world aspartame use, so they did a ONE DAY study with subjects all having been given in advance anti-seizure medication!\nThe aspartame was in capsules, so instead of spiking the plasma phenylalanine level and significantly changing the phenylalanine/LNAA ratio, the phenylalanine was absorbed very slowly -- more like what happens when ingesting food (Stegink 1987). These researchers discussed in detail the issue of plasma phenylalanine and LNAA levels. It was particularly absurd that they gave the aspartame in capsules, even though they cited industry research (Burns l990) that proves capsulated aspartame eliminates the spike in plasma phenylalanine! The researchers were pretending to test the hypothesis that phenylalanine/LNAA ratio changes cause seizures, but intentionally skewed their dog-and-pony show to get the result they wanted.\nCapsulated aspartame slows the absorption of methanol and may reduce its toxicity somewhat similar to the way ingestion of food with methanol may slightly reduce its toxicity (Posner 1975) and also eliminates the quick absorption of the excitotoxin, aspartic acid (Stegink 1987). When aspartic acid is absorbed quickly, it is extremely excitotoxic (Blaylock 1994, Olney 1980), especially in conjunction with formaldehyde that comes from the methanol in aspartame.\nThis \"study\" consisted of ONLY ONE SINGLE DOSE of aspartame ingestion. This was comparable to the test subjects just smelling the bottle! The results of this study only apply to people who take a single dose of encapsulated aspartame while they're on anti-seizure medication. Not only is this study worthless, but also key information wasn't in the abstract; namely, the fact the subjects were on anti-seizure medication and that the aspartame was in capsules. This is just one example, and there are indeed hundreds, of the tactics used by the manipulative criminals in the aspartame industry who are trying to prevent two board hearings and investigations by the state of New Mexico into their manipulative techniques to conceal and misrepresent evidence!\nRalph Walton M.D. did an independent study on aspartame, and Monsanto, knowing they could not control the study, even refused to sell him the aspartame. After one man had a retinal detachment (the methanol in aspartame converts to formaldehyde and formic acid destroys the optic nerve) and lost vision in that eye, and another subject had conjunctival bleeding while others reporting they were being poisoned, the study was halted. You CANNOT do an honest study on this chemical poison and show safety. Poisons are always poisons - period. Dr. Walton's study is on www.wnho.net .\nFurther, in 1996 when Dr. John Olney made world news on the aspartame/brain tumor association, Dr. Walton joined him on 60 Minutes with his research on peer-reviewed studies and funding, showing 92% of independent peer reviewed studies reveal the problems aspartame causes. Dr. Walton also stated if you removed the studies FDA had something to do with, 100% of independent studies show the problems with aspartame. Read this study on www.mpwhi.com/main.htm .\nSo if all independent studies show problems, what does this say about industry controlled/ funded studies that say aspartame is so safe? And why do the manufacturers threaten researchers who do these independent studies? Dr. Richard Wurtman of the Brain Studies Department of MIT testified before Congress on how dangerous this drug is. He also decided to do studies on aspartame and seizures, but was threatened by the VP of Searle that if he did his research, his funding would be terminated. Today Dr. Wurtman refuses to speak out about aspartame, yet MIT is getting funding again. However, he couldn't destroy the paper trail on how deadly aspartame is. Although Wurtman edited \"Dietary Phenylalanine and Brain Function,\" this book is now removed from MIT, but many of his reports are on our web sites explaining the toxicity.\nGregory Gordon did an 8 month investigation on aspartame when he was with UPI\n(on www.dorway.org part one - part two ) also wrote the article \"FDA Resisted Proposals To Test Aspartame\" when he was working with the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 1996. The manufacturers manipulate the FDA into helping them prevent new independent studies, by citing the ostensible \"200 studies that\nshow it is safe.\" Gordon wrote:\n\"Food and Drug Administration officials have for years resisted proposals from government scientists for comprehensive studies on the safety of the artificial sweetener aspartame, which [at least] 100 million Americans consume as NutraSweet. Between the early 1980s and 1994, scientists at the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) proposed at least four times that the government's leading program for toxicology research fund such studies, the Star Tribune has learned. The government scientists said they wanted the National Toxicology Program to conduct animal studies to resolve questions about the sweetener's cancer risks. After each of these \"nominations,\" NIEHS officials elected not to pursue the research at the urging of FDA officials, who said they were satisfied with industry-sponsored research that found no health risks. ...\n\"Now, after a scientific paper by researchers at Washington University of St. Louis has rekindled fears that aspartame may cause deadly brain tumors, some present and former NIEHS officials are criticizing the FDA for using its influence to delay research that could have settled some or all of the safety questions.\"\nPerhaps by now, you can understand why no one in the USA knew that the European Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences Cancer Research Centre in Bologna, Italy was doing a 3-year study on aspartame. No independent researcher would want the manufacturers to know, because they would threaten, try to prevent and harass them. The studies, just recently released, show just exactly what was expected, that aspartame triggers malignant brain tumors as in original studies, lymphoma, leukemia and even kidney cancer and cancer of the peripheral cranial nerves. They called it a multipotential carcinogen, which we've known for 25 years!\nIn the 1970's, G.D. Searle sacrificed people in South and Central America who were in poor villages. They developed brain tumors and seizures; one pregnant woman began to bleed extensively, lost her baby, and disappeared; and otherwise the studies showed aspartame destroys the brain and central nervous system. Aspartame also hardened the synovial fluids accounting for the agonizing joint pain so many victims complain about. Searle did not publish these studies, although we have the affidavit of the translator. They promptly closed the Florida office, went back to Illinois, and sent the physician involved to Mexico.\nNow FDA will just stick with industry and accept the flawed studies instead of the real ones. They're complaining the Italian researchers didn't kill the rats after 2 years but let them live out their lives. This to determine how many cancers the aged rats would develop, just as my files are full of cancer reports from older Americans. The quicker you kill them, the fewer cancers you find!\nStudies in Norway a few years ago showed aspartame destroys the brain, especially in the area of learning. The studies in South and Central America revealed the brain tumors. The manufacturers' own studies in Dr. Olney's office showed aspartame destroys the brain. The manufacturers have been caught red-handed so all they can use is their abundant clout & cash to get regulators to rubber-stamp their poisons. To hell with the people their poisons kill!\nThis letter has been long and detailed; in order for you to know beyond a shadow of a doubt, as FDA toxicologist, Dr. Gross, told Congress, that aspartame is indeed a carcinogen. Dr. H. J. Roberts' medical text, Aspartame Disease: An Ignored Epidemic , is 1038 pages of diseases and horrors that this toxin causes. As an abortifacient and teratogen it has destroyed millions of babies in their mother's womb and caused ADD, Autism, ADHD, Tourette's, mental retardation and a host of other horrors to our children.\nGovernor Richardson, thank you for your courage to get junk food out of school. Please just remember \"no sweeteners,\" as they mostly are all chemicals except for Just Like Sugar (available in Whole Foods) and the sweet herb Stevia. There are products like Xylitol that can cause some bloating but nowhere near as bad as what it is presently in soft drinks. With the information I am giving you in this letter, you and the legislators can strongly stand up to and reject the complaints of the lobbyists for the corporations which include Ajinomoto, Altria Corporate Services (Kraft-Philip Morris), the Glutamate Association of America, Pepsi Cola and Coca Cola, when your excellent legislative efforts in this realm come before the 2006 legislature.\nAttorney General Madrid and Deputy Attorney General Bluestone, please show the same kind of courage in your legal research and your eventual Opinion for the Pharmacy Board, that they can move forward to hear evidence on the neurotoxicity of aspartame in medications, vitamins, and aspirin, despite the fact that this neurodegenerative product technically retains its ill-gotten FDA approval.\nAspartame has caused an epidemic of obesity and diabetes. It also aggravates and simulates diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy and interacts with insulin. It's a drug that makes you crave carbohydrates as Dr. Wurtman has reported. [Please see protest of National Soft Drink Association ]\nA book could be written on what the manufacturers have done! Even in the UPI investigation, it was reported physicians who spoke out to Congress were put on a yacht and the aspartame manufacturers tried to change their mind. No one disagrees they have bottomless checkbooks, but they also intimidate, threaten and have no concern for how many perish on their poison, and this should be prosecuted in due course by racketeering statutes, because purely and simply, racketeering is precisely what they do! If aspartame were safe, consider they would not have to manipulate studies, and try to prevent any independent studies, just as Ajinomoto is trying now to prevent any inquiries about aspartame's neurotoxicity from two New Mexico Boards!\nIn one of the manufacturers' press releases on the new Italian study, they commented that they thought it was criminal that the regulatory people were not advised. In other words, what they are saying is that they had no opportunity to change the results by purchasing the researchers' loyalty! Dr. Blaylock said their study confirmed the previous study by Dr. Trocho and co-workers (1998) that also found the formaldehyde breakdown product of aspartame to be damaging to cellular DNA and that this damage was cumulative. Similarly, when aspartame manufacturers and their front groups like the Calorie Control Council say the recent Italian studies by the Ramazzini Foundation don't go along with other carcinogen studies, they are lying; they are trying to compare the truthful new one from Italy to ones they controlled to get the result they wanted. And the Trocho people were intimidated terribly.\nPlease don't forget Dr. Blaylock's words in Aspartame Makers Tell A Whopper :\n\"This study should terrify mothers and all those consuming aspartame sweetened products. This was a carefully done study that clearly demonstrated a statistically significant increase in several types of lymphomas and leukemias in rats. Both of these malignancies have increased significantly in this country since the widespread use of aspartame.\"\nHe also wrote: \"These studies strongly indicate that drinking a single diet cola sweetened with aspartame everyday could significantly increase one's risk of developing a lymphoma or leukemia.\"\nClearly by statute, the Environmental Improvement Board of New Mexico and the Board of Pharmacy have the power to conduct hearings, examine the evidence, and if they deem appropriate, to then ban aspartame. If they didn't exercise their powers given to them by the legislature in statutes, they would be of no use to the people. This was corroborated by former Special Assistant Attorney General Stevan Looney, now of the Sutin Firm, who represented Petitioner Stephen Fox pro-bono because he knew he was protecting the health of the citizens of New Mexico.\n-----------------------------------------\nWith that being said, I would like to go over the specific arguments from the attorneys who represent the manufacturers who make this toxin poisoning the world.\nI. Ajinomoto's lawyer wrote that he would argue, \"that federal approval of aspartame prevents the Board from outlawing it.\" That's pure poppycock. A precedent was given in the conclusion of the EIB, after hearing extensive medical and even more extensive legal arguments. If you examined further the FDA approval, you would see that it was illegally approved. First of all, it's a drug, and not an additive. An additive BY LAW requires that it be inert, the symptoms and diseases would not be filling a 1038 page medical text , and there wouldn't be 92 documented symptoms on the FDA report. Aspartame is about as inert as Mt. Vesuvius when it erupts!\nAspartame not only failed the adulteration statutes, but also was considered by the National Soft Drink Association to be an adulterant; this is part of the congressional record. Interestingly, the FDA admitted aspartame could not be heated and then gave heed to the wind and approved it for baking. Thus, the soft drink companies WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE sent diet pop laced with this poison to the Persian Gulf to sit in the 120 degree Arabian sun for as long as 8 weeks at a time so the troops could ingest formaldehyde cocktails, one of the major precipitants and causes of the so-called \"Gulf War Syndrome.\"\nAspartame can precipitate MS and ALS or Lou Gehrig's. So when the Government did a study, they found a lot of the troops had Lou Gehrig's. What would you expect? One lady who had an aspartame brain tumor said she was in a support group in Texas that had 70 vets, all with brain tumors. Remember that aspartame interacts with vaccines. They didn't have a chance. Further, the symptoms of Desert Storm Illness are identical to the FDA's report of 92 documented symptoms. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to recognize the truth: that the manufacturers had full knowledge of their crime.\nThe evidence is already piled so high there is no way the manufacturers could win on honest grounds. They left a paper trail like their trade secret information explaining their knowledge. In the last paragraph they said:\n\"With the spoon-for-spoon, we have no way of estimating maximum likely abuse and hence need to utilize data based on almost complete conversion to DKP. If we include this use in the original FAP, we stand a good chance of ending up with nothing in the short run and nothing in the long run, whereas the other approach would give us something in the short run and quite likely as much as we would ever get in the long run.\"\nDKP [diketo-piperazine] is a proven brain tumor-causing agent, so they knew there was almost complete conversion, and a global population would come down with brain tumors. How can the manufacturers even try to fight? The evidence of their many crimes is detailed in numerous government and public domain records.\nII. \"No State Law Delegation to Board.\" Ajinomoto's lawyers say they will argue that the legislature has not given this Board the authority to regulate in this area. Nonsense! They describe the Pharmacy Board's enabling statute as an anti-fraudulent labeling law. This is correct, but that is not all this statute is. If aspartame were labeled correctly, the label would say: \"Genocide: Keep out of reach of humans.\"\nOne woman's life was saved because her daughter, a med student, happened to notice the aspartame in her lab had a skull and crossbones on it. Realizing it was a poison she got her mother off of it and saved her life. Up till that point, she had been away planning her funeral in her hometown.\nIn the background of all of these considerations, there is so much product liability involved a paper could be written on it, perhaps a worthy future endeavor for your Civil Division, Madame Attorney General?\nThe manufacturers label aspartame diet when in fact, it makes you gain weight. It is labeled as an additive instead of drug. It liberates free methyl alcohol, which is against the law, and methanol is classified as a narcotic. The chronic methanol poisoning is what affects the dopamine system of the brain and causes the addiction as discussed in Dr. Roberts's medical text. Can you imagine, our children being given a narcotic and a neurodegenerative metabolite like formaldehyde in their vitamins, aspirin, prescription drugs and food? If someone in the New Mexico Attorney General's staff or in a private New Mexico Plaintiff's firm wanted to investigate product liability and fraud, aspartame fits every definition perfectly.\nIII. The attorneys speak of the Board's Discretionary Right to Refrain from Proceeding saying \"even if the Board were to conclude it has the power, it can refrain from doing anything.\"\nPerhaps they threw that in to in essence ask, \"Why be bothered?\"\nWhy be bothered? To stop the people of New Mexico from being poisoned! Ajinomoto's lawyers maintain that the Board lacks the expertise of the FDA, which approved aspartame. In the beginning, over 16 years from 1966 to 1981, the FDA did not approve aspartame; it declined the petition for approval. Since no FDA Commissioner would allow it on the market for 16 years, Donald Rumsfeld, at that point President of G.D. Searle, the aspartame patent holder, had to get Reagan to appoint an FDA Commissioner who would over-rule the Board of Inquiry. That man was Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes, and Reagan was so concerned he actually wrote an executive order to make the current FDA Commissioner powerless to do anything about aspartame until he could get Hayes there to do his deadly deed!\nThe rest of Ajinomoto's argument is more babble because they really have nothing to say in its defense which legally viable. The Board does not lack the resources to address the issue. The Board has access to physicians and experts to bring them the evidence, and plenty will testify to counter what we anticipate from the corporate \"rental\" physicians, pediatricians, and toxicologists. We have most of the documents and studies.\nAnd then Ajinomoto's lawyer's foolish statement: \"The two distinct pending requests - relating to aspartame and mercury - may not be the only ones filed. If the Board entertains these, others could follow.\" So what is their point here? If there are other poisons, they should follow. Any person of integrity would not want citizens to be destroyed by poisons. That's why New Mexico has an Environmental Improvement Board and a Board of Pharmacy.\nNext, Ajinomoto's lawyer says that \"if the Board decides to proceed, it first may need to adopt rules of substance and procedure governing this process.\" We agree, of course, since the lives and health of the citizens of New Mexico are important enough to put exacting efforts into delineating effective rules of substance and procedure.\nIf the rules of substance and procedure are seen to be substantially spelled out and delineated in the New Mexico statutes in the sections of the Drug Act concerning adulteration, mislabeling, and other concerns, surely you as Governor and you as Attorney General might accept that the Pharmacy Board with 6 pharmacists on it, can easily determine appropriate rules of substance and procedure on its own, and not facilely or sloppily accept the corporate-substituted procedures prepared by Ajinomoto's lawyers.\nNext, the Ajinomoto lawyer asks:\n\"A. Substance - What must be proven to outlaw or permit aspartame? What level of risk of harm must be established for the petitioner to prevail? Who has the burden of proof? Is it relevant that aspartame has health benefits such as combating obesity?\"\nWow! Did the manufacturers' attorneys do any research at all? Perhaps they are making it up as they go along because they don't know what to say? What beyond the following must be proven to outlaw aspartame?\n1. It's an illegal deadly neurotoxic drug masquerading as an additive. This has already been proven with over 20 years of use, using the public as guinea pigs, with incontrovertible and almost incalculable neurodegenerative damage to millions.\n2. Level of harm? Aspartame has destroyed millions of people; there is an Aspartame Toxicity Center recording the cases; there are Aspartame Detoxification Centers caring for the victims in many cities; there are many medical texts documenting the mechanism by which is disables and kills; and finally, there are operations and citizens' groups in every state and over 30 countries just warning the people not to use it or have their health destroyed or even lose their life, all acting pro bono! How could such operations even exist if aspartame were as safe as Ajinomoto would have you naively believe?\nAjinomoto's lawyers ask the question about possible health benefits of aspartame? Hogwash! There is no health benefit to consuming poison. According to Neurosurgeon Russell Blaylock, aspartame actually damages the cardiac conduction system and causes sudden death: http://www.rense.com/general67/alert.htm\nFurther, as Dr. Blaylock says in a lecture on www.mpwhi.com/main.htm :\n\"Understand the reactions to aspartame are not allergic but toxic like arsenic and cyanide.\" If physicians can't find a health benefit for cyanide, they certainly won't find one for aspartame.\nB. Ajinomoto Attorneys ask: \"Procedure - What weight is given to the federal determination? Is it enough that the Board merely disagrees with FDA, or must it find the FDA determination is 'clearly erroneous' or the product of fraud, collusion or undue influence? Is the entire federal record to be admitted? Are exhibits exchanged in advance? Is expert testimony required? Who is an expert?\"\nThis perhaps is a kind of corporate lawyer's fishing expedition. All the evidence and exhibits are available. There is so much expert testimony, physicians and scientists could give the facts continuously for all 5 days in the July 2006 EIB hearings. How about as experts the very physicians who have been treating aspartame victims for two decades in the trenches of medical practice, like Dr. H.J. Roberts, Dr. Ralph Walton, and Dr. Russell\nBlaylock?\nC. Aspartame v. Mercury - \"Are there to be two different sets of rules and two different standards for aspartame, which has affirmative federal approval and for mercury, which may not have such approval.\"\nObviously what the Board is concerned with is evidence they are poisons and that evidence is available. The rule change and additional chapter to the New Mexico Administrative Code being considered by the Board of Pharmacy is on the subject of neurotoxic additives to medications and vaccines, the worst of which are aspartame/formaldehyde and thimerosal/mercury.\n\"V. No Need to Proceed Now.\"\nThey must have thrown that in because they ran out of things to say!\nA. Petitioners could take their evidence to FDA. \"They claim aspartame violates federal standards, notwithstanding federal approval.\"\nThey really ought to know better than to say something this stupid. Physicians and scientists have been screaming at the FDA, giving them the proof, and filing Citizens Petitions for banning for years. They know the FDA operates above the law and ignores this. In fact, I filed a Citizens' Petition for banning aspartame, based on the fact their records show aspartame to be a chemical poison and that they lied to the public, and continue to lie to the public.\nThe law requires they answer in 180 days. It will be 4 years in June! The FDA refuses to operate within the law and answer this petition. One of the reasons is I listed the lies found within the government records is that the only way they can answer the petition and my citations of all of the FDA and industry lies is for the FDA to honestly remove aspartame from the market. So the FDA just ignores it. They wrote back to me they had more important things to do!\n\"B. Some of the issues in this matter might be resolved in the New Mexico EIB proceedings and possible related judicial proceedings.\"\nAjinomoto's lawyer threw this in to raise the possibility to the Board of Pharmacy that they will bring an action in state or federal court similar to the action brought by the very same lawyer (Richard Minzner) against the New Mexico EIB for trying to create and implement stronger safety standards to protect workers from acts of violence in convenience stores. This is obviously a not so subtle form of intimidation by the same lawyer with a different client of a second New Mexico Board, the Board of Pharmacy.\nYes, these issues might be and will be resolved when aspartame is banned. The manufacturers are scared to death because when aspartame is banned people will wake up well from all kinds of health problems they have been suffering from. When my organization, Mission Possible International, prepared 16,000 Killer Kola brochures on aspartame which were given out freely from an organic market in Atlanta with the medical evidence on this neurotoxin some years ago, thousands abstained, and about 60 days later, people came into the store exclaiming that all kinds of health problems had disappeared. Seizures stopped; those crippled from Multiple Sclerotic symptoms walked again; headaches disappeared; and dozens of symptoms vanished. The manufacturers know if aspartame is banned in New Mexico, there will emerge a kind of prima facie evidence for their absolute complicity in these neuro-degenerative problems, and, as well, of their massive product liability.\nBelow is the letter written to the EIB Board on how aspartame violates state and federal adulteration statutes. These violations alone are enough to ban it from New Mexico in food products.\nPlease stand strong and don't be intimidated! You can set a precedent for the world to follow, and thus go down in history as having saved the lives of millions of people!\nIf you really want to see many more of the really egregious facts in evidence, please watch the movie Sweet Misery: A Poisoned World . Observe the interview with Diane Fleming, a Sunday school teacher whose husband, a basketball athlete and heavy user of aspartame, died from the methanol poisoning. They thought she poisoned him, even though she took a lie detector test and passed, and the detective involved in the investigation said there was no way she could have poisoned him. She was the one who called the police. She was sentenced to 20 and 30 years concurrently and lingers in a cold prison cell in Virginia because the manufacturers of aspartame murdered her husband. Doctors' affidavits say Charles Fleming died from aspartame. Yet another victim from this neurodegenerative artificial sweetener, perhaps the cruelest story of them all!\nFree the citizens of New Mexico from this deadly poison!\nRespectfully,\nDr. Betty Martini, Founder, Mission Possible International, 9270 River Club\nParkway, Duluth, Georgia 30097 770 242-2599\n"}, {"score": 1139.0458, "uuid": "47731576-8f22-55d2-8997-49725749247b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0709wb-24-12123", "target_hostname": "www.westonaprice.org", "target_uri": "http://www.westonaprice.org/beginner-videos/natural-sweeteners-video-by-sarah-pope", "page_rank": 1.1839987e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Natural <em>Sweeteners</em> Video by Sarah Pope - Weston A Price Foundation", "snippet": "Avoiding processed <em>sugar</em> through use of <em>artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em> is even more damaging to health as consumption of artificially sweetened foods appears to increase the odds of overweight by triggering overeating.

She also blogs as The Healthy Home Economist .\nTranscript: Natural Sweeteners\nBy Sarah Pope\nOpening Segment\nRefined sweeteners such as sugar and high fructose corn syrup are a true villain of health, stealing away vitality and adding pounds to one\u2019s backside in short order.\nThese displacing foods of modern commerce as described by Dr. Weston A. Price not only contain large amounts of refined sweeteners syrup but also contain little to no nutrition to compensate for these empty calories.\nAvoiding processed sugar through use of artificial sweeteners is even more damaging to health as consumption of artificially sweetened foods appears to increase the odds of overweight by triggering overeating. And just as with sugar, artificial sweeteners can be addictive.\nSweets need not be avoided completely, however. It is possible to be healthy and still satisfy the natural and instinctive desire for sweet things with homemade desserts that are both nutritious and delicious.\nThe key is to use only whole, unprocessed sweeteners.\nSince individual reactions to even natural sweeteners vary widely, it is a good idea to test your pulse before and after eating different ones. An increased pulse of more than a few beats per minute likely indicates a reaction\nThe key to eating sweets safely once you have determined which whole sweeteners suit you best is to always consume them in the presence of fat --whether that be cream on fruit, egg yolks in custards, or butter and eggs in cakes, cookies, puddings and pies. Fat consumed with sugar in any form greatly slows down the blood sugar rise from absorption of the sugar into the bloodstream\nIt is also a good idea to limit desserts to special occasions and one or two nights a week after dinner only. Keeping sweets accessible around the house, even if homemade, is too tempting for most people, especially children.\nLet\u2019s spend a few minutes identifying which sweeteners can be considered truly natural - meaning no original nutrients have been removed:\nMaple Syrup\nMaple syrup is rich in trace minerals and imparts wonderful flavor to baked goods, cream-based desserts and of course, pancakes and waffles.\nBe sure to seek out Grade B maple syrup, which is darker and richer in minerals and flavor than Grade A maple syrup. Grade B is also sometimes less expensive than Grade A.\n\u201cB\u201d stands for \u201cBetter\u201d when it comes to maple syrup!\nMaple Sugar\nMaple sugar is dehydrated maple syrup. It has a delicate flavor and good chemical properties. However, it is very expensive, and usually must be purchased on the Internet.\nSucanat\nSucanat is the best substitute for white or brown sugar in your recipes for cookies and cakes. It is simply dehydrated cane sugar juice and has been used for thousands of year by the people of India.\nSucanat is widely available in healthfood stores and through bulk co-ops for maximum savings. I typically split a 50 lb bag of sucanat with a friend and this easily lasts my family a year or two. It stores without spoiling in the garage in a 5 lb bucket with a tight fitting lid.\nBe careful not to overdo on the sucanat as eating too much can upset blood chemistry very much like white sugar. Also, don\u2019t buy turbinado or other sugars labeled as raw as the nutrients have still been removed from these products. In a pinch, turbinado sugar can be used with small amounts of molasses added back in.\nMolasses\nMy Grandmother\u2019s molasses cookie recipe is one of my children\u2019s all time favorites! A beneficial byproduct from the production of white sugar, molasses has a very strong taste and contains many minerals including iron, calcium, zinc, copper, and especially chromium which is important for the maintenance of healthy blood sugar levels.\nMolasses is delicious stirred into a glass of whole, raw milk. Instead of iron supplements, I took it straight off the spoon almost daily during the last trimester of my pregnancies to help maintain optimal iron levels.\nMalted Grain Syrups\nMalted Syrups, usually made with barley, have been used for thousands of years particularly in Asia. While malted syrups do not contain much in the way of nutritional value, they offer a real alternative to other sweeteners in that they contain very little fructose which is harmful in large amounts .\nIf you have a compromised gut environment, the following whole sweeteners may prove to be even better choices due to their ability to be fully absorbed even when the digestion is imbalanced:\nRaw Honey\nSeek raw honey from local producers if possible as it can prove beneficial for thwarting seasonal allergies. Raw honey is loaded with beneficial digestive enzymes that are destroyed by heating above 117 degrees F so be sure to use in desserts that do not require heating.\nDo not give honey to infants, however, as young babies are not equipped with sufficient stomach acid to tolerate honey in its raw state.\nStevia\nStevia is a sweet powder made from a South American herb that can be used even by people who are sensitive to other whole sweeteners.\nStevia is many times sweeter than sugar, so just a pinch is all that is needed to replace an entire spoonful. Stevia does not work very well in baked goods but it is an excellent sweetener in salad dressings, smoothies, whipped cream, puddings, and pie crusts.\nTake care to find green stevia powder, which is the unprocessed whole form of stevia leaf unlike the processed white stevia powders and stevia liquids that are popular in healthfood stores.\nDate Sugar\nDate sugar is made from dehydrated dates and contains the amino acid tryptophan which has a calming effect, making it a good choice for sweets made for hyperactive children.\nDate sugar does not dissolve well and so is not as suitable for cookies and cakes but goes very well with breakfast porridges and cream-based desserts where a little crunchy texture is delightful.\nCoconut Sugar and Coconut Nectar\nA newly discovered sweetener on the market is coconut sugar and coconut nectar. These low glycemic sweeteners are the ideal alternative to agave nectar which has become very popular in alternative health circles but is actually a highly processed sweetener manufactured in a manner similar to high fructose corn syrup.\nCoconut nectar in particular is similar in texture to malted grain syrups and can be used in place of maple syrup on pancakes and waffles.\nClosing Segment\nI hope you\u2019ve found this catalogue of whole sweet foods helpful in navigating the minefield of sweeteners on the market today. By sticking with traditional, whole sweeteners and limiting consumption to only a few days each week, you can satisfy that inborn sweet tooth and still maintain vibrant health.\nBe sure to order the Shopping Guide from the Weston A. Price Foundation to find a complete list of healthy sweeteners and where to order them.\nThis is Sarah, TheHealthyHomeEconomist blogger and Weston A. Price Chapter Leader.

Fatigue is usually the first to set in and is seen especially when a person fasts, this can interfere with daily activities. Carbohydrates are your body\u2019s first choice for fuel. A low carbohydrate diet may seem healthy, but if taken to the extreme it is very dangerous and can affect brain function. Remember, if you choose a low carbohydrate diet, it means LOW in carbohydrates, not NO carbohydrates.\nWhat about calorie-free or low-calorie sweeteners?\nThe best choices for sweet foods are foods with complex carbohydrates, plant-based foods that contain fiber in them. Fruits. \u00a0Personally, when I bake, I would rather use the right amount of sugar and then only eat one rather than eating the entire batch, it is all about self-control. The biggest concern with artificial sweeteners is that they have not been out on the market very long for scientists to be able to study the long-term affects to your bodies. The other issue is that the studies that have been performed contain a lot of biased because the company making the product employs the scientists that study the product. With that said, here are a few low-calorie sweeteners options. I do not promote these, but they are very popular and clients deserve to be given the option.\nSweetLeaf Sweetener and Truvia\nBoth of these products are made from the stevia herb. SweetLeaf contains only stevia and Truvia contains stevia and a sugar alcohol. These both contain zero calories and according to their websites can be used for baking. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has deemed stevia safe in moderate amounts and is now added to many different beverage options. PepsiCo as developed its own version known as PureVia.\nWhey Low\nThis is a blend of fructose, sucrose and lactose and completely absorbed in the body. Since the body can absorb this product it has 5 calories/teaspoon. Many repost using Whey Low and substitution in baking works well, but be sure to go their website for the ratio and the change in oven temperature. There is no statement by the FDA, and according to their website there are no side effects observed in testing performed to date.\nXylitol\nThis is a natural sugar alcohol found in a few different foods; the human body also naturally produces it during digestion. Xylitol tastes sweet like sugar, but had 40% less calories than sugar. It is absorbed slowly, which in turn does not stimulate insulin or an increase in blood sugar. The FDA deemed xylitol safe for human digestion in 1986, however, in large amounts xylitol could result in abdominal discomfort, gas and diarrhea.\nAgave Nectar\nAgave is produced from desert plants and is a liquid sweetener that actually contains more calories than sugar, 20 calories/teaspoon compared to 15 calories/teaspoon for sugar. However, agave is so sweet that much less is needed to reach the same sweetness as sugar. Agave is mainly used in making beverages and is considered safe for consumption in moderate amounts, but some experts state that pregnant women should use with caution because it may contain steroids that could lead to a miscarriage. The high-fructose content of agave nectar is of some concern as people believe an increased consumption of fructose is to blame for part of America\u2019s obesity epidemic.\nWhat about the sweeteners you see are on every restaurant table?\nThese sweeteners are found is a lot of foods: soda, yogurt and even some breakfast cereals.

They taste good. They dissolve well and you can bake with them,\" she said. The samples she put out at her office have received good reviews.\nYet, Marian Nestle, food studies and public health professor at New York University, is cautious about any type of sugar substitute.\n\"Sugar is not a poison,\" she says. \"It's an issue of quantity. I like sugar.\"\nWhile she is not convinced there is a health concern with the artificial sweeteners, she doesn't think they taste good, and she says that studies have shown there is no evidence that they help people lose weight.\n\"There's an almost one-to-one correlation between use of artificial sweeteners and obesity. They don't prevent obesity,\" Nestle said. \"People just eat more.\"\nStill, with Americans consuming an average of 20 teaspoons of sugar a day (the amount in two 12-ounce sodas) by USDA estimates, and many consuming far more, manufacturers have found there is a market for a natural, low-calorie sugar substitute.\n\"We're seeing an incredibly dynamic set of circumstances in the market,\" Steven Silbert, of Sunwin Stevia, which produces OnlySweet, said in an interview last year. \"Sales of diet sodas are down because people are concerned about things like aspartame and sucralose,\" he said. \"They're looking for something more natural.\"\nSweetFiber president Scott Taylor says more people are becoming \"sensitized to the value of natural foods.\"\nBut manufacturers are divided, he says, on whether consumers will pay more for all-natural sweeteners or opt for the cheaper synthetics.\nThat was not an issue when White Dog Cafe began using stevia for coffee and tea service five years ago.\n\"We stopped carrying the synthetic/chemical sweeteners,\" said owner Judy Wicks.\n\"Stevia is all-natural and actually good for you because it has vitamins and minerals.\"\nMore incentive for change: Refined white sugar has no nutritive value beyond energy and has been linked to some degenerative diseases.\nThe new sweeteners create a new color palette of packets, including orange (Z Sweet), brown (Sweet Simplicity), purple (NuStevia), green (SweetFiber), and bigger yellow (Organic Zero).\nAmong the new offerings, several use sugar alcohols or extracts from fruits and other foods that the FDA qualifies as GRAS (\"generally recognized as safe\"). They include:\nErythritol\nA natural sugar alcohol, erythritol (ee-RITH-ri-tol) is found in fruits and fermented foods. It is 60 to 70 percent as sweet as sugar, with a lighter, cooler taste and almost no calories. Absorbed mostly in the small intestine, it rarely causes gastric distress (laxative effect, gas or bloating) as noted with other sugar alcohols such as xylitol, maltitol or sorbitol, unless used in excess.\nFor baking, erythritol has some of sugar's tenderizing effect and can partially replace sugar for most uses, especially in combination with chocolate, where artificial sweeteners don't cut it.\nIt is used in several new sweeteners, among them:\nZ Sweet. A blend of erythritol and natural flavors in orange packets (zero calories and kosher parve). A near-perfect match for sugar's sweetness and mouthfeel. The fine crystals have a pleasant, faintly fruity undertone.\nAn 8.8-ounce canister is $9.49; a 1.5-pound pouch, $13.39, at Whole Foods. Boxes of 100 packets are 3 for $25 at www.zsweetstore.com .\nOrganic Zero. Organic erythritol produced by fermenting organic sugar-cane juice puts this close to sugar, but the slightly larger crystals have a lighter (less sweet), \"cool\" taste. For some that's fine; others may want to use 25 to 30 percent more.\nOrganic Zero comes in a 35-packet (6.2-ounce) box, $8.69, or 12-ounce pouch, $12.49, at Whole Foods.\nSweet Simplicity\u0099. An all-natural blend of about five parts erythritol (derived from corn) to one part fructose with a proprietary blend of natural flavors. Legally labeled \"zero calorie\" (fewer than five calories per serving), the fructose in the mix gives Sweet Simplicity\u0099 an actual count just over four calories per serving. It can substitute one-to-one for sugar in baking. (Kosher parve.) In packets (brown), a 6.4-ounce, 30-count box is $8.69; a 1.75-pound (28-ounce) canister, $12.99, at Whole Foods.\nLuo han guo\nA fruit extract from southern China, luo han guo has a long history of use in Chinese herbal medicine for teas to treat coughs and sore throat and to aid longevity. Though too perishable to transport fresh, the dried fruit has been used here for much of the past century. In 1995, Procter & Gamble patented a process to isolate its sweet flavors as a sugar substitute for manufacturing and home kitchens.\nSweet Fiber. This powdery addition to the sweet sweeps pairs luo han guo with inulin, a mildly sweet natural vegetable fiber from chicory root, to add bulk and dietary fiber. It tends to clump when moistened and is slightly slower to dissolve. A rare sugar substitute with added benefit, it offers 10 percent of the recommended daily 25 to 30 grams fiber.\nA 1.75-ounce, 50-packet box is $7.79 at Martindale's Natural Market, 1172 Baltimore Pike, Springfield, Delaware County (610-543-4946) Also at www.sweetfiber.net .\nStevia\nDerived from the shrub Stevia rebaudiana, stevia has been used as a sweetener by natives in Paraguy and Brazil for centuries and has been the chief noncaloric sweetener in Japan for more than 30 years. The refined extract (a white powder called steviosides) is 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar, with a slightly bitter aftertaste similar to licorice that is masked by blending.\nThough FDA guidelines allow GRAS status to any natural substance used prior to 1958 with no reported adverse effects, the agency has denied that status to stevia, even though there have been no negative reports.\nBy public demand, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) passed in 1994 allowing use of some natural products, including stevia, as dietary supplements. Now, under FDA guidelines, stevia can be sold as a \"dietary supplement,\" but call it a sweetener or flavoring and it becomes an \"unsafe food additive\" subject to confiscation and destruction. Absent such labeling, stevia is available in drinks and as an ingredient such as:\nNuStevia. A naturally debittered white stevia powder mixed with maltodextrin, a food-grade carbohydrate derived from corn, and natural flavors. In purple packets, it has been the sweetener of choice at White Dog Cafe for about nine months, replacing an earlier version used for four years. It is sold in 50-, 100- and 1000-packet boxes at health food stores and online. A 100-packet box runs from $5.99 to $9.99 depending on the source.\nOnlySweet. A stevia blend with maltodextrin and a proprietary flavoring agent to mask any aftertaste. It is sold in Albertsons, Kroger and other mainstream markets. A 100-packet box is $8.59; 200-count box, $14.95.\nFive artificial sweeteners have FDA approval\nFive artificial sweeteners are approved by the FDA as food additives: sucralose, saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), and neotame.\nEach has faced concerns about potential health risks, yet extensive research and peer-reviewed studies have consistently failed to show clear evidence of adverse effects.\nThose low- to no-cal sweeteners are the most thoroughly tested ingredients in our food supply, and hundreds of studies show them to be safe, says dietitian Beth Hubrich, associate director and spokesperson for the Calorie Control Council, a trade group.\nStill, many believe that artificial sweeteners, especially if blended together, contribute to a growing pattern of obesity, sleep disorders, sexual dysfunction, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and other epidemic degenerative diseases in the United States.\nAlso, sugar substitutes do not offer the bulk, tenderness and browning properties of sugar, although some blends perform better than others.\nHere's an overview:\nSucralose. Sold by McNeil Nutritionals in Fort Washington as Splenda, this is a compound synthesized by adding three chlorine atoms found naturally in foods to a molecule of sucrose (cane sugar). It is 600 times sweeter than the starter sugar, which is vaporized in the process. The change in structure makes it an organochloride, some of which have adverse health effects in small doses. That led critics to call for more testing and left some with lingering doubts about its safety.\nBlended with dextrose and maltodextrin for bulk (at 1.66 calories per teaspoon), it was introduced as Splenda in 1999 and by 2006 had garnered a 62 percent market share due in part to advertising it as \"made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar.\" Though technically and grammatically correct, the arguably misleading statement ticked off competitors and brought lawsuits from both sides: Merisant (makers of Equal) and the Sugar Association.\nThe McNeil-Merisant dispute peaked last year in U.S. District Court here, when the firms reached an undisclosed settlement. It was not their first, nor their last, legal wrangle.\nMeanwhile, the public loves Splenda, which is heat-stable and can be used in baking. It's widely available in granulated, minis (tablets), flavors, and, for baking, in a 50/50 blend of sucralose and sugar (white or brown). A 9.7-ounce pouch of granulated Splenda, (comparable to five pounds of sugar), costs about $7.50.\nSaccharin. (Sweet'N Low, SugarTwin)\nSynthesized in 1879, saccharin was the first artificial sweetener. It is used in diet foods and beverages and in products such as toothpaste. A bitter aftertaste is masked by blending other sweeteners.\nConcerns about its safety grew after a study found an increased rate of bladder cancer in laboratory rats fed doses comparable to hundreds of diet sodas a day. The FDA nearly banned it in 1977, but public demand led to congressional intervention, a warning label and more tests.\nIn 2000, the warning was lifted, saccharin was taken off the carcinogen list, and its use in beverages and some processed foods was reapproved. Some view saccharin, initially developed from a complex plant sugar extract, as the safest artificial sweetener. Widely available, a box of 400 packets is $5.37 at Sams Club or samsclub.com.\nAspartame. (Equal, NutraSweet, Sugar Twin) Contains two amino acids, phenylalanine and aspartic acid, found in protein foods. (Not for use by those with the rare metabolic disease phenylketonuria or PKU, which limits consumption of protein foods.)\nApproved in 1981, it is metabolized to fewer than three calories per packet with the sweetening effect of two teaspoons sugar. It is affected by heat, thus not recommended for cooking. Available plain or flavored (also blended as Equal Sugar Lite), it is priced from less than $4 per 100 single-serving packets to about $10 for a 1-pound bag.\nAcesulfame potassium (Ace-K). (Sunett, Sweet One)\nApproved for use in 90 countries and included in more than 4000 foods and beverages, notably carbonated drinks. It is often blended with sucralose or aspartame for a sweeter, a more sugarlike taste (each masks the other's aftertaste). Unlike aspartame, acesulfame potassium is stable to 400 degrees, even under acidic or basic conditions. It is not metabolized, adds no calories, and is excreted unchanged.\nNeotame. A super-sweetener (8,000 times sweeter than sugar), this aspartame sibling also contains aspartic acid and phenylalanine, but is metabolized differently - thus no PKU warning is required. Approved in 2002, it has yet to come into use. As only trace amounts are needed, manufacturers' costs could be cut nearly in half. Use as a tabletop product and packaged food ingredient is expected.\n- Marilynn Marter\n"}, {"score": 1120.9172, "uuid": "ff6f33ae-c943-53bd-9feb-f0659e7ebd6b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0102wb-99-17934", "target_hostname": "www.caloriecontrol.org", "target_uri": "http://www.caloriecontrol.org/category/topic/low-calorie-sweeteners", "page_rank": 1.1919289e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Low Calorie <em>Sweeteners</em> | The Calorie Control Council", "snippet": "+ What the Experts Say about <em>Artificial</em> <em>Sweeteners</em> + Research: People using <em>sugar</em> free foods to be more aware of diet and nutrition + Dieters Using Low Calorie <em>Sweeteners</em> Have <em>Better</em> Chance of Reaching Goals Madeleine Sigman-Grant: reduced calorie foods and impact on diet awareness + Reducing Calories", "explanation": null, "document": "Copyright \u00a9\nCalorie Control Council.

For example, a product containing 15 g of sugar has 60 calories from sugar per serving.\nKeep in mind that if the product has no fruit or milk products in the ingredients, all of the sugars in the food are from added sugars.

Added sugars contribute additional calories and zero nutrients to food.\nOver the past 30 years, Americans have steadily consumed more and more added sugars in their diets, which has contributed to the obesity epidemic. Reducing the amount of added sugars we eat cuts calories and can help you improve your heart health and control your weight.\nThe American Heart Association recommends limiting the amount of added sugars you consume to no more than half of your daily discretionary calorie allowance. For most American women, this is no more than 100 calories per day and no more than 150 calories per day for men (or about 6 teaspoons per day for women and 9 teaspoons per day for men).\nBack to top\nDiscretionary calories and added sugars\nYou have a daily energy need \u2014 the amount of calories (or energy units) your body needs to function and provide energy for your activities. Think of your daily energy need as a budget. You\u2019d organize a real budget with \u201cessentials\u201d (things like rent and utilities) and \u201cextras\u201d (such as vacation and entertainment). In a daily calorie budget, the essentials are the minimum number of calories you need to meet your nutrient needs.\nSelect low-fat and no-sugar-added foods to make good \u201cnutrient buys\u201d with your budget. Depending on the foods you choose and the amount of physical activity you do each day, you may have calories left over for \u201cextras\u201d that can be used on treats like solid fats, added sugars and alcohol. These are discretionary calories, or calories to be spent at your discretion.\nA person\u2019s discretionary calorie budget varies depending on how physically active they are and how many calories they need to consume to meet their daily nutrient requirements. Use this interactive tool to calculate your personal daily calorie needs. The American Heart Association recommends that no more than half of a person\u2019s daily discretionary calorie allowance be spent on added sugars.\nCommon sources of discretionary calories (in addition to added sugars) are fats, oils and alcohol. Fats are the most concentrated source of calories. Discretionary calories can be used to:\nEat additional foods from a food group above your daily recommendation.\nSelect a higher-calorie form of a food that\u2019s higher in fat or contains added sugars (whole milk vs. skim or sweetened vs. unsweetened cereal).\nAdd fats or sweeteners to the leanest versions of foods (for example, sauce, dressing and butter/margarine).\nEat or drink items that are mostly fat, sugar or alcohol such as candy, cake, beer, wine or regular soda.\nBack to top\nTips for getting less added sugar\nMost Americans consume more than double the daily recommended amount of added sugars. A report from the 2001-04 NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) database showed that Americans get about 22.2 teaspoons of sugar a day or about 355 calories. This is well over the recommended amount of no more than 100 calories per day for women and no more than 150 calories per day for men.\nUse these simple tips to reduce sugar in your diet:\nRemove sugar (white and brown), syrup, honey and molasses from the table \u2014 out of sight, out of mind!\nCut back on the amount of sugar added to things you eat or drink regularly like cereal, pancake, coffee or tea. Try cutting the usual amount of sugar you add by half and wean down from there, or consider using an artificial sweetener.\nBuy sugar-free or low-calorie beverages.\nBuy fresh fruits or fruits canned in water or natural juice. Avoid fruit canned in syrup, especially heavy syrup.\nInstead of adding sugar to cereal or oatmeal, add fresh fruit (try bananas, cherries or strawberries) or dried fruit (raisins, cranberries or apricots).\nWhen baking cookies, brownies or cakes, cut the sugar called for in your recipe by one-third to one-half. Often you won\u2019t notice the difference.\nInstead of adding sugar in recipes, use extracts such as almond, vanilla, orange or lemon.\nEnhance foods with spices instead of sugar; try ginger, allspice, cinnamon or nutmeg.\nSubstitute unsweetened applesauce for sugar in recipes (use equal amounts).\nTry zero-calorie sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose or saccharin in moderation.\n"}, {"score": 1091.4749, "uuid": "3c231191-d667-5096-8182-aa7df5885265", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0600wb-79-11787", "target_hostname": "www.foodprocessing.com", "target_uri": "http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2007/077.html", "page_rank": 1.1832275e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Ingredients &amp; Formultation | Ingredient Round-Up: <em>Sweeteners</em> | Food Processing", "snippet": "This new, natural, low glycemic <em>sugar</em> substitute is four times sweeter <em>than</em> table <em>sugar</em> and is safe for diabetics.

Hill, Ph.D., University of Colorado Health Sciences Center\nSummary\nObesity is a serious, but preventable, U.S. health problem. Diet and lack of physical activity are the two most important controllable factors behind the alarming increase in overweight and obesity. While there is little disagreement over the importance of physical activity in weight loss and weight maintenance, there is a lack of consensus regarding diet. Theories abound as to which dietary component most contributes to weight gain. One popular theory indicts sugar and points to foods with a high-glycemic index. However, the theory that dietary sugar equals high insulin levels equals excess fat deposits is unproven and makes little biological sense. In fact, sugar has a glycemic index similar to most starches. The bottom line is that sugar and sugary foods do not promote weight gain when they are eaten in amounts that do not exceed calorie needs. Neither do they contribute to the development of diabetes. Experts now agree that sugar is not uniquely problematic, even for diabetics. The fact remains that weight management is still an issue of positive energy balance\u00e2\u0080\u0094too many calories, consumed from any source, and not enough burned off results in weight gain. A high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet coupled with regular physical activity remains the best advice for weight loss and weight maintenance, as well as for overall good health.\nForeward\nThe purpose of this paper is to address the role of carbohydrates, especially sugar, in weight management.\nIntroduction\nObesity is a serious health problem in the United States, having reached epidemic proportions. It now ranks second only to smoking as the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of hypertension, elevated cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and respiratory problems as well as endometrial, breast, prostate and colon cancers.\nThe recently concluded third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) found that the majority (55%) of adults in the U.S. are overweight and many (22%) are obese, amounting to an estimated 97 million adults. There has been an especially large increase in obesity over the last 20 years. Most disturbing is the increase in the incidence of overweight among children. NHANES III found a higher proportion of overweight children than in previous surveys.\nOverweight in adults is generally defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0 to 29.9 and obesity as a BMI of 30.0 or greater. (BMI is a measurement of body fat relative to height, and is closely related to a person\u2019s total body fat.) As the BMI increases over 30.0, the related health risks rise. A BMI of 35.0 or greater reflects morbid obesity and is clearly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other obesity- associated conditions. For children, many researchers believe that concern about overweight should begin at the 85th age-specific percentile of BMI. Using this standard, about 25% of children in the U.S. are considered overweight. About 30% of children who are obese become obese adults. And an obese child who becomes an obese adult is likely to have more severe adult obesity than adults whose obesity begins in adulthood. Because obesity is defined as excess body fat, BMI technically defines overweight and not obesity. However, the two terms are often used interchangeably.\nAlthough obesity has a clear genetic component, the country\u2019s gene pool has remained essentially unchanged in the last few decades, pointing to environmental and behavioral factors as being the largest contributors to the growing problem. Diet and lack of regular sustained physical activity are the two most likely candidates. However, the most heated dietary debate is over the role diet composition (particularly fat and carbohydrate) plays in weight management.\nOn one side of the argument are experts who say excess calories, regardless of source, are the culprits. Others, however, point to excess calories from fat or carbohydrates, particularly sugar, as being responsible for weight gain. But while few studies have made distinctions among the different kinds of carbohydrates, several studies have found a strong relationship between excess fat intake and obesity. However, not everyone agrees that fat plays such a pivotal role.\nOne factor, for which there is virtually unanimous agreement is physical activity. An increase in routine physical activity is an important component of weight loss and an even more critical factor in long-term weight maintenance.\nAdult Body Mass Index\n[missing graph]\nHealth risk based solely on BMI: dark gray = moderate to extremely high, light gray = low, white = minimal\nCarbohydrate Basics\nCarbohydrates can be divided into three main groups, sugars (monosaccharides, disaccharides and polyols), oligosaccharides (maltooligosaccharides and other oligosaccharides) and polysaccharides (starch and nonstarch polysaccharides such as cellulose and pectin). \u201cSugars\u201d typically refer to monosaccharides (a sugar such as glucose or fructose that can not be broken down to a simpler form) and disaccharides (sugars, such as sucrose\u00e2\u0080\u0094table sugar\u00e2\u0080\u0094that can be broken down into two monosaccharides). Glucose, fructose and sucrose are found naturally in fruits and vegetables. Sucrose, or table sugar, the disaccharide most commonly consumed by vegetarians and nonvegetarians alike, is made up of both glucose and fructose. Lactose, the sugar found in milk and dairy products, is the other most commonly consumed disaccharide.\nStarch is the primary polysaccharide of plants and the most abundant carbohydrate found in food. The term \u201ccomplex carbohydrates\u201d was coined as a nutritional concept to signify both starches and dietary fibers. Insoluble fibers such as cellulose and hemicellulose, which are found in vegetables and whole grains, form the cell walls of plants. They bind water, increase fecal bulk and speed the passage of food through the digestive tract. Water-soluble fibers, such as pectin and beta-glucan, swell in water to form viscous, gel-like substances that slow absorption through the wall of the small intestine. Most soluble fibers are fermented to some degree by bacteria in the large intestine and are associated with lowered blood cholesterol and blood glucose.\nAll digestible carbohydrates, no matter their original form, are broken down into monosaccharides in the mouth, stomach and small intestine before entering the bloodstream. During digestion, sucrose is converted into equal parts of its components\u00e2\u0080\u0094glucose and fructose\u00e2\u0080\u0094which enter the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine. The blood delivers glucose and fructose to the liver.\nGlucose that is needed to meet immediate energy demands passes through the liver and back into the blood, continuing its journey to the cells. Most excess glucose is converted and stored in the liver as glycogen, a starch-like compound. Fructose is metabolized in the liver and converted to compounds used to produce glycogen. Since fructose is transformed into glycogen, very little fructose is actually found in the blood.\nWhen the body needs more energy, the liver converts glycogen back into glucose, which is then delivered by the bloodstream to the brain, muscle or other organs. Body cells break down blood sugar (glucose) into carbon dioxide and water, and energy is released.\nIn a normal person, the glucose level in the blood rises within 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pancreas responds by producing the hormone insulin, which lowers the blood sugar level by helping glucose enter the cells. Individual carbohydrate foods vary greatly in their effects on blood sugar. Some starchy carbohydrate foods, such as white bread, give a very rapid blood sugar response, while others, such as whole grain spaghetti, produce a slower rise. Sugar has a moderate effect on blood sugar and blood insulin.\nThe Glycemic Index, Insulin Resistance and Overweight\nSeveral articles in the popular press have promoted the theory that the growing prevalence of obesity in the U.S. is the result of increased blood glucose and insulin levels caused by the consumption of high-carbohydrate diets. According to this theory, diets high in total carbohydrate, especially ones that contain a large percentage of foods whose glycemic indexes approximate those of white bread and instant rice, lead to increased insulin levels, particularly in the 25% of the population believed to be insulin resistant. (Glycemic index is a way of measuring blood glucose response to a standard amount of a single, specific food. Insulin responses generally follow the same rank order of the glycemic responses, with the exception of protein foods which elicit an insulin response without an accompanying glycemic response.) This is purported to lead to an increased conversion of \u201cexcess\u201d carbohydrates to body fat. There are several reasons why this theory, which sounds plausible at first, does not make biological sense.\nFirst, the glycemic index was never intended to be used alone. It is merely one additional tool for researchers to use when studying the effects different foods have on blood sugar and insulin levels. It was certainly not developed to be used as a guide to which foods are most fattening. Second, it takes an extraordinary excess of carbohydrate to produce fat, and even then, very little net fat is produced from carbohydrate. Third, the idea that people with insulin resistance are particularly prone to obesity when eating high-carbohydrate diets is unsubstantiated by scientific evidence. Diets high in carbohydrates, including sugar, simply do not promote weight gain when they are consumed in amounts that do not exceed energy requirements. And last, researchers now believe that insulin resistance is caused by insulin receptors that don\u2019t respond properly, not by too many carbohydrates in the diet. The receptors\u2019 inability to respond to insulin is aggravated in people who are overweight or obese, more evidence supporting the positive effects of sustained, routine physical activity.\nExperts recognize that sugar is not uniquely problematic, even for diabetics. For most of this century, the most widely held belief about the treatment of diabetes was that sugars should be avoided and replaced with \u201ccomplex carbohydrates.\u201d The belief was based on the assumption that sugars are more rapidly digested and absorbed than are starches, thereby aggravating elevated blood sugar to a greater degree. That belief has persisted in the minds of consumers and scientists alike. However, according to the American Diabetes Association, there is very little scientific data to support this notion. Fruits and milk have been shown to have a lower glycemic response than most starches, and sucrose produces a glycemic response similar to that of rye bread, brown rice and sweet potatoes. And sweetened breakfast cereals often have a lower glycemic index than do some nonsweetened cereals.\nThe ideal amount of sugars to be included in the diet is not known. However, avoidance of sugar is not necessary for blood glucose control and is not advised because it may actually result in increased intakes of fat and starches with high-glycemic indexes. In fact, the American Diabetes Association now states that the use of sucrose as part of a meal plan does not impair blood glucose control in people with diabetes and may be substituted for other carbohydrates, as long as it is not added to the total carbohydrate already allowed.\nIt may be true that prolonged high blood glucose and insulin responses following food intake may promote development of glucose intolerance, a forerunner of type 2 diabetes, but since most cooked or refined starchy foods produce higher blood glucose and insulin responses than sucrose, this does not indict sugar or the other carbohydrate sweeteners as a causative factor. There is no evidence that sucrose causes a deterioration of blood glucose control in the long term, nor is there any evidence that sucrose causes excess insulin secretion, predisposing people to diabetes. Excess calories, whether from protein, fat or carbohydrate, that result in weight gain do, however, increase the risk for developing type 2 diabetes.\nWhile there is no evidence that carbohydrates in general or sugar in particular affect insulin resistance or the development of type 2 diabetes, increased physical activity coupled with weight loss have been proven to improve insulin resistance and lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, as well as the health risks that typically accompany it over the long term.\nAre All Calories Created Equal?\nDespite the widely held belief that \u201ca calorie is a calorie\u201d a number of studies suggest that, in the short-term, all calories are not equal and that excess calories from a high-fat diet play a unique role in weight gain. Research shows that when similar levels of excess calories (normalized to baseline energy requirements) are consumed, more body fat is gained when a high-fat diet is eaten than when the excess calories come from a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. This apparent anomaly occurs because there is an oxidation hierarchy of metabolic fuels (protein > carbohydrate > fat).\nExcess dietary fat is more likely to be stored as body fat, and with greater efficiency, than excess protein or carbohydrate. Specifically, short-term carbohydrate overfeeding produces progressive and rapid increases in carbohydrate oxidation whereas short-term fat over-feeding has little effect on fat oxidation. Only 75% to 85% of excess carbohydrate calories, compared to 90% to 95% of excess fat calories, are stored as body fat.\nThe more prolonged the overfeeding, the less the difference between carbohydrate and fat calories. The oxidative difference between excess carbohydrate and fat calories peaks during the first seven days of overfeeding.\nWhichever theory applies to the development of obesity, balancing energy intakes and expenditures is mandatory. Increased physical activity is the key to achieving this balance.\nInfluence of Sugar Intake on Total Food Intake and Obesity\nThe liking for sweet taste begins at birth and is thought to be innate. Although there is little evidence that sugar itself contributes to excessive food intake and obesity, sugar increases the palatability of foods and is often associated with fat in foods, which is associated with obesity. Evidence for a positive relationship between dietary fat and body weight is found in epidemiologic and observational studies, animal feeding trials and short-term interventions. Moreover, there are very few populations around the world who eat a low-fat diet and have a significant problem with obesity, a finding that supports the suggestion that consumption of low-fat diets may be protective, while high-fat diets may promote obesity. Estimates of food intake in a group of people from the National Weight Control Registry who had successfully maintained weight loss led to the conclusion that consumption of a low-fat diet (approximately 20% of energy from fat) along with regular physical activity is the key to long- term weight maintenance.Contrary to many people\u2019s belief that sugar contributes to obesity, research has found that groups consuming the most sugar actually have the lowest levels of obesity. This is most likely because of the \u201cfat-sugar see-saw.\u201d That is, as sugar intake goes up, fat intake goes down. Due to differences in levels of physical activity coupled with inherent genetic variability, it is well recognized that some people are more susceptible to weight gain while eating high-fat diets. Moreover, the major impact of reducing fat intake may not be in reversing obesity, but in preventing weight gain in the first place.The regulation of food intake is thought to be the main difference between carbohydrate and fat. There is considerable experimental evidence that high-fat, high-energy diets undermine the weight regulatory systems of humans and promote obesity. In contrast, high-carbohydrate diets don\u2019t seem to have the same disruptive effect on weight regulation, and in this respect, these lower energy dense diets seem to have a useful role in the long-term prevention of obesity.\nSome research also suggests that despite the widely held beliefs that fat is more satiating than carbohydrates, and that carbohydrates, especially sugar, trigger overeating, carbohydrates may actually regulate appetite better than fat. One study found that when a premeal feeding was given as carbohydrate, caloric intake was balanced over the rest of the day so that there was no significant difference in overall energy intake between the low- and high- calorie premeal feedings or controls. On the other hand, when the excess calories were provided as fat, the total intake over the day was significantly higher because of a failure to compensate for the additional calories. Studies looking specifically at sugar have found that a premeal drink or snack containing sugar did not suppress appetite, but neither did it trigger overeating.\nHigh-fat diets can easily result in the unintentional overconsumption of calories. The opposite appears to be true for carbohydrates. Even in studies in which the goal is to maintain a constant energy intake, energy intake often is reduced unintentionally when a low-fat diet, high-carbohydrate diet is consumed. Moreover, there is no evidence to support the suggestion that sugar is unique among dietary carbohydrates as an appetite stimulant.\nStill, the theory that sugar is somehow uniquely fattening persists. Carbohydrates, including sugar, were blamed when data from NHANES III showed that while the percentage of fat in Americans\u2019 diets was dropping, obesity was on the rise. This apparent anomaly led to the popularized conclusion that lower-fat, higher-carbohydrate diets led to increased insulin levels, particularly in insulin-resistant people, causing the increased amount of carbohydrate to be stored as fat. However, a closer look at the NHANES III data revealed that while fat as a percent of total caloric intake dropped from the NHANES II survey, the absolute amount of fat consumed had not changed. The drop in percent calories from fat resulted simply because total calories had increased. And in fact, it has been suggested that fat intake may be even higher than dietary surveys such as NHANES find, since many people underreport fat consumption because of its negative health connotations.\nA recent study provides further evidence that sugar is not uniquely fattening. A group of sixty women who were 130% to 200% of their ideal body weight were given either high- or low-sucrose, low-fat, reduced-calorie diets as a part of a six-week weight-loss program. The researchers found that a high intake of sucrose did not adversely affect weight loss when compared with a diet in which sucrose was replaced by starches and the artificial sweetener aspartame. Both groups showed equally significant reductions in weight and percentage body fat.\nFood and Taste Preferences and Weight\nAlthough a preference for sweet taste does not account for obesity, preference for fat may be a factor. Research shows that obese individuals prefer the same concentration of sugar but higher concentrations of fat than normal- weight individuals. Obese women generally prefer fat-sweet combinations, particularly desserts, whereas obese men prefer the salt-fat taste of high-protein, high-fat meats and high-fat, salty snacks. It is often overlooked that sugar is not the main source of energy in many popular sweet foods; chocolate, cookies, cake, ice cream, and sweetened dairy drinks derive most of their calories from fat. If you consider that the obese seem to be less able than normal weight individuals to respond to internal cues to stop eating, it makes sense that eating fat-sweet foods, especially for obese women could lead to overeating. Since most fat-sweet foods also contain other types of carbohydrate, it is difficult to target sugar as an overeating trigger. There is no research describing the effect of sucrose on appetite compared to carbohydrates that are not sweet.\nA review of the effect of sugar on appetite found that there was no consistent evidence to label sugar as an appetite stimulant, thereby contributing to excess caloric intake and obesity. Some studies report appetite suppression, while others show appetite stimulation or no appetite effect. Because most of the studies were short- term\u00e2\u0080\u0094five days or less\u00e2\u0080\u0094they may not be appropriate for testing the effect of any particular food or nutrient on appetite. Research shows that although individual food intakes vary by about 30% from day to day, body weight remains stable. This suggests that body weight regulation is achieved through long-term, not-short term adjustments in food intake, rendering such short-term studies relatively meaningless.\nEating Healthfully for Weight Management\nA high-carbohydrate (55% to 60% of calories), low-fat (20% to 25% of calories) diet remains the best recommendation for weight loss and weight maintenance as well as for overall healthful eating. A high- carbohydrate diet appears to reduce the likelihood of overeating, rather than increasing it, as some popular diet theories purport. And if overeating does occur on a high-carbohydrate diet, it is slightly less likely to be stored as body fat. Moreover, the inclusion of sucrose in a high-carbohydrate diet does not increase the likelihood of weight gain or the development of glucose intolerance or diabetes.Also critical to a healthful weight-management diet is the inclusion of five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Study after study clearly indicate a positive relationship between consumption of fruits and vegetables and a lower incidence of several diseases including cancer, heart disease and high blood pressure. They are good sources of fiber, which may play a role in controlling weight, regulating blood sugar, lowering blood cholesterol and preventing constipation. And they provide a vast array of phytochemicals, naturally occurring plant compounds that researchers believe play an important role in disease prevention.\nBridging the Gap with Physical Activity\nObesity is ultimately an issue of long-term positive energy balance, with too many calories consumed and not enough burned off, and occurs regardless of the source of the excess calories. Energy balance is determined not by diet or activity alone, but by the interaction between the two. Inactivity contributes to an energy imbalance that leads to weight gain and, if left unchecked, obesity and its accompanying health risks. In fact, the transition to a habitually sedentary lifestyle has been identified as the major contributor to the growing obesity rate in both the U.S. and the UK. Not only does regular physical activity reduce the risk of obesity, it also lowers coronary disease risk factors, including high blood pressure and elevated triglycerides, increases HDL-cholesterol and improves glucose tolerance with or without weight loss. Research suggests it may also reduce the risk of some kinds of cancer. In 1998, an expert panel recommended that all adults set a long-term goal to accumulate at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the week. However, the 1996 Surgeon General\u2019s Report on Physical Activity found that 60% of American adults are not regularly active and that 25% engage in no activity at all. Inactivity is a growing problem in children and adolescents as well. Only about one-half of young people ages 12 to 21 years regularly participate in vigorous physical activity. One-fourth report no vigorous activity at all. Some of the increase in inactivity has been blamed on television. One study found that in a group of 10 to 15 year olds, the odds of being overweight were 4.6 times greater among those who watched more than five hours of television a day, compared to those who watched two hours a day or less. The appeal of television, electronic games and computers has increased the time spent in sedentary pursuits among children and adults alike.\nYears of research has uncovered several important aspects of a combined aerobic and resistance exercise program in relation to weight management.\n1. It promotes fat loss while preserving or increasing muscle mass.\n2. Although the rate of weight loss resulting from increased physical activity without reduced calories is relatively slow, the combination of increased physical activity and reduced calorie intake appears to be more effective for long-term weight regulation than is dieting alone.\n3. Reducing the risk of regaining lost weight, or minimizing weight gain in the first place, is directly related to the frequency and duration of exercise.\n4. A reduced-fat diet markedly improves the potential of physical activity to achieve a negative energy balance.\n5. Physical activity programs do not produce a compensatory increase in food intake in obese individuals.\n6. Daily physical activity may assist weight loss by partially lessening the slow-down in metabolism that occurs during weight loss.\nFunding for this paper was provided by The Sugar Association, Inc.\nFor copies, contact The Sugar Association, Inc., 1101 15th Street, NW, Suite 600 Washington, D.C. 20005 (202)785-1122.\nThis document may be reproduced without permission.\n3 Responses to \u201cSugar white paper\u201d\nAlcinda Moore, January 14, 2006 at 8:54 pm\nFunny\u2026the link worked for me tonight!\nLois Hollan, June 13, 2006 at 7:25 pm\nReplace \u201cForward\u201d with Foreword.\nHi Lois\u2013\nI have rescued your comment from the Junk Comments file, where it landed because you didn\u2019t type the code word \u2018lowcarb\u2019 in at the bottom.

So I thought I would do a little post on what exactly it is and how it is much better for you than regular white sugar or any of that crappy artificial stuff.\nWhat is Coconut sugar?\nIt is a natural sugar that comes from the coconut palm tree. Coconut sugar is nothing new. It has been used as a traditional sweetener for generations in South East Asian countries. It is considered a low-carb sugar (awesome right?!) because it has a lower glycemic (less impact on blood sugar) than regular white sugar. This is a great substitute for people with diabetes. Since I am a type 1 diabetic I was so excited when I discovered this. It also measures out exactly the same as sugar does, so if a recipe calls for one cup of sugar, you would use one cup of coconut sugar.\nWhat does it taste like?\nYou don't want to bake a delicious batch of cookies only to be disappointed right? Coconut sugar resembles a subtle version of brown sugar with a hint of maple syrup. It is not overpowering like some artificial sweeteners can be. As Goldilocks would say,\" It is not too sweet, it's not too plain..it is just right.\" :)\nWhere can you buy it?\nYou can find it at your local health food stores as well as Asian grocery stores.

These are all added sugars that sweeten the taste of beverages and foods. Added sugars are not naturally occurring sugars in food and, according to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans , contribute to about 16% of the average American's overall daily caloric intake. For the average 2000 calorie diet that's 320 calories a day just from added sugars! According to a USDA article , almost 50% of our added sugar intake is directly from sugar sweetened beverages! While sipping on sweet tea may be a Sunday supper tradition, consider some of the sugar free sweetening options to lighten the carbohydrate load which may help keep your blood sugar in check and aid in slimming down your waist.\nLet's put the drinks and sugar into proportion. If you grab a 20 oz bottle of cola from a vending machine, you tack on an extra 240 calories that day. A small 8 oz coffee with cream and sugar can load on an additional 90 calories and 6 grams of sugar. When trying to quantify the amount of sugar in an item about 4 grams of sugar is the equivalent of 1 tsp of sugar.\nDon't forget juices are full of sugar and calories. The sugar may be \"natural\" or sometimes added-in to contribute to taste, but whatever the form it has the same impact on your blood sugar. Fruit juice is better than other sweetened beverages because it offers the benefits of vitamins from the fruit (for example, it is more nutrient dense than soda) but it is best to eat the actual fruit to get the nutrients, fiber, and satiety that come from produce. If your only option for a serving of fruit is a quick glass of O.J., then check the portion size and take a gulp. Portion sizes on juices are about \u00bd cup per a serving. Considering this small portion it is wise to mix your juice with water. Mixing \u00bd juice with water will extend the portion size and help quench your thirst while drinking some of your vitamins!

Padnor, PA, USA\nCurrently published by Warner Books, USA.\nWHY SUGAR IS TOXIC TO THE BODY\nIn 1957, Dr William Coda Martin tried to answer the question: When is a food a food and when is it a poison? His working definition of \"poison\" was: \"Medically: Any substance applied to the body, ingested or developed within the body, which causes or may cause disease. Physically: Any substance which inhibits the activity of a catalyst which is a minor substance, chemical or enzyme that activates a reaction.\" 1 The dictionary gives an even broader definition for \"poison\": \"to exert a harmful influence on, or to pervert\".\nDr Martin classified refined sugar as a poison because it has been depleted of its life forces, vitamins and minerals. \"What is left consists of pure, refined carbohydrates. The body cannot utilize this refined starch and carbohydrate unless the depleted proteins, vitamins and minerals are present. Nature supplies these elements in each plant in quantities sufficient to metabolize the carbohydrate in that particular plant. There is no excess for other added carbohydrates. Incomplete carbohydrate metabolism results in the formation of 'toxic metabolite' such as pyruvic acid and abnormal sugars containing five carbon atoms. Pyruvic acid accumulates in the brain and nervous system and the abnormal sugars in the red blood cells. These toxic metabolites interfere with the respiration of the cells. They cannot get sufficient oxygen to survive and function normally. In time, some of the cells die. This interferes with the function of a part of the body and is the beginning of degenerative disease.\" 2\nRefined sugar is lethal when ingested by humans because it provides only that which nutritionists describe as \"empty\" or \"naked\" calories. It lacks the natural minerals which are present in the sugar beet or cane. In addition, sugar is worse than nothing because it drains and leaches the body of precious vitamins and minerals through the demand its digestion, detoxification and elimination make upon one's entire system.\nSo essential is balance to our bodies that we have many ways to provide against the sudden shock of a heavy intake of sugar. Minerals such as sodium (from salt), potassium and magnesium (from vegetables), and calcium (from the bones) are mobilized and used in chemical transmutation; neutral acids are produced which attempt to return the acid-alkaline balance factor of the blood to a more normal state.\nSugar taken every day produces a continuously overacid condition, and more and more minerals are required from deep in the body in the attempt to rectify the imbalance. Finally, in order to protect the blood, so much calcium is taken from the bones and teeth that decay and general weakening begin.\nExcess sugar eventually affects every organ in the body. Initially, it is stored in the liver in the form of glucose (glycogen). Since the liver's capacity is limited, a daily intake of refined sugar (above the required amount of natural sugar) soon makes the liver expand like a balloon. When the liver is filled to its maximum capacity, the excess glycogen is returned to the blood in the form of fatty acids. These are taken to every part of the body and stored in the most inactive areas: the belly, the buttocks, the breasts and the thighs.\nWhen these comparatively harmless places are completely filled, fatty acids are then distributed among active organs, such as the heart and kidneys. These begin to slow down; finally their tissues degenerate and turn to fat. The whole body is affected by their reduced ability, and abnormal blood pressure is created. The parasympathetic nervous system is affected; and organs governed by it, such as the small brain, become inactive or paralyzed. (Normal brain function is rarely thought of as being as biologic as digestion.) The circulatory and lymphatic systems are invaded, and the quality of the red corpuscles starts to change. An overabundance of white cells occurs, and the creation of tissue becomes slower. Our body's tolerance and immunizing power becomes more limited, so we cannot respond properly to extreme attacks, whether they be cold, heat, mosquitoes or microbes.\nExcessive sugar has a strong mal-effect on the functioning of the brain. The key to orderly brain function is glutamic acid, a vital compound found in many vegetables. The B vitamins play a major role in dividing glutamic acid into antagonistic-complementary compounds which produce a \"proceed\" or \"control\" response in the brain. B vitamins are also manufactured by symbiotic bacteria which live in our intestines. When refined sugar is taken daily, these bacteria wither and die, and our stock of B vitamins gets very low. Too much sugar makes one sleepy; our ability to calculate and remember is lost.\nSUGAR: HARMFUL TO HUMANS AND ANIMALS\nShipwrecked sailors who ate and drank nothing but sugar and rum for nine days surely went through some of this trauma; the tales they had to tell created a big public relations problem for the sugar pushers.\nThis incident occurred when a vessel carrying a cargo of sugar was shipwrecked in 1793. The five surviving sailors were finally rescued after being marooned for nine days. They were in a wasted condition due to starvation, having consumed nothing but sugar and rum.\nThe eminent French physiologist F. Magendie was inspired by that incident to conduct a series of experiments with animals, the results of which he published in 1816. In the experiments, he fed dogs a diet of sugar or olive oil and water. All the dogs wasted and died. 3\nThe shipwrecked sailors and the French physiologist's experimental dogs proved the same point. As a steady diet, sugar is worse than nothing. Plain water can keep you alive for quite some time. Sugar and water can kill you. Humans [and animals] are \"unable to subsist on a diet of sugar\". 4\nThe dead dogs in Professor Magendie's laboratory alerted the sugar industry to the hazards of free scientific inquiry. From that day to this, the sugar industry has invested millions of dollars in behind-the-scenes, subsidized science. The best scientific names that money could buy have been hired, in the hope that they could one day come up with something at least pseudoscientific in the way of glad tidings about sugar.\nIt has been proved, however, that (1) sugar is a major factor in dental decay; (2) sugar in a person's diet does cause overweight; (3) removal of sugar from diets has cured symptoms of crippling, worldwide diseases such as diabetes, cancer and heart illnesses.\nSir Frederick Banting, the codiscoverer of insulin, noticed in 1929 in Panama that, among sugar plantation owners who ate large amounts of their refined stuff, diabetes was common. Among native cane-cutters, who only got to chew the raw cane, he saw no diabetes.\nHowever, the story of the public relations attempts on the part of the sugar manufacturers began in Britain in 1808 when the Committee of West India reported to the House of Commons that a prize of twenty-five guineas had been offered to anyone who could come up with the most \"satisfactory\" experiments to prove that unrefined sugar was good for feeding and fattening oxen, cows, hogs and sheep. 5 Food for animals is often seasonal, always expensive. Sugar, by then, was dirt cheap. People weren't eating it fast enough.\nNaturally, the attempt to feed livestock with sugar and molasses in England in 1808 was a disaster. When the Committee on West India made its fourth report to the House of Commons, one Member of Parliament, John Curwin, reported that he had tried to feed sugar and molasses to calves without success. He suggested that perhaps someone should try again by sneaking sugar and molasses into skimmed milk. Had anything come of that, you can be sure the West Indian sugar merchants would have spread the news around the world. After this singular lack of success in pushing sugar in cow pastures, the West Indian sugar merchants gave up.\nWith undaunted zeal for increasing the market demand for the most important agricultural product of the West Indies, the Committee of West India was reduced to a tactic that has served the sugar pushers for almost 200 years: irrelevant and transparently silly testimonials from faraway, inaccessible people with some kind of \"scientific\" credentials. One early commentator called them \"hired consciences\".\nThe House of Commons committee was so hard-up for local cheerleaders on the sugar question, it was reduced to quoting a doctor from faraway Philadelphia, a leader of the recent American colonial rebellion: \"The great Dr Rush of Philadelphia is reported to have said that 'sugar contains more nutrients in the same bulk than any other known substance'.\" (Emphasis added.) At the same time, the same Dr Rush was preaching that masturbation was the cause of insanity! If a weasel-worded statement like that was quoted, one can be sure no animal doctor could be found in Britain who would recommend sugar for the care and feeding of cows, pigs or sheep.\nWhile preparing his epochal volume, A History of Nutrition, published in 1957, Professor E. V. McCollum (Johns Hopkins University), sometimes called America's foremost nutritionist and certainly a pioneer in the field, reviewed approximately 200,000 published scientific papers, recording experiments with food, their properties, their utilization and their effects on animals and men. The material covered the period from the mid-18th century to 1940. From this great repository of scientific inquiry, McCollum selected those experiments which he regarded as significant \"to relate the story of progress in discovering human error in this segment of science [of nutrition]\". Professor McCollum failed to record a single controlled scientific experiment with sugar between 1816 and 1940.\nUnhappily, we must remind ourselves that scientists today, and always, accomplish little without a sponsor. The protocols of modern science have compounded the costs of scientific inquiry.\nWe have no right to be surprised when we read the introduction to McCollum's A History of Nutrition and find that \"The author and publishers are indebted to The Nutrition Foundation, Inc., for a grant provided to meet a portion of the cost of publication of this book\". What, you might ask, is The Nutrition Foundation, Inc.? The author and the publishers don't tell you. It happens to be a front organization for the leading sugar-pushing conglomerates in the food business, including the American Sugar Refining Company, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Curtis Candy Co., General Foods, General Mills, Nestl\u00e9 Co., Pet Milk Co. and Sunshine Biscuits-about 45 such companies in all.\nPerhaps the most significant thing about McCollum's 1957 history was what he left out: a monumental earlier work described by an eminent Harvard professor as \"one of those epochal pieces of research which makes every other investigator desirous of kicking himself because he never thought of doing the same thing\". In the 1930s, a research dentist from Cleveland, Ohio, Dr Weston A. Price, traveled all over the world-from the lands of the Eskimos to the South Sea Islands, from Africa to New Zealand. His Nutrition and Physical Degeneration: A Comparison of Primitive and Modern Diets and Their Effects, 6 which is illustrated with hundreds of photographs, was first published in 1939.\nDr Price took the whole world as his laboratory. His devastating conclusion, recorded in horrifying detail in area after area, was simple. People who live under so-called backward primitive conditions had excellent teeth and wonderful general health. They ate natural, unrefined food from their own locale. As soon as refined, sugared foods were imported as a result of contact with \"civilization\", physical degeneration began in a way that was definitely observable within a single generation.\nAny credibility the sugar pushers have is based on our ignorance of works like that of Dr Price. Sugar manufacturers keep trying, hoping and contributing generous research grants to colleges and universities; but the research laboratories never come up with anything solid the manufacturers can use. Invariably, the research results are bad news.\n\"Let us go to the ignorant savage, consider his way of eating and be wise,\" Harvard professor Ernest Hooten said in Apes, Men, and Morons. 7 \"Let us cease pretending that toothbrushes and toothpaste are any more important than shoe brushes and shoe polish. It is store food that has given us store teeth.\"\nWhen the researchers bite the hands that feed them, and the news gets out, it's embarrassing all around. In 1958, Time magazine reported that a Harvard biochemist and his assistants had worked with myriads of mice for more than ten years, bankrolled by the Sugar Research Foundation, Inc. to the tune of $57,000, to find out how sugar causes dental cavities and how to prevent this. It took them ten years to discover that there was no way to prevent sugar causing dental decay. When the researchers reported their findings in the Dental Association Journal, their source of money dried up. The Sugar Research Foundation withdrew its support.\nThe more that the scientists disappointed them, the more the sugar pushers had to rely on the ad men.\nSUCROSE: \"PURE\" ENERGY AT A PRICE\nWhen calories became the big thing in the 1920s, and everybody was learning to count them, the sugar pushers turned up with a new pitch. They boasted there were 2,500 calories in a pound of sugar. A little over a quarter-pound of sugar would produce 20 per cent of the total daily quota.\n\"If you could buy all your food energy as cheaply as you buy calories in sugar,\" they told us, \"your board bill for the year would be very low. If sugar were seven cents a pound, it would cost less than $35 for a whole year.\"\nA very inexpensive way to kill yourself.\n\"Of course, we don't live on any such unbalanced diet,\" they admitted later. \"But that figure serves to point out how inexpensive sugar is as an energy-building food. What was once a luxury only a privileged few could enjoy is now a food for the poorest of people.\"\nLater, the sugar pushers advertised that sugar was chemically pure, topping Ivory soap in that department, being 99.9 per cent pure against Ivory's vaunted 99.44 per cent. \"No food of our everyday diet is purer,\" we were assured.\nWhat was meant by purity, besides the unarguable fact that all vitamins, minerals, salts, fibres and proteins had been removed in the refining process? Well, the sugar pushers came up with a new slant on purity.\n\"You don't have to sort it like beans, wash it like rice. Every grain is like every other. No waste attends its use. No useless bones like in meat, no grounds like coffee.\"\n\"Pure\" is a favorite adjective of the sugar pushers because it means one thing to the chemists and another thing to the ordinary mortals. When honey is labeled pure, this means that it is in its natural state (stolen directly from the bees who made it), with no adulteration with sucrose to stretch it and no harmful chemical residues which may have been sprayed on the flowers. It does not mean that the honey is free from minerals like iodine, iron, calcium, phosphorus or multiple vitamins. So effective is the purification process which sugar cane and beets undergo in the refineries that sugar ends up as chemically pure as the morphine or the heroin a chemist has on the laboratory shelves. What nutritional virtue this abstract chemical purity represents, the sugar pushers never tell us.\nBeginning with World War I, the sugar pushers coated their propaganda with a preparedness pitch. \"Dietitians have known the high food value of sugar for a long time,\" said an industry tract of the 1920s. \"But it took World War I to bring this home. The energy-building power of sugar reaches the muscles in minutes and it was of value to soldiers as a ration given them just before an attack was launched.\" The sugar pushers have been harping on the energy-building power of sucrose for years because it contains nothing else. Caloric energy and habit-forming taste: that's what sucrose has, and nothing else.\nAll other foods contain energy plus. All foods contain some nutrients in the way of proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins or minerals, or all of these. Sucrose contains caloric energy, period.\nThe \"quick\" energy claim the sugar pushers talk about, which drives reluctant doughboys over the top and drives children up the wall, is based on the fact that refined sucrose is not digested in the mouth or the stomach but passes directly to the lower intestines and thence to the bloodstream. The extra speed with which sucrose enters the bloodstream does more harm than good.\nMuch of the public confusion about refined sugar is compounded by language. Sugars are classified by chemists as \"carbohydrates\". This manufactured word means \"a substance containing carbon with oxygen and hydrogen\". If chemists want to use these hermetic terms in their laboratories when they talk to one another, fine. The use of the word \"carbohydrate\" outside the laboratory-especially in food labeling and advertising lingo-to describe both natural, complete cereal grains (which have been a principal food of mankind for thousands of years) and man-refined sugar (which is a manufactured drug and principal poison of mankind for only a few hundred years) is demonstrably wicked. This kind of confusion makes possible the flimflam practiced by sugar pushers to confound anxious mothers into thinking kiddies need sugar to survive.\nIn 1973, the Sugar Information Foundation placed full-page advertisements in national magazines. Actually, the ads were disguised retractions they were forced to make in a strategic retreat after a lengthy tussle with the Federal Trade Commission over an earlier ad campaign claiming that a little shot of sugar before meals would \"curb\" your appetite. \"You need carbohydrates. And it so happens that sugar is the best-tasting carbohydrate.\" You might as well say everybody needs liquids every day. It so happens that many people find champagne is the best-tasting liquid. How long would the Women's Christian Temperance Union let the liquor lobby get away with that one?\nThe use of the word \"carbohydrate\" to describe sugar is deliberately misleading. Since the improved labeling of nutritional properties was required on packages and cans, refined carbohydrates like sugar are lumped together with those carbohydrates which may or may not be refined. The several types of carbohydrates are added together for an overall carbohydrate total. Thus, the effect of the label is to hide the sugar content from the unwary buyer. Chemists add to the confusion by using the word \"sugar\" to describe an entire group of substances that are similar but not identical.\nGlucose is a sugar found usually with other sugars, in fruits and vegetables. It is a key material in the metabolism of all plants and animals. Many of our principal foods are converted into glucose in our bodies. Glucose is always present in our bloodstream, and it is often called \"blood sugar\".\nDextrose, also called \"corn sugar\", is derived synthetically from starch. Fructose is fruit sugar. Maltose is malt sugar. Lactose is milk sugar. Sucrose is refined sugar made from sugar cane and sugar beet.\nGlucose has always been an essential element in the human bloodstream. Sucrose addiction is something new in the history of the human animal. To use the word \"sugar\" to describe two substances which are far from being identical, which have different chemical structures and which affect the body in profoundly different ways compounds confusion.\nIt makes possible more flimflam from the sugar pushers who tell us how important sugar is as an essential component of the human body, how it is oxidized to produce energy, how it is metabolized to produce warmth, and so on. They're talking about glucose, of course, which is manufactured in our bodies. However, one is led to believe that the manufacturers are talking about the sucrose which is made in their refineries. When the word \"sugar\" can mean the glucose in your blood as well as the sucrose in your Coca-Cola, it's great for the sugar pushers but it's rough on everybody else.\nPeople have been bamboozled into thinking of their bodies the way they think of their cheque accounts. If they suspect they have low blood sugar, they are programmed to snack on vending machine candies and sodas in order to raise their blood sugar level. Actually, this is the worst thing to do. The level of glucose in their blood is apt to be low because they are addicted to sucrose. People who kick sucrose addiction and stay off sucrose find that the glucose level of their blood returns to normal and stays there.\nSince the late 1960s, millions of Americans have returned to natural food. A new type of store, the natural food store, has encouraged many to become dropouts from the supermarket. Natural food can be instrumental in restoring health. Many people, therefore, have come to equate the word \"natural\" with \"healthy\". So the sugar pushers have begun to pervert the word \"natural\" in order to mislead the public.\n\"Made from natural ingredients\", the television sugar-pushers tell us about product after product. The word \"from\" is not accented on television. It should be. Even refined sugar is made from natural ingredients. There is nothing new about that. The natural ingredients are cane and beets. But that four-letter word \"from\" hardly suggests that 90 per cent of the cane and beet have been removed. Heroin, too, could be advertised as being made from natural ingredients. The opium poppy is as natural as the sugar beet. It's what man does with it that tells the story.\nIf you want to avoid sugar in the supermarket, there is only one sure way. Don't buy anything unless it says on the label prominently, in plain English: \"No sugar added\". Use of the word \"carbohydrate\" as a \"scientific\" word for sugar has become a standard defense strategy with sugar pushers and many of their medical apologists. It's their security blanket.\nCORRECT FOOD COMBINING\nWhether it's sugared cereal or pastry and black coffee for breakfast, whether it's hamburgers and Coca-Cola for lunch or the full \"gourmet\" dinner in the evening, chemically the average American diet is a formula that guarantees bubble, bubble, stomach trouble.\nUnless you've taken too much insulin and, in a state of insulin shock, need sugar as an antidote, hardly anyone ever has cause to take sugar alone. Humans need sugar as much as they need the nicotine in tobacco. Crave it is one thing-need it is another. From the days of the Persian Empire to our own, sugar has usually been used to hop up the flavour of other food and drink, as an ingredient in the kitchen or as a condiment at the table. Let us leave aside for the moment the known effect of sugar (long-term and short-term) on the entire system and concentrate on the effect of sugar taken in combination with other daily foods.\nWhen Grandma warned that sugared cookies before meals \"will spoil your supper\", she knew what she was talking about. Her explanation might not have satisfied a chemist but, as with many traditional axioms from the Mosaic law on kosher food and separation in the kitchen, such rules are based on years of trial and error and are apt to be right on the button. Most modern research in combining food is a laboured discovery of the things Grandma took for granted.\nAny diet or regimen undertaken for the single purpose of losing weight is dangerous, by definition. Obesity is talked about and treated as a disease in 20th-century America. Obesity is not a disease. It is only a symptom, a sign, a warning that your body is out of order. Dieting to lose weight is as silly and dangerous as taking aspirin to relieve a headache before you know the reason for the headache. Getting rid of a symptom is like turning off an alarm. It leaves the basic cause untouched.\nAny diet or regimen undertaken with any objective short of restoration of total health of your body is dangerous. Many overweight people are undernourished. (Dr H. Curtis Wood stresses this point in his 1971 book, Overfed But Undernourished.) Eating less can aggravate this condition, unless one is concerned with the quality of the food instead of just its quantity.\nMany people-doctors included-assume that if weight is lost, fat is lost. This is not necessarily so. Any diet which lumps all carbohydrates together is dangerous. Any diet which does not consider the quality of carbohydrates and makes the crucial life-and-death distinction between natural, unrefined carbohydrates like whole grains and vegetables and man-refined carbohydrates like sugar and white flour is dangerous. Any diet which includes refined sugar and white flour, no matter what \"scientific\" name is applied to them, is dangerous.\nKicking sugar and white flour and substituting whole grains, vegetables and natural fruits in season, is the core of any sensible natural regimen. Changing the quality of your carbohydrates can change the quality of your health and life. If you eat natural food of good quality, quantity tends to take care of itself. Nobody is going to eat a half-dozen sugar beets or a whole case of sugar cane. Even if they do, it will be less dangerous than a few ounces of sugar.\nSugar of all kinds-natural sugars, such as those in honey and fruit (fructose), as well as the refined white stuff (sucrose)-tends to arrest the secretion of gastric juices and have an inhibiting effect on the stomach's natural ability to move. Sugars are not digested in the mouth, like cereals, or in the stomach, like animal flesh. When taken alone, they pass quickly through the stomach into the small intestine. When sugars are eaten with other foods-perhaps meat and bread in a sandwich-they are held up in the stomach for a while. The sugar in the bread and the Coke sit there with the hamburger and the bun waiting for them to be digested. While the stomach is working on the animal protein and the refined starch in the bread, the addition of the sugar practically guarantees rapid acid fermentation under the conditions of warmth and moisture existing in the stomach.\nOne lump of sugar in your coffee after a sandwich is enough to turn your stomach into a fermenter. One soda with a hamburger is enough to turn your stomach into a still. Sugar on cereal-whether you buy it already sugared in a box or add it yourself-almost guarantees acid fermentation.\nSince the beginning of time, natural laws were observed, in both senses of that word, when it came to eating foods in combination. Birds have been observed eating insects at one period in the day and seeds at another. Other animals tend to eat one food at a time. Flesh-eating animals take their protein raw and straight.\nIn the Orient, it is traditional to eat yang before yin. Miso soup (fermented soybean protein, yang) for breakfast; raw fish (more yang protein) at the beginning of the meal; afterwards comes the rice (which is less yang than the miso and fish); and then the vegetables which are yin. If you ever eat with a traditional Japanese family and you violate this order, the Orientals (if your friends) will correct you courteously but firmly.\nThe law observed by Orthodox Jews prohibits many combinations at the same meal, especially flesh and dairy products. Special utensils for the dairy meal and different utensils for the flesh meal reinforce that taboo at the food's source in the kitchen.\nMan learned very early in the game what improper combinations of food could do to the human system. When he got a stomach ache from combining raw fruit with grain, or honey with porridge, he didn't reach for an antacid tablet. He learned not to eat that way. When gluttony and excess became widespread, religious codes and commandments were invoked against it. Gluttony is a capital sin in most religions; but there are no specific religious warnings or commandments against refined sugar because sugar abuse-like drug abuse-did not appear on the world scene until centuries after holy books had gone to press.\n\"Why must we accept as normal what we find in a race of sick and weakened human beings?\" Dr Herbert M. Shelton asks. \"Must we always take it for granted that the present eating practices of civilized men are normal?... Foul stools, loose stools, impacted stools, pebbly stools, much foul gas, colitis, haemorrhoids, bleeding with stools, the need for toilet paper are swept into the orbit of the normal.\"\nWhen starches and complex sugars (like those in honey and fruits) are digested, they are broken down into simple sugars called \"monosaccharides\", which are usable substances-nutriments. When starches and sugars are taken together and undergo fermentation, they are broken down into carbon dioxide, acetic acid, alcohol and water. With the exception of the water, all these are unusable substances-poisons.\nWhen proteins are digested, they are broken down into amino acids, which are usable substances-nutriments. When proteins are taken with sugar, they putrefy; they are broken down into a variety of ptomaines and leucomaines, which are nonusable substances-poisons.\nEnzymic digestion of foods prepares them for use by our body. Bacterial decomposition makes them unfit for use by our body. The first process gives us nutriments; the second gives us poisons.\nMuch that passes for modern nutrition is obsessed with a mania for quantitative counting. The body is treated like a cheque account. Deposit calories (like dollars) and withdraw energy. Deposit proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals-balanced quantitatively-and the result, theoretically, is a healthy body. People qualify as healthy today if they can crawl out of bed, get to the office and sign in. If they can't make it, call the doctor to qualify for sick pay, hospitalization, rest cure-anything from a day's pay without working to an artificial kidney, courtesy of the taxpayers.\nBut what doth it profit someone if the theoretically required calories and nutrients are consumed daily, yet this random eat-on-the-run, snack-time collection of foods ferments and putrefies in the digestive tract? What good is it if the body is fed protein, only to have it putrefy in the gastrointestinal canal? Carbohydrates that ferment in the digestive tract are converted into alcohol and acetic acid, not digestible monosaccharides.\n\"To derive sustenance from foods eaten, they must be digested,\" Shelton warned years ago. \"They must not rot.\"\nSure, the body can get rid of poisons through the urine and the pores; the amount of poisons in the urine is taken as an index to what's going on in the intestine. The body does establish a tolerance for these poisons, just as it adjusts gradually to an intake of heroin. But, says Shelton, \"the discomfort from accumulation of gas, the bad breath, and foul and unpleasant odors are as undesirable as are the poisons\".\nSUGAR AND MENTAL HEALTH\nIn the Dark Ages, troubled souls were rarely locked up for going off their rocker. Such confinement began in the Age of Enlightenment, after sugar made the transition from apothecary's prescription to candymaker's confection. \"The great confinement of the insane\", as one historian calls it, 10 began in the late 17th century, after sugar consumption in Britain had zoomed in 200 years from a pinch or two in a barrel of beer, here and there, to more than two million pounds per year. By that time, physicians in London had begun to observe and record terminal physical signs and symptoms of the \"sugar blues\".\nMeanwhile, when sugar eaters did not manifest obvious terminal physical symptoms and the physicians were professionally bewildered, patients were no longer pronounced bewitched, but mad, insane, emotionally disturbed. Laziness, fatigue, debauchery, parental displeasure-any one problem was sufficient cause for people under twenty-five to be locked up in the first Parisian mental hospitals. All it took to be incarcerated was a complaint from parents, relatives or the omnipotent parish priest. Wet nurses with their babies, pregnant youngsters, retarded or defective children, senior citizens, paralytics, epileptics, prostitutes or raving lunatics-anyone wanted off the streets and out of sight was put away. The mental hospital succeeded witch-hunting and heresy-hounding as a more enlightened and humane method of social control. The physician and priest handled the dirty work of street sweeping in return for royal favours.\nInitially, when the General Hospital was established in Paris by royal decree, one per cent of the city's population was locked up. From that time until the 20 century, as the consumption of sugar went up and up-especially in the cities-so did the number of people who were put away in the General Hospital. Three hundred years later, the \"emotionally disturbed\" can be turned into walking automatons, their brains controlled with psychoactive drugs.\nToday, pioneers of orthomolecular psychiatry, such as Dr Abram Hoffer, Dr Allan Cott, Dr A. Cherkin as well as Dr Linus Pauling, have confirmed that mental illness is a myth and that emotional disturbance can be merely the first symptom of the obvious inability of the human system to handle the stress of sugar dependency.\nIn Orthomolecular Psychiatry, Dr Pauling writes: \"The functioning of the brain and nervous tissue is more sensitively dependent on the rate of chemical reactions than the functioning of other organs and tissues. I believe that mental disease is for the most part caused by abnormal reaction rates, as determined by genetic constitution and diet, and by abnormal molecular concentrations of essential substances... Selection of food (and drugs) in a world that is undergoing rapid scientific and technological change may often be far from the best.\"\nIn Megavitamin B3 Therapy for Schizophrenia, Dr Abram Hoffer notes: \"Patients are also advised to follow a good nutritional program with restriction of sucrose and sucrose-rich foods.\"\nClinical research with hyperactive and psychotic children, as well as those with brain injuries and learning disabilities, has shown:\n\"An abnormally high family history of diabetes-that is, parents and grandparents who cannot handle sugar; an abnormally high incidence of low blood glucose, or functional hypoglycemia in the children themselves, which indicates that their systems cannot handle sugar; dependence on a high level of sugar in the diets of the very children who cannot handle it.\n\"Inquiry into the dietary history of patients diagnosed as schizophrenic reveals the diet of their choice is rich in sweets, candy, cakes, coffee, caffeinated beverages, and foods prepared with sugar. These foods, which stimulate the adrenals, should be eliminated or severely restricted.\"\nThe avant-garde of modern medicine has rediscovered what the lowly sorceress learned long ago through painstaking study of nature.\n\"In more than twenty years of psychiatric work,\" writes Dr Thomas Szasz, \"I have never known a clinical psychologist to report, on the basis of a projective test, that the subject is a normal, mentally healthy person. While some witches may have survived dunking, no 'madman' survives psychological testing...there is no behavior or person that a modern psychiatrist cannot plausibly diagnose as abnormal or ill.\"\nSo it was in the 17th century. Once the doctor or the exorcist had been called in, he was under pressure to do something. When he tried and failed, the poor patient had to be put away. It is often said that surgeons bury their mistakes. Physicians and psychiatrists put them away; lock 'em up.\nIn the 1940s, Dr John Tintera rediscovered the vital importance of the endocrine system, especially the adrenal glands, in \"pathological mentation\"-or \"brain boggling\". In 200 cases under treatment for hypoadrenocorticism (the lack of adequate adrenal cortical hormone production or imbalance among these hormones), he discovered that the chief complaints of his patients were often similar to those found in persons whose systems were unable to handle sugar: fatigue, nervousness, depression, apprehension, craving for sweets, inability to handle alcohol, inability to concentrate, allergies, low blood pressure. Sugar blues!\nDr Tintera finally insisted that all his patients submit to a four-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) to find out whether or not they could handle sugar. The results were so startling that the laboratories double-checked their techniques, then apologised for what they believed to be incorrect readings. What mystified them was the low, flat curves derived from disturbed, early adolescents. This laboratory procedure had been previously carried out only for patients with physical findings presumptive of diabetes.\nDorland's definition of schizophrenia (Bleuler's dementia praecox) includes the phrase, \"often recognized during or shortly after adolescence\", and further, in reference to hebephrenia and catatonia, \"coming on soon after the onset of puberty\".\nThese conditions might seem to arise or become aggravated at puberty, but probing into the patient's past will frequently reveal indications which were present at birth, during the first year of life, and through the preschool and grammar school years. Each of these periods has its own characteristic clinical picture. This picture becomes more marked at pubescence and often causes school officials to complain of juvenile delinquency or underachievement.\nA glucose tolerance test at any of these periods could alert parents and physicians and could save innumerable hours and small fortunes spent in looking into the child's psyche and home environment for maladjustments of questionable significance in the emotional development of the average child.\nThe negativism, hyperactivity and obstinate resentment of discipline are absolute indications for at least the minimum laboratory tests: urinalysis, complete bloodcount, PBI determination, and the five-hour glucose tolerance test. A GTT can be performed on a young child by the micro-method without undue trauma to the patient. As a matter of fact, I have been urging that these four tests be routine for all patients, even before a history or physical examination is undertaken.\nIn almost all discussions on drug addiction, alcoholism and schizophrenia, it is claimed that there is no definite constitutional type that falls prey to these afflictions. Almost universally, the statement is made that all of these individuals are emotionally immature. It has long been our goal to persuade every physician, whether oriented toward psychiatry, genetics or physiology, to recognise that one type of endocrine individual is involved in the majority of these cases: the hypoadrenocortic. 15\nTintera published several epochal medical papers. Over and over, he emphasised that improvement, alleviation, palliation or cure was \"dependent upon the restoration of the normal function of the total organism\". His first prescribed item of treatment was diet. Over and over again, he said that \"the importance of diet cannot be overemphasised\". He laid out a sweeping permanent injunction against sugar in all forms and guises.\nWhile Egas Moniz of Portugal was receiving a Nobel Prize for devising the lobotomy operation for the treatment of schizophrenia, Tintera's reward was to be harassment and hounding by the pundits of organised medicine. While Tintera's sweeping implication of sugar as a cause of what was called \"schizophrenia\" could be confined to medical journals, he was let alone, ignored. He could be tolerated-if he stayed in his assigned territory, endocrinology. Even when he suggested that alcoholism was related to adrenals that had been whipped by sugar abuse, they let him alone; because the medicos had decided there was nothing in alcoholism for them except aggravation, they were satisfied to abandon it to Alcoholics Anonymous. However, when Tintera dared to suggest in a magazine of general circulation that \"it is ridiculous to talk of kinds of allergies when there is only one kind, which is adrenal glands impaired...by sugar\", he could no longer be ignored.\nThe allergists had a great racket going for themselves. Allergic souls had been entertaining each other for years with tall tales of exotic allergies-everything from horse feathers to lobster tails. Along comes someone who says none of this matters: take them off sugar, and keep them off it.\nPerhaps Tintera's untimely death in 1969 at the age of fifty-seven made it easier for the medical profession to accept discoveries that had once seemed as far out as the simple oriental medical thesis of genetics and diet, yin and yang. Today, doctors all over the world are repeating what Tintera announced years ago: nobody, but nobody, should ever be allowed to begin what is called \"psychiatric treatment\", anyplace, anywhere, unless and until they have had a glucose tolerance test to discover if they can handle sugar.\nSo-called preventive medicine goes further and suggests that since we only think we can handle sugar because we initially have strong adrenals, why wait until they give us signs and signals that they're worn out? Take the load off now by eliminating sugar in all forms and guises, starting with that soda pop you have in your hand.\nThe mind truly boggles when one glances over what passes for medical history. Through the centuries, troubled souls have been barbecued for bewitchment, exorcised for possession, locked up for insanity, tortured for masturbatory madness, psychiatrised for psychosis, lobotomised for schizophrenia. How many patients would have listened if the local healer had told them that the only thing ailing them was sugar blues?\nEndnotes:\n1.

It is also about brown/ raw/ turbinado\u00a0sugar, molasses, syrups, and other concentrated sweeteners like : dextrose (glucose) , fructose, galactose, maltose, lactose, dextrin, dextrains,\u00a0 and honey. Our body digests and absorbs these concentrated sources of sugars rapidly, and quickly turns them into saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. If we do not burn off the fat through activity, it will start accumulating under our skin,in our lever in our arteries and other organs.\nOne thing is common characteristic for all those sweeteners: they are concentrated and composed of simple sugars\u00a0 (monosaccharide\u00a0 and disaccharide). Simple sugars are also called rapid sugars because they do not need digestion and are absorbed rapidly in our bloodstream.\nAfter being absorbed in our bloodstream, they rise blood glucose levels too high. This condition is called hyperglycemia, and is one of the symptoms of diabetes. If or pancreas function as it should, it will produce enough insulin to remove excess glucose from our bloodstream with amazing efficiency.\nBut huge production of insulin can not be stopped in the same moment as sugar stop coming in the bloodstream. To much insulin will then cause too rapid fall of glucose level in the blood. That is called hypoglycemia, and symptoms may include depression, dizziness, crying spells, aggression, insomnia, weakness, and even loss of consciousness.\nWhen blood glucose falls too low, our adrenal glands will mobilize the body's stores of glycogen (starch like carbohydrate , many glucose molecules hooked end to end in a chain,stored in liver and muscle) and will also stimulate the synthesis of glucose from proteins and other substances present in our body.\nA diet rich in sugars will catch our pancreas and adrenal glands in a biochemical see-saw, overworking them. It could weaken pancreas and result in diabetes. Cardiovascular complications that follow excess glucose or fats kill many diabetics.\u00a0If our body is unable to use all of the extra fats and cholesterol produced from sugars,it must dump the additional load. Fats can be deposited in the cells of our liver, heart, arteries, fat tissues, kidneys, muscles, and other organs.\u00a0 That is beginning of\u00a0 fatty degeneration.\nOne of the aspects of fatty degeneration is deposition of visible fat in places where it is not normally found in healthy people. Fatty degeneration includes atherosclerosis, fatty liver and kidneys, some tumors, obesity and some forms of diabetes.\nSugars inhibit the function of our immune system, and increase diseases caused by poor immune function, such as colds, flu, AIDS, allergies, infections, ...\nSugars increase our body's production of adrenaline by four times, which puts the body into a state of\u00a0 'fight or flight'\u00a0 stress, without anything to fight or flee from , except the consumption of sugar. This stress reaction increases the production of both cholesterol and cortisone. Cortisone inhibits immune function.\nSugars lack the vitamins and minerals required for their own metabolism. To be metabolized, sugars must draw on our body's stores of these nutrients. The more sugars you eat, the more vitamins and minerals you need.\nIt can leach B, C, D\u00a0 vitamins, and those minerals:\ncalcium, phosphorous, iron, selenium, zinc, chromium, vanadium, tin, boron, bismuth, rear earth elements etc. from our teeth, bones, and tissues.\nAs these are depleted, our body becomes less able to carry out other functions that require minerals and vitamins to be present: to metabolize fats and cholesterol; to convert cholesterol into bile acids for removal from our body through the stool; or to burn-off excess fats as heat or increased activity. As a result , our cholesterol level rises; our metabolic rate goes down; fats burn more slowly; gall stones are crystallizing in or liver; we feel less like exercising, and our weight is increasing. \u00a0 We have already started walking our way to cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\nAs you see , sugar is where it all starts, I mean disease.\nSugar causes irritation and weakening of the mucous membranes of the body and robs the teeth, bones and blood of a great percentage of their minerals. Inflammatory diseases of the breathing and digestive organs result from the use of brown and white sugar.\nIf , after reading those facts you feel to stop eating sugar , we are recommending next alternatives:\ndry fruit, fresh fruit, fresh fruit juice,\u00a0 resins, apple syrup, rice malt, barley malt.\nBut, do not just replace sugar with malt, or apple syrup.\u00a0 It is also important to generally decrease consumption of concentrated sweeteners. Eat more fresh fruit and compote.\nThe easiest way of decreasing consumption of sugar is by decreasing consumption of meat.\nHow to stop eating sugar ?\nThere is a balance between meat consumption and sugar.\nIf you eat meat, you need sugar, and visa versa. Serious trouble can happen if the balance is off which is easy since sugar is addictive, like a drug. If you are a vegetarian and eat mostly carbohydrates, the effect of extra sugar is heightened.\nOne of the major drawbacks is that sugar raises the insulin level, which inhibits the release of growth hormones, which in turn depresses the immune system. Not something you want to happen if you want to avoid sickness.\nAccording to Kathleen DesMaisons in her book Potatoes Not Prozac sugar sensitive people , those who have a more volatile reaction to the substance, usually have low levels of serotonin and low levels of beta endorphins.\nThe level of beta endorphins have a direct impact on a person\u2019s self esteem, tolerance for pain, sense of connectiveness and to the ability to take personal responsibility for action. It follows that with higher levels of beta endorphins the disease management process would be easier.\nWhen blood sugar spikes it signals the adrenal glands to release more adrenaline. This leads to adrenal fatigue and in turn makes blood sugar ups and downs ever more pronounced. Note this, for many of us have adrenals already fatigued from overeating of sugar.\nAccording to William Duffy in \"Sugar Blues\" the difference between sugar addiction and narcotic addiction is largely one of degree. Here are some suggestions to make the withdrawal easier:\nAs you are reducing the amount of sugar also reduce the amount of meat you are eating\nEat a bit of ginger before meals\nTaking Colloidal minerals that contain trace minerals\u00a0Chromium and Vanadium would solve problem of craving for Sugar and sweets !\nCraving for Sugar and sweets is a symptom of Chromium and Vanadium deficiency.\nDon\u2019t eat any concentrated sweetener for breakfast\nEat your breakfast as late as possible and start with fruit\nMake pause between fruit and other food\nNever eat fruit together with a rest of food\nMake treats like cookies sweetened with rice syrup (a honey like sweetener made from cultured rice) or barley malt\nGet to know some new foods that have a subtle sweet taste from natural sugars. Try manna bread (tastes like a muffin but is made only from sprouted grains) or oatmilk.\nGet to know more about the sugar/depression/energy connection. Read Food and Healing, Sugar Blues, or Potatoes Not Prozac\nMore about sugar:\nSugars are classified as either simple or complex carbohydrates. Refined sugars such as white, brown, and turbinado sugars, and the unrefined simple sugars, such as fruit sweeteners and concentrated fruit juices, are all simple carbohydrates. The grain syrups: barley malt and brown rice syrup, contain complex carbohydrates besides some simple sugars.\nComplex carbohydrates are a string of simple sugars (glucose) strung together that must be broken back down into simple sugars before they can be absorbed into the bloodstream; whereas simple sugars can go directly into the bloodstream.\nAn influx of sugar into the blood stream upsets the body's blood sugar balance, triggering the release of insulin, which the body uses to keep blood sugar at a safe and constant level. Insulin also promotes the storage of fat, so when you eat sweets high in sugar and fat, you're making way for rapid weight gain and elevated triglyceride levels, both of which have been linked to cardiovascular disease. Complex carbohydrates tend to be absorbed more slowly, lessening the impact on blood sugar levels.\nRefined sugars have been stripped of the vitamins, minerals, and fiber that were originally present before processing. White sugar is 99.9 percent sucrose, and brown and turbinado are 96 percent sucrose. Brown sugar is white sugar with molasses and/or caramel coloring added. Turbinado sugar, also called raw sugar, is slightly less refined and contains a trace amount of a few minerals.\nConsequently, consuming large amounts of refined sugars places an extra burden on the body to supply the nutrients, specifically the B vitamins, chromium, magnesium, and zinc, needed to convert glucose (blood sugar) into energy. According to USDA biochemist Richard Anderson, refined sugar may also impair the absorption of trace minerals like copper and chromium present in some of the other foods we have eaten.\nRefined simple sugars also have an impact on brain chemistry. They raise serotonin levels, which can leave you feeling drowsy. However, the unrefined simple fruit sweeteners have less impact on brain chemistry because they are high in the sugar fructose, which does not affect serotonin levels.\nChoosing natural sweeteners\u00a0 rich in complex carbohydrates and reading labels before buying a product will help you reduce your consumption of refined sugar. Natural sweeteners retain most of their vitamins and minerals, and many contain complex carbohydrates. Below is a list and brief description of some of the natural sweeteners available.\nNatural sweetener\n% complex carbohydrates in dry matter\n(good ones)\n% simple sugars in dry matter\n(bad ones)\nBrown Rice Syrup\u00a0 (Rice malt)\nis made from (yeast culture) fermented brown rice and sprouted whole barley. Like barley malt, it is ground and heated to make a thick syrup. Because of its mild taste, it can be used as a substitute for white or brown sugar.\nOK for sick people but not too much !\nIt is one of the best of all concentrated sweeteners !\nAvoid it if you have Candida Albicans (yeast) problem !\n40 % complex carbohydrates (starch)\n57 % maltose\nBarley Malt Syrup\nis made from (yeast culture) fermented whole barley which is sprouted to break down some of the carbohydrate into the simple sugar maltose. It is then ground and heated to make a thick syrup. Barley malt is a good substitute for brown and white sugar. It is delicious in hot breakfast cereals, cookies, breads, muffins, and recipes using carob.\nOK for sick people but not too much !\nIt is one of the best of all concentrated sweeteners !\nAvoid it if you have Candida Albicans (yeast) problem !\n33 % complex carbohydrates (starch)\n66 % maltose\nGranulated Brown Rice Sweeteners\nare made from dried brown rice syrup or a combination of dried brown rice syrup and powdered grape juice concentrate. Brown rice sweeteners have a very mild flavor and can be used to replace white or brown sugar in baked goods.\nOK for sick people but not too much !\nIt is good concentrated sweeteners !\nAvoid it if you have Candida Albicans (yeast) problem !\n33 % or more complex carbohydrates\n66 % maltose, fructose, glucose, and sucrose\nFruit Concentrate/Sweetener\nincludes frozen juice concentrates such as grape or apple juice and refrigerated jars of fruit concentrates which are typically blends of juices such as peach, pear, and pineapple juice. Fruit concentrates are thicker than fruit juice concentrates and are made by cooking whole fruits at very low temperatures until they have been reduced to a thick syrup. Fruit sweeteners work well in most baked goods.\nThey are not much better then white or brown sugar !!!\nIf you are sick, avoid it !!!\n1 %\n90 - 96 % simple sugars, fructose, glucose, and sucrose\nMaple Syrup\nis made from the sap of sugar maple trees. Thirty\u00adfive to 50 gallons of sap are boiled to produce one gallon of maple syrup. Grade A maple syrup has a lighter color and flavor than Grade B, which is darker with a stronger flavor.\nIt is not much better then white or brown sugar!!!\nI do not recommend it !!!\n1 %\n96 % sucrose\nHoney\nis a mixture of acid secretions from the glands of honeybees and nectar from flowers. Although honey is a natural sweetener, it is considered a refined sugar because 96% of dry matter are simple sugars: fructose, glucose and sucrose.\nIt is sweeter and higher in calories than refined white sugar. Honey does contain some B vitamins, minerals, and enzymes. However, the enzymes are generally destroyed by high heat causing the honey to lose nutritional properties when used in baking. God to use in special cures, but not as a every day food !\nIt is not much better then white or brown sugar!!!\nI do not recommend it !!!\n0 %\n96 % simple sugars, fructose, glucose, and sucrose\nGranulated Cane Juice\nis made from organically grown sugar cane juice that has been filtered and dehydrated. Its a simple sugar that tastes much like brown or turbinado sugar; however, its less refined and contains more vitamins and minerals. Granulated cane juice can be used as a substitute for both white and brown sugar, but it is still rich in sucrose.\nIt is not much better then white or brown sugar!!!\nI do not recommend it !!!\n0 %\n96 % sucrose\nMolasses\nis a by\u00adproduct of the refined white, brown, and turbinado sugars. Sweet molasses or light molasses is the liquid left after the first extraction of sugar crystals. Blackstrap molasses is the liquid left after the last extraction of sugar crystals, and has a stronger, bittersweet flavor and is richer in potassium, calcium, iron, and B\u00advitamins than sweet molasses.\u00a0\u00a0 Though molasses is better than white sugar, it still contain a lot of it, so I can not recommend eating molasses.\nIt is not much better then white or brown sugar!!!\nI do not recommend it !!!\n0 %\n"}, {"score": 1051.6167, "uuid": "d9f65f65-25aa-5b1b-924c-457a80d7d7e9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0704wb-81-23537", "target_hostname": "www.thesuperfoodco.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.thesuperfoodco.co.uk/stevia-extract-powder-50g-200300-x-sweeter-than-sugar-p-1303.html", "page_rank": 1.2117735e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Stevia Extract Powder - 50g (200-300 x sweeter <em>than</em> <em>sugar</em>) : www.TheSuperFoodCo.co.uk", "snippet": "When the stevia leaves <em>are</em> processed using pure and natural water the result is a snow-<em>white</em> powder called stevioside.

According to a report on Australia's national broadcaster ABC (28 June 2002), the herb can be taken in droplet form with meals, bringing blood glucose levels to \"near normal\". Users of stevia have also reported lower incidence of colds and flu. The herb can aid in weight loss by reducing appetite and can be used to suppress tobacco and alcohol cravings. This is because stevia leaf contains various vitamins and minerals including vitamins A and C, zinc, rutin, magnesium and iron.

The most economical and readily available is No. 1 blended Canadian, which comes pastuerized (this process kills yeasts and some bacteria) or non-pastuerized. Molasses varieties include blackstrap, which is produced during the refining of white sugar \u2013 look for the unsulfured grade.\u00a0This dark syrup has a pronounced taste and flavour, and is high in minerals, including iron. Barbados molasses comes from whole cane sugar, and is less sweet, with a fraction of the minerals.\u00a0Rice or barley syrups are produced by using enzymes to convert the starch into a sweet syrup.\u00a0Malt syrup is better tolerated by diabetics because it doesn\u2019t stimulate insulin production.\u00a0Maple syrup is limited as an inclusionary ingredient, but does provide excellent flavour profiles \u2013 both on its own, and with vanilla.\nThe use of sugar in daily breads and buns is totally unnecessary, other than to provide a cheap bread softener.\u00a0Many other ingredients are available that perform the same function.\u00a0Artificial sweeteners have no place in a yeast dough; common substitutes for sugar being lower levels of non-diastatic malt syrups or molasses which support yeast fermentation activity, and promote crust browning.\nFor white sugar to syrup recipe conversions, start at straight weight exchange, and reduce the liquids by 25 per cent \u2013 some minor adjustments may be required.\u00a0Because of their high humectancy, syrups will attract moisture and keep products soft for extended periods of time.\u00a0Caloric values will remain high, and other ingredients have to be introduced that mimic the tenderizing qualities of white sugar.\u00a0Consider resistant starches and gums, since they are readily available in small quantities, together with recommended uses.\nWhen we look at modern-day sugar substitutes, a different picture emerges \u2013 the choice beween polyalcohols and a chlorinated sugar or a\u00a0no-calorie sweetener, such as\u00a0SPLENDA\u00ae\u00a0Sucra-lose,\u00a0is a difficult one.\u00a0Formulating with substitutes at the retail level is error prone, and diagnosing how to fix inferior baked goods can be hit and miss.\u00a0When looking at a cookie form-ula with 20 to 25 per cent sucrose, the sugar not only acts as a bulking agent, but provides sweetness, colour and appropriate texture. These characteristics are essential, and must be maintained when a switch to artificial sweeteners is made. The public\u2019s reaction when seeing them on an ingredient declaration varies, depend on whether they are organic focused, just want to lose weight or are insulin dependent.\nAs a retail baker, most of my recipes combine two or three sugar substitutes, the easiest to source being SPLENDA\u00ae or SPLENDA\u00ae\u00a0Sucralose \u2013 artificial sweeteners which can be bought either commercially or from a local supermarket.\u00a0The others that I use most frequently include Maltitol and Xylitol, each bringing a specific function to the baked goods.\u00a0We use Maltitol in a straight one-to-one substitution in sponge cakes, and SPLENDA\u00ae\u00a0in cookies and muffins.\u00a0For many years, diabetics have used products sweetened with poly-alcohol sugars like Sorbitol, Xylitol, Maltitol, and Mannitol.

You may be diabetic, on a diet, or perhaps you have a sweet tooth that has overstayed its welcome. Either way, baking and cooking without sugar can sometimes seem like a daunting task. As you start to explore the world of sugar-free cooking, you will notice that many recipes do not really need sugar or that adding sugar makes little difference to the overall recipe. When sugar can\u2019t be avoided, try thinking outside of the box by using natural sweeteners or sugar substitutes.\nFirst of all, it\u2019s not a good idea, nor is it necessary, to completely cut sugar out of your diet all at once. You should reduce the amount of sugar you ingest gradually. A great way to start this is by cutting down on soda and sugary soft drinks. Most people will go to water with lemon, but if you crave something more, you can always use soda water (which has no sugar) and fruit juice mixed together as a substitute. Also, bake at home if you really must have some sweets and goodies, such as cookies and cakes, instead of buying them at a store or bakery. Even if you use real sugar, there will still be less than store or bakery-bought sweets.\nSecondly, using sugar substitutes can help you ease your transition or even replace your use of sugar. There are two categories of sweeteners \u2013 nutritive and nonnutritive. When you are learning to cook without sugar, it will be important for you to know about these two types of sugars.\nNutritive sweeteners provide energy and calories to your diet at four calories per gram, which is just like a carbohydrate or a protein. Nutritive sweeteners include white table sugar, brown table sugar, molasses, honey, maple syrup and corn syrup. Nutritive sweeteners contain glucose and fructose, either alone or together as sucrose. Sugar relatives, also known as sugar alcohols are another category of nutritive sweeteners \u2013 these sugar relatives usually come from fruits and dextrose. Most commonly, sugar alcohols include: mannitol, xylitol, maltitol and sorbitol. These sugar alcohols give energy to your body and can affect the glucose levels in your blood.\nNonnutritive sweeteners are called sugar substitutes and are classified as artificial sweeteners. Nonnutritive sweeteners do not have any calories and don\u2019t influence blood sugar levels. They usually include saccharin, aspartame, sucralose, acesulfame potassium and cyclamate.\nWhen you are looking to cut sugar out of your diet, you will want to look at replacing sugar in your cooking and baking with artificial sweeteners. Many artificial sweeteners don\u2019t react like sugar in baking. Sugar caramelizes when it is being cooked or baked, which can help with the fluff you see in cakes and cookies. Artificial sweeteners are more for sweetening flavor than being a part of the recipe.\nThe oldest of the artificial sweeteners is saccharin, which is available as a tabletop sweetener on the shelves of the grocery store and in tablet and powder form from pharmacies. Saccharin is 300 times sweeter than table sugar and has a metallic, bitter aftertaste to it.\nThere has been some controversy over the use of saccharin because it is allegedly related to cancer; however, numerous research studies have been unable to find any direct associations between saccharin and cancer.\nAspartame is marketed as \u0091NutraSweet\u2019 and \u0091Equal\u2019 and is commonly found in soft drinks, desserts, candy, and breakfast cereals. Aspartame is partially a nutritive sweetener, as it gives four calories per gram, however it is 200 times sweeter than table sugar and you only need a little bit to achieve sweetness. Aspartame is made up from two amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein; therefore, it is metabolized and digested the same way that protein foods are digested.\nCyclamate is marketed as \u0091Sucaryl\u2019 and is used in Sugar Twin and Weight Watchers. Cyclamate is 30 times sweeter than table sugar and leaves no aftertaste. This artificial sweeter is heat stable, which means it can be used in hot and cold foods, making it a prime candidate for sugar- free baking and cooking.\nSucralose is marketed as \u0091Splenda\u2019 and is made from sugar itself. Sucralose is 400 to 800 times sweeter than table sugar. Sucralose is heat stable, even at extreme heat (or cold) and can be used in a variety of hot drinks and pastries. Even though Sucralose is made from sugar and is close to the chemical structure of sugar, your body won\u2019t recognize it as sugar and has no effect on your insulin secretion or metabolism.\nAcesuflame Potassium, also known as AceK, is a recent nonnutritive sweetener and is currently marketed under the brand name Sunett. AceK can be found in fruit spreads, baked goods, table top sweeteners, gum, breath fresheners and hard candies, to name a few. 200 times sweeter than table sugar, it is also a great candidate when you want to cook without sugar.\nNonnutritive sweeteners can often not be substituted directly for sugar in recipes, however many manufactures have developed specialized recipes for the use of nonnutritive sweeteners. If you need to cut the sugar out of your diet completely, you can research for recipes that use an artificial sweetener instead of sugar. Many people have\ntest\ned and tried out new recipes that don\u2019t use sugar for sweetening or texture and have come up with ways to use other ingredients to make up for the lack of sugar, while adding the artificial sweetener instead for flavor only.\nSplenda maintains that it can be used directly in the place of sugar, and because it is made from sugar and maintains some of the structural integrity and chemical makeup of sugar, for most cases, Splenda, or Sucralose, can be used instead of sugar. Splenda also has a variety of recipes available that use the product instead of sugar, including cookies and cakes.\nIf you want to cook without sugar, this doesn\u2019t mean that you have to cut the sweetness out of your diet completely. Artificial sweeteners are\ntest\ned and tried and are found to be safe for consumption at this time. If you have a potassium limited diet, however, you should speak to your doctor before using some of the artificial sweeteners.\nWhen you go shopping, you will also have to learn to read labels to find products that are made using artificial sweeteners instead of sugar. You will want to avoid labels that have sucrose, fructose and glucose in them \u2013 these are nutritive and real sugars that add calories and affect your blood glucose levels. You will want to find products that are made with one of the non nutritive sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, sucralose, acesulfame potassium and cyclamate.\nFinding products that contain artificial sweeteners is not as difficult as it sounds, nor is cutting real sugar from your diet. The key to successfully decreasing your sugar intake is to do it slowly and gradually. Decrease the amount of sugar that you intake and the amount of artificial sweeteners that you increase. Immediately changing can cause upset problems with your digestive system, and you can \u0091sugar crash\u2019 or go through \u0091sugar withdrawals\u2019. Take your time and do it right, enjoying your new adventure of cooking without sugar.\nAre You a Health Food Nut?\nLentils. Fish. Nuts.

Once limited to the health-food market as an unapproved herb, the plant-derived sweetener known as stevia is now widely available and rapidly replacing artificial sweeteners in consumer products. Thirty times sweeter than sugar and with no effect on blood sugar and little aftertaste, stevia sales are predicted to reach about $700 million in the next few years, according to the agribusiness finance giant Rabobank.\nStevia\u2019s history goes back to ancient times. Grown naturally in tropical climates, stevia is an herb in the chrysanthemum family that grows wild as a small shrub in Paraguay and Brazil, though it can easily be cultivated elsewhere. Paraguayans have used stevia as a food sweetener for centuries while other countries, including Brazil, Korea, Japan, China and much of South America, have a shorter, though still long-standing, record of stevia use.\nStevia\u2019s Rocky History With the FDA\nThough widely available throughout the world, in 1991 stevia was banned in the U.S. due to early studies that suggested the sweetener may cause cancer. A follow-up study refuted the initial study and in 1995, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed stevia to be imported and sold as a food supplement, but not as a sweetener. Several companies argued to the FDA that stevia should be categorized similarly to its artificial-sweetener cousins as \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS). Substances that are considered GRAS have been determined to be safe through expert consensus, scientific review or widespread use without negative complications. They are exempt from the rigorous approval process required for food additives. If designated as GRAS, stevia could be used as a sweetener in a wide variety of food products and beverages. In December 2008, the FDA accepted this argument, declared stevia GRAS, and allowed its use in mainstream U.S. food production. It has taken food manufacturers a couple of years to work out the right formulations, but stevia is now present in a number of foods and beverages in the U.S., including Gatorade\u2019s G2, VitaminWater Zero, SoBe Lifewater Zero, Crystal Light and Sprite Green. Around the world it has been used in soft drinks, chewing gums, wines, yogurts, candies and many other products. Stevia powder can also be used for cooking and baking (in markedly decreased amounts compared to table sugar due to its high sweetness potency).\nIn its initial form, Stevia was sold as a ground-up powder of the stevia plant leaves. Though sweet, the powder also had a bitter aftertaste (mostly attributed to a compound found in the stevia plant called stevioside), which limited its acceptability as a sugar substitute for the health-store-shopping crowd. But now manufacturers have figured out how to retain the sweet taste and all of stevia\u2019s benefits without the aftertaste. There are more than 100 species of stevia plant, but one stands out for its excellent properties as a sweetener\u2014stevia rebaudiana, which contains the compound rebaudioside A, the sweetest-flavored component of the stevia leaf. Rebaudioside A acts chemically similar to sugar in onset, intensity and duration of sweetness, and is free of aftertaste. A majority of stevia-sweetened products contain mostly extracted Rebaudioside A with some proportion of stevioside, which is a white crystalline compound present in stevia that tastes 100 to 300 times sweeter than table sugar.\nStevia is marketed under the trade names of Truvia (Coca-Cola and agricultural giant Cargill), PureVia (PepsiCo and Whole Earth Sweetener Company), and SweetLeaf (Wisdom Natural Brands). Despite the three different names, the sweetener is essentially the same product, each containing slightly different proportions of rebaudioside A and stevioside. Both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo intend to use stevia as a soft-drink sweetener in the U.S., but haven\u2019t yet unveiled their stevia-sweetened versions of Coke or Pepsi.\nBut is it Safe?\nThough stevia is most likely as safe as artificial sweeteners (or more so), few long-term studies have been done to document its health effects in humans. A review conducted by toxicologists at UCLA, which was commissioned by nutrition advocate Center for Science in the Public Interest ( Kobylewski & Eckhert, 2008 ), raised concerns that stevia could contribute to cancer. The authors noted that in some test tube and animal studies, stevioside (but not rebaudioside A) caused genetic mutations, chromosome damage and DNA breakage. These changes presumably could contribute to malignancy, though no one has actually studied if these compounds cause cancer in animal models. Notably, initial concerns that stevia may reduce fertility or worsen diabetes seem to have been put to rest after a few good studies showed no negative outcomes. In fact, one study of human subjects showed that treatment with stevia may improve glucose tolerance. Another found that stevia may induce the pancreas to release insulin, thus potentially serving as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. ( These studies are reviewed in Goyal, Samsher and Goyal, 2010. ) After artificial sweeteners were banned in Japan more than 40 years ago, the Japanese began to sweeten their foods with stevia. And while they have conducted more than 40,000 clinical studies on stevia and concluded that it is safe for human use, there is a general lack of long-term studies on stevia\u2019s use and effects.\nAll in all, stevia\u2019s sweet taste and all-natural origins make it a popular sugar substitute. With little long-term outcomes data available on the plant extract, it is possible that stevia in large quantities could have harmful effects. However, it seems safe to say that when consumed in reasonable amounts, stevia may be an exceptional natural plant-based sugar substitute. Check the label next time you eat a favorite low-calorie sweet. You\u2019re likely to find stevia near the top of the ingredient list.\nReferences\nGoyal, S.K., Samsher and Goyal, R.K. (2010).

Today we know that the peaks of insulin and the secretion of IGF directly stimulate not only the growth of cancer cells but also their capacity to invade neighboring tissues.\"\n-David Servan-Schreiber, MD, PhD, Anticancer\nWhat are other potential health effects from sugar?\nCreates acidity\nUses the body's store of vitamins and minerals without providing any in return\nContributes to mental disorders\nReacts with proteins and forms little crusts or plaques called AGEs (advanced glycation end production)\nWhat else should I know about sugar?\nThe average American eats over 158 pounds of sugar annually, or about 50 teaspoons daily2.\nSugar consumption in the United States increased by 30 percent from 1983 to 19993.\nHigh Fructose Corn Syrup\nWhat is high fructose corn syrup?\nHigh fructose corn syrup is made by processing cornstarch to fructose and then adding it to pure corn syrup.\nWhat foods contain high fructose corn syrup?\nHigh fructose corn syrup is found in many canned foods, soft drinks, cookies, salad dressings, condiments, yogurts, soups, and other foods.

For these posts, I purposefully chose not to get all educational on you, and instead, focus on real, everyday ideas and solutions!\n(But, do look at the bottom of the post for more educational resources and links)\n21 Ways to Eat Less Sugar\nImage by yogma\nUse Better Sweeteners\nReplace your white or brown sugar with an unrefined, dehydrated sugar, like Sucanat or Rapadura. Yes, it's still sugar but that one change still makes a difference by somewhat reducing the dramatic blood sugar effect, giving your body at least a few nutrients in the process, and avoiding the high temperature and chemical process used to create regular sugar.\nUse fruit as a sweetener. Substitute some of the sugar and liquids in a recipe with ripe bananas, apple sauce, pineapple, or other fruit puree. Dried fruits like dates, raisins and figs add wonderful sweetness to foods.\nTry Stevia. This herb, originally from South America, is extremely sweet by nature but without any calories or sugar-like effects on the body, and you can use as little as a couple drops to sweeten a mug of tea or a few teaspoons in a dessert. It does have a somewhat bitter aftertaste, depending on the type you use. Unrefined foods are always best, and you can buy Stevia as a simple dried powder. Personally, we use this sometimes, but my husband only likes a particular brand of Stevia with absolutely no aftertaste (NuNaturals liquid). It is refined, but it works for us.\nUse raw honey. Although it is still a sweetener and can be overused like anything, raw honey is full of nutrients, enzymes, and actually has many healing properties. It is lower glycemically than sugar, and many people who react to sugar strongly can eat honey without issue.\nImage by Siona Watson\nReplacing Sweets with Healthier Treats\nReplace \"like with like\". This is a common phrase you'll hear from me, because I believe that we make the transition to healthier choices easier when we find better alternatives that are similar to things we already like. This is an old post with a bunch of sweet tooth ideas that are just a little bit different .\nLearn to use fruit as a dessert. In North America we have a tendency to make our desserts very sugar, grain and dairy focused (and don't forget the chocolate). But in many other parts of the world, fruits have a starring role in treats. Think fruit crumbles or cobblers, lightly poached peaches, homemade apple sauce, fresh berries with cream, fruit salad, or fruit smoothies. One of my very favorite desserts is simply peeled and sliced pears, fried lightly in a pan with just a bit of water, a sprinkle of cinnamon and some toasted nuts, especially pine nuts. It's surprisingly fantastic!\nChoose savory grains instead of sweetened ones. Sometimes a lovely slice of warm bread and butter can satisfy as much as a sweet treat. Yes, it is made with grains which are still carbohydrates, but the effect on our body is so much better.\nUse Less Sugar in General\nCut back on the sugar in your recipes. Start to cut back just a bit, perhaps 1/5 or 1/6 the amount, then 1/4, 1/3, even 1/2. See at which point you really start to notice a difference. Over time, you will likely find that you enjoy the less-sweetened version!\nBe purposeful about cutting meals out of your regular routine that include sugar. If you usually eat a lot of pancakes with syrup, or muffins, or even things like sweetened baked beans, try cutting out one or more of those meals each week. Substitute with something more protein or veggie based instead.\nTry Stevia as a sugar replacement in your drinks. I think that sweetened beverages are one of the places where we consume the most sugar, in the most un-conscious way. Just replacing the sugar in your drinks with Stevia can cut down your sugar intake more than you might think. It's great in hot drinks like coffee or tea, as well as for making lemonade or limeade, in iced teas, etc.\nTry other more complex flavors instead of just going with something sweet. Add fresh or frozen fruit, nuts, coconut, etc. to your oatmeal instead of just honey or brown sugar. Play around with various fresh fruits to add more natural sweetness to smoothies. Use nut butters and a sprinkle of cinnamon instead of jam on toast.\nMake sourdough bread instead of bread that uses honey or sugar. It tastes amazing, is so cheap to make, and is just as satisfying (check out the Sourdough eCourse that I am currently reviewing- it's so helpful!)\nImage by Matthew F\nDealing with Social Situations and Celebrations\nFill up on a really good dinner or wholesome snack, BEFORE you leave the house. If you're less hungry, you'll be less tempted.\nIf you are truly attempting to stop eating sugar altogether, mention to your hosts beforehand (if it's an appropriate situation to do so) that they needn't prepare any desserts or sweet treats, because you are trying to stay off of them.\nOffer to bring something that you know you'll feel good about eating, like a fruit or veggie platter, some hummus and bread, deviled eggs, chips and salsa, etc. Others will likely appreciate a non-sweet item in the mix. I am always pleased at church functions when I see that the savory treats or the bowl of mandarins are the most popular in the midst of the brownies, cookies and bars.\nHave a special treat waiting for yourself at home when you know that you will be somewhere with no sugar-free alternatives. Instead of feeling tempted all night, you'll feel better knowing that something yummy awaits you.\nAllow yourself a small piece of something, or just choose one item that looks the very best. Savor that one thing slowly, and really enjoy it, even if others around you have a plateful.\nWill Power and Mind Games :)\nHave treat days, where you can \"cheat\" and have a splurge food. It's easier to go sugar-free for several days knowing that on Friday, you can indulge without guilt. Try having several cheat days each week at first, then down to only one, and ultimately limit yourself to only sweet alternatives except in very special situations.\nSimply go cold turkey and force yourself to find other options when you're feeling hungry or snackish. Personally, I like going cold turkey, because there's absolutely no room for compromise; I simply can't have it. For others, this is sheer torture and will cause them to cave, so it's not the right strategy for everyone.\nIn tough situations, remind yourself of the reasons you are doing this. It may help to write them on an index card and put it on your fridge, or perhaps keep it in your wallet.\nBrush your teeth right after eating a meal, so that you won't be tempted to eat something sugary and have to go and brush your teeth again.\nFurther Resources:\nAt Tiffany's Table- This is a book I got this spring, trading my Real Food on a Real Budget for a copy of Tiffany Perez' wonderful real food cookbook .

Naturally occurring sugars are found naturally in foods such as fruit (fructose) and milk (lactose). Added sugars are sugars and syrups put in foods during preparation or processing, or added at the table.\nFoods Containing Added Sugars\nThe major sources of added sugars are regular soft drinks, sugars, candy, cakes, cookies, pies and fruit drinks (fruitades and fruit punch); dairy desserts and milk products (ice cream, sweetened yogurt and sweetened milk); and other grains (cinnamon toast and honey-nut waffles).\nToo much sugar isn't so sweet for your health\nMany people consume more sugar than they realize. It\u2019s important to be aware of how much sugar you consume because our bodies don\u2019t need sugar to function properly. Added sugars contribute zero nutrients but many added calories that can lead to extra pounds or even obesity, thereby reducing heart health.\nIf you think of your daily calorie needs as a budget, you want to \u201cspend\u201d most of your calories on \u201cessentials\u201d to meet your nutrient needs. Use only left over, discretionary calories for \u201cextras\u201d that provide little or no nutritional benefit, such as sugar.\nThe hidden ingredient with many different names\nTo figure out if a packaged food contains added sugars, and how much, you have to be a bit of a detective. On the Nutrition Facts panel, the line for sugars contains both the natural and added types as total grams of sugar. There are four calories in each gram, so if a product has 15 grams of sugar per serving, that\u2019s 60 calories just from the sugar alone, not counting the other ingredients.\nTo tell if a processed food contains added sugars, you need to look at the list of ingredients. Sugar has many other names. Besides those ending in \u201cose,\u201d such as maltose or sucrose, other names for sugar include high fructose corn syrup, molasses, cane sugar, corn sweetener, raw sugar, syrup, honey or fruit juice concentrates. Check here for more information about reading food labels.\nLimit your consumption of foods with high amounts of added sugars, such as sugar-sweetened beverages. Just one 12-ounce can of regular soda contains eight teaspoons of sugar, or 130 calories and zero nutrition.\nHow much is just right?\nThe American Heart Association\u00a0(AHA) recommends limiting the amount of added sugars you consume to no more than half of your daily discretionary calories allowance. For most American women, that\u2019s no more than 100 calories per day, or about 6 teaspoons of sugar. For men, it\u2019s 150 calories per day, or about 9 teaspoons. The AHA recommendations focus on all added sugars, without singling out any particular types such as high-fructose corn syrup.\u00a0 For more detailed information and guidance on sugar intake limits, see the scientific statement in the August 2009 issue of Circulation, Journal of the American Heart Association.\nTips for Reducing Sugar in Your Diet:\nTake sugar (white and brown), syrup, honey and molasses off the table \u2014 out of sight, out of mind!\nCut back on the amount of sugar added to things you eat or drink regularly like cereal, pancakes, coffee or tea. Try cutting the usual amount of sugar you add by half and wean down from there, or consider using an artificial sweetener.\nBuy sugar-free or low-calorie beverages.\nBuy fresh fruits or fruits canned in water or natural juice. Avoid fruit canned in syrup, especially heavy syrup.\nInstead of adding sugar to cereal or oatmeal, add fresh fruit (try bananas, cherries or strawberries) or dried fruit (raisins, cranberries or apricots).\nWhen baking cookies, brownies or cakes, cut the sugar called for in your recipe by one-third to one-half. Often you won\u2019t notice the difference.\nInstead of adding sugar in recipes, use extracts such as almond, vanilla, orange or lemon.\nEnhance foods with spices instead of sugar; try ginger, allspice, cinnamon or nutmeg.\nSubstitute unsweetened applesauce for sugar in recipes (use equal amounts).\nTry non-nutritive sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose or saccharin in moderation. Non-nutritive sweeteners may be a way to satisfy your sweet tooth without adding more calories to your diet. The FDA has determined that non-nutritive sweeteners are safe.\nHealthy Diet Goals\n"}, {"score": 998.6647, "uuid": "058d2629-1024-5078-aafb-01e80f87e976", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0809wb-97-25780", "target_hostname": "www.heart.org", "target_uri": "http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyDietGoals/Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Sugar_UCM_306725_Article.jsp", "page_rank": 1.3159718e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "Frequently Asked Questions About <em>Sugar</em>", "snippet": "Added <em>sugars</em> (or added <em>sweeteners</em>) include natural <em>sugars</em> (such as <em>white</em> <em>sugar</em>, brown <em>sugar</em> and honey) as well as other caloric <em>sweeteners</em> that <em>are</em> chemically manufactured (such as high fructose corn syrup).

It will be important for policy makers, the food industry and other public health groups to create dialogue regarding how to make assessing added sugars simpler for consumers.\nHow can I tell by looking at a Nutrition Facts panel if a product has added sugars?\nCurrent nutrition labels don\u2019t list the amount of added sugars (alone) in a product.\nThe line for \u201csugars\u201d you see on a nutrition label includes both added and naturally occurring sugars in the product. Naturally occurring sugars are found in milk (lactose) and fruit (fructose). Any product that contains milk (such as yogurt, milk, cream) or fruit (fresh, dried) contains some natural sugars.\nBut you can read the ingredient list on a processed food\u2019s label to tell if the product contains added sugars. Names for added sugars on labels include:\nBrown sugar\nSugar molecules ending in \u201cose\u201d (dextrose, fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, sucrose)\nHigh-fructose corn syrup\nWhat are added sugars?\nAdded sugars are sugars and syrups that are added to foods or beverages during processing or preparation. They do not include naturally occurring sugars such as those found in milk (lactose) and fruits (fructose).\nAdded sugars (or added sweeteners) include natural sugars (such as white sugar, brown sugar and honey) as well as other caloric sweeteners that are chemically manufactured (such as high fructose corn syrup).\nWhat is the difference between added sugars and naturally occurring sugars? Simple and complex carbohydrates?\nAdded sugars include any sugars, or caloric sweeteners that are added to a food during processing. Naturally occurring sugars are found naturally in foods such as fruit (fructose) and milk (lactose).\nAll carbohydrates are made up of units of sugar (\"saccharride\"). Carbohydrates containing only one unit of sugar (called \"monosaccharides\") or two units of sugar (called \"disaccharides\") are known as simple sugars or simple carbohydrates.\nSimple sugars are quickly broken down and provide a very fast increase in blood sugar, while complex carbs take longer and cause blood sugar to rise more gradually.\nComplex carbohydrates are found in foods such as starchy vegetables (corn, potatoes, peas, etc.) breads, cereals, rice and grains. Complex carbs are broken down into the simple sugars during digestion, which causes them to be processed more slowly in the body.\nWhat does the AHA recommend as a limit for daily added sugars intake?\nYour daily discretionary calorie allowance consists of calories available after meeting nutrient needs\u2014these calories don\u2019t contribute to weight gain. The American Heart Association recommends that no more than half of your daily discretionary calorie allowance come from added sugars. For most American women, this is no more than 100 calories per day and no more than 150 per day for men (or about 6 teaspoons a day for women and 9 teaspoons a day for men).\nSugar\u2019s primary role in the body is to provide energy (calories). To get the nutrients you need, eat a diet that\u2019s rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, fish, poultry and low-fat or fat-free dairy products. Typically, foods high in added sugars do not have the nutrients the body needs and only contain extra calories.\nHow much added sugars do most Americans consume?\nA report from the 2001\u201304 NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) database showed that Americans get about 22.2 teaspoons of sugar a day or about 355 calories. This number has increased steadily over the past three decades. Teens and men consume the most added sugars.\nA major contributor of added sugars to American diets are soft drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages.\nWhat are discretionary calories?\nYou have a daily energy need\u2014the amount of calories (or energy units) your body needs to function and provide energy for your activities. Think of it as a budget. You\u2019d organize a real budget with \u201cessentials\u201d (for example, rent and utilities) and \u201cextras\u201d (for example, vacation and entertainment). In a daily calorie budget, the essentials are the minimum number of calories you need to meet your nutrient needs.\nSelect low-fat and no-sugar-added foods to make good \u201cbuys\u201d with your budget. Depending on the foods you choose and the amount of physical activity you do each day, you may have more calories left over for \u201cextras\u201d that can be used on treats like solid fats, added sugars and alcohol. These are discretionary calories, or calories to be spent at your discretion.\nA person\u2019s discretionary calorie budget varies depending on how physically active they are and how many calories they need to consume to meet their daily nutrient requirements.\nHow are the remaining discretionary calories consumed if not as added sugars?\nDiscretionary calories are in addition to those that supply the nutrients to your body for daily function and activity. Your body does not actually need them to function. Common sources of discretionary calories (in addition to added sugars) are fats, oils and alcohol. Fats are the most concentrated source of calories.\nDiscretionary calories can be used to:\nEat additional foods from a food group above your daily recommendation.\nSelect a higher-calorie form of a food that\u2019s higher in fat or contains added sugars (whole milk vs. skim milk or sweetened vs. unsweetened cereal).\nAdd fats or sweeteners to the leanest versions of foods (for example, sauce, dressing, butter/margarine).\nEat or drink items that are mostly fat, sugar or alcohol such as candy, cake, beer, wine or regular soda.\nWhat is energy density and how do added sugars affect it?\nEnergy density refers to the number of calories (or amount of energy) per serving of a food. Because sugars contain calories (one teaspoon of white sugar has about 16 calories), the more sugar in a food, the more calories, or energy, that food will have.\nA similar-sounding term, nutrient density, refers to the amount of nutrients per serving of a food (nutrients are materials a body needs to function healthfully\u2014for example, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals). Foods that are highly nutrient-dense are good for your body. Ideal foods are low in energy density (calories) but highly nutrient-dense. Foods that are lacking in nutrients are often referred to as \u201cempty calories.\u201d\nBecause added sugars contain calories but no nutrients, they are energy-dense and nutrient-poor.\nTo improve the overall quality of Americans\u2019 diets, the American Heart Association recommends people consume foods with more nutrients and less calories.\n"}, {"score": 995.76996, "uuid": "67f7576f-4e57-5cbc-8147-268cd017f0e4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-12-13226", "target_hostname": "www.miamiherald.com", "target_uri": "http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/04/16/2751659/can-you-avoid-added-sweeteners.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "Can you avoid added <em>sweeteners</em> for one week?", "snippet": "So what <em>better</em> way to learn how to reduce your consumption of <em>sweeteners</em> <em>than</em> to completely avoid them for a few days?", "explanation": null, "document": "Can you avoid added sweeteners for one week?\nBy LISA LEAKE\nBy LISA LEAKE\nwww.100daysofrealfood.com\nNote to reader: This column addresses the \"100 Days of Real Food\" mini-pledge series, which details 14 weekly steps for cutting out highly processed food.\nLet's face it ... our society is obsessed with all things sweet. Which is why I have a feeling this might be the most difficult \"real food\" mini-pledge of them all. And even if you only join us for a day or two instead of the entire week, I promise it will still be an eye-opening experience proving just how sugar-laden packaged foods really are. And I am not just referring to white sugar and other refined sweeteners, which we already tackled a few weeks ago. I am talking about all added sweeteners even including honey and maple syrup. As I've said a thousand times before, no matter what sweetener you chose (natural, organic, raw, etc.) \"sugar is sugar,\" and it should always be used in moderation. So what better way to learn how to reduce your consumption of sweeteners than to completely avoid them for a few days?\nMini-Pledge Week 12: Avoid all added sweeteners including, but not limited to: white sugar, brown sugar, raw sugar, honey, maple syrup, date sugar, maple sugar, sucanat, splenda, stevia, agave, fruit juice concentrate, corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, brown rice syrup and cane juice.\nNothing sums up the sugar problem our society faces better than these startling facts from the recent \"Is sugar toxic?\" 60 Minutes news report:\n\"Americans are now consuming nearly 130 pounds of added sugars per person, per year. ... Dr. Robert Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California, believes the high amount of sugar in the American diet, much of it in processed foods, is killing us. And as Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports, new scientific research seems to support his theory that sugar is toxic, including some linking the excess ingestion of sugars to heart disease. (To reduce heart disease) a government commission in the 1970s mandated that we lower our fat consumption. 'When you take the fat out of food, it tastes like cardboard,' says Dr. Lustig. 'And the food industry knew that, so they replaced it with sugar ... and guess what? Heart disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and death are skyrocketing.'\"\nIt blows my mind when I am looking through cookbooks and I see recipe after recipe calling for a tablespoon or even a teaspoon of sugar in things like pancakes, soups, and sauces ... is such a small amount even necessary? And then at the supermarket product after product, even savory items like bread and crackers, can't seem to make it on the shelves without being sweetened as well. And I admit I am just as guilty as the next person with my big ol' sweet tooth, although my taste buds have definitely changed - for the better - since taking our \"100 Days of Real Food\" pledge. Abstaining from highly processed junk food really gave our palates an adjustment, and now just a little bit of sweetness seems to go a long way.\nSo this week it's time to put you to the test - even if it's only for a couple days.

The average American has 140 to 150 pounds of sugar per person of sugar added to their diets each year. Another 20 percent of our calories come from white flour, a simple carbohydrate, which acts a lot like sugar in our bodies. Eating almost twice our weight in sugar and white flour each year, it\u2019s not surprising that we have become a nation of sugar addicts. Like many other addictive substances, sugar may leave you feeling a bit better for a few hours, but then wreaks havoc on your body. For thousands of years, humans ate sugar found naturally in their food. Sugar was not a problem; it was a treat. But now many of the calories we consume come from sugar and white flour added by food processing. Our bodies simply were not designed to handle this massive load. The more food is processed, the less healthy it becomes. Processing food removes nutrients, minerals, and fiber. Sugar gives you an initial high and then you crash several hours later, leaving you wanting more sugar. In fact, sugar acts as an energy loan shark, taking away more energy than it gives. Eventually, your \u201ccredit line\u201d runs out and you find yourself exhausted, anxious, and moody.In addition to the immediate fatigue and emotional problems, sugar also causes many long-term health problems.\u00a0 Our consumption of high-fructose corn syrup has risen 250 percent in the past fifteen years, and our rate of diabetes has increased approximately 45 percent during the same time period. Although the sugar industry sometimes tries to confuse the public by claiming that corn syrup is not sugar, it is a form of sugar as far as your body is concerned, and more toxic. There are several chronic medical problems associated with excess sugar in our diet including: weight gain, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, chronic sinusitis, irritable bowel syndrome and spastic colon, cancer, metabolic syndrome with high cholesterol and hypertension, heart disease and stroke, ADHD, and anxiety/depression.\u00a0 Sugar is a mood-altering substance, which is no surprise to anyone with a sweet tooth. But the fact is that sugar is everywhere in our diet, and it is dumped into what we eat and drink during food processing. With one-third of our calories coming from sugar and white flour, and the stress of modern life increasing, we are seeing the makings of the perfect storm of medical problems. Eating sugar causes blood sugar to surge, insulin levels to spike, and fat to get deposited throughout your body. Obesity, often accompanied by diabetes and heart disease, is just one more consequence of our high-sugar diet. Your long-term goal should be to slowly decrease the sugar and simple carbohydrates (white flour, white rice, ect.) in your diet. Do not try to stop cold turkey as you may get withdrawal symptoms, just like stopping other drugs. Replace simple sugars with whole grains. You know a whole grain because it will contain a fair amount of fiber. The more fiber the better. Eat more fruit to satisfy your sweet tooth. Artificial sweeteners are just as bad and can have many side effects. Try Stevia instead. Stevia is a South American herb which has been used as a natural sweetener for centuries. The leaves of the Stevia rebaudiana plant have a refreshing taste, zero glycemic index, zerocalories and zerocarbs. It is 25-30 times sweeter than sugar, and far more healthy. There have not been any reports of toxicity with Stevia, which is consumed by millions of people daily.\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 966.5696, "uuid": "29094f02-c68a-5432-b5ce-bc1a6e468b75", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0510wb-44-01642", "target_hostname": "www.mhp.gov.on.ca", "target_uri": "http://www.mhp.gov.on.ca/en/healthy-ontario/healthy-eating/truth-about-sugar.asp", "page_rank": 1.1766249e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "The Truth About <em>Sugar</em> - Healthy Ontario", "snippet": "Brown <em>sugar</em> is usually <em>white</em> <em>sugar</em> with molasses added to the <em>sugar</em> crystals. * Honey is not <em>better</em> for you <em>than</em> <em>white</em> <em>sugar</em>.

It also alters gut barrier function. All in all, this may help explain the pronounced increase in IBD in Canada since its introduction into the food supply.\nBelieve me, if you keep destroying up to half of your gut flora by regularly consuming Splenda, then poor health is virtually guaranteed! Making matters worse, most people are already deficient in healthy bacteria due to excessive consumption of highly processed foods, which is why a high quality probiotic supplement is a good idea for most people. If you add sucralose to an already unbalanced intestinal tract, health problems are very likely to ensue\u2026\nThe Signs and Symptoms of Sucralose Toxicity\nI have done a fair level of literature review on this as I invested several years with four other professionals to write\u00a0the definitive work on Splenda, which was published\u00a0by Putnam in 2006.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that despite its misleading slogan, Splenda (sucralose) is nothing like sugar. Rather it\u2019s a chlorinated artificial sweetener in line with aspartame and saccharin, and with detrimental health effects to match. In fact, while sucralose starts out as a sugar molecule, by the time the manufacturing process is completed, it\u00a0more closely resembles DDT than sugar.\nIt could easily be likened to eating an insecticide\u2026\nUnfortunately, many fail to connect the dots between their symptoms and their use of Splenda, or other artificial sweeteners. I recommend reading through\u00a0the first-hand accounts of my readers, at least one of whom say that Splenda is \u201cworse than chemical warfare\u201d based on the adverse effects she suffered before she figured out the cause. Just as with aspartame, many Splenda users complain of general malaise or \u201cfeeling under the weather,\u201d along with a variety of neurological changes, such as foggy-headedness, lack of concentration, and \u201cbad mood.\u201d\nCommonly reported symptoms (usually experienced within 24 hours after consuming Splenda) include:\nIf you experience any of these symptoms and have just consumed Splenda, or consume it on a regular basis, I strongly recommend carefully avoiding any further exposure for a few days to a few weeks to see if the symptoms disappear. If they do, you may just have solved your own \u201chealth mystery.\u201d Likewise, if you have irritable bowel disease and consume any kind of Splenda product or other artificial sweetener, you\u2019d be wise to avoid such items in order to improve your condition.\nI believe it\u2019s important to identify the culprit, as the long-term damage of Splenda consumption is largely unknown. Still, it would probably be a fair guess that long-term exposure is not going to be beneficial to your health\u2014especially if you\u2019re having symptoms of toxicity! It\u2019s a sad reality that very few appropriate studies have been performed on Splenda. The vast majority of the studies that formed the basis for its approval in the US were done on animals, and they actually found plenty of problems even though they were ultimately dismissed, including:\nBrain lesions\nDecreased red blood cell count and anemia\nEnlarged and calcified kidneys\n"}, {"score": 950.831, "uuid": "bca3fe23-ed45-583b-aabc-486d0718c7e5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0406wb-90-23823", "target_hostname": "www.afpafitness.com", "target_uri": "http://www.afpafitness.com/articles/articles-and-newletters/research-articles-index/alternative-complementary-medicine-topics/sugar-substitutes-white-poison-in-the-pink-blue-packets-2/", "page_rank": 1.2248964e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "AFPA Articles and Newsletters \u00bb <em>Sugar</em> Substitutes: <em>White</em> Poison In The", "snippet": "That implies that, in aggregate, <em>artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em> <em>are</em> not acting as <em>sugar</em> substitutes but merely as supplements to <em>sugar</em> consumption.", "explanation": null, "document": "Sugar Substitutes: White Poison In The Pink & Blue Packets\nBy: Mark J. Occhipinti, M.S., Ph.D., N.D.c\nMany individuals, in an attempt to avoid sugar, use sugar substitutes. Aspartame a chemical compound found in products such as NutraSweet\u00ae and Equal\u00ae, are in over 3,000 foods, including Crystal Lite\u00ae, diet soda, diet foods, and other drinks that are consumed heavily in the fitness industry.\nJust about any food that once had sugar as an ingredient now can have aspartame instead. Aspartame is a combination of three substances: the amino acid phenylalanine, Aspartic acid (man made) and methanol (wood alcohol). Each of these ingredients have a long history of causing serious physical side effects. Phenylalanine, for example, lowers or blocks production of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which sends messages from the pineal gland in the brain.\nThis blockage has been linked a one cause of carbohydrate cravings, PMS symptoms, insomnia, mood swings, and migraine headaches. Aspartame removes the essential mineral chromium from the body, which is necessary in regulating the clearance of glucose from the blood while assisting insulin\u2019 s capability for glucose regulation. Sudden weight gains, water retention and flu like symptoms have been observed in fitness people, especially in aerobic instructors. A classic example was an article in the Sept. 1991 issue of Idea Today. Aerobic instructors and other fitness participants that consume diet beverages after exercise are at risk for absorbing high levels of methanol.\nDrinking between 1-3 12 ounce cans or glasses of diet beverage that contains aspartame on a hot day after exercise can expose you to 8 times the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s recommended safe limit for methanol. It has been found that methanol (free-form wood alcohol) can race through the system of a highly fit individual due to their high metabolic rate. Aspartame is not the answer to the high sugar consumption in \u2018America today.\nActually the increased intake of aspartame over the past twenty-five years since it\u2019s FDA approval are correlated with higher intake of sugar (over 150 pounds per year) and associated states of degenerative diseases that rack our country. Aspartame ranks number one for over a decade with complaints received by the FDA, representing over 85 percent of all complaints received yearly. There are over 73 symptoms associated directly to the use of aspartame, including dizziness, headaches, loss of equilibrium, ear problems, hemorrhaging of the eyes, and visual impairment. The dangers associated with aspartame are so widespread, that a report by 60 Minutes and Hard Copy in February 1997 illustrated the dangers and how the drug company who manufactures aspartame lied in the Senate Subcommittee Hearings both initially in 1973 and again in 1991.\nThere is an excellent source of research information on aspartame: Aspartame Consumer Safety Network (ACSN) in Dallas, TX. (214) 352-4268.\nThree Senate hearings have been conducted on the safety of aspartame, and the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) in Washington, D.C. now list aspartame as the third-worst food additive of all time. Authors Jean Carper and Ann Louise Gittleman state we have no idea how much we are actually consuming during the course of one day if diet foods and diet drinks are being consumed. There is no safe level of Aspartame since it was originally classified by the Department of Defense as a neuro-excitatory toxin, and it is a cumulative effect in the body. Isn\u2019t it interesting that the consumption of Aspartame has correlated with the increase in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other neurological diseases during the past twenty-five years?\nThis article was written based partially on the evidence presented in these studies/medical and scientific texts:\nBibliography\n1.

One died after 300 days of (Aspartame) from here on referred to as \u201cASP\u201d, and five others had grand mal seizures. Searle deleted this negative study when the company submitted safety evidence to the FDA.\n1970 - The FDA banned cyclamate during the time that the safety of saccharin was being questioned. The time seemed ripe for ASP.\n1971 - Dr. John Olney, a research psychiatrist, told Searle that Aspartic acid caused \u201choles in the brains of mice.\u201d\n1974 - Searle people said these studies raised \u201cno health problems.\u201d Searle told the FDA about these findings after approval was granted.\n1975 - Many of the test animals fed ASP developed large TUMORS. These were NOT reported to the FDA.\n1977 - Despite the many complaints about ASP, William Conlon and Thomas Sullivan, the US attorneys, took no action, in five years the statute of limitations for a grand jury investigation expired. A year later Conlon took a position with the law firm that represents Searle. (U.S. Attorney, Samuel Skinner did the same and ended up Chief of Staff in Bush\u2019s White House. ed.)\n1980 - A Public Board of Inquiry of three scientists was activated. These (2 MDs and one Ph.D.) voted to ban ASP. Because of those negative findings a five member Commissioner\u2019s Team of Scientists was impaneled: Three said ban; two said it was safe. Another member was added. You guessed it: deadlock. Dr. Jacqueline Verrett, Ph.D., toxicologist on the team said, \u201cBureau officials were working up to a whitewash. Safety questions remain unanswered.\u201d\n1981 - Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes, Jr. was appointed the new FDA Commissioner and overruled the Public Board of Inquiry\u2019s recommended ban of ASP. He said his approval was part of the Reagan administration\u2019s new reform! Throughout the 1980\u2019s Searle has pointed out that the best evidence of ASP\u2019s safety was the fact that it had been approved in more than 60 countries. But these foreign approvals had been based on these controversial test, and the questionable approval of the FDA. It was approved as a \u201cfood additive,\u201d and hence, exempt from continued safety monitoring. (Searle is not obligated to monitor any adverse reactions.)\n1983 - THE NATIONAL SOFT DRINK ASSOCIATION wrote to the FDA that ASP was breaking down in warm climates. But the Association later accepted ASP. Dr. Hayes office approved the use of ASP in soft drinks just two months before he quit his job as FDA chief. He then obtained a job with a public relations firm who represents NutraSweet.\n1984 - Seven million pounds of NutraSweet are swallowed by about 100,000 people.\n1985 - Reports of side-effects mount.\n1987 - ACSN is founded by Mary Nash Stoddard and consumer advocate, James Turner. They believe ASP should be recalled and retested as a drug.\nIncreasing Brain Tumor Rates: Is There a Link to Aspartame\nDr. Erik Millstone, MD\nScience Policy Research Unit Mantell Building\nUniversity of Sussex Brighton\nBN1 9RF England October 1996\nThe artificial sweetener aspartame is said by some commentators to be the most fully tested and safest food additive in industrial history. Because it is a dipeptide of two familiar and essential amino acids, namely Aspartic acid and phenylalanine, there are prima facie reasons for thinking that it should be safe. It is, moreover, one of the most successful synthetic chemicals every produced.\nThe dominant producer is the Nutrasweet Corporation (a subsidiary of Monsanto), and a recently published estimate suggested that world sales amounted to approximately $1,000 million in 1995.(1) Doubts about the safety of this compound have, however, surfaced repeatedly during its turbulent history, and a particularly serious set of fresh doubts have recently emerged in a paper in the journal Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology, focusing on the possibility that aspartame might be contributing to the increasing incidence of brain cancer.(2)\nProf. John Olney of Washington University St. Louis and his colleagues have based their hypothesis on several sets of considerations. Firstly, they analyzed the cancer statistics gathered by the US National Cancer Institute from catchment areas representing approximately 10% of the US population for the period since 1975. They found that the introduction of aspartame into the USA, into dry goods in 1981 and soft drinks in 1983, was followed by an abrupt increase (of approximately 10%) in the reported incidence of brain tumors. The change was most noticeable between 1984 and 1985, and it corresponded to approximately 1,500 extra cases of brain cancer per year in the USA.\nTheir second main finding is that there has also been a marked change in the incidence of particular types of brain tumors, with a reduction in the proportion of a relatively unaggressive (and often preliminary) type of tumor (astrocytomas) and a sharp increase in the incidence of a far more aggressive (and all too often terminal) type of tumor (glioblastomas). The investigators argue, moreover, that the reported changes in tumor incidence were unlikely to have been artifacts of improvements in diagnostic technologies.\nThe introduction and rapid diffusion of computerized tomography in the early to mid- 1970s, and of magnetic resonance imaging technology in the early to mid-1980s, certainly improved diagnostic precision. But they contend that the impact of those innovations upon the reported incidence of these central nervous system (CNS) tumors had fully worked their way through before aspartame was introduced.\nBefore these imaging technologies were introduced, it was far harder to diagnose brain cancer. Consequently, it was often not until tumors developed into glioblastomas that they were diagnosed, and a relatively high portion of tumors at the earlier astrocytoma stage went undetected. When the imaging technologies were introduced, brain tumors tended to be detected at the earlier stage, and consequently in the late 1970s the number of reported astrocytomas went up, while the number of glioblastomas exhibited a corresponding decline.\nAfter aspartame was introduced, however, the opposite pattern can be found. The incidence of glioblastomas rose sharply, and starting in the late 1980s the number of astrocytomas declined even more sharply. Since those latter changes run counter to the direction which could be attributed to the introduction of better diagnostic technologies, it is hard to see how the reported changing tumor incidence could be ascribed to innovations in diagnosis. If the apparent increase in overall incidence had been due to improved diagnostics, then we should expect a marked change in post- diagnostic survival rates, but no such change was evident.\nOlney and his colleagues suspect aspartame to be implicated in the etiology of the extra cases of brain cancer for three main reasons. Firstly, the type of CNS tumor found to be increasing most rapidly in the USA is the same kind of lesion as was found in one of the animal studies conducted on aspartame in the 1970s.(3) Indeed, when the safety of aspartame was considered by a Public Board of Inquiry in 1980, it recommended against the approval of aspartame primarily because of a concern that aspartame appeared to be a brain carcinogen in rodents. A team of scientists at the US Food and Drug Administration concurred with the judgment of the Board, and they too recommended that further studies be conducted to clarify the issue before aspartame could be considered acceptably safe for use. Both the Public Board of Inquiry and the FDA staff scientists were, however, over-ruled by the incoming FDA Commissioner, Arthur Hull Hayes, who asserted that the brain cancer risk was minimal and that further research was not necessary.\nOlney and his colleagues have also drawn attention to the results of a study by Shephard et al published in 1993.(4) Shephard and her colleagues attempted to simulate in vitro the conditions that can occur in the human digestive tract, and in particular the conditions which result in the nitrosation of dietary ingredients. They reported that the nitrosated aspartame had significant mutagenic action. That evidence may be important because it suggests not only a mechanism through which aspartame could exert a possible carcinogenic action, but also why the interval between the compound\u2019s introduction and the elevation of brain cancer rates appears to have been so brief.\nOlney et al also suggest that aspartame may reasonably be suspected of responsibility because the other main candidates for responsibility, such as ionizing radiation, smoke inhalation, pesticides, electromagnetic fields and various other chemicals were gradually introduced over recent decades rather than all at once in the early 1980s. Exposures to those potential hazards are, furthermore, occupational linked and it is hard to see how they could explain why males and females seem to be equally affected.\nIf Olney\u2019s hypothesis is to be substantiated it will be necessary to analyze several long-term brain cancer time- series data sets for other countries covering the period both before and since aspartame was introduced. That has proved difficult because while aggregate brain cancer statistics are readily available, information on tumors types is hard to obtain. If aspartame were to act by modifying an already present or nascent brain cancer, we should expect its impact to vary in different countries in ways which depend on the age structure of the consumers of this sweetener. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a larger proportion of 50 to 70 year old Americans consume aspartame-sweetened products than is the case in the UK or in other European countries. An alternative approach might therefore entail conducting new long-term animal feeding studies, but their relevance to humans is endlessly contestable.\nWhile Olney and his colleagues have raised complex questions about the safety of aspartame, other questions have previously been raised without having been fully answered. The manner in which no fewer than 15 of the initial safety tests were conducted and reported during the 1970s has been repeatedly criticized. An FDA task force showed, for example, that in one particular study it was impossible to identify the occasion on which a particular animals had died. As the report says: \u201cObservation records indicated that animal A23LM was alive at week 88, dead from week 92 through week 104, alive at week 108, and dead at week 112.\u201d(5)\nThat represented just one of 52 significant shortcomings in the conduct and reporting of just one of those 15 studies. Those studies have, moreover, never been repeated. Several commentators have therefore argued that unless and until those 15 pivotal studies are repeated, no-one can be in a position confidently to assert that aspartame is safe. In the mid-to-late 1980s, a series of reports started to emerge suggesting that aspartame is capable of acute adverse reactions in a small proportion of sensitive consumers. The symptoms reported include headaches and blurred vision at the most mild through to epileptic-type seizures at the most severe. The accumulation of evidence, concerning both acute and chronic hazards, now poses a substantial problem for both regulatory officials and for the general public.\nThe challenge for policy-makers, as ever, is to decide how much evidence is sufficient to support a judgment that something is either sufficiently safe or that it poses a significant hazard. A decision of that sort, in relation to an artificial sweetener, will depend on a judgment about the balance of benefits and risks. It is, however, quite hard to demonstrate that artificial sweeteners are beneficial to any group other than diabetics. The period since the early 1980s has seen a rapid rise in the consumption of artificial sweeteners, but there has been no corresponding decline in the consumption of sugar, either in the USA, the UK or in the European Union as a whole. That implies that, in aggregate, artificial sweeteners are not acting as sugar substitutes but merely as supplements to sugar consumption.\nMany of the products containing artificial sweeteners are labeled as \u2018diet\u2019 products implying that consuming artificially sweetened products helps people to control or even to reduce their weight. There is however no reliable evidence to indicate that artificial sweeteners actually help people loose weight. On the contrary, the bulk of the available evidence suggests that in relation to attempted weight loss, artificial sweeteners are at best ineffective and at worst counter-productive.\nThere is, in particular, evidence that artificial sweeteners are appetite stimulants, and while a particular mouthful of artificially sweetened food or drink may contain fewer calories than their sugar-sweetened analogues, the consumption of artificial sweeteners may provoke people into going on, what might be termed, \u2018a calorie hunt\u2019. If the likely benefits and risks of aspartame are to be properly explored, and if consumers are to be properly informed and protected, these complex issues need to be explored in a comprehensive and open fashion, and not behind closed doors, be they in Whitehall, in the European Commission in Brussels or at the World Health Organization\u2019s office in Geneva. The public are entitled to be sure, in particular, that none of the experts advising the authorities are acting as paid consultants to the companies which either manufacture or utilize artificial sweeteners. Neither the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food nor the Department of Health, nor the European Commission nor even the WHO can provide such an assurance.\nFootnotes\n1.

So does China, in addition Korea, and Paraguay, Brazil, and many other countries. In fact so did the USA until that fateful day when aspartame was approved as a no calorie sweetener by the FDA. Suddenly a trade complaint was launched, and the FDA out of the blue decided that Stevia and Stevioside were now unsafe. They even issued an import alert. The FDA reversed themselves and we can now provide you with this safe, tasty product if we sell it as a dietary supplement. The important thing is that JAJA Stevioside is now available to you once again.

This can not stand!\nWe had several people call and ask why JAJA Stevioside is $93.20 for \u00bd Kilo (1.1 lbs) while some other stevioside is selling for between $14.99 and $21.99 a pound. That is a very good question. Very good indeed.\nHere's why...\nIf you compare the serving size and quantity you will find that JAJA Stevioside serving size is the size of a sesame seed. That is because JAJA Stevioside is 100% pure. It does not \u201dStart with pure stevioside\u201c and then add Erythitol, or silica, or FOS, or whatever filler happens to be the cheapest available like the other cheaper brands do.\nOne in particular that uses Erythitol has a serving size of 1/3 or 3/4 of a tea spoon. Their 1 pound container has 453 servings. Where JAJA Stevioside (pure stevioside) has over 38,000 servings. Remember a serving of table sugar is One Table Spoon. A serving of JAJA Stevioside is about the size of ONE Sesame seed.\nSo comparing prices...\n$93.20/38000 = $0.00245 per serving compared to (and let's go low)\n$14.00/453 = .031 per serving\nThat means that JAJA Stevioside costs far Less than a penny a serving, while the other brands - even at $14.00 a pound cost 3 pennies per serving! So which saves you money?\nPurity versus a product made with really cheap fillers. You are intelligent. You decide.\nLets Make This Clearer\nTake the dollar amount per serving (0.031) and multiply that by the amount of servings you get in 1/2 kg of JAJA Stevioside 38,000 and do you know what you get?... If you said ripped off by them, you are correct.\nDon't Get Ripped Off\nLook at the numbers!\n$0.031 X 38000 = $1,178\nAnd that ($1,178) is what you would pay to get an amount equal to the number of servings in \u00bdKg JAJA Stevioside which costs only $93.20... Gives You A Savings of $1084.80... Quite a difference, don't you agree?\nWe don't play games because we don't have to. Our product and quality are good enough to speak for themselves.\nA word on Rebaudiosides\nThe stevioside molecule consists of stevioside, rebaudioside, and glycoside and a portion of other materials (water for instance). So when you see a company bragging on a super high percentage of rebaudioside, don't be fooled by their games. They are only trying to confuse you. They can do it because you are looking for high quality, and you have questions. You would expect a company selling a product to know about it. NOT go about misinforming and cheating customers and potential customers.\nIf someone claims to have 40% rebaudioside it really does not mean much. It means that the percentage of the stevioside molecule allegedly has 40% rebaudioside. So if you are getting a stevioside claiming to be 96% with 40% rebaudioside you would be getting 40% of 96%. However it is highly unlikely that they can (1.) consistently produce to that level, and (2.) actually measure rebaudioside content.\nWe have been selling JAJA Stevioside for over 10 years. Our facility in China exports world wide, including Japan (the country with the strictest regulations on import quality and safety). Many of the trading companies in China go to our facility and buy some samples, then sell them to customers (a lot of the companies here in the USA). When it comes time to order, these trading companies go to a low quality cheap producer instead of our facility in China and switch to low quality product.\nJAJA Stevioside does not change taste or quality from batch to batch.

Sugar is enjoyable in many different types of foods, and to satisfy a craving for sweets without the sugar there are even artificial and low-sugar sweetening options.\nAlthough when you hear the word sugar you might automatically think of the white crystals you buy in a large paper bag, there are actually many different types of sugar. Some kinds of sugar are better than others for specific uses and recipes, and they all have their own unique tastes, textures and other characteristics.\nHere are some of the different kinds of sugar you may see in recipes or in desserts you eat. It is especially helpful to know about these varieties in case you run across them in a recipe:\nGranulated Sugar. This is the most common type of sugar. It has many uses, and is made up of small white granules. It is popular in many recipes and can also be found sold as cubes.\nPowdered Sugar. This sugar, which has been ground down into a very fine powder and mixed with a small amount of corn starch, is often used for frosting and icing recipes.\nRaw Sugar. Raw sugar is less processed than other kinds of sugar. It still contains molasses because it has not reached the point where it would have been removed to create other sugars, like granulated sugar.\nBrown Sugar. Although it has several varieties, in general brown sugar is a dark tan color and is moister than other types of sugar. This sugar gets its brown color from molasses, and can be either light or dark depending on the amount used in the sugar. Brown sugar can dry out and become hard, so special measures might need to be taken to prevent or reduce dryness.\nCoarse Sugar. This variety of sugar is known for its larger granule size and round shape. It is often used for decorating.\nSuperfine Sugar. Superfine sugar has extra-small crystals, but is in every other way like granulated sugar. This type of sugar is quick to dissolve.\nArtificial/Reduced Sugar Sweeteners. Many kinds of sugar substitutes and \"low sugar\" sugars exist and can be used in various ways. Aspartame, sucralose, saccharin sugar alcohol and Stevia are a few examples of these sweeteners. For many, these substitutes are great alternatives to sugar, but be sure to do research on these products before using: they can have varying effects on different people.\nWhen you are aware of the different forms that sugar can be found in, you will be ready when you find them listed in a recipe.\n"}, {"score": 942.47766, "uuid": "48de11d8-ef9b-522e-b50f-c455d18695b2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400tw-22-15142", "target_hostname": "www.chicagotribune.com", "target_uri": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/sc-health-0404-free-from-foods-20120404,0,4613873.story", "page_rank": 1.2112723e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "<em>Sugar</em>-free, fat-free, gluten free: <em>Are</em> these healthy options?", "snippet": "Watch out for: Most foods that contain <em>artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em> <em>are</em> highly processed and offer very little in terms of nutrition, said Bellatti.", "explanation": null, "document": "By Julie Deardorff , Tribune Newspapers\n7:28 p.m. CDT, April 4, 2012\n\"Free-from\" food products, whether they're labeled sugar-free, fat-free or gluten-free, are fast becoming a trendy lifestyle choice, regardless of allergies or intolerance.\nThe popularity of these products, tastier and more widely available than ever, is driven by health-focused consumers, research firms say. These so-called avoiders are also swayed by the \"health halo,\" or the perception that the product is better for you because it's lacking an ingredient or nutrient, said Andy Bellatti, a Seattle-based nutritionist and the author of the Small Bites blog.\nAlmost 3,000 new products with \"suitable-for\" or free-from claims were launched in 2010 across the U.S. and Western Europe according Leatherhead, a market research firm.\nProducts labeled gluten-free and dairy-free have shown the most growth. But free-from processed foods aren't necessarily better choices. A fat-free cookie, for example, is mostly refined grains and sugar and offers no nutrition, Bellatti said. On the other hand, an avocado is full of fat and is much healthier than a fat-free energy bar.\nMeanwhile, \"a sugar-free product can nevertheless contain troubling ingredients, such as genetically modified corn byproducts, artificial dyes and artificial sweeteners,\" said Bellatti. \"The path toward health is paved with real, whole foods, not artificially produced goods free of a particular nutrient,\" he said.\nHere's how to make smart choices when shopping the free-from offerings:\nGluten-free\nWhat it means: Unlike fat- and sugar-free, gluten-free is essential for those who are gluten intolerant or have celiac disease , a digestive condition triggered by eating the protein gluten. Foods without certain grains, including wheat, rye, barley, spelt, kamut, triticale and crossbred hybrids, can be considered gluten-free, according to a proposed definition by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .\nCommon substitutions: Products often use a combination of gluten-free flours, such as chickpea flour, brown rice flour, oat flour, buckwheat flour. Many gluten-free products use different gums, such as xanthan, carob bean and guar gum, said Bellatti.\nWatch out for: Starches. \"The potato starch, cornstarch, tapioca starch and rice starch typically used in nearly all gluten-free foods are among the few foods that raise blood sugar higher than even whole wheat,\" said William Davis, a preventive cardiologist in Milwaukee. \"This triggers insulin resistance and abdominal weight gain and can lead to heart disease , cataracts, arthritis and hypertension . Eating gluten-free (processed) foods is little better than eating jelly beans,\" said Davis, the author of \"Wheat Belly.\" Also, look beyond gluten substitutes, advised Bellatti. A gluten-free frozen dinner can contain trans fats or be low in fiber or minerals, he said.\nOn the label: Look for ingredients like \"ground almonds and other ground nuts, coconut flour, ground flaxseed and occasionally other flours that do not cause blood sugar to skyrocket nor trigger any of the other phenomena,\" said Davis. Bellatti suggests whole grains such as brown rice, gluten-free oats and pseudograins such as quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat and millet. Or, even better, chose whole and minimally processed naturally gluten-free foods, such as fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, nuts and seeds.\nSugar-free\nWhat it means: The product contains less than 0.5 gram of sugars per serving, according to the FDA. But sugar-free can still be full of calories and carbohydrates, said registered dietitian Hope Warshaw, a diabetes educator. In fact, if a sugar-free food is not low or reduced in calories, the company must disclose that fact.\nCommon substitutions: Companies can make a sugar-free claim by using artificial sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame- potassium , and sucralose \u2014 also known as Splenda) or sugar alcohols (sorbitol, maltitol). On average, sugar alcohols, found in ice creams, cookies, puddings, candies and chewing gum, provide about half the calories of sugar and other carbohydrates.\nWatch out for: Most foods that contain artificial sweeteners are highly processed and offer very little in terms of nutrition, said Bellatti. People who regularly eat/drink artificial sweeteners, he said, may not find fruit to \"hit the sweet spot\" because their taste buds have been trained to appreciate aspartame's sweetness as the standard. \"The compounds register as hundreds of times sweeter than sugar and train our taste buds to crave flavors unrivaled by nature,\" said Bellatti. \"Keep in mind, too, that some low-carb snack products contain sugar alcohols (like maltitol and sorbitol) that can cause gastrointestinal distress,\" Bellatti added.\nOn the label: Sugar-free foods often include genetically modified ingredients, refined grains, unhealthy and processed fats, food dyes and chemical preservatives.\nFat-free\nWhat it means: The product contains no more than 0.5 grams of fat per serving, but serving is defined by the manufacturer.\nCommon substitutions: Fat is usually replaced with a polysaccharide starch product like maltodextrin, modified cornstarch or tapioca starch, which break down into sugars, said William Lassek, co-author of \"Why Women Need Fat.\" The starch is often chemically modified to make it easier to digest. To give the products the feeling of fat in the mouth, companies might use other kinds of polysaccharides like pectin (from citrus fruits), carrageenan (from seaweed) and guar gum (from the guar bean), said Lassek.\nWatch out for: Fat-free products usually have fewer calories than regular ones, but as much or more carbohydrates, said Lassek, an assistant professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the Graduate School of Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh . There's little if any evidence showing that switching to fat-free foods results in lower weights or better health. \"People who eat fat-free foods are likely to make up for the calories they save by eating more of those or other foods, since our bodies are very good at keeping our intake of calories constant,\" said Lassek. And fat-free candy? It's pure sugar.\nOn the label: Look for healthful fats, such as omega-3 fatty acids or the monounsaturated fats in olives, walnuts, pecans, almonds and avocados. Many nutrients, including vitamins A, D, E and K, are fat soluble, which means they need to be eaten with fat to be absorbed. Additionally, dietary fat helps provide a feeling of fullness, said Bellatti. \"That's why 150 calories of almonds (which provide protein, fiber and fat) are more filling than 150 calories of pretzels (which offer very little, if any, of those three),\" he said.\nDairy- or lactose-free\nWhat it means: The FDA hasn't defined dairy- or lactose-free. In general, dairy-free should not contain cow's milk, while lactose-free products have had the lactose, or milk sugar, removed.\nCommon substitutions: Almond-, hemp- and coconut-based products are fueling the growth in this sector, according to the market research firm Mintel. Soy milk, goat and rice milk are also commonly used.\nWatch out for: People with milk allergies are allergic to the milk protein, which is still present when lactose is removed. Also beware of added sugars. Even plain varieties can contain 6 grams \u2014 a teaspoon and a half of added sugar, said Bellatti, who recommends unsweetened varieties.\nOn the label: If the label contains milk, cream, butter, evaporated or powdered milk, milk solids, margarine, cheese whey or curds, the product probably contains lactose.\n31%: Percentage increase in sales of \"free-from\" products in natural markets from 2008 to 2010. Sales were $210.6 million in 2008 and $276.4 million in 2010, according to the market research firm Mintel.\n"}, {"score": 933.3746, "uuid": "f7e96373-cf2e-5e19-8a29-7a4e72cbcc9a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0205wb-79-30103", "target_hostname": "www.newsrx.com", "target_uri": "http://www.newsrx.com/press-releases/13106.html", "page_rank": 1.2556038e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "NewsRx - Increase in <em>Sugar</em> Consumption Raises Concerns", "snippet": "Isaac Eliaz, &quot;forms of <em>sugar</em> that <em>are</em> not processed <em>are</em> <em>better</em> choices <em>than</em> highly processed and refined <em>sugars</em>, for several reasons. Highly refined <em>sugars</em> tend to produce a much higher spike in blood glucose levels <em>than</em> unprocessed or unrefined <em>sugars</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Printer-Friendly Version\nWhen American individuals consumed only five pounds of sugar per year, prior to the 1900s, incidences of cancer, diabetes and heart disease were rare. Today, it is estimated that the average American consumes more than 135 pounds of sugar per year. Wellness Expert Dr. Isaac Eliaz is uncovering some astounding new research in order to clarify what is the most healthful sweetener to use in moderation, and which ones to avoid.\nWith the many forms of sugar available, from table sugar, to high-fructose corn syrup to agave and honey, understanding the differences between sugars and their effects on the body is not all sweet. Any form of sugar, in excess, weakens the immune system, causes inflammation in the body, and increases the risk for serious health conditions such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.\nAccording to Dr. Isaac Eliaz, \"forms of sugar that are not processed are better choices than highly processed and refined sugars, for several reasons. Highly refined sugars tend to produce a much higher spike in blood glucose levels than unprocessed or unrefined sugars. They also lack the trace nutrients that can still be found in unrefined, more natural sugars.\" Highly refined sugars are very difficult for the body to process, and therefore deplete your nutrient reserves as your body struggles to re-balance itself after ingesting these chemicals.\nFor natural sweeteners, turn to alternative such as raw honey, real maple syrup (grade B contains more trace minerals) and unprocessed stevia. Again, even these sweeteners should be minimized and if you are diabetic or fighting cancer, it is best to avoid all sweeteners. After ridding your body of these addictive substances, the cravings will subside and you can better appreciate foods that are naturally sweet on their own.\nRaw, unprocessed honey contains a variety of antioxidants, enzymes and trace amounts of vitamins like thiamin and niacin. Dr. Eliaz says, \"it also has antioxidant and antibacterial properties, both internally and externally.\" Raw honey can help to heal wounds because it contains an antiseptic substance called inhibine, which acts to promote healing and prevent infection. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that help soothe a sore throat or congested bronchial and nasal passages during a cold. Studies have also shown it to have anti-tumor potential, and some research suggests that consuming local, raw honey prior to the spring can help blunt seasonal allergies. Raw honey contains an enzyme that makes it much easier to digest than regular sugar, therefore lowering its effects on blood glucose levels.\nDr. Eliaz found that maple syrup and maple sugar are other alternatives to processed sugar. But it is vital to make sure it is authentic maple syrup from trees, not flavored and filled with high-fructose corn syrup. Although more expensive, maple syrup and sugar are good sources of zinc and manganese, as well as trace amounts of calcium, iron and magnesium.\nThe stevia plant is native to South America and is extremely sweet in comparison to table sugar. Steviosides and rebaudiosides are the natural compounds in stevia that create its sweet taste, but contain much fewer calories than sugar. It is important to buy the actual dried herb or ground, green stevia, and not the white stevia, as this is a telltale sign of bleaching and processing.\nArtificial sweeteners, such as sucralose, cyclamate, aspartame, and saccharin are highly controversial, and many, especially aspartame, have been directly linked to neurological disorders and other serious problems. These chemicals have can wreak serious havoc on the body and should be avoided completely.\nThe question of why we consume so much sugar requires a complex answer that involves a multitude of physiological, psychological and environmental factors. However, as we educate ourselves as to the effects of such over-consumption, and make healthier choices, we can help others to do the same, thus spreading awareness and strengthening ourselves and communities with empowerment and knowledge.

Have Your Cake and Eat It Too\n\"Is sugar an IBS trigger? Should I use artificial sweeteners instead?\"\nWhile people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome do have to adjust their diets to control IBS symptoms, this does NOT mean a life of dessert deprivation. (Whew!)\nIn fact, replacing sugar with artificial sweeteners will likely make digestive problems worse, not better.\nPlain baking and cooking sugars, such as granulated, powdered, and brown sugar, are simply sucrose, and sucrose is not an IBS trigger. Refined sugar may not be a health food, but it isn't a GI stimulant or irritant. This means that digestion-friendly desserts need not be sugar-free, they must simply avoid or replace known IBS triggers like dairy, high fat levels, and excessive insoluble fiber.\nIBS sufferers should be aware, however, that another type of sugar, fructose - fruit sugar - can cause diarrhea, gas, bloating, and cramps. Fructose is a naturally occurring simple sugar, and is found in concentrated amounts in many commercial drinks, high-fructose corn syrup, and fruit juice concentrates. Adding to the confusion, many people are misdiagnosed with IBS when they actually have fructose intolerance, which a simple breath test can diagnose.\nFructose accounts for less than 10% of the weight of much fresh fruit such as strawberries, bananas or apples. So, please don't eliminate all fresh fruits from your diet, as you need their nutritional benefits. However, dried fruit and fruit juices are far more concentrated sources of fructose, and you might have to restrict them, at least to some degree.\nIf you find yourself faced with eating more fructose than you're confident will be safe, make sure to take your Tummy Fiber first. This will at least give you an added measure of safety and help keep your gut calm.\nIn addition, remember that there is no such thing as an artificial sweetener that is proven safe for IBS. Aspartame, sucralose, saccharine, sorbitol, and other sugar alcohols (xylitol, maltitol) are popular artificial sweeteners, but they can all cause digestive side effects ranging from gas and bloating to severe abdominal cramps and urgent diarrhea. In some cases, they can provoke these symptoms in people who don't even have IBS, so imagine what they do to those with hypersensitive bowels.\nPeople with IBS can absolutely have their cake and eat it too. In fact, there are hundreds of delicious, IBS-safe dessert possibilities !\nYou can even make desserts that actively help IBS symptoms. The key to an IBS-friendly recipe is a high soluble fiber foundation, from ingredients and/or the addition of a prebiotic soluble fiber supplement such as Heather's Tummy Fiber , and the substitution of triggers with safe replacements.\nInclude herbs that are digestive aids, such as peppermint , ginger, or fennel for even better results.\nFor delicious proof, try the Glorious Mango Cheesecake recipe in this newsletter.\nThe sweet conclusion? There's no need for people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome to avoid sugar or eliminate desserts from their diet.

These foods cause a surge in insulin and women with the highest insulin levels have a 283% higher incidence of breast cancer.\nDangerous Foe in a Sweet Disguise\nEstimates are that every year the average American eats almost his or her entire body weight in sugar. The average teenage boy eats thirty-four teaspoons of sugar a day, and the average teenage girl consumes twenty-four. You can easily see how this is possible when you add it up. Sugar is added to virtually all processed foods, especially soda pop. The average can of cola, such as Coke or Pepsi, contains ten to twelve teaspoons of sugar! There\u0092s a new breakfast cereal with a whopping eighteen teaspoons of sugar per serving; that\u0092s one-third of a cup, or the equivalent of forty-eight Hershey\u0092s Kisses. You\u0092re probably aware that sugar\u0092s bad for your teeth, but you can brush them. So, what\u0092s the big deal, you might ask? The big deal is that research shows that sugar and refined carbohydrates are detrimental to your health in a multitude of ways, including increasing the risk of many chronic disorders including diabetes, obesity, heart disease and breast cancer.\nINSULIN\nCancer cells love sugar. It\u0092s their preferred fuel. The more sugar you eat, the faster cancer cells grow. Your pancreas responds to sugar by releasing insulin, the hormone that escorts sugar into your cells. When you eat refined simple sugars, such as white table sugar, candy, cookies, or other sugar-laden foods, your blood sugar levels rise very quickly. Your pancreas responds by releasing a lot of insulin. That\u0092s not good. High insulin levels are one of the biggest risk factors and promoters of breast cancer. Women with high insulin levels have a 283 percent greater risk of breast cancer.\nWhen it comes to breast cancer, insulin is no friend. One of the biggest reason is due to the fact that both normal breast cells and cancer cells have insulin receptors on them. When insulin attaches to its receptor, it has the same effect as when estrogen attaches to its receptor; it causes cells to start dividing. The higher your insulin levels are, the faster your breast cells will divide; the faster they divide, the higher your risk of breast cancer is and the faster any existing cancer cells will grow.\nThere's another wound that insulin can inflict, too. It attacks a portion of the estrogen cycle, making more estrogen available to attach to the estrogen receptors in breast tissue. Insulin regulates how much of the estrogen in your blood is available to attach to estrogen receptors in your breast tissue. When estrogen travels in the blood, it either travels alone seeking a mate (an estrogen receptor), or it travels with a partner (a protein binder) that prevents it from attaching to an estrogen receptor. Insulin regulates the number of protein binders in the blood. So, the higher your insulin levels are, the fewer the number of protein binders there will be and therefore the more free estrogen that will be available to attach to estrogen receptors.\nIn other words, when your insulin levels are up, free-estrogen levels are up, too. And both of them speed up cell division. That\u0092s why high insulin levels increase your risk of breast cancer so much.\nDANGER\u0097SUGAR!\nEating sugar increases your risk of breast cancer in another way. It delivers a major blow to your immune system with the force of a prize fighter. Your immune system is your natural defense against such invaders as bacteria, viruses, and cancer cells. Research shows that right after you eat a high-sugar meal, the function of the cells in your immune system drops drastically. In the case of one type of cell in particular, the T lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell), sugar knocks its defense abilities down by at least 50 percent. This effect lasts for a minimum of five hours! Another researcher found that the function of T lymphocytes dropped by 94 percent after a high-sugar meal! This means that right after you\u0092ve eaten a lot of sugar, your body's ability to fight off invaders or destroy cancer cells is tremendously weakened for several hours.\nOver a period of time, eating too much sugar can create imbalances that lead to two more deadly diseases: obesity and diabetes. Both of these diseases dangerously increase your risk of breast cancer, and both have increased alarmingly in the United States in the past two decades. An estimated 60 percent of the adult population is overweight, and 5 percent have diabetes. Of those people who have diabetes, 90 percent are also overweight. Not only do these diseases increase your risk of breast cancer, but they also increase your risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, poor circulation, stroke, and infection.\nA study conducted by Harvard Medical School and published in 2004 found that women who ate foods with a high glycemic index (foods that cause blood sugars to soar, such as refined carbohydrates and sugars) as teenagers had a higher incidence of breast cancer later in life. So, encouraging your teenage daughter to cut back on sugar will help her to lower her risk of breast cancer for the rest of her life.\nSWEET RELIEF\nNow, the good news: If you have a sweet tooth, you\u0092ll be relieved to know that you don't have to suffer. There\u0092s a natural sweetener that tastes great, and better yet, research has shown that instead of being dangerous to your health, it actually has several wonderful health-supporting qualities. It's called Stevia, and it comes from the South American plant Stevia rebaudiana. What's interesting about this semi shrub, indigenous to Paraguay, is that every part of it tastes intensely sweet. The dried leaves, however, are the only parts that are used for medicinal and commercial purposes. Scientists have found that Stevia\u0092s delightfully sweet flavor comes from a group of substances in it called \"glycosidal diterpenes.\"\nCompared to sugar, only very small amounts of Stevia are needed. That\u0092s because Stevia is 300 times sweeter than sucrose, the type of sugar found in table sugar. Stevia hasn't yet been approved by the FDA as a food additive \u0097 write your senators and Congressional representatives! \u0097 so at this time you won't find it in any processed foods in the United States. In this country Stevia is considered a dietary supplement. Health food stores and national-chain grocery stores that specialize in organic foods, such as Wild Oats and Whole Foods, usually carry Stevia.\nStevia comes in multiple forms: a fine white powder, a green powder, or a liquid. I found that certain brands of Stevia can taste bitter or leave a weird aftertaste if you use too much. There\u0092s one brand, however, that solved this problem by adding some fiber to it. It is called SteviaPlus by SweetLeaf.\nStevia can also be used in cooking, but it\u0092s a little tricky. The amount you should use can vary a lot from brand to brand, so you definitely should use a Stevia cookbook. Many of the companies with Stevia products have their own cookbooks.\nStevia has been used for hundreds if not thousands of years by the native tribes in Paraguay and Brazil to treat high blood pressure and diabetes. Modern research has shown that it does help both conditions. Stevia causes blood vessels to dilate. When the diameter of a blood vessel increases, the blood pressure in it goes down. A double-blind placebo-controlled study was published in the British Journal of Pharmacology in the year 2000 documenting Stevia\u0092s ability to lower blood pressure. Researchers found that after only three months, patients with high blood pressure who were given Stevia three times a day had a significant decrease in both their systolic (the upper number) and diastolic (the lower number) blood-pressure numbers.\nStevia is a great sugar substitute for people who really need to avoid sugar, such as diabetics. In addition, Stevia has an added benefit for type 2 diabetics: It seems to have an effect opposite to that of sugar on their bodies; it causes blood sugar to go down. Research has also discovered two more Stevia health benefits. First, it can kill certain bacteria and viruses. In a study published in 2001, Stevia was found to have antiviral effects against the rotavirus. This virus can cause severe diarrhea and dehydration, especially in infants. Secondly, Stevia shows a strong ability to kill a wide range of food-born bacteria.\nAnother, healthy natural substitute for sugar is also available. It's made from Luo Han Guo, the round green fruit of the Chinese plant Siraita grosvenori. Luo Han Guo has been used in China as a medicine since the thirteenth century, but it didn\u0092t become popular as a remedy for coughs, sore throats, and upper respiratory-tract infections until the twentieth century. In southern China Luo Han Guo is also used to enhance longevity. Like Stevia, Luo Han Guo is about 300 times sweeter than sugar and is processed into a fine, white crystalline powder. Wisdom Natural Brands makes a sugar substitute using a blend of Luo Han Guo and fructose called Sweet and Slender. It can be purchased at most health food stores or on the Internet.\n"}, {"score": 926.93677, "uuid": "d3198bd8-ef89-5c09-bc63-69698d33dbae", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1310wb-37-30301", "target_hostname": "www.cargill.com", "target_uri": "http://www.cargill.com/news/releases/2011/NA3051754.jsp", "page_rank": 1.1717515e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Cargill: News - The #1 Natural Calorie-free <em>Sweetener</em> in the US, Truvia", "snippet": "Azucarera Ebro is the leading <em>sugar</em> producer in Spain with a market share of <em>white</em> <em>sugar</em> and brown cane <em>sugar</em> in the region of 800,000 tons.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\n.\nThe #1 Natural Calorie-free Sweetener in the US, Truvia\u00ae Partners with Leading Sugar Companies in Europe on Eve of European Approval\nTruvia\u00ae Business Announces Four European Partnerships to Deliver Stevia-Based sweetener to consumers\nMinneapolis, MN \u2013 10 November 2011 \u2013 The Truvia\u00ae business announced today another important step in the Pan-European rollout of the leading stevia-based sweetener.

Although it's considered harmless in comparison, sugar, in excess, can cause a host of problems for a lot of us: cravings, binge eating, weight gain and heart disease among them. According to the USDA, the average American consumed 151 pounds of sugar in 1999\u2014an all time high. Since then, consumption has dropped slightly and in 2010 the average American consumed 132 pounds. (To put that into perspective, consider that the number was just 4 pounds in the year 1700.) At least half of the sugar we consume comes from soft drinks, fruit drinks, and sports drinks. The rest sneaks into our diets in the form of ketchup, teriyaki sauce, chocolate milk and the obvious sweets like cookies, cakes, ice cream and even breakfast cereal . Surprisingly, some \"healthy foods\" such as yogurt and instant oatmeal can pack in 20-30 grams (5-7 teaspoons) of unnecessary added sugar! It seems like we're drowning in sugar, and nobody is wearing a life vest.\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that we limit our daily sugar consumption to 7% or less of our daily calorie intake\u2014that's about 6 teaspoons (100 calories) for women and 9 teaspoons (150 calories) for men. But that adds up fast. Just one 12-ounce can of regular soda contains 8-10 teaspoons of sugar and 130-150 calories. One glazed donut contains 6 teaspoons, and a half cup ice cream (the standard serving size, although most portions are much, much larger) contains 4 grams of added sugar!\nWhy Should You Care? Is Sugar Actually Bad for You?\nWell, aside from the increased bulge around the waistline, diets high in sugar are strongly linked to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes , elevated triglycerides , low HDL (good) cholesterol levels, and heart disease . Sugar intake has also been linked to depression, migraines, poor eyesight, autoimmune diseases (such as arthritis, and multiple sclerosis), gout and osteoporosis.\nRecent research has shown that a high intake of carbohydrates, including sugar, releases a feel good chemical in the brain called serotonin. Think of how you feel after indulging in a high sugar meal or treat\u2014almost euphoric, right? The high of a sugar rush is temporary though. After a few hours\u2014or even a few minutes\u2014you start to crash and you become tired, fatigued and lethargic.\nAlthough sweet foods are tempting and delicious to most people (blame Mother Nature for that!), the more sugar you eat, the higher your tolerance becomes. So if you have a strong sweet tooth or intense cravings for sugar, chances are not that you were born that way, but that your dietary habits and food choices created the sugar monster you may have become.\nFortunately, we can reverse this tolerance in just a couple of weeks by cutting out sugar. Once you have decreased your threshold, something that tasted perfectly sweet a few weeks ago, will begin to taste too sweet to eat, and that can help you reduce your intake of the sweet stuff.\nCutting Out Sugar: A 4-Week Action Plan\nWhile the occasional sweet treat won't make or break your weight loss or your health, many people have trouble stopping after a sensible portion or saying no to sugar when it's available. If you feel out of control around sugar, then a sugar \"detox\" is a great way to reduce your cravings, eat better, and bring sugar back to where it belongs: as an occasional treat that you consciously choose to eat in a mindful manner, not a daily treat occurrence that controls you.\nFollow this month-long plan to break your sugar addiction!\nWeek 1: Identify Sugar and Where It's Hiding\nThe first step in conquering your sugar habit is to rid your pantry and refrigerator of added sugar. Some things (think ice cream, cookies and candy) are obvious, but most of us need to look closer at where the sugar in our diets is coming from. This will require a bit of label reading in the beginning, but after a while, it will become easier.\nIn order to cut back on hidden or added sugar , scan the ingredients list of a food label. If you see any of the following terms listed, then sugar has been added to the product in one form or another and it is best left on the shelf at the store\u2014especially if that sugar shows up within the first five ingredients of any food product.\nAgave nectar\n"}, {"score": 911.83105, "uuid": "50f64f5c-527f-544d-9511-7793a704ecec", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1211wb-57-22109", "target_hostname": "healthpsych.psy.vanderbilt.edu", "target_uri": "http://healthpsych.psy.vanderbilt.edu/2008/SugarKids.htm", "page_rank": 1.179913e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Is <em>sugar</em> the culprit?", "snippet": "Diabetes and obesity epidemics <em>are</em> very noticeable and <em>are</em> spreading to younger age groups <em>than</em> ever seen before.", "explanation": null, "document": "\u00b7 Need for many dental fillings\n\u00b7 Needs to eat within 4 hours of a meal\n\u00b7 Colds/ infections more than once a year\nAppleton states that we can train ourselves to be allergic to wheat and milk through conditioning with sugar, however there was no other scientific basis found to this claim.\nThe proposed mechanism for sugar\u0092s creation of hyperactivity with a subsequent behavioral crash relates to the release of insulin. When blood-sugar levels get high, insulin is produced to clear out the blood. Insulin is fast acting and if a lot is made due to high sugar intake there will be an entire flush of the blood-sugar creating the symptoms of shakiness or sluggishness. This creates a cycle of high and low blood-sugar that causes the child to alter mood (Snyder).\nSugar can also be considered a dieting poison in a way that works opposite of the claim for hyperactivity. Three of the most common relations with sugar are obesity, type II diabetes, and dental cavities. All of these have sound scientific support because sugar has a high caloric value found in a diet that leads to obesity, it raises the insulin levels that relates to type II diabetes, and it is known to affect teeth. A sedentary lifestyle, as opposed to hyperactivity, is most correlated with obesity.\nBehaviorally Harmless\n\u0093Sugar-free diets have no place in the management of children with these [hyperactive] conditions\u0094 ( http://healthlibrary.epnet.com/GetContent.aspx?token=9076b2c9-0730-4f1a-b6fa-5a462bb0a011&chunkiid=157003 ).\nMost of the current studies on sugar show that sugar has no effect on hyperactivity, and if used moderately in the diet can have a beneficial response ( http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,4126,00.html ). The medical field is generally in agreement that sugar does not affect behavior, which often goes against the parental anecdotal evidence. There is clear reasoning for parents\u0092 belief that sugar does have adverse behavior effects. Sugar intake is often closely linked to environment and expectations of the parents which helps to formulate these beliefs. Most often sugary snacks, such as cake or soft drinks, are given to kids in a party or social atmosphere that can cause the high behavioral activity. Also, there has been a correlation between sugar and behavior due to a parent\u0092s self-fulfilling prophecy. They tend to view a child\u0092s behavior as out of control only because they thought it would be due to increased sugar intake. This has been tested using a placebo comparison ( http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/748474.html ). Also, sugar often confounds with other substances that do alter behaviour, such as with caffeine in a soft drink.\nSugar relates to three interdependent relations in the body; blood sugar, serotonin, and beta-endorphin levels. Insulin is the result of high blood sugar. Some experiments have shown that insulin only plays a behavioral role when extreme amounts of sugar are ingested. Insulin kicks in strongly if a lot of sugar is present in the diet and causes the high and crash as previously noted. Serotonin is a neurochemical that actually is known to quiet the brain. It is often talked about in regards to stress, because low levels can cause depression and overwhelming feelings. Sugar can actually cause some increases creating feelings of well-being and peacefulness. Lastly, beta-endorphins are \u0093the brain\u0092s own pain killer.\u0094 In children that are very sugar sensitive, there are lower levels of Beta-endorphins which can cause greater issues with physical and emotional pain. However, with normal children, beta-endorphins do not experience a strong change due to sugar ( http://health.kaboose.com/nutrition/too-much-sugar-3.html ).\nModeration is the key when incorporating sugar into a child\u0092s diet. There have been studies that sugar cravings are a learned behavior and therefore intake should be limited to prevent adverse health problems outside hyperactivity. Sugars calming effects can actually be beneficial, giving justice to the phrase \u0093a spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down.\u0094 In babies, a half teaspoon of sugar added to an ounce of water can have extreme calming effects.\nWhat the Scientists Say\nMany studies have been published since the Feingold diet in 1973. Multiple experiments have provided the public with a resounding answer that no, sugar is not to blame for your child\u0092s hyperactive behavior. These studies use large samples and thorough research criteria to justify answers to the lingering questions of parents.\nHoover and Milich (1994) wanted to test if it was truly behavior that was changing or if it was merely parent\u0092s expectancies when children ate a high sugar content diet. Their method involved telling mothers that their children had just received large doses of sugar even though they had not actually been administered sucrose. From there, parents were to report using a rating scale to test hyperactivity. Mothers who were told their child had received the sugar consistently reported their children as having higher activity in comparison to their own baseline as well as compared to other parents who had not been told their children received sucrose. This study gave truth to the idea that expectancies played a major role in the sugar myth.\nFurther research took on the challenge of testing sucrose and aspartame effects by comparing them to saccharin as a placebo. It was found that \u0093even when intake exceeds typical dietary levels, neither dietary sucrose nor aspartame affects children\u0092s behavior or cognitive function\u0094 (Murray 1994).\nThe article from Nutrition Reviews adds more specific research to Murray\u0092s observations. First, a study was done to test the initial proposal that sugar played a role with ADHD (Prinz 1991). Using a rating system he had devised to measure movement, restlessness, and destructive-aggressive acts, behavior was gauged in comparison with a high and low sugar diet. After distributing the meal plan, it was found that there was a correlation with sugar causing greater activity in children with ADHD, but not any correlation in normal children. However, Nutrition Reviews also mentions a study in which data was collected with various levels of sugar and multiple sweeteners such as aspartame (Wolraich 1994). The levels were compared to a placebo, saccharin. This study was carried out very well, administering a variety of diets and implementing a double blind system. The study had all other foods taken out of the 48 tested households, involved the use of a journal to track what was eaten, and utilized the input of teachers and parents to aid in tracking. This result produced the clear response that sugar has no effect on behavior. In a similar study by Brown & Fox (1999), it was found that the only effects were on nutritious value (empty calories) and tooth decay. Neither sucrose nor aspartame affected concentration or behavior.\nThe most conclusive results can be seen in a meta-analysis performed by Wolraich, Wilson, and White (1995) from Vanderbilt University. They compiled a total of 23 within-subject design studies using strong inclusion factors. These included that specific sugar quantities had to be stated in the intervention, an artificial sweetener was to be used as a placebo, the experiment was run blindly, and the report had to have measures with significant computations. The result was the definite finding that sugar does not affect the behavior or cognitive performance of children.\nConclusion\nThere is major conflicting information present to parents on the effects of sugar on behavior, in particular hyperactivity. Sugar can be viewed in two ways, negative or neutral, but never entirely positive due to its presence with health problems including obesity, type II diabetes, and dental problems (cavities). Sugar is not something that can be plausibly removed entirely from the diet, but should be added for energy and in moderation because it is a source of empty calories.\nParents generally believe that the sugary soft drink or large chocolate chip cookie is what is sending their child off the wall. Studies in mice confirm that an increase in yeast production can cause gastrointestinal permeability that creates hyperactivity. Also, books can be cited that relate lowered academic performance with increased sugar intake. Diets exist to reduce and even abolish the use of sugar in diet for these reasons and many other adverse health affects.\nThis data has been contested by clear and well devised studies that have proven that it in fact is not the sugar that is creating the so-called high. Instead, behavior is often correlated to the environment in which the sugar is administered and the parent\u0092s expectancies of behavior based on the ingestion of sugar. The evidence shows no correlation with the hyperactive behavior and sugar, presented through numerous rating classifications, food diaries, and the control vs. experimental diet interventions\nThough parents still tend to believe that their kids are on a high after that piece of cake, there is now definitive data that proves this thought a myth. The sugar confound with environment and expectations makes the idea of hyperactivity by diet seem plausible, however this is clearly not the case. I believe the treatment of complete sugar removal seems ridiculous because many of those problems are rooted in other issues that may relate to sugar, but it is not the physical substance that is causing the problem. In general, moderation is key to prevent the actual negative health problems. In conclusion, sugar does not cause hyperactivity in almost every case.\nReferences\nAppleton, N. (2007, July 14).

Caramelization is the process of cooking sugar, to the browning stage. During saut\u00e9ing, sugar helps brown vegetables and enhances their flavor. Sugar also increases the browning of meats, adding a depth of flavor to stew dishes featuring well-browned meat. Add sugar judiciously to saut\u00e9ed vegetables and meats. Sucrose begins to brown at 338\u00b0F. Most foods will brown only on the outside and only through dry-heat methods (saut\u00e9ing, roasting, grilling or broiling), which reach the high temperatures at which browning occurs. Foods cooked with moist-heat methods alone, as in some poached and braised recipes, do not become hot enough to brown or caramelize.\nBarbecue Sauces\nSugar enhances or brings out the flavors that are already in the barbecue sauce. It enhances the tomato, vinegar or lime flavors that may be present in the sauces. Through its ability to caramelize, sugar also contributes to the browning process, which an artificial sweetener can't do.\nSugar has an optimum taste between 100\u00b0F and 125\u00b0F and tastes better when heated. Because sugar can withstand high temperatures, it is a good choice for barbecue sauces. Additionally, sugar provides superior taste, consistency and performance over other sweeteners in barbecue sauce applications.\nReturn to top\nGlazing Vegetables\nSugar creates a shiny, savory glaze on cooked vegetables. Glazing refers to cooking vegetables in a small amount of liquid (stock or water, usually with a little sugar and butter) over medium-low heat until the vegetables release juices, then reducing the liquid until it's thick. Sugar tenderizes the vegetables and helps create a shiny, savory glaze.\nReturn to top\nSauces and Salad Dressings\nSugar balances sour, bitter and spicy components in hot and cold applications. Sour sensations come from acids such as lemon or lime juice, tomato products and vinegars. Salty sensations come from sodium chloride and other salts. Bitterness is a reaction to alkaloids such as quinine and caffeine. The body is more tolerant of sweet sensations than sour, bitter or salty ones. The addition of sweetness to sour, salty and bitter foods can make them taste better. That's why sugar is added to acidic dressings, salty brine solutions and coffee.\nThe interaction of taste and temperature produces various flavor sensations. Sucrose has an optimum taste between 100\u00b0F and 125\u00b0F. Fructose, the major component of honey, exhibits poor sweetening ability when hot, yet tastes very sweet in cold preparations.\nReturn to top\nBrining\nSugar softens and balances the flavor of delicate fish, poultry or meat in brine solutions. A brine is a very salty marinade that tenderizes foods, adds flavor and moisture, and reduces cooking time. Most brines have approximately 20% salinity or 1 pound salt per gallon water. Brines often contain sugar, herbs and spices. Other additions can include wine, beer, fruit juices and vinegar.\nThe chemistry behind brining is simple: Meat naturally contains salt water. By immersing meat in a liquid with a higher concentration of salt, the liquid (and its flavorings) is absorbed into the meat. The sugar in a brine also draws out some blood remaining in raw fish, beef and poultry. The longer a food is brined, the stronger the flavor will be. Poultry and seafood do not need to be brined as long as denser meats. After brining, the meat (or fish or poultry) contains extra moisture which will remain after cooking, producing a moist finished product.\nReturn to top\nSalt Curing\nSugar adds flavor to salt-cured raw foods. Salt curing is the process of surrounding a food with salt or a mixture of salt, sugar, curing salt, herbs and spices. Salt curing dehydrates the raw food, inhibits the growth of bacteria and adds flavor. It preserves meats such as ham and makes it safe to consume raw. Sugar adds a sweet flavor to cured foods and balances the salt flavor. Most often used with pork or fish, salt curing is NOT a quick procedure and must be carefully managed to meet food safety regulations.\nReturn to top\nDry Rubs\nSugar enhances flavor, browning, and crusting of meat, fish, and poultry, and contributes to osmosis during the smoking step in the barbecue process. A dry rub or dry marinade is a mixture of sugar (often white and brown), salt, and crushed herbs or spices that's applied to a protein's surface prior to cooking. Other additions such as minced garlic, onion and grated citrus zest can be added to form a paste which will adhere well to meat, fish or poultry. Unlike a wet marinade, a dry rub remains on the food during cooking.\nA dry rub is an important flavor-building component of smoking, which is the first step in traditional barbecue. Through osmosis, the salt in the rub draws moisture from the surface of the meat. The dry surface, combined with the savory rub, create a crust that adds flavor, texture and eye-appeal to the cooked meat. Sugar contributes to osmosis and so to the creation of the crust as well as caramelization and flavor enhancement.\nDry rubs are recommended over marinating for large pieces of meat such as briskets and pork butts because a dry rub will not sear or burn on the grill the way marinades can during the long, slow cooking required for these large cuts. Marinades primarily flavor the surface of meats, and that's sufficient for small cuts, which have large surface areas; but large meat cuts, with their smaller surface-to-interior ratios, benefit from the deeper flavor penetration of rubs.\nReturn to top\nPickling\nSugar balances acid flavor and helps maintain the texture of pickled vegetables. Pickling means preserving food in a brine or vinegar solution. It is one of the oldest methods of food preservation, perhaps starting with the Chinese in the 3rd century.\nPickled vegetables can be brined (fermented), which involves curing at room temperature for several weeks. Or pickles can be \"quick\" (unfermented), made in a day or two by adding vinegar to the brine solution. It's critical to add enough vinegar to prevent bacterial growth.\nSugar is an important component in pickling. Besides balancing the flavor of the vinegar, sugar helps strengthen vegetable cell structures and makes vegetable fibers firmer. Either brown or white sugar can be used. Brown sugar produces a darker brine.\nReturn to top\nBread Coatings\nSugar speeds browning in bread coatings. A combination of sugar and protein in a coating spurs browning. However, sugar must be carefully incorporated into a breading formula. Too much sugar can cause an onion ring coating, for example, to become overly brown before the onion has cooked.\n"}, {"score": 903.2919, "uuid": "398aafb2-684e-530b-b513-26ec96677d18", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0101wb-80-23549", "target_hostname": "www.chsugar.com", "target_uri": "http://www.chsugar.com/Consumer/ch-light-a-sugar-and-stevia-blend.html", "page_rank": 1.1826844e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "C&amp;H Light A <em>Sugar</em> &amp; Stevia Blend", "snippet": "By blending pure cane C&amp;H\u00ae <em>Sugar</em> with a naturally sweet extract from the stevia plant, we have created a delicious <em>sweetener</em> with no <em>artificial</em> ingredients.

Now there's C&H\u00ae Light \u0096 a 100% natural sugar blend with half the calories of sugar. By blending pure cane sugar with the zero-calorie, naturally sweet extract from the stevia plant, and a natural flavor to enhance the taste, C&H\u00ae has created a delicious light sweetener with no artificial ingredients.\nThe tropical stevia plant, originally discovered in the warm highlands of South America, has been used for centuries as a sweetener. C&H\u00ae Light is made from the extract of this stevia plant and then blended with another one of nature's pure sweet plants, the sugar cane. Our balance of sugar cane and stevia extract creates the ideal sweetener \u0096 a perfect sweet taste and half the calories of sugar!\nBaking with C&H\u00ae Light\nBaking with C&H\u00ae Light sugar is easy\u0096\nReplace 1 cup of Sugar with 1/2 cup of C&H Light.\nThe difference is exactly half, making it simple to convert favorite recipes. Although, since you are baking with a sugar and stevia blend, you may notice a few minor differences in your baking. If you want to make slight adjustments to your recipe for the best possible results, follow these tips:\nColor \u0096 Sugar is needed in baking to form a nice golden color in baked goods. Since there is less sugar in C&H\u00ae Light, the color of baked items may be lighter. So don't go by color alone when baking with C&H\u00ae Light.\nMoisture and Texture \u0096 Sugar adds volume and helps to retain moisture to cakes so if you are using a cake, or cake-like recipe, such as brownies, you may notice that when baked with C&H\u00ae Light the cake will be a little denser than the original recipe. To compensate:\nIncrease the size of the baking pan, which will decrease the baking time and temperature, helping to retain moisture.\nAdd an additional egg to the recipe.\nIncorporating nuts helps to add air into your cakes, making them lighter in texture.\nUse oil, margarine or vegetable shortening or a combination of these, instead of butter.\nIncrease the liquid content of the recipe slightly.\nConsider flavors when baking with C&H\u00ae Light\nThe stevia plant extract naturally has a slight licorice-like essence. C&H has added a natural flavor to balance the C&H\u00ae Light for baking and sweetening foods where you want other flavors to come through stronger. Chocolate and cinnamon are flavors of choice when baking with C&H\u00ae Light. Also try combining your recipes with natural fruits: bananas, oranges, apples and pears. We also recommend avoiding recipes that call for tart or sharp flavors such as lemon, lime, pineapple or mint.\nMaking Beverages with C&H\u00ae Light\nWhether you use the 5-calorie packets or a teaspoon from the C&H\u00ae Light bag, it is the perfect sweetener to use in beverages and to help cut back on calories. It easily dissolves and mixes into both cold and hot drinks. Use it for sweetening iced teas, a fresh fruit punch and it is also great for making fruit smoothies!\nFAQs about C&H\u00ae Light\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0What is Stevia?\nStevia is an herb, native to the highlands of South America. The extract from the leaves of a stevia plant can be crystallized and turned into a powder or a liquid sweetener. It is 200 times sweeter than granulated sugar. Alone, stevia extract is all natural, has no calories and is naturally sweet.\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0Is C&H Light safe for people with diabetes?\nStevia alone does not have an impact on blood sugar levels, however C&H\u00ae Light is a blend of granulated sugar and stevia extract, so it is best to consult your personal physician before consuming this sweetener.\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0How do I store C&H\u00ae Light?\nYou can store C&H\u00ae Light just as you would store granulated sugar. Be sure C&H\u00ae Light is kept sealed and stored in a cool, dry place.\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0Does C&H\u00ae Light have an expiration date?\nC&H\u00ae Light Sugar & Stevia blend products have been given a one-year shelf life from the pack date. However, if stored properly, it can last considerably longer.\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0Why do you blend stevia with sugar?\nStevia naturally has a licorice-like flavor which can leave a bitter aftertaste when added to foods and beverages. To balance out the aftertaste, we created a perfect blend of stevia with cane sugar and a natural flavoring.\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0How much stevia is used in C&H\u00ae Light?\nSince C&H\u00ae Light is a proprietary blend of sugar and stevia, we are not at liberty to share the particulars with the public. C&H\u00ae Light is an all natural, reduced calorie sweetener that has met with all FDA regulations and contains no known allergens.\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0What is the difference in baked goods made with cane sugar compared to those baked with a sugar and stevia blend?\nCane sugar plays a major role in baking. While you can replace the sweetness, you can never fully replace all the functions of sugar, such as browning, volume or texture.

Once this happens, there is no way to adequately restore it. Always store granulated sugar in a covered container in a cool, dry area.\nRelated Links\n"}, {"score": 902.61176, "uuid": "67a5065b-e0e1-536f-a6c0-98acc31755e6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1810wb-81-13871", "target_hostname": "anbmall.com", "target_uri": "http://anbmall.com/articles/106-article/720-sugar-showdown-finding-healthier-substitutes-for-your-sweet-tooth", "page_rank": 2.242963e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "<em>Sugar</em> Showdown!

You\u2019ve likely been hearing a new term called Diabesity, which encompasses the intricate relationship between sugar, diabetes, and obesity.\nEver since the American Heart Association\u2019s 2009 recommendation to limit our daily consumption of added sugar to between 100 and 150 calories (vs. the 355+ calories that is actually consumed), the link between our overly sugar-laden diets and our ever-expanding waistlines has become painfully clear.\nUnderstanding the potential health consequences of eating too much sugar is one thing, knowing what to do about it is an entirely different story \u2026 Looking at sugar consumption as a long-term health imperative rather than a simple weight management issue might give you the motivation you need to tackle it. Start with small manageable steps and work up from there.\nFirst, aim to significantly reduce your consumption of (and eventually eliminate) highly processed sugars like corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup \u2013which can be addicting and wreak havoc with your blood sugar levels.\nThe next step (which can also be taken simultaneously) is to substitute whole grains for white flour and add more raw fruits and vegetables. After that, try to uncover all the hidden sources of added sugar that may be sabotaging your best intentions, and find healthier alternatives. I\u2019m talking about sugar that\u2019s added to less obvious things like peanut butter and spaghetti sauces, and frozen, canned, or other packaged foods. Avoid fruit juices with added sugar and watch out for those flavored yogurts that boast only 150 calories per serving! Some of those tiny containers have as much as 45 or 50 grams of sugar per serving!\nLast, but not least, become a savvy consumer of alternative sweeteners. The marketplace for alternative and especially natural sweeteners has exploded over the past few years, but with no practical means to evaluate all the options, the average consumer still turns to artificial sweeteners like NutraSweet, Equal, or Splenda, as low-calorie solutions to manage their weight.\nThe problem with artificial sweeteners is they may actually contribute to obesity because they trick the body into thinking they\u2019re sugar molecules. When the tongue and brain recognize sugar the body produces insulin. Excess insulin in the body is converted into fat, leading to weight gain. Several studies support this finding while others conclude that Aspartame, for example, may be neuro-toxic under certain conditions and should be avoided altogether.\nSo how can you work your way through the maze of alternative sweeteners (natural and synthetic) to find the right substitute? Here are some quick tips to help you get started:\nCompare Glycemic Index Scores. Look first and foremost for the impact of a sweetener on your blood sugar levels. The easiest way is to find its Glycemic Index (GI) score and compare it to that of white sugar (68). The Glycemic Index basically measures how fast carbohydrates convert to glucose in the blood. The higher the number the faster the conversion. Lower numbers are better. Honey is in the 70s, maple syrup is around 55 and high fructose corn syrup is just above 90, while palm sugar is around 35 and agave nectar is in the low teens.\nA Sugar By Any Other Name. Make sure that your sweetener of choice isn\u2019t simply another version of white sugar. Most of the sugar in the food and beverages that people purchase at the supermarket is refined cane sugar. Evaporated sugar cane juice is simply the solid that remains when sugar cane juice evaporates. It\u2019s considered less refined than white sugar but has the same GI score so avoid products made with this sweetener.\nWeigh Pros & Cons. Not all natural sweeteners are created equal. Some have better GI scores than sugar but no nutritive benefits. Others like Molasses, are high in minerals and antioxidants but not suitable for broad use as a sweetener. Stevia has added health benefits, almost no calories, and a GI score of zero, but sometimes leaves a bitter after taste. Sugar alcohols like Xylitol and Erythritol are very low in calories and have dental health benefits but are not natural and if eaten in excess, can have a laxative effect.\nContext, Texture and Taste. Find out which natural sweeteners work best for sweetening beverages and which work best for cooking and baking. Many times, these may not be one and the same. Erythritol and Stevia are often recommended for sweetening beverages, while Brown Rice Syrup (made from sprouted brown rice) and Agave tend to work better for baked goods. Keep in mind, the latter are liquids so they can\u2019t be used spoon for spoon as a substitute for table sugar in recipes.\nAbove all, stay open minded and willing to experiment with different types and brands of sweeteners, until you find the right combination for your particular needs. Remember to balance your taste buds\u2019 needs with your body\u2019s overall health needs and don\u2019t rely strictly on substitutes as a way of managing your weight or your blood sugar levels. Try to get most of your sugar from natural sources and limit the amount of sugar per serving to 12 grams or less.\nCopyright 2010 Dropwise Essentials\nDonya Fahmy, is a green business owner and the creator of Dropwise Essentials' spa-quality aromatherapy body products that help you safely relieve stress, increase vitality, improve confidence, or simply manage your emotional state any time or place without popping a pill.

View all columns in series\nWhile visiting friends, I bonded immediately with their two-year old son, Robbie. We played while the adults talked. After about an hour he got hungry and asked his mother for some of his favorite food, peanut butter.\nRobbie ate 4 teaspoons straight from the jar and within minutes he turned into a whirling dervish, a cyclone of hyperactivity. He was banging his head against a pillow on my lap one minute and the next tearing down the hall to throw toys around his room. The parents seemed all too familiar with this behavior and began making excuses. He gets like this when we have company, when he's overtired, when he's excited.\nAs a doctor, I immediately knew what the problem was - sugar. Robbie's parents had already figured out that indulging his sweet tooth lead to hyperactive episodes. But they didn't make the connection between the peanut butter and the behavior. I took the jar and showed them the label, which listed two different sugars (high fructose corn syrup and sugar). The parents were stunned and said they would be more diligent about cutting out the hidden sugars in their son's diet. When my husband saw Robbie's father a week later, he said Robbie was much calmer, was sleeping better, and was like a different person both at home and at daycare.\nMost people do realize that sugar can cause hyperactivity, but what they don't realize is that sugar lurks where you least expect to find it and affects the human body in myriad ways. The sugar industry vehemently denies that sugar is hazardous to human health. Are the parallel increases in sugar consumption, obesity, and diabetes just a coincidence? Here are the straight answers.\nI know sugar can lead to weight gain, but is it really all that bad for me?\nYes, it really is. Sugar is a simple carbohydrate found naturally in many foods, including fruits and grains. If the only sugar we consumed were in natural, whole foods, we'd all be just fine. But the average American diet is full of refined, nutrient-depleted foods and contains an average of 20 teaspoons of added, refined sugar every day. That's twice the amount recommended by the USDA (10 teaspoons and four times the maximum I personally recommend.)\nSo what's wrong with refined sugar? Many things. First, sugar compromises immune function. Two cans of soda (which contain 24 teaspoons of sugar) reduce the efficiency of white blood cells by 92 percent - an effect that lasts up to five hours, according to Kenneth Bock, M.D., an expert in nutritional and environmental health. Since white blood cells are an integral part of your immune system, if you happen to meet a nasty virus or bacteria within five hours of drinking a few colas, your immune system may be unable to fight off the invader.\nRefined sugar also overworks the pancreas and adrenal glands as they struggle to keep the blood sugar levels in balance. When you eat sugar, it is quickly absorbed into your blood stream in the form of glucose. This puts your pancreas into overdrive, making insulin (which carries glucose to your cells to be used for energy) to normalize blood sugar levels. But this rapid release of insulin causes a sudden drop in blood sugar. In reaction to the falling blood sugar, excess adrenal cortisone is stimulated to raise blood sugar back to normal. A constantly high intake of simple dietary sugar keeps this roller coaster going and eventually overworks or \"burns out\" normal pancreas and adrenal function leading to early menopause, adult-onset diabetes, hypoglycemia, and chronic fatigue.\nThe purpose of eating is to provide your body with nutrients. But since sugar is devoid of nutrients, the body must actually draw from its nutrient reserves to metabolize it. When these storehouses are depleted, the body becomes unable to properly metabolize fatty acids and cholesterol, leading to higher cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Drawing on the body's nutrient reserves can also lead to chronic mineral deficits, especially in magnesium (a mineral required for more than 300 different enzyme activities) and chromium (a trace element that regulates hormones such as insulin), putting you at risk for dozens of diseases, from depression to attention deficit disorder to asthma.\nA recent study, for example, found that kids who eat significant amounts of junk food are much more likely to develop asthma than kids who don't eat junk food. While the researchers didn't tie asthma to sugar itself, they did point out that a diet full of candy and other highly processed junk foods is deficient in a number of nutrients essential to health. And as I explained earlier, such foods further deplete the body of nutrients once consumed.\nIn fact, children are the biggest consumers of nutritionally void junk food at a time when their brains and bodies are growing rapidly and in need of a nutrient-dense diet for proper development, both physically and mentally. Criminologist Stephen Schoenthaler has been conducting nutritional studies on delinquents and public school children for almost thirty years. In a paper from 1986 he describes how one million kids improved their test scores when they eliminated sugar and white flour from their diets.\nAlexander Schauss, Ph.D., a nutritional researcher and writer, performed similar work in juvenile detention centers and showed that violent behavior decreased dramatically when sugar was eliminated.\nBut I don't eat junk food. Why should I be concerned about my sugar consumption?\nUnless you're eating a diet entirely made of whole, unprocessed foods (think fruits, vegetables, grains), you're probably eating more sugar than you think, and than you should. Sugar, in its myriad forms, is added to virtually every packaged food product you'll find at the supermarket - not just the sweet stuff. If you drink one soda, even the \"natural\" variety, used up your day's sugar allowance.)\nDon't be fooled by the ingredients list. Sugar has hundreds of pseudonyms (see \"Stealth Sugars,\" for a sampling), and manufacturers have gotten very good at hiding them from consumers. Because ingredients are listed from most to least amount, often three different types of sugars will be in the middle of the list. If all sugars were required to be listed together, sugar would be the first ingredient.\nTo find out how much sugar you're actually taking in, try keeping a food diary for one week. Check the labels of the foods you eat and make note of their sugar content. The reality of the numbers may not hit home because most of us don't think in grams - 4.2 g of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar. At the end of the week, take the total number of sugar grams and divide it by 4.2 to get your weekly sugar intake in teaspoons. Then divide that number by 7 to get your daily sugar consumption.\nUnfortunately, the way the FDA's labeling rules are set up, manufacturers don't have to separate added sugars from naturally occurring ones on labels. But your total sugar intake will give you a very good idea of how much added sugar you're eating. Naturally sweet foods, such as fruit, don't really contain that much sugar. A cup of strawberries, for example, contains 1/6th the sugar of a can of cola.\nIs there such a thing as a safe amount of sugar?\nIdeally, you should eliminate all refined sugar from your diet. I'm aware do realize that such a feat may not be realistic for everyone, particularly since a large number of the foods you find at the grocery store have been made with refined sugars (plus the fact that nutrition labels don't have to list the amount of added sugars a product contains).\nMany people subscribe to the bizarre logic that if they overindulge in sweets and don't wake up the next day with diabetes or some horrible disease then it must be okay. Dr. Abraham Hoffer, a psychiatrist in British Columbia who has been studying the effects of sugar on health for more than 40 years, says that it takes roughly 15- 20 years of steady consumption of refined sugar and junk food before an individual develops a chronic illness like diabetes. And it doesn't take a lot of sugar to put you at risk. Hoffer's statistics show that once intake exceeds 20 teaspoons daily, the risk of chronic disease increases exponentially.\nIf you can't completely cut sugar from your diet, due to eating out and not being in control of ingredients, try not to ingest more than two or three teaspoons a day. That way you will stay well below 70 pounds annually (20 teaspoons daily) which is the cut off point for sugar-induced chronic disease. At the level we're eating sugar now (20 teaspoons per person daily), it is only a matter of time before we're facing an epidemic of sugar-induced diseases. In fact, the epidemics may have already begun - according to the Centers for Disease control in Atlanta, the incidence of adult-onset diabetes, has increased by 70 percent among people in their 30s in the past 10 years.\nWhat does processing do to sugar?\nProcessing sugarcane, or any whole food, strips it of most if not all of its nutritional value. Researchers found that the refining process of sugar removes 93 percent of its chromium, 89 percent of its manganese, 98 percent of its cobalt, 83 percent of its copper, 98 percent of its zinc, and 98 percent of its magnesium. Ironically, the end product, the refined sugar, is what we consume, while the nutritious residues are discarded and generally fed to cattle.\nIn the 1920s, Sir Frederick Banting, the Canadian medical researcher scientist, who first discovered insulin, visited Panama to study diabetes among workers in the sugar cane fields. He could find almost no incidence of diabetes among the workers who ate the whole sugarcane plant daily. But among their Spanish employers - who incorporated the refined end product, white sugar, into their diets - the disease was rampant.\nIs fructose healthier than sugar?\nMany people mistakenly believe that fructose is a healthier sugar - especially since it is used in many so-called \"natural\" foods. While there is a small amount of fructose naturally present in fruit, the fructose that is added to many commercially prepared foods is nearly as refined as plain white sugar.\nMost of the fructose you'll encounter is in the form of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which has nearly eclipsed sugar as the most consumed sweetener in the United States. It is added to thousands of products, from cola to cookies and even to canned vegetables. HFCS is a highly refined sweetener that is virtually identical, chemically speaking, to refined white sugar; during digestion sugar breaks down into equal parts of glucose and fructose; HFCS contains 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose.\nWhy do I crave sugar?\nYou may crave sugary foods for many reasons. As I explained earlier, refined sugar stresses the pancreas and depletes the body's supplies of chromium. A common symptom of chromium deficiency is sugar cravings. And satisfying these cravings further lowers chromium and increases cravings. And eating sweets is just plain pleasurable. Chocolate, for example, has been found to stimulate the production of serotonin, the feel-good brain chemical.\nBut the human body is drawn to carbohydrates for reasons other than instant gratification. Carbohydrates are necessary for metabolic processes in our body. Whole, unrefined carbohydrates like grains break down into sugar when chewed. After proper chewing, grains will taste sweet. Grains contain B vitamins and magnesium, these nutrients are important co-factors in hundreds of metabolic processes in the body. And the sweetness of the foods that contain B-vitamins and magnesium may create a conditioned response to these foods. In other words, sweetness makes your body think you are getting beneficial vitamins and minerals. But when we get empty carbs like sugar with no other nutrients\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe body craves more and more to try to meet its nutrient demands.\nSo, if your body needs these vitamins and minerals and is attracted to carbohydrates to get them, and if instead of a whole grain you eat a refined empty product, then you will probably keep craving carbohydrates until you get the vitamins and minerals you need. That's why many doctors recommend B-complex vitamins and magnesium supplements help to control carbohydrate addiction. Of course, eating organic whole grains would be the optimum solution.\nThe main reason for our sugar cravings it that we've had a lifetime of refined sugar. It's in baby food, snacks and treats at every turn; Madison Avenue is able to sell 10 cents worth of junk food for $2.00 because it appeals to our sweet tooth. We're hooked and we're not complaining as long as the supply holds out. And as Dr. Hoffer says it's a stronger addiction than heroin.\nAnother cause of sugar cravings is a yeast overgrowth, also known as candidaisis. Candida is a yeast that is naturally present in the human body. But some things, such as antibiotics and too much sugar in the diet, can cause the yeast to multiply, leading a number of health problems, from vaginal yeast infections to severe fatigue. And these yeast, when present in abnormally high numbers, can cause strong cravings for sweet, starchy foods, causing the problem to perpetuate. (If you suspect a yeast overgrowth, your doctor can perform a saliva or stool test for yeast antibodies.) (Dr. Dean is the medical advisor to yeastconnection.com. Visitors to the site can take the Yeast Questionnaire to help determine if they have a yeast problem. If so, a 6-Point Yeast Fighting Program will help eliminate the sugar and yeast from your life.)\nAre natural sweeteners like honey better than white sugar?\nRegardless of what kind of sweeteners you eat, they should account for no more than 5 percent of your daily calories. Some natural sweeteners, such as blackstrap molasses, unprocessed honey, fruit juice, brown rice syrup, and evaporated cane juice do contain low levels of nutrients, such as the B vitamins, and minerals such as iron, calcium and potassium. But don't be fooled, these \"natural\" sweeteners are only marginally better than plain white table sugar and dietary intake of them should be limited.\nWhat about calorie-free sugar substitutes such as Nutrasweet? Sweet N' Low? Don't be fooled into switching from sugar to sugar-free substitutes; they're even more unhealthy, especially aspartame (Nutrasweet). If you want to add a touch of sweetness without any calories, try stevia*. Stevia is an extremely safe herb that is not only an excellent sweetener, but it actually lowers blood sugar levels in diabetics by helping to regulate pancreatic function. And unlike sugar, which weakens the immune system, stevia has antimicrobial properties and actually helps the body fight off colds and flus.\nAspartame (Nutrasweet),on the other hand, is a neurotoxin and should be avoided like the plague. Aspartame has been shown to cause birth defects, brain tumors and seizures and to contribute to diabetes and emotional disorders.\nAspartame has three components: phenylalanine (50 percent), aspartic acid (40 percent) and methanol, also termed wood alcohol (10 percent). Those in support of this popular artificial sweetener, state that the two primary amino acids, which comprise 90 percent of aspartame by weight, are a harmless and natural part of our diet. While phenylalanine and aspartic acid are naturally occurring amino acids, our bodies and brains are not equipped to handle such high concentrations as found in a diet soda where they disrupt nerve cell communication and can cause cell death. The neurotoxic effects of these isolated amino acids can be linked to headaches, mental confusion, balance problems and seizures.\nMethanol, too, is naturally present in fruits and vegetables but these foods also contain ethanol, which neutralizes the methanol. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines safe consumption of methanol as no more than 7.8 mg per day of this dangerous substance. Yet a one-liter beverage, sweetened with aspartame, contains about 56 milligrams of wood alcohol, or seven times the EPA limit. And the absolute irony of the use of aspartame in diet products is that it can actually cause weight gain. Phenylalanine and aspartic acid, found in aspartame, stimulate the release of insulin. Rapid, strong spikes in insulin remove all glucose from the blood stream and store it as fat. This can result in hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and sugar cravings. Additionally, phenylalanine has been demonstrated to inhibit carbohydrate-induced synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which signals that the body is full. This can cause you to eat more than your normally would and, ultimately, gain weight. In one study a control group switching to an aspartame-free diet resulted in an average weight loss of 19 pounds.\nSaccharin is a petroleum-derived sweetener discovered in 1879 and was used extensively during the sugar shortages during World Wars I and II. The sweetener got a bad reputation in l977 when the FDA proposed restrictions on its use saying studies involving male rats given large amounts of saccharin developed urinary bladder tumors. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) then officially classified saccharin as an \"anticipated human carcinogen.\" But researchers have since been unable to reproduce the results from 1977, and saccharin was recently removed from the NTP's list. Saccharin might be the lesser of two evils, but it's still a synthetic substance.)\nMany low-carbohydrate foods, like the Atkins Bars, contain sugar alcohols. What are they?\nStealth Sugars\nIt sometimes requires a little detective work to find the hidden sugars in foods. You probably know the \"ose\"s (maltose, sucrose, glucose, fructose), but there are dozes more that you'd never suspect. The following is a list of 100 common names for sugar that you may encounter in ingredients of your favorite foods.\nAmasake\n"}, {"score": 895.311, "uuid": "2b94cfd7-8cc3-5f6c-9986-40e8b11c9f7c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0606wb-56-08951", "target_hostname": "www.todaysdietitian.com", "target_uri": "http://www.todaysdietitian.com/news/031611_news.shtml", "page_rank": 1.1708989e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Why Taste Cells Love <em>Sugar</em> So Much", "snippet": "that allows taste cells to detect many sweet compounds, including <em>sugars</em> such as glucose and sucrose and also <em>artificial</em> <em>sweeteners</em>, including saccharin and aspartame.", "explanation": null, "document": "Professional\u00a0Growth\nWhy Taste Cells Love Sugar So Much\nA new research study dramatically increases knowledge of how taste cells detect sugars, a key step in developing strategies to limit overconsumption. Scientists from the Monell Center and collaborators have discovered that taste cells have several additional sugar detectors other than the previously known sweet receptor.\n\u201cDetecting the sweetness of nutritive sugars is one of the most important tasks of our taste cells,\u201d says senior author Robert F. Margolskee, MD, PhD, a molecular neurobiologist at Monell. \u201cMany of us eat too much sugar and to help limit overconsumption, we need to better understand how a sweet taste cell \u00e2\u0080\u0098knows\u2019 something is sweet.\u201d\nScientists have known for some time that the T1r2+T1r3 receptor is the primary mechanism that allows taste cells to detect many sweet compounds, including sugars such as glucose and sucrose and also artificial sweeteners, including saccharin and aspartame.\nHowever, some aspects of sweet taste could not be explained by the T1r2+T1r3 receptor. For example, although the receptor contains two subunits that must join together for it to work properly, Margolskee\u2019s team had previously found that mice engineered to be missing the T1r3 subunit were still able to taste glucose and other sugars normally.\nKnowing that sugar sensors in the intestine are important to how dietary sugars are detected and absorbed, and that metabolic sensors in the pancreas are key to regulating blood levels of glucose, the Monell scientists used advanced molecular and cellular techniques to see if these same sensors are also found in taste cells.\nThe results, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, indicate that several sugar sensors from intestine and pancreas also are present in exactly those same sweet-sensing taste cells that have the T1r2+T1r3 sweet receptor.\n\u201cThe taste system continues to amaze me at how smart it is and how it serves to integrate taste sensation with digestive processes,\u201d says Margolskee.\nThe different sugar taste sensors may have varied roles. An intestinal glucose sensor also found to be located in the sweet-sensitive taste cells may provide an explanation for another mystery of sweet taste: why just a pinch of table salt tastes sweet or salt added to baked goods enhances sweet taste. Known as SGLT1, this sensor is a transporter that moves glucose into the sweet taste cell when sodium is present, thus triggering the cell to register sweetness.\nIn pancreas, the sugar sensor known as the KATP channel, monitors glucose levels and triggers insulin release when they rise. The authors speculate that KATP may function in sweet taste cells to modulate taste cell sensitivity to sugars according to metabolic needs. For example, this sensor may respond to hormonal signals from the gut or pancreas to make taste cells less responsive to sweets after we have just eaten a sugary piece of pecan pie and do not need additional energy.\n\u201cSweet taste cells have turned out to be quite complex. The presence of the KATP channel suggests that taste cells may play a role in regulating our sensitivity to sweet taste under different nutritional conditions,\u201d says first author Karen K. Yee, PhD, a cellular physiologist at Monell. \u201cThis knowledge may someday help us understand how to limit overconsumption of sweet foods.\u201d\nSource: Monell Chemical Senses Center\nindustry\u00a0news\njobs\nsearch\n"}]]}
