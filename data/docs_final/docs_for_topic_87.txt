The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that only about 7 percent of employees currently covered by employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) will have to switch to subsidized-exchange policies in 2014. However, our early-2011 survey of more than 1,300 employers across industries, geographies, and employer sizes, as well as other proprietary research, found that reform will provoke a much greater response.\"\nPaul Winfree, The Heritage Foundation\nTue, 2011-05-24\n\"One of the key components of ObamaCare, tax subsidies to purchase federally approved health insurance, will substantially increase the number of people who are not paying for government services and thus have a lower incentive to be concerned about record-breaking government spending. These tax subsidies, which take effect in 2014, will also harm the economy by increasing the national deficit and by creating huge marginal tax rates that will discourage productivity for many households. Obamacare\u2019s tax subsidies are one of the primary reasons to repeal Obamacare.\"\nThomas Saving & John Goodman, Health Affairs\nThu, 2011-05-12\n\"Basically, hospitals will not be able to provide seniors with the same kind of services they provide younger patients. To survive, we may see hospitals specialize in Medicare patients and provide far fewer amenities. In some cases, they may offer reduced access to expensive technology. A private room paid for by Medicare may be replaced by four- or six-bed wards. Menu choices may be replaced by the civilian equivalent of meals-ready-to-eat. Hospitals that accept Medicare patients may have access to MRI scanners, but not PET scanners.\"\nPamela Villarreal and Michael Barba, National Center for Policy Analysis\nTue, 2011-05-10\n\"Beginning in 2014, the Affordable Care Act will expand the mandatory population and require that states make Medicaid available to all individuals, married or single, under the age of 65 with incomes at or below 133 percent of poverty. Although the federal government will provide funds for states to cover this newly eligible population, it will increase the fiscal burden on many states, particularly those that do not already cover expanded optional populations.\"\nBrian Blase, The Heritage Foundation\nThu, 2011-05-05\n\"A variety of research shows that Americans enrolled in Medicaid have less access to health care, and when they do receive care, the quality is often inferior to the care provided to other similar patients. This Heritage Foundation paper lays out the research, and shows how Medicaid is failing current enrollees and taxpayers and must be fundamentally reformed. The Medicaid expansion contained in ObamaCare will further weaken the program\u2014hurting those who really need it, as well as unduly burdening the taxpayers who pay for it.\"\nRobert A. Levy, The Cato Institute\nMon, 2011-04-25\n\"First, the penalty for not buying health insurance is not a tax. Even if the penalty were a tax, it would fail the constitutional requirements for income, excise, or direct taxes. Second, the power to regulate interstate commerce extends only to economic activities; it does not permit Congress to compel such activities in order to regulate them. Third, the mandate is not necessary; indeed, it is merely a means to circumvent problems that would not exist if not for PPACA itself.\"\nPaul Howard, Manhattan Institute\nWed, 2011-04-20\n\"The ACA presents New York policymakers with a unique opportunity to reform its individual and small-group insurance markets. However, creating an effective market-based exchange requires policymakers to recognize that simply imposing its current high-cost insurance arrangements on the exchange may lead to the collapse of the exchange over time. Instead, reforms should build on the lessons learned from state exchanges in Utah and Massachusetts, federal programs such as Medicare Part D, and private exchanges such as New York's HealthPass.\"\nRita Numerof, Ph.D., The Heritage Foundation\nMon, 2011-04-18\n\"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) creates federal 'accountable care organizations' (ACOs).

The US government can assassinate any US citizen that the executive branch thinks could possibly be a \u201cthreat\u201d to the US government, or throw the hapless citizen into a dungeon for the rest of his or her life without presenting any evidence to a court or obtaining a conviction of any crime, or send the \u201cthreat\u201d to a puppet foreign state to be tortured until the \u201cthreat\u201d confesses to a crime that never occurred or dies at the hands of \u201cfreedom and democracy\u201d while professing innocence.\nIt has never been revealed how a single citizen, or any number thereof, could possibly comprise a threat to a government that has a trillion plus dollars to spend each year on security and weapons, the world\u2019s largest navy and air force, 700 plus military bases across the world, large numbers of nuclear weapons, 16 intelligence agencies plus the intelligence agencies of its NATO puppet states and the intelligence service of Israel.\nNevertheless, air travelers are subjected to porno-scanning and sexual groping. Cars traveling on Interstate highways can expect to be stopped, with traffic backed up for miles, while Homeland Security and the federalized state or local police conduct searches.\nI witnessed one such warrantless search on Easter Sunday. The south bound lanes of I-185 heading into Columbus, Georgia, were at a standstill while black SUV and police car lights flashed. US citizens were treated by \u201csecurity\u201d forces that they finance as if they were \u201cterrorists\u201d or \u201cdomestic extremists,\u201d another undefined class of Americans devoid of constitutional protections.\nThese events are Kafkaesque in themselves, but they are ever more so when one considers that these extraordinary violations of the US Constitution fail to be overturned in the Supreme Court. Apparently, American citizens lack standing to defend their civil liberties.\nYet, ObamaCare is before the US Supreme Court. The conservative majority might now utilize the \u201cjudicial activism\u201d for which conservatives have criticized liberals. Hypocrisy should no longer surprise us. However, the fight over ObamaCare is not worth five cents.\nIt is extraordinary that \u201cliberals,\u201d \u201cprogressives,\u201d \u201cDemocrats,\u201d whatever they are, are defending a \u201chealth program\u201d that uses public monies to pay private insurance companies and that raises the cost of health care.\nAmericans have been brainwashed that \u201ca single-payer system is unaffordable\u201d because it is \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d Despite this propaganda, accepted by many Americans, European countries manage to afford single-payer systems. Health care is not a stress, a trauma, an unaffordable expense for European populations. Among the Western Civilized Nations, only the richest, the US, has no universal health care.\nThe American health care system is the most expensive of all on earth. The reason for the extraordinary expense is the multiple of entities that must make profits. The private doctors must make profits. The private testing centers must make profits.The private specialists who receive the referrals from general practitioners must make profits. The private hospitals must make profits. The private insurance companies must make profits. The profits are a huge cost of health care.\nOn top of these profits come the costs of preventing and combatting fraud. Because private insurance companies resist paying and Medicare pays a small fraction of the medical charges, private health care providers charge as much as they possibly can, knowing that the payments will be cut to the bone. But a billing mistake of even $300 can bankrupt a health care provider from legal expenses defending him/her self from fraud accusations.\nThe beauty of a single-payer system is that it takes the profits out of the system. No one has to make profits. Wall Street cannot threaten insurance companies and private health care companies with being taken over because their profits are too low. No health-provider in a single-payer system has to worry about being displaced in a takeover organized by Wall Street because the profits are too low.\nBecause a single-payer system eliminates the profits that drive up the costs, Wall Street, Insurance companies, and \u201cfree market economists\u201d hate a \u201csocialized\u201d medical care system. They prefer a socialized \u201cprivate\u201d health care system in which public monies flow into private insurance companies.\nTo make the costs as high as possible, conservatives and the private insurance companies devised ObamaCare. The bill was written by conservative think tanks and the private insurance companies. What the \u201csocialistic\u201d ObamaCare bill does is to take income taxes paid by citizens and use the taxes to subsidize the private medical premiums charges by private health care providers in order to provide \u201cprivate\u201d health care to US citizens who cannot afford it.\nThe extremely high costs of ObamaCare is not \u201csocialistic medicine.\u201d ObamaCare is high-cost privatized medicine that guarantees billions of dollars in profits to private insurance companies.\nIt remains to be seen whether such a ridiculous health care scheme, nowhere extant on earth except in Romney\u2019s Massachusetts, will provide health care or just private profits.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nPaul Craig Roberts [paulcraigroberts@yahoo.com] was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury during President Reagan\u2019s first term.

But the good news is his message provides me with the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to, once again, express my strong commitment to his (and church teaching\u2019s) vision for heath care justice, something that has been almost completely lost amid all the noise of opposing Obamacare\u2019s false solutions for achieving this bulwark of the common good.\nThe first thing to realize is that just because the Church is in favor of ensuring that people receive health care does not mean the Church automatically endorses any proposal that walks through the door claiming to do this. In this case, I believe the legislation passed by the Democrats will result in a net detriment to what our dollars earn in terms of health.\nLet\u2019s excerpt some key passages and discuss them:\nIt is necessary to work with greater commitment at all levels so that the right to health is rendered effective, favoring access to primary health care.\nPrimary health care is already available at emergency rooms across the country. Medicaid provides health care coverage to those unable to afford it themselves. Many people of their free will (especially young men) choose not to purchase health care insurance because they don\u2019t believe it to be in their best interest. Now, under Obamacare, everyone is required to register for health insurance or risk a hefty fine. The President\u2019s promise that people will be able to keep their coverage if they like it is already going up in smoke, and the fact that the administration has given out 111+ institutional waivers shows that businesses are finding it difficult to continue offering health care coverage without risking serious financial strain. Are we to believe that Obamacare has really made things better in this regard?\nImportant also in the field of health, integral part of each one\u2019s existence and of the common good, is to establish a true distributive justice that guarantees to all, on the basis of objective needs, adequate care.\nObamacare does not expand care. It expands coverage. Obamacare did not make any new doctors, nurses or hospital equipment. In expanding coverage, many people mistakenly believed that more American citizens now have care. In America we are experiencing a doctor shortage, a nurse shortage and a shortage of actual medical care. In\u00a0Massachusetts\u00a0and other government-sponsored universal health care systems (notably the UK), the fact that everyone has \u201chealthcare\u201d does not help everyone receive care. In fact, rationing and delay-of-care is becoming more and more the norm. Here in the US, Medicare and Medicaid (the government\u2019s major healthcare entitlement programs) are worse offenders than private insurance when it comes to being unable to actually provide care to their subscribers. An expansion of government-care over private-care means more bureaucracy, means more money going to things besides actual care. Again, Obamacare has not made this situation better, it promises to make it worse.\nThe Pope spends a great deal of time condemning pathways to health care justice that fail in providing for human dignity and protection (especially of the unborn). The new funding streams for abortion present in the health care legislation ( see video ), the fact that Planned Parenthood is currently lobbying for contraception to become free to Obamacare subscribers (as a \u201ccost-saving\u201d mechanism), and that the elderly are the greatest financial drain on any\u00a0communitarian\u00a0health system and therefore stand the greatest risk of seeing their benefits curtailed or eliminated are all\u00a0substantial\u00a0proofs for how Obamacare fails to achieve the basic standards for health care coverage and care that the Pope puts forward.\nThere has been a lot of talk about preventive care (a concept that does not appear in the pope\u2019s message). In all the studies of universal\u00a0preventative\u00a0care mandates that I have seen,\u00a0preventative\u00a0care is a net loser for public health. That\u2019s because it costs more to have everyone undergo preventive care than it does to treat people who actually evidence signs of being sick. The idea that having everyone going to regular exams (even if they do not feel sick) and thereby consuming scant medical resources will substitute for the cost of caring for those who are sick does not pass arithmetical muster. I would rather have my doctor caring for those who are sick rather than constantly ensuring that I do not get sick. In a perfect world I would love to pay a doctor to watch over me full time, but I don\u2019t have the money, and there are other people who do need his help, now.\nLooking at the global perspective, as the pope must, it appears to me that he is more concerned over the lack of basic care in poorer countries of the world \u2013 countries that would best be served in the long term medically by becoming more affluent as a society. America, as the government which provides the most overseas aid, is less able to send money outside the country if more of it is being\u00a0misspent\u00a0domestically. In industrialized countries (such as the US), the pope appears more immediately concerned with the perversion of medicine that sees health care as a luxury item as part of a deformed \u201ccult of the body.\u201d If we want to talk about health care injustice, we should be talking about the decadent culture where women pay $20,000 for plastic surgery, as well as the mother of four who is encountering problems in paying for her maternity needs. Health care injustice is not solely rectified by government subsidies of people\u2019s basic health care costs, it is rectified by promoting a culture that views the body properly.\nYou are welcome to read the pope\u2019s message yourself to see if you think I am representing it fairly, and if I am faithfully reflecting on his directives and applying them to the health care legislation enacted by the Democrats.\nLet me conclude with a fundamental point I have stated before. In this entire health care debate, it has come down basically to the difference between people who believe private insurance should be allowed to provide care freely, and those who believe the government ought to establish a system of taxes, mandates and regulatory bureaucracies\u00a0to oversee how this care is provided and paid for. The argument that \u201cthese people are dying\u201d (the number of people who die each year because of a lack of health care is miniscule \u2013 I\u2019ve looked at the studies) and that this is the reason we have to endanger our entire medical system and expose it to more waste and inefficiency for those who are receiving care\u00a0currently\u00a0is far more\u00a0callous, uncharitable,\u00a0and reckless than doing nothing. Presenting the wrong solution doesn\u2019t solve a problem.\nI don\u2019t believe government achieves the goal of providing the best health care to the most number of people better than private insurers. I believe the government is far more prone to abuse, waste and ideology than the private sector, and particularly the Catholic health care network. If Obamacare is not repealed, I believe we can all look forward to an\u00a0impoverished\u00a0offering of health care to more American citizens, and can expect American citizens and the country to become poorer as we pay more for less.\nLiberals should at least acknowledge that the difference between them and conservatives, and orthodox Catholics, is how we achieve health care justice for all, not if this is a worthy goal to pursue in the first place. On that we agree. I submit that the burden of proof still lies with those who believe Obamacare will actually establish health care justice for all. I see little evidence that it will, and plenty of evidence that it won\u2019t. That\u2019s my prudential conclusion, and I am\u00a0saddened\u00a0by my suspicion that in passing Obamacare, America has drifted even further away from the vision of health care justice that the pope presents.\nUPDATE \u2013 while I am thinking about this, let me offer a\u00a0hypothetical\u00a0example that may illuminate the prudential reason why, at the heart, I think government solutions to health care fall short. This is purely for illustrative purposes.\nLet\u2019s say the pope decreed that it is a human right to own a car. Right now, every car costs $2,000. So what if the government passed a law giving a free car to every American? Catholics would have to support such a law, right? Well, what if the law also raised taxes on every American citizen by $3,000. In other words, it\u2019s true \u2013 everyone gets a free car, but it\u2019s also true that the society basically \u201cpaid\u201d for the $2,000 car by having to pay the government $3,000 in taxes.\nIn other words, having a human right to something does not mean that government is the most efficient and just provider of that right, be it cars, or be it our health care.\n"}, {"score": 1264.994, "uuid": "b954a4b3-b0d6-5d46-b5fe-0fa0242b8f40", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1104wb-76-12018", "target_hostname": "catholicvote.org", "target_uri": "http://catholicvote.org/discuss/index.php?p=11710&cpage=2", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "<em>Is</em> the Pope pro-<em>Obamacare</em>? | CatholicVote.org", "snippet": "Are we to believe that <em>Obamacare</em> has <em>really</em> made things <em>better</em> in this regard?

In this entire health care debate, it has come down basically to the difference between people who believe private insurance should be allowed to provide care freely, and those who believe the government ought to establish a system of taxes, mandates and regulatory bureaucracies\u00a0to oversee how this care is provided and paid for. The argument that \u201cthese people are dying\u201d (the number of people who die each year because of a lack of health care is miniscule \u2013 I\u2019ve looked at the studies) and that this is the reason we have to endanger our entire medical system and expose it to more waste and inefficiency for those who are receiving care\u00a0currently\u00a0is far more\u00a0callous, uncharitable,\u00a0and reckless than doing nothing. Presenting the wrong solution doesn\u2019t solve a problem.\nI don\u2019t believe government achieves the goal of providing the best health care to the most number of people better than private insurers. I believe the government is far more prone to abuse, waste and ideology than the private sector, and particularly the Catholic health care network. If Obamacare is not repealed, I believe we can all look forward to an\u00a0impoverished\u00a0offering of health care to more American citizens, and can expect American citizens and the country to become poorer as we pay more for less.\nLiberals should at least acknowledge that the difference between them and conservatives, and orthodox Catholics, is how we achieve health care justice for all, not if this is a worthy goal to pursue in the first place. On that we agree. I submit that the burden of proof still lies with those who believe Obamacare will actually establish health care justice for all. I see little evidence that it will, and plenty of evidence that it won\u2019t. That\u2019s my prudential conclusion, and I am\u00a0saddened\u00a0by my suspicion that in passing Obamacare, America has drifted even further away from the vision of health care justice that the pope presents.\nUPDATE \u2013 while I am thinking about this, let me offer a\u00a0hypothetical\u00a0example that may illuminate the prudential reason why, at the heart, I think government solutions to health care fall short. This is purely for illustrative purposes.\nLet\u2019s say the pope decreed that it is a human right to own a car. Right now, every car costs $2,000. So what if the government passed a law giving a free car to every American? Catholics would have to support such a law, right? Well, what if the law also raised taxes on every American citizen by $3,000. In other words, it\u2019s true \u2013 everyone gets a free car, but it\u2019s also true that the society basically \u201cpaid\u201d for the $2,000 car by having to pay the government $3,000 in taxes.\nIn other words, having a human right to something does not mean that government is the most efficient and just provider of that right, be it cars, or be it our health care.\n"}, {"score": 1259.6821, "uuid": "ec0fcb03-57b4-5ea8-a4eb-a7802807fe1d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1104wb-82-37509", "target_hostname": "catholicvote.org", "target_uri": "http://catholicvote.org/discuss/index.php?p=11710&cpage=3", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "<em>Is</em> the Pope pro-<em>Obamacare</em>? | CatholicVote.org", "snippet": "Are we to believe that <em>Obamacare</em> has <em>really</em> made things <em>better</em> in this regard?

Medicaid provides health care coverage to those unable to afford it themselves. Many people of their free will (especially young men) choose not to purchase health care insurance because they don\u2019t believe it to be in their best interest. Now, under Obamacare, everyone is required to register for health insurance or risk a hefty fine. The President\u2019s promise that people will be able to keep their coverage if they like it is already going up in smoke, and the fact that the administration has given out 111+ institutional waivers shows that businesses are finding it difficult to continue offering health care coverage without risking serious financial strain. Are we to believe that Obamacare has really made things better in this regard?\nImportant also in the field of health, integral part of each one\u2019s existence and of the common good, is to establish a true distributive justice that guarantees to all, on the basis of objective needs, adequate care.\nObamacare does not expand care. It expands coverage. Obamacare did not make any new doctors, nurses or hospital equipment. In expanding coverage, many people mistakenly believed that more American citizens now have care. In America we are experiencing a doctor shortage, a nurse shortage and a shortage of actual medical care. In\u00a0Massachusetts\u00a0and other government-sponsored universal health care systems (notably the UK), the fact that everyone has \u201chealthcare\u201d does not help everyone receive care. In fact, rationing and delay-of-care is becoming more and more the norm. Here in the US, Medicare and Medicaid (the government\u2019s major healthcare entitlement programs) are worse offenders than private insurance when it comes to being unable to actually provide care to their subscribers. An expansion of government-care over private-care means more bureaucracy, means more money going to things besides actual care. Again, Obamacare has not made this situation better, it promises to make it worse.\nThe Pope spends a great deal of time condemning pathways to health care justice that fail in providing for human dignity and protection (especially of the unborn). The new funding streams for abortion present in the health care legislation ( see video ), the fact that Planned Parenthood is currently lobbying for contraception to become free to Obamacare subscribers (as a \u201ccost-saving\u201d mechanism), and that the elderly are the greatest financial drain on any\u00a0communitarian\u00a0health system and therefore stand the greatest risk of seeing their benefits curtailed or eliminated are all\u00a0substantial\u00a0proofs for how Obamacare fails to achieve the basic standards for health care coverage and care that the Pope puts forward.\nThere has been a lot of talk about preventive care (a concept that does not appear in the pope\u2019s message). In all the studies of universal\u00a0preventative\u00a0care mandates that I have seen,\u00a0preventative\u00a0care is a net loser for public health. That\u2019s because it costs more to have everyone undergo preventive care than it does to treat people who actually evidence signs of being sick. The idea that having everyone going to regular exams (even if they do not feel sick) and thereby consuming scant medical resources will substitute for the cost of caring for those who are sick does not pass arithmetical muster. I would rather have my doctor caring for those who are sick rather than constantly ensuring that I do not get sick. In a perfect world I would love to pay a doctor to watch over me full time, but I don\u2019t have the money, and there are other people who do need his help, now.\nLooking at the global perspective, as the pope must, it appears to me that he is more concerned over the lack of basic care in poorer countries of the world \u2013 countries that would best be served in the long term medically by becoming more affluent as a society. America, as the government which provides the most overseas aid, is less able to send money outside the country if more of it is being\u00a0misspent\u00a0domestically.

The president's campaign advisers essentially said, We're going to own that term and spin it as a positive.\nSo they e-mailed their supporters: \"It's about time we give it the love that it deserves. Let everyone know, 'I like Obamacare.'\" And President Obama himself doubled down during a fund-raiser: \"You want to call it Obamacare - that's OK, because I do care.\"\nTeam Obama's bid to own the term (which was coined by conservative critics as a synonym for socialist overreach) is just one facet of its broader plan to trumpet the health reform law as a reelection asset. No matter what the polls say. No matter what the U.S Supreme Court may or may not do.\nThe official Obama campaign video devotes more time to the law than to any other issue. Meanwhile, every day, the administration is highlighting a citizen helped by the law (for instance, a Tampa nurse who got insurance for her son because the law bars insurers from denying coverage to kids with birth defects). And it's peppering swing states with pertinent statistics: \"As of June 2011, 64,798 young adults in Pennsylvania gained insurance coverage as a result of the new health law\" - thanks to the provision that allows parents to cover their kids up to age 26 when the offspring lack coverage of their own.\nThere are three reasons why Obama and his people have opted to own what has long been assumed to be a political albatross: (1) they're confident about their reelection prospects, which have been buoyed by a slowly improving economy; (2) they know that likely challenger Mitt Romney is ill-equipped to bang them on Obamacare, because, as governor, he was the one who championed Obamacare's antecedent; and (3) they frankly had no choice but to embrace the health law and make a virtue out of a necessity. Because if they didn't frame the dialogue their way, the GOP would fill the vacuum.\nOK. By now you may be asking, \"But what about the Supreme Court? If it overturns Obama's signature domestic achievement, particularly the key 'mandate' provision requiring Americans to buy coverage, wouldn't that ruling be a huge political victory for the Republicans?\"\nNot necessarily.\nIf the five Republican appointees strike down the law - ignoring the obvious fact that health care is interstate commerce, and ignoring previous court decisions upholding the regulation of interstate commerce, even the amount of wheat farmers can grow for personal use - two things will happen in the political realm:\nThe Republicans would lose the rhetorical weapon they have wielded since the summer of 2009. Politicians like Rick Santorum will no longer be able to summon the conservative base with war cries about \"the death knell of freedom.\" And GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill, no longer able to demand that health reform be \"repealed and replaced,\" would be under pressure to actually tackle the challenge of covering the uninsured and fixing the abiding inequities of the Western world's most dysfunctional health system. (Which, for decades, they generally have been loathe to do.)\nIn other words, \"Be careful what you wish for.\"\nMeanwhile, if the high court says no to health reform, Democrats would gain a powerful rhetorical weapon, one that would help them energize the liberal base. And they'd say to swing voters: \"Obama gave you a historic reform law that barred insurers from capping your health coverage, that barred insurers from denying coverage to kids with preexisting conditions, that kept adult kids on the family coverage, and that gave financial help to many seniors who get the Medicare prescription drug benefit. But now this law has been taken away from you.\"\nThe motivated voter is often an angry voter. And nothing makes a voter angrier than losing something that betters daily life.\nWomen, in particular, are sensitive about the health issue. Between the ages of 30 and 55, they're usually the prime caregivers for children and parents; in the recent words of Republican pollster Bill McInturff, \"they're more engaged and active in the health care system\" than the other gender. And they'd lose a lot if the health-reform law goes away - including the provision that bars insurers from dropping women when they get pregnant, the provision that bars insurers from charging them higher premiums than men, and the provision that requires insurers to cover mammograms and contraception without charging co-payments.\nWomen voters would be open to the Democratic argument, if only because they're heavily tilting to the Democrats already. The newly-released poll conducted by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center shows Obama topping Romney among women by a whopping 20 percentage points (and among all voters by 12) - a gender gap that even dwarfs Obama's hefty '08 advantage over John McCain. And, remember, women traditionally vote more heavily than men in presidential years; last time, they were 53 percent of the electorate.\nRomney is losing women for a number of reasons - in his defense, he's probably taking collateral damage for the GOP's state-by-state efforts to enact laws meddling in women's private lives - but this shorthand is surely a contributing factor: Obama favors health reform, while Romney keeps vowing \"on day one\" to repeal it \"root and branch.\" This, despite his own track record of signing similar health-reform legislation in Massachusetts.\nImagine what might happen this autumn. Assume, for the moment, that the high court upholds health reform (still a possibility). The GOP would still have its issue, and Romney would vow anew to repeal the law - whereupon Obama would seize the opening, and paint Romney as a guy whose convictions are as ephemeral as an Etch a Sketch image.\nObama would point out that Romneycare was the template for Obamacare. And what fun it would be, at the debates, if Obama quoted the old Romney, the gubernatorial guy who said that the health-coverage mandate is \"a Republican way of reforming the market.\" What better way for Obama to convince women of Romney's hypocrisy - and depress conservative turnout in November?\nSo no wonder Obama wants to own Obamacare. He has ample messaging options. Regardless of whether the health law is dead or alive this fall, his political pulse seems strong.\nContact Dick Polman at dickpolman7@gmail.com or follow @dickpolman1 on Twitter.\n"}, {"score": 1255.6149, "uuid": "05473723-7454-563b-93a0-30e8cf55699d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-10-08184", "target_hostname": "www.philly.com", "target_uri": "http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/dick_polman/20120401_Embracing_Obamacare.html", "page_rank": 1.1770817e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Embracing <em>Obamacare</em>", "snippet": "The official Obama campaign video devotes more time to the law <em>than</em> to <em>any</em> other issue.", "explanation": null, "document": "Posted: Sun, Apr. 1, 2012, 3:00 AM\nEmbracing Obamacare\nDick Polman, Inquirer National Political Columnist\nPAUL LACHINE / newsart.com\nChat with Dick Polman on 2012 campaign\nAn amazing moment occurred the other day on the two-year anniversary of the health-reform law that has long been burdened by the pejorative term Obamacare.

No matter what the polls say. No matter what the U.S Supreme Court may or may not do.\nThe official Obama campaign video devotes more time to the law than to any other issue. Meanwhile, every day, the administration is highlighting a citizen helped by the law (for instance, a Tampa nurse who got insurance for her son because the law bars insurers from denying coverage to kids with birth defects). And it's peppering swing states with pertinent statistics: \"As of June 2011, 64,798 young adults in Pennsylvania gained insurance coverage as a result of the new health law\" - thanks to the provision that allows parents to cover their kids up to age 26 when the offspring lack coverage of their own.\nThere are three reasons why Obama and his people have opted to own what has long been assumed to be a political albatross: (1) they're confident about their reelection prospects, which have been buoyed by a slowly improving economy; (2) they know that likely challenger Mitt Romney is ill-equipped to bang them on Obamacare, because, as governor, he was the one who championed Obamacare's antecedent; and (3) they frankly had no choice but to embrace the health law and make a virtue out of a necessity. Because if they didn't frame the dialogue their way, the GOP would fill the vacuum.\nOK. By now you may be asking, \"But what about the Supreme Court? If it overturns Obama's signature domestic achievement, particularly the key 'mandate' provision requiring Americans to buy coverage, wouldn't that ruling be a huge political victory for the Republicans?\"\nNot necessarily.\nIf the five Republican appointees strike down the law - ignoring the obvious fact that health care is interstate commerce, and ignoring previous court decisions upholding the regulation of interstate commerce, even the amount of wheat farmers can grow for personal use - two things will happen in the political realm:\nThe Republicans would lose the rhetorical weapon they have wielded since the summer of 2009. Politicians like Rick Santorum will no longer be able to summon the conservative base with war cries about \"the death knell of freedom.\" And GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill, no longer able to demand that health reform be \"repealed and replaced,\" would be under pressure to actually tackle the challenge of covering the uninsured and fixing the abiding inequities of the Western world's most dysfunctional health system. (Which, for decades, they generally have been loathe to do.)\nIn other words, \"Be careful what you wish for.\"\nMeanwhile, if the high court says no to health reform, Democrats would gain a powerful rhetorical weapon, one that would help them energize the liberal base. And they'd say to swing voters: \"Obama gave you a historic reform law that barred insurers from capping your health coverage, that barred insurers from denying coverage to kids with preexisting conditions, that kept adult kids on the family coverage, and that gave financial help to many seniors who get the Medicare prescription drug benefit. But now this law has been taken away from you.\"\nThe motivated voter is often an angry voter. And nothing makes a voter angrier than losing something that betters daily life.\nWomen, in particular, are sensitive about the health issue. Between the ages of 30 and 55, they're usually the prime caregivers for children and parents; in the recent words of Republican pollster Bill McInturff, \"they're more engaged and active in the health care system\" than the other gender. And they'd lose a lot if the health-reform law goes away - including the provision that bars insurers from dropping women when they get pregnant, the provision that bars insurers from charging them higher premiums than men, and the provision that requires insurers to cover mammograms and contraception without charging co-payments.\nWomen voters would be open to the Democratic argument, if only because they're heavily tilting to the Democrats already. The newly-released poll conducted by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center shows Obama topping Romney among women by a whopping 20 percentage points (and among all voters by 12) - a gender gap that even dwarfs Obama's hefty '08 advantage over John McCain. And, remember, women traditionally vote more heavily than men in presidential years; last time, they were 53 percent of the electorate.\nRomney is losing women for a number of reasons - in his defense, he's probably taking collateral damage for the GOP's state-by-state efforts to enact laws meddling in women's private lives - but this shorthand is surely a contributing factor: Obama favors health reform, while Romney keeps vowing \"on day one\" to repeal it \"root and branch.\" This, despite his own track record of signing similar health-reform legislation in Massachusetts.\nImagine what might happen this autumn. Assume, for the moment, that the high court upholds health reform (still a possibility). The GOP would still have its issue, and Romney would vow anew to repeal the law - whereupon Obama would seize the opening, and paint Romney as a guy whose convictions are as ephemeral as an Etch a Sketch image.\nObama would point out that Romneycare was the template for Obamacare. And what fun it would be, at the debates, if Obama quoted the old Romney, the gubernatorial guy who said that the health-coverage mandate is \"a Republican way of reforming the market.\" What better way for Obama to convince women of Romney's hypocrisy - and depress conservative turnout in November?\nSo no wonder Obama wants to own Obamacare. He has ample messaging options. Regardless of whether the health law is dead or alive this fall, his political pulse seems strong.\nContact Dick Polman at dickpolman7@gmail.com or follow @dickpolman1 on Twitter.\n"}, {"score": 1259.7493, "uuid": "ac9a6d53-827f-5dcd-9b42-9a6c0eb80323", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400tw-32-17572", "target_hostname": "blogs.babycenter.com", "target_uri": "http://blogs.babycenter.com/mom_stories/040912obamacare-is-your-doctor-on-board/", "page_rank": 1.1802017e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "<em>Obamacare</em> \u2013 <em>Is</em> your doctor on board? | BabyCenter", "snippet": "He tells me how the NHS there <em>is</em> no incentive to provide good care and be efficient.

Let me repeat that \u2013 ANYBODY! I don\u2019t have to see someone on my insurance co\u2019s list of providers, or pay extra if I see someone not on their list.\nIt would also free me up to look for another job becasue of my pre-existing condition.\nAnd while your looking for doctor\u2019s opinions, try asking them about dealing with insurance companies!\nSara\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 9:30 am\nOkay.. so if you aren\u2019t for this reform.. what are you for? Leaving it as is? Obviously something needs done. No one is offering up any other options.. just trying to veto this. I don\u2019t have all the answers, and I don\u2019t know all the details of everything insurance related. All I know is America is in trouble health insurance-wise.. if people are going to stop this bill, what are the options they are offering up? We need affordable health care, so what is going to happen?\nI\u2019m still all about universal healthcare and will continue to be. I\u2019m with LilRhody. My brother had the same experience living overseas, covered in their national insurance. I know many others who know this to be true too.\nSara\nApril 9, 2012 at 9:37 am\nAh, I didn\u2019t read your last two paragraphs. What about pre-existing conditions?\nI don\u2019t hear too much talk or progress on anything being done other then to veto Obama\u2019s bill.\njulius\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 9:39 am\nThe reason why health care costs are so high here is because so many people don\u2019t pay for their health care or the socialized medicine we do have Medicaid and Medicare do not pay enough so doctor\u2019s pass on the additional costs to private insurance companies.\nIt is kind of like companies having some products that don\u2019t make any money, but making it up in other products or customers.\nLast I read, hospitals expect to receive about 60% of what is actually charged, and that is just hospitals. Some pay nothing and some pay a whole lot.\nAs for pre-existing conditions: This law makes it possible for anyone healthy to just pay $750/year and then when they get really sick they can pay for a policy that will likely not cover the cost of their care. It will cause prices of insurance to shoot way up.\nSo we\u2019ll end up with universal health care, which is what Obama had told the SEIU in 2007 was what he really wanted, but that it would take some years to get there. We will get there.\nI have a colleague in Great Britain and he carries private insurance. He tells me how the NHS there is no incentive to provide good care and be efficient. Their pay is the same no matter what. While NHS has cut back on benefits due to budget issues, they have not laid off any staff. The employees are better protected than the patients this group is meant to serve.\nHe (my colleague) told me that if he were ever in an accident he would first be sent to an NHS hospital, and if he was lucky enough to survive that they would send him to a private hospital.\nI read an article about a lady in Great Britain that had to clean her own hospital roome because it was so filthy.\nAlso, US is much larger and more diverse, geographically, culturally, ethnically than most European countries.\nWhen has the government ever responded to complaints of poor service? If you don\u2019t have an answer than how do you expect the government to respond when they fail to meet their obligation to provide for your care.\nFlorexas\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 9:44 am\nI don\u2019t see why this is all or nothing. Do I believe the insurance (not healthcare itself) needs changing, ie covering pre-exixsting conditions. Absoulutly. Do I believe the Govt can force me to purchase something simply because I am alive, Absoultly NOT!!! The Govt doesn\u2019t know how to run anything sucessfully. Look at the Postal service, medicare, medicaid, Social Security, they are all broke. If the Govt had a good track record of taking something over and making it successful, I might be for it. But as it stands now, I think it should have been an overhaul of the current insurance system. Don\u2019t think the Govt doesn\u2019t have access to your electronic medical records, they do. And once they are paying for your health bills, it won\u2019t be long before they start enforcing medical decisions that should be between you and your doctor. What\u2019s to stop them from saying you are smoker, we aren\u2019t covering care for lung cancer. Woman, you have more than 3 children, prenatal care and delivery won\u2019t be covered for you, becuase your family is a drain on the system. Or what if you have a special needs child or one that is very sick, and want to have more kids, you think they will let you. You are high risk of having more kids that will drain the system. DO NOT GIVE THE GOVT ANY POWER YOU DON\u2019T WANT YOUR WORST ENEMY TO HAVE. If they can force to buy health insurance becuse its for your own good, what prevents them in 50 years from forcing people to buy guns to protect themselves for their own good. You have set the precedent for the govt to tell you how to spend your money, which is therefore your time. You spend time at work, and someone pays you for that time. Don\u2019t think its not coming, you think 100 years ago our great grand parents would have thought the Govt will be supporting people and paying for their doctor visits. Things happen faster than you think.\nAnd as far as pre-existing conditions, as long as you are currently covered, you can look for a new job. You just can\u2019t have a lapse in coverage. If your conidtion was covered previously, and there is no lapse in it, then your new insurance has to cover it too.\nLynn\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 10:16 am\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why this is all or nothing. Do I believe the insurance (not healthcare itself) needs changing, ie covering pre-exixsting conditions. Absoulutly. Do I believe the Govt can force me to purchase something simply because I am alive, Absoultly NOT!!!\u201d\nThis is not sarcastic questions, so please treat them accordingly.\nHow can we tell an insurance company they cannot deny coverage of pre-existing conditions without requiring people to pay into the system before they have a pre-existing condition? What\u2019s to stop me from not paying into the insurance pool for all of my healthy years and then suddenly expect insurance to cover high blood pressure or diabetes or a hip replacement or whatever else might happen in the future?\nBeth\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 10:19 am\nMy problem with the current legislation is that there were too many concessions. The elements that were scrapped for being \u201ctoo socialist\u201d only benefit the insurance companies.\nComing from someone who has had to buy private insurance for most of my adult life, I strongly support socialized medicine ala the UK. I would like to see all employer group policies (including Tricare and whatever government employees have) canceled with little to no notice. Go scramble to find insurance yourself. Learn that paying only $500 to $1000 a month for premiums on a high deductible policy is a good deal and THEN lets talk about health care in America.\nBeth\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 10:27 am\n\u201cAnd as far as pre-existing conditions, as long as you are currently covered, you can look for a new job. You just can\u2019t have a lapse in coverage. If your conidtion was covered previously, and there is no lapse in it, then your new insurance has to cover it too.\u201d\nThis is why I think employer coverage needs to go away for people to understand. Many many many people don\u2019t have the option of jumping from one group policy to the next where pre-existing conditions are a non-issue providing there is no lapse in coverage. They have to go buy their own insurance and preexisting conditions are a HUGE deal.\nAnd as for the government refusing to cover maternity after 3 kids, try being in the private insurance market where they won\u2019t cover your first kid.\nPeople who are comfortable with their employer provided group coverage don\u2019t get it. They don\u2019t get how you can spend the equivalent of a mortgage payment every month on premiums and then still spend thousands on a deductible that only gets you 20% coverage so if something truly catastrophic happens, you\u2019re still going to declare bankruptcy.\nKatie\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 11:08 am\nI\u2019ve always been confused by the argument that this is government healthcare \u2013 the affordable care act isn\u2019t government run healthcare. The government isn\u2019t suddenly gong to be insuring us all. You\u2019re just required to buy insurance (your choice!) and the insurance companies are required to follow certain rules, such as pre-existing conditions, etc. Medicare/medicaid are much closer to government run healthcare/ governemnt making decisions about what healthcare you will recieve than what the affordable care act proposes, and we already have those with widespread support from the public.\nSo I think it\u2019s a good idea. Even julius acknowledged one of the high costs in healthcare is that some people aren\u2019t paying for it. If we eliminate the uninsured so everyone is at least paying something that should help at least a little bit with the cost.\nAs for the argument about healthcare costs in MA going up, that\u2019s a useless fact unless we know how much they went up in other states during the same time period for comparison (faster increase in other states? slower increase in other states?). Also, massachusetts insurance is a bit screwy anyway. THeir auto insurance is highly regulated and as a result many companies don\u2019t offer insurance in the state, so I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the best comparison.\nI think doctors are just as fed up with dealing with insurance as anything else, so I\u2019m not sure affordable care act will make any difference in that!\nChristine\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 12:56 pm\nI manage a doctor\u2019s office and I see first hand what is being described in the doctor surveys. I am hoping Obamacare is repealed and, yes, it WILL affect how I vote in the election.\nChristine\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 12:58 pm\nI am an office manager at a doctor\u2019s office and I see first hand what is being described in the doctor surveys.

He had ulcerative colitis but didn\u2019t have any medical insurance because his company didn\u2019t offer any and he didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid. Even if his company offered it I probably wouldn\u2019t qualify due to having a pre-exisiting condition. His ulcerative colitis flaired up really bad and he started to take a lot of OTC drugs to control the pain. He took too many and it caused liver damage. He died a very painful death. It upsets me to know that my daughter will never know her Uncle. It disgusts me that so many people are against a program that can provide affordable healthcare to those who do not have it.\nJenny\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 1:27 pm\nThe doctors confirm my fears about where out health system is going. Another poster asked us to look at how the government is fairing in other areas. The answer is not very well. I do not want a bureaucratic monstrosity in charge of health care.\nbearfencemtn\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 1:42 pm\nOk, I have lived in Costa Rica and in Peru. Both have socialized medicine but at different levels. Everyone pays into the public option in Costa Rica, but the public option does not really involve insurance. It is like a public clinic and prescriptions are free. If you don\u2019t want the public option (because there is more of a wait), then you are free to choose any private clinic that you want. The prices of the private clinics are less than they are here because they have competition from the public option.\nSame in Peru, but there is not as much public support. You can go to a public hosptital and wait and not get as good care, or you can go to a private clinic. The private clinics have to be affordable because there is a public option to compete with.\nYou can save money by waiting at the public clinic for routine things. There is also more patient control in these systems.\nThese systems are not based on insurance (like socialized care in Europe is which seems to be running out of money) but a free market system where costs are kept down.\nNow I am not saying that this is THE solution, but it seems to be better than care centered around insurance companies. For example I paid $30 for an ultrasound in Peru at a private clinic when I know the hospital charges about $1000 for an ultrasound in the states and the difference in income between Peru and the US is not 3 to 100.\nWe have two problems with healthcare that need to be solved: tort reform and price control. Price control is going to be impossible if it does not hurt to abuse the system. I taught in the public school system and I know that people don\u2019t care to learn when they see their parents living off of someone else (their grandma, the government) for free. People are not going to take care of their health if it does not hurt them. Yes, you have the right to do what you want to your body, but I should not have to pay to cure what you decide to break. Does this seem cruel, maybe not if you consider the fact group health insurance is already telling us how to run our lives so that premiums remain low. Socialized medicine seems likely to do the same.\nFaith\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 2:28 pm\nWhat Beth said. We\u2019re part of that unlucky group that makes too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private health insurance for all three of us. Right now my son and I are covered by group insurance, but we may have to buy private insurance in the near future. It\u2019s pretty sobering to see that if I had an unplanned pregnancy, I\u2019d be SOL, since no private health plan covers prenatal care. Needless to say, 2014 won\u2019t come soon enough.\njulius\nApril 9, 2012 at 3:09 pm\nGee Katie \u201ceven Julius. . .\u201d Not sure what I should think of that.\n.\nOne thing that sort of bugs me when people talk about socialized medicine in other countries is that #1 our country is much bigger and much more divers so it will be much harder and much more corrtuption, but #2 more subtly, I wonder how much people with socialized medicine know about other available treatments. If the government isn\u2019t going to pay for a therapy, why would a doctor even introduce the option to the patient. We have sort of a free market in place here, and so we learn about other options that may be more expensive, but it should be up to us to decide what we are willing to pay for, not the government.\nComment#22 bearfencemtn. had some ideas that even my greedy, money grubbing conservative mind might could get behind, possibly.\nKatie\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 4:02 pm\nMy dad\u2019s a surgeon. He\u2019s strongly for a single payer system. Go practice medicine in a rural low income area for 30 years and you may just agree with him. His main complaint with the health insurance reform (I hate the term \u201cObamacare\u201d) is that it didn\u2019t do enough. And for full disclosure, he was a staunch Republican for many many years\u2026and was a big fundraiser for the party until health care made him leave the party.\nAnyway, I suspect most of what the survey shows is that most doctors are wealthy and most wealthy people vote Republican. Pretty much what I expected.\nKatie\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 5:36 pm\nI took this at face value, but i had to look up the survey companies bc those statistics felt wrong. The Doctor Survey Company is according to their website \u201cThe nations largest medical malpractice insurer\u201d. The other survey \u2013 Deloitte Center for Health Solutions is owned by Deloitte \u2013 sorry not trusting a for-profit company whose goal is to make money off of health care.\nThis is why politics is so darn frustrating. Trying to find the truth is impossible these days.\njulius\nApril 9, 2012 at 6:11 pm\nKatie: You comment here isn\u2019t right.\nAnyway, I suspect most of what the survey shows is that most doctors are wealthy and most wealthy people vote Republican.

This is disservice to both the GOP and uninformed voters.\nAs for your father, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll find the cure he is looking for in Obamacare. Does he have experience practicing medicine under single payer system to compare?\njulius\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 6:14 pm\nOne more point. I understand that many people are not interested in hearing the opinons of for profit companies, because they expect greed to be involved.\nDo you think that it is not possible for there to be greed in government? How do politicians get so rich, while serving in office?\nDo you know where the richest counties are in the country? Right outside of DC? Why is that do you suppose??\nI remember reading somewhere that the number of federally owned limosuines increased 71% in 2009. In relative terms, it is small potatoes, but the symbolism is disturbing.\nPoliticans throughout the ages have been known for greed and graft (even in Biblical times). I don\u2019t know what makes it different today.\nSandi\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 7:35 pm\nugh Obamacare makes me sick to think of it. We are from Israel, we have an intimate history with socialized medicine. There is a very very important reason why Obama waited until AFTER reelection for Obamacare to kick in. Get ready to enjoy this America. It\u2019s going to suck.\nOh, just wanted to add, Obama sort of makes me sick too. Definitely love his plan to make it illegal to aid babies born ALIVE who have survived abortion attempts. Awesome. That law makes me feel like a really good person. gross.\nAly\nsays:\nApril 9, 2012 at 10:29 pm\nDid anyone notice that the highest percentages are related to questions of how the affordable care act will negatively affect what physicians get paid?\nAs to the comments about how hospitals \u201conly get paid 60 cents on the dollar of what they charge\u201d there is a simple reason. Hospitals know what Medicare and Medicaid will pay, and what insurance companies will pay. The itemized bills they send mean NOTHING to insurers. Insurers pay the same price for the same condition whether you stay a day or a week, whether you receive one pill or twenty. They also know that a certain percentage of patients won\u2019t pay a penny of their bill. So the numbers on the bill reflect a \u201cpipe dream\u201d price, that about 1% of people who get treated at a hospital actually pay. So when you hear about the $3 tylenol that costs the hospital 3 cents, it is billed that way because Medicare and Medicaid pay them 2 cents for it (and that\u2019s about 75% of the hospital\u2019s patients), private insurers pay them 3.1 cents for it, and the charity cases pay them zero cents for it. So the poor sucker with no insurance but who has other assets gets charged $3 so the hospital can make money off of somebody, and offset the money they lose on the medicare, medicaid, and no-pay patients. They can print any price they want on that bill because no one pays it, and then they cry poverty because \u201cthey don\u2019t get reimbursed as much as they are billing for.\u201d But look around. When you see a hospital that isn\u2019t building a new wing or building, isn\u2019t renovating and upgrading, that\u2019s how you know they are actually losing money like they say they are.\nI have worked in hospitals for years and am well aware that this is the reality of health care administration.\nkeithmullin\nsays:\nApril 10, 2012 at 3:36 am\nStarting this year your child (or children) cannot be denied coverage simply because they have a pre-existing health condition. If you don\u2019t have insurance for you and your children search \u201cPenny Health\u201d online they are the best.\njulius\nsays:\nApril 10, 2012 at 5:55 am\nAly: Shouldn\u2019t doctor\u2019t get some kind of benefit for spending most of their 20s in intense educational programs making next to nothing and taking out massive loans? Time is something too, and you never get to relive those years, no matter how much you earn later on.\nAs for the way hospital\u2019s bill, I have heard of people talking to hospitals and saying they will self pay and getting a lower rate. It happens. That would be ideal. Hospital\u2019s wouldn\u2019t have to charge so much if they knew they were getting paid. I agree that people that self-pay shouldn\u2019t be stuck with paying the higher rate, and would support any initiative that made it easier for people to have more say in how much their health care costs. Filtering every doctor payment through an insurance company is wasteful and unnecessary.\nLeave a Reply\n"}], [{"score": 1250.2802, "uuid": "c5fdbdb5-27d2-5f61-ac5d-507aa2802a15", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400tw-12-12974", "target_hostname": "www.chicagotribune.com", "target_uri": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/obama/ct-oped-0405-goldberg-20120405,0,1686628.column", "page_rank": 1.1752764e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>Obamacare</em> <em>is</em> Romney&#x27;s best weapon - chicagotribune.com", "snippet": "All the voters <em>really</em> need to know <em>is</em> that Romney <em>is</em> against <em>Obamacare</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Comments\n2\nOpponents of President Barack Obama's health care legislation rally in Washington as the Supreme Court heard arguments on the act's constitutionality last month.

You promised it would be me!\" And while Rick Santorum clearly thinks he still has a chance, his dyspeptic personality often makes it seem that, like a character out of \"Seinfeld,\" he's staying in the race out of spite.\nRelated\nMadigan: Playing the health care card\nBut Santorum says otherwise, and one of his core arguments is that the author of \"Romneycare\" \u2014 the Massachusetts health care reform that was a precursor of sorts to Obamacare, at least according to Barack Obama and his supporters \u2014 is unfit to take on the president in the general election.\n\"Frankly, I think he will be destroyed by President Obama on this issue come the fall,\" Santorum told CNN's John King recently. \"And it should be the biggest issue that helps us win this election. It will be turned into a negative under Mitt Romney.\" Indeed, throughout the debate season, Santorum and others constantly insisted that Romney can't attack Obamacare.\nThe funny thing is: Even as they were saying he can't attack Obamacare, Romney was \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 attacking Obamacare. Romney has been attacking Obamacare since its inception. \"I'll stop it in its tracks on day one!\" he promises constantly on the stump.\nThroughout this primary season, the urge to sound like pundits has been strong with some of the candidates, particularly Santorum and Gingrich \u2014 probably because they were pundits before they got into the race. As a result, they've imported a style of argumentation better suited for high school debate class. Yes, Romney might be inconsistent to attack Obamacare, at least on the mandate, but there's no basis in reality to say he \"can't\" attack it nonetheless.\nObama opposed the mandate vociferously when running against Hillary Clinton , but that didn't stop him from fighting to make it the law of the land.\nMoreover, the broader bipartisan assumption that Romney will be hurt by Romneycare in the general election is deeply flawed.\nFirst of all, Obamacare is unpopular (a fact a lot of political coverage conveniently overlooks). That's why Democrats don't talk about it on the stump, and neither did Obama for a very long time \u2014 until the Supreme Court forced him to re-acquire political ownership. If the court upholds the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obama is not going to want to remind voters of his responsibility for an unpopular piece of legislation. If the court throws it out, Obama is not going to want to remind voters that his signature accomplishment \u2014 which distracted him from a bad economy and cost the Democrats the House \u2014 was so flawed that the court had to reject it. Either way, Obama will not be racing to talk about health care. But Romney will.\nIt's often said that Obama will respond to Romney's attacks by saying the mandate was based on Romneycare. Romney will respond, \"Well, you did it wrong\" and promise to repeal and replace the law. All the voters really need to know is that Romney is against Obamacare. Besides, Romney will have plenty of other lines of attack: the raid on Medicare, the rationing board, the tax hikes, the religious liberty issues, the creation of a vast new entitlement when the existing ones are crushing us with debt, etc.\nCore Republican voters will vote against Obama, not for Romney. Polls show GOPers are more enthusiastic about voting in 2012 than Democrats. Meanwhile, the independents and moderates who dislike Obamacare, but who are not libertarians, will most likely see Romneycare as evidence that Romney is not one of the right-wing crazies the \"Today\" show keeps warning them about.\nDemocrats are truly comfortable only attacking Republicans as \"extremists\" of one flavor or another. But over the weekend Joe Biden tried attacking Romney for being too \"flexible.\" That might have bite coming from the right in the primaries, but it looks as if the primaries are over.\nTribune Media Services\nJonah Goldberg is an editor-at-large of National Review Online and a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n"}, {"score": 1249.9636, "uuid": "0368a5a2-00f5-57ed-86d3-ad5d2c44da15", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0612wb-80-10504", "target_hostname": "cfif.org", "target_uri": "http://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/56/1321-whats-really-at-stake-with-obamacare-legal-battle", "page_rank": 1.3612724e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "What\u2019s <em>Really</em> at Stake With <em>ObamaCare</em> Legal Battle", "snippet": "For the government to be able to require that its citizens buy a particular product <em>is</em> for it to have power in the economic realm that <em>is</em> effectively unlimited \u2013 and that has never been exercised before.

The Constitution grants the federal government about thirty-five specific powers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c eighteen in Article I, Section 8, and the rest scattered throughout the document.\u00c2\u00a0 (The exact number depends on how you count.)\u00c2\u00a0 None of those powers seems to authorize control of the health care system outside the District of Columbia and the federal territories.\nTo be sure, since the late 1930s, the Supreme Court has been tolerant of the federal welfare state, usually justifying federal ad hoc programs under specious interpretations of the congressional Commerce Power.\u00c2\u00a0 But, except in wartime, the Court has never authorized an expansion of the federal scope quite as large as what is being proposed now.\u00c2\u00a0 And in recent years, both the Court and individual justices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liberal\u00e2\u20ac\u009d justices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have said repeatedly that there are boundaries beyond which Congress may not go.\nThe greatest Chief Justice, John Marshall, once wrote that if Congress were to use its legitimate powers as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretext\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for assuming an unauthorized power, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it would become the painful duty\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of the Court \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to say that such an act was not the law of the land.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nBut health care bills such as the Obama-favored HB 3200 do not even offer a pretext.\u00c2\u00a0 The only reference to the Constitution in HB 3200 is a severability clause that purports to save the remainder of the bill if part is declared unconstitutional.\u00c2\u00a0 HB 3200 contains no reference to the Commerce Power or to any other enumerated power.\nExcessive Delegation. The Constitution \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vests\u00e2\u20ac\u009d legislative authority\u00c2\u00a0 in Congress.\u00c2\u00a0 Congress is not permitted to delegate that authority to the executive branch.\u00c2\u00a0 This is another realm in which the modern Supreme Court has been lenient, while affirming that there are limits.\nThus, in Schecter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935), a unanimous court struck down a delegation of authority that looked much like the delegations in some current health care proposals.\nSubstantive Due Process. The Substantive Due Process doctrine was not contemplated by the Founders, but the courts have engrafted onto constitutional jurisprudence.\u00c2\u00a0 The courts employ this doctrine to invalidate laws they think are unacceptably intrusive of personal liberty or privacy.\nThe most famous modern Substantive Due Process case is Roe v. Wade, which struck down state abortion laws that intruded into the doctor-patient relationship.\u00c2\u00a0 But the intrusion invalidated in Roe was insignificant compared to the massive intervention contemplated by schemes such as HB 3200.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global budgeting\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153single-payer\u00e2\u20ac\u009d plans go even further, and seem clearly to violate the Supreme Court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Substantive Due Process rules.\nTenth Amendment. Technically, the Tenth Amendment is merely a declaration that the federal government has no powers beyond those enumerated in the Constitution.\u00c2\u00a0 However, the modern Supreme Court has cited the Tenth Amendment in holding that Congress may not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153commandeer\u00e2\u20ac\u009d state decision making in the service of federal goals.\nIt is permissible for Congress to condition grants of funds to the states, if the conditions are related to the funding program and are not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coercive.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Thus, in 1986 the Court ruled that Congress may, because of highway safety issues, reduce highway grants by five percent to states refusing to raise their drinking ages to 21.\nBut the mandates that some health care plans would impose on states certainly could be found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coercive,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d both because they are excessive (HB 3200, for instance, would withdraw all Public Health Service Act money from non-cooperating states) and because they are unrelated to the program.\nA major goal of our Constitution and Bill of Rights is to limit government power, especially federal power.\u00c2\u00a0 National health care proposals would increase that power greatly, so it is not surprising that those proposals have constitutional difficulties.\nWhatever the merits of federal control of health care, moving in that direction is (as former Justice David Souter might say) a change of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constitutional dimension.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 The proper way to make such a change is not through an ordinary congressional bill.\u00c2\u00a0 The proper way is by constitutional amendment.\nRob Natelson is Professor of Law at The University of Montana, and a leading constitutional scholar.\u00c2\u00a0 (See www.umt.edu/law/faculty/natelson.htm .)

Each asked tough questions.\u00a0 Justice Kennedy appears to want to find it unconstitutional, but wants to think more, which is good.\u00a0 Justice Breyer appears to be the opposite, but struggling.\u00a0 He suggested Congress has the power to compel the purchase of cell phones and similar items.\u00a0 I have doubts he was serious.\u00a0 I suspect he was attempting to provoke a response from the Solicitor General.\u00a0 Throughout both days, Justice Breyer questioned both sides very well and appeared reachable.\nJustice Sotomayor, for the most part, appears (as one would expect) to support constitutionality; however, she also appears open.\u00a0 I doubt she will vote for unconstitutional, but it is not unthinkable.\u00a0 Justice Kagan is, I believe, probably lost, which is no surprise.\u00a0 I feel better today about Justice Ginsberg, but I wish someone would have answered her questions on Social Security.\u00a0 Let me do so.\nJustice Ginsberg, Social Security and Medicare are very different from the ACA.\u00a0 SS and Medicare are constitutional income taxes on people who choose to earn wages or who self-employ.\u00a0 They are also constitutional excises on employers.\u00a0 As an entirely separate matter, both involve Congress\u2019 spending power, which it annually uses to pay money for the general welfare for old age, survivor\u2019s, disability, and health care benefits.\u00a0 Congress could constitutionally repeal all the benefits tomorrow and keep the taxes, both past and future.\u00a0 The two are entirely separate.\u00a0 Thus neither Social Security nor Medicare is an insurance program.\u00a0 In contrast, the ACA compels people to purchase real health insurance from a real private party.\u00a0 It then directly taxes people who have no insurance, but does so in a manner which is not apportioned.\u00a0 Both aspects are unconstitutional.\u00a0 The first compels commerce, which violates the commerce clause.\u00a0 The second is an impermissible unapportioned direct tax and thus violated the Taxing Power.\u00a0 For Social Security and Medicare, the notion that the two halves (the tax and the benefits) are connected is a myth.\u00a0 They are not.\u00a0 Indeed, each is constitutional separately under different powers.\u00a0 For the ACA, the two are connected and each is unconstitutional \u2013 both together and separately.\u00a0 In sum, the ACA is about the health insurance market.\u00a0 Neither social security nor medicare have anything to do with insurance: that they do is a myth . . . and a fraud \u2013 a sometimes difficult-to-understand myth, but a myth nevertheless.\nI doubt anyone will reach Justice Ginsberg, either in argument, in brief, or in discussion on the Court.\u00a0 I doubt anyone will convince Justice Kagan, either.\u00a0 I thus predict the vote will be 5-4 or 6-3 unconstitutional, with a remote chance of 7-2 unconstitutional.\u00a0 I predict it will be on commerce clause grounds, but with at least a concurring opinion on the Taxing Power.\nI take some pride in believing my co-author and I destroyed the taxing power argument so thoroughly (in four articles and four briefs), the government relegated it to a minute or so.\u00a0 They gave up because they could not defend it.\u00a0 I wish the opponents had seized upon that opening and hammered the Taxing\u00a0 Power argument, but they did not.\u00a0 Had they done so, I would be predicting better odds.

In short, they engineered a lie, and that lie was that over ten years, the costs of Obama-care would be \u201cjust\u201d $900 Billion, but now the CBO has revised its estimates, and that number has sky-rocketed to nearly $1.8 Trillion .\u00a0 You might wonder how badly you\u2019re about to be hammered, but you can expect that by the time Obamacare is fully implemented, most working Americans will see their premiums sky-rocket(and in truth, many already have in just the last two years since the bill\u2019s passage.)\u00a0 Expect to pay more in taxes, and if you\u2019re an employer, you may want to consider what they intend for you with all the new penalties.\nBack in 2009-10, when the bill was being debated, they kept going back to browbeat CBO as repeated modifications of the bill continued to exceed one-trillion dollars.\u00a0 They finally came out with a cost estimate of $940 billion, and this was sufficient to get the support of some wavering Democrats who didn\u2019t want to be tagged with a $1 Trillion expenditure.\u00a0 At the time, many Congressional critics said that it would come in far higher since the CBO was using a static scoring that didn\u2019t account for economic conditions at large.\u00a0 Much of the near doubling of the costs are accounted for by a weaker economy than they had estimated at the time.\u00a0 This is typical CBO estimating:\u00a0 Look at the sky today, see it is blue, and estimate the cost for umbrellas over the next ten years will be zero.\u00a0 As you\u2019re drenched for lack of an umbrella, they will explain that their estimates didn\u2019t account for the dynamics of weather.\nThe entire Obama-care scam is just now kicking into high gear.\u00a0 Over the next eighteen months, as new features and taxes kick in, along with the mandates and penalties, I don\u2019t think most small or even medium businesses quite grasp how badly this is going to affect their bottom lines.\u00a0 This is because much of it\u00a0 has been hidden, and many large corporations have managed to obtain exemptions from the Obama administration.\u00a0 It\u2019s not clear that those exemptions are even legal, and it\u2019s fairly certain they will end early in a second Obama term.\u00a0 Our best hope is that the Supreme Court overturns the whole law, since there is no severability clause in this law, meaning that to throw out one portion, for instance the individual mandate, all portions of the law must go.\u00a0 If that happens, we\u2019ll be extraordinarily fortunate, but we must plan on the fact that this is going to go forward irrespective of the desires of more than 65% of the American people, who oppose it.\nWhen you see Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, or Barack Obama, or any other Democrat who supported and voted for this law, you can assume they are liars, one and all, and that they knew full well that this program was going to cost significantly more than advertised.\u00a0 They lied, because it was the only way to get even their own members to vote for it, not because those members believed the lies, but because it gave them plausible political cover.\u00a0 Know this: If your member of Congress or your Senators voted for this bill, despite what they may say now, they knew it was an underestimate based on willful ignorance.\u00a0 You should cast your votes accordingly at the next opportunity.\n"}], [{"score": 1098.3813, "uuid": "f34abd26-f333-555f-af7d-2780eef44fac", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1105wb-19-19297", "target_hostname": "markamerica.com", "target_uri": "http://markamerica.com/tag/obamacare/", "page_rank": 1.310539e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Obamacare</em> \u00ab Mark America", "snippet": "This result was a virtual inevitability, and for those who think this <em>is</em> over, you\u2019d <em>better</em> brace yourselves: By the time <em>Obamacare</em> fully takes effect, there will be roughly ten million more Americans who will file to receive it <em>than</em> had been projected, if the current trend continues.

I\u2019m not going to let charlatans parade around as though they are anything other than what the facts reveal.\nIf you\u2019re a college student, or anybody else for that matter, and you wish to avoid pregnancy, but cannot afford your own contraceptives, there\u2019s a simple answer, and as Foster Freiss might offer, it may involve an aspirin .\u00a0 As a member of the paying public, my first response when you demand free contraception is:\n\u201cNothing is free.

JOHN THUNE | 3/23/11 4:41 AM EDT\nIt has been one year since Obamacare was signed into law.\nThis is the same law about which then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, \u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.\u201d It is the same law that Pelosi and her Democratic colleagues jammed through Congress. The same unpopular law that led to Democrats losing control of the House.\nreset\nPOLITICO 44\nAfter a year of learning what is in the law \u2014 and seeing its effect on families, small businesses and our economy \u2014 it is now clear that Obamacare is a failed experiment. Sadly, this failure was predictable and very expensive.\nWhen Sen. Barack Obama was running for president, he repeatedly promised that he was going to reduce \u201cevery family\u2019s premiums by as much as $2,500.\u201d We were supposed to see these savings by the end of 2012.\nDespite these promises, the amount individuals and families pay for health care and insurance continues to rise. Average premiums for individual plans, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, are predicted to increase by $2,100 per family over the next five years under the law.\nInstead of receiving the $2,500 reduction promised, families will be paying more and more for their health insurance, thanks in no small part to the new government mandates.\nThe average American worker is likely to pay a whopping 12 percent more this year in premiums compared with 2010, according to a recent employer survey by Towers Watson. In addition to those higher premiums, many families will very likely have to pay higher deductibles and co-payments.\nIt is not just insurance costs. According to the chief actuary for Medicare, total health costs in the United States are expected to grow by more than $310 billion by the end of the decade.\nIn the following decades, billions of dollars more will most likely be spent to prop up the law\u2019s new health care entitlement program, the Community Living Assistance Services and Support Act. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has admitted that this program is \u201ctotally unsustainable,\u201d and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) has described it as \u201ca Ponzi scheme of the first order.\u201d Unless repealed, the CLASS Act will pile untold burdens onto future budgets.\n1\n"}, {"score": 1069.0632, "uuid": "51232c2f-2b80-5f64-9f08-8d5cd2538543", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1204wb-00-24987", "target_hostname": "dailycapitalist.com", "target_uri": "http://dailycapitalist.com/2009/07/10/obamacare/", "page_rank": 1.1802077e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "<em>Obamacare</em> | The Daily Capitalist", "snippet": "It <em>is</em> estimated that spending on health care, public and private, has increased 66% faster <em>than</em> without this plan.

Yet the proponents of the plan promised taxpayers that these things would never happen.", "explanation": null, "document": "By Jeff Harding, on July 10th, 2009\nBy Jeff Harding\nFair warning: this is one of those ad hominem attacks on President Obama, just so you\u2019ll know.\nI question the motives of a politician who says things like government-run national health care will bring good medical care to everyone, that it\u2019s a cost savings measure, it\u2019s a budget balancing program, and that it will not require an increase in taxes on the middle class.\nOn July 7, 2009, President Obama said :\nI am pleased by the progress we\u2019re making on health care reform and still believe, as I\u2019ve said before, that one of the best ways to bring down costs, provide more choices, and assure quality is a public option that will force the insurance companies to compete and keep them honest,\u201d the president said in the statement. \u201cI look forward to a final product that achieves these very important goals.\nPresident Obama knows these statements are lies.\nWhy is it that no one in the government can come up with an idea for delivering health care to people other than through a government-run plan? Just on the face of it you would have to question their premise. If they can\u2019t run the post office, Medicare, or anything else efficiently, what makes anyone think they can run the 16% of the economy that is health care?\nYet they continue to press for some form of government-run national health care. To be fair, they have quite a bit of support from their voters who are frustrated with the current \u201cfree market\u201d system.\nWhat everyone wants is a system that gives them good health care, insurance coverage at a fair price, choice as to doctors, access to the best technology, and the knowledge that they won\u2019t go broke because of medical bills. Sounds fair.\nWhat is the best way to deliver that to consumers? Or, to put it the way President Obama would, \u201cwhat works?\u201d\nTo come up with the best system possible, why don\u2019t we first take a critical look at the systems around the world that are run or sponsored by governments. Do some research and find out what works and what doesn\u2019t.\nOf course the reason the Administration doesn\u2019t want to do that is because all these public health care systems have problems containing costs, have some form of care rationing, and are raising taxes to cover budget shortfalls.\nIt is clear from a survey of current systems around the world that the programs that offer the best chance of achieving our goals are the ones that have the least amount of government control. The systems that have the most top-down government control are the ones that least meet these goals.\nHeavy handed government-run single-payers programs in countries like Great Britain, Canada, and Norway have the least amount of consumer satisfaction, the highest costs, health care rationing, and delays in getting care.\nCountries such as France, Netherlands, and Switzerland with national health care systems that are more market oriented, with managed competition, allow consumer choice, cost savings incentives, and market pricing are far more successful.\nEvery country that has a form of national health care is facing rising costs. More and more they are turning to more market based incentives to better manage costs, increase efficiency, and allow more consumer satisfaction.\nBy the way, every country to some extent has the same problems Americans complain about: gatekeeper issues, cumbersome prior approvals, lack of access to experimental treatment, and delays in getting treatment.\nIn light of all the evidence to the contrary why does President Obama continue to press for a public option plan whereby the government would compete with private insurers? It\u2019s because he wants to drive out private companies and replace them with a single-payer system similar to the Medicare system. Since it is estimated that Medicare wastes about one-third of program spending, why go there?\nRight now there are three bills pending in Congress They each have mandates for employers and individuals to purchase policies, purchase subsidies for the middle class, increased insurance regulation, and a government-run health care plan, like Medicare, that will compete with private insurance. They are similar to the highly regarded Massachusetts plan.\nIf anything should convince us not to go down this road, it is the Massachusetts program. After only three years of operation, insurance premiums are shooting up, subsidies to help citizens to purchase policies are skyrocketing ($1.9 billion in 2008), and choice is being limited. Sin taxes have been raised but not enough to keep up with cost increases. It is estimated that spending on health care, public and private, has increased 66% faster than without this plan. Governor Patrick is now talking about rationing care (\u201cmanage costs better\u201d). Yet the proponents of the plan promised taxpayers that these things would never happen.\nThere is also a moral aspect to Obamacare that they don\u2019t like to talk about.\nWhat if I came to you and said that I have a great idea on how we can have everything we want without paying for it. How, you would ask, could we do that? I would answer that we\u2019ll just have the kids and grandkids pay for it. Who cares, we\u2019ll be dead.\nIn other words, instead of spending our money, we\u2019ll load ourselves up with benefits and spend our kids\u2019 and grandkids\u2019 money to pay for it. You might say, that\u2019s not fair, they haven\u2019t even earned it yet. We can\u2019t spend money that hasn\u2019t been earned yet. We can\u2019t commit them to something they don\u2019t even know that\u2019s coming.\nYes we can!\nI think it is fair to assume, based on published reports of past predictions on the cost of federal social welfare programs that the cost of Obamacare will be much greater than the Administration projects. Even if you support the program you have to admit this truth.\nWe all know that the projected $1.7 trillion cost of the new plan will really be much more. Who will ultimately pay for it? [Play the thinking-over-your-answer music from Jeopardy] Yes, you\u2019re right! Your children and grandchildren.\nHere\u2019s what the Cato Institute says :\nMedicare and Medicaid are the reason that the size of the federal budget will double from 20 percent to 40 percent of GDP within 80 years. Medicare\u2019s unfunded liabilities are in the neighborhood of $80 trillion. The CBO estimates that all income-tax rates would have nearly to double by mid-century (top rate: 66 percent), and increase by nearly 150 percent by 2082 (top rate: 88 percent), just to pay for existing federal programs. If Congress creates a new government health program instead of reforming the ones we\u2019ve got, tax increases will be inevitable and painful: The CBO estimates that by 2050, economic output could be 20 percent lower than if government remained at its current share of GDP.\nThere is no question that we have a system that needs reform. But keep in mind, contrary to what Michael Moore\u2019s propaganda says (SiCKO), we have the best quality care in the world. Thousands of people from around the world come here to get medical rather than at home (just ask Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi).\nThere are many free market proposals to \u201cfix\u201d the system which would result in better health care delivered to most of the population without the waste, lack of choice, rationing, runaway costs, and massive tax increases always associated with publicly run systems.\nLet\u2019s go with what works.\nFor more information on this issue, go to Cato on Health Care Reform .

It ensures that women are covered equally, the 32 million uninsured will now have access to affordable insurance, and that insurance companies cannot use pre-existing conditions to determine coverage or fees.\nSome health insurance companies are taking a pro-active approach and moving forward with meeting the standards of the new health care law. Aetna, one of the-largest health insurance companies in the country, said it was moving forward with innovations such as \"accountable care organizations\" that reward medical professionals for providing preventive care rather than stepping in only when someone gets sick. More than 200 doctors in the Aetna network get paid more when they can show they have regularly reached out to patients to manage their health.\nOn Monday through Wednesday next week four arguments will be presented in the U.S. Supreme Court to determine the fate of the health care law mandate, according to Cantor and Seton Hall law professor John V.

As one provision or another of the law kicks in, more people are conditioned to its benefits and discount the lies they have heard.\nLast week, the Census Bureau\u2019s annual health survey reported that in the first quarter of 2011 more than 900,000 young adults obtained health insurance. They took advantage of a provision in the new health law allowing them to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until they are 27. It was the first time in years that the share of young adults who were not insured fell. They are no longer the age group most apt to be uninsured.\nThe growth rate of Medicare spending, the issue that is driving the deficit-reduction war, is declining as hospitals and other providers react to the law\u2019s mandates to achieve efficiency and quality. The elderly poor and disabled are paying less for drugs under the overhauled Part D drug program and they will pay even less in January.\nBut the next best advantage to time may be the debates, that is, if many people other than the hard Republican right are watching. Every Republican candidate promises to ask Congress to repeal the law but none of them is equipped to say why the reforms should be stopped except for hollow generalities about government \u201cinterference\u201d in medical care. You have to believe that halfway thoughtful listeners are beginning to suspect that the candidates don\u2019t know what they are talking about and that the scary scenarios they\u2019ve heard for two years may be fictional, as an occasional weak-kneed Democrat may have hinted.\nAnd many surely have been horrified at what they have heard, if not from the candidates themselves then from the lusty tea-party crowds that fill the debate halls.\nWhen Wolf Blitzer, the moderator of the tea-party sponsored debate, asked what the candidates, since they would repeal the law that will cover everyone, would do about a comatose 30-year-old who did not have or could not afford insurance. Would they let the young person die? The crowd screamed \u201cyeah.\u201d\nNone of the candidates wanted to answer the question, but Rep. Ron Paul, the pristine libertarian and the one thoroughly honest candidate, tried. People aren\u2019t dying for lack of care, he said, because someone is going to see that they get treated. He said the young man should have obtained insurance in advance. Paul said it was not the government\u2019s business to see that everyone was protected from the high cost of medical care. The private market and charity will take of such situations.\nNever mind that dozens of studies have shown that large numbers of people do die every year owing to lack of care or to treatment that was delayed because they were uninsured and could not afford the care.\nA blogger was unkind enough to raise the case of Paul\u2019s 2008 campaign manager, the fund-raising genius Kent Snyder, who got pneumonia during the campaign and died two weeks after Paul ended his presidential race. Snyder could not get insurance because he had a pre-existing condition. He got care but left $400,000 in unpaid medical bills, which like tens of thousands of such cases will be passed along to insured people through higher premiums. Snyder\u2019s friends, including Ron Paul\u2019s staff, started a campaign to raise money to pay the bills but it shut down after collecting only $34,870.\nPaul\u2019s advice that Blitzer\u2019s comatose young man should have insured himself would have been futile for his campaign manager. Every insurance company denied Snyder coverage but starting in 2013, the month when one of the Republicans may become president, the Affordable Care Act will require insurance companies to insure people with pre-existing conditions.\nNearly all the debate exchanges on health care have been about Mitt Romney\u2019s Massachusetts health-care law, which was the template for the most controversial parts of the national law. Both require people to obtain health insurance, with some financial help from the government, or else pay a small tax or penalty. His opponents blame Romney for the federal law.\nRomney\u2019s pre-campaign book, No Apology, boasts of his state\u2019s universal insurance law and suggests that something similar should be done nationally. The book came out in March 2010, three weeks before President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act. Romney revised the book for the paperback edition this year to remove the sentence about taking his health reforms national. He now says he didn\u2019t mean it the way it sounded.\nWill anyone but the unalloyed crazies believe that something that is very good for the people of Massachusetts and apparently popular will be bad for everyone else?\nHalfway sentient viewers also would think there is something hollow about exclamations like Herman Cain\u2019s. Cain has opposed health-insurance reforms\u2014all of them\u2014for two decades because businessmen like himself might be pressured into helping pay for insurance for their employees. Cain, the winner of the Florida straw poll, said the other night that if \u201cObamacare\u201d were the law he would have died two years ago because government bureaucrats would not have let him have surgery for colon and liver cancer. The crowd groaned in sympathy.\nLong before the first sentence of the Affordable Care Act was drafted, Republicans said it would allow government bureaucrats, not patients and doctors, to determine the care a person received. But nothing in the new law would prevent Cain\u2019s getting treatment or give a government bureaucrat authority to determine the treatment he receives. No one asked Cain to support his claim.\nSuch nonsense would be laid bare in a real debate with someone who knows, like the president, but even in a chorus of true believers it rings hollow to anyone faintly interested in the truth.\n"}, {"score": 1055.9185, "uuid": "d162223d-a25a-5c8a-9ac0-6f597bc4b2fd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1615wb-80-01996", "target_hostname": "www.guaranteedhealthcare.org", "target_uri": "http://www.guaranteedhealthcare.org/tags/obamacare", "page_rank": 1.2080843e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>ObamaCare</em> | Guaranteed Healthcare", "snippet": "Posted by John Geyman MD PNHP on July 13, 2010 - 5:29pm The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) <em>is</em> being touted by its proponents as moving the country to near-universal coverage and a great step ahead in U.S. health care.

By a narrow margin, 220-215, the 1,990 page, almost 20 pound bill was passed. It laid out the most liberal health care reform that might be expected out of Congress this year, since any bill that may clear the Senate will certainly be more restrictive.\nIn order to answer our question as to the value of the House bill, we need to re-state the original major goals of reform: (1) contain skyrocketing costs of health care and health insurance; (2) expand access to care by including everyone; and (3) improve the quality of care.\nAt a gross cost of $1.055 trillion over ten years, the House bill would do some good things, including reduction of the uninsured by up to 30 million; helping many Americans to pay for insurance through government subsidies; helping small business to provide coverage to their employees; expanding Medicaid and community health centers; establishing a new Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research to study and recommend the most effective treatments; initiating limited reforms of the health insurance industry, such as termination (four years hence) of its common practice of denying coverage based on health status and pre-existing conditions; phasing out government overpayments to private Medicare Advantage plans; revoking a decade-old anti-trust exemption for insurance companies; and creating a new long-term care program (CLASS ACT) to supplement Medicaid and/or private long-term care insurance.\nHowever, the negatives far outweigh the positives, and adopting this bill would delay real reform for years to come. Despite a chorus of accolades about the bill by its supporters, even comparing it with the historic importance of Social Security and Medicare, this monster bill instead bears the heavy imprint of corporate stakeholders who themselves are largely responsible for out-of-control health care costs. After months of lobbying and campaign contributions to legislators crafting the legislation, their multiple conflicts of interest and political compromises, this bill ends up being a bailout for the insurance industry and a bonanza for stakeholders in the medical industrial complex.\nPermalink :: Discuss (5 comments)\nHEALTH CARE REFORM 2009: NO BILL IS BETTER THAN A BAD BILL\nPosted by John Geyman MD PNHP on November 4, 2009 - 10:45pm\nThe new House bill for health care reform (HR 3962), unveiled by Speaker Nancy Pelosi on October 29th, will not fundamentally reform U.S. health care.\nIf you were to believe the hype that accompanied its release, you might think that it would be as important as Medicare and Social Security. The <em>New York Times</em> concluded that \"This bill will take a long stride toward universal coverage while remaining fiscally responsible.\" Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman added: \"The political environment is as favorable for reform as it's likely to get. The legislation on the table isn't perfect, but it's as good as anyone could reasonably have expected.\"\nBut this bill is not good enough to pass. It will not make a big enough difference in addressing the three main problems requiring reform--containing the spiraling costs of health care, providing universal access to affordable health care, and improving its quality. If we look at the provisions of this 1,990-page bill concerning just the first two of these three goals, we see that it will fail to deliver real reform.\nPermalink :: Discuss (2 comments)\nHEALTH CARE REFORM: TIME FOR AN END RUN\nPosted by John Geyman MD PNHP on September 21, 2009 - 1:55pm\nWe have seen this coming for many weeks, but the release of the Baucus plan in recent days by the Senate Finance Committee, without any Republican support within the Gang of Six, leaves no more doubt about Republican intentions or votes on health care reform.

If insurance companies were not so greedy for profit people could have the best care they deserve. ", "explanation": null, "document": "March 23, 2010\nby Mario Rizzo\nThe very factors responsible for the passage of Obamacare may make it impossible to fund it adequately. There are certain myths about medical care that make it difficult to contain costs. The central myth, in not very exaggerated form, is that any care less than the best for anyone is the result of a contrived scarcity. If insurance companies were not so greedy for profit people could have the best care they deserve.\nSpurred on by irresponsible politicians, many people object to attempts by insurance companies to save money by denying coverage for pre-existing conditions or treatments whose efficacy has not been proven, refusing to\u00a0exceed certain pre-agreed-upon lifetime or yearly caps, exclusion of dental care, (previously) poor reimbursement for psychiatric services, and so forth.\nSo the supporters of Obamacare turned to government to make things better. Government will eliminate the contrived scarcity insurance market. (Of course, this is\u00a0contrived by greed, even though this sector is already highly-regulated and filled with mandates.)\nHowever, for Obamacare to work fiscally certain healthcare savings must materialize. Why? Well, because we live in a world of scarcity. Medical technologies and new drugs can be quite expensive. They can have small, but often noticeable benefits, in diagnosing, curing or alleviating illness. Some may give people just an extra few months of life or make what remains of higher quality.\nBut many people have an enduring faith that government knows how to eliminate greed in the provision of healthcare and to distribute it \u201cfairly\u201d when true scarcity raises its head.\nIn the first place, we do not have any generally-agreed upon notion of fairness when it comes to the allocation of (medical) resources. Second, because of this there is plenty of room for politically powerful interest groups to push resources in their own direction under the banner of fairness.\nGreg Mankiw helpfully published some of the cost-savings caveats that the Congressional Budget Office issued as a supplement to their cost estimates for the latest bill:\nThe reconciliation proposal and H.R. 3590 would maintain and put into effect a number of policies that might be difficult to sustain over a long period of time. Under current law, payment rates for physicians\u2019 services in Medicare would be reduced by about 21 percent in 2010 and then decline further in subsequent years; the proposal makes no changes to those provisions. At the same time, the legislation includes a number of provisions that would constrain payment rates for other providers of Medicare services. In particular, increases in payment rates for many providers would be held below the rate of inflation (in expectation of ongoing productivity improvements in the delivery of health care). The projected longer-term savings for the legislation also reflect an assumption that the Independent Payment Advisory Board established by H.R. 3590 would be fairly effective in reducing costs beyond the reductions that would be achieved by other aspects of the legislation.\nUnder the legislation, CBO expects that Medicare spending would increase significantly more slowly during the next two decades than it has increased during the past two decades (per beneficiary, after adjusting for inflation). It is unclear whether such a reduction in the growth rate of spending could be achieved, and if so, whether it would be accomplished through greater efficiencies in the delivery of health care or through reductions in access to care or the quality of care. The long-term budgetary impact could be quite different if key provisions of the legislation were ultimately changed or not fully implemented.\nIt seems to me that seniors are a very powerful interest group when it comes to getting health-care resources. And I have no doubt that they will be able to put a sympathy-inducing face on their plight. They will say there is \u201cno need\u201d to cut their services to provide services to others. They will find some greed somewhere to blame for this \u2013 perhaps the greed of the rich who don\u2019t pay enough in taxes.\nThis is how it will go. Decisions will be politicized, and not made in accordance with the ideas of\u00a0an Ethics Tsar.\nSome will no doubt say that\u00a0government-sponsored healthcare\u00a0takes money out of medical decisions. Instead of rationing by ability to pay we shall have allocation by other, better criteria.\nYet the criteria of special interests (with money) are not obviously better than willingness to pay. At least the latter has the advantage of spurring innovation.\nWhat we need is a recognition that not everyone can get the best care all of the time and that resources must be used efficiently. The question is will this be done in a market-friendly way (medical savings accounts, competition of insurance companies across state lines, etc.) or by central\u00a0 direction?\nThis, as always, is the question of our age.\nShare this:\n"}], [{"score": 1041.9225, "uuid": "73abe591-714a-55b3-bd91-b034f747a3e3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-46-10620", "target_hostname": "spectator.org", "target_uri": "http://spectator.org/archives/2012/04/03/ten-ways-that-obamacare-is-bad", "page_rank": 1.2788398e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "The American Spectator : Ten Ways That <em>Obamacare</em> <em>Is</em> Bad Law", "snippet": "If <em>Obamacare</em> <em>is</em> run like <em>any</em> other Government agency, ie.

We will discuss our litigation strategy about the healthcare bill. I will update you on facebook after the conference call.\nSo far as we can tell, and readers are welcome to educate us otherwise if you\u2019ve got further information, Texas doesn\u2019t have a bill in the works to fight Obamacare specifically \u2013 so the basis of the Lone Star State\u2019s challenge might be a little different than the other 37 or so states. We\u2019ll see what Abbott comes back with.\nUpdate 3-21, 6:55 PM (from MacAoidh): We\u2019re down to House Republicans\u2019 Last Stand At The Alamo, and as last stands go this one isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s a Motion To Recommit, and it dredges the Stupak clan back into play \u2013 possibly.\nFrom TheHill.com \u2026\nDemocrats are worried about holding their members together on a GOP motion that could kill the healthcare bill.\nRep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) said House leaders are specifically concerned about a Republican motion to recommit that would contain only language on abortion that Stupak originally had wanted to include in the Senate bill.\nThe concern is based on the fear of GOP attack ads painting Democrats who vote against a motion to recommit that includes Stupak\u2019s favored language on abortion as \u201cflip-floppers\u201d on the issue.\nSixty-eight Democrats voted for Stupak\u2019s language in a November vote. They could be portrayed as flipping if they now voted against it.\n\u201cThey are concerned about it,\u201d Stupak said after his Sunday press conference.\nThe effect of this, if it passes, would be to kill the thing. Passing it would put the pro-abortion Democrats in position to have to vote for a House bill with Stupak language in it, and they won\u2019t go for it. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi likely won\u2019t even reintroduce it, particularly since a Stupak-laden House Bill going back to the Senate probably won\u2019t get it done.\nThe question is whether the Republicans would put anything else in the bill. As blogger Drew M. at Ace of Spades notes , there\u2019s no point in them doing that \u2013 Republican amendments make it a loser. But if it\u2019s just Stupak, it\u2019s actually possible given the numbers that 216 votes can be found for it.\nWorth a shot.\nUpdate 3-21, 5:20 PM (from MacAoidh): Now comes another card being played by the Republicans \u2013 they say the Reconciliation bill violates the 1974 Congressional Budget Act , Section 310(g) of which, they say, would make it out of order for the Senate to take up a bill which deals with dispensing of Social Security savings (the Reconciliation Bill says $29 billion\u00a0in increased revenues\u00a0for Social Security are coming) outside of Social Security. The GOP is asking for a meeting with the Senate Democrats and the Parliamentarian in an attempt to deal with the controversy, and nobody will take the meeting at present.\nUpdate 3-21, 4:45 PM (from MacAoidh): This one\u2019s going to be interesting: Stupak has an intriguing Republican challenger in Dan Benishek , who is a doctor and a conservative. Check out his facebook page , which apparently has picked up some pretty massive momentum in the last couple of hours. Benishek doesn\u2019t have a website up yet; he only announced his candidacy this week.\nUpdate 3-21, 3:10 PM (from MacAoidh): Stupak and his group have officially flipped, and he just confirmed that he\u2019s flipping for the Executive Order deal. So Pelosi and Obama win this round. The executive order will be signed AFTER the vote, which means his head is squarely in the lion\u2019s mouth.\nIf you\u2019re wondering about Stupak\u2019s commitment to the pro-life cause, you\u2019re not alone. Allahpundit at HotAir quotes POLITICO\u2019s piece confirming the deal :\nThe White House and anti-abortion Democrats have reached an agreement to defusethe controversy over abortion in the health reform bill \u2013 planning a series of steps that will secure the support of Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) and other Democrats to give party leaders the votes they need to pass reform, sources tell POLITICO.\nUnder the agreement, President Barack Obama would sign an executive order ensuring that no federal funding will go to pay for abortion under the health reform plans. In addition, Stupak will get to state his concerns about abortion funding in the bill during a colloquy on the House floor during the debate.\nAnd then, Stupak and several other Democratic hold-outs over abortion will sign on to the bill, the sources said\u2026\nRep. Alan Mollohan, who is one of the votes in question, told POLITICO that the language in the agreement has already been essentially cleared. Mollohan said it is only a matter of time for \u201cthe follow-through steps\u201d to be implemented.\n\u2026and then offers his own take, which we think has a lot of validity:\nSo he caved for a wafer-thin executive order and a little floor time to praise life? Geez. Cheap date, Bart.\nUpdate 3-21, 2:00 PM: Stupak just told repoters that there is still no deal and the negotiations are sometimes like \u201cone step forward, two steps back.\u201d\u00a0 Since he still has nine members (though some could certainly still cave at the last minute), The White House must make the deal if Obamacare is to pass.\u00a0 Even if Pelosi were to get the other five undecided votes, the Stupak nine would defeat the bill by three votes.\u00a0 Even though I, sadly,\u00a0still fully expect the deal to get done and for Obamacare to pass, I\u2019m pleased that the pro-life movement is holding this bill hostage and extracting major concessions from President Obama.\u00a0 A week ago, who would have thought that the drama over this vote would end with President Obama issuing a detailed\u00a0executive order prohibiting public funds from being used to pay for abortions?\nUpdate 3-21, 1:50 PM: Don\u2019t have time to link, but Foster and Baird are now yes votes and Lincoln Davis is a no.\u00a0 Since he now makes 209 confirmed no votes, Pelosi can\u2019t get to 216 without finalizing the details on Stupak, so they will have to do that.\nUpdate 3-21, 1:35 PM: Oh, what the heck \u2026 I\u00a0guess I can do one last update. Tanner is a NO .\u00a0 Just for the sake of counting, that puts the solid NO count at 208.\u00a0 And for what it\u2019s worth, Stupak has told CNN that he and the White House lawyers are still working out the last few final details and he isn\u2019t officially a YES vote yet, but that he expects to be very soon.\u00a0 In case you missed it earlier, Kaptur caved and broke off of the Stupak group \u2014 she just couldn\u2019t wait to say that she was for Obamacare.\u00a0 As I noted earlier in the week, Tom Delay had predicted that, saying that she\u2019s just too liberal to possibly vote NO.\nUpdate 3-21, 12:38 PM: Those of you who have followed this post for the last several days know that I was once extraordinarily confident that the vote on Obamacare would fail in the House.\u00a0 I was obviously very, very wrong.\u00a0 If any of you bet against Obamacare on Intrade after reading here, then I am extremely sorry \u2014 you\u2019ll know better than to believe me next time.\u00a0 I\u2019ll write a separate post this evening explaining why I was wrong, for those who are interested (and link to it from here).\u00a0 Curious as I am to see exactly how everyone votes, I won\u2019t be able to watch today\u2019s proceedings, as I have to work.\u00a0 As some of you may know, I own and run the Mathnasium learning center in Baton Rouge, and we\u2019re always extremely busy the week after report cards go home.\u00a0 Thanks for reading this past week.\nUpdate 3-21, 12:13 PM: According to MSNBC, Stupak has agreed to a deal and will vote yes.\u00a0 That\u2019s all she wrote, folks.\u00a0 Obamacare will pass.\nUpdate 3-21, 10:10 AM (from MacAoidh): I\u2019m working on a piece for the front page (I\u2019ll post a link here when it\u2019s done) which discusses reasons why the assumption of inevitability that Obamacare once enacted will continue to grow is false. As said many times elsewhere, this would be the first social legislation of major scale to be enacted without bipartisan support, and it\u2019s also the first time the majority which would enact such legislation would be likely to be turned out of office immediately thereafter. There are other reasons why this one is different, and I\u2019ll get into those, plus expand on the above, in the piece I\u2019m working on for later today.\nA few developments to report: first, TheHill.com reports that Bart Stupak is still negotiating with the White House on an executive order which would purportedly ban federal funding of abortions; this one will go down to the wire, but if Stupak ends up playing ball, moving his group into the \u201cyes\u201d column and dragging Obamacare over the finish line only to find himself double-crossed by the President and the House leadership \u2013 which is likely if not certain to happen \u2013 it could be the end of pro-life Democrats in American politics.\nSecond, former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin writes in the New York Times this morning that the real, accurate budget effect of Obamacare isn\u2019t $1.3 trillion in deficit reduction, as Obama claims, or $138 billion as the current CBO score would indicate, or $58 billion in red ink, as Paul Ryan says is the case once the \u201cdoctor fix\u201d is put in place, but $562 billion.\nYikes.\nAnd third, the latest count among the cable-news networks has Obamacare with 216 House supporters \u2013 maybe. Fox News counts it at 216-215, though their numbers have been shaky from the get-go, and CNN says it\u2019s razor-thin. Rep. John Larson, D-CT, who is the Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, is bragging that they have the votes. But Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, the House Deputy Whip, admitted to Fox News that it\u2019s not a \u201chard 216.\u201d\nUpdate 3-21, 8:20 AM: Politico has some guesses on how the final undecideds will break.\u00a0 If they are right, then Kaptur, Berry,\u00a0and Mollohan are the ones peeling off the Stupak group.\u00a0 They think Pelosi can convince Pomeroy to end his politcal career in North Dakota, and that she will get Tanner and Baird to vote yes.\u00a0 Those assumptions are not unreasonable.\u00a0 But they appear to already be counting Rahall\u2019s vote in their starting at 210 for Pelosi, which is puzzling, as he is also part of the Stupak group and has firmly pledged to vote no absent a deal on abortion.\u00a0 So, the deal narrows the Stupak group to six and Pelosi gets Pomeroy and she wins.\nUpdate 3-21, 7:43 AM: There isn\u2019t any news yet this morning, except I saw more confirmation from last night that some unnamed members of Stupak\u2019s group were agreeing to a deal on an executive order.\u00a0 There\u2019s certainly still hope that the deal could fall through, but, at this point, I finally have to shed my optimism.\u00a0 I can write that Pelosi still didn\u2019t have the votes last night, and I can write that I still expect to get Pomeroy, Davis, and Boucher, and that those plus six Stupak members would be the 216 we need to defeat the bill, but the reality is that the bill won\u2019t lose by one vote.\u00a0 Pelosi will simply hold the machines open and convince someone to \u201ctake one for the team\u201d and switch his vote.\u00a0 The reality is that, unless Stupak fights back and manages to keep eight or nine members of his group together (or we catch a couple of breaks like with Sanchez), that Pelosi will be able to flip votes on the floor and win.\nThe likelihood of Pelosi flipping a vote or two during the vote if necessary is why Rep. Gene Taylor (D-Miss) is basically advising members to vote no and run for your life .\nUpdate 3-20, 11:00 PM: This is it for tonight.\u00a0 From tomorrow\u2019s Washington Post :\nHouse leaders were working to secure their votes late Saturday with the promise of an executive order affirming President Obama \u2018s commitment to a longstanding ban on public abortion funding except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), a key antiabortion vote, said she thought the document would be insufficient to bring the entire group of about 10 antiabortion Democrats onboard.\nOf course, he doesn\u2019t need all of them.\nUpdate 3-20, 10:50 PM: Jane Hamsher makes a good argument for counting Sanchez as a NO.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to count her that way, since she hasn\u2019t said that she will vote no.\u00a0 Since the article in Roll Call said that House leadership weren\u2019t assured that she would return to DC for the vote (!), I should mention that an absence is as good as a NO vote.\u00a0 If the vote is 215-215, it fails.\nUpdate 3-20, 9:25 PM: While I was typing the post below, Schrader announced that he will vote yes.\nUpdate 3-20, 8:40 PM: Since we\u2019re unlikely to get more news tonight, I thought I would run down the numbers and possibilities.\u00a0 Republicans have 206 publicly committed votes.\u00a0 We need 216 to defeat the bill.\u00a0 There were ten members of the Stupak group:\nStupak\nCostello\nBerry\nObviously, if all of those held, that would be enough to defeat the bill, but the cryptic comment of Stupak that he had lost votes and\u00a0\u201dat least six\u201d will stand opposed is still puzzling.\u00a0 There are also still five uncommitted members who voted NO in November:\nBaird\nBoucher\nL. Davis\nPelosi likely has Baird and Tanner in her back pocket, especially Baird.\u00a0 Davis\u2019 situation I detailed below, Boucher represents an overwhelmingly Republican district and\u00a0said last week that he would vote against the bill if it had big cuts to Medicare (and it does), and Nye represents a Republican district and faces a strong challenge to re-election.\u00a0 I think that the three of them are likely to vote NO.\nFinally, we have the non-Stupak\u00a0ones who voted YES in November but that we would like to flip our way:\nOrtiz\nSchrader\nRon Klein\nSanchez is a new addition to my list.\u00a0 She\u2019s been a presumed YES vote, but it turns out that she didn\u2019t want to vote yes last time and was actually the final Dem to vote in favor.\u00a0 She said this week that \u201cthe Senate bill is a bad bill,\u201d and she is facing a serious challenge this fall. She spent today in Florida (yes, you read that correctly) \u2014 thus avoiding getting buttonholed by the House leadership, who now reportedly list her as a NO.\u00a0 I also see Schrader, Ortiz, Klein, and Kanjorski as possible votes our way\u00a0\u2013 they all have good reason to vote NO.\u00a0 And Pomeroy is a likely NO vote in my book.\nSo, I still see Nye, Boucher, Davis, and Pomeroy as likely for us.\u00a0 I also see another six as good possibilities.\u00a0 If we do get four votes from this group, then six from Stupak still wins it for us.\u00a0 And Pelosi still has a lot of other publicly uncommitted members, and we could still get one of those unexpectly, like we did with Lynch.\nUpdate 3-20, 8:00 PM: Since Stupak won\u2019t be part of the deliberations, I feel secure in my belief that this is an attempt to peel votes off Stupak, not to actually make a deal with him.\u00a0 One thing that isn\u2019t being discussed elsewhere is whether members of the Stupak group want there to be\u00a0a deal.\u00a0 I think that Stupak genuinely wanted to get his amendment passed and vote yes for Obamacare, but seven of the nine other members of his group represent districts where a NO vote (for any reason) would be popular and politically expedient.\u00a0 Supporting Stupak was a great way to keep the pressure off.\nSenior Dem staffer says abortion/executive order deliberations will take place tonight at the White House.\nStupak won\u2019t be there\u2026 Dem staffer says \u201cthis still isn\u2019t nailed down\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 7:40 PM: Zack Space wasn\u2019t \u201creleased\u201d to vote NO by Pelosi; he had been leaning NO for days.\u00a0 That\u2019s good news and confirms that Pelosi likely still doesn\u2019t have the votes locked up.\nUpdate 3-20, 7:35 PM: Rep. Capuano is a liberal who has finally decided to vote yes. Since I always had him that way, that doesn\u2019t change my count.\nUpdate 3-20, 7:30 PM: The Minority Leader\u2019s office is distributing the following comments about an Executive Order \u201cdeal\u201d:\nUS Conference of Catholic Bishops: \u201cNo regulation, policy letter from HRSA, or other executive action can withstand a statutory mandate, construed by federal courts applying a constitutional decision on abortion.\u201d\nNational Right to Life Committee: \u201cIf the [Senate] bill is signed into law, these statutory requirements and defects are not subject to correction or nullification by the chief executive or his appointees, whether by Executive Order, regulation, or otherwise.\u201d\nAmericans United for Life: \u201cThe proposal to address the problem of abortion funding in the health care bill through use of an Executive Order is a tacit acknowledgement that the bill as it stands is pro-abortion legislation \u2026 [I]t also does not succeed in application. An Executive Order cannot prevent insurance companies that pay for abortions from participating in the exchanges.\u00a0 Further, Executive Orders can be undone or modified as quickly as they are created.\u00a0 This is a blatant attempt to subvert democracy and should be quickly quashed.\u201d\nFamily Research Council warns against the promise of: \u201can Executive Order (EO) that would magically fix the fact that the Senate bill (H.R. 3590) would spend government funds to pay for elective abortions. Further, the Reconciliation bill will make matters worse by increasing funding for community health centers, which will bypass any abortion funding restrictions in appropriations bills because it is directly appropriated. Both taken together will fund abortion, regardless of any EO.\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 6:45 PM: Supposedly, Rep. Diana DeGette, the leader of the pro-choice caucus in the House, has signed off on the proposed Executive Order.\u00a0 If she\u2019s OK with it, then Stupak probably isn\u2019t, meaning that its design is to peel a few of his group off.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, we\u00a0have 206 NO votes that are absolutely rock solid.\u00a0 Of the eleven non-Stupak\u00a0undecided members, I think we get Nye, Boucher, Pomeroy, and Davis.\u00a0 If we could do that, we would still win with six votes from the Stupak group.\u00a0 Though I am no longer confidently predicting the defeat of the bill, it isn\u2019t over by a long shot.\nUpdate 3-20, 6:28 PM: One of the more curious situations is that of Rep. Lincoln Davis of Tennessee.\u00a0 He voted NO last time and represents a district that is 14 points more Republican than the country as a whole.\u00a0 He\u2019s not \u201cundecided;\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0has simply refused to give anyone any public indication of how he intends to vote.\u00a0 Is he refusing to say anything because he\u2019s pledged his vote to Pelosi and he doesn\u2019t want to have to hear it from his constituents, or is he refusing because he doesn\u2019t want union sit-ins staged in his office like the one that Rep. Altmire got after announcing that he would vote no?\u00a0 Because he voted no last time and because of the strong GOP tilt to his district, I would have to bet on the latter, but we\u2019ll see.\nUpdate 3-20, 6:17 PM: Will Pomeroy flip our way?\u00a0 North Dakota has a small population, so Rep. Earl Pomeroy represents the entire state.\u00a0 Now, North Dakota is about ten points more Republican than the country as a whole.\u00a0 A few hours ago, the North Dakota GOP\u00a0Convention selected State Rep. Rick Berg , the former majority\u00a0leader of the state house,\u00a0to run against Pomeroy.\u00a0 A Rasmussen poll last month showed Berg beating Pomeroy 46% to 40% , which was apparently a key factor in today\u2019s decision by the Convention.\u00a0 If Pomeroy votes yes, he is headed for certain defeat.\u00a0 As of a couple hours ago, Pomeroy was still telling reporters that he was \u201cundecided.\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 6:00 PM: I love this photo .\u00a0 It\u2019s Louisiana\u2019s own Steve Scalise, handing out copies of the U.S. Constitution on the Capitol steps.\nUpdate 3-20, 5:55 PM: One more thing to remember about the Stupak group:\u00a0 of the ten that I have left in the group, only Lipinski and Kaptur are in solidly Democratic districts.\u00a0 Stupak, Berry, Mollohan, Donnelly, Dahlkemper,\u00a0and Rahall all represent districts that lean Republican, and Driehaus\u2019 and Costello\u2019s districts lean Dem by 3 points or less.\u00a0 That means that, except for Lipinski and Kaptur, it\u2019s in their political best interest to vote against Obamacare regardless of its disposition of the abortion issue.\nUpdate 3-20, 5:40 PM: Those two no votes mean that Stupak could defeat the bill with seven, assuming that we don\u2019t get any more.\u00a0 But I still can\u2019t see Glenn Nye switching his vote to yes.\u00a0 If Nye votes no, then a Stupak group of six would be enough.\u00a0 On the other hand, if the President can craft an Executive Order that will satisfy Stupak, it\u2019s all over \u2014 always has been.\nUpdate 3-20, 5:36 PM: Jim Matheson is a NO. Giving his brother a nomination to the federal judiciary apparently did not sway his vote.\nUpdate 3-20, 5:08 PM: Zack Space is a NO. The question is, did Pelosi just give him permission to vote no because she\u2019s split the Stupak group and got enough votes?\u00a0 Space is the third confirmed yes-to-no flip outside of the Stupak group.\nUpdate 3-20, 5:00 PM: If you want to know a little more about the members believed in play, this article is a good place to start .\u00a0 Note that, since the article was written,\u00a0Carney and DeFazio have now committed for the bill.\nUpdate 3-20, 4:55 PM: I\u2019m still confused.\u00a0 I just re-read the article from The Hill that said that Stupak was down to six, and it still had Stupak speculating about a \u201cpossible\u201d executive order and what would be in it, so that couldn\u2019t explain how his eleven suddenly went down to \u201cat least six.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019ll find out eventually.\nUpdate 3-20, 4:43 PM: That\u2019s why the deal was always that Stupak and Stupak alone would negotiate and decide for the group.\u00a0 Something that splits the group is very bad \u2013\u00a0not just for Obamacare, but also for the pro-life movement.\u00a0 Pro-lifers needed this group of Democrats to stand together.\nUpdate 3-20, 4:33 PM: OK, this explains it: President Obama is issuing an Executive Order that will prohibit federal money from being used for abortions under this bill.\u00a0 What is likely happening is that the President has come up with something that\u2019s enough to satisfy some members of the Stupak group and get the bill over the line.\nUpdate 3-20, 4:20 PM: Something\u2019s fishy.\u00a0 Stupak didn\u2019t suddenly go from eleven members down to six.\u00a0 I think that quote was taken out of context somehow.\u00a0 As Firedoglake notes, the six mentioned in this article do not include Lipinski, Donnelly,\u00a0or Costello, some of the most outspoken members of the group.\u00a0\u00a0 If some are flipping, it would be Rahall, Kaptur, or Dahlkemper \u2014 and yet they are mentioned in the article as still being with Stupak.\nUpdate 3-20, 4:10 PM: If Stupak only has six, that means we would have to win more of the undecided members than Pelosi.\u00a0 That won\u2019t happen.\u00a0 On the other hand, Eric Cantor tells NRO: \u201cWe\u2019re still fighting and it\u2019s still very fluid.\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 4:00 PM: Stupak now says that his numbers are down to about six .\u00a0 If that is indeed the case, then Obamacare will pass.\nUpdate 3-20, 3:30 PM: Apparently, Rep. Boucher is not a firm \u201cno.\u201d\u00a0 That means we don\u2019t yet have the votes to defeat the bill.\nUpdate 3-20, 3:00 PM: Carney will vote yes .\u00a0 One down for Pelosi, twelve to go.\nUpdate 3-20, 2:35 PM: The list below\u00a0is of\u00a0the thirteen remaining truly undecided members.\u00a0 Pelosi needs all thirteen to win.\u00a0 There have been others that still say they are undecided but have really given strong indications of how they will vote, and almost all of those are the \u201cleaning yes\u201d types.\u00a0 So Pelosi could still lose one or two that we don\u2019t expect.\u00a0 Of these true undecided, though, the first five voted \u201cno\u201d last time, and this would be a flip.\u00a0 I feel very confident about Nye, who has consistently made signals that sound like \u201cno,\u201d and he is in a very tough re-election fight.\u00a0 I\u2019ve also been counting Space, who told Democratic leaders yesterday that he was strongly leaning towards a \u201cno.\u201d\u00a0 Berry, Carney and Kanjorski are pro-life.\u00a0\u00a0Though they aren\u2019t in Stupak\u2019s group, it\u2019s still a factor for them.\u00a0 Kanjorski would also lose jobs in his district from a Sallie Mae processing center which would be negatively affected by the student loan provisions in this bill.\u00a0 Baird and Tanner are retiring, and they clearly don\u2019t want to vote yes, but I expect that they will if Pelosi needs them.\nBaird, Brian\nSpace, Zack\nSchrader, Kurt\nUpdate 3-20, 2:32 PM: It isn\u2019t just DeFazio,\u00a0Pelosi finally got the whole regional Medicare situation \u201cfixed.\u201d\u00a0 Pelosi has filed this \u201cmanager\u2019s amendment\u201d to the legislation.\nUpdate 3-20, 2:30 PM: OK, this is Ryan again.\u00a0 I like how Firedoglake has finally realized that Schrader isn\u2019t a yes vote .\u00a0 I emailed them about this on Wednesday, and they ignored me.\u00a0 Our count has been far, far more accurate than anything else anywhere.\nUpdate 3-20, 2:12 PM (from MacAoidh): DeFazio has now flipped back to yes, according to Carl Cameron on Fox News, which now claims the Democrats have 218 votes for passage. We\u2019re not convinced yet.\nUpdate 3-20, 2:05 PM (from MacAoidh): The Rules Committee is now in recess, because Obama is about to hold a pep rally with the House Democrat Caucus, so that gives us time to show you the highlight from earlier today \u2013 which was Paul Ryan\u2019s presentation to the committee on the numbers. Every time this guy shows up to talk about numbers, the Democrats have got to hate it:\nUpdate 3-20, 1:50 PM (from MacAoidh): The Post story is now up, and it says, quoting Democrat Rep. Chris Van Hollen,\u00a0there will be three votes tomorrow\u2026\n\u2026the House would take three votes Sunday: first, on a resolution that will set the terms of debate; second, on a package of amendments to the Senate bill that have been demanded by House members; and third, on the Senate bill itself.\nVan Hollen is also quoted as saying that the \u201cdeem and pass\u201d controversy arises from a \u201ccampaign of misinformation.\u201d Chew on that for a while.\nHere\u2019s the question if all this is true: why is it that the President couldn\u2019t go to Australia and Indonesia? If the House was always going to take a vote on the Senate bill, then send a package of amendments to the Senate for reconciliation, this thing still has lots of time left in it beyond tomorrow.\nThe\u00a0conclusion one can\u2019t help but\u00a0reach is that\u00a0Obama and his people are determined to sign that Senate bill as soon as it passes the House. What would the consequences be then?\nUpdate 3-20, 1:30 PM (from MacAoidh): The Washington Post is now running a news alert saying that \u201cdeem and pass\u201d is being dropped. No explanation of what that means or where they got it; either they\u2019ve got confirmation that Waxman speaks for Pelosi or if they\u2019re just\u00a0working off what Waxman said \u2013 which may have just been him popping off. If it\u2019s the former, obviously one of two things is going on \u2013 Pelosi might think she\u2019s siphoned off a couple of Stupak\u2019s group and now\u00a0has 216 votes to pass the Senate bill, or perhaps the leadership has looked at the constitutional problems \u201cdeem and pass\u201d would put on the table.\nOn C-SPAN2, they\u2019re talking about the Post alert in the Rules committee \u2013 David Dreier, the Republican ranking member, just asked about it, and it\u2019s apparently the case.\nUpdate 3-20, 12:55 PM (from MacAoidh): On C-SPAN2 right now is live coverage of the\u00a0 markup at the House\u00a0Rules Committee, and it\u2019s pretty interesting stuff. Irritating, sure. But interesting.\nMeanwhile, Michael Barone at the Washington Examiner goes through the FireDogLake numbers, and he concludes as Ryan has that without Stupak\u2019s 11 votes (it was 12, but it\u2019s 11 now) Pelosi just can\u2019t get to 216.\nUpdate 3-20, 12:40 PM (from MacAoidh): Also from York, in a piece he wrote for the Washington Examiner today on the Rules Committee hearing this morning, is evidence of mass confusion as to exactly what the House is going to be voting on. As noted below, Henry Waxman said at the hearing that \u201cWe\u2019re not going to \u2018deem\u2019 the bill passed. We\u2019re going to pass the Senate bill\u2026I would be against the idea of \u2018deeming\u2019 something \u2014 we either pass it or we don\u2019t.\u201d\nBut perhaps Waxman either doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about or doesn\u2019t mean what it sounds like he means. York continues:\nTo Republican ears, that sounded as if Waxman was speaking out in support of a direct vote on the Senate plan. \u201cI hope we\u2019re making news here,\u201d said Republican Rep. Joe Barton. If so, Barton added, \u201cPraise the Lord!\u201d Other Democrats jumped in to say that no, there would not be a direct vote on the Senate bill.\nBarton then asked whether there would be some period of time between House passage of the Senate bill and House passage of the HCR amendments. During that period of time, the president would sign the Senate HCR bill into law. For the House to amend the HCR law, Barton said, it has to be law, which means the president has to have signed it. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, it ain\u2019t a law,\u201d Barton said.\nDemocratic Rep. Sander Levin jumped in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be amending the law,\u201d he claimed. Waxman added, \u201cWe change current law, and the current law will be the Senate bill once it\u2019s voted on in the House.\u201d\nBut it won\u2019t be law until the president signs it. Obviously, Democrats are performing such strange contortions because many of their members are scared of voting for a bill that will likely mean defeat for them in November. But their attempts to avoid responsibility have created some very basic problems.\nUpdate 3-20, 12:25 PM (from MacAoidh): Byron York tweets that if it\u2019s a \u201cdeem and pass\u201d vote, Cardozo (one of the two California Democrats who have been supposedly bought off with water for the San Fernando Valley) won\u2019t vote in favor.\nUpdate 3-20, 11:40 AM (from MacAoidh): The Corner just reported that Pelosi has said there will be \u201cno separate votes\u201d on the bill, which would more or less confirm that the Stupak deal is dead. It also just reported that Driehaus and Dahlkemper, who are two of Stupak\u2019s 12, are in Pelosi\u2019s office right now.\nUpdate 3-20, 11:30 AM (from MacAoidh): Here\u2019s a live stream of the tea party rally outside of the Capitol.\nUpdate 3-20, 11:20 AM (from MacAoidh): This one isn\u2019t a big surprise, but it\u2019s a lesson for the GOP \u2013 Bill Owens is voting yes . Owens is the Rep from NY-23 in case you forgot; he barely beat Doug Hoffman and promptly voted for Obamacare the first time it came through the House.\nUpdate 3-20, 11:15 AM (from MacAoidh): Meanwhile away from the Beltway, somebody did to Louise Slaughter\u2019s office window what her Rules Committee did to the Constitution.\nUpdate 3-20, 11:00 AM (from MacAoidh): From The Corner on NRO , comes this story out of the contentious House Rules Committee hearing:\nA rough and rowdy Rules Committee hearing just ended, but not before it had another great moment. Challenged by Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (D., Fla.) over Deem-and-Pass, Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) responded, with not a little dissimulation: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to deem the Senate bill passed.We\u2019re going to pass the Senate bill. We\u2019re going to pass it by a vote in the House.\u201d (Editor\u2019s Note: No, they won\u2019t.)\nRep. Joe Barton (R., Texas) responded. \u201cWe\u2019re making news here. . . Praise the Lord!\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 10:50 AM (from MacAoidh): A tweet from Fox News now says Baron Hill is voting \u201cyes.\u201d He was considered to be a likely switch to \u201cno,\u201d having voted for the original House Bill.\nUpdate 3-20, 10:42 AM (from MacAoidh): TheHill.com reports that Stupak has cancelled his press conference today, which would indicate that the deal is dead. Pelosi couldn\u2019t make it work. If this thing fails, it will be interesting to see who eventually gets the blame \u2013 the pro-choice Democrats, for holding up Obamacare because of a need for federal funding of abortion, or the pro-life Democrats for \u201cturning coat\u201d and joining with the Republicans.\nMeanwhile, a Stupak spokeswoman told Fox News\u2019 Neil Cavuto that \u201cnegotiations are ongoing.\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 9:50 AM: Greta van Susteren gets word that there will be no deal and hears that Stupak\u2019s press conference may be canceled.\nUpdate 3-20, 9:43 AM: On the amendments issue, my understanding is that amendments aren\u2019t allowed under reconciliation rules.\u00a0 So all of them are either for delay, or to make a point so that those voting yes can campaign saying, \u201cWell, I know that the bill was bad, but I offered this amendment, see\u2026\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 9:30 AM: Some people have been worried that Stupak may cave; I feel sure that he won\u2019t.\u00a0 For Stupak, there is something larger on the line than Obamacare \u2014 the future of pro-life Democrats.\u00a0 If he caves, or if he settles for something that turns out to be\u00a0a \u201cprotest vote,\u201d then the pro-life movement will never trust anyone again who claims to be a pro-life Democrat.\u00a0 What\u2019s more, the Democratic leadership will never regard their convictions with any value.\u00a0 On the other hand, if the Stupak gang holds, we have a watershed moment in American politics.\u00a0 Whether he forces a Pelosi deal, or whether Obamacare goes down in defeat, pro-lifers will have a place of regard and respect in the Democratic Party.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the pro-choice crowd is upset \u2014 they know that many people will blame them for the failure of Obamacare to pass, because they essentially insisted on public funding of abortion.\nUpdate 3-20, 9:10 AM (from MacAoidh): Ed Morrissey at HotAir has a summary of the 91 amendments\u00a0submitted to\u00a0the House Rules Committee in advance of tomorrow\u2019s vote, broken down alphabetically by author. Some of these are quite creative. Most of them are by Republicans seeking to blow up the bill, and of course those won\u2019t pass \u2013 Democrats on the committee voting against them will be forced to provide their fall opponents with some pretty juicy campaign fodder, though.\nAnd then you\u2019ve got the lefty amendments, like the one from well-known kook Alan Grayson which would allow folks to buy in to Medicare at cost\u2026\nUpdate 3-20, 8:55 AM: As I predicted last night, prospects for a Stupak deal appear to be collapsing .\u00a0 I\u2019m putting the word \u201cdeath\u201d back in the thread title \u2014 shame on me for taking it out.\nUpdate 3-20, 8:00 AM: Stupak was right.\u00a0 Back on Wednesday, he told The Hill in an interview:\n\u201cThey\u2019ll call me the night before and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got to work this out. We don\u2019t have the votes,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen we get serious.\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 7:50 AM: On the Ellsworth situation, Freddoso is a smart guy, but if he had been reading this page he\u2019d know that he\u2019s wrong \u2014 Pelosi sacrificed Ellsworth in a failed attempt to \u201ckeep the momentum going\u201d to make people think that Obamacare would pass.\u00a0 His U.S. Senate campaign is basically over before its really even started, and she ran out of votes and (to avoid losing)\u00a0is now trying to make a deal with Stupak that she could have made days or weeks ago and given her plenty of votes to spare so Ellsworth could vote no.\u00a0 She destroyed his Senate campaign and his pro-life credibility and got nothing out of it.\nUpdate 3-20, 7:40 AM: Thanks for the assist, Scott.\u00a0 Please keep pitching in.\nSome people have been confused because Fox News has been reporting since the Kosmas flip that Pelosi has the votes.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how to express how dumb this is.\u00a0 She did not have the votes for a bill then, and she doesn\u2019t have the votes for a bill now.\u00a0 She can potentially allow changes to the bill to get the Stupak group to vote yes and win, but such changes might cost her more votes than she gets.\u00a0 It was always clear that she would have the votes if she could successfully make a deal with Stupak.\u00a0 She is also still trying to \u201cfix\u201d the bill to satisfy DeFazio and the many silent members that he says will vote \u201cno\u201d with him if the regional Medicare disparity isn\u2019t changed the way they want.\nUpdate 3-20, 12:10 PM (from MacAoidh): One more thing before we hit this again in the morning \u2013 the Washington Examiner\u2019s Beltway Confidential blog\u00a0picks up\u00a0on the Brad Ellsworth situation with\u00a0a piece\u00a0about the political cost Ellsworth is\u00a0facing for having switched his vote to \u201cyes.\u201d Specifically, Ellsworth\u2019s likely Republican opponent in the Indiana Senate race, Dan Coats, put out a scathing rebuke of Ellsworth\u2019s \u201cyea,\u201d complete with a letter from Gov. Mitch Daniels outlining all the terrible effects the bill will have on\u00a0the Hoosier state.\nBeltway Confidential\u2019s David Freddoso comes to the conclusion that this is going to destroy any chance Ellsworth would have of winning that\u00a0Senate race, and then offers this analysis:\nIf Ellsworth is being pushed into voting for this, you can bet that Speaker Pelosi has no votes to spare. But by the same token, you wouldn\u2019t be hearing him commit in public if she didn\u2019t have the votes.\nUpdate 3-19, 11:51 PM (from MacAoidh): According to POLITICO , Obama will address the House Democratic Caucus at the Capitol at 3 PM Eastern time tomorrow. Harry Reid will be there as well. That\u2019s going to make for an interesting crowd-control situation, as the Tea Party Patriots, Americans For Tax\u00a0Reform\u00a0and FreedomWorks, among others, have a sizable rally planned for noon at the Capitol\u2019s West Lawn, with Steve King, Michele Bachmann and actor Jon Voigt set to speak. Does anybody worry that things might get a little dicey?\nUpdate 3-19, 11:30 PM: One last one before I turn out the lights: Allahpundit over at Hot Air has a lot of speculation on the proposed Stupak deal, but like me, he says we\u2019ll ultimately find out tomorrow.\nUpdate 3-19, 11:15 PM: Tony Perkins and Steny Hoyer , two men with very little in common, both\u00a0say that\u00a0Stupak\u2019s deal won\u2019t work.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see tomorrow.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to bed.\nUpdate 3-19, 10:50 PM: I was going to update my complete vote count tonight, but I\u2019ve decided that would be a waste of time.\u00a0 It is clear that Obamacare will fail if a Pelosi-Stupak deal does not successfully take place.\u00a0 What is not clear is whether such a purported deal can succeed, either technically, or within the Democratic caucus.\nWhat I still find astonishing is the timing.\u00a0 Anyone who actually looked at the individual votes and counted them could see that the votes to pass Obamacare simply were not there.\u00a0 Incredibly, no one else did this \u2014 least of all Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0 The damage that she has done to her own caucus is substantial, and she could lose the Speaker\u2019s post over this.\u00a0 What was the point, for example,\u00a0of forcing Rep. Ellsworth to seriously damage his U.S. Senate campaign earlier today by forcing him to declare his support for the bill?\u00a0 If she were going to make a deal with Stupak, she could have let Ellsworth keep his pro-life credentials instead of exposing him as a fraud.\u00a0 I think a lot of Democratic members are going to be very, very angry with her for her incompetent handling of this situation, no matter whether Obamacare ends up passing or not.\u00a0 This is going to have lasting consequences for congressional Democrats.\nUpdate 3-19, 10:30 PM: I\u2019m stunned.\u00a0 There is a deal.\u00a0 Pelosi has sold out to Stupak.\u00a0 He will get his vote, at least if Pelosi gets her way.\u00a0 In what is now an incredible irony, conservatives\u2019 hopes of killing Obamacare reside in the strength of the pro-choice caucus, which supposedly had 41 members who would vote no on Obamacare if Stupak got his way. Firedoglake has all the details \u2014 just go there and read it.\nUpdate 3-19, 9:40 PM: Firedoglake finally gets it :\u00a0 there is no path to passage of health care reform without some kind of abortion deal.\u00a0 David Dayen, writing there, thinks that there will be a deal, because he sees passage as inevitable.\u00a0 Clearly, I don\u2019t.\u00a0 I see a bunch of people who know that this is extremely unpopular and would love to have a good reason to scuttle the leadership\u2019s plans.\u00a0 Once it becomes clear to everyone else that the bill won\u2019t pass, they will all start demanding stuff like DeFazio \u201cor I won\u2019t vote for the bill.\u201d\u00a0 Then it will die without a vote, as I predicted back on Monday.\nUpdate 3-19, 9:35 PM: I\u2019m not bothering with the links, but Berkley, Kilroy, and Tonko all confirmed today that they would vote yes.\u00a0 I was already counting them all as yes.\u00a0 The whip count at The Hill is hopelessly behind and is pretty useless now.\nUpdate 3-19, 9:28 PM: Just to compound Pelosi\u2019s difficulties, another Democrat is saying that he\u2019s undecided because the bill doesn\u2019t fund enough abortions.\u00a0 He won\u2019t actually vote against the bill, of course, but these constant brush fires that Pelosi has to put out just compound her difficulties.\nUpdate 3-19, 9:25 PM: Thanks to commenter Dave, I learned that Teague has confirmed that he\u2019s a no .\u00a0 That\u2019s how we had him, but other counts like Firedoglake had him as undecided.\nUpdate 3-19 8:50 PM: It makes you wonder. These guys are obviously very slow readers .\u00a0 It\u2019s been a whole day and they haven\u2019t been able to read 150 pages.\nUpdate 3-19, 8:45 PM: Since Solomon Ortiz has a press conference scheduled for tomorrow, I\u2019m taking him off my undecided list and calling him a yes vote.\u00a0 It had been speculated that he was part of Stupak\u2019s group, but if he were, he\u2019d simply be going to the Stupak group press conference.\nUpdate 3-19, 8:35 PM: McNerney is leaning yes .\u00a0 I\u2019ll take him off my undecided list.\u00a0 I had hopes for him based on his vote yesterday against \u201cdeem and pass.\u201d\nUpdate 3-19, 8:25 PM: More on Stupak\u2019s proposal and how it would work (and why it won\u2019t).\nUpdate 3-19, 7:52 PM: Whoa. Rep. DeFazio is dead serious about voting no , bragging about voting no on the stimulus and cap and trade when his demands weren\u2019t met.\u00a0 And since I don\u2019t think that Pelosi has a good way to \u201cfix\u201d Medicare reimbursement at this stage of the game, I\u2019m going to count him as voting no.\u00a0 The \u201cno\u201d side now has 217 votes.\nUpdate 3-19, 7:40 PM: CNN is reporting that there is no deal, which is what I thought and continue to think.\u00a0 This is theater and butt-covering.\nAnti-abortion Democrat Bart Stupak of Michigan is asking for a vote on his language restricting taxpayer funding for abortion, and a group of female abortion rights Democrats came out of an emergency meeting in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office Friday evening visibly angry about the prospect.\nRep. Diana Degette, D-Colorado, told reporters a vote on Stupak\u2019s measure was a \u201cnon starter\u201d and said \u201csomewhere between 40 and 55\u2033 abortion rights Democrats would bolt from the bill.\n\u201cWe are holding firm this time,\u201d she insisted. \u201cIf Mr. Stupak and a few members along with the Republicans decide to use this to take health care down, that loss of health care will be in their hands.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how seriously Democratic leaders are considering allowing a vote on Stupak\u2019s abortion language, or in what form.\nBut Stupak told CNN he is in discussions with Pelosi.\n\u201cWe had a good discussion with the speaker on the floor,\u201d said Stupak. \u201cBut there was no agreement and there\u2019s no agreement until we see it in writing and we get a chance to massage it.\u201d\nUpdate 3-19, 7:30 PM: OK, where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire: reporter Molly Hooper of The Hill tweets :\nStupak told me Dem leaders \u201cdon\u2019t have the votes, or they wouldn\u2019t be talking to me.\u201d He holds a presser on Sat at 11am and hopes he\u2019ll have an agreement to announce. Leaving the Capitol, he told me \u201cthere\u2019s a proposal out there but nothing yet and we want to see it in writing and massage it,\u201d which is what he told the Speaker during the 10 min pow wow.\u00a0 Rep. Becerra confirms that there are \u201canimated discussions\u201d going on over the abortion language with both sides.\nI guess I have to take \u201cDeath\u201d out of the title of the post\u00a0now.\nUpdate 3-19, 7:25 PM: Rep. Mitchell will vote yes .\u00a0 He was an undecided vote that it would have been nice to have.\nUpdate 3-19, 7:20 PM: On the other hand, pro-choice Rep. Diana DeGette said, as she left Pelosi\u2019s office ,\u00a0\u201dWe\u2019re not happy.\u201d\u00a0 So maybe there is a Stupak deal.\nUpdate 3-19, 7:10 PM: Stupak reportedly met with Pelosi tonight.\u00a0 I still don\u2019t think there\u2019s a deal \u2014 it\u2019s just too impractical.\u00a0 What I think is happening is that both of them want to be able to say that they tried their hardest to make a deal.\u00a0 Both of them need to be able to blame the other\u2019s stubborness, because Stupak\u2019s group will be unpopular in their own party, and Pelosi wants to get as little of the blame as possible.\nUpdate 3-19, 6:45 PM: Stupak\u2019s press conference \u201cwith other pro-life Democrats\u201d will be at 10:00 AM tomorrow.\u00a0 Is it to announce a deal?\u00a0 Stupak has always said that he would not accept a promise of future action, so I\u2019m skeptical, but we\u2019ll see.\nUpdate 3-19, 6:35 PM: Rep. Barrow will\u00a0vote no. I had considered him a likely target for Pelosi and had him as undecided.\u00a0 That puts my own \u201cno\u201d count back to 216.\u00a0 The only way this bill will pass is if Pelosi can get a deal on abortion.\nUpdate 3-19, 6:30 PM: Eric Cantor says , \u201cThere\u2019s no way they can pass this bill.\u201d\nUpdate 3-19, 6:18 PM: People always give Larry Sabato too much credit.\u00a0 He tweets: \u201cThis will be a spectacular weekend as spring is sprung. Don\u2019t waste it watching media counts on health care. It\u2019s over. Bill will pass House.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019ll see who\u2019s right soon enough, Larry.\nUpdate 3-19, 6:10 PM: Firedoglake , which is a very liberal blog, is depressed about their prospects.\u00a0 David Dayen is doing a good job, but he\u2019s completely ignoring McNerney and Schrader, and should have Space and Teague as \u201cno\u201d votes instead of undecided, so the count is worse than he thinks:\nIf you look hard at the numbers, you can see why Pelosi is talking with Stupak and pro-choice women. With 214 No or lean No votes (including the Stupak bloc), Pelosi would have to prevent Dahlkemper and Kaptur from joining them. Then she would need all the other uncommitted votes, save one. That means she would have to get everyone who voted yes last time, plus Jim Matheson or Harry Teague (and all the lean Yes votes who went No last time, like Brian Baird and John Tanner). It\u2019s just not that plausible.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:53 PM: Pelosi has switched seven former no votes: Kucinich, Boyd, Gordon, Markey, Boccieri, Kosmas, and now Murphy.\u00a0 In the very beginning, I said that I thought she could switch seven.\u00a0 Now, though, I\u2019m still giving her Tanner and Baird.\u00a0 That would be nine.\u00a0 If we get Arcuri, Lynch, and Space, and if the Stupak group is seven, then we\u2019re still ahead.\u00a0 My gut is that Stupak\u2019s group is really nine.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:48 PM: \u201cPro-choice female Dems are shuttling in and out of Pelosi\u2019s office and they won\u2019t say why.\u201d Tweet from a reporter for The Hill.\u00a0 Perhaps a Stupak deal is in the works, after all, or at least being attempted.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:45 PM: Scott Murphy is, as expected, a yes .\u00a0 Pelosi still hasn\u2019t flipped a vote that we didn\u2019t expect.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:38 PM: By the way, Bart Stupak has a press conference scheduled for tomorrow morning.\u00a0 Maybe he\u2019ll have his group with him and we\u2019ll find out for sure about Carney, Dahlkemper, Berry, Ortiz, Kanjorski and Kaptur.\u00a0 We know that Stupak, Costello, Driehaus, Donnelly, Rahall, and Lipinski are in his group, but if his dozen turns out to be six, Pelosi has a chance.\u00a0 I\u2019m still counting Dahlkemper and Kaptur, but I don\u2019t mind trading them for the other names I mentioned.\u00a0 I just counted again and that would leave us at 215, so we really need the Stupak group to be nine or get one of the other undecided votes, since I don\u2019t feel that I can count DeFazio.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:18 PM: Here\u2019s a very good article explaining the Medicare reimbursement problem that DeFazio and others have with the bill.\u00a0 I\u2019m still not counting DeFazio as a no, because I still expect this to get worked out somehow, though that will be very difficult.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:15 PM: I still can\u2019t believe that the Democrats just gave up a U.S. Senate seat.\u00a0 Ellsworth was going to have a tough campaign for Evan Bayh\u2019s seat in Indiana, but now he has no chance.\u00a0 If the Democrats weren\u2019t frantically desperate, they would have protected him and let him vote no.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:08 PM: Firedoglake has a new count 200\u00a0YES to 209 NO, 207\u00a0YES to 212 NO with leaners included.\u00a0 It\u2019s a good count, but we know from multiple reports that Space is leaning no, and Rahall is a flat-out no.\u00a0 That count also has Kaptur as a \u201cleaning yes\u201d, but she has said that the\u00a0current abortion language is \u201cunacceptable,\u201d so that would take a lot of explaining.\u00a0 They have also ignored McNerney and Schrader, both whom I think are \u201cundecided,\u201d if not \u201cleaning no.\u201d\nUpdate 3-19, 4:40 PM: Maybe I\u2019m counting chickens before they are hatched: Ellsworth is a yes .\u00a0 Ellsworth is running for U.S. Senate in Indiana, so he\u2019s dead meat either way, but this is bad news, as I had him pegged solidly in the Stupak bloc and was counting on his vote.\u00a0 Perhaps I should now re-evaluate other members of the Stupak bloc.\nUpdate 3-19, 4:30 PM: Kosmas will switch from last time and vote yes .\u00a0 She was \u201cundecided\u201d in my book, so we still have 217.\nUpdate 3-19, 4:20 PM: Don\u2019t hyperventilate over this statement from Joseph Cao that he \u201chopes to reconsider\u201d his vote this weekend if Pelosi deals on abortion.\u00a0 Cao knows perfectly well that such a deal is impossible.\u00a0 The other Stupak members are saying similar things to protect them\u00a0with their Democratic base.\u00a0\u00a0In Cao\u2019s case, most of the electorate in his district is Democrat.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget that the 2008 vote in LA-2 was Obama 75%, McCain 23%.\nUpdate 3-19, 3:45 PM: \u201c There are a number of people who may be miscounted at this time ,\u201d DeFazio said of the \u201cyes\u201d vote count.\u00a0 This is the kind of thing that can happen when you are desperately changing a bill to get workable CBO numbers: you make one change accidentally\u00a0and critically damage a bill.\u00a0 Even if there is a way for Pelosi to \u201cfix\u201d this through parliamentary procedure, she can\u2019t send the bill back to the CBO now.\u00a0 Under reconciliation rules, this bill must reduce the deficit from the Senate bill.\u00a0 If she adds back in money now\u00a0to fix the regional Medicare disbursement, the bill will probably cost too much to be considered under reconciliation rules.\u00a0 I thought the bill would fail anyway, but this has got to be the nail in the coffin.\nUpdate 3-19, 3:30 PM: Read DeFazio\u2019s statement about why he plans to vote no.\u00a0 That gives the \u201cno\u201d side a solid 217 votes, enough to kill the bill with one to spare.\u00a0 There may be a way for Pelosi to \u201cfix\u201d this for DeFazio, though.\nUpdate 3-19, 3:25 PM: Altmire will vote no! That should just about do it, folks.\u00a0 And Boyd switches to yes , but readers of this space already knew that was likely.\u00a0 Baird and Scott Murphy are her likely next victims.\nUpdate 3-19, 2:50 PM: Cuellar was a longshot, but he sounds like a yes .\nUpdate 3-19, 2:38 PM: John McCormack in The Weekly Standard is as optimistic as I am.\u00a0 I also think that Stupak has the same nine that he does (though I have some concern about Berry).\u00a0 Even if it ends up being eight, those and Arcuri and Lynch mean that Pelosi would have to flip ten to win, and I just can\u2019t see it.\nUpdate 3-19, 2:30 PM: Perriello says that he\u2019s a yes \u2026 maybe .\u00a0 He\u2019ll vote for the bill if he gets written assurances from 50 senators that the parts he doesn\u2019t like will be taken out.\u00a0 Says that he doesn\u2019t think the bill will fund abortions.\u00a0 This one is unfortunate, as I thought he would be with us after voting against \u201cdeem and pass\u201d yesterday.\u00a0 That puts us at 214 solid.\nUpdate 3-19, 2:15 PM: Paul Ryan says that\u2019s it\u2019s 50-50 .\u00a0 The problem is that it\u2019s hard for the House GOP to really know what\u2019s going on, as all the discussion is on the Democratic side.\nUpdate 3-19, 2:05 PM: Holy Cow. This is insane .\u00a0 Politico has obtained a document (they have pulled the story until they can verify its origins), that supposedly promises that the \u201cDoc fix\u201d will come later on \u2026 but don\u2019t talk about it now because it\u2019ll hurt the bill.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see if the document is real.\u00a0 If so, she\u2019ll lose every Blue Dog vote.\nUpdate 3-19, 1:45 PM: Dick Morris is right (thanks for the tip, Scott) that Pelosi is on a \u201csuicide run.\u201d\u00a0 Why is she pushing for a vote on Sunday when it\u2019s still likely she\u2019ll lose?\u00a0 Because Democrats have no choice.\u00a0 The longer this drags out, the worse it is for them, because eventually the public will wear down her members into voting no.\u00a0 She can\u2019t let them go home for Easter or it\u2019s over.\u00a0 In fact, if they don\u2019t vote on Sunday, everyone will see that the emperor has no clothes, so she has to push forward and hope for a miracle.\nUpdate 3-19, 1:23 PM: Pelosi shoots down any Stupak deal .\u00a0 As I said, it was all about Stupak & Co. being able to say that they did everything they could \u2014 and also a way for them to stay undecided as long as possible.\u00a0 Now, we\u2019ll start to find out just how many and how strong the Stupak group is.\nUpdate 3-19, 1:00 PM: What is amazing to me is how bad of a job other media outlets are doing or reporting on\u00a0the vote count. Take this brand new article from The Hill , a publication that a lot of people pay good money for.\u00a0 They list Shea-Porter and Kagen as \u201cleaning yes\u201d when they have in fact publicly said that they will vote yes.\u00a0 They also have Zack Space as \u201cleaning yes\u201d when the Washington Post reported this morning that he in fact has informed House leadership that he plans to vote no.\nUpdate 3-19, 12:45 PM: Accoring to the same Huff Post link below, DeFazio is not alone in demanding that his state get its fair share in Medicare disbursements.\u00a0 Pelosi\u2019s team is scrambling.\u00a0 If they start losing otherwise liberal members over this, they have no hope.\u00a0 The Democrats will get this worked out, but this just indicates the disorganized mess that the their effort has turned into.\nUpdate 3-19, 11:44 AM: According to the Huffington Post , Dina Titus is a yes \u2014 she was previously undecided.\u00a0 Also, DeFazio has been a \u201cyes,\u201d but he now says that he\u2019s a no unless the bill is changed so that Oregon gets its fair share of Medicare disbursements.\u00a0 Pelosi says that she\u2019s working on it (I thought that special deals were out?\u00a0 Ha.)\nUpdate 3-19, 11:12 AM: By the way, the talk of a Stupak deal is entirely one-sided.\u00a0 Stupak and his gang are talking about a deal because they want Democratic primary voters (and potential primary challengers) to know that they really, really wanted to vote for comprehensive health care reform that would guarantee coverage to millions of uninsured, etc.\u00a0 The Democratic leadership\nUpdate 3-19, 11:03 AM: Another story about a possible deal with Stupak .\u00a0 Again, I don\u2019t really think a deal is possible, because the Democratic House women will revolt and the Senate won\u2019t go along.\u00a0 No, the big news in the story is Rahall saying that he is a solid member of the Stupak bloc and will vote \u201cno\u201d unless the abortion language is changed.\u00a0 That\u2019s awesome!\u00a0 It still leaves us at 215, though, since I just took Carney out.\nUpdate 3-19, 10:55 AM: Not good news: I think I need to take Chris Carney out of my \u201cno\u201d count .\u00a0 His committment to Stupak doesn\u2019t seem secure.\u00a0 He goes back into the \u201cundecided\u201d list.\nUpdate 3-19, 10:50 AM: This is great news: The Washington Post is reporting that Zach Space has told House leaders that he is leaning \u201cno.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 I had him as leaning \u201cyes\u201d and hadn\u2019t thought this likely.\u00a0 If he were truly a \u201cno\u201d, that would put opponents at 216, but I\u2019ll wait for more confirmation.\nUpdate 3-19, 10:40 AM: Former\u00a0Rep. Tom Delay, known as \u201cThe Hammer\u201d for his ability to round up votes, is pessimistic about our chances of defeating the bill.\u00a0 He says that Kaptur is just too liberal to vote \u201cno,\u201d no matter the her promises to Stupak, and that Costello \u201ccan be bought.\u201d\nUpdate 3-19, 10:35 AM: As I expected, Boccieri will vote switch and vote yes .\nUpdate 3-19, 9:37 AM: I\u2019m now ready to officially add Lynch to the \u201cno\u201d column .\u00a0 I\u2019ve hesitated because he\u2019s generally pretty liberal, but he met with the President yesterday, and the visit didn\u2019t sway him.\u00a0 That puts my \u201cno\u201d count at a pretty solid 215, with 14 pretty good prospects.\u00a0 Pelosi would need all 14, plus all her other wavering votes.\nUpdate 3-19, 9:15 AM: Updated most-likely-to-switch lists from Politico are out.\u00a0 These are dead on, in my opinion.\nNO-TO-YES: 1) Kucinich, 2) Gordon, 3) Markey, 4) Baird, 5) Boccieri, 6) Boyd, 7) Scott Murphy, 8 ) Kosmas, 9) Altmire, 10) Kissell, 11) Tanner, 12) Teague, 13) Matheson, 14) McMahon, 15) Barrow, 16) Chandler\nYES-TO-NO: 1) Stupak, 2) Arcuri, 3) Lynch, 4) Donnelly, 5) Lipinski, 6) Costello, 7) Driehaus, 8 ) Dahlkemper, 9) Ellsworth, 10) Kaptur, 11) Carney, 12) Berry, 13) Pomeroy, 14) Space, 15) Cuellar, 16) Mollohan, 17) Mitchell, 18) Titus, 19) Foster, 20) Bean, 21) Hill, 22) Owens, 23) Kanjorski, 24) Rahall, 25) Etheridge, 26) Ortiz\nI\u2019m very confident that Pelosi will get 4-7 on her target list, and I have some concerns about 8-11, and I would have had had Barrow ranked higher than 15, though maybe they know something I don\u2019t.\u00a0 She isn\u2019t getting Teague, Chandler, or McMahon though.\u00a0 On the other hand, Stupak has rallied his troops and I think that 1-11 are very solid \u201cno\u201d votes at this point (all except Arcuri and Lynch are his).\u00a0 I also feel very good about our chances with 13-20, Kanjorski (student loan provision would eliminate jobs at a Sallie Mae processing center in his district), and McNerny and Schrader (who have both kept a low enough profile to stay off these lists).\nUpdate 3-19, 9:00 AM: Democrats are bragging that they are within five votes; they are lying.\u00a0 They have lied throughout this process to create the sense of inevitability of the bill \u2014 remember Rep. Larson saying on Monday that they had the votes then?\u00a0 Pelosi is still at least 15 votes away and probably 20.\nUpdate 3-19, 8:45 AM: Rep. Boccieri has a 9:40 CT\u00a0press conference to announce his vote.\u00a0 He\u2019s most likely switching his vote from \u201cno\u201d to \u201cyes.\u201d\u00a0 He is a must get and an expected get for Pelosi, which is why I didn\u2019t even list him in my \u201cundecided\u201d count below.\u00a0 For the record, I also expect her to get Boyd, Tanner, Baird, and Scott Murphy to switch from \u201cno\u201d to \u201cyes.\u201d\u00a0 Those, plus Kucinich, Gordon, and Markey, would still be counterbalanced by a Stupak group of\u00a0eight and Arcuri.\u00a0 If she flips any \u201cno\u201d votes other than those eight, then it gets interesting.\nUpdate 3-19, 8:30 AM: There is new talk of a deal with Stupak on abortion.\u00a0 In my opinion, this is the only way that Obamacare can win, but it will come at a heavy cost to Democrats.\u00a0 I think he might face more liberal defections than he gets back with Stupak, as the pro-choice groups only went along with Stupak the first time because they were promised it would be cut out in conference committee.\u00a0 And, as Stupak just said on ABC, the deal has to include the Senate \u2014 a tall order.\nUpdate 3-19, 6:11 AM: After reading this , I\u2019m going to move Lynch back to \u201cleaning no,\u201d but I\u2019m not counting on his vote.\u00a0 He\u2019s a pretty liberal guy, though his district went 55% for Scott Brown.\nUpdate 3-18, 11:15 PM: Joseph Cao reviewed the Senate language again, per the President\u2019s request, and found that it still funded abortions.\u00a0 So he\u2019s still a no.\nUpdate 3-18, 10:45 PM: I\u2019m going to ignore Bobby Rush\u2019s silliness .\u00a0 There is simply\u00a0no way that he will vote against Obamacare.\u00a0 The only good thing about this is that it is one more distraction for Pelosi & Co.\nUpdate 3-18, 8:15 PM: I\u2019ve been working and haven\u2019t had time to do a proper analysis of today\u2019s the \u201cdeem and pass\u201d rule challenge.\u00a0 Fortunately, Michael Barone was on the case .\u00a0 Before I get into the individual members, I think that the vote was very revealing \u2014 it showed Pelosi just how far behind she is.\u00a0\u00a0By exposing her problems, though,\u00a0she knows who her problems are, which may help her \u201cfix\u201d them (which is not good for our side).\nNow, voting for \u201cdeem and pass\u201d does not necessarily indicate a vote for the main bill \u2014 the Stupak group, for instance, will vote against the main bill because of abortion, not deem and pass.\u00a0 Likewise, it\u2019s possible (though much less likely)\u00a0that a member could vote against deem and pass and still think that Obamacare is so wonderful that they vote for the main bill despite disapproving of the procedure.\nWith those caveats in place, Barone starts off:\nOf the 28 Democrats voting no, 16 voted against the House health care bill last November: Bright (AL 2), Davis (AL 7), Kosmas (FL 24), Minnick (ID 1), Melancon (LA 3), Kratovil (MD 1), Childers (MS 1), Taylor (MS 4), Adler (NJ 3), Teague (NM 2), McIntyre (NC 7), Shuler (NC 11), Boren (OK 2), Holden (PA 17), Herseth Sandlin (SD 1), Nye (VA 2).\nThat firms up Nye from a \u201clean no\u201d to\u00a0a \u201cno\u201d in my book, and moves Kosmas back to a \u201clean no\u201d from a \u201clean yes\u201d.\u00a0 She has been a prime target for a flip, and this was a strong vote against the leadership.\u00a0 Some lists also had Teague and Childers\u00a0as possible Dem targets, and this should remove them as well.\nOf the Democrats who voted \u201cyes\u201d last year but voted against \u201cdeem and pass,\u201d Stupak, Lipinski, Costello, and Carney were already known to be opposing the bill because of abortion.\u00a0 Dahlkemper\u2019s vote today confirms her as a member of the Stupak bloc and a \u201cno\u201d vote on the bill (I previously had her as undecided).\u00a0 Of the others, McNerny and Perriello were undecided and this puts them into the \u201clean no\u201d category.\u00a0 I had pegged Giffords as voting \u201cyes,\u201d so I\u2019ll move her back to undecided along with Mitchell, and Cooper.\u00a0 Michaud isn\u2019t on my radar screen, so I\u2019m leave that vote as a \u201cyes\u201d until I get more information.\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m very perplexed that Lynch and Altmire voted for \u201cdeem and pass,\u201d as both of them have publicly blasted the procedure.\u00a0 I\u2019m now going to put both of them as \u201cundecided\u201d and take them out of the \u201cno\u201d column.\nI\u2019m really only counting \u201cno\u201d votes at this point, because most of the undecided members will vote yes.\u00a0 I\u2019m confident in 214 votes right now, and there are 8 more that I think are at least 50-50, with some others that are still good possibilities.\u00a0 These are the Democrats in my count as voting no:\nAdler\n"}, {"score": 1034.0763, "uuid": "1dd5e8ed-47d9-5563-a999-c3d3bf6de6ce", "index": "cw12",

We will discuss our litigation strategy about the healthcare bill. I will update you on facebook after the conference call.\nSo far as we can tell, and readers are welcome to educate us otherwise if you\u2019ve got further information, Texas doesn\u2019t have a bill in the works to fight Obamacare specifically \u2013 so the basis of the Lone Star State\u2019s challenge might be a little different than the other 37 or so states. We\u2019ll see what Abbott comes back with.\nUpdate 3-21, 6:55 PM (from MacAoidh): We\u2019re down to House Republicans\u2019 Last Stand At The Alamo, and as last stands go this one isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s a Motion To Recommit, and it dredges the Stupak clan back into play \u2013 possibly.\nFrom TheHill.com \u2026\nDemocrats are worried about holding their members together on a GOP motion that could kill the healthcare bill.\nRep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) said House leaders are specifically concerned about a Republican motion to recommit that would contain only language on abortion that Stupak originally had wanted to include in the Senate bill.\nThe concern is based on the fear of GOP attack ads painting Democrats who vote against a motion to recommit that includes Stupak\u2019s favored language on abortion as \u201cflip-floppers\u201d on the issue.\nSixty-eight Democrats voted for Stupak\u2019s language in a November vote. They could be portrayed as flipping if they now voted against it.\n\u201cThey are concerned about it,\u201d Stupak said after his Sunday press conference.\nThe effect of this, if it passes, would be to kill the thing. Passing it would put the pro-abortion Democrats in position to have to vote for a House bill with Stupak language in it, and they won\u2019t go for it. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi likely won\u2019t even reintroduce it, particularly since a Stupak-laden House Bill going back to the Senate probably won\u2019t get it done.\nThe question is whether the Republicans would put anything else in the bill. As blogger Drew M. at Ace of Spades notes , there\u2019s no point in them doing that \u2013 Republican amendments make it a loser. But if it\u2019s just Stupak, it\u2019s actually possible given the numbers that 216 votes can be found for it.\nWorth a shot.\nUpdate 3-21, 5:20 PM (from MacAoidh): Now comes another card being played by the Republicans \u2013 they say the Reconciliation bill violates the 1974 Congressional Budget Act , Section 310(g) of which, they say, would make it out of order for the Senate to take up a bill which deals with dispensing of Social Security savings (the Reconciliation Bill says $29 billion\u00a0in increased revenues\u00a0for Social Security are coming) outside of Social Security. The GOP is asking for a meeting with the Senate Democrats and the Parliamentarian in an attempt to deal with the controversy, and nobody will take the meeting at present.\nUpdate 3-21, 4:45 PM (from MacAoidh): This one\u2019s going to be interesting: Stupak has an intriguing Republican challenger in Dan Benishek , who is a doctor and a conservative. Check out his facebook page , which apparently has picked up some pretty massive momentum in the last couple of hours. Benishek doesn\u2019t have a website up yet; he only announced his candidacy this week.\nUpdate 3-21, 3:10 PM (from MacAoidh): Stupak and his group have officially flipped, and he just confirmed that he\u2019s flipping for the Executive Order deal. So Pelosi and Obama win this round. The executive order will be signed AFTER the vote, which means his head is squarely in the lion\u2019s mouth.\nIf you\u2019re wondering about Stupak\u2019s commitment to the pro-life cause, you\u2019re not alone. Allahpundit at HotAir quotes POLITICO\u2019s piece confirming the deal :\nThe White House and anti-abortion Democrats have reached an agreement to defusethe controversy over abortion in the health reform bill \u2013 planning a series of steps that will secure the support of Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) and other Democrats to give party leaders the votes they need to pass reform, sources tell POLITICO.\nUnder the agreement, President Barack Obama would sign an executive order ensuring that no federal funding will go to pay for abortion under the health reform plans. In addition, Stupak will get to state his concerns about abortion funding in the bill during a colloquy on the House floor during the debate.\nAnd then, Stupak and several other Democratic hold-outs over abortion will sign on to the bill, the sources said\u2026\nRep. Alan Mollohan, who is one of the votes in question, told POLITICO that the language in the agreement has already been essentially cleared. Mollohan said it is only a matter of time for \u201cthe follow-through steps\u201d to be implemented.\n\u2026and then offers his own take, which we think has a lot of validity:\nSo he caved for a wafer-thin executive order and a little floor time to praise life? Geez. Cheap date, Bart.\nUpdate 3-21, 2:00 PM: Stupak just told repoters that there is still no deal and the negotiations are sometimes like \u201cone step forward, two steps back.\u201d\u00a0 Since he still has nine members (though some could certainly still cave at the last minute), The White House must make the deal if Obamacare is to pass.\u00a0 Even if Pelosi were to get the other five undecided votes, the Stupak nine would defeat the bill by three votes.\u00a0 Even though I, sadly,\u00a0still fully expect the deal to get done and for Obamacare to pass, I\u2019m pleased that the pro-life movement is holding this bill hostage and extracting major concessions from President Obama.\u00a0 A week ago, who would have thought that the drama over this vote would end with President Obama issuing a detailed\u00a0executive order prohibiting public funds from being used to pay for abortions?\nUpdate 3-21, 1:50 PM: Don\u2019t have time to link, but Foster and Baird are now yes votes and Lincoln Davis is a no.\u00a0 Since he now makes 209 confirmed no votes, Pelosi can\u2019t get to 216 without finalizing the details on Stupak, so they will have to do that.\nUpdate 3-21, 1:35 PM: Oh, what the heck \u2026 I\u00a0guess I can do one last update. Tanner is a NO .\u00a0 Just for the sake of counting, that puts the solid NO count at 208.\u00a0 And for what it\u2019s worth, Stupak has told CNN that he and the White House lawyers are still working out the last few final details and he isn\u2019t officially a YES vote yet, but that he expects to be very soon.\u00a0 In case you missed it earlier, Kaptur caved and broke off of the Stupak group \u2014 she just couldn\u2019t wait to say that she was for Obamacare.\u00a0 As I noted earlier in the week, Tom Delay had predicted that, saying that she\u2019s just too liberal to possibly vote NO.\nUpdate 3-21, 12:38 PM: Those of you who have followed this post for the last several days know that I was once extraordinarily confident that the vote on Obamacare would fail in the House.\u00a0 I was obviously very, very wrong.\u00a0 If any of you bet against Obamacare on Intrade after reading here, then I am extremely sorry \u2014 you\u2019ll know better than to believe me next time.\u00a0 I\u2019ll write a separate post this evening explaining why I was wrong, for those who are interested (and link to it from here).\u00a0 Curious as I am to see exactly how everyone votes, I won\u2019t be able to watch today\u2019s proceedings, as I have to work.\u00a0 As some of you may know, I own and run the Mathnasium learning center in Baton Rouge, and we\u2019re always extremely busy the week after report cards go home.\u00a0 Thanks for reading this past week.\nUpdate 3-21, 12:13 PM: According to MSNBC, Stupak has agreed to a deal and will vote yes.\u00a0 That\u2019s all she wrote, folks.\u00a0 Obamacare will pass.\nUpdate 3-21, 10:10 AM (from MacAoidh): I\u2019m working on a piece for the front page (I\u2019ll post a link here when it\u2019s done) which discusses reasons why the assumption of inevitability that Obamacare once enacted will continue to grow is false. As said many times elsewhere, this would be the first social legislation of major scale to be enacted without bipartisan support, and it\u2019s also the first time the majority which would enact such legislation would be likely to be turned out of office immediately thereafter. There are other reasons why this one is different, and I\u2019ll get into those, plus expand on the above, in the piece I\u2019m working on for later today.\nA few developments to report: first, TheHill.com reports that Bart Stupak is still negotiating with the White House on an executive order which would purportedly ban federal funding of abortions; this one will go down to the wire, but if Stupak ends up playing ball, moving his group into the \u201cyes\u201d column and dragging Obamacare over the finish line only to find himself double-crossed by the President and the House leadership \u2013 which is likely if not certain to happen \u2013 it could be the end of pro-life Democrats in American politics.\nSecond, former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin writes in the New York Times this morning that the real, accurate budget effect of Obamacare isn\u2019t $1.3 trillion in deficit reduction, as Obama claims, or $138 billion as the current CBO score would indicate, or $58 billion in red ink, as Paul Ryan says is the case once the \u201cdoctor fix\u201d is put in place, but $562 billion.\nYikes.\nAnd third, the latest count among the cable-news networks has Obamacare with 216 House supporters \u2013 maybe. Fox News counts it at 216-215, though their numbers have been shaky from the get-go, and CNN says it\u2019s razor-thin. Rep. John Larson, D-CT, who is the Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, is bragging that they have the votes. But Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, the House Deputy Whip, admitted to Fox News that it\u2019s not a \u201chard 216.\u201d\nUpdate 3-21, 8:20 AM: Politico has some guesses on how the final undecideds will break.\u00a0 If they are right, then Kaptur, Berry,\u00a0and Mollohan are the ones peeling off the Stupak group.\u00a0 They think Pelosi can convince Pomeroy to end his politcal career in North Dakota, and that she will get Tanner and Baird to vote yes.\u00a0 Those assumptions are not unreasonable.\u00a0 But they appear to already be counting Rahall\u2019s vote in their starting at 210 for Pelosi, which is puzzling, as he is also part of the Stupak group and has firmly pledged to vote no absent a deal on abortion.\u00a0 So, the deal narrows the Stupak group to six and Pelosi gets Pomeroy and she wins.\nUpdate 3-21, 7:43 AM: There isn\u2019t any news yet this morning, except I saw more confirmation from last night that some unnamed members of Stupak\u2019s group were agreeing to a deal on an executive order.\u00a0 There\u2019s certainly still hope that the deal could fall through, but, at this point, I finally have to shed my optimism.\u00a0 I can write that Pelosi still didn\u2019t have the votes last night, and I can write that I still expect to get Pomeroy, Davis, and Boucher, and that those plus six Stupak members would be the 216 we need to defeat the bill, but the reality is that the bill won\u2019t lose by one vote.\u00a0 Pelosi will simply hold the machines open and convince someone to \u201ctake one for the team\u201d and switch his vote.\u00a0 The reality is that, unless Stupak fights back and manages to keep eight or nine members of his group together (or we catch a couple of breaks like with Sanchez), that Pelosi will be able to flip votes on the floor and win.\nThe likelihood of Pelosi flipping a vote or two during the vote if necessary is why Rep. Gene Taylor (D-Miss) is basically advising members to vote no and run for your life .\nUpdate 3-20, 11:00 PM: This is it for tonight.\u00a0 From tomorrow\u2019s Washington Post :\nHouse leaders were working to secure their votes late Saturday with the promise of an executive order affirming President Obama \u2018s commitment to a longstanding ban on public abortion funding except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), a key antiabortion vote, said she thought the document would be insufficient to bring the entire group of about 10 antiabortion Democrats onboard.\nOf course, he doesn\u2019t need all of them.\nUpdate 3-20, 10:50 PM: Jane Hamsher makes a good argument for counting Sanchez as a NO.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to count her that way, since she hasn\u2019t said that she will vote no.\u00a0 Since the article in Roll Call said that House leadership weren\u2019t assured that she would return to DC for the vote (!), I should mention that an absence is as good as a NO vote.\u00a0 If the vote is 215-215, it fails.\nUpdate 3-20, 9:25 PM: While I was typing the post below, Schrader announced that he will vote yes.\nUpdate 3-20, 8:40 PM: Since we\u2019re unlikely to get more news tonight, I thought I would run down the numbers and possibilities.\u00a0 Republicans have 206 publicly committed votes.\u00a0 We need 216 to defeat the bill.\u00a0 There were ten members of the Stupak group:\nStupak\nCostello\nBerry\nObviously, if all of those held, that would be enough to defeat the bill, but the cryptic comment of Stupak that he had lost votes and\u00a0\u201dat least six\u201d will stand opposed is still puzzling.\u00a0 There are also still five uncommitted members who voted NO in November:\nBaird\nBoucher\nL. Davis\nPelosi likely has Baird and Tanner in her back pocket, especially Baird.\u00a0 Davis\u2019 situation I detailed below, Boucher represents an overwhelmingly Republican district and\u00a0said last week that he would vote against the bill if it had big cuts to Medicare (and it does), and Nye represents a Republican district and faces a strong challenge to re-election.\u00a0 I think that the three of them are likely to vote NO.\nFinally, we have the non-Stupak\u00a0ones who voted YES in November but that we would like to flip our way:\nOrtiz\nSchrader\nRon Klein\nSanchez is a new addition to my list.\u00a0 She\u2019s been a presumed YES vote, but it turns out that she didn\u2019t want to vote yes last time and was actually the final Dem to vote in favor.\u00a0 She said this week that \u201cthe Senate bill is a bad bill,\u201d and she is facing a serious challenge this fall. She spent today in Florida (yes, you read that correctly) \u2014 thus avoiding getting buttonholed by the House leadership, who now reportedly list her as a NO.\u00a0 I also see Schrader, Ortiz, Klein, and Kanjorski as possible votes our way\u00a0\u2013 they all have good reason to vote NO.\u00a0 And Pomeroy is a likely NO vote in my book.\nSo, I still see Nye, Boucher, Davis, and Pomeroy as likely for us.\u00a0 I also see another six as good possibilities.\u00a0 If we do get four votes from this group, then six from Stupak still wins it for us.\u00a0 And Pelosi still has a lot of other publicly uncommitted members, and we could still get one of those unexpectly, like we did with Lynch.\nUpdate 3-20, 8:00 PM: Since Stupak won\u2019t be part of the deliberations, I feel secure in my belief that this is an attempt to peel votes off Stupak, not to actually make a deal with him.\u00a0 One thing that isn\u2019t being discussed elsewhere is whether members of the Stupak group want there to be\u00a0a deal.\u00a0 I think that Stupak genuinely wanted to get his amendment passed and vote yes for Obamacare, but seven of the nine other members of his group represent districts where a NO vote (for any reason) would be popular and politically expedient.\u00a0 Supporting Stupak was a great way to keep the pressure off.\nSenior Dem staffer says abortion/executive order deliberations will take place tonight at the White House.\nStupak won\u2019t be there\u2026 Dem staffer says \u201cthis still isn\u2019t nailed down\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 7:40 PM: Zack Space wasn\u2019t \u201creleased\u201d to vote NO by Pelosi; he had been leaning NO for days.\u00a0 That\u2019s good news and confirms that Pelosi likely still doesn\u2019t have the votes locked up.\nUpdate 3-20, 7:35 PM: Rep. Capuano is a liberal who has finally decided to vote yes. Since I always had him that way, that doesn\u2019t change my count.\nUpdate 3-20, 7:30 PM: The Minority Leader\u2019s office is distributing the following comments about an Executive Order \u201cdeal\u201d:\nUS Conference of Catholic Bishops: \u201cNo regulation, policy letter from HRSA, or other executive action can withstand a statutory mandate, construed by federal courts applying a constitutional decision on abortion.\u201d\nNational Right to Life Committee: \u201cIf the [Senate] bill is signed into law, these statutory requirements and defects are not subject to correction or nullification by the chief executive or his appointees, whether by Executive Order, regulation, or otherwise.\u201d\nAmericans United for Life: \u201cThe proposal to address the problem of abortion funding in the health care bill through use of an Executive Order is a tacit acknowledgement that the bill as it stands is pro-abortion legislation \u2026 [I]t also does not succeed in application. An Executive Order cannot prevent insurance companies that pay for abortions from participating in the exchanges.\u00a0 Further, Executive Orders can be undone or modified as quickly as they are created.\u00a0 This is a blatant attempt to subvert democracy and should be quickly quashed.\u201d\nFamily Research Council warns against the promise of: \u201can Executive Order (EO) that would magically fix the fact that the Senate bill (H.R. 3590) would spend government funds to pay for elective abortions. Further, the Reconciliation bill will make matters worse by increasing funding for community health centers, which will bypass any abortion funding restrictions in appropriations bills because it is directly appropriated. Both taken together will fund abortion, regardless of any EO.\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 6:45 PM: Supposedly, Rep. Diana DeGette, the leader of the pro-choice caucus in the House, has signed off on the proposed Executive Order.\u00a0 If she\u2019s OK with it, then Stupak probably isn\u2019t, meaning that its design is to peel a few of his group off.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, we\u00a0have 206 NO votes that are absolutely rock solid.\u00a0 Of the eleven non-Stupak\u00a0undecided members, I think we get Nye, Boucher, Pomeroy, and Davis.\u00a0 If we could do that, we would still win with six votes from the Stupak group.\u00a0 Though I am no longer confidently predicting the defeat of the bill, it isn\u2019t over by a long shot.\nUpdate 3-20, 6:28 PM: One of the more curious situations is that of Rep. Lincoln Davis of Tennessee.\u00a0 He voted NO last time and represents a district that is 14 points more Republican than the country as a whole.\u00a0 He\u2019s not \u201cundecided;\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0has simply refused to give anyone any public indication of how he intends to vote.\u00a0 Is he refusing to say anything because he\u2019s pledged his vote to Pelosi and he doesn\u2019t want to have to hear it from his constituents, or is he refusing because he doesn\u2019t want union sit-ins staged in his office like the one that Rep. Altmire got after announcing that he would vote no?\u00a0 Because he voted no last time and because of the strong GOP tilt to his district, I would have to bet on the latter, but we\u2019ll see.\nUpdate 3-20, 6:17 PM: Will Pomeroy flip our way?\u00a0 North Dakota has a small population, so Rep. Earl Pomeroy represents the entire state.\u00a0 Now, North Dakota is about ten points more Republican than the country as a whole.\u00a0 A few hours ago, the North Dakota GOP\u00a0Convention selected State Rep. Rick Berg , the former majority\u00a0leader of the state house,\u00a0to run against Pomeroy.\u00a0 A Rasmussen poll last month showed Berg beating Pomeroy 46% to 40% , which was apparently a key factor in today\u2019s decision by the Convention.\u00a0 If Pomeroy votes yes, he is headed for certain defeat.\u00a0 As of a couple hours ago, Pomeroy was still telling reporters that he was \u201cundecided.\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 6:00 PM: I love this photo .\u00a0 It\u2019s Louisiana\u2019s own Steve Scalise, handing out copies of the U.S. Constitution on the Capitol steps.\nUpdate 3-20, 5:55 PM: One more thing to remember about the Stupak group:\u00a0 of the ten that I have left in the group, only Lipinski and Kaptur are in solidly Democratic districts.\u00a0 Stupak, Berry, Mollohan, Donnelly, Dahlkemper,\u00a0and Rahall all represent districts that lean Republican, and Driehaus\u2019 and Costello\u2019s districts lean Dem by 3 points or less.\u00a0 That means that, except for Lipinski and Kaptur, it\u2019s in their political best interest to vote against Obamacare regardless of its disposition of the abortion issue.\nUpdate 3-20, 5:40 PM: Those two no votes mean that Stupak could defeat the bill with seven, assuming that we don\u2019t get any more.\u00a0 But I still can\u2019t see Glenn Nye switching his vote to yes.\u00a0 If Nye votes no, then a Stupak group of six would be enough.\u00a0 On the other hand, if the President can craft an Executive Order that will satisfy Stupak, it\u2019s all over \u2014 always has been.\nUpdate 3-20, 5:36 PM: Jim Matheson is a NO. Giving his brother a nomination to the federal judiciary apparently did not sway his vote.\nUpdate 3-20, 5:08 PM: Zack Space is a NO. The question is, did Pelosi just give him permission to vote no because she\u2019s split the Stupak group and got enough votes?\u00a0 Space is the third confirmed yes-to-no flip outside of the Stupak group.\nUpdate 3-20, 5:00 PM: If you want to know a little more about the members believed in play, this article is a good place to start .\u00a0 Note that, since the article was written,\u00a0Carney and DeFazio have now committed for the bill.\nUpdate 3-20, 4:55 PM: I\u2019m still confused.\u00a0 I just re-read the article from The Hill that said that Stupak was down to six, and it still had Stupak speculating about a \u201cpossible\u201d executive order and what would be in it, so that couldn\u2019t explain how his eleven suddenly went down to \u201cat least six.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019ll find out eventually.\nUpdate 3-20, 4:43 PM: That\u2019s why the deal was always that Stupak and Stupak alone would negotiate and decide for the group.\u00a0 Something that splits the group is very bad \u2013\u00a0not just for Obamacare, but also for the pro-life movement.\u00a0 Pro-lifers needed this group of Democrats to stand together.\nUpdate 3-20, 4:33 PM: OK, this explains it: President Obama is issuing an Executive Order that will prohibit federal money from being used for abortions under this bill.\u00a0 What is likely happening is that the President has come up with something that\u2019s enough to satisfy some members of the Stupak group and get the bill over the line.\nUpdate 3-20, 4:20 PM: Something\u2019s fishy.\u00a0 Stupak didn\u2019t suddenly go from eleven members down to six.\u00a0 I think that quote was taken out of context somehow.\u00a0 As Firedoglake notes, the six mentioned in this article do not include Lipinski, Donnelly,\u00a0or Costello, some of the most outspoken members of the group.\u00a0\u00a0 If some are flipping, it would be Rahall, Kaptur, or Dahlkemper \u2014 and yet they are mentioned in the article as still being with Stupak.\nUpdate 3-20, 4:10 PM: If Stupak only has six, that means we would have to win more of the undecided members than Pelosi.\u00a0 That won\u2019t happen.\u00a0 On the other hand, Eric Cantor tells NRO: \u201cWe\u2019re still fighting and it\u2019s still very fluid.\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 4:00 PM: Stupak now says that his numbers are down to about six .\u00a0 If that is indeed the case, then Obamacare will pass.\nUpdate 3-20, 3:30 PM: Apparently, Rep. Boucher is not a firm \u201cno.\u201d\u00a0 That means we don\u2019t yet have the votes to defeat the bill.\nUpdate 3-20, 3:00 PM: Carney will vote yes .\u00a0 One down for Pelosi, twelve to go.\nUpdate 3-20, 2:35 PM: The list below\u00a0is of\u00a0the thirteen remaining truly undecided members.\u00a0 Pelosi needs all thirteen to win.\u00a0 There have been others that still say they are undecided but have really given strong indications of how they will vote, and almost all of those are the \u201cleaning yes\u201d types.\u00a0 So Pelosi could still lose one or two that we don\u2019t expect.\u00a0 Of these true undecided, though, the first five voted \u201cno\u201d last time, and this would be a flip.\u00a0 I feel very confident about Nye, who has consistently made signals that sound like \u201cno,\u201d and he is in a very tough re-election fight.\u00a0 I\u2019ve also been counting Space, who told Democratic leaders yesterday that he was strongly leaning towards a \u201cno.\u201d\u00a0 Berry, Carney and Kanjorski are pro-life.\u00a0\u00a0Though they aren\u2019t in Stupak\u2019s group, it\u2019s still a factor for them.\u00a0 Kanjorski would also lose jobs in his district from a Sallie Mae processing center which would be negatively affected by the student loan provisions in this bill.\u00a0 Baird and Tanner are retiring, and they clearly don\u2019t want to vote yes, but I expect that they will if Pelosi needs them.\nBaird, Brian\nSpace, Zack\nSchrader, Kurt\nUpdate 3-20, 2:32 PM: It isn\u2019t just DeFazio,\u00a0Pelosi finally got the whole regional Medicare situation \u201cfixed.\u201d\u00a0 Pelosi has filed this \u201cmanager\u2019s amendment\u201d to the legislation.\nUpdate 3-20, 2:30 PM: OK, this is Ryan again.\u00a0 I like how Firedoglake has finally realized that Schrader isn\u2019t a yes vote .\u00a0 I emailed them about this on Wednesday, and they ignored me.\u00a0 Our count has been far, far more accurate than anything else anywhere.\nUpdate 3-20, 2:12 PM (from MacAoidh): DeFazio has now flipped back to yes, according to Carl Cameron on Fox News, which now claims the Democrats have 218 votes for passage. We\u2019re not convinced yet.\nUpdate 3-20, 2:05 PM (from MacAoidh): The Rules Committee is now in recess, because Obama is about to hold a pep rally with the House Democrat Caucus, so that gives us time to show you the highlight from earlier today \u2013 which was Paul Ryan\u2019s presentation to the committee on the numbers. Every time this guy shows up to talk about numbers, the Democrats have got to hate it:\nUpdate 3-20, 1:50 PM (from MacAoidh): The Post story is now up, and it says, quoting Democrat Rep. Chris Van Hollen,\u00a0there will be three votes tomorrow\u2026\n\u2026the House would take three votes Sunday: first, on a resolution that will set the terms of debate; second, on a package of amendments to the Senate bill that have been demanded by House members; and third, on the Senate bill itself.\nVan Hollen is also quoted as saying that the \u201cdeem and pass\u201d controversy arises from a \u201ccampaign of misinformation.\u201d Chew on that for a while.\nHere\u2019s the question if all this is true: why is it that the President couldn\u2019t go to Australia and Indonesia? If the House was always going to take a vote on the Senate bill, then send a package of amendments to the Senate for reconciliation, this thing still has lots of time left in it beyond tomorrow.\nThe\u00a0conclusion one can\u2019t help but\u00a0reach is that\u00a0Obama and his people are determined to sign that Senate bill as soon as it passes the House. What would the consequences be then?\nUpdate 3-20, 1:30 PM (from MacAoidh): The Washington Post is now running a news alert saying that \u201cdeem and pass\u201d is being dropped. No explanation of what that means or where they got it; either they\u2019ve got confirmation that Waxman speaks for Pelosi or if they\u2019re just\u00a0working off what Waxman said \u2013 which may have just been him popping off. If it\u2019s the former, obviously one of two things is going on \u2013 Pelosi might think she\u2019s siphoned off a couple of Stupak\u2019s group and now\u00a0has 216 votes to pass the Senate bill, or perhaps the leadership has looked at the constitutional problems \u201cdeem and pass\u201d would put on the table.\nOn C-SPAN2, they\u2019re talking about the Post alert in the Rules committee \u2013 David Dreier, the Republican ranking member, just asked about it, and it\u2019s apparently the case.\nUpdate 3-20, 12:55 PM (from MacAoidh): On C-SPAN2 right now is live coverage of the\u00a0 markup at the House\u00a0Rules Committee, and it\u2019s pretty interesting stuff. Irritating, sure. But interesting.\nMeanwhile, Michael Barone at the Washington Examiner goes through the FireDogLake numbers, and he concludes as Ryan has that without Stupak\u2019s 11 votes (it was 12, but it\u2019s 11 now) Pelosi just can\u2019t get to 216.\nUpdate 3-20, 12:40 PM (from MacAoidh): Also from York, in a piece he wrote for the Washington Examiner today on the Rules Committee hearing this morning, is evidence of mass confusion as to exactly what the House is going to be voting on. As noted below, Henry Waxman said at the hearing that \u201cWe\u2019re not going to \u2018deem\u2019 the bill passed. We\u2019re going to pass the Senate bill\u2026I would be against the idea of \u2018deeming\u2019 something \u2014 we either pass it or we don\u2019t.\u201d\nBut perhaps Waxman either doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about or doesn\u2019t mean what it sounds like he means. York continues:\nTo Republican ears, that sounded as if Waxman was speaking out in support of a direct vote on the Senate plan. \u201cI hope we\u2019re making news here,\u201d said Republican Rep. Joe Barton. If so, Barton added, \u201cPraise the Lord!\u201d Other Democrats jumped in to say that no, there would not be a direct vote on the Senate bill.\nBarton then asked whether there would be some period of time between House passage of the Senate bill and House passage of the HCR amendments. During that period of time, the president would sign the Senate HCR bill into law. For the House to amend the HCR law, Barton said, it has to be law, which means the president has to have signed it. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, it ain\u2019t a law,\u201d Barton said.\nDemocratic Rep. Sander Levin jumped in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be amending the law,\u201d he claimed. Waxman added, \u201cWe change current law, and the current law will be the Senate bill once it\u2019s voted on in the House.\u201d\nBut it won\u2019t be law until the president signs it. Obviously, Democrats are performing such strange contortions because many of their members are scared of voting for a bill that will likely mean defeat for them in November. But their attempts to avoid responsibility have created some very basic problems.\nUpdate 3-20, 12:25 PM (from MacAoidh): Byron York tweets that if it\u2019s a \u201cdeem and pass\u201d vote, Cardozo (one of the two California Democrats who have been supposedly bought off with water for the San Fernando Valley) won\u2019t vote in favor.\nUpdate 3-20, 11:40 AM (from MacAoidh): The Corner just reported that Pelosi has said there will be \u201cno separate votes\u201d on the bill, which would more or less confirm that the Stupak deal is dead. It also just reported that Driehaus and Dahlkemper, who are two of Stupak\u2019s 12, are in Pelosi\u2019s office right now.\nUpdate 3-20, 11:30 AM (from MacAoidh): Here\u2019s a live stream of the tea party rally outside of the Capitol.\nUpdate 3-20, 11:20 AM (from MacAoidh): This one isn\u2019t a big surprise, but it\u2019s a lesson for the GOP \u2013 Bill Owens is voting yes . Owens is the Rep from NY-23 in case you forgot; he barely beat Doug Hoffman and promptly voted for Obamacare the first time it came through the House.\nUpdate 3-20, 11:15 AM (from MacAoidh): Meanwhile away from the Beltway, somebody did to Louise Slaughter\u2019s office window what her Rules Committee did to the Constitution.\nUpdate 3-20, 11:00 AM (from MacAoidh): From The Corner on NRO , comes this story out of the contentious House Rules Committee hearing:\nA rough and rowdy Rules Committee hearing just ended, but not before it had another great moment. Challenged by Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (D., Fla.) over Deem-and-Pass, Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) responded, with not a little dissimulation: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to deem the Senate bill passed.We\u2019re going to pass the Senate bill. We\u2019re going to pass it by a vote in the House.\u201d (Editor\u2019s Note: No, they won\u2019t.)\nRep. Joe Barton (R., Texas) responded. \u201cWe\u2019re making news here. . . Praise the Lord!\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 10:50 AM (from MacAoidh): A tweet from Fox News now says Baron Hill is voting \u201cyes.\u201d He was considered to be a likely switch to \u201cno,\u201d having voted for the original House Bill.\nUpdate 3-20, 10:42 AM (from MacAoidh): TheHill.com reports that Stupak has cancelled his press conference today, which would indicate that the deal is dead. Pelosi couldn\u2019t make it work. If this thing fails, it will be interesting to see who eventually gets the blame \u2013 the pro-choice Democrats, for holding up Obamacare because of a need for federal funding of abortion, or the pro-life Democrats for \u201cturning coat\u201d and joining with the Republicans.\nMeanwhile, a Stupak spokeswoman told Fox News\u2019 Neil Cavuto that \u201cnegotiations are ongoing.\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 9:50 AM: Greta van Susteren gets word that there will be no deal and hears that Stupak\u2019s press conference may be canceled.\nUpdate 3-20, 9:43 AM: On the amendments issue, my understanding is that amendments aren\u2019t allowed under reconciliation rules.\u00a0 So all of them are either for delay, or to make a point so that those voting yes can campaign saying, \u201cWell, I know that the bill was bad, but I offered this amendment, see\u2026\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 9:30 AM: Some people have been worried that Stupak may cave; I feel sure that he won\u2019t.\u00a0 For Stupak, there is something larger on the line than Obamacare \u2014 the future of pro-life Democrats.\u00a0 If he caves, or if he settles for something that turns out to be\u00a0a \u201cprotest vote,\u201d then the pro-life movement will never trust anyone again who claims to be a pro-life Democrat.\u00a0 What\u2019s more, the Democratic leadership will never regard their convictions with any value.\u00a0 On the other hand, if the Stupak gang holds, we have a watershed moment in American politics.\u00a0 Whether he forces a Pelosi deal, or whether Obamacare goes down in defeat, pro-lifers will have a place of regard and respect in the Democratic Party.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the pro-choice crowd is upset \u2014 they know that many people will blame them for the failure of Obamacare to pass, because they essentially insisted on public funding of abortion.\nUpdate 3-20, 9:10 AM (from MacAoidh): Ed Morrissey at HotAir has a summary of the 91 amendments\u00a0submitted to\u00a0the House Rules Committee in advance of tomorrow\u2019s vote, broken down alphabetically by author. Some of these are quite creative. Most of them are by Republicans seeking to blow up the bill, and of course those won\u2019t pass \u2013 Democrats on the committee voting against them will be forced to provide their fall opponents with some pretty juicy campaign fodder, though.\nAnd then you\u2019ve got the lefty amendments, like the one from well-known kook Alan Grayson which would allow folks to buy in to Medicare at cost\u2026\nUpdate 3-20, 8:55 AM: As I predicted last night, prospects for a Stupak deal appear to be collapsing .\u00a0 I\u2019m putting the word \u201cdeath\u201d back in the thread title \u2014 shame on me for taking it out.\nUpdate 3-20, 8:00 AM: Stupak was right.\u00a0 Back on Wednesday, he told The Hill in an interview:\n\u201cThey\u2019ll call me the night before and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got to work this out. We don\u2019t have the votes,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen we get serious.\u201d\nUpdate 3-20, 7:50 AM: On the Ellsworth situation, Freddoso is a smart guy, but if he had been reading this page he\u2019d know that he\u2019s wrong \u2014 Pelosi sacrificed Ellsworth in a failed attempt to \u201ckeep the momentum going\u201d to make people think that Obamacare would pass.\u00a0 His U.S. Senate campaign is basically over before its really even started, and she ran out of votes and (to avoid losing)\u00a0is now trying to make a deal with Stupak that she could have made days or weeks ago and given her plenty of votes to spare so Ellsworth could vote no.\u00a0 She destroyed his Senate campaign and his pro-life credibility and got nothing out of it.\nUpdate 3-20, 7:40 AM: Thanks for the assist, Scott.\u00a0 Please keep pitching in.\nSome people have been confused because Fox News has been reporting since the Kosmas flip that Pelosi has the votes.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how to express how dumb this is.\u00a0 She did not have the votes for a bill then, and she doesn\u2019t have the votes for a bill now.\u00a0 She can potentially allow changes to the bill to get the Stupak group to vote yes and win, but such changes might cost her more votes than she gets.\u00a0 It was always clear that she would have the votes if she could successfully make a deal with Stupak.\u00a0 She is also still trying to \u201cfix\u201d the bill to satisfy DeFazio and the many silent members that he says will vote \u201cno\u201d with him if the regional Medicare disparity isn\u2019t changed the way they want.\nUpdate 3-20, 12:10 PM (from MacAoidh): One more thing before we hit this again in the morning \u2013 the Washington Examiner\u2019s Beltway Confidential blog\u00a0picks up\u00a0on the Brad Ellsworth situation with\u00a0a piece\u00a0about the political cost Ellsworth is\u00a0facing for having switched his vote to \u201cyes.\u201d Specifically, Ellsworth\u2019s likely Republican opponent in the Indiana Senate race, Dan Coats, put out a scathing rebuke of Ellsworth\u2019s \u201cyea,\u201d complete with a letter from Gov. Mitch Daniels outlining all the terrible effects the bill will have on\u00a0the Hoosier state.\nBeltway Confidential\u2019s David Freddoso comes to the conclusion that this is going to destroy any chance Ellsworth would have of winning that\u00a0Senate race, and then offers this analysis:\nIf Ellsworth is being pushed into voting for this, you can bet that Speaker Pelosi has no votes to spare. But by the same token, you wouldn\u2019t be hearing him commit in public if she didn\u2019t have the votes.\nUpdate 3-19, 11:51 PM (from MacAoidh): According to POLITICO , Obama will address the House Democratic Caucus at the Capitol at 3 PM Eastern time tomorrow. Harry Reid will be there as well. That\u2019s going to make for an interesting crowd-control situation, as the Tea Party Patriots, Americans For Tax\u00a0Reform\u00a0and FreedomWorks, among others, have a sizable rally planned for noon at the Capitol\u2019s West Lawn, with Steve King, Michele Bachmann and actor Jon Voigt set to speak. Does anybody worry that things might get a little dicey?\nUpdate 3-19, 11:30 PM: One last one before I turn out the lights: Allahpundit over at Hot Air has a lot of speculation on the proposed Stupak deal, but like me, he says we\u2019ll ultimately find out tomorrow.\nUpdate 3-19, 11:15 PM: Tony Perkins and Steny Hoyer , two men with very little in common, both\u00a0say that\u00a0Stupak\u2019s deal won\u2019t work.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see tomorrow.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to bed.\nUpdate 3-19, 10:50 PM: I was going to update my complete vote count tonight, but I\u2019ve decided that would be a waste of time.\u00a0 It is clear that Obamacare will fail if a Pelosi-Stupak deal does not successfully take place.\u00a0 What is not clear is whether such a purported deal can succeed, either technically, or within the Democratic caucus.\nWhat I still find astonishing is the timing.\u00a0 Anyone who actually looked at the individual votes and counted them could see that the votes to pass Obamacare simply were not there.\u00a0 Incredibly, no one else did this \u2014 least of all Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0 The damage that she has done to her own caucus is substantial, and she could lose the Speaker\u2019s post over this.\u00a0 What was the point, for example,\u00a0of forcing Rep. Ellsworth to seriously damage his U.S. Senate campaign earlier today by forcing him to declare his support for the bill?\u00a0 If she were going to make a deal with Stupak, she could have let Ellsworth keep his pro-life credentials instead of exposing him as a fraud.\u00a0 I think a lot of Democratic members are going to be very, very angry with her for her incompetent handling of this situation, no matter whether Obamacare ends up passing or not.\u00a0 This is going to have lasting consequences for congressional Democrats.\nUpdate 3-19, 10:30 PM: I\u2019m stunned.\u00a0 There is a deal.\u00a0 Pelosi has sold out to Stupak.\u00a0 He will get his vote, at least if Pelosi gets her way.\u00a0 In what is now an incredible irony, conservatives\u2019 hopes of killing Obamacare reside in the strength of the pro-choice caucus, which supposedly had 41 members who would vote no on Obamacare if Stupak got his way. Firedoglake has all the details \u2014 just go there and read it.\nUpdate 3-19, 9:40 PM: Firedoglake finally gets it :\u00a0 there is no path to passage of health care reform without some kind of abortion deal.\u00a0 David Dayen, writing there, thinks that there will be a deal, because he sees passage as inevitable.\u00a0 Clearly, I don\u2019t.\u00a0 I see a bunch of people who know that this is extremely unpopular and would love to have a good reason to scuttle the leadership\u2019s plans.\u00a0 Once it becomes clear to everyone else that the bill won\u2019t pass, they will all start demanding stuff like DeFazio \u201cor I won\u2019t vote for the bill.\u201d\u00a0 Then it will die without a vote, as I predicted back on Monday.\nUpdate 3-19, 9:35 PM: I\u2019m not bothering with the links, but Berkley, Kilroy, and Tonko all confirmed today that they would vote yes.\u00a0 I was already counting them all as yes.\u00a0 The whip count at The Hill is hopelessly behind and is pretty useless now.\nUpdate 3-19, 9:28 PM: Just to compound Pelosi\u2019s difficulties, another Democrat is saying that he\u2019s undecided because the bill doesn\u2019t fund enough abortions.\u00a0 He won\u2019t actually vote against the bill, of course, but these constant brush fires that Pelosi has to put out just compound her difficulties.\nUpdate 3-19, 9:25 PM: Thanks to commenter Dave, I learned that Teague has confirmed that he\u2019s a no .\u00a0 That\u2019s how we had him, but other counts like Firedoglake had him as undecided.\nUpdate 3-19 8:50 PM: It makes you wonder. These guys are obviously very slow readers .\u00a0 It\u2019s been a whole day and they haven\u2019t been able to read 150 pages.\nUpdate 3-19, 8:45 PM: Since Solomon Ortiz has a press conference scheduled for tomorrow, I\u2019m taking him off my undecided list and calling him a yes vote.\u00a0 It had been speculated that he was part of Stupak\u2019s group, but if he were, he\u2019d simply be going to the Stupak group press conference.\nUpdate 3-19, 8:35 PM: McNerney is leaning yes .\u00a0 I\u2019ll take him off my undecided list.\u00a0 I had hopes for him based on his vote yesterday against \u201cdeem and pass.\u201d\nUpdate 3-19, 8:25 PM: More on Stupak\u2019s proposal and how it would work (and why it won\u2019t).\nUpdate 3-19, 7:52 PM: Whoa. Rep. DeFazio is dead serious about voting no , bragging about voting no on the stimulus and cap and trade when his demands weren\u2019t met.\u00a0 And since I don\u2019t think that Pelosi has a good way to \u201cfix\u201d Medicare reimbursement at this stage of the game, I\u2019m going to count him as voting no.\u00a0 The \u201cno\u201d side now has 217 votes.\nUpdate 3-19, 7:40 PM: CNN is reporting that there is no deal, which is what I thought and continue to think.\u00a0 This is theater and butt-covering.\nAnti-abortion Democrat Bart Stupak of Michigan is asking for a vote on his language restricting taxpayer funding for abortion, and a group of female abortion rights Democrats came out of an emergency meeting in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office Friday evening visibly angry about the prospect.\nRep. Diana Degette, D-Colorado, told reporters a vote on Stupak\u2019s measure was a \u201cnon starter\u201d and said \u201csomewhere between 40 and 55\u2033 abortion rights Democrats would bolt from the bill.\n\u201cWe are holding firm this time,\u201d she insisted. \u201cIf Mr. Stupak and a few members along with the Republicans decide to use this to take health care down, that loss of health care will be in their hands.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how seriously Democratic leaders are considering allowing a vote on Stupak\u2019s abortion language, or in what form.\nBut Stupak told CNN he is in discussions with Pelosi.\n\u201cWe had a good discussion with the speaker on the floor,\u201d said Stupak. \u201cBut there was no agreement and there\u2019s no agreement until we see it in writing and we get a chance to massage it.\u201d\nUpdate 3-19, 7:30 PM: OK, where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire: reporter Molly Hooper of The Hill tweets :\nStupak told me Dem leaders \u201cdon\u2019t have the votes, or they wouldn\u2019t be talking to me.\u201d He holds a presser on Sat at 11am and hopes he\u2019ll have an agreement to announce. Leaving the Capitol, he told me \u201cthere\u2019s a proposal out there but nothing yet and we want to see it in writing and massage it,\u201d which is what he told the Speaker during the 10 min pow wow.\u00a0 Rep. Becerra confirms that there are \u201canimated discussions\u201d going on over the abortion language with both sides.\nI guess I have to take \u201cDeath\u201d out of the title of the post\u00a0now.\nUpdate 3-19, 7:25 PM: Rep. Mitchell will vote yes .\u00a0 He was an undecided vote that it would have been nice to have.\nUpdate 3-19, 7:20 PM: On the other hand, pro-choice Rep. Diana DeGette said, as she left Pelosi\u2019s office ,\u00a0\u201dWe\u2019re not happy.\u201d\u00a0 So maybe there is a Stupak deal.\nUpdate 3-19, 7:10 PM: Stupak reportedly met with Pelosi tonight.\u00a0 I still don\u2019t think there\u2019s a deal \u2014 it\u2019s just too impractical.\u00a0 What I think is happening is that both of them want to be able to say that they tried their hardest to make a deal.\u00a0 Both of them need to be able to blame the other\u2019s stubborness, because Stupak\u2019s group will be unpopular in their own party, and Pelosi wants to get as little of the blame as possible.\nUpdate 3-19, 6:45 PM: Stupak\u2019s press conference \u201cwith other pro-life Democrats\u201d will be at 10:00 AM tomorrow.\u00a0 Is it to announce a deal?\u00a0 Stupak has always said that he would not accept a promise of future action, so I\u2019m skeptical, but we\u2019ll see.\nUpdate 3-19, 6:35 PM: Rep. Barrow will\u00a0vote no. I had considered him a likely target for Pelosi and had him as undecided.\u00a0 That puts my own \u201cno\u201d count back to 216.\u00a0 The only way this bill will pass is if Pelosi can get a deal on abortion.\nUpdate 3-19, 6:30 PM: Eric Cantor says , \u201cThere\u2019s no way they can pass this bill.\u201d\nUpdate 3-19, 6:18 PM: People always give Larry Sabato too much credit.\u00a0 He tweets: \u201cThis will be a spectacular weekend as spring is sprung. Don\u2019t waste it watching media counts on health care. It\u2019s over. Bill will pass House.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019ll see who\u2019s right soon enough, Larry.\nUpdate 3-19, 6:10 PM: Firedoglake , which is a very liberal blog, is depressed about their prospects.\u00a0 David Dayen is doing a good job, but he\u2019s completely ignoring McNerney and Schrader, and should have Space and Teague as \u201cno\u201d votes instead of undecided, so the count is worse than he thinks:\nIf you look hard at the numbers, you can see why Pelosi is talking with Stupak and pro-choice women. With 214 No or lean No votes (including the Stupak bloc), Pelosi would have to prevent Dahlkemper and Kaptur from joining them. Then she would need all the other uncommitted votes, save one. That means she would have to get everyone who voted yes last time, plus Jim Matheson or Harry Teague (and all the lean Yes votes who went No last time, like Brian Baird and John Tanner). It\u2019s just not that plausible.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:53 PM: Pelosi has switched seven former no votes: Kucinich, Boyd, Gordon, Markey, Boccieri, Kosmas, and now Murphy.\u00a0 In the very beginning, I said that I thought she could switch seven.\u00a0 Now, though, I\u2019m still giving her Tanner and Baird.\u00a0 That would be nine.\u00a0 If we get Arcuri, Lynch, and Space, and if the Stupak group is seven, then we\u2019re still ahead.\u00a0 My gut is that Stupak\u2019s group is really nine.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:48 PM: \u201cPro-choice female Dems are shuttling in and out of Pelosi\u2019s office and they won\u2019t say why.\u201d Tweet from a reporter for The Hill.\u00a0 Perhaps a Stupak deal is in the works, after all, or at least being attempted.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:45 PM: Scott Murphy is, as expected, a yes .\u00a0 Pelosi still hasn\u2019t flipped a vote that we didn\u2019t expect.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:38 PM: By the way, Bart Stupak has a press conference scheduled for tomorrow morning.\u00a0 Maybe he\u2019ll have his group with him and we\u2019ll find out for sure about Carney, Dahlkemper, Berry, Ortiz, Kanjorski and Kaptur.\u00a0 We know that Stupak, Costello, Driehaus, Donnelly, Rahall, and Lipinski are in his group, but if his dozen turns out to be six, Pelosi has a chance.\u00a0 I\u2019m still counting Dahlkemper and Kaptur, but I don\u2019t mind trading them for the other names I mentioned.\u00a0 I just counted again and that would leave us at 215, so we really need the Stupak group to be nine or get one of the other undecided votes, since I don\u2019t feel that I can count DeFazio.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:18 PM: Here\u2019s a very good article explaining the Medicare reimbursement problem that DeFazio and others have with the bill.\u00a0 I\u2019m still not counting DeFazio as a no, because I still expect this to get worked out somehow, though that will be very difficult.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:15 PM: I still can\u2019t believe that the Democrats just gave up a U.S. Senate seat.\u00a0 Ellsworth was going to have a tough campaign for Evan Bayh\u2019s seat in Indiana, but now he has no chance.\u00a0 If the Democrats weren\u2019t frantically desperate, they would have protected him and let him vote no.\nUpdate 3-19, 5:08 PM: Firedoglake has a new count 200\u00a0YES to 209 NO, 207\u00a0YES to 212 NO with leaners included.\u00a0 It\u2019s a good count, but we know from multiple reports that Space is leaning no, and Rahall is a flat-out no.\u00a0 That count also has Kaptur as a \u201cleaning yes\u201d, but she has said that the\u00a0current abortion language is \u201cunacceptable,\u201d so that would take a lot of explaining.\u00a0 They have also ignored McNerney and Schrader, both whom I think are \u201cundecided,\u201d if not \u201cleaning no.\u201d\nUpdate 3-19, 4:40 PM: Maybe I\u2019m counting chickens before they are hatched: Ellsworth is a yes .\u00a0 Ellsworth is running for U.S. Senate in Indiana, so he\u2019s dead meat either way, but this is bad news, as I had him pegged solidly in the Stupak bloc and was counting on his vote.\u00a0 Perhaps I should now re-evaluate other members of the Stupak bloc.\nUpdate 3-19, 4:30 PM: Kosmas will switch from last time and vote yes .\u00a0 She was \u201cundecided\u201d in my book, so we still have 217.\nUpdate 3-19, 4:20 PM: Don\u2019t hyperventilate over this statement from Joseph Cao that he \u201chopes to reconsider\u201d his vote this weekend if Pelosi deals on abortion.\u00a0 Cao knows perfectly well that such a deal is impossible.\u00a0 The other Stupak members are saying similar things to protect them\u00a0with their Democratic base.\u00a0\u00a0In Cao\u2019s case, most of the electorate in his district is Democrat.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget that the 2008 vote in LA-2 was Obama 75%, McCain 23%.\nUpdate 3-19, 3:45 PM: \u201c There are a number of people who may be miscounted at this time ,\u201d DeFazio said of the \u201cyes\u201d vote count.\u00a0 This is the kind of thing that can happen when you are desperately changing a bill to get workable CBO numbers: you make one change accidentally\u00a0and critically damage a bill.\u00a0 Even if there is a way for Pelosi to \u201cfix\u201d this through parliamentary procedure, she can\u2019t send the bill back to the CBO now.\u00a0 Under reconciliation rules, this bill must reduce the deficit from the Senate bill.\u00a0 If she adds back in money now\u00a0to fix the regional Medicare disbursement, the bill will probably cost too much to be considered under reconciliation rules.\u00a0 I thought the bill would fail anyway, but this has got to be the nail in the coffin.\nUpdate 3-19, 3:30 PM: Read DeFazio\u2019s statement about why he plans to vote no.\u00a0 That gives the \u201cno\u201d side a solid 217 votes, enough to kill the bill with one to spare.\u00a0 There may be a way for Pelosi to \u201cfix\u201d this for DeFazio, though.\nUpdate 3-19, 3:25 PM: Altmire will vote no! That should just about do it, folks.\u00a0 And Boyd switches to yes , but readers of this space already knew that was likely.\u00a0 Baird and Scott Murphy are her likely next victims.\nUpdate 3-19, 2:50 PM: Cuellar was a longshot, but he sounds like a yes .\nUpdate 3-19, 2:38 PM: John McCormack in The Weekly Standard is as optimistic as I am.\u00a0 I also think that Stupak has the same nine that he does (though I have some concern about Berry).\u00a0 Even if it ends up being eight, those and Arcuri and Lynch mean that Pelosi would have to flip ten to win, and I just can\u2019t see it.\nUpdate 3-19, 2:30 PM: Perriello says that he\u2019s a yes \u2026 maybe .\u00a0 He\u2019ll vote for the bill if he gets written assurances from 50 senators that the parts he doesn\u2019t like will be taken out.\u00a0 Says that he doesn\u2019t think the bill will fund abortions.\u00a0 This one is unfortunate, as I thought he would be with us after voting against \u201cdeem and pass\u201d yesterday.\u00a0 That puts us at 214 solid.\nUpdate 3-19, 2:15 PM: Paul Ryan says that\u2019s it\u2019s 50-50 .\u00a0 The problem is that it\u2019s hard for the House GOP to really know what\u2019s going on, as all the discussion is on the Democratic side.\nUpdate 3-19, 2:05 PM: Holy Cow. This is insane .\u00a0 Politico has obtained a document (they have pulled the story until they can verify its origins), that supposedly promises that the \u201cDoc fix\u201d will come later on \u2026 but don\u2019t talk about it now because it\u2019ll hurt the bill.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see if the document is real.\u00a0 If so, she\u2019ll lose every Blue Dog vote.\nUpdate 3-19, 1:45 PM: Dick Morris is right (thanks for the tip, Scott) that Pelosi is on a \u201csuicide run.\u201d\u00a0 Why is she pushing for a vote on Sunday when it\u2019s still likely she\u2019ll lose?\u00a0 Because Democrats have no choice.\u00a0 The longer this drags out, the worse it is for them, because eventually the public will wear down her members into voting no.\u00a0 She can\u2019t let them go home for Easter or it\u2019s over.\u00a0 In fact, if they don\u2019t vote on Sunday, everyone will see that the emperor has no clothes, so she has to push forward and hope for a miracle.\nUpdate 3-19, 1:23 PM: Pelosi shoots down any Stupak deal .\u00a0 As I said, it was all about Stupak & Co. being able to say that they did everything they could \u2014 and also a way for them to stay undecided as long as possible.\u00a0 Now, we\u2019ll start to find out just how many and how strong the Stupak group is.\nUpdate 3-19, 1:00 PM: What is amazing to me is how bad of a job other media outlets are doing or reporting on\u00a0the vote count. Take this brand new article from The Hill , a publication that a lot of people pay good money for.\u00a0 They list Shea-Porter and Kagen as \u201cleaning yes\u201d when they have in fact publicly said that they will vote yes.\u00a0 They also have Zack Space as \u201cleaning yes\u201d when the Washington Post reported this morning that he in fact has informed House leadership that he plans to vote no.\nUpdate 3-19, 12:45 PM: Accoring to the same Huff Post link below, DeFazio is not alone in demanding that his state get its fair share in Medicare disbursements.\u00a0 Pelosi\u2019s team is scrambling.\u00a0 If they start losing otherwise liberal members over this, they have no hope.\u00a0 The Democrats will get this worked out, but this just indicates the disorganized mess that the their effort has turned into.\nUpdate 3-19, 11:44 AM: According to the Huffington Post , Dina Titus is a yes \u2014 she was previously undecided.\u00a0 Also, DeFazio has been a \u201cyes,\u201d but he now says that he\u2019s a no unless the bill is changed so that Oregon gets its fair share of Medicare disbursements.\u00a0 Pelosi says that she\u2019s working on it (I thought that special deals were out?\u00a0 Ha.)\nUpdate 3-19, 11:12 AM: By the way, the talk of a Stupak deal is entirely one-sided.\u00a0 Stupak and his gang are talking about a deal because they want Democratic primary voters (and potential primary challengers) to know that they really, really wanted to vote for comprehensive health care reform that would guarantee coverage to millions of uninsured, etc.\u00a0 The Democratic leadership\nUpdate 3-19, 11:03 AM: Another story about a possible deal with Stupak .\u00a0 Again, I don\u2019t really think a deal is possible, because the Democratic House women will revolt and the Senate won\u2019t go along.\u00a0 No, the big news in the story is Rahall saying that he is a solid member of the Stupak bloc and will vote \u201cno\u201d unless the abortion language is changed.\u00a0 That\u2019s awesome!\u00a0 It still leaves us at 215, though, since I just took Carney out.\nUpdate 3-19, 10:55 AM: Not good news: I think I need to take Chris Carney out of my \u201cno\u201d count .\u00a0 His committment to Stupak doesn\u2019t seem secure.\u00a0 He goes back into the \u201cundecided\u201d list.\nUpdate 3-19, 10:50 AM: This is great news: The Washington Post is reporting that Zach Space has told House leaders that he is leaning \u201cno.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 I had him as leaning \u201cyes\u201d and hadn\u2019t thought this likely.\u00a0 If he were truly a \u201cno\u201d, that would put opponents at 216, but I\u2019ll wait for more confirmation.\nUpdate 3-19, 10:40 AM: Former\u00a0Rep. Tom Delay, known as \u201cThe Hammer\u201d for his ability to round up votes, is pessimistic about our chances of defeating the bill.\u00a0 He says that Kaptur is just too liberal to vote \u201cno,\u201d no matter the her promises to Stupak, and that Costello \u201ccan be bought.\u201d\nUpdate 3-19, 10:35 AM: As I expected, Boccieri will vote switch and vote yes .\nUpdate 3-19, 9:37 AM: I\u2019m now ready to officially add Lynch to the \u201cno\u201d column .\u00a0 I\u2019ve hesitated because he\u2019s generally pretty liberal, but he met with the President yesterday, and the visit didn\u2019t sway him.\u00a0 That puts my \u201cno\u201d count at a pretty solid 215, with 14 pretty good prospects.\u00a0 Pelosi would need all 14, plus all her other wavering votes.\nUpdate 3-19, 9:15 AM: Updated most-likely-to-switch lists from Politico are out.\u00a0 These are dead on, in my opinion.\nNO-TO-YES: 1) Kucinich, 2) Gordon, 3) Markey, 4) Baird, 5) Boccieri, 6) Boyd, 7) Scott Murphy, 8 ) Kosmas, 9) Altmire, 10) Kissell, 11) Tanner, 12) Teague, 13) Matheson, 14) McMahon, 15) Barrow, 16) Chandler\nYES-TO-NO: 1) Stupak, 2) Arcuri, 3) Lynch, 4) Donnelly, 5) Lipinski, 6) Costello, 7) Driehaus, 8 ) Dahlkemper, 9) Ellsworth, 10) Kaptur, 11) Carney, 12) Berry, 13) Pomeroy, 14) Space, 15) Cuellar, 16) Mollohan, 17) Mitchell, 18) Titus, 19) Foster, 20) Bean, 21) Hill, 22) Owens, 23) Kanjorski, 24) Rahall, 25) Etheridge, 26) Ortiz\nI\u2019m very confident that Pelosi will get 4-7 on her target list, and I have some concerns about 8-11, and I would have had had Barrow ranked higher than 15, though maybe they know something I don\u2019t.\u00a0 She isn\u2019t getting Teague, Chandler, or McMahon though.\u00a0 On the other hand, Stupak has rallied his troops and I think that 1-11 are very solid \u201cno\u201d votes at this point (all except Arcuri and Lynch are his).\u00a0 I also feel very good about our chances with 13-20, Kanjorski (student loan provision would eliminate jobs at a Sallie Mae processing center in his district), and McNerny and Schrader (who have both kept a low enough profile to stay off these lists).\nUpdate 3-19, 9:00 AM: Democrats are bragging that they are within five votes; they are lying.\u00a0 They have lied throughout this process to create the sense of inevitability of the bill \u2014 remember Rep. Larson saying on Monday that they had the votes then?\u00a0 Pelosi is still at least 15 votes away and probably 20.\nUpdate 3-19, 8:45 AM: Rep. Boccieri has a 9:40 CT\u00a0press conference to announce his vote.\u00a0 He\u2019s most likely switching his vote from \u201cno\u201d to \u201cyes.\u201d\u00a0 He is a must get and an expected get for Pelosi, which is why I didn\u2019t even list him in my \u201cundecided\u201d count below.\u00a0 For the record, I also expect her to get Boyd, Tanner, Baird, and Scott Murphy to switch from \u201cno\u201d to \u201cyes.\u201d\u00a0 Those, plus Kucinich, Gordon, and Markey, would still be counterbalanced by a Stupak group of\u00a0eight and Arcuri.\u00a0 If she flips any \u201cno\u201d votes other than those eight, then it gets interesting.\nUpdate 3-19, 8:30 AM: There is new talk of a deal with Stupak on abortion.\u00a0 In my opinion, this is the only way that Obamacare can win, but it will come at a heavy cost to Democrats.\u00a0 I think he might face more liberal defections than he gets back with Stupak, as the pro-choice groups only went along with Stupak the first time because they were promised it would be cut out in conference committee.\u00a0 And, as Stupak just said on ABC, the deal has to include the Senate \u2014 a tall order.\nUpdate 3-19, 6:11 AM: After reading this , I\u2019m going to move Lynch back to \u201cleaning no,\u201d but I\u2019m not counting on his vote.\u00a0 He\u2019s a pretty liberal guy, though his district went 55% for Scott Brown.\nUpdate 3-18, 11:15 PM: Joseph Cao reviewed the Senate language again, per the President\u2019s request, and found that it still funded abortions.\u00a0 So he\u2019s still a no.\nUpdate 3-18, 10:45 PM: I\u2019m going to ignore Bobby Rush\u2019s silliness .\u00a0 There is simply\u00a0no way that he will vote against Obamacare.\u00a0 The only good thing about this is that it is one more distraction for Pelosi & Co.\nUpdate 3-18, 8:15 PM: I\u2019ve been working and haven\u2019t had time to do a proper analysis of today\u2019s the \u201cdeem and pass\u201d rule challenge.\u00a0 Fortunately, Michael Barone was on the case .\u00a0 Before I get into the individual members, I think that the vote was very revealing \u2014 it showed Pelosi just how far behind she is.\u00a0\u00a0By exposing her problems, though,\u00a0she knows who her problems are, which may help her \u201cfix\u201d them (which is not good for our side).\nNow, voting for \u201cdeem and pass\u201d does not necessarily indicate a vote for the main bill \u2014 the Stupak group, for instance, will vote against the main bill because of abortion, not deem and pass.\u00a0 Likewise, it\u2019s possible (though much less likely)\u00a0that a member could vote against deem and pass and still think that Obamacare is so wonderful that they vote for the main bill despite disapproving of the procedure.\nWith those caveats in place, Barone starts off:\nOf the 28 Democrats voting no, 16 voted against the House health care bill last November: Bright (AL 2), Davis (AL 7), Kosmas (FL 24), Minnick (ID 1), Melancon (LA 3), Kratovil (MD 1), Childers (MS 1), Taylor (MS 4), Adler (NJ 3), Teague (NM 2), McIntyre (NC 7), Shuler (NC 11), Boren (OK 2), Holden (PA 17), Herseth Sandlin (SD 1), Nye (VA 2).\nThat firms up Nye from a \u201clean no\u201d to\u00a0a \u201cno\u201d in my book, and moves Kosmas back to a \u201clean no\u201d from a \u201clean yes\u201d.\u00a0 She has been a prime target for a flip, and this was a strong vote against the leadership.\u00a0 Some lists also had Teague and Childers\u00a0as possible Dem targets, and this should remove them as well.\nOf the Democrats who voted \u201cyes\u201d last year but voted against \u201cdeem and pass,\u201d Stupak, Lipinski, Costello, and Carney were already known to be opposing the bill because of abortion.\u00a0 Dahlkemper\u2019s vote today confirms her as a member of the Stupak bloc and a \u201cno\u201d vote on the bill (I previously had her as undecided).\u00a0 Of the others, McNerny and Perriello were undecided and this puts them into the \u201clean no\u201d category.\u00a0 I had pegged Giffords as voting \u201cyes,\u201d so I\u2019ll move her back to undecided along with Mitchell, and Cooper.\u00a0 Michaud isn\u2019t on my radar screen, so I\u2019m leave that vote as a \u201cyes\u201d until I get more information.\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m very perplexed that Lynch and Altmire voted for \u201cdeem and pass,\u201d as both of them have publicly blasted the procedure.\u00a0 I\u2019m now going to put both of them as \u201cundecided\u201d and take them out of the \u201cno\u201d column.\nI\u2019m really only counting \u201cno\u201d votes at this point, because most of the undecided members will vote yes.\u00a0 I\u2019m confident in 214 votes right now, and there are 8 more that I think are at least 50-50, with some others that are still good possibilities.\u00a0 These are the Democrats in my count as voting no:\nAdler\n"}, {"score": 1020.7302, "uuid": "36b6ced7-0552-5b54-ad82-3b543af52f81", "index": "cw12",

The opinions expressed are\nhis own.)\nCHICAGO, March 28 (Reuters) - Ordinary Americans have a lot\nat stake this week as the Supreme Court holds hearings on the\nconstitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\nIt is not clear what the outcome will be, and it is not\nclear where Americans stand on it. While two-thirds of\nAmericans oppose the individual insurance mandate that is at the\nheart of the Obama Administration's healthcare reform law,\naccording to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey, the polls also\nreveal more nuanced attitudes.\nAmericans are evenly divided on the overall law, with 47\npercent supporting it, according to Pew Research. And a New York\nTimes/CBS News poll finds that many of the law's key provisions\nare backed by large majorities: the law's popular features\ninclude the requirement that insurance companies cover people\nwith pre-existing conditions (85 percent), letting children stay\non parents' policies until age 26 (68 percent) and cutting the\ncost of prescription drugs for seniors (77 percent).\nHere's a breakdown of what is at stake if the Supreme Court\nstrikes down the law:\nBENEFITS ALREADY IN PLACE: Although key benefits of the ACA\nwon't be implemented until 2014, significant changes are already\nin place. For example, 2.5 million young adults age 19 to 25 are\nnow covered on their parents' policies. For Medicare, the first\nsteps to close the gap in prescription drug coverage -- the\nnotorious \"donut hole\" -- saved $2.1 billion for nearly 3.6\nmillion seniors last year, according to the U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services.\nSTATE EXCHANGES: State insurance exchanges, which are being\nset up now and will fully launch in 2014, will open up access to\ninsurance for anyone who can't access group healthcare coverage\nthrough the workplace -- a crucial, growing problem in an\neconomy characterized by volatility and stubbornly high levels\nof structural unemployment.\nFor example, nine million Americans age 50 to 64 were\nuninsured as of 2010 -- up from 5.3 million in 2002, according\nto The Commonwealth Fund. Too young for Medicare, their only\noption now is the individual insurance market, where premium\nprices are high, coverage is partial and many can't buy policies\nat all due to pre-existing conditions. Nine million individuals\nwere turned down for coverage in the individual market over the\npast three years due to pre-existing conditions, Commonwealth\nsays.\nStarting in 2014, the law will ban charging higher premiums\nor denying coverage based on health or age, and insurance\ncompanies will no longer be permitted to disqualify applicants\nbased on pre-existing conditions. And applicants will be\neligible for federal subsidies on the cost of coverage if they\nmake less than 400 percent of the federally defined poverty\nlevel -- currently $92,000 for a family of four. For this group,\nthe subsidy uses a sliding scale to hold costs as a share of\nincome between 2 percent and 9.5 percent.\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that 23\nmillion Americans will gain coverage through the state exchanges\nby 2019. \"That's a very sweeping change for people who need to\nretire early, are unemployed, or have a job that doesn't offer\nhealth care benefits,\" says Sara Collins, vice president for\naffordable insurance at The Commonwealth Fund.\nThe process will start with an application for insurance\nsubmitted to your state exchange; depending on your income,\nyou'll be eligible to buy a policy in the exchange -- or receive\ncoverage under Medicaid.\nMEDICAID EXPANSION: Medicaid primarily serves parents with\nvery low incomes, and few states cover adults who do not have\nchildren. The ACA provides federal funding for a dramatic\nexpansion of Medicaid. The new program will serve all households\nthat are living around the federal poverty level -- about\n$30,000 in annual income for a family of four. Fifty-seven\npercent of adults in that income range were uninsured for at\nleast part of 2011, and 41 percent were uninsured for one year\nor longer.\nSo that's what's at stake if the healthcare reform law is\nstruck down by the Supreme Court. All told, 31 million Americans\nwho otherwise would have health insurance won't be covered at\nthe end of this decade, and we'll be back to the drawing board\non healthcare reform. Here's hoping it doesn't happen.\n(Editing by Beth Pinsker Gladstone and Andrea Evans)\nFOLLOW HUFFPOST MONEY\n"}, {"score": 1006.92596, "uuid": "08607a52-f013-526c-a588-dcb6634caf2f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1401wb-78-16623", "target_hostname": "www.pulitzer.org", "target_uri": "http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/9120", "page_rank": 1.2134723e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "The Pulitzer Prizes | The <em>ObamaCare</em> crossroads", "snippet": "But if the year-long debate over <em>ObamaCare</em> has proven anything, it <em>is</em> that Americans want no such thing.

Everyone is preoccupied now with the politics, but ultimately at stake on Sunday is the kind of country America will be.\nThe consequences of this bill will not only be destructive for the health-care system and the country's fiscal condition, though those will be bad enough. Inextricably bound up in a plan as far-reaching and ambitious as ObamaCare are also larger questions about the role of government, the dynamism of American enterprise and the nature of a free society. Above anything else, this explains why Democrats have had such trouble convincing the public, let alone their own Members.\nMost acutely in the balance is the future of U.S. medicine. On the opposing page we reprint a 1996 essay by the great Milton Friedman that is more relevant than ever. Drawing from Alexander Solzhenitsyn's novel \"The Cancer Ward,\" the late Nobel laureate traces the ways that national health care fundamentally alters \"the consensual relation between the patient and the physician.\"\nGetty Images\nIn our world of infinite wants but finite resources, there are only two ways to allocate any good or service: either through prices and the choices of millions of individuals, or through central government planning and political discretion. This choice is inexorable. Stripped of its romantic illusions, ObamaCare is really about who commands the country's medical resources. It vastly accelerates the march toward a totally state-driven system, in contrast to reforms that would fix today's distorted status quo by putting consumers in control.\nFriedman lays out how the country arrived at our current pass, starting with the World War II-era decision to offer tax subsidies for employer-sponsored coverage only. Like the company store, this inefficient and inequitable preference encourages workers to be paid in kind rather than cash, and over the years the third-party payer system it entrenched has inhibited competition and desensitized patients to the costs of their own care. With the 1965 creation of Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor, government has come to play the leading role in shaping the way care is paid for and provided.\nNaturally, the result has been high and rising costs. Since 1962, the share of the economy devoted to health care has risen to about 17% from 6%. Today, health entitlements account for about 5% of GDP but on current trend will rise to 7% in 2025 and about 15% in 2062.\nThat is the problem President Obama inherited, as it were. Yet rather than fundamentally changing these incentives, he chose instead to create a new middle-class insurance entitlement that will transform the way U.S. health care is financed, and thus delivered. Such a \"universal\" system has been the core liberal aspiration since the age of Bismarck. But time and again this political ambition has been thwarted by American individualism, distrust of government power, the checks and balances of the political system, and, every so often, good judgment in Washington.\nOnce the health-care markets are put through Mr. Obama's de facto nationalization, costs will further explode. The Congressional Budget Office estimates ObamaCare will cost taxpayers $200 billion per year when fully implemented and grow annually at 8%, even under low-ball assumptions. Soon the public will reach its taxing limit, and then something will have to give on the care side. In short, medicine will be rationed by politics, no doubt with the same subtlety and wisdom as Congress's final madcap dash toward 216 votes.\nAs in the Western European and Canadian welfare states, doctors, hospitals and insurance companies will over time become public utilities. Government will set the cost-minded priorities and determine what kinds of treatment options patients are allowed to receive. Medicare's price controls will be exported to the remnants of the private sector.\nAll bureaucratized systems also restrict access to specialists and surgeries, leading to shortages and delays of months or years. This will be especially the case for the elderly and grievously ill, and for innovation in procedures, technologies and pharmaceuticals.\nEventually, quality and choice\u2014the best attributes of American medicine in spite of its dysfunctions\u2014will severely decline.\nDemocrats deny this reality, but government rationing will become inevitable given that overall federal spending is already at 25% of GDP and heading north, and Medicare's unfunded liabilities are roughly two and a half times larger than the entire U.S. economy in 2008. The ObamaCare bill already contains one of the largest tax increases outside the Great Depression or the world wars, including a major new tax on investment income\u2014and no one seriously believes it will be enough.\nSo a vote for ObamaCare is also a vote against the vitality of American capitalism. Business elites have mostly held their tongues, or calculated that they can later dump their health-care liabilities on the government. Yet ObamaCare will lead to much higher levels of taxation across society. The tax wedge\u2014the share of labor costs that never reaches workers but instead goes straight to government\u2014will start flying towards the 50% that prevails today in most of Europe. In America, without the same welfare state obligations, it hovers near 30%.\nA self-governing democracy can of course decide that it wants to become this kind of super-welfare state. But if the year-long debate over ObamaCare has proven anything, it is that Americans want no such thing. There is no polling majority or any bipartisan support, much less a rough national consensus, for this expansion of government power. The election of Scott Brown in Massachusetts for Ted Kennedy's seat, of all things, was as direct a referendum as you could have.\nSo if the health bill passes in the House, it will only do so the way it did in the Senate, with a narrow partisan majority, abetted by political bribery and intimidation, budget gimmicks and procedural deceptions. An entitlement the country can't afford and doesn't want may pass because of sheer ideological willfulness. The ugliness of the bill, and of its passage, means that some or all of it might be repealable, but far better not to make the tragic mistake in the first place.\n\u00a9\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\n"}, {"score": 996.9215, "uuid": "28389d2b-5e9a-5d9e-b3e2-e0a9fcf55866", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1201tw-00-00493", "target_hostname": "audio.wrko.com", "target_uri": "http://audio.wrko.com/a/53771420/joshua-archambault-on-obamacare.htm", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Joshua Archambault on <em>Obamacare</em>", "snippet": "Nobody expects <em>any</em> of them to consider <em>any</em> thing but that what ever came out of the Obama administration <em>is</em> <em>is</em> fine.

Welcome to Obamacare!\nI said and survey is gonna be wary and you know what Sarah Palin brought the idea of death panels. As soon as you have. Government bureaucrats who -- sitting far away making decisions about who's\nAutomatically Generated Transcript (may not be 100% accurate)\nI -- I was I was you know when you go down in front of the Supreme Court elect to seal the signs like to hear the argument see the folks that are camping out overnight today. Heard about a gentleman that had been camping out three days before the hearings in order to try to be one of the 400 or so who went inside you that's correct and first and did he get Indian -- he did he did the -- the other hottest ticket was tired they are paying 600 dollars for a line -- for so if you look at for some good money you're in the sentinel -- So the Supreme Court doing their share tomorrow and turning up on climate -- Huh. Hot or you lawyer are you coming from a policy perspective on this time coming from a policy perspective my background so worked on Beacon Hill have a master's in public policy so I'd like to say that I went back to school. Can get a lot of grief but I have one year less of debt that to payoff so you have a perspective a legal perspective -- sent out certainly from a policy in the legislative perspective understanding how to laws are written in how to get implemented in and looking at the economics of it may be a lawyer. Doesn't have quite all that robust way to look at it but that's where I'm coming from Josh we -- we're told -- in the.\nPresidential debates -- the tenth amendment to the power of the states can do this so Mitt Romney makes a very clear distinction we -- to Romney care Massachusetts any state can do whatever it wants because it has that power. Inherent in its in it in its foundational documents. But the federal government can't do this now the left seems to me to be a little scattered after the three days of hearings and maybe a little bit worried about you know things that are gonna happen now they're -- how are how to -- might break what's your take after three days and you -- Listening to the arguments back and forth as you bring -- healthcare knowledge to have to bear on this.\nYeah I think congress exactly right really thrilling questions and very probing questions from justices on both the last in the right. I think the folks on the left actually have a legitimate reason to be concerned with the how strong arguments were I think that the government's. Lawyer who might have done them a little distrust descending -- to defend the individual mandate so. If I was a betting man I would say 7080% chance that the individual mandate does go down I do think they're not gonna repeal the entire lot into a -- leave the Medicaid. Expansion on because that has weakest argument against it. Average do you think that that this could certainly shake up the presidential race coming up.\nWell help me understand the weakness -- of the Medicaid argument so let's just stay with Massachusetts anytime anytime number of times over the -- A number he has -- signed up and expanded the Medicaid program and goes 5050 whatever the share is going to be. Now comes -- along comes Obama camp. And they force an expansion upon the states and say well we're gonna do this but if you don't go along with this new chapter in our relationship. Everything how she did. It is just went you know it's the whole let's take an program the -- not a -- stop funding our -- how is out of it how is that not. Coercive how I feel that this is a voluntary consensual. Mutual arrangement to one now -- yet in the living daylights pummeled bottoming.\nWhy don't necessarily disagree with the I'm not sure that justices feel that way but you don't know what gives you that impression because the from the discussion I heard. They sounded as upset with that notion as they did with the rest of why do you think the folks justice Sotomayor and -- and -- the Medicaid expansion actually is a great deal for states away -- the four leftists are devout. Nobody expects any of them to consider any thing but that what ever came out of the Obama administration is is fine. It doing ordering you may be surprised an individual mandate justice Sotomayor. Is specifically ask some very probing questions than -- crystal plus I use me Josh credibility questions what do you think the chances are in a while those I'm liberal justices. Goes with the constitution over the Obama administration and a half. Meeting question I think there yes you know I I I think. You'd be surprised. The level of a decision making some of these folks have made on past cases that you think there's a chance one of them will go against obamacare while liberals I'm not gonna put money down on it but I do think that you know it allows them to look a little bit more fair if they uphold certain provisions. I think they -- something along the lines of we don't think that this is the best public policy we think congress should go back in and fix it. Any day they could leave themselves a rundown allow congress to go back -- mean find it unconstitutional. They could it I think I think we be surprised by writing.\nHeck I'm out of it differ -- much smarter and name know this stuff better. But I think these people are ideologues and that the four leftists on the court will remain leftist even though they can look at the constitution and no. Every aspect of the slots patently unconstitutional for what it does to the country. But then it did the only people were flexible. I think this is funny because I was -- and my mother the other day who only gets her information through liberal prisons and all of her friends are liberal former professors so. All of it comes from context and she says do you agree. That the the court that the justices who are on the -- called conservatives then they're totally inflexible and none of them would ever consider voting the wrong way out and and I said no it's a matter of fact the reason there's a conversation here is because they're two of the five conservatives who could vote the other way. The people or inflexible. Are the four liberals it's impossible that many of them would vote to. To throw out the slot but you disagrees.\nI could give us an example for example of one of the surprising question you got from some of my -- I think she just have followed the line of Iraq questioning that some of the conservative justices have a on the individual mandate I'm not saying that she will rule that way I think there's a possibility. If I -- one of the more left leaning judges I would put her in that camp. Now with that being said before the case started a lot of folks -- Justice Scalia and Roberts could -- potential swing -- along with -- definitely -- to -- based on previous rulings especially first only on -- marijuana case so -- I just think that you know while we see the questioning and we hear it and everybody speculates based on the line of reasoning -- actually comes time to write -- opinions and and vote who knows -- a little -- no you're right but most -- servers were shocked at the vehemence with which the conservative side. Came out and was who was peppering with questions in that original statement. That Justice Kennedy made it work he said you're you're you're talking about. Changing in traumatic substantial ways the relationship between the government in the individual citizen. And that kind of stuff and everybody didn't I think it did and it was encouraging to those of us that think the federal laws unconstitutional however later in that hearing and again this is somewhat. The difficulty of not having media being able to report real time is that later and that same day -- Justice Kennedy ask questions they gave some court observers some questions about whether he really felt like. He's gonna vote against into the drama and it ultimately I think he will. I think -- a vote to overturn it for a variety of reasons. But I just think we need to be careful listen to the whole argument or -- no question and -- trying to gases is falsely except for those I think who aren't. Who know the nuance of it enough to know that this feels different than usual in today's articles so we we learn in this is how would I know -- on the US at the Massachusetts -- JC. They will vote on this today. They vote on and then the reasoning the review standards are not yet so yeah they're going to be in and out of there now and we probably vote no because -- that he would never really leaks out in terms of what the result is but we are going to know I'm curious Josh. You mentioned Beacon Hill and public -- you know pop. Health care policy is gonna have been you you you world experience. Do you think Romney -- is constitutional. Under the Massachusetts constitution and -- you know sorrow if so. Or what revisions. Authorized. I actually think that there's no question it is constitutional given. -- police powers that are given to these states. Their action this actually has been tested there was a lawsuit against the department of revenue Massachusetts. Challenging the individual mandate and the penalty and they have got they ruled against individual that suit and simply said look the federal government has and -- is in the state government has this power. It's not an unreasonable. Fee or penalty which we have SaaS and therefore we will not overturn a result --\nI heard Howard Dean talking yesterday and he was saying it's so stupid that they have this mandated in their because is no need for the mandate the rest along would be fine without the mandate. And I was confused by that he didn't explain. How that could be because we know that the idea of the mandate is to force people who don't want or need insurance from their perspective like young people college I never. I never have for a in my twenties I never had a health care policies in -- full time job which might have been -- low thirties forties like. -- Unemployed and unemployable pop pop pop pop up. -- Why it was I I just I don't yet how you could create the -- for not forcing everybody who doesn't use the system. To buy health care how do you pay for everybody having health care I think governor dean wants -- to work towards a single Payer system anyways and it's a public option. But does that argument make any sense because the president when he was campaigning against Hillary. Her plan had the mandate he has didn't he argued against it in was he got to pay for.\nIt's a very good question I think governor dean here's trying to make. -- and I've bad it's a good situation out of a very bad one for him I think he wants to justify the rest a lot to go back and look at his earlier comments. When this debate was happening he was very much pushing for -- public option saying this is absolutely necessary to really get to them the direction we want to move in this country so. I'm not sure I agree with him I don't understand how to financing would work out unless they assess somebody else to take more money out of Medicare or something like that too harsh harsher.\nus from the pioneer institute a local think tank and he is the director of health care policy there. We're talking about health care and their new book yet pioneer the great experiment the states the feds in your health care. Stay tuned for more Thomas Todd WRKO.\nGood -- not WR. Yeah and Josh Josh -- is I guess he's been held he had good. At the pride every institute so you've done the book at the pioneer the great experiment the states -- beds and your health -- The purpose of the book the findings the conclusions what's going on good morning guys have a plan alive yes sure -- the -- actions before.\nPurposes the first one is three wanted to put one place what happened in Massachusetts what was discussed what was -- out -- implementation as one data and it's all about. Where we are now what is it actually look like who helped give us quickie on that are they did -- how do you think Romney -- worked out -- So first I wanna say it important anyways issue because Patrick care because Governor Patrick as they implement has been largely responsible for it's a week document in the book at least six or seven different ways in which the law has differed. Implementation from what was actually pastor what was the understanding OK estimated. That from just a high level take away it actually depends on who you war so if you're an individual purchase insurance you've benefited greatly from the reform your premiums have gone down. You're small business you actually happened benefited all that much after Prius mania gone up slightly because of the reform. If you were -- at large company you are impacted by the reform how about the stayed on a macro level terms of cost of has the you know some people say it's at a couple billion dollars to the state budget tells what the financial impact so -- From our -- understanding and pulling apart the budget data it looks like the status of out on par with where I thought it would be spending line is the big difference and take -- has been the federal government has filled the gap. They've become much more is the federal government giving -- slot that's a little hard to tell him we try to pull it apart in the book but now. Due to the stimulus money and all that sort of things if you wanna pull apart and what is. What portion as the federal government picked up you know we're looking at somewhere between. Guy you know couple billion dollars actually -- federal government has put into the reform because it's extra Medicaid money -- stimulus and on them because in the qualitative terms as opposed to quantitative because it's difficult to measure. We have been they have given us a lifeline -- a -- substantial financial crutches to make it look as if it works is at an overstatement eyes slightly only because -- stimulus gave Medicaid money to every state. So we need to put a little bit context dying you know -- in the national setting here that because -- downturn things that tend to have cost or is it not possible -- if you two did to pull the numbers apart and say how much more this is costing so it's much easier to tell you how much the state has paid and that's in the book like you're saying that's basically where they thought they're going to be. Paying for insurance or Medicaid currently says the state spending about 373 million dollars this past year on reform directly tied to expansions and reform. So I mean in the grand scheme of things by 2526. -- mean dollar budget that's on them myTouch ram but there was no we can't answer whether it's the mass of the state Massachusetts's. -- Beat substantially more like the couple billion you're talking about that's against number so we know we can say how much the state is paying it's a little bit harder to -- are much the federal government aid and that's about it because I don't respect gets out of the federal government Sox -- them money we were gonna have to start -- so that's where it's important -- know the answer is absolutely true we -- a from a very high level we just haven't been able -- as as deep as we want to. But just -- clinic and a second part of the book is we what we wanted to do for a number -- experts together including the dean of our medical scored a couple folks from DC to think about. How'd you reset the relationship between the states -- government health reform so we basically in essence lay out a blueprint of how you move forward here. And I think very timely given Supreme Court hearings and -- a lot does it. And you know repealed or struck down at some portion -- lay out a number of different policy proposals that we think the country shouldn't torts are well adapted so we. What's the best case just give us one planned. For health care. So we we compared to the last entitlement reform happen in the mid nineties which is welfare reform. The best way to go about doing major reform across the whole country's for the federal government to. Authorized waivers and courage waivers and sent out the policy goals that we wanted to reach so you -- back to doing it covers would be. You'd take the Medicaid money but you don't have to follow the Medicaid rules come up with your -- correct that we there's great accountability there just like -- health care we say here's our eventual goal going to more folks off Medicaid into private insurance. Yeah yeah oddities of the goals that we -- reached he's got great flexibility to get their the other one is doing with this pre existing condition issue came up multiple times during the federal debate. We look at the best estimates that's two to four million folks in our country. Have really only becomes an issue when you change jobs or you move states so we want to state based high risk pools to be able to get those folks are pretty -- you're saying roughly 1% of Americans have a pre existing -- going to be that few. So it's heated political debate here right so. -- You're looking at some are about 4500 dollars per person so all you would have to do is do what they do and car insurance in Massachusetts which is say ever insurer has to take their fair share. Of these people lower cost you a lot of money you can tune him up even have that federal government paid for and that's or advocate for a -- if you do the estimates are looking somewhere between fifteen to twenty billion dollars a year they can pre existing. Condition issue. Price over ten years 150 to 200 billion dollars. As a much different stories and Democrats than a trillion plus a live their dream for twenty billion dollars before we get that Democrats don't want the thing for them yeah I -- and a half hot dogs not even hot hot hot. I wanna ask a question about emergency room utilization. One of the theories of Romney care obamacare is she we get all these people clog an opt in if they just at basic insurance that would not happen and yet the statistics the year of the show. That people keep showing up in the same number is still overwhelming emergency rooms in the most expensive way. Usually the most inappropriate place to get treated how come. That issue has not been solved by either Romney Kia. You know what will be a -- question I think this is an example -- academic theory meets reality. Everybody stop when the reform passed. This is game once -- insurance credit stop showing up to emergency room that has not happened. However there's a slight silver lining here which is the percent increase in visits to emergency room have plateaued the last few years so that's. Why would anybody think it emerges or restore 24. Why would you stop on -- 24 because somebody says you know use the supermarket. That's stupid well in theory typically have to pay more to show up to emergency room and you went to have to go to regular doctors hope it would be different amount you -- at issue here is we didn't fully understand how hard it is to change behavior lifestyles -- or even -- could be other reasons here and that's definitely needs more research but. Maybe folks -- just an emergency room -- their job schedule but can't simply make an appointment during the day because their work.\nPeople are under a lot of stress if you lower socioeconomic -- in -- more stress yet. And one more -- subway ride or what have you missed an hour work a couple of hours can be tough especially in down economy I think this is a broader discussion too and our state we moved a little bit in the direction allowing minute clinics. Think we need -- the legislature needs to move forward with a lot of different reforms to allow our health care system that much more flexible and accommodating -- I -- volatile time we -- all got our -- dog yeah -- to have you back and do more help yourself if your -- happy to do some good stuff John Harris -- a pioneer institute. They've got a book out called the great experiment the states the -- in your health care which basically he's just given us an overview. Is an outline of how to solve the health care problem in America coming up Jeff -- joins us for.

Here are five tax-related ways seniors will get soaked.\nTuesday, March 20th, 2012\nNext week, the Supreme Court will be asked to decide if the Federal Government can compel private citizens to buy stuff.\nThe court will hear arguments for and against Obamacare, and freedom-loving Americans from coast-to-coast and around the globe are hoping the answer will be a rousing and decisive \u201cNO.\u201d\nAmong the many, many reasons why all Americans should vigorously oppose Obamacare is that it will financially devastate many seniors, thanks to some taxes that traitors-to-freedom Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid made sure were in the bloated bill nobody could read until they voted for it.\nGrover Norquist, the President of\u00a0 Americans for Tax Reform wrote a short Op/Ed that outlines the five most serious tax consequences for America\u2019s seniors if Obamacare is not overturned.\nThe five tax hikes in Obamacare that most hurt seniors\nThe jobs-killing Obamacare law contains 20 new or higher taxes on American families and employers. Many of these tax increases fall on families making less than $250,000 \u2014 a direct violation of candidate Obama\u2019s promise not to raise \u201cany form\u201d of taxes on these families. In less than a week, the third anniversary of Obamacare being signed into law will take place. The Supreme Court will be hearing oral arguments about the constitutionality of Obamacare next week.\nOut of the 20 new or higher taxes in Obamacare, there are five that fall most directly on seniors.\nThe first is the excise tax penalty for failure to comply with Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate. Many seniors face a coverage gap between retirement and Medicare eligibility. Obamacare raises taxes on these younger seniors by punishing them if they don\u2019t purchase \u201cqualifying health insurance.\u201d Set to go into effect in 2014, the excise tax penalty for mandate non-compliance will in 2016 rise to 2.5% of adjusted gross income for a senior couple (or $1,390 for those making less than $55,600).\nObamacare will leave many seniors counting pennies...if they're lucky.\nWhy does Obamacare raise taxes on seniors just as they are entering retirement? Many of these seniors will face this \u201cstick\u201d but find themselves with too much income to qualify for the \u201ccarrot\u201d of tax credits to purchase Obamacare health insurance plans in an exchange. Many will be forced to keep working just to avoid paying this tax.\nThe second tax hike on seniors is the so-called \u201cCadillac Plan\u201d excise tax. Starting in 2018, Obamacare imposes a whopping 40% excise tax on high-cost (\u201cCadillac plan\u201d) health insurance plans. This is defined for seniors as a plan whose premiums exceed $29,450 for a family plan, or $11,500 for a single senior. Seniors often face higher costs in health insurance premiums due to chronic health conditions and other risk factors. This tax will fall almost exclusively on the seniors with the greatest health insurance needs.\nThird is Obamacare\u2019s dividends tax hike. Starting in 2013, the top tax rate on dividends is scheduled to rise from 15% today to 39.6%. In addition, Obamacare imposes a dividend \u201csurtax\u201d of 3.8% on families making more than $250,000 per year. That would create a top dividend tax rate of 43.4%, nearly triple today\u2019s rate. This will fall very hard on seniors. According to the Tax Foundation\u2019s analysis of IRS data, 70% of households over age 55 receive dividend income. Seventy-one percent of all dividends paid flow to these households. To raise taxes on dividends is to raise taxes on seniors.\nThen there\u2019s the medical device excise tax. Obamacare imposes a new excise tax on medical device manufacturers in 2013. These companies will surely build the cost of this new tax into the price of what they sell. Who buys medical devices? Who buys pacemakers, wheelchairs and other costly medical devices? Seniors do.\nFinally, Obamacare reduces allowable medical itemized deductions. Under current law, medical itemized deductions can be claimed on tax returns, but they must be reduced by 7.5% of adjusted gross income. Obamacare increases this \u201chaircut\u201d to 10% of AGI in 2013. This will mean that millions of Americans claiming medical itemized deductions will no longer be able to. The same IRS data as above tells us that 60% of all tax filers claiming this deduction are over age 55.\nAll of the tax increases in Obamacare will hurt seniors, but these five fall on them directly and hardest.\nDid Obama and his henchmen set out to deliberately penalize seniors for getting old? Or were they just too stupid or blinded by ideology to recognize the consequences of what they foisted upon America? Did it occur to them that not all seniors with dividend income are wealthy, that some simply live comfortably in retirement and others just scrape by even with their dividends and that confiscating forty percent of it might make the difference between eating three meals a day and two\u2026or one?\nIt took 232 years for the nation to elect a president arrogant enough to presume he is not just another inexperienced, megalomaniacal politician, but some kind of royalty who doesn\u2019t lead the nation but rules it.\nWhether the Supreme Court decides according to the Constitution, as the Founders intended, or further twists and rips it to squeeze out another fantastical, never-before-noticed government power, we still have one more chance to save the nation come November.

In fact, he notes, what is traditionally thought of as \"the government\" (what he characterizes as \"Everything Else\" besides Social Security, Medicare and interest on the debt) is not getting bigger as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product:\nIn 1960 , the last full year of the Eisenhower administration, taxes were 17.8 percent of GDP and primary spending (excluding interest) was 16.4 percent. Social Security took in and paid out 2.2 percent. Medicare didn't exist. So Everything Else had a primary surplus, with taxes at 15.6 percent and spending at 14.2 percent.\nIn 2010, in the supposed age of \"big government,\" spending on Everything Else was only 14.7 percent of GDP, and that was swollen by the recession and stimulus spending. By 2021, according to the CBO's alternative fiscal scenario (the pessimistic one), spending on Everything Else will be 13.0 percent--less than in 1960. Everything Else tax revenues--that is, everything except the Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes--will be 12.5 percent of GDP, for a primary deficit of only 0.5 percent. And that's assuming that all of the 2001, 2003, and 2009 tax cuts are extended indefinitely.\nTo solve our long-term deficit and debt problems, we've got to figure out how much of a safety net in terms of Social Security and Medicare we're willing to purchase as a society. If instead, we put most of the focus on starving traditional federal programs and agencies, we'll not only fail to address our fiscal problems, but we'll end up with hollowed-out, dysfunctional bureaucracies that further erode Americans' faith in government.\n"}, {"score": 974.68115, "uuid": "0c749ec7-e419-566e-9ea3-d7bd5c939c81", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0814wb-95-02575", "target_hostname": "readersupportednews.org", "target_uri": "http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/272-39/8753-bomb-buried-in-obamacare-explodes-hallelujah", "page_rank": 1.2577395e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "Bomb Buried in <em>Obamacare</em> Explodes - Hallelujah!", "snippet": "This <em>is</em> the true \u2018bomb&#x27; contained in <em>Obamacare</em> and the one item that will have more impact on the future of how medical care <em>is</em> paid for in this country <em>than</em> anything we&#x27;ve seen in quite some time.", "explanation": null, "document": "Ungar writes: 'If you thought that the Obama Administration chickened out on pushing the nation in the direction of universal health care for everyone, today is the day you begin to understand that the reality is quite the contrary.\"\nPresident Obama signed major healthcare legislation into law, 03/23/10. (photo: Doug Mills/NYT)\nBomb Buried in Obamacare Explodes - Hallelujah!\nBy Rick Ungar, Forbes\n05 December 11\nThe 'time-bomb' Ungar refers to actually 'exploded' on December 2nd, the day this piece first appeared on Forbes. However, Ungar's point is not only still relevant, but the 'bomb' has been widely ignored by the mainstream media. -- JPS/RSN\nhave long argued that the impact of the Affordable Care Act is not nearly as big of a deal as opponents would have you believe. At the end of the day, the law is - in the main - little more than a successful effort to put an end to some of the more egregious health insurer abuses while creating an environment that should bring more Americans into programs that will give them at least some of the health care coverage they need.\nThere is, however, one notable exception - and it's one that should have a long lasting and powerful impact on the future of health care in our country.\nThat would be the provision of the law, called the medical loss ratio, that requires health insurance companies to spend 80% of the consumers' premium dollars they collect - 85% for large group insurers - on actual medical care rather than overhead, marketing expenses and profit. Failure on the part of insurers to meet this requirement will result in the insurers having to send their customers a rebate check representing the amount in which they underspend on actual medical care.\nThis is the true \u2018bomb' contained in Obamacare and the one item that will have more impact on the future of how medical care is paid for in this country than anything we've seen in quite some time. Indeed, it is this aspect of the law that represents the true \u2018death panel' found in Obamacare - but not one that is going to lead to the death of American consumers. Rather, the medical loss ratio will, ultimately, lead to the death of large parts of the private, for-profit health insurance industry.\nWhy? Because there is absolutely no way for-profit health insurers are going to be able to learn how to get by and still make a profit while being forced to spend at least 80 percent of their receipts providing their customers with the coverage for which they paid. If they could, we likely would never have seen the extraordinary efforts made by these companies to avoid paying benefits to their customers at the very moment they need it the most.\nToday, that bomb goes off.\nToday, the Department of Health & Human Services issues the rules of what insurer expenditures will - and will not - qualify as a medical expense for purposes of meeting the requirement.\nAs it turns out, HHS isn't screwing around. They actually mean to see to it that the insurance companies spend what they should taking care of their customers.\nHere's an example: For months, health insurance brokers and salespeople have been lobbying to have the commissions they earn for selling an insurer's program to consumers be included as a \u2018medical expense' for purposes of the rules. HHS has, today, given them the official thumbs down, as well they should have. Selling me a health insurance policy is simply not the same as providing me with the medical care I am entitled to under the policy. Sales is clearly an overhead cost in any business and had HHS included this as a medical cost, it would have signaled that they are not at all serious about enforcing the concept of the medical loss ratio.\nSo, can private health insurance companies manage to make a profit when they actually have to spend premium receipts taking care of their customers' health needs as promised?\nNot a chance - and they know it. Indeed, we are already seeing the parent companies who own these insurance operations fleeing into other types of investments. They know what we should all know - we are now on an inescapable path to a single-payer system for most Americans and thank goodness for it.\nWhether you are a believer in the benefits of single-payer health coverage or an opponent, mark this day down on your calendar because this is the day seismic shifts in our health care system finally get under way.\nIf you thought that the Obama Administration chickened out on pushing the nation in the direction of universal health care for everyone, today is the day you begin to understand that the reality is quite the contrary.\nIf you believe that the end of private, for-profit health insurance is some type of nefarious step towards a socialist society, then you might want to attend church this Sunday to mourn the loss of health insurers being able to worm out of covering the bills of a cancer patient because she forgot to write down on her application that she had skin acne for three months when she was a teenager.\nOf course, those of you who fear the inevitable arrival of universal health care really shouldn't be too fretful. There will always be a for - profit health insurance industry for those who want to pay for it. The only difference will be that those who cannot afford private coverage will also have an opportunity to get their families the medical care that they need.\nEveryone wins - except the for-profit health insurers.\nI can live with that.\n"}, {"score": 974.5222, "uuid": "9b040de4-c9bd-58b7-a0e7-e28cb84a19c7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1805wb-01-26500", "target_hostname": "www.healthreformscam.com", "target_uri": "http://www.healthreformscam.com/2009/08/31/dirty-secret-4-in-obamacare/", "page_rank": 1.1994443e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Health Reform Scam \u00bb Dirty Secret #4 in <em>ObamaCare</em>", "snippet": "This <em>is</em> dirty secret No. 4 in <em>Obamacare</em> that our government isn\u2019t telling you: <em>Obamacare</em> <em>is</em> ultimately designed to force retiring baby boomers into a much cheaper version of socialized medicine <em>than</em> <em>Medicare</em>, which <em>is</em> already being positioned to be cut to the tune of $500 billion.", "explanation": null, "document": "Posted from World Net Daily\nBy Chuck Norris \u2013\u00c2\u00a0Flying under the radar last week was a new government report that forecasts that the national debt will double over the next decade. The White House has projected a cumulative $9 trillion deficit between 2010 and 2019, while the Congressional Budget Office estimates a more optimistic $7.1 trillion based upon the expiration of Bush tax cuts. What this means is that Washington\u2019s out-of-control spending will likely turn the nation\u2019s already-staggering $11 trillion debt into an astronomical $20 trillion.\nBut there are at least two ginormous expenses that are excluded in these projections. First, both projections from the White House and CBO incorporate their belief that the deficit will decline quickly over the next three years, as they assume less bailouts are needed and the economy rapidly grows. But isn\u2019t there also the real possibility that the economy will not recover as quickly as they hope? Every additional bailout or stimulus (large or small), and every margin of error in their three-year prospective climb-out of the economic pit, will inflate our nation\u2019s debt balloon even more.\nThe second expense is far less speculative \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it has to do with about one-fourth of America. The 72 million baby boomers (people born in America from 1946 to 1964, excluding immigrants), the largest generation America has produced, are going into retirement over the next two decades and will face the golden years of declining health and rising medical costs. Under current law, if the government were to add the projected baby boomer costs of Medicare and Social Security to its debt tab, it would send deficit projections into the abyss.\nHere\u2019s the primary problem: Medicare is bankrupt. Medicaid is bankrupt. And Social Security is bankrupt. Though boomers have paid into these programs via their taxes for decades, there are not enough benefits to offer them, now and even less in the future. The problem is compounded when one understands that the number of people in the United States ages 65 and older is expected to double by 2030, and so is the amount expected to fund their retirement and health care in their twilight years, which relatively few are prepared to handle themselves.\nSo what is the U.S. government to do, especially when it is already projected to have a $20 trillion dollar debt in 2019 (let alone what it will be in 2030)?\nThat reform is needed in health care is not a question, mostly because Americans are being raped by the insurance companies. But Obamacare in its present form is not the answer, because it will progressively cut (yes, cut) the care for baby boomers in the future, if not through the reductions and costs of private options then through the mandatory benefit cuts the government has to make in Social Security and Obamacare (former Medicare). Think about it. If government can\u2019t handle the costs of the elderly now in retirement via its Medicare and Social Security programs, do we really expect they will offer the baby boomer better (and more costly) benefits in the future?\nThe government knows that, with any version of a public option in health care, it is impossible for them to assist the baby boomer generation the way they assist their parents\u2019 generation right now. Do the math. It\u2019s impossible, in any form \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not without the biggest tax increases ever levied upon the American people. This Washington knows: It must cut the benefits of Medicare and Social Security, otherwise the government itself will go bankrupt trying to offer those programs to the boomers over the next two decades. For a little inside peak into the Washington corridors on this issue, consider the following.\u00c2\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s own report , \u201cThe U.S. Retirement System and the Baby-Boom Generation,\u201d \u201cPresent trends are unlikely to persist indefinitely, however, because total payments to retirees are expected to grow much faster under current law than either the total incomes of workers who pay Social Security and Medicare taxes or the revenues earmarked for those programs. That widening gap will place increasing stress on both programs. Narrowing the gap could involve slowing the future growth of benefits.\u201d\nNotice the words \u201cunder current law\u201d and \u201cslowing the future growth of benefits\u201d? That is key. The only way around this future financial dilemma (at least according to this administration) is to change \u201ccurrent law\u201d and to \u201cslow\u201d or lower the benefits for baby boomers. That new law (or basic legislation upon which such changes can be amended) is Obamacare. Are we so gullible to believe that the CBO\u2019s report on baby boomers has no interplay with Obamacare legislation?\nLook closely at the carefully stated italicized words (emphasis mine) within the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s political strategy found within that same boomer report: \u201cThe extent to which baby boomers are providing for their own retirement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and have time to react to policy changes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is thus an important consideration in evaluating proposals to reform the Social Security and Medicare programs.\u201d The only way the boomers will \u201chave time to react to policy changes\u201d is if they are enacted before they go into retirement! (Are you catching another reason for the White House\u2019s rush to pass this legislation?!)\nThis is dirty secret No. 4 in Obamacare that our government isn\u2019t telling you: Obamacare is ultimately designed to force retiring baby boomers into a much cheaper version of socialized medicine than Medicare, which is already being positioned to be cut to the tune of $500 billion . Obamacare is not merely about reforming health care to aid 47 million Americans who are uninsured. It is about reforming \u201ccurrent law\u201d to ax 72 million retiring Americans who the government can\u2019t afford to support over the next two decades.\nNow you know why President Obama and recently White House budget director Peter Orszag both declared that health-care reform is \u201c central \u201d to economic recovery. Many have wondered how or why they can say that. They aren\u2019t saying so because the government is expanding medical coverage or because it will cost them a trillion more dollars to socialize medicine. They are saying that because offering 72 million baby boomers less Social Security and Medicare benefits (via Obamacare) will save the government trillions over the next couple decades.\nConsider the fact that we\u2019re already feeling the birth pains of this generational catastrophe: For the first time in Social Security\u2019s history last week, Social Security checks are projected to freeze or be cut in 2010, 2011 and even 2012 . In fact, according to Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala. , another bailout could be imminent for Social Security.\nCut Social Security checks?! Let me get this straight. Corporations are given Washington bailouts. Society is infused with government stimuli. Consumers and car lots are given cash for clunkers. And the elderly, who will undoubtedly bear the brunt end of disproportionate medical costs and coverage merely because of their age, are experiencing an economic freeze already from the administration that promises not to cut their future benefits? Sounds to me that health-care rationing has already begun via Social Security!\nBottom line: Washington believes it must control spending on retirement and health benefits before millions of baby boomers retire, and Obamacare is the ticket to accomplish that objective. As Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, D-N.D. , said, \u201cToday\u2019s budget numbers send a clear signal that the time for putting off tough choices is over and the time to act is now.\u201d But wouldn\u2019t you like to know if those \u201ctough choices\u201d had to do with your future health care?\nAgain, friends, Washington\u2019s whole covert plan can be summed up and seen in these words from the CBO report on baby boomers: \u201cUnder current law \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 slowing the future growth of benefits \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 have time to react to policy changes.\u201d\nI\u2019ll say it one last time: Before so-called universal health care turns into your universal hell-care, write or call your representatives today and protest their rushing and voting Obamacare into law. Remind them what is needed in Washington is a truly bipartisan group that is allowed ample amount of time to work on compromised health-care law that reigns in out-of-control insurance companies and doesn\u2019t raise taxes (for anyone), regulate personal medical choices, ration health care or restrict American citizens\u2019 freedoms in any way.\nMy last four columns (outlining the four dirty secrets of Obamacare) are more than enough reason to kill this present so-called health-care legislation and send our politicians back to the drawing boards. That is why I\u2019m sending my congressman this message that I also encourage you to send yours: \u201cIf you vote in Obamacare, I\u2019ll fight to vote you out of office!\u201d\nRead Dirty Secret #1 , Dirty Secret #2 , Dirty Secret #3\nThis entry was posted on Monday, August 31st, 2009 at 7:46 am and is filed under Dirty Secret .

Once again, all the strategies by the Administration and its liberal allies involve how better to message this hated law as the anniversary of its passage approaches and the Supreme Court hears oral arguments on its constitutionality. If only the Administration put this much effort into lowering the price of gas or creating jobs.\nThe memo identifies the White House\u2019s target audience \u2014 seniors, women, and young adults \u2014 with a goal of \u201cincreas[ing] overall public support for the law by making the benefits of the law (and consequences of taking those benefits away) tangible by featuring stories of real people impacted.\u201d The effort will focus on two key issues:\n\u201cRemind people that the law is already benefiting millions of Americans by providing health care coverage, reducing costs and providing access to healthcare coverage. This message will include the ideas that these are benefits that politicans/the Court art (sic) are trying to take away from average Americans.\u201d\n\u201cFrame the Supreme Court oral arguments in terms of real people and real benefits that would be lost if the law were overturned. While lawyers will be talking about the individual responsibility piece of the law and the legal precedence, organizations on the ground should continue to focus on these more tangible results of the law.\u201d\nThe White House and its allies have a lot of persuading to do. The American people have come to their own conclusion about Obamacare \u2014 the law was a serious mistake, and it\u2019s time for it to go.\nPolling data shows the extent of the opposition. Fifty-three percent of Americans favor repeal , more than half of Americans say that the Supreme Court should strike down the mandate, 57 percent believe religious-affiliated employers should be exempt from the law\u2019s anti-conscience mandate, 51 percent support a religious and moral exemption for all employers, and 60 percent of physicians believe the law will have a negative impact on overall patient care.\nThere\u2019s good reason for their opposition. The latest news of Obamacare\u2019s impact came from a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report released this week. In one of the CBO\u2019s reported scenarios , 20 million Americans could lose their employer-sponsored health benefits, and 49 million more Americans could become dependent on government-sponsored health care. And it won\u2019t come cheaply for American taxpayers. Projecting through 2022, Obamacare could cost as much as $2.134 trillion, and individual and employer mandate penalties could hit $221 billion.\nThen there\u2019s the issue of the unconstitutional individual mandate that forces Americans to buy government dictated health insurance or pay a penalty, as well as\u00a0the anti-conscience mandate that religious employers, including schools, hospitals, and charities, must provide abortion-inducing drugs and contraception despite the fact that such services totally contradict many of these groups\u2019 core religious beliefs.\nUnder Obamacare, costs will go up, people will lose the coverage they have, and quality of care will decline. Individuals and businesses will face penalties, seniors will feel the effects of Obamacare\u2019s cuts to Medicare, doctors will suffer from increased regulation and lower government reimbursement for services, taxpayers will face new taxes, jobs will be lost, millions of Americans will remain uninsured and stuck in overcrowded emergency rooms, religious institutions and the faithful will suffer the loss of their religious liberties, and future generations will pay the costs.\nThat\u2019s not the message you\u2019ll see and hear next week as the White House and its supporters descend on Washington and take to the airwaves in defense of Obamacare. But as much as they\u2019d like to portray their efforts as a grassroots groundswell in defense of the President\u2019s law, we know that it\u2019s a highly coordinated effort to preserve an unconstitutional affront to the American people.\nQuick Hits:\nNorth Korea plans to launch a satellite in mid-April , its first such effort in three years. Many see the launch as a test of the country\u2019s missile technology.\n"}, {"score": 973.0689, "uuid": "93dc87bb-d1da-5ddc-8864-99be26f82ace", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0606wb-38-03041", "target_hostname": "www.okieonthelam.com", "target_uri": "http://www.okieonthelam.com/category/obamacare-nightmares/", "page_rank": 1.3794318e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "<em>Obamacare</em> Nightmares | &#x27;Okie&#x27; on the Lam", "snippet": "Consider what <em>is</em> going to happen if we fail . .

Consider the Obamacare promise to have the government cover everyone who is uncoverable. The program began a little more than a year ago. The promise was this would cost taxpayers \u201conly\u201d $13,026 a year per enrollee.\nThe actual cost is more than double the price promised by President Obama.\n\u201cEach participant is expected to average $28,994 in medical costs in 2012, according to the report, more than double what government-contracted actuaries predicted in November 2010,\u201d the Washington Post reported.\nThe spin from the White House is cynical and dishonest.\n\u201cThe Obama administration says that the high cost of PCIP patients shows that the high-risk pools are serving the exact population it hoped to target: Americans with significant health-care needs who previously could not afford coverage,\u201d the Washington Post reported. \u201cIt\u2019s also a result of how the federal government structured the high-risk pools.\u201d\nThe government is selling something well below cost. That is a great bargain for everyone except the taxpayer \u2014 and barely half the nation now is one of those people.\n\u201cEnrollees in the plan tend to use health-care services at much higher rates than the general population, the report said. They have more than eight times as many hospital admissions as government workers in a traditional Federal Employee Health Benefits plan, and more than three times as many emergency room visits,\u201d the Washington Post reported.\nEmergency room visits do not necessarily mean emergencies. As we have seen with Medicaid, which covers the poor, emergency rooms are used by the poor for routine health problems as well as emergencies because there is no benefit to the person on Medicaid to schedule and appointment like normal people do. In fact it is more convenient to show up at the ER for routine treatment.\nI will allow that people with pre-existing conditions are more likely to have emergency situations than everyone else. But people with pre-existing conditions also learn to manage their ailment in such a way as to avoid life-threatening situations where the paramedics roll them into ER at 3 a.m.\nThis government screw-up may not last long at the government level. Democrats and President Obama have ordered health insurance companies to cover people who have pre-existing conditions that would cost more to cover than premiums will bring in. The costs will be passed on to the rest of us, who will be ordered to obtain health insurance coverage.\nThe Washington Post report , used with permission:\nMedical costs for enrollees in the health-care law\u2019s high-risk insurance pools are expected to more than double initial predictions, the Obama administration said Thursday in a report on the new program.\nThe health-care law set aside $5 billion for a Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, meant to provide health insurance to those who had been declined coverage by private carriers. Since its launch last summer, nearly 50,000 Americans have enrolled in the program.\nThe PCIP program will phase out in 2014, when insurers will be required to accept all applicants regardless of their health-care status.\nThose who have enrolled in the program are projected to have significantly higher medical costs than the government initially expected. Each participant is expected to average $28,994 in medical costs in 2012, according to the report, more than double what government-contracted actuaries predicted in November 2010. Then, the analysts expected that the program would cost $13,026 per enrollee.\nThe costs also are significantly higher than those of similar high-risk pools that many states have operated for decades. States spent an average of $12,471 on enrollees in 2008, according to the National Association of State Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans.\nThe Obama administration has spent $600 million of its $5 billion budget for the program over the past 18 months. More than three-quarters of all spending has gone to covering cancer, heart disease, \u201caftercare\u201d such as chemotherapy and degenerative joint diseases like osteoarthritis.\nEnrollees in the plan tend to use health-care services at much higher rates than the general population, the report said. They have more than eight times as many hospital admissions as government workers in a traditional Federal Employee Health Benefits plan, and more than three times as many emergency room visits.\nThe Obama administration says that the high cost of PCIP patients shows that the high-risk pools are serving the exact population it hoped to target: Americans with significant health-care needs who previously could not afford coverage. It\u2019s also a result of how the federal government structured the high-risk pools.\n\u201cWe certainly have seen higher costs than what you have seen in some of the state-run programs,\u201d said Steve Larsen, director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO). \u201cThere are design features that are different in the federal program than in state-run programs.\u201d\nLarsen cited the federal requirement that an individual must be uninsured for at least six months to become eligible for the plan. Such enrollees may have \u201cpent up medical demands,\u201d he said, that had gone untreated until the individuals enrolled in the new, federal coverage.\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re enrolled you can begin chemotherapy the first day of your coverage,\u201d said Richard Popper, deputy director of insurance programs at CCIIO. \u201cWe had individuals who enrolled and in their very first week went into surgery.\u201d\nEnrollees in the high-risk pools also tend to be older, with 67 percent of participants over the age of 45. Fewer than one in five enrollees are under 34.\n"}, {"score": 969.13434, "uuid": "5547a7e6-3aa9-5e7b-993d-36569c1ec006", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1201tw-28-05415", "target_hostname": "blogs.dailymail.com", "target_uri": "http://blogs.dailymail.com/donsurber/archives/53562", "page_rank": 1.2442676e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "5 stages of <em>Obamacare</em> \u00ab Don Surber", "snippet": "That <em>is</em> my (somewhat contrarian) position on <em>Medicare</em> and Medicaid.", "explanation": null, "document": "5 stages of Obamacare\nMarch 31, 2012 by Don Surber\nTwo years ago, liberals rammed an unconstitutional health insurance bill \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 through Congress without a Republican vote. They libeled opponents as racists and touted a new age in Washington. James Carville said Democrats would rule for 40 years. But the public hated the law and voted Democrats out of the House. Now the Supreme Court will vote 6-3 to nullify this unconstitutional attack on our liberty.\nThe spin from Democrats is hilarious. The liberals will go through them all: Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.\nFirst, denial.\nFrom the Associated Press:\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Joe Biden says he\u2019s confident the Supreme Court will uphold the constitutionality of the health care law.\nBiden says in an interview taped for CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that \u201cwe think the mandate and the law are constitutional and we think the court will rule that way.\u201d\nAsked about the chances it would be overturned, he replies, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it will happen.\u201d Biden says \u201cI think we should focus on what is the law doing for people now and what would happen if Republicans should repeal it.\u201d\nBiden has started taking on a greater role in arguing President Barack Obama\u2019s case for re-election, making an appearance on his behalf in the Midwest earlier this week. Excerpts of his Sunday interview were aired Friday on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d\nJoe Biden is paid to say crazy stuff. Not so the bloggers at Huffington Post.\nFrom David Paul :\nI believe that the Supreme Court will uphold the individual mandate that is at the core of Obamacare by a vote of 6-3. Based on no legal theory whatsoever, I expect Chief Justice Roberts and perennial swing vote Justice Kennedy to vote with the liberal wing to uphold the act of Congress.\nDenial takes many shapes. There is denial that striking down the centerpiece of the Obama presidency is toxic. It actually helps him.\nFrom Bob Shrum :\nWill a Tea Party Supreme Court guarantee Obama a second term?\nThe court\u2019s conservative wing appears ready to engage in some despicable judicial activism on ObamaCare. Politically, at least, the justices are doing Obama a favor.\nIt is strategy like that which made Bob Shrum presidential poison. He\u2019s been on the losing end of, what, 5 presidential candidates now?\nMore from Bob Shrum:\nLargely missing from the coverage of the health reform case are the most important consequences of nullifying the law: The tragedy of tens of millions who would again be left without insurance; the plight of young adults now on their parents\u2019 policies who would be thrown off; the desperation of those with pre-existing conditions who would be left with no coverage and nowhere to turn; the agony of patients who, because of lifetime limits on their insurance, would see it canceled just before the next round of chemotherapy.\nTens of millions were covered by Obamacare? He\u2019s nuts! There are 7 million more uninsured Americans than there were 2 years ago. Liberals now live on Fantasy Island. Joining him is Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman. He\u2019s in denial that this is a liberal plan.\nFrom Paul Krugman :\nIndeed, conservatives used to like the idea of required purchases as an alternative to taxes, which is why the idea for the mandate originally came not from liberals but from the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation. (By the way, another pet conservative project \u2014 private accounts to replace Social Security \u2014 relies on, yes, mandatory contributions from individuals.)\nWait a second, doesn\u2019t that mean liberals opposed the mandate at some point? Ah another diversion. Well-played, Krugman, well-played.\nThen comes anger.\nFrom Jonathan Cohn :\nVirtually everybody agrees that a vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act would be five to four\u2014a bare majority. And it would be a bare partisan majority, with the five Republican appointees overruling the four Democratic appointees. The decision would appear nakedly partisan and utterly devoid of principle. Appearances would not be deceiving.\nReally? So he admits that Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, Kagan and Sotomayor are just political hacks\u2026\nThen there is bargaining. Then there is the smiley face that ridding us of Obamacare clears the way for the government taking over all of health care.\nFrom Eugene Robinson :\nIf Obamacare is struck down, the short-term implications are uncertain. Conservatives may be buoyed by an election-year victory; progressives may be energized by a ruling that looks more political than substantive. The long-term consequences, however, are obvious: Sooner or later, a much more far-reaching overhaul of the health-care system will be inevitable.\nNever mind that the decision would strike Obamacare down because Congress is not empowered to run health care insurance. In liberal landthis passes for logic.\nMore from Eugene Robinson:\nBut it\u2019s going to be a close call. What if they strike down the law?\nThe immediate impact will be the human toll. More than 30 million uninsured Americans who would have obtained coverage under Obamacare will be bereft. Other provisions of the law, such as forbidding insurance companies to deny coverage based on preexisting conditions and allowing young adults to remain on their parents\u2019 policies, presumably would also be invalidated; if not, they would have to be modified to keep insurance rates from climbing sharply. The United States would remain the only wealthy industrialized country where getting sick can mean going bankrupt.\nEventually, however, our health-care system will be restructured. It has to be. The current fee-for-service paradigm, with doctors and hospitals being paid through for-profit insurance companies, is needlessly inefficient and ruinously expensive.\nLet us see, before Obamacare, we had 44 million uninsured Americans. Now we have 51 million. He says we will have 30 million uninsured if this goes down. Sounds like a deal.\nAs for \u201cfor profit,\u201d isn\u2019t that what his employer, the Washington Post, is supposed to be? A free press is a right. Using his logic, the Washington Post should eschew all profits and he should work for free.\nGroupthink is alive and kicking at the Washington Post.\nFrom Ezra Klein :\nWith health-care reform either repealed or overturned, both Democrats and Republicans shy away from proposing any big changes to the health-care system for the next decade or so. But with continued increases in the cost of health insurance and a steady erosion in employer-based coverage, Democrats begin dipping their toes in the water with a strategy based around incremental expansions of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. They move these policies through budget reconciliation, where they can be passed with 51 votes in the Senate, and, over time, this leads to more and more Americans being covered through public insurance. Eventually, we end up with something close to a single-payer system, as a majority of Americans \u2014 and particularly a majority of Americans who have significant health risks \u2014 are covered by the government.\nThe key word there is \u201ceventually.\u201d This is a long, ugly process that ensures a very large uninsured population for decades. It\u2019s also a process that ensures there won\u2019t be a coordinated effort to control costs for sometime. Yes, it might end up with a system that\u2019s tilted further towards public insurance than what\u2019s envisioned in the Affordable Care Act. But it\u2019s not at all obvious it would be a good system, and, in the decades between here and there, there will be a lot of unnecessary suffering and deaths among the uninsured. That\u2019s the real cost of losing this opportunity to insure 30 million people. And it\u2019s a cost that too often gets swept under the rug in Washington\u2019s handicapping of the political fallout.\nNext will come depression. Probably beginning on November 7, 2012. But acceptance? Never. Liberals will spend the next century laying the blame for every medical problem on the justices who struck down Obamacare. They\u2019re still angry at Ronald Reagan for his testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee 60 years ago.\n"}, {"score": 971.0504, "uuid": "7246f08c-42d6-5c92-838f-3dbf2750150e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1000tw-94-09931", "target_hostname": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "target_uri": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dean-baker/medicare-costs-too-much-a_b_1363673.html", "page_rank": 1.1760701e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Dean Baker: <em>Medicare</em> Costs Too Much and They <em>Better</em> Not Cut It", "snippet": "What&#x27;s striking <em>is</em> the Republican alternative.

But if you thought that was the case, you would be wrong.\nThe latest Republican crusade on Medicare is to eliminate the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which was put in place as part of the health care reform bill passed two years ago. IPAB is empowered to impose a cap on Medicare spending if it grows too fast relative to the size of economy. The way it would reduce cost growth is by reducing or eliminating payments for medicines and procedures that have not been shown to be effective.\nThe idea that Medicare would not pay for some medicines or procedures has Republicans in Congress screaming about \"death panels\" and \"rationing.\" It is fascinating how Republicans use these terms. These politicians, who like to portray themselves as lovers of free markets, are now claiming that it is rationing if the government will not pay for something.\nWe have to keep our eye on the ball. No one is telling people that they can't spend their own money on any medical care they like. The issue is simply what care Medicare will pay for. Under current law the IPAB may impose constraints that stop the government from paying for care that has not been shown to be effective.

While they scream bloody murder over any effort to constrain costs in Medicare, their own plan is to simply end Medicare as we know it.

As anyone who has dealt with insurance knows, insurers have procedures they cover and those they don't. In Republican terminology, each plan has its own \"death panel\" that decides what procedures are covered.\nFurthermore, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), based on extensive experience with private sector insurers who already operate in the Medicare system through Medicare Advantage, projects that private insurers will hugely increase the cost of getting Medicare-equivalent policies. This is both due to the fact that private insurers have much higher administrative expenses than the public Medicare system and also that they are less effective in containing costs.\nWorking off CBO projections, my colleague David Rosnick calculated that the Ryan plan would increase the cost of buying Medicare equivalent policies by $34 trillion (in 2011 dollars) over the program's 75-year planning horizon. In short, if people are worried that IPAB is going to make some procedures unaffordable for some people, then they should want to run as far as possible from Representative Ryan and his fellow Republicans. Their plan will leave beneficiaries far less able to afford care than anything that the IPAB might do.\nWhen people look at these long-term projections of exploding health care costs there are two important factors they should keep in mind. First, costs in the United States are ridiculously out of line with the rest of the world. We spend more than twice as much per person on health care as the average in other wealthy countries even though we have little to show for it in the way of outcomes.\nIf our health care costs were comparable to costs in Germany, Canada or anywhere else we would be looking at huge long-term budget surpluses , not deficits. This also suggests one simple way of controlling costs: Let Medicare beneficiaries buy into the health care systems of other countries, splitting the enormous savings with the government. If the Republicans really supported free markets, they would be all for that one.\nThe other point worth noting is that health care cost growth actually has slowed hugely in the last two years. We can't know whether this slowdown will continue, but if it does, IPAB will not have to do anything to meet its cost targets.\nWe desperately need an overhaul of our health care system, which is a cesspool of inefficiency and corruption. However, in keeping with their desire for larger portions of poison, the Republicans want to dismantle Medicare, which is by far the most efficient part of the national health care system.

The Congressional committee charged with drafting legislation on reform is scheduled to start voting on Wednesday. President Obama made a major speech outlining his intentions to the American Medical Association, which has come out in opposition to important aspects of his proposed reforms, especially the so-called \u201cpublic option.\u201d And the Congressional Budget Office, the agency charged with reviewing the budgetary implications of proposed legislation, released a study on the likely outcomes of the leading Democratic plan. It wasn\u2019t pretty.\nAs a report in the New York Times made clear, the administration\u2019s \u201creform\u201d proposals fail to do what any sort of legitimate reform should have as its two central goals: cost containment and universal coverage. The CBO estimates that establishing the Obama plan would cost a staggering $1 trillion over ten years, and would only cover a net total of 16 million people who currently lack insurance, leaving 36 million people uninsured by 2017.\nSome Democrats have proposed introducing taxes on soft drinks and a value-added tax in order to raise the funds necessary to pay for the plan. But why spend an additional $1 trillion when we already spend far more on healthcare than every other industrialized country, with inferior health outcomes? Why resort to labyrinthine legislative schemes that don\u2019t even accomplish the president\u2019s stated goals for healthcare reform? The answers to these questions are obvious, of course. The private health insurance industry and the doctors\u2019 lobby want to sabotage any effort at serious reform, and they have lined the pockets of politicians in both parties (including President Obama) to ensure that single-payer, or at least a legitimate public option that can possibly lead the way to single-payer, remains off the agenda. And Obama\u2019s healthcare proposals once again point up the deeply conservative nature of his conciliatory approach to politics. The private insurers can\u2019t be \u201cbrought to the table.\u201d They must disappear, and the only way to do that is through the mobilization of public opinion (which clearly supports single-payer) and through conflict, something that Obama seems congenitally allergic to.\nIt\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that any sort of healthcare \u201creform\u201d that comes out of Congress this year is going to be so mutilated by the corporate-dominated legislative process that we\u2019ll wind up with a healthcare system that\u2019s even worse than the one that we have now.

The first declares, \"the food in this place is poison.\" His friend agrees and adds, \"and the portions are so small.\" This exchange perfectly captures the Republican approach to Medicare.\nThe Republicans, led by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, have argued that Medicare threatens to bankrupt the country. They have pointed to cost projections showing the program more than doubling relative to the size of the economy over the next three decades. The Republicans say that the country cannot afford this expense and scream about huge debt burdens for our children.\nThe Republicans' concern might lead people to believe that they would support measures to contain Medicare costs. But if you thought that was the case, you would be wrong.\nThe latest Republican crusade on Medicare is to eliminate the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which was put in place as part of the health care reform bill passed two years ago. IPAB is empowered to impose a cap on Medicare spending if it grows too fast relative to the size of economy. The way it would reduce cost growth is by reducing or eliminating payments for medicines and procedures that have not been shown to be effective.\nThe idea that Medicare would not pay for some medicines or procedures has Republicans in Congress screaming about \"death panels\" and \"rationing.\" It is fascinating how Republicans use these terms. These politicians, who like to portray themselves as lovers of free markets, are now claiming that it is rationing if the government will not pay for something.\nWe have to keep our eye on the ball. No one is telling people that they can't spend their own money on any medical care they like. The issue is simply what care Medicare will pay for. Under current law the IPAB may impose constraints that stop the government from paying for care that has not been shown to be effective. Only in some bizzaro world can this be called rationing.\nWhat's striking is the Republican alternative. While they scream bloody murder over any effort to constrain costs in Medicare, their own plan is to simply end Medicare as we know it. The plan approved by the Republican House last year would end Medicare as a publicly run system. It would instead give beneficiaries a voucher that they could use to buy insurance in the private market.\nUnder the Republican plan there is absolutely no guarantee that beneficiaries would be able to purchase plans that cover the services that IPAB might exclude from Medicare coverage. As anyone who has dealt with insurance knows, insurers have procedures they cover and those they don't. In Republican terminology, each plan has its own \"death panel\" that decides what procedures are covered.\nFurthermore, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), based on extensive experience with private sector insurers who already operate in the Medicare system through Medicare Advantage, projects that private insurers will hugely increase the cost of getting Medicare-equivalent policies. This is both due to the fact that private insurers have much higher administrative expenses than the public Medicare system and also that they are less effective in containing costs.\nWorking off CBO projections, my colleague David Rosnick calculated that the Ryan plan would increase the cost of buying Medicare equivalent policies by $34 trillion (in 2011 dollars) over the program's 75-year planning horizon. In short, if people are worried that IPAB is going to make some procedures unaffordable for some people, then they should want to run as far as possible from Representative Ryan and his fellow Republicans. Their plan will leave beneficiaries far less able to afford care than anything that the IPAB might do.\nWhen people look at these long-term projections of exploding health care costs there are two important factors they should keep in mind. First, costs in the United States are ridiculously out of line with the rest of the world. We spend more than twice as much per person on health care as the average in other wealthy countries even though we have little to show for it in the way of outcomes.\nIf our health care costs were comparable to costs in Germany, Canada or anywhere else we would be looking at huge long-term budget surpluses , not deficits. This also suggests one simple way of controlling costs: Let Medicare beneficiaries buy into the health care systems of other countries, splitting the enormous savings with the government. If the Republicans really supported free markets, they would be all for that one.\nThe other point worth noting is that health care cost growth actually has slowed hugely in the last two years. We can't know whether this slowdown will continue, but if it does, IPAB will not have to do anything to meet its cost targets.\nWe desperately need an overhaul of our health care system, which is a cesspool of inefficiency and corruption. However, in keeping with their desire for larger portions of poison, the Republicans want to dismantle Medicare, which is by far the most efficient part of the national health care system. Instead they want to hand over even more of our money to a badly broken private health care system.\nFollow Dean Baker on Twitter: www.twitter.com/DeanBaker13\n"}, {"score": 963.23663, "uuid": "f48eed8d-7ba5-58f7-82fe-bfe4d76ccea0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1316wb-21-19416", "target_hostname": "blog.pfaw.org", "target_uri": "http://blog.pfaw.org/category/topics/medicare", "page_rank": 1.3278485e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>medicare</em> | blog.pfaw.org", "snippet": "He has said that &quot;if <em>Obamacare</em> <em>is</em> actually implemented,&quot; then &quot;America as we know it will be no more.&quot; Today, after he announced his candidacy, Santorum declared that American troops at D-Day had been fighting for Rep.

In Minnesota, the government has shut down over Republican refusal to raise taxes on the fewer than 8,000 people making over $1 million. On the national level, Republicans are refusing to even consider raising revenue, threatening to let the U.S. default on its debt. But what about everyday Americans? Even with the influence of the anti-tax Tea Party, Americans strongly support raising taxes in order to decrease the deficit and reduce income inequality, as 19 polls taken since the beginning of the year show. Bruce Braley has the rundown:\nA June 9 Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 61 percent of people believe higher taxes will be necessary to reduce the deficit.\nA June 7 Pew poll found strong support for tax increases to reduce the deficit; 67 percent of people favor raising the wage cap for Social Security taxes, 66 percent raising income tax rates on those making more than $250,000, and 62 percent favor limiting tax deductions for large corporations. A plurality of people would also limit the mortgage interest deduction.\nA May 26 Lake Research poll of Colorado voters found that they support higher taxes on the rich to shore-up Social Security\u2019s finances by a 44 percent to 25 percent margin.\nA May 13 Bloomberg poll found that only one third of people believe it is possible to substantially reduce the budget deficit without higher taxes; two thirds do not.\nA May 12 Ipsos/Reuters poll found that three-fifths of people would support higher taxes to reduce the deficit.\nA May 4 Quinnipiac poll found that people favor raising taxes on those making more than $250,000 to reduce the deficit by a 69 percent to 28 percent margin.\nAn April 29 Gallup poll found that only 20 percent of people believe the budget deficit should be reduced only by cutting spending; 76 percent say that higher taxes must play a role.\nAn April 25 USC/Los Angeles Times poll of Californians found that by about a 2-to-1 margin voters favor raising taxes to deal with the state\u2019s budget problems over cutting spending alone.\nAn April 22 New York Times/CBS News poll found that 72 percent of people favor raising taxes on the rich to reduce the deficit. It also found that 66 percent of people believe tax increases will be necessary to reduce the deficit versus 19 percent who believe spending cuts alone are sufficient.\nAn April 20 Washington Post/ABC News poll found that by a 2-to-1 margin people favor a combination of higher taxes and spending cuts over spending cuts alone to reduce the deficit. It also found that 72 percent of people favor raising taxes on the rich to reduce the deficit and it is far and away the most popular deficit reduction measure.\nAn April 20 Public Religion Research Institute poll found that by a 2-to-1 margin, people believe that the wealthy should pay more taxes than the poor or middle class. Also, 62 percent of people believe that growing inequality of wealth is a serious problem.\nAn April 18 McClatchy-Marist poll found that voters support higher taxes on the rich to reduce the deficit by a 2-to-1 margin, including 45 percent of self-identified Tea Party members.\nAn April 18 Gallup poll found that 67 percent of people do not believe that corporations pay their fair share of taxes, and 59 percent believe that the rich do not pay their fair share.\nOn April 1, Tulchin Research released a poll showing that voters in California overwhelmingly support higher taxes on the rich to deal with the state\u2019s budgetary problems.\nA March 15 ABC News/Washington Post poll found that only 31 percent of voters publican policy of only cutting spending to reduce the deficit; 64 percent believe higher taxes will also be necessary.\nA March 2 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 81 percent of people would support a surtax on millionaires to help reduce the budget deficit, and 68 percent would support eliminating the Bush tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000.\nA February 15 CBS News poll found that only 49 percent of people believe that reducing the deficit will require cuts in programs that benefit them; 41 percent do not. Also, only 37 percent of people believe that reducing the deficit will require higher taxes on them; 59 percent do not.\nA January 20 CBS News/New York Times poll found that close to two-thirds of people would rather raise taxes than cut benefits for Social Security or Medicare in order to stabilize their finances. The poll also found that if taxes must be raised, 33 percent would favor a national sales tax, 32 percent would support restricting the mortgage interest deduction, 12 percent would raise the gasoline taxes, and 10 percent would tax health care benefits.\nOn January 3, a 60 Minutes/Vanity Fair poll found that 61 percent of people would rather raise taxes on the rich to balance the budget than cut defense, Social Security or Medicare.\nh/t Teagan Goddard\nPFAW\nHuntsman Polishes His Magic Mirror to Show GOP Voters Whatever They're Looking For\nTue, 06/21/2011 - 3:46pm \u2014 Michael Keegan\nJust who is Jon Huntsman? At this stage, he is whatever anyone hopes that he will be. As he prepares to officially join the gaggle of GOP presidential candidates, his campaign strategists seem to have adopted an \"all-things-to-all-people\" approach: play up his conservative credentials for Republican primary voters while courting general election voters by promoting his media image as the only moderate in the race. A CNN commentator, for example, calls him \"the lone standard-bearer of the center-right in a crowded GOP field.\" Katrina Trinko, a reporter at the conservative National Review Online, sees this all-things-to-all-people approach as a potentially winning strategy:\nIt remains to be seen whether Jon Huntsman can successfully be all things to all men. But if, by stressing different parts of his record, he can successfully sell himself as a moderate to centrists and a conservative to hard-liners, he could be difficult to beat.\nAn analysis of Huntsman's record shows that, faced with the reality that he must appeal to the increasingly far right Republican base, he is quickly trying to jettison formerly held \"moderate\" positions. We agree with Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who has publicly rejected the notion that Huntsman is a RINO (Republican in Name Only), saying \"there's no question he's a conservative.\"\nIt's worth noting that many Americans first met Huntsman when he introduced \"my friend Sarah\" Palin at the 2008 Republican National Convention, exulting that \"history will be made tonight!\" He praised her strength, tenacity, authenticity and originality, calling her a rebel and a renegade who is \"not afraid to kick a few fannies and raise a little hell.\" Said Huntsman, \"We are looking for a beacon of light to show us the way. We are looking for Sarah!\"\nHuntsman and the Religious Right: Ralph Reed's 'Great Friend'\nThere are plenty of reasons that former Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed recently introduced Huntsman to a group of right-wing activists as \"a good conservative and a great friend.\"\nIn 2009, Huntsman told a reporter that he has little patience for traditional \"culture war\" issues, saying \"I'm not good at playing those games.\" That sounds like a promising and refreshing break from the norm of Republican presidential candidates, but in reality he has played those \"games\" devastatingly well. He made his efforts to make abortion completely unavailable to women a centerpiece of his address to Reed's \"Faith and Freedom Coalition\" summit:\n\"As governor of Utah, I supported and signed every pro-life bill that came to my desk,\" he said. \"I signed the bill that made second-trimester abortions illegal and increased the penalty for doing so. I signed the bill to allow women to know about the pain an abortion causes an unborn child. I signed the bill requiring parental permission for an abortion. I signed the bill that would trigger a ban on abortions in Utah if Roe v. Wade were overturned.\"\nHuntsman has also appealed to the public school-hating wing of the Religious Right. In 2007, he signed a statewide school voucher bill that provided up to $3,000 in taxpayer funds for students attending private schools. That was too much even for voters in conservative Republican Utah, who rejected the attack on public education and overturned the plan through a referendum.\nAt Reed's recent confab, Huntsman also joined the chorus of speakers warning Tea Party conservatives not to abandon social conservatives. The Republican Party, he said, should not focus on economics to the detriment of the fight to make abortion unavailable, saying that would lead to \"a deficit of the heart and soul.\"\nHuntsman and the Economic Right: A Full Embrace of the Ryan Budget\nHuntsman, who is making his tax-cutting record as governor of Utah a major campaign theme, has praised Rep. Paul Ryan's radical budget proposal as a \"very, very good one.\" Even though Republicans have been abandoning the Ryan plan in droves, Huntsman has said that he would have voted for the Ryan budget if he were a member of Congress. He has specifically embraced the Ryan budget's plan to essentially abolish Medicare, saying the size of the national debt required drastic policy changes. However, unlike some other Republican governors, Huntsman's concerns about the debt did not prevent him from welcoming federal stimulus funds.\nHe embraces the Tea Party's warnings about the economy and the suggestion that the nation is being destroyed by internal enemies. He says that America is \"buying serfdom\" with its deficit spending. Invoking Ronald Reagan's 1964 \"A Time for Choosing\" speech on behalf of Barry Goldwater, Huntsman says America is at a crossroads, with voters needing to choose \"whether we are to become a declining power in the world, eaten from within, or a nation that regains its economic health and maintains its long-loved liberties.\"\nAs governor, Huntsman proposed abolishing corporate taxes altogether; campaigning in New Hampshire recently, he suggested that he would cut federal corporate taxes. The 2012 campaign, he says , will determine whether the nation will endure an economic \"lost decade\" or \"unleash the economic magic.\"\nMoving Right on Climate Change\nThis month the Salt Lake Tribune examined Huntsman's shift on climate issues. Four years ago, he supported a regional cap-and-trade program, saying, \"If we do this right, our citizens are going to have a better quality of life, we're going to spawn new technologies and industries, and we're going to leave our most important belongings in better shape for the next generation.\" That was then, as the paper noted:\nBut now, in a political environment rocked by recession and a rowdy tea party, and with Huntsman's eyes on a possible presidential run in 2012, his position has evolved. He's still defending the science of climate change, but he has ditched his support for cap-and-trade.\nGiven that most of the GOP field is in full denial on climate change, Huntsman has gotten some credit for simply acknowledging reality. \"All I know is 90 percent of the scientists say climate change is occurring,\" he told TIME magazine. \"If 90 percent of the oncological community said something was causing cancer, we'd listen to them.\" But, he says, now \"isn't the moment\" to deal with climate change.\nThat led the Washington Monthly's Steve Benen to comment :\nThis is, in general, the worst of all possible positions. Much of the right believes climate change is a \"hoax\" and an elaborate conspiracy cooked up by communists to destroy America's way of life. These deniers have a simple solution to the problem: ignore it and pretend there is no problem. Much of the left takes the evidence seriously, is eager to address the crisis, and has a variety of possible solutions to the problem, including but not limited to cap-and-trade plans.\nHuntsman apparently wants to split the difference -- he accepts the evidence and believes the problem is real; Huntsman just doesn't want to do anything about it.\nTo borrow his analogy, Huntsman has heard the collective judgment of 90% of the world's oncologists, but believes it'd be inconvenient to deal with the cancer or what's causing the cancer anytime soon.\nModerate Image, Conservative Reality\nHuntsman's moderate image is based in large part on his 2009 endorsement of civil unions for gay couples. Five years earlier, when campaigning for governor, he had supported a state constitutional amendment that bans marriage and \"other domestic unions\" for same-sex couples. Huntsman's rhetorical shift did not find its way into any policy that offers legal protection for gay couples in Utah; he still opposes marriage equality, calling himself \"a firm believer in the traditional construct of marriage, a man and a woman.\"\nHuntsman has taken some heat from far-right activists who cannot tolerate the slightest sign of heresy against right-wing dogma. But former George W. Bush official Michael Gerson thinks Huntsman's moderate media image could actually help him by setting initial expectations low among GOP activists:\nThe media have often covered Huntsman as a liberal Republican -- a Rockefeller reincarnation. After all, he supports civil unions. He made it easier to get a drink at a bar in Utah. This easy press narrative gives Huntsman an odd advantage in a Republican primary: He is more conservative than his image. For many Republicans, he will improve upon closer inspection.\nHuntsman's campaign is just getting under way, but his positioning is already clear. Tell Religious Right activists you're one of them by emphasizing your support for the most draconian anti-choice measures. Tell the Tea Partiers you're one of them by backing Paul Ryan's radically anti-government and anti-middle-class budget. And encourage more moderate Republicans to believe you're one of them by calling for civil discourse and offering rhetorical support for short-of-equality measures for same-sex couples. It's a calculated strategy that might make some sense politically, but it seems unlikely that trying to be all things to all people provides a path to victory through the restrictive gauntlet of the Republican primaries.\nCross posted on The Huffington Post\nPFAW\nRick Santorum: The Hapless Holy Warrior Starts Another Crusade\nWed, 06/08/2011 - 1:00am \u2014 Michael Keegan\nFormer Senator Rick Santorum formally launched his bid for the White House today. Given that Santorum's last run for reelection resulted in a crushing 17-point defeat, and given that his poll numbers are still in the low single digits in spite of his having been running a de facto campaign for the past year and a half, it would seem that Santorum's race is mostly a sign of the self-deceiving wishful thinking that overtakes people who believe they are meant to be president -- or in Santorum's case, who believe God truly wants them to be president.\nIndeed, Santorum's campaign has already won him enough mockery that Pittsburgh Post-Gazette columnist Tony Norman recently dubbed him \"the Rodney Dangerfield of American politics,\" saying he gets \"as little respect as support.\"\nPart of Santorum's problem is simply that he comes across to many people as annoyingly self-righteous. Norman writes , \"His biggest problem is that he reminds everyone, including Republicans, of the annoying kid in Sunday school who memorizes all 66 books of the Bible so he can recite them in reverse order for the old ladies at church.\" In 2009, as Santorum's plans to run were becoming more apparent, journalist Matthew Cooper wrote , \"My favorite Santorum anecdote actually comes from Bob Kerrey. After Santorum denounced Sen. Mark Hatfield, the Oregon Republican, for his opposition to the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, the Nebraska Democrat was asked what he thought. 'Santorum, that's Latin for a--hole.'\"\nFans on the Far Right\nIn spite of Santorum's huge negatives, he has his cheerleaders among right-wing activists and pundits who think he could still emerge from the unimpressive GOP pack.\nLast month, right-wing Catholic activist Keith Fournier published a column that was essentially a mash note , declaring Santorum the winner of the South Carolina debate, calling his demeanor \"Kennedy-esque,\" and gushing that Santorum's \"courage to lead\" is \"what this Nation needs.\"\nIn February, columnist George Will praised Santorum as a \"relentless ethicist\" and said the GOP needs someone who can energize social conservatives who \"are feeling neglected and are looking for someone like Santorum.\" To those who thought his loss would make him unelectable, Will asks, \"Well, was Richard Nixon defunct after losing the California gubernatorial race in 1962?\" I wonder if Santorum welcomed that comparison.\nIn January, when Santorum was criticized for slamming Obama's support for abortion in racial terms -- saying, \"I find it almost remarkable for a black man to say 'now we are going to decide who are people and who are not people'\" -- The National Review's Kathryn Jean Lopez praised Santorum for raising the issue of abortion in the black community.\nThe Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody also praised Santorum back in January, before Brody's crush on Donald Trump burst into full flower.\nLove him or hate him, let's be clear about Rick Santorum. He doesn't hold back. He doesn't mince words and conservative Christians and Catholics find this quality to be his best attribute. If and when he dives into the 2012 GOP mosh pit, he's going to be the guy that won't hold back and in the process he'll put some of these other 2012 contenders on the spot by bringing up issues that everybody whispers about but rarely talks about in public.\nHard Right Record\nSantorum's far-right rhetoric and policy positions are what keep hope alive among some of his supporters. He is campaigning as a hard-right candidate who can appeal to every stripe of conservative. And he certainly has the record to back up that claim.\nSpeaking to a Tea Party gathering in February, Santorum embraced an extreme view of the constitutional separation of powers and the role of the federal judiciary, reportedly saying that Congress has the power and the right to declare what is constitutional or not. He said Congress has the power to disband the federal courts and that \"I would sign a bill tomorrow to eliminate the 9th Circuit [Court of Appeals]. That court is rogue. It's a pox on the western part of our country.\" He told the Conservative Political Action Conference in February that \"America belongs to God\" and the judiciary has no right to \"redefine\" life or marriage.\nHe's a fierce critic of federal health care reform legislation, saying it will \"destroy the country,\" portraying it as the equivalent of drug dealing and telling a group of Christians that getting hooked on health care would make them \"less than what God created you to be.\" He has said that \"if Obamacare is actually implemented,\" then \"America as we know it will be no more.\"\nToday, after he announced his candidacy, Santorum declared that American troops at D-Day had been fighting for Rep. Paul Ryan's plan to effectively end Medicare. \"Those Americans risked everything so they could make that decision on their health care plan,\" he said .\nHe pushes the Tea Party's small-government ideology, saying the problems in the housing industry will be resolved by \"getting regulators to back off\" and letting the markets work their magic. Similarly, he says the answer to creating jobs is to get rid of all the government intervention that he believes is strangling businesses -- health care reform, financial regulation, the Environmental Protection Agency, and more.\nIn a bid to salvage his sinking 2006 reelection campaign, Santorum turned to bashing immigration reform and \"amnesty\" for illegal immigrants.\nSantorum has a social issues record to make the Religious Right cheer. He made a name for himself on the national scene with his attacks on gay rights, most notably in a 2003 interview comparing gay relationships with \"man-on-dog\" sex. (In the same interview he argued that the Constitution does not protect a right to privacy. Recently he said that allowing loving gay couples to adopt children is \"trying to defy nature\" and should be illegal, as should gay marriage. He says that the Obama administration's decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act in federal court meant that the \"free exercise of religion will be eviscerated.\"\nAlthough, while in the Senate, Santorum supported the occasional pro-choice Republican, he calls Roe v. Wade a \"monstrosity\" and supports criminalization of abortion, which he says is the reason Social Security is in trouble. He backs right-wing attacks on funding for Planned Parenthood's family planning services, actively taking part in the right-wing propaganda campaign against Planned Parenthood. Santorum has slammed the Griswold decision, in which the Supreme Court recognized a constitutional right to privacy and overturned a state ban on contraception, as a \"constitutional wrecking ball.\"\nSantorum gave Religious Right activists a powerful tool for pushing religion into public school classrooms when he sponsored an amendment to the \"No Child Left Behind\" law that encouraged the teaching of intelligent design in science classes. The amendment, written in part by the creationist Discovery Institute, became a force behind creationists' bogus \"teach the controversy\" strategy. Santorum wrote in 2002 that \"Intelligent Design is a legitimate scientific theory that should be taught in science classes.\" Scientists and courts disagree.\nSantorum has been a severe critic of Islam from his perch at the \"America's Enemies\" program at the right-wing Ethics and Public Policy Center. He says Islam is incompatible with western civilization because Shariah is both a civil code and a religious code. But he also says of Christians that \"it is our obligation\" to make civil law in America \"comport with God's laws.\"\nSantorum has tried to get attention to his desire to be the second Catholic president by slamming the first, saying he was \"appalled\" by John F. Kennedy's \"radical\" support for the separation of church and state - a centerpiece of Kennedy's vision of America. Speaking of the Kennedys, Santorum criticized church officials for praising former senator Ted Kennedy at his funeral, saying there was \"no excuse\" for it and arguing that it was harmful to send the message that it was okay for Catholic politicians to dissent from church teachings.\nAlthough Santorum has been quick to slam progressive Catholics for not hewing closely enough to the doctrine of Church hierarchy, he's shown no compunction in casting aside Church teaching when it conflicts with his extreme ideology, as he did when repeatedly supporting \"enhanced interrogation\" techniques like waterboarding -- which has been clearly labeled \"torture\" and \"an intrinsic evil\" by the Catholic Church.\nSantorum blamed the church's sex abuse scandal on the liberal political culture of Boston:\nPriests, like all of us, are affected by culture. When the culture is sick, every element in it becomes infected. While it is no excuse for this scandal, it is no surprise that Boston, a seat of academic, political and cultural liberalism in America, lies at the center of the storm.\nObama as Enemy\nAt least one columnist has suggested that Santorum is angling for a VP spot, where he would serve as the GOP campaign's attack dog. He has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to savage President Obama in the most extreme terms. Obama he says , does not have \"a love of this country and an understanding of the basic values and wants and desires of its people.\" If Obama is reelected, he says , \"Democracy and freedom will disappear.\" Santorum says Obama's talk about his faith is \"phony\" because the president, like other liberal Christians, has \"abandoned Christendom\" and has no \"right to claim it.\" In fact, he says , Obama and \"the left\" are actively seeking to \"destroy the family and destroy the Church\" because that is the only way they can \"be successful in getting socialism to be accepted in this country and that's what their objective is.\" During the 2008 campaign, Santorum was declared one of Keith Olbermann's \"Worst Persons in the World\" for continuing to spread the right-wing lie that Obama \"won't wear the American flag pin.\"\nWhen President Obama criticized cable news, Santorum ridiculously portrayed it as a prelude to tyrannical censorship: \"This reminds me of what Hugo Chavez is doing down in Venezuela, trying to shut down the voice of opposition in the media.\" He says Obama \"doesn't believe in the foundational principles that made this country great, which is limited government and free people.\" He said his own grandfather came from fascist Italy to a country that would allow him to be free: \"That's the kind of change we need in Washington, DC.\"\nIn an April 28, 2011 foreign policy speech at the National Press Club, Santorum declared that \"unlike President Obama I believe we were a great country even before the Great Society Programs of the 1960s.\" He went on to say, \"Freedom has been our watchword, our anchor and our moral guide for nearly every cause both here and abroad. But today we have lost this mission because our president doesn't believe in it.\" After another (now-GOP-requisite) slam on Obama for not believing in American exceptionalism, Santorum slammed Obama for not doing more to support protesters in Iran: \"We sided with evil because our president believes our enemies are legitimately aggrieved and thus we have no standing to intervene.\" Last year Santorum reportedly told a Pennsylvania crowd \"that Obama seeks to make the United States like Europe, a continent whose citizens have turned their backs on faith and grown selfish, and where governments bestow rights upon the citizenry, rather than a place where all are born with God-given rights.\"\nViolating Reagan's 11th Commandment\nOne reason Santorum might not be very popular in spite of his reliably right-wing record is that he is a habitual violator of Ronald Reagan's 11th Commandment. Santorum seems quite happy to speak ill of his fellow Republicans. He has slammed Romney as \"Obama's running mate\" (a reference to Romney's support for health care reform in Massachusetts) and criticized Newt Gingrich for criticizing Paul Ryan.\nDuring the 2008 campaign, he repeatedly criticized John McCain. After pledging that he would never support McCain, he tepidly endorsed him after Sarah Palin joined the ticket. Santorum even wrote a snide column after McCain's loss predicting (wrongly) that McCain would seek historical redemption by leading the charge in Congress to help Obama move his agenda.\nOne of Santorum's less-successful slams on a fellow Republican came when he criticized Sarah Palin for not attending the Conservative Political Action Conference and suggested that her duties as a mom to five kids may have made her too busy. Palin in turn suggested that Santorum might be a \"knuckle-dragging Neanderthal.\"\nGod's Candidate?\nSantorum sees politics in spiritual terms. He says that government gets bigger and more intrusive without a \"moral consensus\" to guide society. In 2008 he told faculty and students at right-wing Ave Maria University, \"This is not a political war, it is not a cultural war; it's a spiritual war.\" Santorum suggested that his opponents were agents of Satan: \"The Father of Lies has his sights on what you would think the Father of Lies would have his sights on -- a good, decent, powerful, influential country: the United States of America.\" He warned the students that if they signed up for God's army, \"you'll be ridiculed and you'll lose most if not every one of your battles. But you know who's going to win in the end, so you warrior on happily.\"\nThe Campaign Limps Along\nLast spring, Santorum said he saw \"an opening for someone who can unite the various primary factions -- economic libertarians, party establishment types and cultural conservatives,\" according to CBS News' Marc Ambinder. But after more than a year of campaigning, Santorum is polling at just two percent among Republicans.\nSantorum is unfazed, saying that his poor showing in national polls is only because he's focusing on important early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, where he won a GOP straw poll earlier this year. Though to keep that win in perspective, Santorum was the only candidate to show up to the GOP dinner and took 150 votes out of the 408 cast.\nCross posted on The Huffington Post\nIt's hard to predict what could happen in the GOP primary, but at this point, Santorum's barely-limping-along campaign seems in need of divine intervention.\nPFAW\nOversight Committee to Look to Vulnerable Targets for Budget Cuts, Avoid Tough Scrutiny\nWed, 06/01/2011 - 1:25pm \u2014 Justin\nThe House Oversight and Governmental Reform Committee is planning two hearings today, providing an interesting one-two punch against favorite Republican debt scapegoats: public workers and the poor.\nThe first hearing of the day, Official Time: Good Value for the Taxpayer? will likely discuss how we need to shrink the size of the federal workforce. The second, Duplication, Overlap and Inefficiencies in Federal Welfare Programs will likely discuss how our social safety net is somehow unsustainable.\nMy predictions as to the take-away messages of these hearings are based on Chairman Issa\u2019s predictable witness list. As we\u2019ve noted with great frequency, Issa calls industry and think-tank \u201cexperts\u201d to the stand who will tell him what he wants to hear, and today\u2019s lineup is no exception. The Heritage Foundation will be featured prominently this afternoon, as well as the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Interestingly, both of these very conservative think tanks have received large amounts of funding from the Koch brothers \u2013 to the tune of $4,115,571 and $700,499 respectively in 2009. Yes, these are the very same Koch brothers who quietly fund the tea party and a plethora of right wing politicians and organizations. Check out the Center for American Progress\u2019 report and PFAW\u2019s Koch Brothers Fact Sheet for many, many more details.\nJohn Mashburn, executive director of the Carleson Center for Public Policy , will be testifying in the welfare hearing. His organization, which might as well be the Ronald Reagan fan club, wants to reduce federal assistance programs to a series of block grants administered by the states:\nThe first order of business for the CCPP will be to help reverse the damage done to the 1996 welfare reform. Then, it will concentrate on extending the successful design of returning power and responsibility to the states for other welfare programs, specifically Medicaid and Food Stamps.\nAgenda items:\nRestore the integrity of the 1996 welfare reform.\nDevelop a plan to emulate the 1996 model to block grant Medicaid to the states.\nDevelop a plan to block grant the Food Stamp program to the states.\nDevelop a plan to consolidate the 180+ additional categorical federal means-tested programs and replace them with finite block grants to the states.\nAs many Republicans are discovering back home in their districts, applying this goal to Medicare is proving to be rather unpopular. It\u2019s concerning that other important social programs could face the same treatment, especially since the beneficiaries of these programs don\u2019t carry the same political clout as senior citizens.\nPFAW\nHochul Wins Election by Opposing Medicare Cuts\nWed, 05/25/2011 - 5:12pm \u2014 Coral\nLast night was a big win for progress, and a big loss for Paul Ryan\u2019s plan to cut Medicare. Democrat Kathy Hochul won a special election in New York\u2019s traditionally conservative 26th district. The critical issue in this election to replace Republican Rep. Chris Lee focused on the Paul Ryan budget plan\u2019s major cuts to Medicare. Republican Jane Corwin, who ran against Hochul, said she supported the GOP\u2019s plan \u2013 and the senior citizens composing 15-20% of her district didn\u2019t approve.\nRyan\u2019s plan proposes to cut Medicare, replace it with a voucher program and turn Medicaid into a state block grant program \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t do anything to actually control costs. The Ryan Plan lessens healthcare costs to the taxpayers and federal government, pushing them directly onto the patient instead. On top of that, the Congressional Budget Office found that Ryan\u2019s proposal would actually increase the total healthcare spending, quite contrary to the GOP\u2019s pitch for it.\nOh, and did we mention that Ryan wants to lower taxes for the wealthy? His proposed budget includes a tax cut from 35% to 25% for some of the richest people in America. This is nothing new from the Republican Party, cutting services to the middle class while giving breaks to the elite, but it\u2019s certainly disturbing.\nPFAW\nShameful!\nThu, 05/19/2011 - 4:46pm \u2014 Michael Keegan\nImagine senators of one party filibustering a judicial nominee who has been hailed as one of his generation\u2019s great legal minds by legal experts of both parties and across the ideological spectrum on the grounds that he is *too* qualified.\nWell that's exactly what happened today.\nIn what could be the most egregious example of the GOP\u2019s partisan obstruction of judicial nominations to date, Senate Republicans today blocked Goodwin Liu from receiving an up or down vote. Liu, a law professor and dean at U.C. Berkeley who as a nominee has the American Bar Association\u2019s highest rating, was nominated for a seat on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals by President Obama over a year ago, and has since been approved by the Judiciary Committee three times.\nHis credentials and grasp of the law and Constitution are impeccable. Liu\u2019s only mistake: being too qualified.\nAt age 40, his confirmation to the 9th Circuit could put him in position to be the first Asian American Supreme Court nominee. Because of his intellectual heft, his commitment to Americans\u2019 constitutional rights and his commonsense understanding of how the law impacts people\u2019s lives, the prospect of Liu\u2019s future elevation, and even his influence on a Circuit Court of Appeals, terrifies corporate special interests and right-wing ideologues ... the same people calling the shots with Republican senators.\nShame on them. The concocted justifications Republican senators used in their opposition to Liu were based on unbelievable distortions of his record by Radical Right activist groups, as well as Liu\u2019s testimony in opposition to Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s confirmation. They rested their opposition on lies because they know that a Liu filibuster makes a mockery of the supposed agreement between parties to employ a filibuster only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d Everything about Goodwin Liu\u2019s record and the breadth of his support indicates a legal expert squarely in the mainstream -- the only thing \u201cextraordinary\u201d about him is how good he is, and how deserving he was of confirmation.\nEvery GOP senator except Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski participated in the filibuster. If one or both of your U.S. senators are Republicans, CALL them right now and let them hear it. Tell them, \u201cshame on you for filibustering Goodwin Liu,\u201d and let them know that you will be working hard to hold them accountable in their state.\nMake sure you SIGN our \u201cStop the Obstruction\u201d petition to the Senate and let senators of both parties know that the continued obstruction of the president\u2019s nominees is hurting our country and will not be tolerated.\nWe need Republicans to feel the pressure about their judicial obstructions just like they are feeling it about their attacks on Medicare. And Democratic leaders in the Senate need to know that they must be using every tool in their arsenal to combat this obstruction.\nPFAW\nNewt\u2019s Principles\nMon, 05/16/2011 - 12:29pm \u2014 Miranda\nThis weekend, presidential candidate Newt Gingrich raised eyebrows when he became the first prominent Republican to trash talk the House GOP\u2019s wildly unpopular plan to destroy Medicare, calling it \u201cright-wing social engineering.\u201d Gingrich didn\u2019t earn points for consistency, seeing that he had previously expressed support for the plan, and has all along celebrated the plan to decimate Medicaid, a program that also helps millions of seniors pay for health care, but is less beloved of the GOP base. But at least this time he seemed to be taking a somewhat principled stand against his party\u2019s war on the poor and the elderly.\nBut then he changed his mind. Again. The day after the news of Gingrich\u2019s rant against the Paul Ryan budget broke, his spokeswoman started walking back his criticism and blaming the media for misinterpreting his comments. \"There is little daylight between Ryan and Gingrich,\" she said.\nNot that this double flip-flop comes as a surprise.\nRecently, for instance, Gingrich did a similar transparent U-turn on the Libya intervention, and then denied that he had changed his mind. And these are only the latest examples.\nIn the Huffington Post on Friday, People For\u2019s Michael Keegan looked back at Gingrich\u2019s long history of \u201ctoxic McCarthyism, petty and unprincipled partisanship, and preening self-promotion. If Gingrich\u2019s history is any guide, the only principle we can expect him to stick with is political expediency.\nPFAW\nThe GOP\u2019s Not-So-Awesome Spring Break\nTue, 05/03/2011 - 10:55am \u2014 Miranda\nLast month, just before adjourning for spring recess, the House passed Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s 2012 budget proposal. The budget, which was supported by all but four Republican House members, decimates Medicare and Medicaid, makes deep cuts to education programs and preserves every single tax cut and loophole currently enjoyed by corporations and the wealthy.\nIt turns out that a lot of people that voted for these GOP representatives aren\u2019t so happy about having to sacrifice their own retirement security to make sure that the wealthiest Americans can keep on amassing wealth. Think Progress put together this video of GOP congressmen across the country spending their spring breaks trying to defend their votes to peeved constituents at town hall meetings:\nPFAW\nPoll: Keep Important Programs, Tax Fairly\nTue, 04/19/2011 - 1:48pm \u2014 Justin\nAs People For\u2019s Michael Keegan wrote to the New York Times last week, Americans recognize that reducing the deficit requires cutting spending and/or raising taxes. A new McClatchy-Marist poll should be of great assistance to Congress as it determines how to deal with this reality. The poll\u2019s results are straightforward: Don\u2019t ask average Americans to sacrifice what they need so that the wealthiest Americans and corporations can have more of what they want.\nMarching Order #1: Americans want a fair tax system in which people pay what they owe.\n64 percent of voters believe that taxes should be raised on people earning more than $250,000. Overwhelming majorities of Democrats and Independents support this fair tax increase, and even Republicans are not far behind with 43 percent in agreement.\nMarching Order #2: Don\u2019t pay for tax cuts for the wealthy by cutting important programs.\nA huge majority of voters\u201480 percent overall and 73 percent of Republicans\u2014do not want to lose access to important programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Opposition to Medicare/Medicaid cuts among small-government Tea Partiers, where one might expect reduced support for a big entitlement program, does in fact drop\u2014to a robust 70 percent.\nThe bottom line: Americans are tired of hearing that there aren\u2019t enough resources to support the programs that they deserve, yet another round of tax breaks for someone else is somehow a good idea. With two-thirds of Americans believing that the country is on the wrong track, Congress would be wise to take note.\nPFAW\nObama: GOP Budget Changes \u201cthe Basic Social Compact in America\u201d\nWed, 04/13/2011 - 3:13pm \u2014 Miranda\nPresident Obama, in a speech on the budget this afternoon, ripped into the GOP budget plan created by Rep. Paul Ryan, which would decimate Medicare and Medicaid, as well as programs like Pell Grants for higher education, in order to pay for continuing tax cuts for corporation and the wealthy. The GOP\u2019s proposed cuts, Obama said, \u201cpaint a vision of our future that\u2019s deeply pessimistic.\u201d\nWorst of all, this is a vision that says even though America can\u2019t afford to invest in education or clean energy; even though we can\u2019t afford to care for seniors and poor children, we can somehow afford more than $1 trillion in new tax breaks for the wealthy. Think about it. In the last decade, the average income of the bottom 90% of all working Americans actually declined. The top 1% saw their income rise by an average of more than a quarter of a million dollars each. And that\u2019s who needs to pay less taxes? They want to give people like me a two hundred thousand dollar tax cut that\u2019s paid for by asking thirty three seniors to each pay six thousand dollars more in health costs? That\u2019s not right, and it\u2019s not going to happen as long as I\u2019m President.\nThe fact is, their vision is less about reducing the deficit than it is about changing the basic social compact in America. As Ronald Reagan\u2019s own budget director said, there\u2019s nothing \u201cserious\u201d or \u201ccourageous\u201d about this plan. There\u2019s nothing serious about a plan that claims to reduce the deficit by spending a trillion dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. There\u2019s nothing courageous about asking for sacrifice from those who can least afford it and don\u2019t have any clout on Capitol Hill. And this is not a vision of the America I know.\nLast week, People For\u2019s Michael Keegan wrote about the GOP budget\u2019s call for \u201cshared sacrifice without the sharing\u201d:\nThe new Republican majority was swept into power with promises of \"fiscal responsibility\"... but backed by the bank accounts of corporate America. As a result, the \"fiscal responsibility\" they're proposing requires great sacrifices from ordinary Americans while letting large corporations and the wealthiest continue to benefit from the status quo. When these pro-corporate politicians talk about the need for \"shared sacrifice,\" they're talking about individual Americans giving up education, clean drinking water, and cops on the streets. When they say they'll never raise taxes, they don't mean protecting middle class Americans from tax hikes --nobody's proposing to raise taxes on working families -- they're talking about letting multinational corporations keep their tax loopholes and letting the wealthiest sliver of Americans keep their massive, supposedly temporary, tax breaks.\nPFAW\nKarl Rove\u2019s Crossroads GPS Blasts Unions in Misleading Ad\nWed, 03/09/2011 - 1:41pm \u2014 Brian\nA shadowy political organization founded by Karl Rove is spending $750,000 to run a nationwide ad blasting workers and their collective bargaining rights. Crossroads GPS is a pro-corporate group with a history of using misleading if not outright false claims to attack Democrats and progressive causes. The organization does not disclose its donors but NBC News found that \u201ca substantial portion of Crossroads GPS\u2019 money came from a small circle of extremely wealthy Wall Street hedge fund and private equity moguls.\u201d\nNow, the group is out with an ad trashing organized labor on cable news in light of attempts to cut the collective bargaining rights of public employees in Wisconsin , Ohio , and Idaho . Crossroads GPS asserts that public employees are overpaid, however, a study from the Economic Policy Institute shows that public workers in Wisconsin and Ohio actually \u201cearn lower wages than comparable private sector employees.\u201d\nCrossroads GPS isn\u2019t the only shadowy pro-corporate group to support the GOP\u2019s war on organized labor.\nAmericans for Prosperity , an organization closely tied to the Koch Brothers, is vigorously supporting Republican union-busting and unfairly blames public workers for the country\u2019s budget problems. Like Crossroads GPS, Americans for Prosperity doesn\u2019t disclose its donors and advocates for the agenda of corporate special interests.\nAs People For president Michael Keegan writes , the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United has empowered groups like Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity to secretly use corporate money to fund pro-corporate causes:\nWhat is perhaps most troubling about the post- Citizens United flood of corporate money in politics is the free rein it has given for corporations to hide behind front groups to run misleading ads without ever being held accountable for their content. Americans for Prosperity is now employing the same tactics it used to smear health care reform in key House districts in its ad campaign against Wisconsin unions. Like in its ads falsely claiming that health care reform hurt Medicare recipients, the group's ads in Wisconsin pretend to champion populist values while pushing a decidedly anti-populist agenda. The ads seek not only to misinform voters, but to blame ordinary Americans for problems they did not cause.\nPFAW\nWisconsin YEO Chris Larson Stands Up To GOP Power Play\nThu, 03/03/2011 - 10:24am \u2014 Brian\nRepublicans in the Wisconsin State Senate announced that they will penalize the fourteen boycotting Senators by imposing a $100-a-day fine and taking away their parking spaces, but the chamber\u2019s Democrats are determined to block the GOP\u2019s radical anti-labor legislation . In an interview with Talking Points Memo , Democratic State Sen. Chris Larson described the group\u2019s resolve not to budge in the face of Republican threats. Sen. Larson is a member of PFAW Foundation\u2019s Young Elected Officials Network , and is working closely with PFAW to build momentum to stop Governor Scott Walker\u2019s plan to quash workers\u2019 rights. He makes clear that the public is increasingly turning against Walker\u2019s plans , and that the Republicans\u2019 latest move only shows their desperation to quickly pass their extreme legislation :\n\"They've become increasingly desperate with these petty things that they're throwing out there,\" Larson said. \"The next thing they're gonna throw out is we're gonna have to say 'Mother, may I' before anybody can talk.\"\nTPM asked Larson, who said he was at a rest stop in Illinois, whether he was prepared to pay the fines. \"You know, it's not about us, it's not about the finances,\" said Larson. \"It's about the cuts that they're doing to workers rights, it's about the cuts that they're doing to educators, and throwing out Medicare, Medicaid and Seniorcare, and trying to change these provisions.\"\nLarson also was not entirely sure whether the fines were legally permissible. \"First of all, it's in the Constitution that you cannot diminish a person's wages,\" said Larson. \"But it's beside the point. The fact that they're trying to hold our paychecks and have these fines, it's petty and it's not impacting anybody. We had a meeting and nobody flinched at it. It was just like, wow, he's [Fitzgerald] looking really desperate.\"\nLater in the interview, TPM noted to Larson that the fines appeared to be based on a provision in the state Constitution that the legislature \"may compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each house may provide.\"\n\"Well, we'll have to see when we go back,\" said Larson. \"We'll go over it with some lawyers. The fact is, it's giving - it's not making us think about it twice. We're focused on preserving workers' rights, preserving the way of life in Wisconsin without these huge cuts to rights. That's what we're focused on.\n\"If they want to throw out fines, if they want to call us names and if they want to take over our staff, they're doing everything they can to ignore what the real issue is, and that's that they're going too far with their power grab. The public is crying foul and calling them out on their power grab, and they're just ignoring it.\"\nHe also added: \"What they do to us is of little consequence, compared to what they're doing to themselves right now.\"\nPFAW\nAnother Step Forward for LGBT Equality\nWed, 01/19/2011 - 1:26pm \u2014 Paul\nIn a step forward for LGBT equality, the Obama Administration's new hospital visitation regulations go into effect today. Under the rules, hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid can no longer deny visitation privileges based on factors including sexual orientation or gender identity. To forcibly separate loving couples when one of them is sick or even dying is cruel and wrong.\nThe Deputy Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement writes :\nThis significant policy change is due in no small part to the journeys of two incredibly courageous and passionate women, Janice Langbehn and Charlene Strong. Both lived through unimaginable experiences with the loss of their wives and life partners. While I never had the opportunity to meet Janice's wife Lisa Pond, or Charlene's wife Kate Fleming, I have had the honor to meet and work with Janice and Charlene. I want to thank them for bringing us all into their lives and for sharing themselves and their families with us, and for using their voices to make lives better for LGBT families.\nTo have a White House publication referring to \"Janice's wife Lisa\" or \"Charlene's wife Kate\" is no small indication of societal change. Words have power, and the more people get used to hearing juxtapositions like these, the less alien the idea becomes.\nPFAW\nDemocrats Eschew Republican Example and Follow the Constitution\nThu, 12/02/2010 - 6:11pm \u2014 Paul\nThis week, Americans get to see the difference between a party that respects the rule of law and one that holds it in contempt.\nEarlier this week, Senate Democrats got a food safety bill passed - then discovered a procedural problem with constitutional implications: One section of the Senate bill would raise revenue, but the Constitution requires revenue bills to originate in the House. Now, in the face of Republican obstruction, Democratic leaders are working to figure out how to get the bill passed correctly before time runs out.\nWhile the headlines are on the mistake, the main focus really should be on how Democratic leaders are responding appropriately to it - in stark contrast to how Republican leaders dealt with a similar foul-up in February 2006, when they controlled Congress. GOP leaders sent a bill for the president's signature that they knew had not passed the House.\nThe Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005 squeaked through the Senate after Vice President Cheney cast the tie-breaking vote. But when the bill was transmitted to the House, in a mistake that no one noticed at the time, one of the numbers in the bill text was changed, changing the rights of Medicare recipients and creating a $2 billion difference between the two bills. The House passed its version with a bare two-vote margin. Then Republican leaders discovered that the two chambers had voted on different bills, meaning that a basic constitutional requirement had not been met.\nHaving a revote would have been politically difficult. So, faced with a choice between their partisan political agenda and the United States Constitution, GOP leaders chose ... politics. They sent the Senate version to the White House for President Bush's signature, with the Republican Speaker's false certification that it had passed both chambers.\nAs the Washington Post reported at the time:\nOnce the mistake was revealed, Republican leaders were loath to fight the battle again by having another vote, so White House officials simply deemed the Senate version to be the law. ...\nThe issue would be solved if the House voted again, this time on the version that passed the Senate. But that would mark the third time House members would have to cast their votes on a politically difficult bill, containing cuts in many popular programs, and it would be that much closer to the November election.\nThe way the two parties handled similar situations speaks volumes about their commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law.\nPFAW\nThe Most Outrageous Ads of the Election\nMon, 11/01/2010 - 1:00pm \u2014 Brian\nThis election cycle has experienced a massive flood of political spending following the dramatic weakening of campaign finance laws in cases such as Citizens United and SpeechNow. According to Political Correction , between August 1st and October 29th, the ten biggest right-wing groups, many of which are backed by contributions by corporations and don\u2019t publicly disclose their donors, have spent about $100 million to air 109,826 ads. Many of the conservative candidates and organizations have been employing false claims and polarizing smears in their ads meant to foment cultural divisions and discredit progressive legislation. Here are just a handful of the most outrageous and irresponsible ads used this election year:\nAnti-Muslim Rhetoric\nThe Right Wing has used the Park51 Community Center as a way to provoke fear, stoke divisions, and promote intolerance. The debate surrounding the community center has been riddled with attacks on religious freedom and baseless claims that the project\u2019s organizers have ties to extremist groups, and the right has attempted to make the community center in Lower Manhattan an election issue in places like Iowa and North Carolina.\n"}, {"score": 963.2254, "uuid": "d96ab4f1-f8fd-5cf8-8255-918184c54e0a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-04-09886", "target_hostname": "www.philly.com", "target_uri": "http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20120401_Consumer_12_0___In_defense_of_Obamacare.html?cmpid=138890509", "page_rank": 1.2066079e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "Consumer 12.0: In defense of <em>Obamacare</em>", "snippet": "Regulating commerce &quot;among the several States&quot; <em>is</em> among the &quot;enumerated powers&quot; that the Constitution gives Congress. I can&#x27;t say it <em>better</em> <em>than</em> legal scholar Charles Fried, solicitor general under President Ronald Reagan, did last week: &quot;Health care <em>is</em> interstate commerce.", "explanation": null, "document": "A $1M gift will keep the music going\nI've never had much worry about access to affordable health care, thanks to steady work, good luck on the chronic-disease front, and my sterling ability to dodge dangerous drivers on the Schuylkill Expressway.\nBut I've watched others suffer for a lack of it, and I worry about my daughters having to navigate an increasingly tough health-care market. So I was struck last week at the breathtaking lack of common sense among some of our nation's smartest people.\nYes, I'm talking about the U.S. Supreme Court, though I mean no disrespect. People like Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Samuel Alito are razor-sharp, quick on their feet, and often witty. But then they do things like comparing health insurance to broccoli or emergency roadside assistance, or joke that actually having to review details of a 2,700-page law rather than just tossing it out would violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Really?\nSince the justices have undoubtedly had Grade A health insurance throughout their high-powered careers, maybe they're just too distant from the real world to understand what's at stake for more than 40 million Americans who lack insurance, or for everybody else who's just one layoff and a bad medical break away from having to forgo crucial care or face a medical bankruptcy. So here are five things I hope the justices keep in mind as they weigh the fate of Obamacare:\nThe health-care market is a genuine mess. If that's not obvious, it should be. Tens of millions of people - as many as one of every four people in Texas, leader of the pack - lack coverage. For all but the wealthiest, facing a serious injury or illness without insurance means also facing financial catastrophe. For the unluckiest among us, care can cost millions of dollars - that's why it's a big deal that Obamacare will finally bar most annual and lifetime limits.\nIf the uninsured can't pay, the rest of us pick up the tab. According to Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., Congress found that about $43 billion a year of that burden is redistributed through \"an unfair patchwork of hidden cost-shifting\" that adds about $1,000 a year to every insured family's premium.\nThe libertarian position is fantasy. You know the everybody-just-take-personal-responsibility argument - the one ventured by U.S. Rep. Ron Paul to a cheering debate crowd when asked what should happen if a young man arrives, uninsured, at a hospital in urgent need of care. \"That's what freedom is all about, taking your own risks,\" he said.\nUnlike some libertarians, Paul didn't suggest just turning the man away - as a doctor, he knows that's been against federal law since the 1980s, and wouldn't play well beyond his fans. But here's the bottom line: Unless we want to roll back the clock to a world where patients die outside hospital doors, the only question is who pays.\nPaul's stance was echoed last week by Mitt Romney, who responded to a similar question from Jay Leno: \"If they're 45 years old and they show up and they say, 'I want insurance because I've got heart disease,' it's like, 'Hey, guys, we can't play the game like that.' You've got to get insurance while you're well, and then if you get ill you're going to be covered.\"\nAnd if you're not? We're back to the who-pays question. That's why we're discussing the individual mandate, a market-based alternative that both sides of the political spectrum considered an imperfect compromise - that is, before conservatives started disavowing it as an affront to liberty. Personally, I'd prefer Medicare-for-all.\nThe opponents' Commerce Clause argument doesn't pass the smell test. Health-care accounts for about 17 percent of the national economy, and virtually everyone needs it at some point. Regulating commerce \"among the several States\" is among the \"enumerated powers\" that the Constitution gives Congress. I can't say it better than legal scholar Charles Fried, solicitor general under President Ronald Reagan, did last week: \"Health care is interstate commerce. Is this a regulation of it? Yes. End of story.\"\n\"Congress isn't forcing people into that market to regulate them,\" Fried told the Washington Post, rejecting as \"a canard\" that key framing by Obamacare opponents. \"I was astonished to hear it coming out of the mouths of the people on that bench.\"\nWhen he took over the case for Obamacare's opponents, Paul D. Clement, another former solicitor general, wisely ditched the hair-splitting distinction the law's foes first tried to make between regulating activity and inactivity. But the new framing - that Congress is wrongly using the individual mandate \"to create commerce\" - is only slightly less artificial.\nThe truth is, we're all \"in the health care market,\" simply because life is fragile and unpredictable. Young and healthy as you are, you can arrive at a hospital unconscious after getting hit by a bus. Which brings us to ...\nNo, it's not like broccoli, or cellphones, or burial insurance. My not buying a cellphone generally doesn't raise the cost for everybody else. Burials can be pricey, but keeping people alive is what can cost millions.

Obamacare Suffers another Blow\nPosted by James Wilson\nThe 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Friday the 12th that Obamacare's \"individual mandate\" violates the Constitution. This mandate, which is the foundation of Obamacare, requires individuals to purchase health insurance.\nThe Supreme Court must now rule on this question, but we shouldn't have to wait for that. I sent a letter to Congress telling them to repeal Obamacare now.\nThe hard-wired message says simply, \"Please repeal Obamacare.\"\nI added these comments...\nUncertainty over what Obamacare will really cost companies is probably the major reason they're reluctant to hire new people. Repeal Obamacare quickly, and this uncertainty will disappear. Unemployment would probably fall instantly, and dramatically.\nRepealing Obamacare is probably the best thing you could do to create jobs.\nBut that's not the only reason to repeal it.\nObamacare never had public support. It still doesn't. The American people hate it. Plus...\nThe \"individual mandate\" is an affront to a free society. It violates the Constitution. The 11th Circuit agrees, and the Supreme Court will probably agree too.\nAnd if the individual mandate goes, so must the rest of Obamacare. The individual mandate was essential to the scheme, because Obamacare also requires insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The only way companies could afford that is through the requirement that everyone has to buy their product. But that won't work if the court rejects the individual mandate.\nThis is a dangerous situation. If the Supreme Court kills the individual mandate, but not the whole of Obamacare, then the uncertainty companies face will grow. Job creation will remain stagnant.\nAmerica can't afford to wait for a Supreme Court ruling, and then for further Congressional action to clarify things after the ruling. Instead, Congress should \"fix\" the problems of Obamacare by repealing ALL of it now.\nYou should also take IMMEDIATE steps to make health care more affordable, which is the key to expanding access. You can do this by allowing INDIVIDUALS to choose for themselves, with their own money. Here are some ideas...\n* Introduce legislation allowing Americans to buy health insurance from any provider in the country, not just those licensed in their own state. This will reduce premiums for nearly every American.\n* Remove all tax and regulatory incentives that tie health insurance to employment. This will give individuals full ownership over their own health insurance policies. This would also reduce the risk that people will end up uninsured because they change jobs, which is especially important to those Americans who have a family member with a pre-existing condition.\n* Transition Medicare to a true voucher program with Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). People are always more prudent with their own money than they are when spending other people's money. Therefore, HSA's would reduce healthcare prices across the board.\nRepealing Obamacare care now will help the economy immediately. It could also pave the way for more individual choice in healthcare. Choice would bring lowered costs, improved quality, and expanded access.\nYou can do better than Obamacare. Repeal it now. Then start over, using better ideas.\nEND LETTER\nI urge you to send your own letter, or borrow from or copy the above.

In two recent papers, Stuart Butler, Ph.D., and Robert Moffit, Ph.D. of the new Heritage Center for Policy Innovation analyze the problem and offer detailed solutions on how to reverse course.\nButler explains that many objections to Medicare reform are fueled by myths. For instance, many Americans believe that seniors have paid for their own Medicare through payroll taxes. But in reality, only Medicare Part A is financed through payroll taxes. Parts B and D are voluntary and financed through a combination of beneficiary premiums (covering just 25 percent of costs) and subsidies from taxpayers.\nNext, Butler points out , there is no true Medicare trust fund. The program operates as a pay-as-you-go system, meaning revenue immediately goes out the door to pay for current benefits. Another myth is that the payroll tax is a premium and quite different from the income tax. Butler explains, \u201cSince the Medicare payroll tax, unlike the Social Security tax, does not have an income cap, it is actually indistinguishable from a regular income tax bracket.\u201d\nAnother big misconception is the notion that adjusting Medicare benefits based on retirement income would be a radical change. This is false; wealthier seniors already pay higher, income-related premiums in both Part B and Part D.\nRecognition of the Medicare reality is essential for reform. From there, the first step is to put the program on a budget. Medicare is currently categorized as \u201cmandatory\u201d spending, which allows the program\u2019s cost to grow on autopilot. Its budget is open-ended, and spending is determined by whatever the hospital, drug, and physician bills add up to. Instead, Medicare should operate under a real long-term budget, similar to other federal programs like defense.\nThere is bipartisan consensus that Medicare spending should be capped; in fact, Obamacare has already introduced a top-down spending cap on the program. But without the right fundamental changes, this alone is insufficient to control costs. The next, big step is to transform the program into a premium-support system, a defined-contribution system of financing.\nMoffit\u2019s in-depth analysis explains exactly how to move Medicare to this type of consumer-driven system. It would allow seniors to choose their own health plan and receive a defined contribution from the government to offset its cost. Seniors would have access to affordable, adequate benefits, regardless of age or health condition. As Moffit points out , one model of premium support, \u201cthe Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), serving federal workers and retirees, has been a popular and successful premium-support program.\u201d\nAs Senators Richard Burr (R\u2013NC) and Tom Coburn (R\u2013OK) wrote in a recent Politico editorial , \u201cThe way to save Medicare is to build on what is working.\u201d Moffit shows in his research that the FEHBP has outperformed Medicare in every dimension of performance: \u201cIt has better benefits, better service, catastrophic limits on what enrollees must pay, and far better premium cost control.\u201d\nA consumer-driven, market-based Medicare program can foster competition and control costs without sacrificing quality of care. Patients would be able to seek out and receive better value for dollars spent, impacting the entire health care system. And Moffit\u2019s research shows the benefit for the federal budget: \u201cBased on the estimates of the Heritage Center for Data Analysis (CDA), a Medicare premium-support program would yield $702 billion in savings over 10 years beginning in 2016.\u201d\nButler states , \u201cPatching the framework, or tweaking it at the edges, is not going to address the long-term weaknesses of the program or the enormous financial load it adds to the country\u2019s structural financial problems.\u201d Instead, Medicare needs structural reform that works.

From a high-level procedural posture standpoint, many lower courts have heard cases involving PPACA.\nU.S. District Judge Roger Vinson ruled that the individual health insurance mandate falls outside the federal authority in the Constitution, and that the provision could not be disconnected from PPACA; therefore concluding the entire Act must be struck down. In the converse, members of a three-judge panel at the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the individual health coverage mandate is constitutional. The dissenting judge on the panel argued that the federal Anti-Injunction Act prohibits the federal courts from considering suits seeking to block implementation of new federal taxes, at least until they incur some sort of penalty. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with that judge, dismissing two PPACA cases concerning the individual mandate, finding that the suits were barred under the Anti-Injunction Act.\nThe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals dividedly affirmed Judge Vinson\u2019s decision in part; the panel agreed that the mandate was unconstitutional, but held that it actually could be severed from the rest of the Act, allowing the rest of PPACA to remain. The federal government declined to seek review by the Eleventh Circuit and instead petitioned for the U.S. Supreme Court to review the panel\u2019s ruling. On November 14, 2011, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, and here we are today; the commencement of that hearing.\nDoes the problem child have a future?\nEvery child has a future. In this case, even if PPACA is struck down, all parties seem to agree that future healthcare reform will draw at least in part on Obamacare. However, in this case, of the four issues the Supreme Court has agreed to hear, the key issue is the constitutionality of the individual mandate.\nAccording to a CMIO post , if the Court upholds the individual mandate it will go into effect in 2014. If they strike it down, the Court will then consider whether the mandate is severable from the remainder of the law, which will determine whether PPACA\u2019s other provisions survive. If the Court decides that the individual mandate is \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to PPACA as a whole, they will likely strike down the entire Act.\nOne of the most frequently asked questions in regard to the individual mandate is, \u201cWhat does the provision mean for those who don\u2019t purchase healthcare?\u201d Individuals who can but choose not to obtain qualifying health care coverage under this law will be required to pay a penalty as part of their income tax returns. In 2014, the penalty is $95 or 1% of the individual\u2019s income, whichever is greater.\nHowever, according to NPR , PPACA provides a vast system of subsidies to help people afford health insurance. Subsidies are available to people on a sliding scale, up to 400% of the poverty level. This year that would be a family of three with an income up to $76,360 and a family of four up to $92,050. Even then, if there\u2019s no affordable policy available, people can be declared exempt. And most of those with insurance provided by their employer will meet the requirement automatically, so they won\u2019t have to do anything.\nThe two year check up.\nThe PPACA is alive and kicking with a seemingly healthy heartbeat. I say healthy because of my prediction on how open-and-shut this case is in light of other recent cases on which this Court has ruled, in addition to the myriad tools they have at their disposal. As a matter of fact, given the language of the Commerce Clause, the Court\u2019s clear disdain for how politically-charged this argument has become, and its rulings in Gonzales v. Raich and the cases cited within that case, I truly cannot see how this Court could possibly strike PPACA down, without doing so in the face of all the aforementioned.\nIn an attempt to avoid any more personal opinions, I\u2019ll just give you a few facts as outlined by Bloomberg . Thanks to PPACA, as of today:\nMore than one of every four Americans last year received a free mammogram, colonoscopy or flu shot.\nRoughly 3.6 million Medicare recipients saved an average of $604 as the law began closing a gap in their prescription- drug coverage.\n2.5 million young adults were allowed to remain on their parents\u2019 health-insurance plans until their 26th birthday.\nInsurers, hospitals and doctors are forming alliances and adopting new procedures, preparing for a redesigned market that will debut if and when the law is fully rolled out.\nAs the Supreme Court considers the constitutionality of PPACA, these changes highlight an unappreciated reality: there may be no going back to the world before March 23, 2010, when President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act before a cheering crowd in the East Room of the White House.\nDrew Altman, chief executive officer of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said it better than I\u2019ve seen or heard anyone else put it: \u201cThere\u2019s an old adage in politics: benefits once conferred are almost impossible to take away.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s decision is expected before July of this year.\nFor more about Obamacare and its origins check out my earlier post, Happy 2nd Birthday, Baby Obamacare!\n"}, {"score": 954.83795, "uuid": "3c9d72c2-7cdc-5629-ab3c-1131c0d5249a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100tw-11-12238", "target_hostname": "www.ncgunowners.com", "target_uri": "http://www.ncgunowners.com/forum/Thread-Trump-on-Obamacare", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Trump on <em>Obamacare</em>", "snippet": "GOOD during the healthcare debacle b&#x2F;c the mandate <em>is</em> the primary reason it&#x27;s unconstitutional Well, it was <em>really</em> a necessity, however you spin it, even if it also made it unpopular.", "explanation": null, "document": "Received 301 thanks in 352 posts\nTrump on Obamacare\nNo one can sum it up better than this guy.\nQuote:\nLet me get this straight . . .\nWe're going to be \"gifted\" with a health care\nplan we are forced to purchase and\nfined if we don't,\nWhich purportedly covers at least\nten million more people,\nwithout adding a single new doctor,\nbut provides for 16,000 new IRS agents,\nwritten by a committee whose chairman\nsays he doesn't understand it,\npassed by a Congress that didn't read it but\nexempted themselves from it,\nand signed by a Dumbo President who smokes,\nwith funding administered by a treasury chief who\ndidn't pay his taxes,\nfor which we'll be taxed for four years before any\nbenefits take effect,\nby a government which has\nalready bankrupted Social Security and Medicare,\nall to be overseen by a surgeon general\nwho is obese,\nand financed by a country that's broke!!!!!\n'What the hell could possibly go wrong?'\n\"Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.\"\nDr. Seuss\nVotes: Windage-n-Elevation (+2), Duncan (+2)\nThanks given by:\n"}, {"score": 953.4453, "uuid": "f2918a4e-cf5b-5084-ad1c-74fc090a5c16", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0407wb-22-23629", "target_hostname": "voices.washingtonpost.com", "target_uri": "http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-turn/2011/01/left_unreasoned_and_unprepared.html", "page_rank": 1.1930885e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Right Turn - Left unprepared for <em>ObamaCare</em> ruling", "snippet": "At 5:36 into this video Richard Epstein (UChicagoLaw colleague of Obama) calls the legal challenge to <em>ObamaCare</em> <em>better</em> <em>than</em> what had been thought.

The ruling is. . . um. . . thinking of a case liberals hate. . . um. . . just like Bush v. Gore ! (Except it has nothing to do with the Equal Protection Clause or any other aspect of that case.) It is, we are told, \"curious,\" \"odd,\" or \"unconventional.\"\nThese are complaints, not legal arguments. And they suggest that the left was totally unprepared for the constitutional attack on their beloved handiwork. After all, the recent mocking by the left of conservatives' reverence for the Constitution suggests they are mystified that a 200-year old document could get in the way of their historic achievement. They are truly nonplussed, and so they vamp, not with reasoned analysis but with an outpouring of adjectives.\nLiberals are particularly perturbed by Judge Vinson's ruling on severability, the determination as to whether the individual mandate is so central to the law as to make the law unrecognizable and unenforceable without it. But here, the left has only the administration and the Democratic Congress to blame. From the opinion (the defendants are the Obama officials):\nHaving determined that the individual mandate exceeds Congress' power under the Commerce Clause, and cannot be saved by application of the Necessary and Proper Clause, the next question is whether it is severable from the remainder of the Act. In considering this issue, I note that the defendants have acknowledged that the individual mandate and the Act's health insurance reforms, including the guaranteed issue and community rating, will rise or fall together as these reforms \"cannot be severed from the [individual mandate].\"\nOops. Not some crazy judge, but the administration was the source of the notion that the individual mandate can't be severed from the rest of the law.\nBut it's not just the administration; it seems Congress did its part to contribute to the invalidation of the whole statute. Judge Vinson observes that \"the Act does not contain a 'severability clause,' which is commonly included in legislation to provide that if any part or provision is held invalid, then the rest of the statute will not be affected.\" He observes that this defect is not necessarily determinative. However, \"The lack of a severability clause in this case is significant because one had been included in an earlier version of the Act, but it was removed in the bill that subsequently became law.\" Oh, now, there's a problem.\nThat is no small matter, the judge explains:\nThe absence of a severability clause is further significant because the individual mandate was controversial all during the progress of the legislation and Congress was undoubtedly well aware that legal challenges were coming. Indeed, as noted earlier, even before the Act became law, several states had passed statutes declaring the individual mandate unconstitutional and purporting to exempt their residents from it; and Congress' own attorneys in the [Congressional Research Service] had basically advised that the challenges might well have legal merit as it was 'unclear' if the individual mandate had 'solid constitutional foundation.'\"\nAs the opinion goes on, the judge makes clear that the Obama team dug its own grave on the severability point:\nTo be sure, the words \"protection\" and \"affordable\" in the title of the Act itself are inextricably tied to the health insurance reform provisions (and the individual mandate in particular), as the defendants have emphasized throughout the course of this litigation\nEzra Klein cherry picks one line from the case (\"This is not a situation that is likely to be repeated\") as evidence the court is doing something untoward. But a cursory reading of the the preceding pages explains why this outcome is not likely to be repeated. Congress in removing the severability clause, the Obama lawyers in repeatedly arguing the individual mandate was essential to the statute and, finally, the interlocking pieces of the statute itself are such that it's hard to imagine a similar case arising.\nThe only thing \"odd\" about the ruling is the left's response. The cheerleaders for ObamaCare better hope the Obama legal team has some better arguments in the upcoming rounds of litigation.\n2011\n"}], [{"score": 951.7111, "uuid": "01e058c3-63d7-53c8-a6cf-fda0692a3ccc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1200tw-61-07993", "target_hostname": "www.salon.com", "target_uri": "http://www.salon.com/2012/03/28/your_obamacare_stories/", "page_rank": 1.1951785e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Your <em>Obamacare</em> stories - Healthcare Reform - Salon.com", "snippet": "The kind interpretation <em>is</em> that the justices don\u2019t know how the health care market works <em>any</em> <em>better</em> <em>than</em> most reporters do, so they\u2019re grasping for ways to understand it.", "explanation": null, "document": "Wednesday, Mar 28, 2012 7:30 PM UTC2012-03-28T19:30:00Zl, M j, Y g:i A T\nYour Obamacare stories\nAs the Supreme Court debate rages on, we want to feature stories about how the law has affected you\nTopics: Healthcare Reform , Supreme Court\nTwo years after the president signed it into law, Obamacare is beginning to have a big impact: Millions more young adults are insured; prescription costs for the elderly are on the decline; and children with preexisting conditions can no longer be denied coverage.

Once-ludicrous opinions might carry the day\nTopics: Supreme Court , Healthcare Reform\nWednesday\u2019s Supreme Court arguments on the Affordable Care Act involved complex technical issues of \u201cseverability\u201d and \u201cconditional federal spending,\u201d so let\u2019s get right to the core issue. The judges are being asked to take away health insurance from millions of people. And judging from what they said, they just might do it. Constitutional arguments that were clear howlers a few days ago now have a chance at becoming the law of the land.\nThe severability issue presupposes that the Court is going to accept the stupid arguments against the mandate. If it does, the Court must decide how much of the rest of the statute has to be struck down as well? The answer depends on how much of it Congress would have passed had it known it could not enact the mandate. The Obama administration claims that if the Court strikes down the mandate that individuals purchase insurance, it must also invalidate the prohibition against insurers discriminating against people with preexisting conditions, and the law\u2019s limitations on how insurers can set rates. Its opponents want to throw out the whole thing. The Court had to appoint a lawyer itself in order to hear arguments that the rest of the law could work without the mandate, because there are other mechanisms, such as subsidies, to encourage young, healthy people to buy insurance.\nThe most extreme view was that of Justice Antonin Scalia: \u201cMy approach would be to say that if you take the heart out of this statute, the statute\u2019s gone.\u201d But that approach runs into the obvious difficulty that this huge bill contains provisions that have nothing to do with the mandate, such as improvements in Native American healthcare and the extension of benefits for black-lung victims. Pulling apart the obviously irrelevant bits is a huge task. Justice Stephen Breyer asked, \u201cWhat do you propose that we do other than spend a year reading all this?\u201d Even Scalia got a laugh when he asked, \u201cYou really want us to go through these 2,700 pages?\u201d\nEdwin Kneedler, arguing for the United States, pointed out that some provisions are already in effect without the mandate: 2.5 million people under 26 have gotten new coverage, for \u00a0example. Scalia speculated that this was in anticipation of the mandate, and would otherwise bankrupt the insurers, but Kneedler and Justice Sotomayor both pointed out that this is lousy economics: Those healthy people are a net benefit for insurance companies.\nThe complexities of severability may actually strengthen the case for the mandate, as Lyle Denniston pointed out , because they show what a huge task the Court would be taking on if it struck down the mandate. Scalia\u2019s extreme position, if he sticks to it, may also help the mandate in another way, by convincing the other justices that he\u2019s nuts and will say anything to strike down the ACA.\nThe federal spending issue turns on the expansion of Medicaid. Under the ACA, millions of the working poor \u2013 people with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level \u2013 are eligible for Medicaid. From 2014 to 2016, the federal government will pay 100 percent of the costs. Then its share decreases, to 90 percent after 2020. Because the ACA also gives states assistance with their new administrative costs, overall state spending will actually be lowered.\nTwenty-six states are claiming that this conditional spending unconstitutionally coerces them, because they cannot realistically forgo the money, and because if they refuse to expand their rolls, they might lose every cent of Medicaid money. But let\u2019s be clear: This is not about the states wanting to conserve their own money. It is about the states refusing to spend federal money, to help people that they do not want to help. (Paul Clement, the attorney for the challenging states, declared that his argument would not change if the federal government permanently paid 100 percent of the costs.)\nAs a legal matter, this is the craziest argument yet, which is why it was rejected by every lower court that heard it. It implies that, when states get federal money, they have a right to spend it any way they want, with no federal conditions. \u00a0It means that Medicaid itself has always been unconstitutional, along with federal unemployment benefits, highway funds, education funds and many other programs. Justice Breyer repeatedly pointed out that the provision in the Medicaid statute that is being challenged has been there since 1965.\nYet the conservative justices took it remarkably seriously. Because the federal government \u201chas the authority under this provision to say you lose everything,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts declared, \u201cit seems to be a significant intrusion on the sovereign interests of the state.\u201d Justice Anthony Kennedy said, \u201cThere\u2019s no realistic choice.\u201d Justice Scalia offered the astounding claim that \u201cif you predict \u2026 that 100 percent of the States will accept it, that sounds like coercion.\u201d If this is right, then if I offer 10 people triple their salaries to come work for me, and I can confidently predict that they will all accept, I am coercing them. \u00a0Alito endorsed the same idea, and also thought it relevant that the money \u201cis going to have to come out of the same taxpayers that the States have to tax to get their money.\u201d \u00a0That would mean that the federal tax code is itself an invasion of states\u2019 rights. How long must we keep a straight face when presented with this stuff?\nThere was a legitimate basis for the Court to consider many of the issues raised by the healthcare law, since they had divided the lower federal courts and the law needed clarification. But the Medicaid claim created no division: Every lower court agreed that it was without merit. (Just how meritless is explained at length in a characteristically lucid piece by Marty Lederman.)

But as conservative justices echo Michele Bachmann, Democrats' long-term plan should be Medicare for all\nVIDEO\nTopics: Healthcare Reform\nNobody knows what the Supreme Court is going to decide about the Affordable Care Act. Reporters on the left and right have analyzed every justice\u2019s every word and every sigh. Some ACA partisans are panicking; some aren\u2019t. We\u2019ll know what they decide when they announce it, and not a moment earlier.\nIs there anything to say before that? I was going to hold my tongue, until I heard Michele Bachmann compare the individual mandate to the government requiring you to buy broccoli or join a gym \u2013 and then heard some of the conservative justices echo the same lame talking points. The kind interpretation is that the justices don\u2019t know how the health care market works any better than most reporters do, so they\u2019re grasping for ways to understand it. The unkind interpretation is that the conservative intellectual machine that helped produce Antonin Scalia (a Federalist Society alum) churns out talking points that are now parroted not just by unblinking zealots like Bachmann, but at the highest level of government.\nThe other point the questioning made clear is that ironically, Democrats borrowed the most constitutionally questionable aspect of the ACA from Republicans. It\u2019s rich to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys object to throwing Americans into the rapacious insurance-industry maw. Folks on the left had the same objection when the law was being debated.\nNow, the only thing more futile than predicting SCOTUS decisions is second-guessing political decisions that are behind us. The battles within the Democratic Party over ACA, particularly whether it should include a so-called \u201cpublic option,\u201d were bitter and fairly futile. I was on the side of the public option \u2013 which I thought should have been called Medicare for All. But not one of us, on that side, ever convincingly sketched a route to the number of votes needed to make it law. There were a few etch-a-sketch routes, but no one ever showed conclusively, or even terribly persuasively, that anything more progressive than the existing bill could get through Congress.\nThat said, as the justices and others question the individual mandate, it\u2019s hard not to look back at how the ACA compromise came about. In today\u2019s questioning Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg compared the controversy over the constitutionality of ACA to similar arguments about Social Security back in the 1930s. It\u2019s also comparable to the shrieking over Medicare in the \u201960s. The ACA differs, though, because it is requiring people to buy a product from a private business, which in many states enjoys near-monopoly status. (They can opt instead to pay a fine, and that option, according to some lines of SCOTUS questioning, may be what saves the mandate in court)\nRemembering that the individual mandate came from the right \u2013 as an alternative to a government program, to protect the massive insurance industry \u2013 is just another reminder of how often Democrats sabotage themselves by moving to the middle, adopting Republicans\u2019 \u201ccompromise\u201d positions, only to see them walk away from their own idea. Robert Reich says that happens time and again :\nBecause Republicans have mastered the art of political jujitsu. Their strategy has been to demonize government and seek to privatize everything that might otherwise be a public program financed by tax dollars (see Paul Ryan\u2019s plan for turning Medicare into vouchers). Then they go to court and argue that any mandatory purchase is unconstitutional because it exceeds the government\u2019s authority.\nThe individual mandate may survive anyway. In later questioning Justice Anthony Kennedy noted that the law doesn\u2019t actually force anyone into the health care market; because laws require hospitals to provide care regardless of ability to pay, the uninsured are \u201cin the market\u201d already and \u201ccreating a risk.\u201d No one can reliably predict how the court will come down on this question. What we do know is that a single payer system would stand up to constitutional scrutiny \u2013 the anti-ACA plaintiffs admitted as much \u2013 and save a lot of money. Progressives should use the fact that even conservatives don\u2019t want citizens forced into the rapacious insurance market to make the case that letting them buy into Medicare is more efficient and humane, as well as constitutional. And certainly if the individual mandate is declared unconstitutional, that has to be the new demand.\nI talked about the ACA arguments today on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cPolitics Nation\u201d with Rev.

Yet, as Andrew Leonard detailed on Tuesday , it\u2019s at this very moment when the legislation is starting to extend coverage and reduce costs that the Supreme Court seems determined to destroy it.\nAs the justices debate constitutionality of the legislation, we want to know how the law is affecting regular Americans.

Once-ludicrous opinions might carry the day\nTopics: Supreme Court , Healthcare Reform\nWednesday\u2019s Supreme Court arguments on the Affordable Care Act involved complex technical issues of \u201cseverability\u201d and \u201cconditional federal spending,\u201d so let\u2019s get right to the core issue. The judges are being asked to take away health insurance from millions of people. And judging from what they said, they just might do it. Constitutional arguments that were clear howlers a few days ago now have a chance at becoming the law of the land.\nThe severability issue presupposes that the Court is going to accept the stupid arguments against the mandate. If it does, the Court must decide how much of the rest of the statute has to be struck down as well? The answer depends on how much of it Congress would have passed had it known it could not enact the mandate. The Obama administration claims that if the Court strikes down the mandate that individuals purchase insurance, it must also invalidate the prohibition against insurers discriminating against people with preexisting conditions, and the law\u2019s limitations on how insurers can set rates. Its opponents want to throw out the whole thing. The Court had to appoint a lawyer itself in order to hear arguments that the rest of the law could work without the mandate, because there are other mechanisms, such as subsidies, to encourage young, healthy people to buy insurance.\nThe most extreme view was that of Justice Antonin Scalia: \u201cMy approach would be to say that if you take the heart out of this statute, the statute\u2019s gone.\u201d But that approach runs into the obvious difficulty that this huge bill contains provisions that have nothing to do with the mandate, such as improvements in Native American healthcare and the extension of benefits for black-lung victims. Pulling apart the obviously irrelevant bits is a huge task. Justice Stephen Breyer asked, \u201cWhat do you propose that we do other than spend a year reading all this?\u201d Even Scalia got a laugh when he asked, \u201cYou really want us to go through these 2,700 pages?\u201d\nEdwin Kneedler, arguing for the United States, pointed out that some provisions are already in effect without the mandate: 2.5 million people under 26 have gotten new coverage, for \u00a0example. Scalia speculated that this was in anticipation of the mandate, and would otherwise bankrupt the insurers, but Kneedler and Justice Sotomayor both pointed out that this is lousy economics: Those healthy people are a net benefit for insurance companies.\nThe complexities of severability may actually strengthen the case for the mandate, as Lyle Denniston pointed out , because they show what a huge task the Court would be taking on if it struck down the mandate. Scalia\u2019s extreme position, if he sticks to it, may also help the mandate in another way, by convincing the other justices that he\u2019s nuts and will say anything to strike down the ACA.\nThe federal spending issue turns on the expansion of Medicaid. Under the ACA, millions of the working poor \u2013 people with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level \u2013 are eligible for Medicaid. From 2014 to 2016, the federal government will pay 100 percent of the costs. Then its share decreases, to 90 percent after 2020. Because the ACA also gives states assistance with their new administrative costs, overall state spending will actually be lowered.\nTwenty-six states are claiming that this conditional spending unconstitutionally coerces them, because they cannot realistically forgo the money, and because if they refuse to expand their rolls, they might lose every cent of Medicaid money. But let\u2019s be clear: This is not about the states wanting to conserve their own money. It is about the states refusing to spend federal money, to help people that they do not want to help. (Paul Clement, the attorney for the challenging states, declared that his argument would not change if the federal government permanently paid 100 percent of the costs.)\nAs a legal matter, this is the craziest argument yet, which is why it was rejected by every lower court that heard it. It implies that, when states get federal money, they have a right to spend it any way they want, with no federal conditions. \u00a0It means that Medicaid itself has always been unconstitutional, along with federal unemployment benefits, highway funds, education funds and many other programs. Justice Breyer repeatedly pointed out that the provision in the Medicaid statute that is being challenged has been there since 1965.\nYet the conservative justices took it remarkably seriously. Because the federal government \u201chas the authority under this provision to say you lose everything,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts declared, \u201cit seems to be a significant intrusion on the sovereign interests of the state.\u201d Justice Anthony Kennedy said, \u201cThere\u2019s no realistic choice.\u201d Justice Scalia offered the astounding claim that \u201cif you predict \u2026 that 100 percent of the States will accept it, that sounds like coercion.\u201d If this is right, then if I offer 10 people triple their salaries to come work for me, and I can confidently predict that they will all accept, I am coercing them. \u00a0Alito endorsed the same idea, and also thought it relevant that the money \u201cis going to have to come out of the same taxpayers that the States have to tax to get their money.\u201d \u00a0That would mean that the federal tax code is itself an invasion of states\u2019 rights. How long must we keep a straight face when presented with this stuff?\nThere was a legitimate basis for the Court to consider many of the issues raised by the healthcare law, since they had divided the lower federal courts and the law needed clarification. But the Medicaid claim created no division: Every lower court agreed that it was without merit. (Just how meritless is explained at length in a characteristically lucid piece by Marty Lederman.) Even the most preposterous arguments are magically elevated to respectability if they are arrayed against the ACA.\nThe Medicaid issue also calls attention to the political decisions that were made here \u2013 the decision of all those Republican officeholders to join this litigation. Why would you work so hard to deny decent medical care to working poor people in your own state? Political warfare evidently produces collateral damage. Obama owns the healthcare bill, so anything that can gum up its works is a Republican victory \u2013 and all 26 of the state challengers, attorney generals and governors, are Republicans. But all those working poor people are not Democratic Party operatives. They are ordinary folk trying to get by. The decision to pursue this litigation displays a calculated viciousness and cruelty that we have not seen in American politics in some time.

If The Supreme Court does not find this monster unconstitutional.", "explanation": null, "document": "Source:\nhttp://www.gopusa.com/commentary/2012/03/20/faria-obamacare-politics-and-constitutionality/\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010), more commonly referred to as ObamaCare, has become one of the most controversial pieces of legislation passed by the Democrat-controlled, 111th U.S. Congress during President Obama\u2019s administration.\nDespite significant political opposition and poll-after-poll evincing the American people\u2019s strong dissatisfaction with a health care plan that was correctly seen as further socializing American medicine, ObamaCare was passed by the two houses of the U.S. Congress and signed into law by the president on March 23, 2010.\nOne stated goal of the plan is ostensibly to \"expand access to insurance for nearly 30 million Americans\" (photo, above). And to accomplish this \u201dreform,\u201d the Obama administration has introduced the elements of compulsion \u2014 and more ominously, unconstitutional powers.\nTo increase access to insurance for 30 million uninsured Americans, ObamaCare forces insurance companies and managed care plans to extend coverage to people with pre-existing conditions; in effect, converting conventional rules of indemnity coverage (i.e., coverage for unforeseen medical illnesses and injuries) into prepayment for chronic medical care.\nBut perhaps the most egregious section of ObamaCare is to force uninsured Americans to purchase medical insurance. Noncompliance with this \u201creform\u201d will trigger heavy fines imposed by the federal government as a penalty. This is referred to as the health insurance mandate, and it is quite different from National Health Insurance as in Canada (2,3,11), National Health Service as in Great Britain (6), or socialized medicine in France, Germany, and Japan.(12,16)\u00a0 Thus, I make a relative distinction between the Obama administration\u2019s plan for health care as corporate socialized medicine (i.e., public-private, corporativist partnerships) and the fully socialized medicine as in most European countries.(7-10)\nThe price of socialized medicine in every country in which it has been implemented is the usurpation of liberty, the erosion of individual autonomy, the gradual loss of the freedom to choose \u2014 working in parallel with the rationing of medical services and technology because the raison d'\u00eatre of socialism is to control the population by depriving the people of freedom and keeping them subservient and dependent on the State.\nThe free enterprise system in the United States has traditionally relied on free choice in a free market place, whether we are talking about buying a home, an automobile, computers \u2014 or medical care. Government compulsion and social engineering are not well received by free marketeers and individualists in our society.\nSmall steps, incremental \u201creforms,\u201d have taken place in American medicine via increased rules and regulations regarding utilization and rationing of services, coverage, and payments to physicians, etc. But further large-scale attempts to socialize American medicine have been repeatedly defeated since 1965, when Medicare (i.e., health care for the elderly) and Medicaid (i.e., health care for the indigent) were instituted.(4,5,9) A good example of this rejection of socialized medicine was the failed attempt by President Bill Clinton to revamp the U.S. health care system in 1993-1994. The Health Security Act of 1993 was a grandiose effort to further socialized American medicine in a corporativist direction,(8-10) and was dubbed \"HillaryCare\" because the effort was led by former First Lady Hillary Clinton (photo, above), who serves today as President Obama's Secretary of State.\nIf there was so much opposition to ObamaCare, how did it get through Congress?\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress in September 2009 when the Democrat Party still had majorities in both Houses of the American Congress. Despite those majorities, the Republican Party (GOP; \u201cGrand Old Party\u201d) was able to introduce several amendments and mount significant opposition to the legislation.\nObamaCare passed in the House of Representatives on October 8, 2009. The Senate then took up consideration of the bill and passed it \u201cwith amendment\u201d on December 24, 2009.\nAccording to the U.S. Constitution, when a bill that has already been passed by one house of congress is altered or has amendments added to it by the other house, then the bill must return to the originating house to be re-voted on and passed again with those changes or amendments. Because the Senate version of the ObamaCare bill passed \u201cwith amendment,\u201d the bill had to go back to the House of Representatives to be reconsidered and re-voted on.\nLikewise, if the House made any further changes or added any new amendments, the bill would then bounce back to the Senate for a re-vote. This process may seem unnecessarily cumbersome to foreigners, but the American Founding Fathers in their wisdom devised this method so that thoughtful consideration could be given to the making and passage of laws, and thus, hopefully preserve our constitutional republic.\nHowever, the legislative shenanigans used by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and her counterpart in the U.S. Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), to get the amended ObamaCare legislation finally through congress turned that process upside down. Even the Washington Post, not usually considered a \u201cconservative\u201d publication, astoundingly reported that Speaker Pelosi was willing to do anything to ram the bill through Congress in 2010.(13)\nTime was of the essence because 2010 was also a mid-term election year in the United States. Given the growing voter dissatisfaction with the Obama administration, the slow economic recovery, and the mounting opposition to this bill (photo, left), the makeup of one or both houses of congress could potentially change in early 2011. This political consideration added great urgency to the need to get ObamaCare passed once and for all and signed into law before any of the newly elected congressional members were sworn in.\nSo, here is what transpired:\nIn 1974, Congress created a special methodology for balancing the budget, whereby the U.S. Senate could reduce the escalating budget deficit with a simple majority vote (i.e., 51 votes), rather than requiring the usual 60 votes that are needed to stop a filibuster.\u00a0Under this Senate rule, the expediting process was called \"reconciliation,\" but it was only to be used for balancing the budget.\nFirst, President Obama and his Democrat congressional leaders, Pelosi and Reid, attempted to change the rules to effect passage of this legislation at any price. They used budget \"reconciliation\" rules to bypass the planned GOP Senate filibuster that would normally have allowed the Republicans to defeat the legislation with 41 Senate votes. (The 41-vote possibility became a potential reality when Massachusetts elected a Republican, Scott Brown, to the U.S. Senate on January 19, 2010.)\nSecond, the Democrat congressional leaders invoked a convoluted concept of \"procedural rules,\" to make sure one way or the other President Obama could get this cherished piece of legislation through Congress (photo, right).\nThe Washington Post article expounded the convoluted methodology as follows:\n\"Rather than passing the Senate bill and then passing the fixes, the House will pass the fixes under a rule that says the House \"deems\" the Senate bill passed after the House passes the fixes.\n\"The virtue of this, for Pelosi's members, is that they don't actually vote on the Senate bill. They only vote on the reconciliation package. But their vote on the reconciliation package functions as a vote on the Senate bill...the bottom line is this: When the House votes on the reconciliation fixes, the Senate bill is passed, even if the Senate hasn't voted on the reconciliation fixes, and even though the House never specifically voted on the Senate bill.\"(13)\nAnd that convoluted way of thinking did not even include Speaker Pelosi's \u201cmost revealing\u201d comment expressed during an interview on Fox News on March 9, 2010: \"We have to pass the health care bill so that you can find out what is in it.\"(15)\nSo, to make the story brief, the socialist members in the U.S. Congress were willing to do anything to pass and have signed into law what Vladimir Lenin deemed \"the keystone in the arch of socialism\" \u2014 government control of medical care!\nThe ObamaCare legislation again passed in U.S. House of Representatives on March 21, 2010 by a\ntight vote of 219-212, with 34 Democrats and all 178 Republicans voting against the bill! President Obama signed it into law two days later (photo, left).\nThe fact that the legislation was quickly repealed in a largely symbolic gesture by the newly elected House in a 245-189 vote that January 2011 tells how unpopular the law was and remains. President Obama was happy to take credit for ObamaCare when he thought the American people would approve of it with time; but in the intervening years that has not happened. Therefore, many of President Obama's followers are now distancing themselves from the law they helped create!\nViolating the U.S. Constitution to Justify ObamaCare\nThe U.S. Constitution, unlike the constitutions in other countries or other forms of government, limits the power of the federal government to specifically enumerated powers. Powers that are not specifically granted by the constitution are not authorized. Additionally, the first Ten Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, enshrined as the Bill of Rights, even forbid Congress from passing laws restricting individual freedom. For example, the First Amendment reads, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" The Second Amendment forbids the government from disarming law-abiding citizens, etc.\nIt has been stated that the \"Welfare Clause\" in the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress to distribute entitlements and to redistribute wealth in the form of socialism. But in discussing this clause, Thomas Jefferson wrote, \"a distinct substantive power, to do any act which might tend to the general welfare, is to render all the enumerations [of their specific constitutional powers] useless, and to make their power unlimited.\"\nAnd James Madison, the \u201cFather of the U.S. Constitution,\u201d in a letter to fellow patriot Edmund Pendleton dated January 21, 1792, wrote: \"[If] Congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money, and will promote the General Welfare, the Government is no longer a limited one, possessing enumerated powers, but an indefinite one, subject to particular exceptions.\" In other words, there is no authorization in the U.S. Constitution for the implementation of socialism in America.\nLikewise, our constitution does not authorize the federal government to take over the U.S. health care system. To legally justify the implementation of ObamaCare, particularly the section that forces American citizens to buy health care coverage, congressional democrats and the president have used the (interstate) commerce clause of the constitution (that empowers congress to regulate the interstate commerce among the individual states of the nation).\nAgain, this \"broad construction\" (interpretation) of the constitution is tantamount to a usurpation of power that would erase the limits of authority set for the federal government by the framers of our constitution. Nor have specific contravening amendments been passed to legally alter those constitutional limits.\nThe limits have been exceeded only by the judicial activism of court rulings, based on the two aforementioned broad interpretations of the \u201cGeneral Welfare\u201d and \u201cCommerce\u201d clauses. The intention of the Founders was never for congress or a complicit activist Supreme Court to use commerce and trade between the states to wantonly approve unconstitutional federal legislation.\nAs a result, a majority of the states acting individually, as well as numerous civic and professional organizations, have filed lawsuits in federal court challenging the constitutionality of ObamaCare.(1) The U.S. Supreme Court (photo, above) has agreed to review the lawsuits in March 2012 \u201cas part of the three days of public oral arguments scheduled for March 26-28. There, lawyers for the Obama administration and a coalition of 26 states and private groups will separately plead their case on the health care law's legal limits.\"(14)\nLet\u2019s hope reason and constitutionality prevail, and that at least part, if not all, of the most egregious sections of ObamaCare are declared unconstitutional and repealed by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nReferences\n"}, {"score": 942.2711, "uuid": "c36f68a6-4a6c-576b-aeed-cb0c1269a7ad", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1416wb-61-29081", "target_hostname": "www.senior.org", "target_uri": "http://www.senior.org/index.php/2-uncategorised-uncategorised/5-repeal-obamacare-goes-national", "page_rank": 1.1826083e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "The Seniors Coalition - \u201cRepeal <em>Obamacare</em>\u201d Goes National", "snippet": "Here&#x27;s the catch, <em>Medicare</em> premiums will most likely be hiked and nullify most, if not all, of <em>any</em> increase in your social security checks.

These will likely be based on the elements of typical small business plans of today, which generally include all of the services that he mentioned.\nHowever, his questioning left the impression that all policies must be comprehensive. That is far from accurate.\u2028\u00a0\u2028Americans will be able to satisfy the mandate to have health insurance with a number of different options.

The nonprofit and nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that the annual deductible could be as high as $6,350 .\u2028\u00a0\u2028And those under 30 can purchase even skimpier policies that cover only catastrophic expenses .\nLarry Levitt , head of Kaiser\u2019s Initiative on Health Reform and Private Insurance, thought the Supreme Court questioning could easily leave \u201cthe impression that the health care reform law was requiring people to buy Cadillac insurance.\u201d The bronze plan is more like a Mini Cooper with a much lower cost to match its smaller size.\nInexplicably, Verrilli failed to point this out in his response. He never mentioned bronze plans and never contradicted the implication that the law would make everyone buy top dollar coverage.\nObamacare is much less onerous than its opponents claim in other ways, as well. For example, opponents often portray the individual mandate as a new burden that every American will have to bear.\nIn reality, the vast majority of Americans either already has or would like to have health insurance. They would get it with or without the mandate. And the mandate exempts many of the rest. The Urban Institute , a prominent think tank, estimates that the law would force a mere 6 percent of Americans to ether obtain coverage they might otherwise have avoided or pay a penalty.\nVerrilli never made that point, either.\nIt\u2019s disappointing when a Supreme Court justice seems to misunderstand a key element of a case before him. But it\u2019s incomprehensible when an attorney in the case fails to offer a correction.\nThe Obama administration has done a woefully poor job of explaining its signature policy initiative to the American public. Its communication strategy before the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t seem to be much better.\nTo check out more Check Up items go to www.philly.com/checkup\nPosted by Robert Field @ 10:51 AM Permalink | File Under: Robert Field | 3 comments\n3\n"}, {"score": 934.23395, "uuid": "cd96c0ba-7644-5d59-8413-51936c1bc6ef", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0610wb-09-15669", "target_hostname": "www.thenewamerican.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/4196-the-new-world-of-obamacare", "page_rank": 1.1913108e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "The New World of <em>ObamaCare</em>", "snippet": "When Uncle Sam <em>is</em> footing the bill for Americans\u2019 healthcare, they\u2019d <em>better</em> do as he says or else.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nBy now most Americans are familiar with the broad outline of ObamaCare: Everyone is required by law to purchase health insurance, with a tax penalty assessed upon those who fail to comply. Insurers may not refuse to cover those with pre-existing conditions nor charge them higher rates. The federal government is expanding its role in providing health insurance. And did I mention that all of this is supposedly going to reduce both healthcare costs and the federal deficit?\nOf course, with a law that is over 900 pages long and contains hundreds of mandates, it may be months or even years before all the ramifications of the law are understood. Some of the mandates are already widely known, such as the requirement that chain restaurants post nutrition information about their menu items or the 10-percent tax on tanning salon services. However, it may very well be that the less widely known portions of the law are also the most dangerous, which may explain why they were kept out of public view in contravention of candidate Barack Obama\u2019s repeated assurances that the entire healthcare debate would be conducted in public and broadcast on C-Span.\nAmong the obscure but dangerous provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the official \u2014 and disingenuous \u2014 name for ObamaCare) are numerous provisions that, said Art Thompson, CEO of The John Birch Society, \u201cwill intrude on every aspect of life in America, from cradle to grave.\u201d They include everything from a national healthcare strategy to home visitations by government agents, possibly including forced immunizations, to \u201cCommunity Transformation Grants\u201d \u2014 all designed to alter Americans\u2019 lifestyles to conform to the whims of bureaucrats in Washington.\nThe law itself is (probably intentionally) vague about how all these mandates are to be carried out; the details are left mostly to federal agencies that are much less accountable to the voters than Congress. Therefore, many of the suggestions in the following paragraphs as to how these mandates will play out are based not on explicit language in the legislation itself, or (obviously) the yet-to-be-issued regulations, but on an informed understanding of how governments can turn seemingly beneficent laws into tools of oppression. If anything, much of what is suggested in this article is actually less radical than what President Obama and fellow Democrats have said they wish to accomplish, namely a single-payer* health insurance scheme at the federal level.\nObama himself, in a 2003 speech, said that he\u2019d \u201clike to see\u201d the United States adopt a \u201csingle-payer health care plan, a universal health care plan.\u201d\nHis Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, of course, attempted to foist a single-payer government healthcare system on Americans back in 1993 and \u201994. Many other Clinton administration figures are prominent members of the Obama -administration.\nRevolutionary Appointee\nObama\u2019s recently appointed head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Donald Berwick, has openly praised the British National Health Service for not leaving healthcare to \u201cplay out in the darkness of private enterprise.\u201d Berwick added that \u201cany healthcare that is just, equitable, civilized, and humane must, must redistribute wealth from the richer among us to the poorer and the less fortunate. Excellent healthcare is by definition redistributional.\u201d Berwick is also a proponent of government rationing\u2020 of healthcare, saying, \u201cThe decision is not whether or not we will ration care. The decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.\u201d Tellingly, Obama took the occasion of a Senate recess to appoint Berwick, bypassing Senate confirmation hearings that would surely have publicized Berwick\u2019s socialized-medicine bona fides and possibly have sunk his nomination.\nThus, it is almost impossible to be too alarmist about the intentions of Obama-Care and its proponents. When government controls the healthcare system from top to bottom, it is naturally going to attempt to manipulate every aspect of people\u2019s lives in order to keep costs down; and for those who become ill despite the state\u2019s best efforts to force them to be healthy, care can \u2014 and will \u2014 be denied. This is already happening in Berwick\u2019s beloved British healthcare system, where, for example, life-saving drugs are withheld from patients because the government deems them too costly \u2014 and then threatens patients who try to purchase the drugs out of their own pockets with the loss of all their healthcare benefits (see \u201cPaying Patients Test British Health Care System,\u201d the New York Times, Feb. 21, 2008).\nMassive New Bureaucracy\nPerhaps the most ominous of the obscure-but-dangerous provisions in Obama-Care is found in Sections 3011 through 3015. This portion of the law instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \u201cestablish a national strategy to improve the delivery of health care services, patient health outcomes, and population health.\u201d Along with the strategy, the law requires \u201ca comprehensive strategic plan to achieve the priorities\u201d established by Congress. The strategic plan includes \u201cagency-specific strategic plans to achieve national priorities,\u201d \u201cannual benchmarks for each relevant agency,\u201d and \u201cstrategies to align public and private payers with regard to quality and patient safety efforts.\u201d In short, the federal government is going to micromanage the healthcare sector in an effort to achieve its desired outcomes, and it is going to force private insurers to participate in this micromanagement \u2014 part of the price they will pay for having Uncle Sam hand them a captive market.\nIn order to implement the national strategy, the law instructs the President to \u201cconvene a working group to be known as the Interagency Working Group on Health Care Quality.\u201d This new bureaucracy includes senior-level representatives from 23 named federal agencies \u201cand any other Federal agencies and departments \u2026 as determined by the President.\u201d Among the agencies included in the working group are the Department of Commerce, the Coast Guard, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Labor, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Education \u2014 a strong indication that this is concerned with far more than simply ensuring that patients are treated well.\nLikewise, Section 4001 of the act instructs the President to \u201cestablish, within the Department of Health and Human Services, a council to be known as the \u2018National Prevention, Health Promotion and Public Health Council.\u2019\u201d President Obama issued an executive order to carry out this provision on June 10.\nThe council is chaired by the Surgeon General and consists of senior-level representatives from 12 named federal agencies and \u201cthe head of any other Federal agency that the chairperson determines is appropriate.\u201d\nThe purposes of the council include: (1) to coordinate \u201cprevention, wellness and health promotion practices\u201d; (2) to \u201cdevelop a national prevention, health promotion, public health, and integrative health care strategy\u201d; (3) to \u201cprovide recommendations to the President and Congress concerning \u2026 changes in Federal policy to achieve national wellness, health promotion, and public health goals, including the reduction of tobacco use, sedentary behavior, and poor nutrition\u201d; and (4) to propose policies \u201cfor the promotion of transformative models of prevention, integrative health, and public health on individual and community levels across the United States.\u201d There will be \u201ca list of national priorities\u201d and \u201cspecific science-based initiatives\u201d to \u201caddress lifestyle behavior modification\u201d with regard to \u201csmoking cessation, proper nutrition, appropriate exercise, mental health, behavioral health, substance use disorder, and domestic violence screenings.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horror even to think that they would put that in there, that they are going to start regulating personal behavior,\u201d Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), himself a physician, told The New American. \u201cBut these people believe in it, and this is why it\u2019s so bad to allow government to get inside the door.... They get their foot in the door, and then they say, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re paying for it, so we\u2019re going to tell you how to live.\u2019\u201d\nIn other words, ObamaCare has just turned the United States into one giant psychiatric laboratory, and Americans are the rats stuck inside and subjected to \u201cbehavior modification\u201d until we stop smoking (wonder if this applies to the President, who still hasn\u2019t kicked the habit), take our vaccines and stop eating Twinkies, take up jogging, quit ingesting substances that the big pharmaceutical companies can\u2019t patent, and tell Uncle Sam when we stopped beating our wives. Is this really what all those folks clamoring for healthcare reform wanted? If so, it serves as further proof of H.L. Mencken\u2019s maxim that \u201cdemocracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.\u201d\nSection 4101 provides for grants for school-based health centers, which will offer \u201ccomprehensive health assessments, diagnosis, and treatment of minor, acute, and chronic medical conditions\u201d and \u201cmental health and substance use disorder assessments, crisis intervention, counseling, treatment, and referral to a continuum of services including emergency psychiatric care, community support programs, inpatient care, and outpatient programs.\u201d\nWill parents\u2019 rights be respected in all this? Will their children be treated without their knowledge?\nThe \u201cprimary function\u201d of existing school-based health centers \u201cis to circumvent parental involvement in the important area of directing a child\u2019s healthcare,\u201d Gregory Hession, a Massachusetts attorney specializing in family and juvenile law, said in an e-mail. The programs \u201csexualize children with condom giveaways, homosexual advocacy programs, and age-inappropriate instruction to children, even very young ones, about sexual activity,\u201d said Hession. \u201cThese clinics even allow and promote statutory rape\u201d and refer students to abortion clinics and provide transportation to the clinics, Hession added, pointing out that all of this is done \u201cin complete secrecy.\u201d\nAnd what of mental health assessments? Hession stated that much of the mental health screening that already takes place in schools appears to be \u201cfostered by psychiatrists with financial ties to large drug companies that offer psychotropic drugs which are almost invariably prescribed for any small perceived personality problem,\u201d the result being \u201cthat many children are now required, as a contingency for attending school, to take powerful psychotropic drugs for such invented maladies as attention deficit disorder.\u201d\nWith school-based health clinics already engaged in such unsavory practices, federal funding and mandates can only lead to even worse, and more widespread, abuses.\nGovernment Into Almost Everything\nNothing less than the \u201ctransformation\u201d of communities is the modest goal of Section 4201, which creates a grant program for state and local governments and nonprofit organizations \u201cto reduce chronic disease rates, prevent the development of secondary conditions, address health disparities, and develop a stronger evidence-base of effective prevention programming.\u201d Each grantee must develop a \u201ccommunity transformation plan\u201d which may include such things as:\n1. creating healthier school environments, including increasing healthy food options, physical activity opportunities, promotion of healthy lifestyle, emotional wellness, and prevention curricula, and activities to prevent chronic diseases;\n2. creating the infrastructure to support active living and access to nutritious foods in a safe environment;\n3. developing and promoting programs targeting a variety of age levels to increase access to nutrition, physical activity and smoking cessation, improve social and emotional wellness, enhance safety in a community, or address any other chronic disease priority area identified by the grantee;\n4. assessing and implementing worksite wellness programming and incentives;\n5. working to highlight healthy options at restaurants and other food venues;\n6. prioritizing strategies to reduce racial and ethnic disparities, including social, economic, and geographic determinants of health; and\n7. addressing special populations needs, including all age groups and individuals with disabilities, and individuals in both urban and rural areas.\nImagine telling the Founding Fathers that the federal government would someday be concerning itself with restaurant menus and workplace stress! They would have laughed you right out of Philadelphia. Yet here we are, with the feds doing just that and much, much more.\nJust what is \u201cemotional wellness,\u201d and how is the government going to see to it that people attain it? Surely it isn\u2019t by cutting bureaucracy and spending, bringing the troops home, and reducing taxes, though those are the surest ways to make (almost) everyone happier.\nPresident Obama, in a 2007 Democratic primary debate at Dartmouth College, stated his support for a national smoking ban if local bans fail to snuff out the habit. It makes sense, then, that his signature achievement would include language plainly calling for \u201csmoking cessation.\u201d When Uncle Sam is footing the bill for Americans\u2019 healthcare, they\u2019d better do as he says or else. Indeed, the British Health Secretary, in charge of that single-payer system that Berwick so adores, ruled in 2007 that smokers would henceforth \u201cbe denied operations unless they give up cigarettes for at least four weeks beforehand,\u201d according to the Daily Mail; their doctors would be in charge of enforcing the rule by making them take blood tests to prove they\u2019ve not lit up for the last month. Surely the ObamaCare administrators can come up with some similarly clever ways of coercing Americans to can their Camels.\nThen there\u2019s that business about \u201creducing disparities.\u201d The intention, undoubtedly, is to see to it that those who do not have health insurance receive it \u2014 and that those who have too much of it, as Washington sees it, are forced to make do with less; hence the tax penalties applied to so-called Cadillac plans. Subsidizing insurance for some will only encourage them to make more use of the healthcare system, putting upward pressure on prices and hastening the day that Berwick and others of his ilk begin rationing care for them. Punishing those with the best insurance plans will ensure that some of those individuals are unable to afford the care they need, which is just rationing by other means. The result: We all end up in the mushy middle, with just as much care as the government deems necessary to keep us from being too much of a strain on the system. For those who do become too ill and therefore too expensive for the government to keep, denial of treatment is an easy fix.\nIndividuals who use community health centers funded by the government may also be given a government-sanctioned \u201cindividualized wellness plan\u201d under Section 4206, which establishes a demonstration project for this purpose. Undoubtedly this will be declared a success, and soon all Americans can expect a Washington-mandated plan for their lives, to control such things as alcohol and tobacco use, weight, blood pressure, nutritional supplement usage (but only those supplements \u201cthat have health claims approved by the Secretary\u201d), stress, and exercise.\nInvading Homes and Schools\nOne need not go to a health clinic to be subjected to federal healthcare intrusions, either. At least two portions of the act actually provide for government agents to come into individuals\u2019 homes to see to it that they are obeying Washington\u2019s directives.\nThe first of these is Section 2951, entitled \u201cMaternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Programs.\u201d This section requires all states to perform a needs assessment that identifies at-risk communities and \u201cthe quality and capacity of existing programs or initiatives for early childhood home visitation.\u201d States can then apply for grants to establish early childhood home visitation programs.\nThe programs will target high-risk communities first, with \u201chigh-risk\u201d defined as \u201celigible families who reside in communities in need of such services,\u201d followed by eligible families with low incomes, pregnant women under 21 years old, \u201ca history of child abuse or neglect \u2026 or interactions with child welfare services\u201d (not evidence of actual abuse, mind you; just a visit from government agents on an anonymous tip will suffice), \u201ca history of substance abuse,\u201d \u201cusers of tobacco products\u201d (light up and expect a visit from your friendly neighborhood G-man), \u201cchildren with low student achievement,\u201d \u201cchildren with developmental delays or disabilities,\u201d or \u201cindividuals who are serving or formerly served in the Armed Forces.\u201d That just about covers everyone.\n\u201cThis section of the law is designed to circumvent the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and give government agents a plausible excuse to enter homes without a warrant, with the ultimate goal of reporting the family to child protective services,\u201d said Hession. The child-protection agents then have every incentive to take children from their families, as evidenced by the fact that over half a million children are now in child protection agency custody in the United States.\nThe law lays out specific desired outcomes for individual families, many of which sound good. Who could oppose improvements in mothers\u2019 and babies\u2019 health, children\u2019s development, parenting skills, school readiness and academic achievement, crime and domestic violence rates, and family economic self-sufficiency? The detailed regulations established by federal and state bureaucrats to accomplish these general outcomes, however, may not be so benign.\nFor example, what specific \u201cimprovements in parenting skills\u201d might government agents wish to impose on those they visit? Will spanking children or even speaking sharply to them be permitted? What if parents try to inculcate specific moral or religious precepts in their children? Hession noted that homeschoolers and parents who believe in corporal punishment are already among the most targeted by state child protection agencies.\nIt is already known that government programs to improve school readiness are of little benefit. Gains made in Head Start, the most famous of these programs, do not last much beyond first grade. Why, then, would anyone expect the government to be able to offer parents expert advice on how to prepare their children for school?\nWorse yet, how will \u201cschool readiness\u201d and \u201cchild academic achievement\u201d be measured? What will happen to families whose children fail to meet the government\u2019s arbitrary standards? As the Birch Society\u2019s Art Thompson perceptively pointed out,\nThe idea of school readiness and academic achievement provides the excuse for government agents to nullify parental prerogatives for private and home schooling. Since they can test the preschool children, mold the tests of how and what the children should be taught, they can use this information to try and force you to send your children to government institutions.\nIn fact, school readiness is one of the key reasons boosters of universal pre-kindergarten cite for their support of extending government schooling to an earlier age. Among those who favor universal pre-kindergarten are Hillary Clinton \u2014 she of \u201cIt Takes a Village to Raise a Child\u201d and the anti-parental-rights Children\u2019s Defense Fund \u2014 and President Obama. Prima facie evidence that it\u2019s a bad idea.\nGovernment has been the greatest enemy of \u201cfamily economic self-sufficiency,\u201d having replaced fathers with welfare checks and having taxed Americans to the point that both parents frequently must work outside the home just to make ends meet. Government benefits from families who are dependent on it because those same people will almost always vote for even bigger government, as inner-city voting patterns demonstrate.\nIt is of little comfort that the law requires that states provide assurances that \u201cthe participation of each eligible family in the program is voluntary.\u201d As Hession said, existing \u201cfamily visitation programs are about as voluntary as the current IRS tax system, which continues to assert that it is based on voluntary compliance.\u201d\nEven if it were the case, at least for now, that families are not required to admit government agents into their homes under this program, given that the target families at the beginning (most likely single mothers, according to Hession) are likely to have less education and fewer resources to fight back, how likely are they to resist a bureaucrat who offers them a check or other assistance just for answering a few questions? Once they are caught in the state\u2019s web, how easily will they be able to extricate themselves? After all, one of the desired outcomes for individual families is that they be more easily referred to \u201cother community resources and supports \u2026 consistent with State child welfare agency training.\u201d Then how long will it be until the program is expanded to other families and made mandatory? The dangers here are immense.\nAs if that weren\u2019t bad enough, Section 4204 actually provides for home visits from government functionaries for the purpose of providing immunizations (a demonstration program for the time being but with the intent \u201cto continue and expand such program\u201d).\nThe recent H1N1 hoopla demonstrates how the government, with the enthusiastic backing of vaccine manufacturers, can manufacture a health crisis and then use it to encourage or even force people to be vaccinated. The Washington Post reported on June 4 that two separate reports from Europe \u201caccused the [World Health Organization] of exaggerating the threat posed by the virus and failing to disclose possible influence by the pharmaceutical industry on its recommendations for how countries should respond.\u201d That exaggeration of the so-called pandemic and the WHO\u2019s accompanying recommendations led many Americans to be vaccinated needlessly, including some who were coerced by the government, such as healthcare workers in New York.\nNow imagine that same scenario playing out under a program in which the federal government gives grants to states to (1) provide \u201cimmunization reminders or recalls for target populations,\u201d (2) educate \u201ctargeted populations and health care providers concerning immunizations in combination with one or more other interventions,\u201d (3) subsidize immunizations, (4) promote immunizations, (5) provide for \u201chome visits\u201d that may include \u201cprovision of immunization,\u201d and (6) create an electronic database for all states to access immunization records \u2014 all provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act. How easy it would be for governments to find out who hasn\u2019t volunteered to be vaccinated and to show up at the recalcitrant citizens\u2019 homes to give them their shots right then and there! How profitable it would be for vaccine manufacturers!\nIndeed, Dr. Paul said that \u201cone thing that we have found in the past is some of the strongest proponents of massive inoculations\u201d have been funded by pharmaceutical companies. The decision to immunize or not to immunize, he said, \u201cshould be strictly a decision made by the doctor and the patient, and never by public health officials.\u201d\nPaul expressed particular concern that ObamaCare will come between doctors and patients. Decisions about treatment, he said, \u201cwill be made not by other M.D.\u2019s, but they will be made by people who are pushing a pencil.... And there will be rationing of care \u2026 by those people in Washington, the bureaucrats who are looking at a bottom line and not understanding the situation.\u201d\nPeople Control, Not Healthcare\nFrom page 1 to page 906, ObamaCare is chock full of expensive, intrusive, and downright scary programs such as these. The law gives the federal and state governments virtually unlimited power to interfere in Americans\u2019 lives, even within the confines of our own homes. (Hession noted that the act \u201cis marbled with requirements that can be accomplished only by entry into private family homes.\u201d) It destroys individual self-reliance and, through a variety of provisions such as school-based health clinics and home visitation programs, the family unit. These are the foundations of the American Republic; without them the United States will become a society of helpless, dependent sheep with neither the desire nor the will to resist the state\u2019s relentless encroachments on our liberties.\nThese problems cannot be fixed merely by modifying a clause here and a proviso there. ObamaCare needs to be repealed in full before it can metastasize into a full-blown single-payer system. State-by-state nullification should also be undertaken. Then we can work on dismantling the rest of the federal healthcare behemoth. These are the only cures for what ails the American healthcare system.\n* \u201cSingle payer\u201d is the innocuous code for government-run, bureaucrat-controlled, nationalized, socialized medicine.\n\u2020 Although \u201crationing\u201d may have a more negative connotation than \u201csingle payer,\u201d it is nonetheless euphemistic. What it means in healthcare is that treatment will be determined not by the physician according to the needs of the patient, but according to formulas and edicts issued by the government and carried out by administrators and bureaucrats.\nTrackback (0)\n"}, {"score": 923.45386, "uuid": "3f11c2f2-5dd7-5060-a676-24be0466bc17", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0202wb-10-23796", "target_hostname": "www.heritage.org", "target_uri": "http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/medicare-drifting-toward-disaster", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>Medicare</em>: Drifting Toward Disaster", "snippet": "The problem <em>is</em> beyond the fact that medical cost growth <em>is</em> faster <em>than</em> that of <em>any</em> other part of the economy.

The presence of so many of you here shows that you understand the need to focus on Medi\u00adcare more than just once a year when the Medicare Trustees' report is issued.\nI am Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute, a public policy research organization that focuses on free-market ideas for health reform. We are co-sponsoring this event with our colleagues from The Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute. We also welcome the CMS Network as well as the Kaiser Network. They are broadcasting this event from the Newseum as a Webcast, which will be available later today on KaiserNetwork.org, as well as at Galen.org and Heritage.org.\nWe also are very pleased to welcome Senator John Breaux and Secretary Mike Leavitt, plus a distin\u00adguished panel of experts to discuss the future of Medi\u00adcare. Secretary Leavitt titled his talk \"Drifting Toward Disaster.\" He has been refining his address personally until the early hours of this morning, showing his ded\u00adication to this issue. Following his address, our distin\u00adguished panel will discuss solutions for Medicare's sustainability. [1]\nThe Secretary will talk to us about the magnitude of the problem, and our panelists will be talking about big picture solutions.

MOFFIT, PH.D.: Ladies and gentle\u00admen, on behalf of my colleagues at The Heritage Foundation, I also want to welcome you to this important forum.\nPoliticians think about the next election. States\u00admen think about the next generation. Senator John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, is a statesman. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1972 at the age of 28, then the youngest member of Con\u00adgress. He was then elected in 1986 to fill the seat of Senator Russell Long of Louisiana and began a stel\u00adlar career as a champion of bipartisanship in the United States Senate.\nSenator Breaux rose to prominence as a member of the Senate Finance Committee and was a leader in welfare reform and tax reform. But it is in the area of entitlements where he made his greatest name. As Chairman of the Committee on Aging, Senator Breaux highlighted the importance of strengthening both Social Security and Medicare. In 1998, he was selected by President Clinton and House and Senate leaders to chair the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.\nSince his retirement from the Senate in 2005, he has remained a steady voice of reason and a source of wise counsel for Republicans and Dem\u00adocrats alike. It is my honor to give you Senator John Breaux.\nHON. JOHN BREAUX: Thank you very much Bob. Thank you for your contributions over the years and for your continued work in this area.\nGood morning to all of you. What a great crowd. And we have a great panel. I am delighted to be here to present-not to introduce, but to present-to you the Secretary of HHS. We all know of his great work. He promised me that right after he fixed Medicare, he was going to go out and fix Medicaid. And then right after that, he would fix the problem of the uninsured. And after that, he will fix the VA and then provide universal care for all of us. So it is going to be a busy day. But with his determination, I am sure it can get done.\nWhat we really need in this area is truly not all that complicated. When I was on the Senate Finance Committee, we would have almost endless hearings with the Secretary on Medicare reform. Group after group would also come before the Finance Committee and say, \"Senator, you have got to fix Medicare. Fix it, but do not cut my benefits. Fix it, but do not increase my premiums. Fix it, but make sure you do not increase the eligibility age. But, darn it, fix it!\"\nThe problem obviously is that the things that you have to consider, the things that you have to look at, and the things that you have to do require not more books-except maybe books on political courage.\nWe should have a forum on political courage: how you get it, and how you keep it. It's how you make reform work. Because the great challenges fac\u00ading Congress reflect a great deal about the politics of our government and how we go about solving these challenges. There are great suggestions on how to fix Medicare. But the real issue is the political ability to make those very tough decisions by a political body that runs for office on a regular basis. It is very difficult.\nWe made recommendations on the Medicare Commission. Some of them were good. Some of them were enacted. The prescription drug program in Part D was part of that; it has been a great success. So I am really delighted to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to see if we can get this done. Everybody can take credit for getting it done. What Secretary Mike Leavitt brings to the table is an understanding that comes from being a Governor, from being a Cabinet Secretary, and from being a person who is really committed to health care in this country. His is the type of leadership that both sides of the political aisle can appreciate. He is a man both sides can listen to, and can find the political courage necessary to accomplish that task.\nHe knows the subject. In addition, he brings the commitment and the political leadership. Ultimate\u00adly, this is the greatest challenge as we look at reform\u00ading health care in this country. So, I am delighted to present to you the Honorable Michael Leavitt, Sec\u00adretary of HHS.\nHON. MICHAEL O. LEAVITT: I want to begin by explaining my motivation for giving this speech. Our nation has made a promise to provide health care to our seniors. I am going to speak critically of our current course. I don't want to see us fail. To keep this commitment requires change. Time is running out. Medicare is drifting toward disaster.\nI am a Trustee of the Medicare Trust Fund. On March 26 I attended what will likely be my last annual spring meeting of the Trustees. Our primary business was to issue a report to the people on the condition of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. The report is based on work by the govern\u00adment actuaries.\nIn the Treasury conference room we use there is a wall clock that has been there since 1873. At one time, the clock was actually hooked to the Western Union telegraph line which calibrated the exact time on a regular basis.\nThis year, Rick Foster, the chief Medicare actuary, sat in perfect alignment between me and the clock. As Rick gave his report that the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund was projected to be insolvent in 2019, I could see time passing with each swing of the clock's pendulum: ticktock, ticktock.\nI'm not sure if that caused what I am going to describe to you, but as I listened I felt the weight of this responsibility pressing on me. When the report was finished, the final page of the report was passed around for our signatures.\nIt felt like the moment required more than just signing my name and moving on to the next appointment. This is serious business involving tril\u00adlions of dollars and the lives of hundreds of millions of people.\nAs much as anything, the weight was a blend of responsibility and selfish panic. I realized that when the actuaries' forecast matures-and it will-some\u00adbody is going to say to me, \"Weren't you a Trustee of the system for four years? What did you do to address the problem?\" Somehow, the response \"I signed the report each year\" just doesn't feel ade\u00adquate. Though the truth is, that's about all the authority the Trustees are given.\nJust before the vote to accept the report, I asked the Secretary of the Treasury, Hank Paulson, the managing trustee, if he would keep the record of the meeting open because there were some things I just felt a need to say. He agreed.\nMy remarks today are a response to my discom\u00adfort, and I plan to submit them as part of the min\u00adutes of the March 26 Trustees' meeting.\n\"Scouting the Rapids\"\nI have constructed a metaphor in my mind that is useful in describing our dilemma with the Medi\u00adcare entitlement program, which I will share with you today.\nWhitewater canoeing at the championship level is high adventure and comes with serious dangers. My friend, Matt Knot, is an instructor and guide on the Gauley River in West Virginia.\nThere are treacherous places in whitewater coun\u00adtry. Canoers call them hydraulics. They are given descriptive names like \"Hungry Mother\" or \"Lunch Counter\" that dramatically communicate danger.\nHydraulics form when water pours over an obsta\u00adcle like a rock. Unwary canoeists get sucked into them and can be trapped in one place by the force of the current. They are instantly overwhelmed and dragged under by the whirlpool effect created.\nMatt says when you go into a hydraulic every\u00adthing gets very dark as you are pulled deeper. Water circulates the boat back to the surface and then drags it down again, over and over. Survival depends on keeping your wits, waiting-and hop\u00ading-to be flushed out the bottom.\nSome thrill-seeking river runners find the expe\u00adrience of navigating a hydraulic exhilarating. How\u00adever, the worst hydraulics are known as \"keepers.\" Boaters become victims when they get sucked down into a hydraulic, and instead of being tossed about for a while and flushed out from the bottom, they get mired in a jungle of debris, which has also been sucked into the same hole.\nThis is an important point to remember: it is not just the hydraulic that brings fatal consequences; it is the combination of the hydraulic and debris that isn't evident.\nMatt teaches students to anticipate. He calls it \"scouting the river.\" Scouting is more than looking ahead. It's listening for the roar and sensing when the current is pulling you toward a dangerous place.\nHere's the second important point. Safety comes only in foresight and avoidance. Matt says, \"You have to start positioning your canoe well ahead of the danger, commit to a course that avoids the dan\u00adgerous area, and then paddle hard.\"\nI'm sure it is obvious to you that the river in my metaphor is the growing obligation our nation has to the pay for the health care of our senior and disabled citizens. Medicare's liabilities have grown from a mere trickle 40 years ago into what Matt Knot would call \"Class 5 rapids.\" As new streamlets merge, it is becoming a raging torrent-more demanding and dangerous with each successive day.\nThe Medicare Trustees' Report does a good job of \"scouting the rapids.\" But a nation that does not act on the warnings it contains is no different than a canoeist ignoring evidence of hydraulics in the river ahead.\nThe disaster is not inevitable. If we act now, we can change the outcome. In health care, the core problem is that costs are rising significantly faster than costs in the economy as a whole.\nRising Costs, Aging Population\nHealth care has done exactly that for my entire life. When I was born, it was 4 percent of the econ\u00adomy. When my son was born, it had doubled to 8 percent. When my first grandson was born two years ago, it had doubled again to 16 percent.\nEvery piece of evidence shows the trend continu\u00ading. The problem is beyond the fact that medical cost growth is faster than that of any other part of the economy. Our problem is also demographic. Our population is aging and as we age, medical expenses grow. Today, 12 percent of the population is 65 or older. By 2030, nearly 20 percent of us will be seniors. There is nothing we can do to change that.\nWe have made a decision in our society that the cost of seniors' health care will be borne primarily by younger people who are still working. When that decision was made, it was assumed there would always be a fresh crop of earners to support the health care of their parents. That is not proving to be true. The demographic reality is there are diminish\u00ading numbers of workers per senior, and this ratio will decline rapidly once the \"baby boom\" genera\u00adtion reaches Medicare eligibility age starting in 2011.\nIn preparing to deliver this speech, I had econo\u00admists, actuaries, and demographers developing detailed scenarios demonstrating how this will unfold. I then spent hours-writing draft after draft-looking for the right combination of facts to illustrate our dilemma. I've concluded today, that such a fact-filled analysis is unnecessary. Most of you have done the math yourself and know the simple truth: Higher and higher costs are being borne by fewer and fewer people. Sooner or later, this formula implodes.\nThe real pressure on this problem starts between now and 2019, when the Medicare Hospital Insur\u00adance Trust Fund is projected to become insolvent. There is no backup plan in the law to ensure that hospitals continue to be paid when the Trust Fund is depleted.\nCongress will not be able to sit idly by and allow the Medicare program to become insolvent-they will be forced to take action. They will have the old familiar choices of raising taxes, cutting benefits to seniors, or imposing reduced payment rates on health care providers. Some of these choices repre\u00adsent the ugliest of political dilemmas, pitting a gen\u00aderation of workers against their parents and grandparents.\nI have a son who is 30. He and his wife are just beginning their household. They have one young daughter and another baby on the way. They are in many ways becoming a typical American house\u00adhold. This is a wonderful thing to see as a parent, but I worry about our national economic future; I worry about our coming generational divide.\nLet's consider what their generation's economic prospects look like over the next two decades. The typical household is going to see its health care spending basically double in the next twenty years-from 23 percent to 41 percent of total com\u00adpensation. At the same time, we are going to nearly double the share of federal spending that goes to pay for Medicare, from 13 percent to more than 23 percent. And we are going to do this while the num\u00adber of working people per Medicare beneficiary is sliced nearly in half, from 4 to 2 and a half.\nThat is clearly not a rosy scenario for growing young households like my son's. These working families will argue, \"My generation did not agree to this arrangement. This is happening at a time when my own health care is unaffordable. I have children who need food and clothes. I'm struggling to make ends meet. Seniors need to either have lower bene\u00adfits or pay more of the cost themselves.\" In fact, they will insist, \"We are the ones with the heavy burden. Government needs to help us more so we can con\u00adtinue to work and enjoy what our parents did.\"\nBut their parents and grandparents will have legitimate worries too. They will argue, \"I did my time. I paid into the system. I have a legal entitle\u00adment for health care, and the government has a moral obligation to provide it. I know the demo\u00adgraphics have changed, but that isn't my problem.\" In fact, seniors will argue, \"Health care costs are so high, my Medicare premiums, co-pays and deduct\u00adibles are eating up almost half of my Social Security check. You need to help us more, not less.\"\nThe problem is: both will be right. The problems we see today with Medicare have the power to pit these parents and children against each other in an intergenerational economic struggle where each side will suffer.\nFrighteningly, we will see that competition for resources play out much like another economic ten\u00adsion we are already experiencing. Our choices about social investment-in infrastructure, education, national defense-are being reduced as mandatory spending crowds out discretionary spending. In the last two decades, we've gone from half of our national spending being discretionary to only 38 percent. In four years, it is projected to be down to less than one-third.\nWe are seeing mandatory health care expenses crowd out other government spending-just as we are going to see health care spending crowd out non-health care spending in American households.\nBy now the current has grown so much that we are being sucked down into the hydraulic whirlpool again and again, with little surface time for air. The debris is piling up, and we may not have a way out.\nWould it be a stretch to say 20 years hence, we would likely have accumulated a substantially larger national debt than we have now; and that a significant portion of that debt would be in the hands of foreign capital sources? Again, that's our current course.\nOther nations, of course, have scouted out the river. What will the impact be of continued trade deficits, and new global competitors who spend a fraction of what we do on health care, yet produce similar or better big picture health results?\nWe factor continued growth into our scenario like it is certainty. Without continued investment from private and public sources, our prosperity would be taken away.\nI was in Singapore the week before last. Their health care system consumes 4 percent of their gross domestic product. Rather than a Medicare-like government system, they require citizens to save. Incidentally, the Singaporean life expectancy is slightly longer than it is in the United States.\nI would simply ask this question. If you were considering between an investment in two organi\u00adzations and one spent 4 percent on health care with no future liability and the other spent 16 percent and had trillions of dollars of unfunded obligations, which one would you be most interested in?\nIn the late 1990s, I was Governor of Utah, and went to Argentina to develop trade relationships. I met various ministers of the Argentine government who, at the time, were proposing some aggressive and controversial changes. Among these was an attempt to transition their country away from a con\u00adstitutionally protected pension system, their version of entitlements.\nI remember thinking, \"These are the most coura\u00adgeous political leaders I've ever met.\" I soon found it was not just courage. They were compelled.\nThinking the Impossible\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Argentina was one of the wealthiest countries in the world- wealthier even than the United States. Over the next fifty years, successive governments construct\u00aded, and then expanded, an ever-generous system of social benefits, nationalized industries, and created a vast and bloated public administration. Yet pro\u00adtectionist policies and a failure to invest in innova\u00adtion in agriculture and other key industries meant the world economy began to change while Argenti\u00adna's didn't. Its productivity suffered. But the coun\u00adtry kept on spending, content and confident it was better-off than its neighbors.\nAs it turns out, Argentina had been operating for many years on money borrowed from the financial markets and organizations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. By the 1990s, the mortgage outstripped the country's ability to pay. Creditors told Argentina, \"No more, unless you fix your entitlements.\"\nFrankly, Argentina had started down the path of reform late, and once the government started, the political pain was too much-the nation could not sustain it. The government developed a solid mon\u00adetary policy, but could not change its fiscal or spending practices.\nA few years later, Argentina was in political tur\u00admoil, with a rapid succession of governments, a cur\u00adrency in free-fall, and a rapid spike in unemployment. The country teetered on the verge of civil unrest. Why? Because Argentines had put off hard choices for so long they were forced to make change too quickly, and they simply didn't have the political strength to do it.\nIt seems inconceivable that the United States of America, the strongest economic power in human history, the land of the free and the home of the brave, could ever be in a situation like the one Argentina faced a decade ago. But, is it?\nLet's think on a horizon of twenty years.\nIs it hard to conceive of a severe productivity dip in the United States as labor markets become more sophisticated in nations like China, Vietnam, India, and Brazil? They are increasingly competing not only with our manufacturing sectors but also with our more dynamic knowledge sectors.\nIs it really difficult to imagine world credit mar\u00adkets saying to the United States of America-as the world did to Argentina: \"Given your lack of action in dealing with your deficit and the entitlements causing the problem, we are beginning to lack con\u00adfidence in you\"?\nWhen we talk about the metaphoric torrent we are navigating, it is much more than just Medicare, of course. The massive burden we are feeling is cre\u00adated by a full 16 percent of our gross domestic prod\u00aduct rushing through a single sector of the economy. We need changes that can affect this entire sector we call health care.\nBut there is a very close relationship between Medicare and the balance of the U.S. health sector. Medicare is such a powerful payer; the rest of the sector has based their billing and reimbursement mechanisms on Medicare.\nI believe the key to health care reform in our nation is Medicare reform. Successfully changing Medicare will trigger the rest of the health care sec\u00adtor to follow. That would be better news if changing Medicare were not so politically and bureaucratical\u00adly complicated.\nSounding the Alarm\nSince I am speaking in my capacity as a Trustee of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds today, it is important to acknowledge that this job is about sounding the alarm. I hope I have made clear to you just how alarmed I am and how alarmed we should all be. There is serious danger here. It trou\u00adbles me that this matter is not receiving more atten\u00adtion in the presidential candidates' discussions. The next President will have to deal with this in signifi\u00adcant part. In fact, if they don't deal with it, our opportunity to apply Matt Knot's strategy of reposi\u00adtioning early and paddling hard is lost.\nSo, given the strong possibility this won't get fixed in the next 266 days, I would like to add some general advice on the creation of a political con\u00adstruct for action and a general strategy to solve the problem. I want to add, these are not being present\u00aded as Administration policies or proposals. I take complete responsibility for them as a Trustee simply laying out my thoughts.\nTo get this done, we will have to do three things: separate the commitment from the pain, pick the right moment, and modernize the budget scoring conventions.\nSeparate Commitment from Pain. I believe there will need to be some trigger points built into legis\u00adlation so members of Congress are not casting a vote to take specific measures but rather laying contin\u00adgent plans if things go beyond a predetermined point. For example, if Medicare exceeds more than a defined percentage of the gross domestic product, some combination of actions would be automatical\u00adly triggered and could be overridden only by a dif\u00adficult to obtain super-majority.\nNext, pick the right moment. It will be necessary for Congress to acknowledge that bi-partisan action is required. The usual legislative process won't ever produce enough bi-partisanship to deal with this problem. The way election cycles operate now, only a few months separate the time one election cycle ends and the next one begins.\nSenators like Judd Gregg and Kent Conrad have offered bi-partisan legislation creating a special leg\u00adislative process similar to those relating to military base closures. My sense is that such arrangements need to be put into place during windows of time when control of political power is sufficiently uncertain that both major parties feel at risk. To suc\u00adceed, the rules of such a process would need to be the product of a larger consensus requiring both parties to operate under them regardless of whether they were in the majority or minority.\nFinally, modernize scoring conventions. Many of the tools Congress will need to reform Medicare will involve significant behavioral changes and require investments that traditional scoring conventions would count solely as expenditures. In an age when the power of investment and productivity are the keys to success, the federal scoring conventions overvalue the status quo while undervaluing the investments that could transform it.\nSo far this morning, I have talked about the seri\u00adous imperative our nation has to change the course of Medicare.\nI also discussed several parts of a political con\u00adstruct that would allow political action.\nNow I would like to frame up, at a high level, what a solution should look like from my perspec\u00adtive. I'm ready to break into song on this matter, but will restrain myself. However, if you find this pre\u00adview interesting, I would enjoy sharing it in more detail with you at another time.\nA Medicare system solvent through the 21st cen\u00adtury would have three characteristics. First, value of care would replace volume of care as Medicare's best-rewarded virtue. Second, Medicare parts A and B would operate like Part D. Third, each generation would carry its share of the load.\n1) Value of care would replace volume of care as Medicare's best rewarded virtue.\nIn Medicare, our most expensive patients are those with multiple chronic diseases. The combina\u00adtion of ailments compounds to magnify each other. The same is true with Medicare. Medicare has three chronic ailments that are defeating the system.\nThe first, I call Silo Syndrome: Each medical action is paid for separately. That provides little opportunity or incentive for coordination among providers and it often results in bad referral deci\u00adsions, sloppy hand-offs, duplications, fraud, and poor quality of care. The result is inappropriate care and unnecessary cost.\nMedicare needs to use its power as the nation's biggest payer to change this. It's not only wasteful but it encourages unnecessary care and expensive medical mistakes.\nThe second category is Quality Indifference: Doc\u00adtors, hospitals, and other medical providers are paid at the same rates for low-quality or high-quality per\u00adformance. Physicians who take measures that pre\u00advent acute flare-ups of chronic conditions are paid no more than those who don't. Skilled nursing facil\u00adities that prevent unnecessary re-hospitalizations are paid the same as those that don't. In fact, poor quality is often rewarded. When patients contract preventable hospital infections, costs skyrocket and in most settings, the hospital profits from it. Not only is our current system quality-indifferent, we reward poor quality!\nPatients deserve to know the quality of the care they receive according to standards set by the experts. The information should be transparent, and most of all, we should reward quality.\nThis leads naturally to the third category: Chronic More. There are no mechanisms or incentives for controlling the volume and intensity of care. Not for the patient or the provider. The entire process rewards volume. Doctor and hospital incomes rise as more units of service are ordered. If those units are more costly, they generate even more revenue.\nIt is the same for a patient. Our current payment system provides no means for a patient to know the cost and little reason to care.\nThese volume incentives need to be treated with strong doses of information transparency and by building incentives for high quality, efficient care directly into our payment structure. A variety of policies would force these changes, and luckily the infrastructure of quality metrics and strategies for rewarding value are available. It just takes congres\u00adsional action.\n2) Make Medicare Parts A and B more like Medicare Part D.\nIn addition to changing the incentives from vol\u00adume-rewarding to value-rewarding, the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program provides a good example of how better transparency and competi\u00adtion can drive change. It has not only ensured that seniors get the drugs they need, it has also demon\u00adstrated that seniors can use an organized market\u00adplace to drive quality up and cost down.\nToday, 90 percent of those who are eligible have drug coverage; satisfaction rates are high; and the cost is almost 40 percent below the original esti\u00admates. While there are several things that have con\u00adtributed to the drop, a big one is the power of a competitive marketplace. Prices are determined through competition. The cost of the benefit is transparent to consumers and they can choose the benefits that meet their needs.\nIf the Medicare Part D structure were applied to Medicare Parts A and B, it would revolutionize the entire system. Imagine a physician practice invest\u00ading resources to monitor and track patients with chronic conditions. They might if the program pro\u00advided a beneficiary information on the quality of their care and dollar savings if they used more effective providers. It would drive quality up and cost down.\n3) Each generation needs to do its share.\nMy father and mother are on Medicare. They worked hard all their lives and have done well. My dad likely earns more than the 30-year-old son I told you about earlier. He is struggling to buy a home, support his family, save for the children's col\u00adlege fund, and buy his health insurance. Yet, my son has taxes drawn from each paycheck to subsidize my parent's health insurance.\nMedicare can be made more efficient by reward\u00ading value and shifting to a PartD-like competitive model of delivery. However, what remains as the most important obstacle is rebalancing the genera\u00adtional obligation.\nThis is a classic public policy decision that has to be faced. It is simply unreasonable to think Medi\u00adcare can be sustained unless this is changed. If we start now, the change can be made over time and with genuine fairness. We can avoid an intergenera\u00adtional economic struggle from which both sides suf\u00adfer. Promises to today's and future beneficiaries to provide coverage of health care must be kept, but not at the expense of future generations.\nConclusion\nMedicare is indeed drifting toward disaster, but we know what to do. Matt Knot's river advice is the key: \"Start positioning your boat well head of the danger, commit to a course that averts the problem, and paddle hard.\"\nEvery generation of Americans has overcome chal\u00adlenges to secure our nation's role as the world's eco\u00adnomic leader. I believe solving the health care puzzle is this generation's challenge. It will require change.\nIn a global market there are three ways to approach change. You can fight it and fail; you can accept it and survive; or you can lead it and prosper.\nWe are the United States of America. Let us lead.\n[1] Panelists included Robert Berenson, M.D., Senior Fellow at the Urban Institute ( urban.org); Stuart M.

The mandate requiring that all Americans purchase health coverage is sure to be found unconstitutional.\nSome caution is warranted: How the Court will ultimately rule is not yet set in sto ne . The questions asked don\u2019t always signify what action a justice will take, and all that is required is for just one conservative member of the court to join the four more liberal-minded justices for the law to survive. But for the moment, a sense of dismay is spreading quickly through the community of Obamacare supporters. Many sharp legal minds on the left believed that the Court was unlikely to strike down the mandate, to the point that one could almost smell the complacency. As of noon on Tuesday, that complacency is gone.\nThe timing could not possibly be worse. Even as polls continue to show that more Americans oppose the healthcare reform law than support it, two years after President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, there is increasing evidence the measure has finally started to deliver some benefits.\nIn June 2011, 2.5 million more young adults had health insurance than in September 2010, a direct consequence of parents now being allowed to keep their children on their own healthcare insurance until age 26. Prescription drugs are more affordable for the elderly. Millions of Americans now have access to free preventive healthcare. Children with preexisting conditions can no longer be denied coverage.\nBut confirmation of perhaps the most important benefit of healthcare reform came just last week, in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine investigating the reasons for the surprising slowdown in Medicare cost acceleration recorded over the last two years.\nIf there is one point on which budget wonks on both the left and right agree, it is that the long-term growth in Medicare costs poses by far the greatest threat to the finances of the U.S. government and the health of the American economy. If the trends in place over the last four decades continue indefinitely, Medicare spending will suck up every last cent of federal revenues by 2060.\nBut in the last two years, that trend line has changed significantly. Instead of growing faster than overall economic growth, Medicare spending is now roughly in line with existing growth. The Congressional Budget Office has sharply reduced its estimates for Medicare spending over the next 10 years. Part of the change is due to the recession; people have trimmed their spending on healthcare, along with everything else. But part of it is also due to the changes in how the healthcare industry operates that are a consequence of parts of the healthcare reform law that have not even been fully implemented.\nFrom the NEJM:\nThe Affordable Care Act permanently slows the growth in Medicare payment rates for almost every category of provider other than physicians and makes additional targeted cuts to home health agencies and some other providers. As a result, the CBO projects that over the next decade Medicare spending per enrollee will grow substantially more slowly than the overall economy\u2026\n\u2026 In site visits and interviews conducted for our ongoing qualitative research, the Center for Studying Health System Change found strong provider interest in payment reform and efforts to prepare for it,with the prospect of increasing constraint on Medicare payment rates cited as motivation. We see a combination of reformed delivery of care and broader units of payment as having the potential to allow providers to generate savings through steps that are less threatening to quality of care and access than are cuts in payment rates.\n(Emphasis mine). In other words, because the industry knows that that it won\u2019t be able to just hike up its prices at will in the future and still get reimbursed by the government, it is now looking hard for ways to cut costs. And that\u2019s really, really important. Slower growth in Medicare spending may not be as flashy an achievement as expanding coverage to 2.5 million youngsters or cutting prescription drug costs by $3 billion, but it is an absolutely crucial step toward bringing a halt to the unconstrained growth of federal healthcare spending.\nShould the Supreme Court be considering such issues when deciding how to rule? By the letter of the law, probably not \u2014 and there may not even be a direct connection between the individual mandate and the constraints on Medicare payment rates, unless the Court decides to strike down the entire law after finding the mandate unconstitutional. Perhaps a more interesting question is whether the polling numbers for Obamacare would improve if more people understood the long-term consequences of the law for the federal balance book. But that\u2019s not clear either. The latest New York Times poll shows that huge majorities of Americans support individual elements of Obamacare: 85 percent support requiring that insurance companies cover preexisting conditions. Seventy-seven percent support lowering prescription drug costs of the elderly. Sixty-eight percent support allowing parents to keep their children under their own coverage until age 26.\nBut at the same time, 51 percent oppose the mandate, an essential piece in ensuring that there is sufficient revenue to pay for all the other goodies. If you are looking for a perfect example of how modern Americans feel about government today, there you have it. We want services, but refuse to pay what they cost.\nAfter a year in which the Obama administration seemed to have forgotten its most important legislative achievement, the White House is now making a new push to explain the benefits of reform and rally support. The political calculus is easy to understand. In a campaign during which Democrats will be attempting to paint the Republican nominee as a flag-bearer for the 1 percent, the benefits of healthcare reform for middle-class Americans struggling to pay up the bills should be relatively easy to point out. The irony, or tragedy, of this all is that this long-delayed resuscitation comes at a point at which the prospects that the law will survive its legal challenges have never seemed worse.\n"}, {"score": 918.1876, "uuid": "e418b680-1907-5d30-af19-604aa2fb777f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1515wb-98-14037", "target_hostname": "www.arktimes.com", "target_uri": "http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2012/01/31/republicans-choice-champions-of-obamacare", "page_rank": 1.2376586e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Republicans&#x27; choice: champions of &#x27;<em>Obamacare</em>&#x27; | Arkansas Blog", "snippet": "Posted by Eureka Springs on January 31, 2012 at 11:03 AM The part of <em>Obamacare</em> that <em>is</em> too strong <em>is</em> the $2,000 penalty per employee for companies with more <em>than</em> 50 employees.

They are solidly on record in support of the same \u2014 even more draconian, if you are inclined that way on the issue \u2014 health care solutions.\nRead on:\nBy Ernest Dumas\nPoor Rick Santorum could only shrug in frustration when he complained in the Florida debate about the supreme irony of the 2012 presidential race: Republicans made President Obama vulnerable two years ago by demonizing his health-insurance reforms and now they are about to nominate one of two men who cannot effectively use the issue against him.\n\u201cFolks,\u201d Santorum said, \u201cwe can\u2019t give this issue away in this election.\u201d\nThat is exactly what they are doing.\nIf you hate the idea of requiring uninsured people to buy health insurance or pay a penalty, which is the main attack on the health law, then you have to be appalled by Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. They favored, and Romney implemented, more draconian measures than are in Obama\u2019s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\nIt is safe to say that were it not for the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans call \u201cObamacare,\u201d President Obama would be flying pretty high. No, he has not fully repaired the wreckage of the George W. Bush years, except perhaps in foreign affairs, but it was the political disaster of health reform in 2009-10 that brought him down from his post-election popularity and made him assailable. Universal health insurance had enjoyed massive public support, but the confusing and messy fight to get it past a Republican filibuster in the Senate and the nasty advertising campaign against it by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and right-wing groups left the bill and the president who urged its passage unpopular.\nAll the Republican candidates for president began their campaigns by attacking the new health law and promising to repeal it as their first act if they are elected. The president cannot repeal a law but can only urge Congress to do so.\nThe GOP race has come down to Romney, who authored the Massachusetts insurance law that is the template for the Affordable Care Act, and Newt Gingrich, who championed its key provision, the mandate that large businesses and individuals who can afford it buy private health health insurance or pay a penalty. Both men said repeatedly that people should not be allowed to shift their medical costs to the insured by avoiding health insurance.\nListen to Gingrich in a 2005 interview on National Public Radio where he promoted a national law to require people to buy insurance: \u201cOur goal has to be for 100 percent of the country to be in the insurance system.\u201d The government might offer tax credits and vouchers as an inducement, he said, but it should include a requirement that if you have at least a modest income you must buy insurance or post a substantial bond to cover extraordinary medical expenses if you get sick or have an accident.\nBoth men have finessed the issue in the Republican race by saying they would try to repeal the act if they are elected although they do not offer cogent reasons for doing so. Romney merely explains that it was very good to require people in Massachusetts to buy insurance but it is not necessarily good for the rest of the country. He cannot explain why. Gingrich first denied favoring an insurance mandate but finally admitted that he had and that he had seen the light. As late as last summer he was saying that people should be forced to post a big bond if they didn\u2019t buy an insurance policy. Now he thinks that might be unconstitutional.\nRomney defended his own version of Obamacare in Massachusetts when Santorum assailed him in the Florida debate. He said people in Massachusetts still liked his plan, which he said was different from Obama\u2019s.\nHe is right. His was tougher on businesses and individuals. A side-by-side comparison:\n\u2022 Romneycare requires people to buy insurance or pay a penalty of up to $1,200 a year. Obamacare will require them to pay a penalty of only $95 in 2014 if they don\u2019t purchase insurance. It would go up to $695 a year in 2016, a little more than half the Romney penalty. Insurance companies say the Obama penalty is so small it won\u2019t force people to get insured.\n\u2022 Romneycare provides a government subsidy to people who earn less than 300 percent of the poverty line. Obama will help people with family incomes up to 400 percent of the poverty line.\n\u2022 Romney requires all companies with 11 or more employees to make a \u201creasonable\u201d contribution toward insurance for the workers or pay a penalty of $295 per employee. Obama\u2019s law exempts companies with fewer than 50 full-time employees, and if they do not share insurance costs with their workers they will have to pay a penalty of $2,000 per employee. Obamacare gives companies that have fewer than 25 employees tax credits of up to 50 percent of their contribution if they enroll their workers in insurance and if average wages are below $50,000 a year.\n\u2022 Both provide for state exchanges where insurance companies will supply people a range of insurance options. (Republicans blocked that plan in Arkansas. The federal government will set up the exchange for Arkansans.) Both share other big features, like protecting people with pre-existing conditions from being cut off by insurance carriers and allowing children to stay on their parents\u2019 policies until they are 26.\nGingrich and Romney talk about their eagerness to debate Barack Obama. Not on health care.\nIn his 2009 pre-campaign book, Gingrich explains the mandate concept in what would become Obamacare: \u201cAllowing individuals to pass their health costs on to others reinforces the attitude that their health is not their problem and adds to the irresponsible, unhealthy behaviors that bankrupt the current system.\u201d There is no more eloquent defense of Obamacare.\nOh, and Santorum? Running for the U.S. Senate in 1994 he called for a federal law like the one sponsored by Republicans that year requiring people to buy health insurance to end the cost shifting. Now he thinks that\u2019s socialism.\n"}, {"score": 917.9325, "uuid": "85c32ac5-6467-5ea9-8c69-2883e794bdc1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0404wb-18-34623", "target_hostname": "patients.about.com", "target_uri": "http://patients.about.com/b/2011/12/03/ouch-an-anti-obamacare-conservative-strikes-back.htm", "page_rank": 1.1898e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "An Anti-<em>ObamaCare</em> Conservative Strikes Back", "snippet": "This panel has very little over site on it and they will be more interested in money <em>than</em> in our healthcare.

I am quite conservative when it comes to both financial and defense matters.\nBut socially my conscience tells me that having access to healthcare should not be predicated on whether someone has \"earned\" it.\u00a0 I look at healthcare much as I do an education:\u00a0 it should be a right of all citizens regardless of their socio-economic status or income.\u00a0 I do not believe healthcare should be socialized, but I do believe we should all be responsible citizens by participating in coverage whether it is public or private. Yes - that is the individual mandate and yes - I do believe it is our responsibility to cover ourselves and our families so that when a health problem rears its ugly head, we are not asking others to pay for it.\nNow - I realize that differing opinions is what makes the world go round, and I invite fair debate.\u00a0 Not only that, there have been times over the years when fair debate has suggested I re-evaluate my position.\u00a0 Yes, I've even been known to change my mind on occasion.\nBut this is NOT one of them. Brandon's retort to my post was so full of half-truths that I felt it was important to reply and provide him with some different perspective.\u00a0 So I wrote my comments, and tried to publish them on his site. Unfortunately my reply had too many characters, and About.com would not allow it to go through.\nTherefore, I share my reply with you here instead.\u00a0 You'll see how his arguments are misguided and why it is that we have such differing opinions.\nThen:\nBrandon,\n\u0095\u00a0 Your link to the GOP's \"healthcare plan\" is a link to its JOBS plan. You seem to think that healthcare is only a right for people who have jobs and that the Affordable Care Act will somehow inhibit the growth of jobs. I hate to point out the obvious, but when people are sick with no access to getting the treatment they need, they can't work.\nFurther, you failed to mention that not only will firms of fewer than 50 employees (96% of all American businesses) NOT be required to provide insurance , but that those who do provide it will get tax breaks for doing so.\u00a0 As a small business owner myself, that is a great incentive to me!\n\u0095\u00a0 You state that if you are unemployed, you will still be required to pay for health insurance. You failed to mention that you will also be subsidized to do so , ( example: a family of four can earn up to $89,400 per year and still have coverage payments subsidized ). For many, the net will be even.\nToday if you are unemployed, you have no coverage, and your family must go without, or pay from their pockets. Imagine how you'd feel if your daughter was diagnosed with leukemia, or your wife with breast cancer, and you couldn't afford for them to get treatment. The Affordable Care Act means that because your coverage will have been paid for, they will get the treatment they need.\nI'll also point out that if you are unemployed, you are still required to pay for auto insurance if you own a car, and you are still required to pay your homeowner's insurance if you have a mortgage...\u00a0 so, what's the difference?\n"}, {"score": 910.10504, "uuid": "c781d8da-d0b8-5fba-a7e5-831c58a5e76c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1117wb-85-08730", "target_hostname": "www.vimo.com", "target_uri": "http://www.vimo.com/blogs/consumer/medicaremedicaid/", "page_rank": 2.8176288e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "The Health Shopper \u00bb <em>Medicare</em>&#x2F;Medicaid", "snippet": "This <em>is</em> a <em>better</em> option <em>than</em> having a whole family with no coverage.

This seems to be particularly true for more rural as well as inner-city areas where overall coverage rates have generally been lower than suburban areas.\nAccording to the researchers, unemployment is the key factor in the trend. With unemployment, employer-provided coverage is usually terminated and due to the drop in income families and individuals often become newly qualified for public plans. Eligibility for health insurance plans has also been expanded, which helps push families and individuals in making the choice to go to public insurance. The research also uncovered an unfortunate situation: nationwide, about 9 percent of children do not have any type of coverage; over half of them are eligible for coverage through Medicaid and/or SCHIP.\n\u201cResearch demonstrates that most of these eligible children come from states with low participation rates and are disproportionately Hispanic. Because those who have health insurance are healthier overall and, more importantly, because healthy children are more likely to become healthy adults, focusing on covering eligible children should remain at the forefront of the nation\u2019s agenda,\u201d the researchers said.\nThe Real Cost of Prescription Drugs\nPosted by shreya , August 18th, 2011\nOn the whole prescription drug prices have been steady for some time and are projected to remain so through 2012. According to HHS, approximately 900,000 beneficiaries are currently receiving discounts of up to 50 percent on brand-name drugs through Medicare and have seen greater accessibility in generics.\nBut a recent study from NERA Economic Consulting reveals that seniors, particularly those on specialty tiers in their health plan, are currently \u201clargely unaware\u201d of the often-exorbitant costs of prescription drugs. \u201cSpecialty tiers\u201d, as defined by NERA, are separate prescription categories that include \u201chigher-cost, brand name medications\u2026 used to treat conditions like cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS and lupus\u201d.\nThe results of the study showed that Medicare consumers were not aware of Medicare Part D plans\u2019 differences in prices of medicines for more serious recurring issues. They also misjudged the out-of-pocket costs for specialty-tier medications and thought they would be paying a co-pay (as opposed to coinsurance) for a prescription drug on the specialty tier. Overall, Medicare beneficiaries underestimated the prices of prescription drugs but, even worse, were not certain how much they were paying for each drug.\nMedicare beneficiaries should consult with doctors and speak with Medicare or the provider directly before opting to use (and pay for) any prescription drugs.\nNewsbyte: Medicare Recipients May Not Be Aware of Reform Benefits\nPosted by admin , August 12th, 2011\nAs of Jan. 1, a variety of preventive screenings and services have been fully covered under Medicare. However, beneficiaries may not be fully aware of the new preventive services offered. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has acknowledged that public awareness of the benefits needs to be increased, and that more needs to be done despite continuing efforts.\nAccording to CMS, over 50 percent of Medicare beneficiaries utilized the new preventive screenings, but very few of the Medicare recipients have taken advantage of the Annual Wellness Visit, which includes consultations with health care providers to go over medical history, genetic inclinations, prescriptions, risk factors, choices for treatment, and to create screening schedules and take basic measurements.\nSome of the free screenings include:\nAnnual mammogram\nAnnual diabetes screening, twice a year for prediabetic patients\nColonoscopy every 10 years, every 2 years for high risk patients\nBone mass measurement every 2 years\nThe \u201cGlitch\u201d That Can Save $13 Billion\nPosted by shreya , July 26th, 2011\nResolving one minor \u201cglitch\u201d in the new health care law could save billions over 10 years. It would put under 1 million people out of Medicaid, which is a surprisingly small percentage of the almost 50 million on Medicaid as of 2009.\nExamination of Social Security benefits has been put forth as an alternative to simply providing early middle-income retirees from 62-65 Medicaid eligibility. Less than a million people would be affected by the legislation and about $13 billion would be saved over the next decade.\nOf those affected, half would still be eligible for subsidies on health care via state-run exchanges and a little under half a million people would be insured by their employers.\nLandmark Study: Health Insurance for the Poor\nPosted by shreya , July 8th, 2011\nEconomists and legislators\u2019 long-standing question has finally been addressed: Does health insurance for the poor really make a difference? As Medicare/Medicaid debts hit all-time highs , many states are cutting back their Medicaid programs. And while affordable health insurance remains a reach for the poor and uninsured, the first large-scale controlled study tackles the question of Medicaid\u2019s influence on the uninsured.\nProfessor of health economics at the Harvard School of Public Health Katherine Baicker and professor of economics at M.I.T. Amy Finkelstein conducted a groundbreaking study, thanks to a peculiar situation in Oregon. Low on money, Oregon wanted to grow its Medicaid program but could only provide for 10,000 new enrollments. When almost 90,000 uninsured applied the state had to select applicants by a lottery, setting the stage for Dr. Baicker and Dr. Finkelstein\u2019s study on the benefits of health insurance for the poor.\nUsing the uninsured applicants as a control group, the researchers asked those who had gotten Medicaid what difference the insurance made. The first phase of the study found vast differences between the two groups, and found that the insured had spent 25% more on medical costs. Under Medicaid, they were 35% more likely to see a doctor and 30% more likely to gain admission to a hospital, though there was no major change in ER use. Those who had insurance were also more likely to have a particular clinic and doctor they regularly checked in with.\nOutside of the numbers, insurance also reported feeling much better. They were more likely to partake in preventive care with women being 60% more likely to get mammograms. And insurance made a difference for the subjects\u2019 financial stability as well: those with Medicaid were 40% less likely to borrow money or fail to pay non-medical bills due to insurance costs.\nCurrently, the study is examining the health effects of health insurance. So far, 12,000 people have been interviewed and assessed for health via blood pressure, cholesterol, etc. Half of the interviewees are covered under Medicaid and half are not.\nDr. Baicker was surprised by the difference insurance made. \u201cBeing uninsured is incredibly stressful from a financial perspective, a psychological perspective, a physical perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a huge relief to people not to have to worry about it day in and day out.\u201d\nReport: Debt from Medicare, Medicaid to hit all-time highs\nPosted by shreya , June 29th, 2011\nThe Congressional Budget Office has some news on federal health care spending, and it\u2019s not all good: one projection asserts that federal health care spending could nearly double in the next two decades, comprising around 11% of the nation\u2019s GDP (currently 5.6%). A less optimistic projection of the health care budget presents the debt at 100% of GDP in the next decade, almost 200% by 2035.\nThe numbers are startling, but there\u2019s a catch: CBO is using pre-ObamaCare growth rates. Given the effects of the Affordable Care Act, from doctors\u2019 payment cuts to decreased insurance subsidies, CBO has stated that the level of federal health care spending would not be easy to maintain long-term.\nWith the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act currently up for debate in federal courts, what are your thoughts? Do you consider Medicare and Medicaid as a priority regardless of debt?\nConstitutionality of reform: Obama open to states\u2019 solutions\nPosted by shreya , March 10th, 2011\nIn light of attacks on the constitutionality of health care reform Obama has softened his stance on the law. He recently acknowledged the challenges involved in meeting the 2014 deadline and offered to back a proposal allowing states some leeway in implementing the major components of the law.\nThe president emphasized a section of the law that would allow states to construct their own variations of the reform law in 2017, as long as they retained the vision of the Affordable Care Act. He also said he would back a measure to push that deadline a bit closer, to 2014.\nCurrently under the health care reform law states are entrusted the task of creating health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, and reviewing abortion insurance. States have found that reform has qualified more people for Medicaid coverage. Furthermore they also cannot remove individuals from Medicaid, which occupies about a third of states\u2019 budgets currently, until the exchanges are in place which some feel will take an enormous toll on some states\u2019 budgets. In response to these concerns, Obama requested that a bipartisan commission be created in order to examine the situation and find ways to make the implementation more fiscally viable.\nCOBRA cancelled: what are the options now?\nPosted by shreya , October 6th, 2010\nAs of June, the 15-month, 65% COBRA health insurance premium subsidy was gone . For all those who\u2019d recently lost jobs, there was no cushion. Congress opted not to extend the legislation as keeping it until the end of the year would cost almost $8 billion.\nUnfortunately, this leaves the thousands of recently unemployed to bear the monthly premium on their own. However, hope is not lost. Here are some alternatives to COBRA for the unemployed that you might be interested in checking out:\n1. An insurance broker may be able to help you find an affordable health insurance plan. Consider a high-deductible plan, which tends to be cheaper. See getinsured.com for more options.\n2. You may be eligible for a government-sponsored plan. Some examples include Medicaid and CHIP. It might pay to research such programs to see if you\u2019re eligible.\n3. If you\u2019re under 26, you can get coverage under your parents\u2019 plan!\n4. It may help to distribute one family plan into multiple individual plans. This is a better option than having a whole family with no coverage.\n5. Consider a high-risk pool \u2013 these carriers typically cannot deny you due to a health problem.\nCommunity health centers expand with healthcare reform\nPosted by shreya , September 30th, 2010\nMost often located in rural or low income neighborhoods, community health centers have seen an increase in demand this decade.\nNow as part of healthcare reform, community health centers will double yet again. As per reform legislation, community health centers will receive another $11 billion in the next five years.\nA major portion of the 16 million people that will be newly insured by 2019 will receive coverage from Medicaid, a large chunk of whom will live in areas with community health centers.\nIn light of this skyrocketing demand and major expansion of community health centers, the biggest challenge will be staffing the centers. Community health centers may end up in competition with systems for physicians, assistants, nurses, social workers, counselors, etc. Part of the challenge is also incentivizing the centers for practitioners (though community health centers will be able to offer doctors $50,000 a year as opposed to $25,000, due to reform).\nQuick tip: use the ER as a last resort!\nPosted by shreya , September 3rd, 2010\nAccording to CDC\u2019s most recent data , one out of every five Americans visited the emergency room in 2007. Medicaid qualifiers and adults in \u201cfair or poor\u201d health, as well as people over 75, are the most frequent visitors of the E.R. In 2007, the top reasons for E.R. visits were upper respiratory infections, superficial injuries and sprains \u2013 all relatively minor problems. Patients without health insurance typically have E.R. bills that are considerably higher than those that are covered, yet nonemergency trips to the E.R. occur regardless of the type of insurance \u2013 private, Medicaid, or none \u2013 that the patient had.\nThe New York Times recommends calling a doctor before making the trip to the emergency room, or utilizing your provider\u2019s nurse hotline/doctor on-call feature. To explore your options with this feature/benefit and ensure your E.R. visits don\u2019t break the bank, visit getinsured.com and review your options.\n"}, {"score": 908.5579, "uuid": "b101bf42-fb25-5aed-9d0b-c523b1a81161", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0303wb-81-09573", "target_hostname": "www.thenewamerican.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/index.php/usnews/politics/3293-mitt-romneys-magic-act-creating-the-illusion-romneycare-is-different-from-obamacare", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "from <em>Obamacare</em>", "snippet": "<em>Any</em> talk by liberals about Masscare and <em>Obamacare</em> being identiacal <em>is</em> purely political and <em>is</em> wholey disingenuous.

Eddlem\nMonday, 12 April 2010 17:20\nTweet\nFormer Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney won the Southern Republican Leadership Conference Presidential Poll April 10, defeating Rep. Ron Paul by a single vote, 438-437.\nBehind Romney's\u00a0victory is Romney's recent magic act: Campaigning against an Obama health care plan almost identical to the one he signed into law as governor of Massachusetts while at the same time\u00a0positioning himself as the \u201cconservative\u201d Republican presidential contender. With his risible \u201cconservative\u201d packaging, the Republican contender has truly become the greatest pretender.\n\u201cConservative\u201d Romneycare was made possible only by many new tax increases, including gigantic income tax increases (as much as $1,116 per family in Massachusetts). Mitt Romney acknowledged on a March 7 Fox News Sunday interview that \u201cWe do insist that people buy insurance or pay their own way. And if they \u2014 if they don't buy insurance, they'll find that their taxes are higher.\u201d Romneycare's individual tax penalties are even stiffer than those under Obamacare.\nYet Romney has stridently campaigned against Obamacare even while defending his own record on Romneycare. Romney's \u201cFree and Strong America PAC\u201d has been campaigning for a \u201cPrescription for Repeal,\u201d something Romney describes as a program \u201cwhich supports conservative candidates who will work to repeal the worst aspects of Obamacare and restore commonsense principles to healthcare.\u201d\nAfter Obamacare passed Congress, Romney wrote on the neo-conservative National Review blog : \u201cAmerica has just witnessed an unconscionable abuse of power. .... His health-care bill is unhealthy for America. It raises taxes, slashes the more private side of Medicare, installs price controls, and puts a new federal bureaucracy in charge of health care. It will create a new entitlement even as the ones we already have are bankrupt. For these reasons and more, the act should be repealed. That campaign begins today.\u201d\nThe problem is that the Romney-care Mitt Romney helped establish in Massachusetts has identical planks with Obamacare. The Massachusetts state government notes that, in addition to controlling insurance prices, Romneycare consists of:\nThe lynchpins of Massachusetts\u2019 health reform law (Chapter 58 of the Acts of 2006) are: (1) the individual mandate, which requires adults in the state to be insured if affordable insurance is available to them; (2) the merging of the individual and small group insurance markets; (3) the expansion of MassHealth, Massachusetts\u2019 Medicaid program (4) the creation of the Health Connector, which administers Commonwealth Care, a new subsidized health insurance program for low-income residents, and functions as an insurance exchange that serves as a purchasing vehicle for individuals and small businesses; and (5) a set of new requirements of employers, including the Fair Share Contribution requirement and the requirement that businesses establish and maintain Section 125 (Cafeteria) Plans.\nThus, it's not surprising that Newsweek columnist Daniel Gross opined of Obamacare March 29: \u201cSetting up this public-private partnership will require creating new infrastructure, managing a lot of moving parts, and dealing with powerful corporations and industry blocs. So who should President Obama appoint to be his health care reform implementation czar?... this sounds like a job for Mitt Romney.\u201d Gross explains :\n[T]here is the thing that disqualifies him from being the Republican nominee in 2012, which is the same thing that makes him best qualified for the job of health-care czar: He's basically already done it. In fact, he's the only executive who has done it. As countless commentators have noted (Alex Knepper from the right, Brad DeLong from the left, and David Frum from the spurned right), Obamacare largely is Romneycare. The concept of attaining near-universal health insurance in a defined geographic area using a combination of a mandate, subsidies, and cost-control efforts is essentially what Romney did in Massachusetts earlier this decade.\nThus far, Gross appears to be wrong only on one point. If the Southern Republican Leadership presidential poll is any indicator, Romney's actions toward government control of health care in Massachusetts have not \u201cdisqualified\u201d him from being the Republican nominee in 2012. GOP leaders there accepted him as a conservative even though he had shepherded his own version of Obamacare in as governor of Massachusetts.\nThe question is, can Romney keep the illusion going?\nTrackback (0)\n"}, {"score": 907.8248, "uuid": "93fc23d5-d979-53aa-a03d-456d5d856a89", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1201wb-80-02802", "target_hostname": "nvrdc.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://nvrdc.wordpress.com/tag/medicare/", "page_rank": 1.3996861e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "<em>Medicare</em> \u00ab Nevada Rural Democratic Caucus", "snippet": "\u201cThe <em>Medicare</em> Advantage program <em>is</em> stronger <em>than</em> ever,\u201d said Secretary Sebelius.

Ryan pretty much assumes that from now until eternity freezes over, apparently our government revenue will remain flat as a pancake at around 17-18% of GDP. \u00a0In the history of our nation, that just simply never has occurred. \u00a0For example, check out the curve from1970-2010. \u00a0Does that look flat to you? \u00a0 They claim that Social Security is going to consume most if not all of the Federal Government\u2019s revenues within the next few years. \u00a0UH \u2026 does that spending curve (in blue) look like it\u2019s rising at exponential rates consuming ever more of our government\u2019s revenue stream? \u00a0Or, does it look fairly stable \u00a0through 2080? \u00a0Even the CBO, in their analysis to Rep. Ryan clearly stated that \u201cSocial\u00a0Security would \u2026\u00a0be relatively stable as a share of GDP from 2030 forward.\u201d\nSimilarly, check out the \u201cMedicaid and other Health\u201d curve (in olive). \u00a0Does that curve look like it\u2019s rising at exponential rates and about to consume our entire revenue stream? \u00a0Nope, like the Social Security curve, it\u2019s relatively flat through 2080 as well. \u00a0Then there\u2019s the Medicare curve, which is rising. \u00a0I agree that costs are rising and that with the baby boomers approaching retirement age, and thus medicare age, more people will be applying for and being covered under that plan, but I\u2019m not sure Ryan\u2019s projection is even close to accurate. \u00a0Instead of converting the program to an ever-declining value, voucher-based program \u2014 a voucher that would be given directly to a for-profit insurance company that would find every possible excuse they can use to deny seniors access to effective treatments \u2014 we have to look for a better means to contain the escalating costs within the health care sector.\nHere are the key features of Ryan\u2019s proposed changes to Health Care, Medicare and Medicaid:\nMedicare\nStarting in 2022, the proposal would convert the current Medicare system to a system\u00a0of premium support payments and would increase the age of eligibility for Medicare:\nStarting in 2022, the age of eligibility for Medicare would increase by two months per year until it reached 67 in 2033.\nPeople who turn 65 in 2022 or later years and Disability Insurance beneficiaries who become eligible for Medicare in 2022 or later would not enroll in the current Medicare program but instead would be entitled to a premium support payment to\u00a0help them purchase private health insurance.\nBeneficiaries of the premium support payments would choose among competing private insurance plans operating in a newly established Medicare exchange. Those plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the Office of Personnel Management. Plans would have to issue insurance to all people eligible for Medicare who applied and would have to charge the same premiums for all enrollees of the same age. The premium support payments would go directly from the government to the plans that people selected.\nThe premium support payments would vary with the health status of the beneficiary. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would collect fees from plans with healthier enrollees, on average, and convey the proceeds to plans with less healthy enrollees, on average, with the goal of appropriately compensating plans for the health risks of their insured population. This risk\u00a0adjustment mechanism would be known as the risk review audit and would be budget-neutral.\nThe payment for 65-year-olds in 2022 is specified to be $8,000, on average, which is approximately the same dollar amount as projected net federal spending per capita for 65-year-olds in traditional Medicare (that is, the program\u2019s outlays minus receipts from the premiums enrollees pay for Part B and Part D, expressed on a per capita basis) under current law in that year. People who become eligible for Medicare in 2023 and subsequent years would receive a payment that was larger than $8,000 by an amount that reflected the increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) and the age of the enrollee. The premium support payments would increase in each year after initial eligibility by an amount that reflected both the increase in the CPI-U and the fact that enrollees in Medicare\u00a0tend to be less healthy and require more costly health care as they age. (For example, projected net federal spending per capita for all people age 65 and older in traditional Medicare would be about $15,000 in 2022, CBO estimates, in comparison with about $8,000 for 65-year-olds.\nThe premium support payments would also vary with the income of the beneficiary. People in the top 2 percent of the annual income distribution of the Medicare-eligible population would receive 30 percent of the premium support amount described above; people in the next 6 percent of the distribution would receive 50 percent of the amount described above; and people in the remaining\u00a092 % of the distribution would receive the full premium support amount\u00a0described above.\nBeginning in 2022, the federal government would establish a medical savings account (MSA) for certain beneficiaries with low income. (An MSA is an account that holds deposits that can be used for medical expenses.) Eligibility for MSA payments would be determined annually by the federal government on the basis of income relative to the federal poverty thresholds. The amount of the contribution in 2022 would be $7,800, and the annual amounts in subsequent years would grow with the CPI-U.\nEligibility for the traditional Medicare program would not change for people who are age 55 or older by the end of 2011 or for people who receive Medicare benefits through the Disability Insurance program prior to 2022. As a result, the average age and average costs of enrollees remaining in the traditional Medicare program would increase over time. However, enrollees\u2019 premiums under traditional Medicare would be adjusted to equal what they would be under current law\u2014a so-called hold harmless provision. People covered under traditional Medicare would, beginning in 2022, have the option of switching to the premium support system.\nMedicaid\nThe proposal would modify Medicaid as follows:\nStarting in 2013, the federal share of all Medicaid payments would be converted\u00a0into block grants to be allocated to the states. The total dollar amount of the block\u00a0grants would increase annually with population growth and with growth in the\u00a0CPI-U.\nStarting in 2022, Medicaid block grant payments would be reduced to exclude\u00a0projected spending for acute care services for elderly Medicaid beneficiaries. (emphasis added)\nStates would have additional flexibility in designing their program.\n2010 Health Care Legislation\nThe proposal would make several changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (or PPACA, Public Law 111-148) and the health care provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-152). In general, it would repeal the provisions of those laws that deal with insurance coverage, including:\nThe requirement that most legal U.S. residents obtain health insurance;\nThe establishment of health insurance exchanges and the provision of subsidies for\u00a0certain individuals and families who purchase coverage through the exchanges;\nThe expansion of Medicaid coverage to include most nonelderly people with income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level;\nThe penalties on certain employers if any of their workers obtain subsidized coverage through the exchanges; and\nThe tax credits for small employers that offer health insurance.\nThe proposal would also change some other provisions of PPACA and the Reconciliation Act:\nIt would repeal the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) program for long-term care insurance, as well as a number of mandatory grant programs including funds for so-called high-risk pools, reinsurance for early retirees, and prevention and public health activities.\nThe proposal would repeal the provisions that created the Independent Payment Advisory Board and that expanded subsidies for the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d in Part D (a range of spending in which many enrollees have to pay all of their drug costs, sometimes called the doughnut hole).\nMost of the other changes that PPACA and the Reconciliation Act made to the Medicare program would be retained.\nTort Reform\nSeveral changes would be made to laws governing medical malpractice, including putting in place limits on noneconomic and punitive damages.\nWhat happens to Health Care under President Obama\u2019s Budget Proposal:\nNow, contrast that with the $360B in Medicare \u00a0and Medicaid and other health program savings detailed in his budget (click the graphic at the left to view a larger copy). \u00a0The President does not turn Medicare into a voucher program nor does he propose to turn Medicaid into a Block Grant program that could all to easily be diverted for funding other pet projects, but it does adopt several Republican-backed ideas that would increase means testing for higher-income seniors and discourage overuse of care.\nUnder Obama\u2019s approach, for instance, higher-income seniors would pay more for doctors visits and prescription coverage beginning in 2017 and all new enrollees will pay a $25 deductible as part of their Part B premiums. But for the most part, the budget is similar to the administration\u2019s September 2011 deficit reduction plan and recoups the greatest savings from drug rebates and modernizing provider payments to achieve greater efficiency.\nRyan\u2019s Medicare savings don\u2019t kick in until 2022, so it\u2019s hard to make a direct comparison with Obama\u2019s proposal. But suffice it to say, Ryan would cut about 1.4 trillion from Medicaid alone and another $30 billion in net Medicare savings using last year\u2019s 10-year budget window, and those numbers rely on an analysis made by the CBO last April \u2026 it remains to be seen whether those numbers might be higher if that same analysis were to be conducted now.\nWhat About Tax Reform?\nRep. Ryan\u2019s budget outline makes it distinctly clear that the House Republicans\u2019 idea of \u201ctax reform\u201d has nothing to do with making the tax code fairer or raising revenues to contribute to deficit reduction. If Rep. Ryan was serious about tax reform, his budget would propose specific ways to broaden the tax base. Stunningly, however, the House budget fails to identify a single tax break or tax loophole in the entire Internal Revenue Code that he would close. Not one. \u00a0Instead, he proposes to identify those via \u201creconciliation\u201d in an open debate on the floor of the House. \u00a0Yeah right \u2026 and if you believe that\u2019s going to yield anything productive, I have some land \u2026.\nHere are four things you should know about Rep. Ryan\u2019s tax proposals:\nThey give a massive tax cut to the wealthy on top of the Bush tax cuts.\nThe \u201ctax reform\u201d plan fails to identify a single tax break or tax loophole to eliminate, making its rhetoric about \u201cbroadening the tax base\u201d ring hollow.\nThe House budget would inevitably result in a major middle-class tax increase, though it attempts to hide that fact\nEven with middle-class tax increases, the revenue side of their budget doesn\u2019t add up.\nThe utter lack of specificity on tax breaks and tax expenditures contrasts sharply with President Barack Obama\u2019s budget, which zeroes in on dozens of specific, unjustified tax breaks benefiting high-income households and special interests.\nEnds wasteful tax subsidies for oil and gas companies\nCloses \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole for hedge fund and private equity fund managers\nReforms major tax exclusions and deductions so that the wealthy do not receive a greater benefit than the middle class (Buffet rule)\nSunsets the Bush-era tax cuts for capital gains and dividends\nEliminates several specific tax subsidies for investment overseas to level the playing field for domestic job creation\nEliminates special write-off for corporate jets\nShuts down questionable \u201ccharitable deductions\u201d for golf courses\nShuts down certain legal and accounting strategies used by the wealthy to avoid estate taxes\nCloses many other unjustified loopholes for inventories, corporate-owned life insurance, the coal industry and others.\nAnd then there\u2019s the centerpiece of his \u201cPath\u201d \u2014 tax rates\nIn reading Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath,\u201d it was impossible to determine whether the taxes I would be expected to pay under his \u201cPath\u201d would be higher or lower than what I\u2019m currently paying. \u00a0He heralds that there would only be two rates \u2014 10% and 25% \u2014 but where\u2019s the breakpoint? \u00a0Are you paying 25% in taxes today? \u00a0Would you be paying 25% under Ryan\u2019s Path? \u00a0Oh, and then let\u2019s not forget that he\u2019s going to dump some of those egregious loopholes so he can \u201cbroaden the tax base.\u201d \u00a0Excuse me?\nWould there still be personal and dependent exemptions?\nWhat about the standard deduction or itemized deductions, like those for home mortgage interest?\nWill the child tax credit be eliminated?\nHow about the earned income tax credit?\nWill employee health benefits or Social Security benefits be taxed?\nWill it impose a new consumption tax, as Rep. Ryan has proposed in the past?\nWill Unemployment Compensation be taxed?\nWill the State & Local Tax exclusions be eliminated?\nWill the Sales Tax in lieu of State Tax deduction be eliminated?\nWithout knowing the answers to these questions, there\u2019s no way of knowing how you might be affected by Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d and whether you should vehemently oppose it with every breath of your body, or embrace it as a road to opportunity. \u00a0If you ask me or a large vocal majority that are beginning to speak out, Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d is nothing more than a massive shift in tax burden from the rich and multi-national corporations to the middle-class and the poor. \u00a0His previous \u201cRoadmap\u201d released in 2010, proposed to raise taxes on the bottom 95% of Americans while cutting them so dramatically for those at the top that the proposal actually lost huge amounts of revenue overall. \u00a0This \u201cPath\u201d merely doubles down on his previous attempts.\nWhat about Military Spending?\nThe bright side in Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d appears to be focused on expanding the military and cut-rate taxes for multinational corporations. \u00a0You might ask, just exactly how are those two related. \u00a0Well, military spending under Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d would NOT be cut and might even get a boost. \u00a0Thus, a whole range of multinational corporations would see a reduction in their max-tax rate to only 25% \u00a0(fat chance they\u2019ll ever pay that) \u00a0and they wouldn\u2019t see any reduction in US military protection of their interests both at home and abroad.\nThere are a massive number of US military bases strewn across the globe, not necessarily to assure OUR safety as Americans, but more to protect the interests of the multinational corporations. \u00a0Why else would we not have closed a large number of them after the Cold War ended during Reagan\u2019s term. \u00a0Click on the graphic at the left and you\u2019ll see how disproportionately we spend on our military and weapons of destruction. \u00a0Ryan\u00a0\u00a0has said that he wants to see the military spend more than the Obama administration has proposed and has reversed the sequestered cuts to the military in his \u201cPath.\u201d\nDefense spending has never fallen below 3 percent of GDP in the modern era, and Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign is calling for 4 percent of GDP to be spent on the military. It\u2019s also worth noting that in addition to what\u2019s detailed in the Dept of Defense budget, there\u2019s a full array of military spending related to nuclear weapons stashed in the Department of Energy\u2019s budget as well. \u00a0The upshot is that to meet the spending caps consistent with Ryan\u2019s views on the appropriate level of military spending would require us to pretty much have to completely dismantle the rest of the federal government.\nI\u2019m sorry, but if the multinational corporations think their tax rates are overly burdensome and want to pay less in taxes, then it\u2019s time for us to start closing a large number of overseas bases protecting their interests. \u00a0Let them fund their own protection out of their budgets instead. \u00a0Oh, and while we\u2019re at it \u2026 maybe we should charge them to use the roads that we pay for through our taxes, those taxes they don\u2019t want to pay.\nSo What Does It All Mean and What are the Differences between Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d and the President\u2019s Proposal?\nCBO estimates spending at 24.4 percent of GDP in 2022. Obama\u2019s budget would hold it to 22.8 percent. And Ryan\u2019s budget would keep it at 20.25 percent. \u00a0CBO projects public debt will rise to 94.2 percent of GDP by 2022. Obama\u2019s budget would hold it to 76.5 percent. Ryan\u2019s budget, according to CBO, would hold it to 70 percent. So Obama and Ryan\u2019s budgets are fairly close on debt over the next decade.\nDespite all of Ryan\u2019s pessimistic negativity in his \u201cPath for Prosperity\u201d the bottom-line differences in dollars spent and dollars received aren\u2019t all that great over the long run. \u00a0Yes, Ryan\u2019s numbers are lower\u00a0but, consider that the CBO analyzed Ryan\u2019s budget last April, and the CBO\u2019s economic outlook has worsened since then. Thus, if the CBO ran the numbers on his proposal today, the dimmer economic outlook they\u2019re projecting would likely lead to, at the least, more debt than he\u2019s acknowledging. \u00a0Plus, given that he\u2019s going to be cutting the crap out of \u201cgovernment\u201d \u2014 translated to \u201cfiring\u201d a whole lot of worthless government workers and bureaucrats (Romney would love that) \u2014 my guess would be that his projected \u201crevenue\u201d will be far less than anticipated, given that those folks he intends to fire aren\u2019t going to be paying all that much in taxes anytime soon.\nCome November, will you choose a future in which a middle class can thrive again in America like it did for 50 years after the New Deal, up until Ronald Reagan blew everything up? \u00a0If you really want the American Dream back \u2014 to be able to go to college without incurring grievous amounts of debt, to be able to have a good job and reliable healthcare, to live life knowing that an accident or illness won\u2019t wipe you out \u2014 then we need to work as hard as we can to kick these radical, reactionary Republicans out of government!\nResources:\n"}, {"score": 906.84827, "uuid": "2e85b405-60c4-5b89-8a83-29f07d1c00d1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1203wb-40-21141", "target_hostname": "nvrdc.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "https://nvrdc.wordpress.com/tag/medicare/", "page_rank": 1.4094033e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "<em>Medicare</em> \u00ab Nevada Rural Democratic Caucus", "snippet": "\u201cThe <em>Medicare</em> Advantage program <em>is</em> stronger <em>than</em> ever,\u201d said Secretary Sebelius.

People covered under traditional Medicare would, beginning in 2022, have the option of switching to the premium support system.\nMedicaid\nThe proposal would modify Medicaid as follows:\nStarting in 2013, the federal share of all Medicaid payments would be converted\u00a0into block grants to be allocated to the states. The total dollar amount of the block\u00a0grants would increase annually with population growth and with growth in the\u00a0CPI-U.\nStarting in 2022, Medicaid block grant payments would be reduced to exclude\u00a0projected spending for acute care services for elderly Medicaid beneficiaries. (emphasis added)\nStates would have additional flexibility in designing their program.\n2010 Health Care Legislation\nThe proposal would make several changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (or PPACA, Public Law 111-148) and the health care provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-152). In general, it would repeal the provisions of those laws that deal with insurance coverage, including:\nThe requirement that most legal U.S. residents obtain health insurance;\nThe establishment of health insurance exchanges and the provision of subsidies for\u00a0certain individuals and families who purchase coverage through the exchanges;\nThe expansion of Medicaid coverage to include most nonelderly people with income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level;\nThe penalties on certain employers if any of their workers obtain subsidized coverage through the exchanges; and\nThe tax credits for small employers that offer health insurance.\nThe proposal would also change some other provisions of PPACA and the Reconciliation Act:\nIt would repeal the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) program for long-term care insurance, as well as a number of mandatory grant programs including funds for so-called high-risk pools, reinsurance for early retirees, and prevention and public health activities.\nThe proposal would repeal the provisions that created the Independent Payment Advisory Board and that expanded subsidies for the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d in Part D (a range of spending in which many enrollees have to pay all of their drug costs, sometimes called the doughnut hole).\nMost of the other changes that PPACA and the Reconciliation Act made to the Medicare program would be retained.\nTort Reform\nSeveral changes would be made to laws governing medical malpractice, including putting in place limits on noneconomic and punitive damages.\nWhat happens to Health Care under President Obama\u2019s Budget Proposal:\nNow, contrast that with the $360B in Medicare \u00a0and Medicaid and other health program savings detailed in his budget (click the graphic at the left to view a larger copy). \u00a0The President does not turn Medicare into a voucher program nor does he propose to turn Medicaid into a Block Grant program that could all to easily be diverted for funding other pet projects, but it does adopt several Republican-backed ideas that would increase means testing for higher-income seniors and discourage overuse of care.\nUnder Obama\u2019s approach, for instance, higher-income seniors would pay more for doctors visits and prescription coverage beginning in 2017 and all new enrollees will pay a $25 deductible as part of their Part B premiums. But for the most part, the budget is similar to the administration\u2019s September 2011 deficit reduction plan and recoups the greatest savings from drug rebates and modernizing provider payments to achieve greater efficiency.\nRyan\u2019s Medicare savings don\u2019t kick in until 2022, so it\u2019s hard to make a direct comparison with Obama\u2019s proposal. But suffice it to say, Ryan would cut about 1.4 trillion from Medicaid alone and another $30 billion in net Medicare savings using last year\u2019s 10-year budget window, and those numbers rely on an analysis made by the CBO last April \u2026 it remains to be seen whether those numbers might be higher if that same analysis were to be conducted now.\nWhat About Tax Reform?\nRep. Ryan\u2019s budget outline makes it distinctly clear that the House Republicans\u2019 idea of \u201ctax reform\u201d has nothing to do with making the tax code fairer or raising revenues to contribute to deficit reduction. If Rep. Ryan was serious about tax reform, his budget would propose specific ways to broaden the tax base. Stunningly, however, the House budget fails to identify a single tax break or tax loophole in the entire Internal Revenue Code that he would close. Not one. \u00a0Instead, he proposes to identify those via \u201creconciliation\u201d in an open debate on the floor of the House. \u00a0Yeah right \u2026 and if you believe that\u2019s going to yield anything productive, I have some land \u2026.\nHere are four things you should know about Rep. Ryan\u2019s tax proposals:\nThey give a massive tax cut to the wealthy on top of the Bush tax cuts.\nThe \u201ctax reform\u201d plan fails to identify a single tax break or tax loophole to eliminate, making its rhetoric about \u201cbroadening the tax base\u201d ring hollow.\nThe House budget would inevitably result in a major middle-class tax increase, though it attempts to hide that fact\nEven with middle-class tax increases, the revenue side of their budget doesn\u2019t add up.\nThe utter lack of specificity on tax breaks and tax expenditures contrasts sharply with President Barack Obama\u2019s budget, which zeroes in on dozens of specific, unjustified tax breaks benefiting high-income households and special interests.\nEnds wasteful tax subsidies for oil and gas companies\nCloses \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole for hedge fund and private equity fund managers\nReforms major tax exclusions and deductions so that the wealthy do not receive a greater benefit than the middle class (Buffet rule)\nSunsets the Bush-era tax cuts for capital gains and dividends\nEliminates several specific tax subsidies for investment overseas to level the playing field for domestic job creation\nEliminates special write-off for corporate jets\nShuts down questionable \u201ccharitable deductions\u201d for golf courses\nShuts down certain legal and accounting strategies used by the wealthy to avoid estate taxes\nCloses many other unjustified loopholes for inventories, corporate-owned life insurance, the coal industry and others.\nAnd then there\u2019s the centerpiece of his \u201cPath\u201d \u2014 tax rates\nIn reading Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath,\u201d it was impossible to determine whether the taxes I would be expected to pay under his \u201cPath\u201d would be higher or lower than what I\u2019m currently paying. \u00a0He heralds that there would only be two rates \u2014 10% and 25% \u2014 but where\u2019s the breakpoint? \u00a0Are you paying 25% in taxes today? \u00a0Would you be paying 25% under Ryan\u2019s Path? \u00a0Oh, and then let\u2019s not forget that he\u2019s going to dump some of those egregious loopholes so he can \u201cbroaden the tax base.\u201d \u00a0Excuse me?\nWould there still be personal and dependent exemptions?\nWhat about the standard deduction or itemized deductions, like those for home mortgage interest?\nWill the child tax credit be eliminated?\nHow about the earned income tax credit?\nWill employee health benefits or Social Security benefits be taxed?\nWill it impose a new consumption tax, as Rep. Ryan has proposed in the past?\nWill Unemployment Compensation be taxed?\nWill the State & Local Tax exclusions be eliminated?\nWill the Sales Tax in lieu of State Tax deduction be eliminated?\nWithout knowing the answers to these questions, there\u2019s no way of knowing how you might be affected by Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d and whether you should vehemently oppose it with every breath of your body, or embrace it as a road to opportunity. \u00a0If you ask me or a large vocal majority that are beginning to speak out, Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d is nothing more than a massive shift in tax burden from the rich and multi-national corporations to the middle-class and the poor. \u00a0His previous \u201cRoadmap\u201d released in 2010, proposed to raise taxes on the bottom 95% of Americans while cutting them so dramatically for those at the top that the proposal actually lost huge amounts of revenue overall. \u00a0This \u201cPath\u201d merely doubles down on his previous attempts.\nWhat about Military Spending?\nThe bright side in Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d appears to be focused on expanding the military and cut-rate taxes for multinational corporations. \u00a0You might ask, just exactly how are those two related. \u00a0Well, military spending under Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d would NOT be cut and might even get a boost. \u00a0Thus, a whole range of multinational corporations would see a reduction in their max-tax rate to only 25% \u00a0(fat chance they\u2019ll ever pay that) \u00a0and they wouldn\u2019t see any reduction in US military protection of their interests both at home and abroad.\nThere are a massive number of US military bases strewn across the globe, not necessarily to assure OUR safety as Americans, but more to protect the interests of the multinational corporations. \u00a0Why else would we not have closed a large number of them after the Cold War ended during Reagan\u2019s term. \u00a0Click on the graphic at the left and you\u2019ll see how disproportionately we spend on our military and weapons of destruction. \u00a0Ryan\u00a0\u00a0has said that he wants to see the military spend more than the Obama administration has proposed and has reversed the sequestered cuts to the military in his \u201cPath.\u201d\nDefense spending has never fallen below 3 percent of GDP in the modern era, and Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign is calling for 4 percent of GDP to be spent on the military. It\u2019s also worth noting that in addition to what\u2019s detailed in the Dept of Defense budget, there\u2019s a full array of military spending related to nuclear weapons stashed in the Department of Energy\u2019s budget as well. \u00a0The upshot is that to meet the spending caps consistent with Ryan\u2019s views on the appropriate level of military spending would require us to pretty much have to completely dismantle the rest of the federal government.\nI\u2019m sorry, but if the multinational corporations think their tax rates are overly burdensome and want to pay less in taxes, then it\u2019s time for us to start closing a large number of overseas bases protecting their interests. \u00a0Let them fund their own protection out of their budgets instead. \u00a0Oh, and while we\u2019re at it \u2026 maybe we should charge them to use the roads that we pay for through our taxes, those taxes they don\u2019t want to pay.\nSo What Does It All Mean and What are the Differences between Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d and the President\u2019s Proposal?\nCBO estimates spending at 24.4 percent of GDP in 2022. Obama\u2019s budget would hold it to 22.8 percent. And Ryan\u2019s budget would keep it at 20.25 percent. \u00a0CBO projects public debt will rise to 94.2 percent of GDP by 2022. Obama\u2019s budget would hold it to 76.5 percent. Ryan\u2019s budget, according to CBO, would hold it to 70 percent. So Obama and Ryan\u2019s budgets are fairly close on debt over the next decade.\nDespite all of Ryan\u2019s pessimistic negativity in his \u201cPath for Prosperity\u201d the bottom-line differences in dollars spent and dollars received aren\u2019t all that great over the long run. \u00a0Yes, Ryan\u2019s numbers are lower\u00a0but, consider that the CBO analyzed Ryan\u2019s budget last April, and the CBO\u2019s economic outlook has worsened since then. Thus, if the CBO ran the numbers on his proposal today, the dimmer economic outlook they\u2019re projecting would likely lead to, at the least, more debt than he\u2019s acknowledging. \u00a0Plus, given that he\u2019s going to be cutting the crap out of \u201cgovernment\u201d \u2014 translated to \u201cfiring\u201d a whole lot of worthless government workers and bureaucrats (Romney would love that) \u2014 my guess would be that his projected \u201crevenue\u201d will be far less than anticipated, given that those folks he intends to fire aren\u2019t going to be paying all that much in taxes anytime soon.\nCome November, will you choose a future in which a middle class can thrive again in America like it did for 50 years after the New Deal, up until Ronald Reagan blew everything up? \u00a0If you really want the American Dream back \u2014 to be able to go to college without incurring grievous amounts of debt, to be able to have a good job and reliable healthcare, to live life knowing that an accident or illness won\u2019t wipe you out \u2014 then we need to work as hard as we can to kick these radical, reactionary Republicans out of government!\nResources:\n"}, {"score": 907.0975, "uuid": "3f2c3157-7c65-5b9f-95b9-2fcc8cc92d4a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1200tw-30-04374", "target_hostname": "thehealthcareblog.com", "target_uri": "http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2012/03/27/obamacare-and-the-end-of-nothing/comment-page-1/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "<em>ObamaCare</em> and the End of Nothing | The Health Care Blog", "snippet": "So why are the elderly doing over fifty times <em>better</em> <em>than</em> the young when they were only doing ten times <em>better</em> before?

Not only is this cliche not true, but it is exactly untrue. The only constant in health care is gnawing anxiety about change that never actually occurs.\nThe Obama Administration\u2019s health care reform plan \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we can all call it \u201cObamaCare\u201d now that the Administration finally owns the label it should have from the outset \u2013 is the motherlode of anxiety over change about to storm through the health care system. That is, unless you happen to cover your ears and block out all the partisan screaming, along with the political ideology dressed as legal arguments in the Supreme Court this week, and look at the actual plan and its numbers.\nYes, ObamaCare is expected to cram 30 million uninsured people into the current non-system. Complementary elements of the law make it illegal for health insurers to kick any of us out if we get too sick or stop paying our bills if we get too expensive. And if an insurer makes too much money in the process, it needs to refund a portion. Aside from these four economically intertwined health insurance market reforms, most everything else about ObamaCare is business as usual.\nTo wit: access to commercial health insurance for most of us will still run through the workplace; our employers will still, for better or worse, be charged with money-managing the system they love to hate, a messy, intrusive, difficult role foisted on them as an accident of history in the 1940s and enshrined in the tax code ever since. Health insurers will continue to operate half their book of business on a state-by-state basis, and the other half nationwide for self-insured employers, thus maximizing complexity, confusion and administrative cost for everyone involved.\nThere will be no new public health care plan for hard-pressed households \u2013 just a huge expansion of the nation\u2019s 50 broke and broken Medicaid plans, plus subsidized coverage for the luckier among the working poor to purchase (at the fountain-pen gunpoint of the IRS) a plan from commercial health insurers. Those insurers will continue to design and sell their plans based on the crazy-quilt of local standards and state benefit mandates, along with a few new federal mandates for preventive services \u2013 including things like the economically trivial but culturally explosive birth control pill.\nIf this is starting to feel like less than the \u201cgovernment takeover of health care\u201d shouted daily on the Republican campaign trail, and more like the status quo with some belated, populist insurance market regulatory reforms, then maybe we should look at the actual numbers.\nThe table below calculates the estimated coverage cost of ObamaCare as a share of projected national health spending from now until 2020.\nThe rest of ObamaCare \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the 906 pages of the actual law, not the 2,400 or 2,700 pages of draft bills, as erroneously reported and re-reported in the general media \u2013 is window-dressing.\u00c2\u00a0 Yes, it includes some big, expensive, controversial make-work projects for the health care technocracy, some of which is long overdue, some of which will be dangerous, but most of which will merely add to the current cacophony of conflicting medical evidence on everything from cholesterol management to hormone replacement therapy.\u00c2\u00a0 But after the Supreme Court is done pretending not to factor in the intensely political nature of their task this week and rules on the constitutionality of the mandate, life will go on precisely as it always has for what will be, by 2020, nearly a $5 trillion per year colossus, unchanged at its foundations.Oops! In the year 2020, ObamaCare is expected to cost $234 billion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 roughly 5.04% of all health spending, with an average cost running at 3.49% per year between now and then. The bottom line: in full flower, ObamaCare is an artfully diffused redistribution of health care funding costing barely 1/20th the size of the entire non-system it is supposedly taking over.\nAs with the bitterly debated Medicare drug benefit in 2004, ObamaCare is merely expanding the exact same things we have today for most Americans, to include all Americans, almost. The plan spreads the economic pain around the system fairly evenly, via taxes and fees that will show up in new equilibrium prices for insurance, drugs, and devices. And the economics of finally putting almost everyone into the system \u00e2\u0080\u0093 instead of waiting until they are on death\u2019s door, a.k.a., the door to the emergency room\u00c2\u00a0 \u2013 will offset some, most, all or none (depending on where you stand politically) of the upfront costs of getting them there. Anyone who says they know for sure how these systemic economic effects will play out is deluding himself and/or attempting to delude all of us, and is beating a political, not an economic drum.\nEntropy Rules\nHow the Medicare drug benefit has played out in the past eight years is the only precedent we have for what will happen if/when ObamaCare is implemented. When that program was debated in Congress, critics on the right screamed on cue about \u201cgovernment bureaucrats\u201d in our medicine cabinets, an entitlement that will bankrupt the country, etc., while critics on the left carped about the evils of capitalism, the program\u2019s outrageous use of money-making corporations to deliver products to people, etc.. Out of this political sausage-grinder came a classically American public health care program of government funding and corporate delivery, a \u201cmodernization\u201d truly consistent with the essence of the Medicare program.\nWith that modernization, the insurers, PBMs and specialty drug plans that administer the new drug benefit \u2013 and the drug companies that supply it \u2013 did not get everything they wanted; but they got enough to stay in business, make some money, and deliver long needed drug care to millions of people who previously could not afford it.\u00c2\u00a0 The Medicare drug benefit may be working no more perfectly than anything else in health care, but it is working just fine for millions of Americans who had too often been forced to choose between medicine and food, between certain death and slow starvation.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe that\u2019s why so few on the right or the left have brought it up in the debate: its embodiment of both political compromise and programmatic success constitute enough actual empirical evidence to sully anyone\u2019s ideological certitude.\nIndeed, the Medicare drug benefit may be a perfect trial run for ObamaCare.\u00c2\u00a0 It too wasn\u2019t really a health \u201creform\u201d plan \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you know, where the whole payment system changes radically so that teams of doctors, hospitals and other providers are paid to keep us healthy and minimize the effects of disease, rather than ignore us until we are sick and then maximize the use of interventions.\u00c2\u00a0 Such true reform would apparently require an Act of God, not just an Act of Congress. But if you are running a health care organization and worrying about the impact of ObamaCare, take note of what happened to those involved with the Medicare drug benefit: a few organizations failed miserably, some have profited mightily, and most have muddled through, figured out the rules of the new game, and are doing just fine.\nSuch will be the fate of hospitals and physician groups, as they scramble to build the \u201caccountable care organizations\u201d they should have built a decade and a half ago, when managed care was attempting the same sort of payment reforms included, barely, on the margins of ObamaCare.\u00c2\u00a0 Better to build these organizations to first-mover advantage for new, quality-driven contracting with insurers and employers \u2013 who want precisely this kind of true reform and who are not going anywhere anytime soon.\nIn the meanwhile, the US health care system will continue on its long march of three steps forward two steps back, bracing for that monster storm that never gets here.\u00c2\u00a0 A politically and legally embattled \u201chealth care reform\u201d plan that reforms almost nothing fundamental about health care will likely prove to be the troubled, underachieving child of American democracy\u2019s rapidly deteriorating marriage. A third of this country thinks health care is a basic human right and the government should finance the whole shebang; another third thinks health care is a market good that should be earned, with the government banished from sight; a middle third does not know what it thinks, only what it fears, based on the latest anecdote about Medicare fraud, insurance company abuse, government incompetence, or medical private profiteering in their local news cycle.\u00c2\u00a0 If nothing else, ObamaCare has proven to be a dark mirror on our most deeply embedded cultural conflicts, from the death panel freakshows to the neanderthal discussion on birth control.\nThe only constant in health care is indeed gnawing anxiety about change that never actually occurs. This is true most of the time, for most of the health care non-system, which is ruled less by either government or markets than it is by entropy. When real change does occur in health care, it does so one private business contract at a time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with six months\u2019 of meetings worth of notice \u2013 not via any grand re-engineering from Washington.\nJ.D.

Out of this political sausage-grinder came a classically American public health care program of government funding and corporate delivery, a \u201cmodernization\u201d truly consistent with the essence of the Medicare program.\nWith that modernization, the insurers, PBMs and specialty drug plans that administer the new drug benefit \u2013 and the drug companies that supply it \u2013 did not get everything they wanted; but they got enough to stay in business, make some money, and deliver long needed drug care to millions of people who previously could not afford it.\u00c2\u00a0 The Medicare drug benefit may be working no more perfectly than anything else in health care, but it is working just fine for millions of Americans who had too often been forced to choose between medicine and food, between certain death and slow starvation.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe that\u2019s why so few on the right or the left have brought it up in the debate: its embodiment of both political compromise and programmatic success constitute enough actual empirical evidence to sully anyone\u2019s ideological certitude.\nIndeed, the Medicare drug benefit may be a perfect trial run for ObamaCare.\u00c2\u00a0 It too wasn\u2019t really a health \u201creform\u201d plan \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you know, where the whole payment system changes radically so that teams of doctors, hospitals and other providers are paid to keep us healthy and minimize the effects of disease, rather than ignore us until we are sick and then maximize the use of interventions.\u00c2\u00a0 Such true reform would apparently require an Act of God, not just an Act of Congress. But if you are running a health care organization and worrying about the impact of ObamaCare, take note of what happened to those involved with the Medicare drug benefit: a few organizations failed miserably, some have profited mightily, and most have muddled through, figured out the rules of the new game, and are doing just fine.\nSuch will be the fate of hospitals and physician groups, as they scramble to build the \u201caccountable care organizations\u201d they should have built a decade and a half ago, when managed care was attempting the same sort of payment reforms included, barely, on the margins of ObamaCare.\u00c2\u00a0 Better to build these organizations to first-mover advantage for new, quality-driven contracting with insurers and employers \u2013 who want precisely this kind of true reform and who are not going anywhere anytime soon.\nIn the meanwhile, the US health care system will continue on its long march of three steps forward two steps back, bracing for that monster storm that never gets here.\u00c2\u00a0 A politically and legally embattled \u201chealth care reform\u201d plan that reforms almost nothing fundamental about health care will likely prove to be the troubled, underachieving child of American democracy\u2019s rapidly deteriorating marriage. A third of this country thinks health care is a basic human right and the government should finance the whole shebang; another third thinks health care is a market good that should be earned, with the government banished from sight; a middle third does not know what it thinks, only what it fears, based on the latest anecdote about Medicare fraud, insurance company abuse, government incompetence, or medical private profiteering in their local news cycle.\u00c2\u00a0 If nothing else, ObamaCare has proven to be a dark mirror on our most deeply embedded cultural conflicts, from the death panel freakshows to the neanderthal discussion on birth control.\nThe only constant in health care is indeed gnawing anxiety about change that never actually occurs. This is true most of the time, for most of the health care non-system, which is ruled less by either government or markets than it is by entropy. When real change does occur in health care, it does so one private business contract at a time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with six months\u2019 of meetings worth of notice \u2013 not via any grand re-engineering from Washington.\nJ.D.

Now that insurers can't discriminate based on preexisting conditions, it would be entirely possible for people to forgo insurance until, well, they develop a medical condition. In that world, the bulk of the people buying insurance on the exchanges are sick, and that makes the average premiums terrifically expensive.\"\nThat is one reason why President Obama and Speaker Pelosi both rejected a smaller health insurance bill after Sen. Scott Brown's victory and insisted on imposing an individual mandate on all Americans to purchase health care coverage, regardless of whether it is affordable, in order to guard against \"adverse selection.\"\nThis is the first time Congress has forced people to buy a product - a product some people have rejected previously because it was too expensive or simply not a good value for their money.\u00a0 CBO estimates that 15 million Americans will ignore the mandate and pay the penalty until they are sick.\nMassachusetts is the only state that requires people to buy health insurance.\u00a0 Rates in Massachusetts are some of the highest in the nation, and on average much higher than a state that does not require its residents to buy insurance.\u00a0 People are jumping in and out of the system, and adverse selection is driving premium increases.\u00a0 Recently, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts reported that 936 people bought insurance for three months or less in 2009 and dropped it, but they spent four times as much when compared to more traditional customers.\u00a0 To recoup its losses, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts has raised rates for all its customers.\nUnder ObamaCare, the Council for Affordable Health Insurance projects rates will increase 75 to 95 percent for the self-employed, small business workers, early retirees, and millions of other Americans who buy their own coverage.\u00a0\u00a0 Health care consumers are likely to act in their self-interest and pay the penalty rather than paying annual premiums for a product they can buy for a few months when they need treatment.\nTo try to help people with preexisting conditions, ObamaCare provides $5 billion for high risk pools before guaranteed issue for preexisting conditions and the individual mandate start in January 2014.\u00a0 However, Rick Foster, CMS's chief actuary, believes $5 billion isn't enough:\n\"We estimate that the creation of a national high-risk insurance pool would result in roughly 375,000 people gaining coverage in 2010, increasing national health spending by $4 billion. By 2011 and 2012 the initial $5 billion in Federal funding for this program would be exhausted, resulting in substantial premium increases to sustain the program; we anticipate that such increases would limit further participation.\"\nRather than commanding people to buy a product with benefits they may or may not want and cannot afford, the Republican plan (H.R. 4038) expands consumer choices through HSAs, allows people to buy a policy from any state, and allows associations to design their own health insurance plan.\u00a0 H.R. 4038 provides $25 billion (fully offset)\u00a0 to stabilize existing high risk pools, gives states an incentive to establish one, and provides security and affordable access for future enrollees without raising rates for all Americans.\u00a0 CBO estimated that the Republican plan would reduce the cost of health insurance by up to 10 percent in all markets, a better outcome for people with preexisting conditions.\nFor additional information, contact:\nThe House Republican Conference Policy Office\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 896.1441, "uuid": "a603226f-0324-50b1-94e5-6ef0c84f6f9a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1100tw-42-19989", "target_hostname": "social.patriotactionnetwork.com", "target_uri": "http://social.patriotactionnetwork.com/forum/topic/show?id=2600775:Topic:5623559&xgs=1&xg_source=msg_share_topic", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "<em>ObamaCare</em> and Death Panels....Yup Sure Enough!", "snippet": "<em>Is</em> this what all seniors are to expect from Obumbacare?

We need to reform health care. But this reform made things worse. The evidence and broken promises are all around us. It\u2019s time the President acknowledged it. And it\u2019s time the two parties came together and did something about it.\u2019\nWashington, D.C.\u2013 U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following remarks on the Senate floor Thursday regarding the need to repeal and replace the President\u2019s health care law:\n\u201cYesterday, I outlined a number of the broken promises we\u2019ve seen in connection with the Democrat health care law: from the promise of being able to keep the plan you have and like, to the promise of protecting Medicare, to the promise of lowering premiums, to the promise of lowering health care costs.\n\u201cDemocrats also said that taxes wouldn\u2019t go up, and existing conscience protections would be respected.\n\u201cLooking back, it seems like there wasn\u2019t anything Democrats, including the President, weren\u2019t willing to promise in order to get this bill across the finish line. But there\u2019s another category of disappointments too, and that\u2019s all the aspects of this bill Democrats\u2019 didn\u2019t even talk about before it passed.\n\u201cAs then-Speaker Pelosi famously said, \u2018We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.\u2019\nNOTICE THIS:\n\u201cAnd one of the things Americans found out about was something called IPAB \u2014 the Independent Payment Advisory Board \u2014 an unelected, unaccountable board of bureaucrats empowered by this law to make additional cuts to Medicare based on arbitrary cost-control targets. As a result of this new board, 15 bureaucrats would now have the power \u2014 without any accountability \u2014 to make changes to Medicare.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, there is no judicial or administrative review of the IPAB personnel or recommendations.\n\u201cIPAB isn\u2019t answerable to voters, and it can\u2019t be challenged in the courts.\n\u201cIts main role, as The Wall Street Journal editorial board put it, will be, \u2018the inevitable dirty work of denying care.\u2019\n\u201cIn an effort to control spending, IPAB will limit patient access to medical care.\n\u201cIt\u2019s that simple. And, frankly, it\u2019s unacceptable.\n\u201cRepublicans recognize the problem with Medicare spending and the need for reform.\n\u201cWe also recognize that IPAB isn\u2019t the answer.\n\u201cThis is just one more reason the Democrat health care bill needs to be repealed and replaced. And that\u2019s why even Democrats are co-sponsoring a bill to repeal it in the House, calling it \u2018a flawed policy that will risk beneficiary access to care.\u2019\n\u201cSo this isn\u2019t just a Republican issue. There\u2019s strong bipartisan opposition to it.\n\u201cLook: if the President himself doesn\u2019t even want to talk about this law anymore, and even Democrats are sponsoring repeal of parts of their own law in the House, it should be pretty obvious there\u2019s a fundamental problem here.\n\u201cWe need to reform health care. But this reform made things worse. The evidence and broken promises are all around us. It\u2019s time the President acknowledged it. And it\u2019s time the two parties came together and did something about it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to repeal the Democrat health care law and replace it with the kind of common-sense reforms Americans really want, reforms that actually lower costs, and which put health care back in the hands of individuals and their doctors, rather than bureaucrats in Washington.\u201d\nContact:\n"}, {"score": 891.5493, "uuid": "84c28ba1-f6c1-5815-8ef5-a1f54b9b0a64", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-31-19809", "target_hostname": "thehealthcareblog.com", "target_uri": "http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2012/04/02/is-there-a-republican-alternative-to-obamacare/", "page_rank": 1.3422479e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Is</em> There a Republican Alternative to <em>ObamaCare</em>? | The Health Care Blog", "snippet": "For many, the payroll tax bite <em>is</em> larger <em>than</em> the income tax.", "explanation": null, "document": "6 Responses\nBy John Goodman\n\u201c GOP to the Uninsured: (Feel Free to) Drop Dead .\u201d So reads the title Michael Millenson post at the Health Care Blog yesterday. It gets worse:\n[N]o Republican presidential candidate has ever presented a serious plan to cover all the uninsured \u2026 The difference between Democrats and this generation of Republicans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unfortunately including even the GOP Doctors Caucus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is not at its core a disagreement on what government can legitimately do to help create universal access to health care for the 50 million Americans without it, but whether the goal itself is worth pursuing.\nWas Millenson completely asleep (like Rip Van Winkle) during the last election? Does he not read my Wall Street Journal editorials ? Does he never visit my blog ? Or was this meant to be an April fool\u2019s column?\nJohn McCain\u2019s health plan was more radical and even more progressive than Obama Care. I\u2019ve never seen any serious health policy wonk deny that.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe Millenson doesn\u2019t live in a battle ground state. If he did, he would know that the Obama campaign spent more money attacking the McCain health plan during the election than has ever been spent for or against a public policy idea in the history of the republic. In fact, it is probably no exaggeration to say that Obama successfully turned the election into a referendum on the McCain health plan!\nThe McCain health plan is discussed at this blog here , here , here , here and here .\nAnd although Millenson singles out Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn as an especially egregious example of the Republican failure on health policy, the McCain vision actually was based on a bill , sponsored by Sen. Coburn and Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC), along with Reps. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Devin Nunes (R-CA), [hereinafter called the Coburn bill]. That bill, in turn, was based on an idea which Mark Pauly and I proposed in a Health Affairs article more than a decade ago. (Does Millenson not read Health Affairs?)\nWhat makes this Republican approach so radical is that it would replace all government tax and spending subsidies for the purchase of private health insurance with a fixed-sum tax credit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 essentially giving every American the same number of dollars to apply to their health insurance, regardless of where they obtain it.\nUnder the current system, federal state and local tax subsidies for private health insurance approach $300 billion a year. The distribution of these dollars is arbitrary, unfair and wasteful.\nHow much help a family gets from government depends on such factors as its tax bracket, the type of health plan the employer chooses, and state and local tax rates.\nThe subsidies are also regressive. According to the Lewin Group [Note: this link is from 2007 and reflects a factor of 4 times. Newer estimates by Lewin show that families earning $100,000+ get 6 times the tax subsidy and are based on a personal correspondence with John Sheils] families earning more than $100,000 a year get nearly six times as much tax relief as families earning $25,000. We give the most encouragement to buy health insurance to those people who least need encouragement and who probably would have purchased it anyway.\nIn addition, people can always lower their taxes by spending more on health insurance, and there is no limit to how bloated a health plan can be.\nOddly enough, we place special burdens on people who must purchase their own insurance. Essentially, they must pay taxes first and bring the insurance with what\u2019s left over.\nFor a worker facing a 15.3% (FICA) payroll tax, a 25% income tax rate and a 5% state income tax, having to buy health insurance with after-tax dollars essentially doubles its cost.\nSpecial burdens also are placed on part-time workers and the self-employed.\nConsider that 1-in-5 workers are part time. Employers usually do not offer these workers health insurance. And federal law makes it difficult for employers to give them a choice between wages and health insurance.\nThe self-employed are now able to deduct health insurance costs on their income tax returns. Unlike other workers, they get no relief from the 15.3% payroll tax. For many, the payroll tax bite is larger than the income tax.\nThese problems can be solved with an approach that treats everyone alike, regardless of income or job status.\nIt should start with these basic ideas:\nThe current system of tax and spending subsidies would be replaced by a tax credit of, say, $2,500 per person or $8,000 for a family of four for the purchase of health insurance.\nThe subsidy would be refundable; everyone gets it even if he does not owe any income taxes.\nFamilies can obtain the subsidy in the year in which the insurance is purchased and would not have to wait until April 15 the following year to get their credit.\nInsurance companies and other intermediaries would be able to help families obtain their credit and apply it directly to the health insurance premiums.\nAs a result, people who must purchase their own insurance (including part-time workers and the self-employed) would get just as much tax relief as people who obtain insurance through an employer.\nThe tax credit would subsidize the core insurance that everyone should have. It would not subsidize all the bells and whistles, as the current system does.\nSince employees and their employers would be paying for additional coverage with after-tax dollars, everyone would have an incentive to compare the value of extra health benefits to the value of other things money can buy.\nJohn C. Goodman, PhD, is president and CEO of the National Center for Policy Analysis. He is also the Kellye Wright Fellow in health care. His Health Policy Blog is considered among the top conservative health care blogs where health care problems are discussed by top health policy experts from all sides of the political spectrum.\nRelated Posts\n"}, {"score": 891.2729, "uuid": "7f37f8a1-db16-5bc0-8a76-b398d8bbf64c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1201wb-47-10219", "target_hostname": "nvrdc.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://nvrdc.wordpress.com/category/issues/medicare/", "page_rank": 1.3921042e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Medicare</em> \u00ab Nevada Rural Democratic Caucus", "snippet": "\u201cThe <em>Medicare</em> Advantage program <em>is</em> stronger <em>than</em> ever,\u201d said Secretary Sebelius.

Examples include contracts and purchase orders.\nAn outlay is a payment (usually a check drawn on the Treasury, or in cash) by the government in fulfillment of an obligation.\nWhile the budget bill ( H.Con.Res.112 ) doesn\u2019t specify the amount of obligations that have been undertaken, you\u2019ll clearly see a difference in new budget authority and anticipated outlays that will occur during each given budget year. \u00a0All figures below are shown in millions of dollars ( number X 1,000,000).\nNow, a budget is basically a statement of priorities. \u00a0I don\u2019t agree with the GOP\u2019s statement of priorities. \u00a0As you peruse the numbers, here are a couple of questions you should ask yourselves as to the GOP\u2019s priorities:\nNational Defense (050): \u00a0Do we really need to spend that much money on weapons, war, etc.? \u00a0Do you think it\u2019s time to close down some of those foreign bases? \u00a0A large number of those basest were necessary for \u201ccold war\u2019 security \u2026 but really \u2026 the cold war ended during Reagan\u2019s term.\nRep. Ryan claimed during introduction of version 2 of the \u201cPath to Prosperity\u201d that he was leaving \u00a0Social Security alone \u2026 yet check the numbers, he\u2019s cut back Social Security even further than he proposed under version 1.0. \u00a0Are his figures realistic given the number of baby boomers headed into retirement \u2026 or does it look to you like he\u2019s hiding a privatization scheme in his back pocket?\nRep. Ryan claimed that he needs to change the way we fund and deal with Medicare (turning it into voucher program). \u00a0Given that fact that he\u2019s cut Medicare spending even further from his V1.0 Path \u2026 what kind of value might those vouchers have? \u00a0And, how many Seniors will no longer be able to afford health care (or how many will be denied care by private insurance companies) before all is said and done?\nFunding for space and science has been increased. \u00a0Hmmm. \u00a0Is he hedging his bet just in case the Newster manages to pull of a major coup, win the Presidency and need the funding for his moon base?\nHe pretty much cut Energy to the bone in favor of locking us into nothing but oil strategy for the foreseeable future.\nHe cut education below what he proposed in Version 1.0 until 2017, when funding finally manages to eke past what he proposed in his Version 1.0 Path.\nHe increased funding for the Criminal Justice System \u2026 is he planning to incarcerate even more Americans?\nAnd lastly \u2026 he proposes to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Plan \u2026 yet in doing so, the federal government saves nothing in the process. \u00a0In fact, check out the rapidly escalating rise in health care costs (550). \u00a0Are you looking forward to insurance companies once again being in charge of your health, denying coverage, limiting lifetime coverage, utilizing claims of \u201cpre-existing conditions\u201d to deny coverage, charging women far more for insurance coverage than men, etc.?\nRep. Ryan has proposed nearly $3 Trillion dollars in cuts for the wealthy and multinational corporations. \u00a0Absent, however, from his \u201cPath\u201d was the means through which he would pay for those cuts. \u00a0Other than stealing working American\u2019s Social Security and Medicare, he has no means to pay for such unnecessary and outrageous cuts to government revenue. Pure and simple, his \u201cpath\u201d amounts to nothing more than \u2018theft.\u201d \u00a0And, if you scroll all the way to the bottom of this post, you will see that what Mr. Ryan has proposed will not get us any where near balancing our federal budget as the GOP is claiming this budget will get us closer to doing. \u00a0It does not and it will not. \u00a0What it will do is explode our national debt to $21,627,396,000,000 by 2022. \u00a0That\u2019s not a path to prosperity, that\u2019s a path to poverty and the destruction of our nation.\nPresident Obama Needs All of Us Right\u00a0Now!\nMarch 26, 2012 \u2014 NVRDC\nRepublicans can carp about Democrats rushing things through Congress, but Republicans are just as guilty if more more guilty of that tactic. \u00a0This week, Republicans in Congress are set to vote ( HCONRES112 ) to eliminate Medicare as you know it, and use the savings to pay for more special tax breaks for big corporations, political donors and Washington special interests. We must stand with President Obama to make sure right-wing Republicans don\u2019t get away with breaking this sacred promise to our seniors.\nAfter you watch the video, please join us in calling on all Americans who care about keeping our promises to future generations to contact their Member of Congress and tell them to keep their hands off our Medicare.

We must have a budget that is fair and protects Medicare, while creating jobs, strengthening small businesses, rebuilding the middle class and reducing the deficit.\nDavid Plouffe: \u201cWe did the\u00a0math\u201d\nMarch 22, 2012 \u2014 NVRDC\nThis morning, David Plouffe, Senior Advisor to President Obama, sent the message below to individuals on\u00a0the White House email list about the House Republican Budget. If you didn\u2019t get the email, be sure to sign up .\nEvery day, you and your family make choices about how you spend your money and what investments you make. Leaders in Congress do the same thing when they draw up their budgets for the country. And if you spend some time with their plans, you learn what they value, you see the type of country they want America to be.\nSo when Congressman Paul Ryan put out a new budget for the House Republicans this week, we spent some time with it. We took a careful look and did the math.\nHere\u2019s what we learned.\nRepublicans in Washington want to give millionaires and billionaires an average tax break of at least $150,000. They want to pay for those tax cuts by slashing programs that create jobs and protect our children, our seniors, and the veterans who have fought for the country. They want to end Medicare as we know it. And they want to undercut our economic strength by rolling back key investments in education, research, and our nation\u2019s roads and bridges.\nPresident Obama believes we need to live within our means and that\u2019s why he put forward a balanced plan that reduces the deficit by more than $4 trillion. But the plan put forward by the GOP fails that test of balance.\nTo show you what we mean, we\u2019ve put together an infographic that breaks out the kinds of priorities we\u2019d have to give up for the $150,000 tax break that Republicans want to give to\u00a0the nation\u2019s millionaires and billionaires.\nThe more people who share it, the more folks will understand what\u2019s at stake and how we can do better for the middle class.\nThanks,\nDavid Plouffe\nSenior Advisor to the President\nHope You Like Donut\u00a0Holes!\nMarch 21, 2012 \u2014 NVRDC\nI took the time yesterday to read (gag) through version 2 of Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s Path to Poverty strategy which would ask low-income and middle-class Americans to give up the American Dream altogether and bow down to the demands of the richest 1% and the multi-national corporations. \u00a0Nowhere in the plan is even a hint of \u201cjob creation\u201d and everywhere in the plan are cuts to vital social safety-net programs, education, infrastructure, and environmental programs. \u00a0And Ryan\u2019s coup de grace would be a complete repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the law Republicans fondly call Obamacare.\nRepresentative Ryan touts how his \u201cPath\u201d will promote \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d (just exactly what is that?) but fails to mention anywhere in his \u201cPath\u201d is how badly his budget plan will impact employment. \u00a0He\u2019s pretty much talking about gutting a huge chunk of government. \u00a0Now, that\u2019s not just some huge monolith sitting in Washington DC. \u00a0That\u2019s people\u2019s livelihoods. \u00a0Like Republican Governors across this nation, the Republican\u2019s in Congress intend to cut hundreds of thousands of jobs, drug test you when you show up to apply for benefits, and ensure that you perform public service work for any benefits you do qualify to receive. \u00a0Oh, and should you test positive, they\u2019ll just give you the boot. \u00a0Where\u2019s the \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d in all of that?\nRep. Ryan had a whole lot of pretty little charts inserted in his \u201cPath\u201d with which he hopes to scare Americans into submission. \u00a0The one at the left is a very good example, but it has some curious\u00a0anomalies. \u00a0 For one, Rep. Ryan pretty much assumes that from now until eternity freezes over, apparently our government revenue will remain flat as a pancake at around 17-18% of GDP. \u00a0In the history of our nation, that just simply never has occurred. \u00a0For example, check out the curve from1970-2010. \u00a0Does that look flat to you? \u00a0 They claim that Social Security is going to consume most if not all of the Federal Government\u2019s revenues within the next few years. \u00a0UH \u2026 does that spending curve (in blue) look like it\u2019s rising at exponential rates consuming ever more of our government\u2019s revenue stream? \u00a0Or, does it look fairly stable \u00a0through 2080? \u00a0Even the CBO, in their analysis to Rep. Ryan clearly stated that \u201cSocial\u00a0Security would \u2026\u00a0be relatively stable as a share of GDP from 2030 forward.\u201d\nSimilarly, check out the \u201cMedicaid and other Health\u201d curve (in olive). \u00a0Does that curve look like it\u2019s rising at exponential rates and about to consume our entire revenue stream? \u00a0Nope, like the Social Security curve, it\u2019s relatively flat through 2080 as well. \u00a0Then there\u2019s the Medicare curve, which is rising. \u00a0I agree that costs are rising and that with the baby boomers approaching retirement age, and thus medicare age, more people will be applying for and being covered under that plan, but I\u2019m not sure Ryan\u2019s projection is even close to accurate. \u00a0Instead of converting the program to an ever-declining value, voucher-based program \u2014 a voucher that would be given directly to a for-profit insurance company that would find every possible excuse they can use to deny seniors access to effective treatments \u2014 we have to look for a better means to contain the escalating costs within the health care sector.\nHere are the key features of Ryan\u2019s proposed changes to Health Care, Medicare and Medicaid:\nMedicare\nStarting in 2022, the proposal would convert the current Medicare system to a system\u00a0of premium support payments and would increase the age of eligibility for Medicare:\nStarting in 2022, the age of eligibility for Medicare would increase by two months per year until it reached 67 in 2033.\nPeople who turn 65 in 2022 or later years and Disability Insurance beneficiaries who become eligible for Medicare in 2022 or later would not enroll in the current Medicare program but instead would be entitled to a premium support payment to\u00a0help them purchase private health insurance.\nBeneficiaries of the premium support payments would choose among competing private insurance plans operating in a newly established Medicare exchange. Those plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the Office of Personnel Management. Plans would have to issue insurance to all people eligible for Medicare who applied and would have to charge the same premiums for all enrollees of the same age. The premium support payments would go directly from the government to the plans that people selected.\nThe premium support payments would vary with the health status of the beneficiary. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would collect fees from plans with healthier enrollees, on average, and convey the proceeds to plans with less healthy enrollees, on average, with the goal of appropriately compensating plans for the health risks of their insured population. This risk\u00a0adjustment mechanism would be known as the risk review audit and would be budget-neutral.\nThe payment for 65-year-olds in 2022 is specified to be $8,000, on average, which is approximately the same dollar amount as projected net federal spending per capita for 65-year-olds in traditional Medicare (that is, the program\u2019s outlays minus receipts from the premiums enrollees pay for Part B and Part D, expressed on a per capita basis) under current law in that year. People who become eligible for Medicare in 2023 and subsequent years would receive a payment that was larger than $8,000 by an amount that reflected the increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) and the age of the enrollee. The premium support payments would increase in each year after initial eligibility by an amount that reflected both the increase in the CPI-U and the fact that enrollees in Medicare\u00a0tend to be less healthy and require more costly health care as they age. (For example, projected net federal spending per capita for all people age 65 and older in traditional Medicare would be about $15,000 in 2022, CBO estimates, in comparison with about $8,000 for 65-year-olds.\nThe premium support payments would also vary with the income of the beneficiary. People in the top 2 percent of the annual income distribution of the Medicare-eligible population would receive 30 percent of the premium support amount described above; people in the next 6 percent of the distribution would receive 50 percent of the amount described above; and people in the remaining\u00a092 % of the distribution would receive the full premium support amount\u00a0described above.\nBeginning in 2022, the federal government would establish a medical savings account (MSA) for certain beneficiaries with low income. (An MSA is an account that holds deposits that can be used for medical expenses.) Eligibility for MSA payments would be determined annually by the federal government on the basis of income relative to the federal poverty thresholds. The amount of the contribution in 2022 would be $7,800, and the annual amounts in subsequent years would grow with the CPI-U.\nEligibility for the traditional Medicare program would not change for people who are age 55 or older by the end of 2011 or for people who receive Medicare benefits through the Disability Insurance program prior to 2022. As a result, the average age and average costs of enrollees remaining in the traditional Medicare program would increase over time. However, enrollees\u2019 premiums under traditional Medicare would be adjusted to equal what they would be under current law\u2014a so-called hold harmless provision. People covered under traditional Medicare would, beginning in 2022, have the option of switching to the premium support system.\nMedicaid\nThe proposal would modify Medicaid as follows:\nStarting in 2013, the federal share of all Medicaid payments would be converted\u00a0into block grants to be allocated to the states. The total dollar amount of the block\u00a0grants would increase annually with population growth and with growth in the\u00a0CPI-U.\nStarting in 2022, Medicaid block grant payments would be reduced to exclude\u00a0projected spending for acute care services for elderly Medicaid beneficiaries. (emphasis added)\nStates would have additional flexibility in designing their program.\n2010 Health Care Legislation\nThe proposal would make several changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (or PPACA, Public Law 111-148) and the health care provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-152). In general, it would repeal the provisions of those laws that deal with insurance coverage, including:\nThe requirement that most legal U.S. residents obtain health insurance;\nThe establishment of health insurance exchanges and the provision of subsidies for\u00a0certain individuals and families who purchase coverage through the exchanges;\nThe expansion of Medicaid coverage to include most nonelderly people with income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level;\nThe penalties on certain employers if any of their workers obtain subsidized coverage through the exchanges; and\nThe tax credits for small employers that offer health insurance.\nThe proposal would also change some other provisions of PPACA and the Reconciliation Act:\nIt would repeal the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) program for long-term care insurance, as well as a number of mandatory grant programs including funds for so-called high-risk pools, reinsurance for early retirees, and prevention and public health activities.\nThe proposal would repeal the provisions that created the Independent Payment Advisory Board and that expanded subsidies for the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d in Part D (a range of spending in which many enrollees have to pay all of their drug costs, sometimes called the doughnut hole).\nMost of the other changes that PPACA and the Reconciliation Act made to the Medicare program would be retained.\nTort Reform\nSeveral changes would be made to laws governing medical malpractice, including putting in place limits on noneconomic and punitive damages.\nWhat happens to Health Care under President Obama\u2019s Budget Proposal:\nNow, contrast that with the $360B in Medicare \u00a0and Medicaid and other health program savings detailed in his budget (click the graphic at the left to view a larger copy). \u00a0The President does not turn Medicare into a voucher program nor does he propose to turn Medicaid into a Block Grant program that could all to easily be diverted for funding other pet projects, but it does adopt several Republican-backed ideas that would increase means testing for higher-income seniors and discourage overuse of care.\nUnder Obama\u2019s approach, for instance, higher-income seniors would pay more for doctors visits and prescription coverage beginning in 2017 and all new enrollees will pay a $25 deductible as part of their Part B premiums. But for the most part, the budget is similar to the administration\u2019s September 2011 deficit reduction plan and recoups the greatest savings from drug rebates and modernizing provider payments to achieve greater efficiency.\nRyan\u2019s Medicare savings don\u2019t kick in until 2022, so it\u2019s hard to make a direct comparison with Obama\u2019s proposal. But suffice it to say, Ryan would cut about 1.4 trillion from Medicaid alone and another $30 billion in net Medicare savings using last year\u2019s 10-year budget window, and those numbers rely on an analysis made by the CBO last April \u2026 it remains to be seen whether those numbers might be higher if that same analysis were to be conducted now.\nWhat About Tax Reform?\nRep. Ryan\u2019s budget outline makes it distinctly clear that the House Republicans\u2019 idea of \u201ctax reform\u201d has nothing to do with making the tax code fairer or raising revenues to contribute to deficit reduction. If Rep. Ryan was serious about tax reform, his budget would propose specific ways to broaden the tax base. Stunningly, however, the House budget fails to identify a single tax break or tax loophole in the entire Internal Revenue Code that he would close. Not one. \u00a0Instead, he proposes to identify those via \u201creconciliation\u201d in an open debate on the floor of the House. \u00a0Yeah right \u2026 and if you believe that\u2019s going to yield anything productive, I have some land \u2026.\nHere are four things you should know about Rep. Ryan\u2019s tax proposals:\nThey give a massive tax cut to the wealthy on top of the Bush tax cuts.\nThe \u201ctax reform\u201d plan fails to identify a single tax break or tax loophole to eliminate, making its rhetoric about \u201cbroadening the tax base\u201d ring hollow.\nThe House budget would inevitably result in a major middle-class tax increase, though it attempts to hide that fact\nEven with middle-class tax increases, the revenue side of their budget doesn\u2019t add up.\nThe utter lack of specificity on tax breaks and tax expenditures contrasts sharply with President Barack Obama\u2019s budget, which zeroes in on dozens of specific, unjustified tax breaks benefiting high-income households and special interests.\nEnds wasteful tax subsidies for oil and gas companies\nCloses \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole for hedge fund and private equity fund managers\nReforms major tax exclusions and deductions so that the wealthy do not receive a greater benefit than the middle class (Buffet rule)\nSunsets the Bush-era tax cuts for capital gains and dividends\nEliminates several specific tax subsidies for investment overseas to level the playing field for domestic job creation\nEliminates special write-off for corporate jets\nShuts down questionable \u201ccharitable deductions\u201d for golf courses\nShuts down certain legal and accounting strategies used by the wealthy to avoid estate taxes\nCloses many other unjustified loopholes for inventories, corporate-owned life insurance, the coal industry and others.\nAnd then there\u2019s the centerpiece of his \u201cPath\u201d \u2014 tax rates\nIn reading Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath,\u201d it was impossible to determine whether the taxes I would be expected to pay under his \u201cPath\u201d would be higher or lower than what I\u2019m currently paying. \u00a0He heralds that there would only be two rates \u2014 10% and 25% \u2014 but where\u2019s the breakpoint? \u00a0Are you paying 25% in taxes today? \u00a0Would you be paying 25% under Ryan\u2019s Path? \u00a0Oh, and then let\u2019s not forget that he\u2019s going to dump some of those egregious loopholes so he can \u201cbroaden the tax base.\u201d \u00a0Excuse me?\nWould there still be personal and dependent exemptions?\nWhat about the standard deduction or itemized deductions, like those for home mortgage interest?\nWill the child tax credit be eliminated?\nHow about the earned income tax credit?\nWill employee health benefits or Social Security benefits be taxed?\nWill it impose a new consumption tax, as Rep. Ryan has proposed in the past?\nWill Unemployment Compensation be taxed?\nWill the State & Local Tax exclusions be eliminated?\nWill the Sales Tax in lieu of State Tax deduction be eliminated?\nWithout knowing the answers to these questions, there\u2019s no way of knowing how you might be affected by Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d and whether you should vehemently oppose it with every breath of your body, or embrace it as a road to opportunity. \u00a0If you ask me or a large vocal majority that are beginning to speak out, Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d is nothing more than a massive shift in tax burden from the rich and multi-national corporations to the middle-class and the poor. \u00a0His previous \u201cRoadmap\u201d released in 2010, proposed to raise taxes on the bottom 95% of Americans while cutting them so dramatically for those at the top that the proposal actually lost huge amounts of revenue overall. \u00a0This \u201cPath\u201d merely doubles down on his previous attempts.\nWhat about Military Spending?\nThe bright side in Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d appears to be focused on expanding the military and cut-rate taxes for multinational corporations. \u00a0You might ask, just exactly how are those two related. \u00a0Well, military spending under Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d would NOT be cut and might even get a boost. \u00a0Thus, a whole range of multinational corporations would see a reduction in their max-tax rate to only 25% \u00a0(fat chance they\u2019ll ever pay that) \u00a0and they wouldn\u2019t see any reduction in US military protection of their interests both at home and abroad.\nThere are a massive number of US military bases strewn across the globe, not necessarily to assure OUR safety as Americans, but more to protect the interests of the multinational corporations. \u00a0Why else would we not have closed a large number of them after the Cold War ended during Reagan\u2019s term. \u00a0Click on the graphic at the left and you\u2019ll see how disproportionately we spend on our military and weapons of destruction. \u00a0Ryan\u00a0\u00a0has said that he wants to see the military spend more than the Obama administration has proposed and has reversed the sequestered cuts to the military in his \u201cPath.\u201d\nDefense spending has never fallen below 3 percent of GDP in the modern era, and Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign is calling for 4 percent of GDP to be spent on the military. It\u2019s also worth noting that in addition to what\u2019s detailed in the Dept of Defense budget, there\u2019s a full array of military spending related to nuclear weapons stashed in the Department of Energy\u2019s budget as well. \u00a0The upshot is that to meet the spending caps consistent with Ryan\u2019s views on the appropriate level of military spending would require us to pretty much have to completely dismantle the rest of the federal government.\nI\u2019m sorry, but if the multinational corporations think their tax rates are overly burdensome and want to pay less in taxes, then it\u2019s time for us to start closing a large number of overseas bases protecting their interests. \u00a0Let them fund their own protection out of their budgets instead. \u00a0Oh, and while we\u2019re at it \u2026 maybe we should charge them to use the roads that we pay for through our taxes, those taxes they don\u2019t want to pay.\nSo What Does It All Mean and What are the Differences between Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d and the President\u2019s Proposal?\nCBO estimates spending at 24.4 percent of GDP in 2022. Obama\u2019s budget would hold it to 22.8 percent. And Ryan\u2019s budget would keep it at 20.25 percent. \u00a0CBO projects public debt will rise to 94.2 percent of GDP by 2022. Obama\u2019s budget would hold it to 76.5 percent. Ryan\u2019s budget, according to CBO, would hold it to 70 percent. So Obama and Ryan\u2019s budgets are fairly close on debt over the next decade.\nDespite all of Ryan\u2019s pessimistic negativity in his \u201cPath for Prosperity\u201d the bottom-line differences in dollars spent and dollars received aren\u2019t all that great over the long run. \u00a0Yes, Ryan\u2019s numbers are lower\u00a0but, consider that the CBO analyzed Ryan\u2019s budget last April, and the CBO\u2019s economic outlook has worsened since then. Thus, if the CBO ran the numbers on his proposal today, the dimmer economic outlook they\u2019re projecting would likely lead to, at the least, more debt than he\u2019s acknowledging. \u00a0Plus, given that he\u2019s going to be cutting the crap out of \u201cgovernment\u201d \u2014 translated to \u201cfiring\u201d a whole lot of worthless government workers and bureaucrats (Romney would love that) \u2014 my guess would be that his projected \u201crevenue\u201d will be far less than anticipated, given that those folks he intends to fire aren\u2019t going to be paying all that much in taxes anytime soon.\nCome November, will you choose a future in which a middle class can thrive again in America like it did for 50 years after the New Deal, up until Ronald Reagan blew everything up? \u00a0If you really want the American Dream back \u2014 to be able to go to college without incurring grievous amounts of debt, to be able to have a good job and reliable healthcare, to live life knowing that an accident or illness won\u2019t wipe you out \u2014 then we need to work as hard as we can to kick these radical, reactionary Republicans out of government!\nResources:\n"}, {"score": 874.7364, "uuid": "6c33e5c3-dc77-508b-9368-c2585019baf2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1202wb-81-13728", "target_hostname": "nvrdc.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "https://nvrdc.wordpress.com/category/issues/medicare/", "page_rank": 1.4664806e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "<em>Medicare</em> \u00ab Nevada Rural Democratic Caucus", "snippet": "far more for the same health insurance policy <em>than</em> <em>any</em> man would have to pay.

Examples include contracts and purchase orders.\nAn outlay is a payment (usually a check drawn on the Treasury, or in cash) by the government in fulfillment of an obligation.\nWhile the budget bill ( H.Con.Res.112 ) doesn\u2019t specify the amount of obligations that have been undertaken, you\u2019ll clearly see a difference in new budget authority and anticipated outlays that will occur during each given budget year. \u00a0All figures below are shown in millions of dollars ( number X 1,000,000).\nNow, a budget is basically a statement of priorities. \u00a0I don\u2019t agree with the GOP\u2019s statement of priorities. \u00a0As you peruse the numbers, here are a couple of questions you should ask yourselves as to the GOP\u2019s priorities:\nNational Defense (050): \u00a0Do we really need to spend that much money on weapons, war, etc.? \u00a0Do you think it\u2019s time to close down some of those foreign bases? \u00a0A large number of those basest were necessary for \u201ccold war\u2019 security \u2026 but really \u2026 the cold war ended during Reagan\u2019s term.\nRep. Ryan claimed during introduction of version 2 of the \u201cPath to Prosperity\u201d that he was leaving \u00a0Social Security alone \u2026 yet check the numbers, he\u2019s cut back Social Security even further than he proposed under version 1.0. \u00a0Are his figures realistic given the number of baby boomers headed into retirement \u2026 or does it look to you like he\u2019s hiding a privatization scheme in his back pocket?\nRep. Ryan claimed that he needs to change the way we fund and deal with Medicare (turning it into voucher program). \u00a0Given that fact that he\u2019s cut Medicare spending even further from his V1.0 Path \u2026 what kind of value might those vouchers have? \u00a0And, how many Seniors will no longer be able to afford health care (or how many will be denied care by private insurance companies) before all is said and done?\nFunding for space and science has been increased. \u00a0Hmmm. \u00a0Is he hedging his bet just in case the Newster manages to pull of a major coup, win the Presidency and need the funding for his moon base?\nHe pretty much cut Energy to the bone in favor of locking us into nothing but oil strategy for the foreseeable future.\nHe cut education below what he proposed in Version 1.0 until 2017, when funding finally manages to eke past what he proposed in his Version 1.0 Path.\nHe increased funding for the Criminal Justice System \u2026 is he planning to incarcerate even more Americans?\nAnd lastly \u2026 he proposes to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Plan \u2026 yet in doing so, the federal government saves nothing in the process. \u00a0In fact, check out the rapidly escalating rise in health care costs (550). \u00a0Are you looking forward to insurance companies once again being in charge of your health, denying coverage, limiting lifetime coverage, utilizing claims of \u201cpre-existing conditions\u201d to deny coverage, charging women far more for insurance coverage than men, etc.?\nRep. Ryan has proposed nearly $3 Trillion dollars in cuts for the wealthy and multinational corporations. \u00a0Absent, however, from his \u201cPath\u201d was the means through which he would pay for those cuts. \u00a0Other than stealing working American\u2019s Social Security and Medicare, he has no means to pay for such unnecessary and outrageous cuts to government revenue. Pure and simple, his \u201cpath\u201d amounts to nothing more than \u2018theft.\u201d \u00a0And, if you scroll all the way to the bottom of this post, you will see that what Mr. Ryan has proposed will not get us any where near balancing our federal budget as the GOP is claiming this budget will get us closer to doing. \u00a0It does not and it will not. \u00a0What it will do is explode our national debt to $21,627,396,000,000 by 2022. \u00a0That\u2019s not a path to prosperity, that\u2019s a path to poverty and the destruction of our nation.\nPresident Obama Needs All of Us Right\u00a0Now!\nMarch 26, 2012 \u2014 NVRDC\nRepublicans can carp about Democrats rushing things through Congress, but Republicans are just as guilty if more more guilty of that tactic. \u00a0This week, Republicans in Congress are set to vote ( HCONRES112 ) to eliminate Medicare as you know it, and use the savings to pay for more special tax breaks for big corporations, political donors and Washington special interests. We must stand with President Obama to make sure right-wing Republicans don\u2019t get away with breaking this sacred promise to our seniors.\nAfter you watch the video, please join us in calling on all Americans who care about keeping our promises to future generations to contact their Member of Congress and tell them to keep their hands off our Medicare.

We must have a budget that is fair and protects Medicare, while creating jobs, strengthening small businesses, rebuilding the middle class and reducing the deficit.\nDavid Plouffe: \u201cWe did the\u00a0math\u201d\nMarch 22, 2012 \u2014 NVRDC\nThis morning, David Plouffe, Senior Advisor to President Obama, sent the message below to individuals on\u00a0the White House email list about the House Republican Budget. If you didn\u2019t get the email, be sure to sign up .\nEvery day, you and your family make choices about how you spend your money and what investments you make. Leaders in Congress do the same thing when they draw up their budgets for the country. And if you spend some time with their plans, you learn what they value, you see the type of country they want America to be.\nSo when Congressman Paul Ryan put out a new budget for the House Republicans this week, we spent some time with it. We took a careful look and did the math.\nHere\u2019s what we learned.\nRepublicans in Washington want to give millionaires and billionaires an average tax break of at least $150,000. They want to pay for those tax cuts by slashing programs that create jobs and protect our children, our seniors, and the veterans who have fought for the country. They want to end Medicare as we know it. And they want to undercut our economic strength by rolling back key investments in education, research, and our nation\u2019s roads and bridges.\nPresident Obama believes we need to live within our means and that\u2019s why he put forward a balanced plan that reduces the deficit by more than $4 trillion. But the plan put forward by the GOP fails that test of balance.\nTo show you what we mean, we\u2019ve put together an infographic that breaks out the kinds of priorities we\u2019d have to give up for the $150,000 tax break that Republicans want to give to\u00a0the nation\u2019s millionaires and billionaires.\nThe more people who share it, the more folks will understand what\u2019s at stake and how we can do better for the middle class.\nThanks,\nDavid Plouffe\nSenior Advisor to the President\nHope You Like Donut\u00a0Holes!\nMarch 21, 2012 \u2014 NVRDC\nI took the time yesterday to read (gag) through version 2 of Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s Path to Poverty strategy which would ask low-income and middle-class Americans to give up the American Dream altogether and bow down to the demands of the richest 1% and the multi-national corporations. \u00a0Nowhere in the plan is even a hint of \u201cjob creation\u201d and everywhere in the plan are cuts to vital social safety-net programs, education, infrastructure, and environmental programs. \u00a0And Ryan\u2019s coup de grace would be a complete repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the law Republicans fondly call Obamacare.\nRepresentative Ryan touts how his \u201cPath\u201d will promote \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d (just exactly what is that?) but fails to mention anywhere in his \u201cPath\u201d is how badly his budget plan will impact employment. \u00a0He\u2019s pretty much talking about gutting a huge chunk of government. \u00a0Now, that\u2019s not just some huge monolith sitting in Washington DC. \u00a0That\u2019s people\u2019s livelihoods. \u00a0Like Republican Governors across this nation, the Republican\u2019s in Congress intend to cut hundreds of thousands of jobs, drug test you when you show up to apply for benefits, and ensure that you perform public service work for any benefits you do qualify to receive. \u00a0Oh, and should you test positive, they\u2019ll just give you the boot. \u00a0Where\u2019s the \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d in all of that?\nRep. Ryan had a whole lot of pretty little charts inserted in his \u201cPath\u201d with which he hopes to scare Americans into submission. \u00a0The one at the left is a very good example, but it has some curious\u00a0anomalies. \u00a0 For one, Rep. Ryan pretty much assumes that from now until eternity freezes over, apparently our government revenue will remain flat as a pancake at around 17-18% of GDP. \u00a0In the history of our nation, that just simply never has occurred. \u00a0For example, check out the curve from1970-2010. \u00a0Does that look flat to you? \u00a0 They claim that Social Security is going to consume most if not all of the Federal Government\u2019s revenues within the next few years. \u00a0UH \u2026 does that spending curve (in blue) look like it\u2019s rising at exponential rates consuming ever more of our government\u2019s revenue stream? \u00a0Or, does it look fairly stable \u00a0through 2080? \u00a0Even the CBO, in their analysis to Rep. Ryan clearly stated that \u201cSocial\u00a0Security would \u2026\u00a0be relatively stable as a share of GDP from 2030 forward.\u201d\nSimilarly, check out the \u201cMedicaid and other Health\u201d curve (in olive). \u00a0Does that curve look like it\u2019s rising at exponential rates and about to consume our entire revenue stream? \u00a0Nope, like the Social Security curve, it\u2019s relatively flat through 2080 as well. \u00a0Then there\u2019s the Medicare curve, which is rising. \u00a0I agree that costs are rising and that with the baby boomers approaching retirement age, and thus medicare age, more people will be applying for and being covered under that plan, but I\u2019m not sure Ryan\u2019s projection is even close to accurate. \u00a0Instead of converting the program to an ever-declining value, voucher-based program \u2014 a voucher that would be given directly to a for-profit insurance company that would find every possible excuse they can use to deny seniors access to effective treatments \u2014 we have to look for a better means to contain the escalating costs within the health care sector.\nHere are the key features of Ryan\u2019s proposed changes to Health Care, Medicare and Medicaid:\nMedicare\nStarting in 2022, the proposal would convert the current Medicare system to a system\u00a0of premium support payments and would increase the age of eligibility for Medicare:\nStarting in 2022, the age of eligibility for Medicare would increase by two months per year until it reached 67 in 2033.\nPeople who turn 65 in 2022 or later years and Disability Insurance beneficiaries who become eligible for Medicare in 2022 or later would not enroll in the current Medicare program but instead would be entitled to a premium support payment to\u00a0help them purchase private health insurance.\nBeneficiaries of the premium support payments would choose among competing private insurance plans operating in a newly established Medicare exchange. Those plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the Office of Personnel Management. Plans would have to issue insurance to all people eligible for Medicare who applied and would have to charge the same premiums for all enrollees of the same age. The premium support payments would go directly from the government to the plans that people selected.\nThe premium support payments would vary with the health status of the beneficiary. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would collect fees from plans with healthier enrollees, on average, and convey the proceeds to plans with less healthy enrollees, on average, with the goal of appropriately compensating plans for the health risks of their insured population. This risk\u00a0adjustment mechanism would be known as the risk review audit and would be budget-neutral.\nThe payment for 65-year-olds in 2022 is specified to be $8,000, on average, which is approximately the same dollar amount as projected net federal spending per capita for 65-year-olds in traditional Medicare (that is, the program\u2019s outlays minus receipts from the premiums enrollees pay for Part B and Part D, expressed on a per capita basis) under current law in that year. People who become eligible for Medicare in 2023 and subsequent years would receive a payment that was larger than $8,000 by an amount that reflected the increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) and the age of the enrollee. The premium support payments would increase in each year after initial eligibility by an amount that reflected both the increase in the CPI-U and the fact that enrollees in Medicare\u00a0tend to be less healthy and require more costly health care as they age. (For example, projected net federal spending per capita for all people age 65 and older in traditional Medicare would be about $15,000 in 2022, CBO estimates, in comparison with about $8,000 for 65-year-olds.\nThe premium support payments would also vary with the income of the beneficiary. People in the top 2 percent of the annual income distribution of the Medicare-eligible population would receive 30 percent of the premium support amount described above; people in the next 6 percent of the distribution would receive 50 percent of the amount described above; and people in the remaining\u00a092 % of the distribution would receive the full premium support amount\u00a0described above.\nBeginning in 2022, the federal government would establish a medical savings account (MSA) for certain beneficiaries with low income. (An MSA is an account that holds deposits that can be used for medical expenses.) Eligibility for MSA payments would be determined annually by the federal government on the basis of income relative to the federal poverty thresholds. The amount of the contribution in 2022 would be $7,800, and the annual amounts in subsequent years would grow with the CPI-U.\nEligibility for the traditional Medicare program would not change for people who are age 55 or older by the end of 2011 or for people who receive Medicare benefits through the Disability Insurance program prior to 2022. As a result, the average age and average costs of enrollees remaining in the traditional Medicare program would increase over time. However, enrollees\u2019 premiums under traditional Medicare would be adjusted to equal what they would be under current law\u2014a so-called hold harmless provision. People covered under traditional Medicare would, beginning in 2022, have the option of switching to the premium support system.\nMedicaid\nThe proposal would modify Medicaid as follows:\nStarting in 2013, the federal share of all Medicaid payments would be converted\u00a0into block grants to be allocated to the states. The total dollar amount of the block\u00a0grants would increase annually with population growth and with growth in the\u00a0CPI-U.\nStarting in 2022, Medicaid block grant payments would be reduced to exclude\u00a0projected spending for acute care services for elderly Medicaid beneficiaries. (emphasis added)\nStates would have additional flexibility in designing their program.\n2010 Health Care Legislation\nThe proposal would make several changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (or PPACA, Public Law 111-148) and the health care provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-152). In general, it would repeal the provisions of those laws that deal with insurance coverage, including:\nThe requirement that most legal U.S. residents obtain health insurance;\nThe establishment of health insurance exchanges and the provision of subsidies for\u00a0certain individuals and families who purchase coverage through the exchanges;\nThe expansion of Medicaid coverage to include most nonelderly people with income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level;\nThe penalties on certain employers if any of their workers obtain subsidized coverage through the exchanges; and\nThe tax credits for small employers that offer health insurance.\nThe proposal would also change some other provisions of PPACA and the Reconciliation Act:\nIt would repeal the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) program for long-term care insurance, as well as a number of mandatory grant programs including funds for so-called high-risk pools, reinsurance for early retirees, and prevention and public health activities.\nThe proposal would repeal the provisions that created the Independent Payment Advisory Board and that expanded subsidies for the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d in Part D (a range of spending in which many enrollees have to pay all of their drug costs, sometimes called the doughnut hole).\nMost of the other changes that PPACA and the Reconciliation Act made to the Medicare program would be retained.\nTort Reform\nSeveral changes would be made to laws governing medical malpractice, including putting in place limits on noneconomic and punitive damages.\nWhat happens to Health Care under President Obama\u2019s Budget Proposal:\nNow, contrast that with the $360B in Medicare \u00a0and Medicaid and other health program savings detailed in his budget (click the graphic at the left to view a larger copy). \u00a0The President does not turn Medicare into a voucher program nor does he propose to turn Medicaid into a Block Grant program that could all to easily be diverted for funding other pet projects, but it does adopt several Republican-backed ideas that would increase means testing for higher-income seniors and discourage overuse of care.\nUnder Obama\u2019s approach, for instance, higher-income seniors would pay more for doctors visits and prescription coverage beginning in 2017 and all new enrollees will pay a $25 deductible as part of their Part B premiums. But for the most part, the budget is similar to the administration\u2019s September 2011 deficit reduction plan and recoups the greatest savings from drug rebates and modernizing provider payments to achieve greater efficiency.\nRyan\u2019s Medicare savings don\u2019t kick in until 2022, so it\u2019s hard to make a direct comparison with Obama\u2019s proposal. But suffice it to say, Ryan would cut about 1.4 trillion from Medicaid alone and another $30 billion in net Medicare savings using last year\u2019s 10-year budget window, and those numbers rely on an analysis made by the CBO last April \u2026 it remains to be seen whether those numbers might be higher if that same analysis were to be conducted now.\nWhat About Tax Reform?\nRep. Ryan\u2019s budget outline makes it distinctly clear that the House Republicans\u2019 idea of \u201ctax reform\u201d has nothing to do with making the tax code fairer or raising revenues to contribute to deficit reduction. If Rep. Ryan was serious about tax reform, his budget would propose specific ways to broaden the tax base. Stunningly, however, the House budget fails to identify a single tax break or tax loophole in the entire Internal Revenue Code that he would close. Not one. \u00a0Instead, he proposes to identify those via \u201creconciliation\u201d in an open debate on the floor of the House. \u00a0Yeah right \u2026 and if you believe that\u2019s going to yield anything productive, I have some land \u2026.\nHere are four things you should know about Rep. Ryan\u2019s tax proposals:\nThey give a massive tax cut to the wealthy on top of the Bush tax cuts.\nThe \u201ctax reform\u201d plan fails to identify a single tax break or tax loophole to eliminate, making its rhetoric about \u201cbroadening the tax base\u201d ring hollow.\nThe House budget would inevitably result in a major middle-class tax increase, though it attempts to hide that fact\nEven with middle-class tax increases, the revenue side of their budget doesn\u2019t add up.\nThe utter lack of specificity on tax breaks and tax expenditures contrasts sharply with President Barack Obama\u2019s budget, which zeroes in on dozens of specific, unjustified tax breaks benefiting high-income households and special interests.\nEnds wasteful tax subsidies for oil and gas companies\nCloses \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole for hedge fund and private equity fund managers\nReforms major tax exclusions and deductions so that the wealthy do not receive a greater benefit than the middle class (Buffet rule)\nSunsets the Bush-era tax cuts for capital gains and dividends\nEliminates several specific tax subsidies for investment overseas to level the playing field for domestic job creation\nEliminates special write-off for corporate jets\nShuts down questionable \u201ccharitable deductions\u201d for golf courses\nShuts down certain legal and accounting strategies used by the wealthy to avoid estate taxes\nCloses many other unjustified loopholes for inventories, corporate-owned life insurance, the coal industry and others.\nAnd then there\u2019s the centerpiece of his \u201cPath\u201d \u2014 tax rates\nIn reading Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath,\u201d it was impossible to determine whether the taxes I would be expected to pay under his \u201cPath\u201d would be higher or lower than what I\u2019m currently paying. \u00a0He heralds that there would only be two rates \u2014 10% and 25% \u2014 but where\u2019s the breakpoint? \u00a0Are you paying 25% in taxes today? \u00a0Would you be paying 25% under Ryan\u2019s Path? \u00a0Oh, and then let\u2019s not forget that he\u2019s going to dump some of those egregious loopholes so he can \u201cbroaden the tax base.\u201d \u00a0Excuse me?\nWould there still be personal and dependent exemptions?\nWhat about the standard deduction or itemized deductions, like those for home mortgage interest?\nWill the child tax credit be eliminated?\nHow about the earned income tax credit?\nWill employee health benefits or Social Security benefits be taxed?\nWill it impose a new consumption tax, as Rep. Ryan has proposed in the past?\nWill Unemployment Compensation be taxed?\nWill the State & Local Tax exclusions be eliminated?\nWill the Sales Tax in lieu of State Tax deduction be eliminated?\nWithout knowing the answers to these questions, there\u2019s no way of knowing how you might be affected by Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d and whether you should vehemently oppose it with every breath of your body, or embrace it as a road to opportunity. \u00a0If you ask me or a large vocal majority that are beginning to speak out, Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d is nothing more than a massive shift in tax burden from the rich and multi-national corporations to the middle-class and the poor. \u00a0His previous \u201cRoadmap\u201d released in 2010, proposed to raise taxes on the bottom 95% of Americans while cutting them so dramatically for those at the top that the proposal actually lost huge amounts of revenue overall. \u00a0This \u201cPath\u201d merely doubles down on his previous attempts.\nWhat about Military Spending?\nThe bright side in Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d appears to be focused on expanding the military and cut-rate taxes for multinational corporations. \u00a0You might ask, just exactly how are those two related. \u00a0Well, military spending under Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d would NOT be cut and might even get a boost. \u00a0Thus, a whole range of multinational corporations would see a reduction in their max-tax rate to only 25% \u00a0(fat chance they\u2019ll ever pay that) \u00a0and they wouldn\u2019t see any reduction in US military protection of their interests both at home and abroad.\nThere are a massive number of US military bases strewn across the globe, not necessarily to assure OUR safety as Americans, but more to protect the interests of the multinational corporations. \u00a0Why else would we not have closed a large number of them after the Cold War ended during Reagan\u2019s term. \u00a0Click on the graphic at the left and you\u2019ll see how disproportionately we spend on our military and weapons of destruction. \u00a0Ryan\u00a0\u00a0has said that he wants to see the military spend more than the Obama administration has proposed and has reversed the sequestered cuts to the military in his \u201cPath.\u201d\nDefense spending has never fallen below 3 percent of GDP in the modern era, and Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign is calling for 4 percent of GDP to be spent on the military. It\u2019s also worth noting that in addition to what\u2019s detailed in the Dept of Defense budget, there\u2019s a full array of military spending related to nuclear weapons stashed in the Department of Energy\u2019s budget as well. \u00a0The upshot is that to meet the spending caps consistent with Ryan\u2019s views on the appropriate level of military spending would require us to pretty much have to completely dismantle the rest of the federal government.\nI\u2019m sorry, but if the multinational corporations think their tax rates are overly burdensome and want to pay less in taxes, then it\u2019s time for us to start closing a large number of overseas bases protecting their interests. \u00a0Let them fund their own protection out of their budgets instead. \u00a0Oh, and while we\u2019re at it \u2026 maybe we should charge them to use the roads that we pay for through our taxes, those taxes they don\u2019t want to pay.\nSo What Does It All Mean and What are the Differences between Ryan\u2019s \u201cPath\u201d and the President\u2019s Proposal?\nCBO estimates spending at 24.4 percent of GDP in 2022. Obama\u2019s budget would hold it to 22.8 percent. And Ryan\u2019s budget would keep it at 20.25 percent. \u00a0CBO projects public debt will rise to 94.2 percent of GDP by 2022. Obama\u2019s budget would hold it to 76.5 percent. Ryan\u2019s budget, according to CBO, would hold it to 70 percent. So Obama and Ryan\u2019s budgets are fairly close on debt over the next decade.\nDespite all of Ryan\u2019s pessimistic negativity in his \u201cPath for Prosperity\u201d the bottom-line differences in dollars spent and dollars received aren\u2019t all that great over the long run. \u00a0Yes, Ryan\u2019s numbers are lower\u00a0but, consider that the CBO analyzed Ryan\u2019s budget last April, and the CBO\u2019s economic outlook has worsened since then. Thus, if the CBO ran the numbers on his proposal today, the dimmer economic outlook they\u2019re projecting would likely lead to, at the least, more debt than he\u2019s acknowledging. \u00a0Plus, given that he\u2019s going to be cutting the crap out of \u201cgovernment\u201d \u2014 translated to \u201cfiring\u201d a whole lot of worthless government workers and bureaucrats (Romney would love that) \u2014 my guess would be that his projected \u201crevenue\u201d will be far less than anticipated, given that those folks he intends to fire aren\u2019t going to be paying all that much in taxes anytime soon.\nCome November, will you choose a future in which a middle class can thrive again in America like it did for 50 years after the New Deal, up until Ronald Reagan blew everything up? \u00a0If you really want the American Dream back \u2014 to be able to go to college without incurring grievous amounts of debt, to be able to have a good job and reliable healthcare, to live life knowing that an accident or illness won\u2019t wipe you out \u2014 then we need to work as hard as we can to kick these radical, reactionary Republicans out of government!\nResources:\n"}, {"score": 887.89325, "uuid": "03c82698-c434-5766-9e7a-f99b6c8d5e13", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-37-18445", "target_hostname": "www.dcourier.com", "target_uri": "http://www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=36&SubsectionID=73&ArticleID=103824", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Letter: Disdain for &#x27;<em>Obamacare</em>&#x27; <em>is</em> based on ignorance - The Prescott Daily", "snippet": "One.........the uneducated who <em>really</em> don&#x27;t know <em>any</em> <em>better</em> and truly believe that President Obama <em>is</em> a Socialist based upon right-wing propaganda and two..........the educated who DO know <em>better</em> but feed the political fugue and stupidity because they hate our present President.", "explanation": null, "document": "Letter: Disdain for 'Obamacare' is based on ignorance\nEDITOR:\nWhat is invariably referred to in all of the media as Obamacare, which is only a very partial move toward a National Health Service, has become a pejorative term for many Americans.

It does not produce superior results and is acknowledged to be increasingly financially untenable as our population ages. Continuing \"as is\" is not a viable long-term option.\nNational Health Services have existed in most first-world countries for the past half-century. Although they do not function perfectly, indications are that most users value their National Health Services so highly that they would never want to give them up and revert to the sort of antiquated system that we still have. In other words, despite government bureaucracy and whatever specific shortcomings exist in each of the National Health Services, they seem to be those programs with the highest popularity ratings among their users.\nPersonally, my family and I have experienced medical care with several National Health Services, and we have no significant complaints.

Today, (3-1-12) the Senate voted 51-48 to table this critical bill that would have restored ALL Americans\u2019 First-Amendment rights to the place our forefathers intended in the Constitution.\nIn the past 48 hours, Liberty Counsel Action team members stormed Capitol Hill with a petition bearing the names of almost 70,000 citizens and flooded Senate offices with tens of thousands of faxes. But this is only the beginning of our fight for our precious freedom of conscience! See my very important update below \u2013 Mat.\nThere is an outcry across our nation today. Americans\u2019 religious liberties have once again been trampled upon by President Obama and his sycophants in Harry Reid\u2019s Senate.\nToday\u2019s vote in the Senate exposed those legislators who are squarely in Obama\u2019s socialist camp and plan to advocate ObamaCare\u2019s unconstitutional mandates to the end.\nSenator Roy Blunt, the author of the Blunt Amendment, said this following the vote\u2026\n\u201cInstead of working to pass a bipartisan measure that has been part of our law\u2026this debate has been burdened by outlandish and divisive efforts to misinform and frighten Americans.\nUnfortunately, this is only a glimpse of what Americans can expect as a result of President Obama\u2019s government health care takeover \u2013 which is why we need to repeal and replace this bill with common-sense bipartisan solutions.\nThis fight is not over. I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers of Congress to protect the rights that make our nation great.\u201d\n++As Senator Blunt says, this fight is NOT over!\nWe have taken names and these Senators will be held accountable for their vote! Liberty Counsel Action\u2019s forthcoming Congressional Scorecard will add the outcome of this vote to our findings and those legislators who are up for reelection will feel the peoples\u2019 displeasure at the voting booth.\nBut first, with today\u2019s defeat in the Senate, Congressman Jeff Fortenberry\u2019s \u201cRespect for Rights of Conscience Act,\u201d takes center stage. It is similar to the Blunt Amendment and is making its way through the House of Representatives. It now has 220 co-sponsors.\nRepresentative Fortenberry wrote that his Act, \u201c\u2026would repeal the controversial [ObamaCare] mandate, amending the 2010 health care law to preserve conscience rights for religious institutions, health care providers, and small businesses who pay for health care coverage.\u201d\nHere\u2019s my pledge to you: Liberty Counsel Action will diligently work to get Representative Fortenberry\u2019s bill to a floor vote \u2013 and passed!\nThat\u2019s why I am announcing a second delivery of our petition, \u201cStop Barack Obama's subversion of our religious civil liberties and conscience rights!\u201d to members of the House of Representatives.\nI truly believe that the ObamaCare battleground we are fighting on now may be the toughest political fight we face in our lifetime.\nI need to know that you are with me in this battle. We can deliver 100,000 signatures to the House \u2013 but I must have your name on this petition to get this vital legislation passed \u2013 and to stop Barack Obama\u2019s tyrannical assault on our religious liberties.\nHere are two ways you can help:\nFirst, please consider telling your friends and family about our nationwide initiative by using one of the social media share tools below.\nSecond, call your representative and encourage the Congressman to pass Rep. Fortenberry's \"Respect for Rights of Conscience Act.\"\n++Defeating ObamaCare means defeating the mandates!\nLiberty Counsel Action\u2019s sister organization, Liberty Counsel, is confronting this latest ObamaCare mandate by seeking an outright declaration that the President\u2019s healthcare \u201creform\u201d law is unconstitutional at the U.S. Supreme Court. Liberty Counsel has filed two vital briefs to the Court and the hearings will begin in just a few weeks.\nBut Liberty Counsel Action can stop the mandates in the legislature and we MUST do everything possible to end this tyrannical government take-over of the American medical services industry!\nThe stakes are dramatically higher because now, even our God-given freedom of conscience is at stake!\nPlease, sign our petition to the House of Representatives:\nhttp://www.lcaction.cc/660/petition.asp\nI am honored to say that our wonderful Liberty Counsel Action team bombarded Capitol Hill in the past 48 hours.

Don\u2019t they know that Obamacare is in the Constitution? Challenging this super duper law that will let everyone live forever without fear of a heart attack or stroke is a big fat waste of time. Everyone knows that. Get with the program. A challenge to Obamacare does not have a snowball\u2019s chance in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Resistance is futile. Listen to your betters and obey.\nFrom Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller and then-Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray on April 2, 2010 :\nNobody can seriously argue that the health care industry operates only in \u201cintrastate\u201d commerce and that the mandate provisions in this bill cannot be effectively disentangled from the comprehensive economic approach that Congress adopted to fix the deep flaws in our current health insurance system.\nWe live under mandates every day. Without them, society as we know it would disintegrate. Every criminal law tells us what we cannot do.\nAnd sometimes the law tells us what we must do. Congress can require young Americans to register for the draft to serve in the military, for example, or can require us all to pay taxes for programs like Social Security and Medicare.\nWe can \u2014 and do \u2014 argue about what shape these laws should take, without claiming that our leaders are constitutionally barred from dealing with our most pressing problems.\nInstead of pursuing lawsuits, we should work to find ways to improve the lives of the American people and protect our four most fundamental freedoms: of speech, of religion, from want and from fear.\nFreedom from want and from free. It\u2019s in the Constitution, alongside the right to sing the blues.\nFrom Jonathan Cohn on April 24, 2010 :\nMost legal experts seem to think the lawsuits won\u2019t succeed. Among other things, it turns out that the U.S. fought a large war, about a hundred and fifty years ago, in order to settle the issue of state nullification. But if the officials filing these suits seem not to understand that history\u2013or at least, not to care about it \u2014 their opposition to the Affordable Care Act, like their supporters\u2019, seems genuine. If they had their way, their states really would reject the new health care law.\nYou see, opposing Obamacare makes you part of the Confederate States of America and that makes you a racist.\nFor shame.\nFrom Randy E. Barnett on March 21, 2010 :\nCan Congress really require that every person purchase health insurance from a private company or face a penalty? The answer lies in the commerce clause of the Constitution, which grants Congress the power \u201cto regulate commerce . . . among the several states.\u201d Historically, insurance contracts were not considered commerce, which referred to trade and carriage of merchandise. That\u2019s why insurance has traditionally been regulated by states. But the Supreme Court has long allowed Congress to regulate and prohibit all sorts of \u201ceconomic\u201d activities that are not, strictly speaking, commerce. The key is that those activities substantially affect interstate commerce, and that\u2019s how the court would probably view the regulation of health insurance.\nThere you have it. Constitutional. Now go away.\nYou are still there? OK, read this slowly \u2014 without moving your lips.\nFrom the Atlantic Wire on March 23, 2010 :\nWhy court challenges will fail\nMandates Are Constitutional. The Daily Beast\u2019s Adam Winkler defends the Constitutionality of the mandate. \u201cBecause the individual mandate is a tax provision that promotes the general welfare, it is within Congress\u2019 taxing power. This is one of broadest grants of authority the Constitution gives Congress.\u201d He quips, \u201cIn fact, the Founding Fathers themselves included an \u2018individual mandate\u2019 in a law way back in 1792.\u201d They wrote a law requiring \u201cfree able-bodied\u201d serve in militias\u2013with a gun they had to buy on their own.\nCourts Give Congress Power Here. The New York Times\u2019 John Schwartz writes, \u201cThe broad extent of the government\u2019s power to regulate interstate commerce has been recognized since the Roosevelt administration. In fact, courts have backed Congress\u2019s ability to regulate under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, even when the issues might not seem, at first blush, to even involve interstate commerce at all.\u201d\nCan\u2019t Be Challenged Until 2014. The Washington Independent\u2019s David Weigel reports, \u201cThe problem with a challenge, say conservatives, is that the mandate for health care \u2014 an idea with origins on the right that has become anathema ever since its implementation in Massachusetts \u2014 will not take effect until 2014. Whether attorneys general can successfully challenge the mandate until then is unclear.\u201d By then, the anti-health care fire will have died down considerably.\nWinning Isn\u2019t the Real Reason To Challenge. The Atlantic\u2019s Marc Ambinder says conservatives get it. \u201cThe chances of success in the Supreme Court are low, but the point of the lawsuits isn\u2019t legal \u2014 it\u2019s political. It advances the politics of conservative jurisprudence, and the political ambitions of conservatives, and it keeps the legislation itself in a state of suspended political animation.\u201d\nGot that last one? They see through you. This is not about a legal case. This is about politics. Embarrassing the president.\nYou are doomed. Doomed. Surrender Dorothy.\nFrom Frank Rich on March 27, 2010 :\nWhen Social Security was passed by Congress in 1935 and Medicare in 1965, there was indeed heated opposition. As Dana Milbank wrote in The Washington Post, Alf Landon built his catastrophic 1936 presidential campaign on a call for repealing Social Security. (Democrats can only pray that the G.O.P. will \u201cgo for it\u201d again in 2010, as Obama goaded them on Thursday, and keep demanding repeal of a bill that by September will shower benefits on the elderly and children alike.) When L.B.J. scored his Medicare coup, there were the inevitable cries of \u201csocialism\u201d along with ultimately empty rumblings of a boycott from the American Medical Association.\nBut there was nothing like this. To find a prototype for the overheated reaction to the health care bill, you have to look a year before Medicare, to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Both laws passed by similar majorities in Congress; the Civil Rights Act received even more votes in the Senate (73) than Medicare (70). But it was only the civil rights bill that made some Americans run off the rails. That\u2019s because it was the one that signaled an inexorable and immutable change in the very identity of America, not just its governance.\nThe apocalyptic predictions then, like those about health care now, were all framed in constitutional pieties, of course. Barry Goldwater, running for president in \u201964, drew on the counsel of two young legal allies, William Rehnquist and Robert Bork, to characterize the bill as a \u201cthreat to the very essence of our basic system\u201d and a \u201cusurpation\u201d of states\u2019 rights that \u201cwould force you to admit drunks, a known murderer or an insane person into your place of business.\u201d Richard Russell, the segregationist Democratic senator from Georgia, said the bill \u201cwould destroy the free enterprise system.\u201d David Lawrence, a widely syndicated conservative columnist, bemoaned the establishment of \u201ca federal dictatorship.\u201d Meanwhile, three civil rights workers were murdered in Philadelphia, Miss.\nThat a tsunami of anger is gathering today is illogical, given that what the right calls \u201cObamacare\u201d is less provocative than either the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or Medicare, an epic entitlement that actually did precipitate a government takeover of a sizable chunk of American health care. But the explanation is plain: the health care bill is not the main source of this anger and never has been. It\u2019s merely a handy excuse. The real source of the over-the-top rage of 2010 is the same kind of national existential reordering that roiled America in 1964.\nYou see it? You teabaggers are doomed \u2014 doomed \u2014 and you will kill black men out of your misplaced anger.\nGive up now before it is too late and people die.\nBecause it is hopeless.\nFrom John Schwartz on March 22, 2010 :\nBut constitutional scholars suggest that such cases would likely amount to no more than a speed bump for health care legislation.\nThe reason, they say, is that Congress has framed the mandate as a tax, which it has well-established powers to create. And Congress\u2019s sweeping authority to regulate the nation\u2019s economy, they add, has been clear since the 1930s.\n\u201cThe attack on this bill,\u201d said Jack M. Balkin, a professor of constitutional law at Yale University, \u201cis not merely an attack on the substance of this particular measure. It\u2019s also a challenge to understandings that come with the New Deal.\u201d\nDoomed. For as Frank Rich correctly forecast on March 27, 2010: \u201cDemocrats can only pray that the G.O.P. \u2018will go for it\u2019 again in 2010, as Obama goaded them on Thursday, and keep demanding repeal of a bill that by September will shower benefits on the elderly and children alike.\u201d\nAnd he was absolutely correct, just as sure as my name is Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.\n"}, {"score": 873.5553, "uuid": "084d3064-a3bc-5bc7-9849-de901bb85232", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1416wb-51-08714", "target_hostname": "www.senior.org", "target_uri": "http://www.senior.org/index.php/2-uncategorised-uncategorised/51-is-obamacare-in-trouble-report-from-the-supreme-court", "page_rank": 1.183005e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "The Seniors Coalition - <em>Is</em> <em>ObamaCare</em> in Trouble?", "snippet": "<em>Is</em> <em>ObamaCare</em> in Trouble?", "explanation": null}, {"score": 872.8411, "uuid": "b7a2970e-f069-5027-9f94-3754816b295c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0916wb-18-30091", "target_hostname": "www.crnc.org", "target_uri": "http://www.crnc.org/2012/02/22/the-american-economy-deserves-better-than-current-regulatory-and-tax-policies/", "page_rank": 1.1734448e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "<em>than</em> Current", "snippet": "The American Economy Deserves <em>Better</em> <em>than</em> Current Regulatory and Tax Policies A friend and I were talking today about just how difficult it will be to explain current memes to future generations.

By and large this is a problem that past generations really didn\u2019t have to deal with.\nSure the 1920s may have a hard time explaining their love of mah-jongg, the 50s would need to make clear why poodle skirts were in fashion, and the 70s should clarify why pet rocks and Sea Monkeys were ever considered cool.\nBut surely they all have a better explanation that we have for planking, or better yet, Rickrolling someone.\nAnd yet the absurdity of our federal government somehow manages to make today\u2019s internet memes seem downright sane by comparison. Since Democrats have taken the reins in Washington the government continues to grow, but in ways that make less and less sense.\nTake Dodd-Frank as an example. Following the economic collapse of 2007, most everyone agreed that some level of reform was needed in the financial sector to attempt to prevent a similar crisis from happening in the future. The Democrats\u2019 solution, best known by its two primary authors Dodd-Frank, doesn\u2019t really address the very visible problems. Rather than eliminate, it enshrined \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d and rather than reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, it left them completely alone.\nRather than reform we got more government. A lot more government.\nThe bill spans 848 pages, but not even that properly reflects its true length. For instance, the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d that bans restricts proprietary trading, only takes up 11 pages of the law, but the five federal agencies charged to enact it issued a 298 page proposal. For the sake of comparison, The Economist found that \u201cthe law that set up America\u2019s banking system in 1965 ran to 29 pages; the Federal Reserve of 1913 went to 32 pages; the Banking Act that transformed finance after the Wall Street Crash, commonly known as the Glass-Steagall Act, spread out to 37 pages.\u201d\nTo be fair, length is only one, rather crude way to measure its impact on the economy. But the point is, Dodd-Frank, as well as other recent legislation (the 2,000 pages Obamacare bill chief among them) threaten to stifle the economy with so many overlapping rules, red tape, and regulations that businesses won\u2019t know which way is up.\nIn the Democrats quest to constantly do something, they\u2019ve created a Washington monster that feeds on its citizens. Rather than stop and take a moment to actually identify a problem, establish what government break-down led to the problem, and then take limited steps to address it, Democrats simply tack on some additional bureaucracy or create some new regulatory agency and call the problem solved.\nA similar trend can be seen in the tax code where something that should fit on a postcard has grown so large that no one really knows just how big it is (most estimates are around 7 million words spanning roughly 9,500 pages).\nSuch complexity has real consequences. Take next January as a prime example. As the Washington Post reports:\n\u201cOn Dec. 31, the George W. Bush-era tax cuts are scheduled to expire, raising tax rates on investment income, estates and gifts, and earnings at all levels. Overnight, the marriage penalty for joint filers will spring back to life, the value of the child tax credit will drop from $1,000 to $500, and the rate everyone pays on the first $8,700 of wages will jump from 10 to 1 percent.\nThe Social Security payroll tax will pop back up to 6.2 percent from the 4.2 percent under the deal approved Friday by Congress. And new Medicare taxes enacted as part of President Obama\u2019s health-care initiative will for the first time strike high-income households.\u201d\nAnd all of it would come at a crucial time for our nation\u2019s fragile economy. This is not a tax code that looks like it was designed on purpose. It\u2019s a hodgepodge of rules that have been piled one on top of the other until any sense of original purpose was lost.\nMeme\u2019s may be difficult to explain, but at least there is some humor in trying. The Democrats recent policies, coupled with their aversion to reform, is impossible to explain, and truly frustrating to try.\n"}], [{"score": 870.5049, "uuid": "46b147de-d946-580c-8943-d4592344531d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1307wb-29-22908", "target_hostname": "americasmedicalsociety.com", "target_uri": "http://americasmedicalsociety.com/obamacare-exposes-the-malpractice-of-organized-medicine/", "page_rank": 1.2947862e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "<em>Obamacare</em> Exposes the Malpractice of Organized Medicine | America&#x27;s Medical", "snippet": "Peer Review\u201d <em>is</em> <em>really</em> \u201dPhysician Peer Review Fraud\u201d.", "explanation": null, "document": "Obamacare Exposes the Malpractice of Organized Medicine\nDecember 21, 2011\nThursday, December 22, 2011 \u2013 Medicine and Politics in America by Adam Frederic Dorin, M.D., MBA \u2026. {Doctor Dorin\u2019s most recent column at the Washington Times: http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/medicine-and-politics-america/2011/dec/22/obamacare-exposes-malpractice-organized-medicine/ }\nTechnology has come a long way in the last twenty years since I finished my residency in anesthesiology and critical care medicine atJohnsHopkinsUniversity. Back then, in the early nineties, doctors read newspapers, journals and magazines on paper; it took more effort to put out these publications, and a great deal of effort was placed by editors and writers to effect a \u2018scientific\u2019 balance for the reader. Even when tackling political subjects, there was a professional pride and ethos which imparted an implicit demand for honesty.\nToday\u2019s world of cyber particles and LED screens pushes an overload of information which requires no more than the toggle of a button to instantly send out information to millions of potential recipients and readers. In the modern medium of publishing, it is easy to cover a broad breadth of subjects, and even easier to be prolific. The twenty-first century physician must be in command of the latest breakthroughs, medical innovations, pharmaceuticals, and even political machinations, all of which have profound implications for the delivery of medical services and bedside care.\nIf you research the writings of the American Medical Association over the last few years, since the topic of healthcare reform and health insurance reform have resurfaced in the political arena, you will notice a very marked bias in their writings. It is common knowledge that today\u2019s AMA is a left-leaning organization\u2014one which has openly espoused support for \u2018universal\u2019, socialized-type medicine on a national scale.\nWe must remind ourselves, however, of how far the AMA has veered from its historical path. There was a time when the AMA did not vote pocketbook over principle; and did not promote the expansion of the third-party system for payment of medical services. (* Doctor Edward Annis, President of the AMA in the early 1960s, speaks in the videos below)\n* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFesycofKk4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqVkOlhbsEM\nMany may recall the AMA\u2019s \u2018secret pact\u2019 with the federal government, originating decades ago through a deal made with the precursor to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), then known as HCFA (Health Care Finance Administration).\nDetails of this pact can be found in the archives of the AAPS Website \u2013 http://www.jpands.org/hacienda/article1.html and the website of America\u2019s Medical Society , all thanks to the original research and investigation done by AAPS General Counsel, Andrew Schlafly. The fact that this \u2018secret pact\u2019 has delivered approximately 70-100 million dollars annually in recent years to the AMA from exclusively copyright royalties (for the medical billing codes used by all health insurance carriers in the United States) should not be lost on the reader.\nNote that the AMA has a membership base of only about 15% of all practicing American doctors at best; this membership has been declining over the years, and these royalties to the AMA have precluded their need to cater to the needs of the majority of physicians in independent practice.\nContrary to the positions of most doctors in America, the AMA and many of its feeder state medical societies demonstrate a bias as it pertains to the \u2018Affordable Care Act\u2019 (their publications evoke an uncomfortable sense that they remain in promotion and implementation mode for the \u2018Act\u2019, despite such continued widespread concern and debate within the medical community): For example\u2026\n\u00b7AMA website:\u00a0 http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/strategic-issues.page\n\u00b7New Haven County Medical Association, \u201cHealth System Reform Insight,\u201d June 3, 2011 http://www.nhcma.org/national_060311.html\n\u00b7Iowa Medical Society, February 10, 2011: \u201cNew Resource Helps Put Prevention Into Practice for Seniors\u201d http://www.iowamedical.org/news_detail.cfm?newsID=408\nWhat may be less obvious, but no less interesting, is the coverage of healthcare reform by third party journals and magazines, many of which cater to the healthcare community in the areas of nursing, medicine, outpatient surgery and the biomedical industry.\u00a0 One would think that these venues would have an obligation to write on political matters, or even to stay neutral in the debate.\u00a0 No reader could possibly ignore the paramount significance that healthcare reform has on literally every aspect of the American medical system, so it would be expected that healthcare reform would be openly and vigorously debated.\nOne would think that there would be clearly an onus, even an imperative, to discuss medical insurance reform, tort reform, inter-state health insurance competition, scope of practice barriers between physicians and non-physicians, and so forth. Editors in the medical arena would have to consciously work very hard to avoid including the healthcare reform debate in their publications, but many have done just that by exercising perhaps the most powerful journalistic tool at their disposal: silence.\nTry querying \u2018health care reform\u2019 and the name of one of the many trade journals or medical newsletters in your favorite Internet search engine to test out this premise. Many of the largest such periodicals have proven themselves irrelevant by avoiding the subject altogether.\nSilence is a powerful weapon in our age of rapid communication; many in positions of influence, such as medical newsletter editors and local medical society directors, have scurrilously decided to ignore the \u2018Affordable Care Act\u2019\u2014hoping instead that by doing so the \u2018Act\u2019 will find quiet implementation and transform society to their liking.\u00a0 Rather than shed light on the most important \u2018transformative\u2019 process in the lives of any practicing physician (or patient), many such media have focused their attention on lesser local, state and federal legislative issues. One can conjure up the metaphor of a squirrel getting busy storing nuts under a tree which is shaking with every movement of the hacksaw at its trunk; even though the ground is shaking and leaves are falling at a precipitous rate, the animal goes about its daily business as if nothing new is happening at all.\u00a0 Dutiful observers can see the bigger picture as the tree is felled and the landscape reshaped around it, making any concern over lesser housekeeping chores irrelevant.\u00a0 No one is fooled by this charade.\nOf late, it seems, political leaders in and out of the field of medicine, are toting the line \u2018we need reform anyway\u2019 to justify the shortcomings, under-estimated costs, and trampling of liberties meted out in the thousands of pages of the \u2018Affordable Care Act\u2019 health care reform legislation.\nMore formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), or to some merely Obamacare, the \u2018Act\u2019 has dividedAmerica. Regardless of the outcome of the legal challenges (slated for the Supreme Court\u2019s review beginning this March 2012), this contentious law was designed to gradually centralize and nationalize the way health care is delivered and paid for in America. The subject of Obamacare is sure to dominate the 2012 election cycle.\nSome may disagree on the legality of its application of the Commerce Clause, but none can disagree that the PPACA law seeks to dominate, control, and \u2018manage\u2019 health care from a more centralized, federal focal point and in a way unprecedented inU.S.history.\nThe recent rulings on the PPACA law by the Federal Appellate Court in Atlanta (the \u2018Eleventh Circuit Court\u2019) and a District Court in Pennsylvania\u2013which found the \u2018individual mandate\u2019 that all Americans must purchase the new federal health insurance to be unconstitutional\u2013afford some degree of comfort to those who are opposed to Obamacare.\nThe 11th Circuit court curiously also ruled, however, that, despite the absence of a severability clause in the \u2018Act\u2019, the rest of the law could be implemented without the individual mandate component. Whether the oddly named \u2018Affordable Care Act\u2019 could survive external legislative funding cuts, or the absence of internal funding via the individual mandate, may be a moot point. Ultimately, the legality of Obamacare will be settled at the level of the Supreme Court.\nAs it was with the scurried passage of the bill by the Democrats in sequestered Congressional halls, the name of this game for die-hard liberals in medical circles is simply survival:\u00a0 will the bill survive to see the light of full implementation in 2014, or will it be killed by legislative and electoral fiat or be summarily quashed by the Supreme Court?\nWhittled away as Obamacare may be by the current Republican-controlled House of Representatives, the \u2018Act\u2019 still lives and breathes and grows. The Democrats who crafted it did so with adept skill and--until the recent, heightened attention about our national debt crisis\u2014questionable funding. To some, it seems that the PPACA law was cleverly designed to hobble its way through the next presidential election cycle if necessary.\nRegardless of political persuasion, the \u2018Act\u2019 is a bold demonstration of what some would call the corruption of power in government. Those who created it did so with fervent speed after the election of Barack Obama, seemingly more so to grab federal power and re-shape their vision of federalism; those who took over control of Congress in 2010 have likewise moved with hastiness to undo what they possibly could to reduce the impact of the liberal agenda.\u00a0 Even the well-intentioned Ryan Plan to reform Medicare was left vulnerable to political gamesmanship\u2014a regrettable consequence of the power of \u2018power\u2019.\nMake no mistake about it, the elite minority who control the medical establishment inAmericado so with unyielding focus on their out-of-step agenda. What may seem like gentlemanly protocol at first blush is instead the most blatant form of dishonesty. Likewise, the strange, oblique silence of liberal editors, intended to avoid and subdue the debate about healthcare reform in this country, should be exposed and broken.\nFor more on this subject and related matters, see www.AmericasMedicalSociety.com .\nShare This\n"}, {"score": 870.18634, "uuid": "9e090e88-45bc-58a8-8207-607d25e17373", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1416wb-51-08707", "target_hostname": "www.senior.org", "target_uri": "http://www.senior.org/index.php/2-uncategorised/51-is-obamacare-in-trouble-report-from-the-supreme-court", "page_rank": 1.2109922e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "The Seniors Coalition - <em>Is</em> <em>ObamaCare</em> in Trouble?", "snippet": "<em>Is</em> <em>ObamaCare</em> in Trouble?", "explanation": null}, {"score": 867.9618, "uuid": "8277f9a3-8acf-5c53-a351-681d533ee8fb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1000tw-91-09485", "target_hostname": "www.atlassociety.org", "target_uri": "http://www.atlassociety.org/tni/obamacare-rx-crisis", "page_rank": 1.4461287e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "<em>ObamaCare</em>: Rx for Crisis | The New Individualist | The Atlas Society", "snippet": "\u201c<em>ObamaCare</em>\u201d), the Big Hospital Lobby finally succeeded. <em>ObamaCare</em> prevents <em>any</em> physician-owned specialty hospitals built after 2010 from treating <em>Medicare</em> patients.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nMarch 7, 2012 -- When people think of Medicare, they usually think of the government health insurance program for seniors over age 65. They may even recall that the program also extends to the disabled who are under 65. Few, though, see it as a program that big business and their D.C. lobbyists can use to drive smaller competitors out of business.\nBut that\u2019s a perspective shared by many individuals who work in physician-owned specialty hospitals (PSHs). For years the \u201cBig Hospital Lobby\u201d waged war on physician-owned specialty hospitals, trying to drive the latter out of business by making it illegal for them to treat Medicare patients, a major revenue source.\nWith the March 2010 passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. \u201cObamaCare\u201d), the Big Hospital Lobby finally succeeded. ObamaCare prevents any physician-owned specialty hospitals built after 2010 from treating Medicare patients. Additionally, those PSHs already in existence will no longer be able to expand unless they jump through nearly insurmountable regulatory hoops.\nBy limiting the access that physician-owned specialty hospitals have to Medicare, the big hospitals, which are often bureaucratic, have protected themselves from smaller, quicker competition. In so doing, they have choked off a major source of efficiency and innovation in the health care system and limited patients\u2019 options.\nObamaCare all but guarantees that no new physician-owned specialty hospitals will be built.\nThe physician-owned specialty hospitals that have emerged since the early 1990s tend to specialize in one of three areas: cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery, and general surgery. Cardiac surgery is, of course, surgery on the heart, such as bypass surgery or angioplasty. Orthopedic surgery targets conditions of the musculoskeletal system and includes surgeries such as hip and knee replacements, spine fusion, and carpal tunnel surgery. General surgery is a specialty that deals with everything between the neck and the waist, with the exception of the cardio-vascular system. (Some general surgeons are qualified to perform vascular surgery and occasionally do so. Otherwise, vascular surgery is performed by vascular surgeons.) It includes many types of cancer, colorectal, and trauma surgeries.\nPhysicians who want to start a PSH usually join together as a group, putting up their own money. Often the physician group will partner with a private firm that specializes in opening PSHs. In that case, the physicians and the private firm will each get an ownership share of the PSH. Each individual physician receives an ownership share based on how much he or she invested in the PSH. Most physicians who invest in a PSH have ownership shares of about 2%, although some shares are as high as 15%, according to 2005 government statistics. At the end of the year, each physician-owner gets a percentage of the PSH profits based on his ownership share.\nRegina Herzlinger (at right), a business professor at Harvard who has studied medical specialization in depth, argues that PSHs should be allowed to become the wave of the future in health care. Many businesses have become specialized, focusing on a few tasks and contracting out other services when needed. This enables them to do a few things well, providing better quality and lower prices for consumers.\nHerzlinger laments the fact that there are so few PSHs:\nThese results are unfortunate: Specialized healthcare facilities, partially owned by entrepreneurial physicians, represent the best hope for a higher-quality and higher-productivity healthcare system. The specialization integrates care that consumers must now struggle to obtain from a system organized by separate providers. Along the way, it reduces costs. And ownership provides an important additional incentive for physicians to provide the best value for the money. (Regina E. Herzlinger, \u201cSpecialization and Its Discontents: The Pernicious Impact of Regulations Against Specialization and Physicians Ownership on the US Healthcare System,\u201d Circulation, 2004, Vol. 109, No. 20, pp. 2376-8.)\nThe hospitals that most Americans are accustomed to are what are most appropriately called \u201cgeneral hospitals.\u201d They are often large institutions and highly bureaucratic. They tend to practice many types of medicine under one roof, including primary care, emergency care, many types of surgery, radiation treatment, imaging services, laboratory services, psychiatry, physical therapy, palliative care, diabetes management, maternity care, etc.\nThanks\u00a0to ObamaCare, patients will have little opportunity to choose between physician-owned speciality hospitals (PSHs) and general hospitals. Here\u2019s why: to receive payments from Medicare for treating Medicare patients, a hospital must have a \u201cMedicare provider number.\u201d ObamaCare prevents any hospital in which physicians are part owners from receiving a Medicare provider number after December 31, 2010. Physician-owned specialty hospitals treat many Medicare patients since the elderly are disproportionately the ones receiving cardiac, orthopedic, and cancer surgery. This means that PSHs receive a large portion of their revenue from Medicare.\u00a0Obviously, physicians won\u2019t start new PSHs if a major source of revenue is no longer available.\nThe new restrictions all but end a major source of innovation in the health care system\nWhen businesses face new competition\u2014as general hospitals faced from PSHs\u2014they have two basic recourses. They can find ways to lower their costs and improve their products, thereby preventing their competitors from drawing away customers. Or they can ask politicians to pass laws and regulations that will drive their competition out of business. Since Medicare is such a large portion of all medical payments, the second recourse is the preferred option for those already established in the business of health care. ObamaCare was the culmination of a decade-long effort by the Big Hospital Lobby\u2014represented by the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals\u2014to use Medicare to stop PSHs.\nOf course, companies will almost never admit that they are using government to drive their competition out of business. The resulting negative press could undermine the effort. Rather, they dress it up in the rhetoric of the \u201cnoble purpose.\u201d\u00a0As one supporter of PSHs put it, the Big Hospital Lobby \u201chides behind their community mission\u201d in order to \u201cstifle competition.\u201d (Mark Sherman, \u201cMedicare bill clamps down on physician-owned specialty hospitals, Associated Press, November 26, 2003.)\nThe Big Hospital Lobby advanced two main arguments to make its case that PSHs endangered public welfare. First, the Lobby claimed that physician ownership of a hospital was a \u201cconflict of interest.\u201d\u00a0A physician who profited from his ownership of a hospital might refer a patient for surgery, even if the patient didn\u2019t need surgery. This would result in not only unnecessary surgeries, but an increase in the total number of surgeries. That would increase costs for Medicare and, ultimately, the taxpayer.\nSecond, the Lobby argued that physician owners would \u201ccherry pick\u201d their patients, referring relatively healthier patients and those with more generous insurance plans to their PSHs. Both result in higher profits. That would leave general hospitals in an even worse financial condition since they would be stuck with the sicker and thus more costly patients and the ones with low-paying insurance like Medicaid or no insurance at all.\nIn short, PSHs should be stopped because they harmed both patients and the public. Ironically, PSHs had emerged only because Congress had already cut physicians\u2019 investment opportunities.\nThe Rise of Physician-Owned Specialty Hospitals\nWhile there are many factors that led to the rise of PSHs, three seem to be key. The first was the growing authority of hospital administrators. During the 1980s and 1990s, hospitals consolidated, leading to more authority for hospital administrators and reduced autonomy for physicians. By and large an independent-minded lot, physicians have desired greater control over their practice, something they can achieve when they are part owners of a hospital.\nAnother factor was the implementation of new price control systems that Medicare established in the 1980s and 1990s for paying hospitals and physicians. These systems overpay for some types of medical procedures while underpaying for others. Cardiac and orthopedic care are areas where Medicare appears to overpay. One pair of scholars argues that the rise of PSHs is a \u201cmarket signal\u201d that Medicare is overpaying for certain types of medical procedures. (Jack Hadley and Stephen Zuckerman, \u201cPhysician-Owned Specialty Hospitals: A Market Signal For Medicare Payment Revisions,\u201d Health Affairs, October 25, 2005) Nevertheless, the introduction of Medicare\u2019s price control system inadvertently resulted in new financial opportunities for physicians.\nAt one time the health care system was teeming with such opportunities for physicians, but Congress circumscribed many of them with laws passed in 1989 and 1993. In the late 1980s controversy erupted over \u201cphysician self-referral,\u201d the practice of a physician referring a patient to a medical facility of which the physician is part owner. Around the country, physicians were investing in clinical laboratories and imaging centers. The debate centered on the ethics and costs of such arrangements. Some theorized that physician-investors would have an incentive to refer patients for unnecessary tests. That would, in turn, result in greater costs for both private insurance and government health care programs. Research conducted at the time, including two studies by the Government Accountability Office, found that physicians who were owners of medical facilities referred patients to those facilities for tests at a higher rate than did non-owners.\nObamaCare prevents any hospital in which physicians are part owners from receiving a Medicare provider number after December 31, 2010.\nCongress soon took an interest in clamping down on physician self-referral, since more medical tests meant higher costs for programs like Medicare. The main politician in this effort was Representative Fortney \u201cPete\u201d Stark (D-CA). In 1972, Stark successfully ran for the House of Representatives from Oakland, California. By the time physician self-referral became an issue in the late 1980s,\u00a0Stark chaired the Health subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee, despite having no background in the health care field.\nMaybe Stark was chosen because of his empathy for patients. Writing in the L. A. Times, Dr. Jane M. Orient noted that Stark (pictured below) once \u201cexplained to an audience of managed-care administrators, patients either consider themselves \u2018invincible\u2019 when feeling well or they are \u2018absolutely irrational, brain dead, sniveling, begging, and fantasizing ills and pains.\u2019\u201d\nOr maybe it was his sympathetic ear for physicians. Referring to physician complaints about low Medicare reimbursement, he replied, \u201cLast time I looked in my district, I didn\u2019t see any Porsche dealers going out of business because the doctors are all going broke.\u201d This was the man that Congress tasked with protecting patients from physicians who owned medical facilities.\nWhose interest was really being served by restricting the ability of physicians to own medical facilities? \u201cThere\u2019s been no patient uproar over this stuff. Self-referral is a political issue, not a quality or cost issue,\u201d said Angus Everton, general counsel for the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland. In fact, the research conducted on the issue seemed to focus exclusively on the rate at which patients were referred to these facilities, not whether patients were harmed or had complaints. Indeed, patients didn\u2019t seem to be complaining much at all.\nThe people who did bellow were the ones competing against physician-owned laboratories and imaging services. The American Clinical Laboratory Association, the American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science, and the American Society of Clinical Pathologists supported Stark\u2019s efforts. It was a case of established businesses using government to drive out the upstart competition.\nStark Changes\nThere were surely other ways of dealing with physician self-referral than banning physician ownership of laboratories and imaging centers. Requiring physicians to disclose their ownership interest to patients and giving Medicare and Medicaid patients a financial incentive to think twice about whether they needed a particular test would have been worth a try.\nBut that wouldn\u2019t have pleased the groups representing non-physician-owned services since the physician-owned competition would still be in the marketplace. Further, it would have been unacceptable to a politician like Stark who is so much better suited to make decisions about health care than sniveling patients and greedy physicians. So, backed by industry groups, he succeeded in passing what became known as the \u201cStark Laws.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The first part, passed in 1989, banned Medicare from paying for any laboratory services that were the result of physician self-referral. The second part, passed in 1993, extended the ban to other types of services, including imaging and radiology services, physical therapy services, and durable medical equipment and supplies. It also applied the ban to the other major federal health care program, Medicaid.\nThe passage of the Stark laws didn\u2019t mean that physicians stopped being independent-minded or entrepreneurial. The new restrictions only meant that laboratories and imaging centers became less attractive options for their efforts. Instead, physicians began focusing on PSHs because of a loophole in the Stark Laws known as the \u201cwhole hospital exception.\u201d This loophole allowed physicians who were part owners of a whole hospital to self-refer Medicare patients to that hospital. The theory behind this exception was that since hospitals were usually so big, the ownership share that any physician was likely to have would be tiny. With a tiny ownership share, \u201cthe financial incentive to self-refer would be insignificant.\u201d (David Schactman in Health Affairs, May/June 2005) As Charles Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, would later complain, \u201cToday\u2019s physician-owned model was virtually unknown then. Lawmakers could not anticipate that this exception would spur the proliferation of [PSHs.]\u201d\nThe first time that general hospitals actively tried to quash PSHs occurred in Ohio in 1997. Two years earlier, the state legislature had begun undoing the \u201ccertificate-of-need\u201d law, a law that requires a hospital to get the approval of state authorities before it can open its doors. Without the certificate-of-need law, it was much easier to start a PSH in Ohio. By 1997, cardiac surgeons in Dayton were partnering with MedCath, a company that specialized in developing PSHs, to open the Dayton Heart Hospital. This caused great consternation among the general hospital community. Paul Lee, a hospital lobbyist in the state capitol of Columbus said that PSHs threatened \u201cthe viability of our not-for profit health care system in Ohio. Almost every hospital, and I\u2019ve talked to dozens, is concerned about this issue.\u201d (Crain\u2019s Cleveland Business, December 1997)\nBy late 1997, the Ohio Hospital Association (OHA), which represented over 180 general hospitals, was calling on the state legislature to impose a two-year moratorium on new hospital construction in the state. But the OHA faced opposition from both the Ohio Medical Association, which represented Ohio physicians, and health insurance companies. The insurance companies saw physician-owned specialty hospitals as a way to lower the price that they paid for health care. Furthermore, the state legislature seemed to be in no mood to revisit the issue of the certificate-of-need law, having worked to repeal it just two years earlier. This time, the general hospitals were unsuccessful in shutting down the competition.\nDavid vs. Goliath\nThis was only the opening skirmish in long war that would soon play out on the national stage. The organizations representing general hospitals would spend vast sums over the better part of decade on research, public relations, and lobbying with the goal of shutting down PSHs. There were many times when they appeared on the verge of delivering a crushing defeat, only to see the groups representing PSHs narrowly escape.\nUnfortunately, a relatively small group like PSHs can seldom resist an immensely powerful political force. General hospitals finally succeeded in landing what may have been the fatal blow against PSHs on March 21, 2010 when ObamaCare became law.\nIn retrospect, it\u2019s amazing that PSHs successfully resisted as long as they did. After all, the Americ\nan Hospital Association and Federation of American Hospitals are behemoths. According to the website Opensecrets.org, the Federation of American Hospitals spent about $23.6 million on lobbying Congress and almost $1.6 million on campaign contributions from 2001-2010. During that same period, the American Hospital Association spent just over $159 million lobbying Congress and $8 million on campaign contributions. By comparison, the lobbying organization for PSHs, Physician Hospitals of America, spent $1.8 million on lobbying and $851,9000 on campaign contributions. MedCath spent $2.7 million and $149,134, respectively, on those items. In money terms, the organizations fighting for PSHs were outgunned.\nThe American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals\u2019 biggest source of power is the number of potential voters they represent. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, general hospitals employ over 5.6 million people in the U.S., an average of nearly 112,000 voters per state and 12,800 per Congressional district. When the Big Hospital Lobby speaks, senators and representatives usually listen.\nIn 2000 Rep. Stark was already signaling that he was eager to fight on behalf of the Big Hospital Lobby. In July, he sent a letter to the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services asking for an investigation of some of the PSHs that were owned by MedCath. The following year he partnered with Representative Jerry Kleczka (D-WI) [at left] in authoring a bill that would put limits on PSHs. The House of Representatives, though, was controlled by Republicans and Stark was a Democrat. \u201cThis is going to be a delicate political strategy,\u201d he said of getting his bill passed into law. \u201cMy chances as a member of the minority are very slim unless the American Hospital Association takes it on as its cause.\u201d\nIn 2002 the American Hospital Association put together a task force on PSHs after hearing complaints from many of their members around the country. The policy director at the American Hospital Association, Ellen Pryga, complained, \u201cThis is not a level playing field for hospitals.\u201d\nShe had a point. Nearly all general hospitals have emergency rooms, and under federal law hospitals with emergency rooms must treat all patients regardless of ability to pay. That means those hospitals must treat patients who are either indigent or are on Medicaid and, because of Medicaid\u2019s low reimbursement rates, can\u2019t find physicians elsewhere to treat them. Many PSHs did not have emergency rooms and so did not have to treat such patients.\nAs long as general hospitals had to take indigent and Medicare patients, perhaps it was only fair that PSHs be required to take some of those patients as well. But the Big Hospital Lobby wasn\u2019t interested in creating a more level playing field. Rather, it wanted to drive the competition completely out of the game.\nThis became evident when the American Hospital Association task force issued its recommendations in late 2002. Chief among them was a proposal to change the Stark Laws so that physicians could no longer use the \u201cwhole hospital exception.\u201d That would effectively prevent physicians from referring patients to hospitals they owned making it next to impossible for physicians to own hospitals.\nThe first major blow to physician-owned specialty hospitals came in November 2003 when Congress completed work on the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. During the negotiations over the bill, Sen. John Breaux (D-LA) inserted an amendment that would have prevented physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to hospitals that they owned. Both the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals lobbied hard for the amendment. The American Hospital Association flew 100 hospital administrators to Washington to meet with members of Congress and spent $100,000 on advertising. Reportedly, at one point the American Hospital Association threatened to withhold its endorsement of the bill if the amendment was not included.\nIn the end, Physician Hospitals of America and other groups lobbying on behalf of PSHs got lucky. They had a key ally in another Louisiana politician, Rep. W.J. \u201cBilly\u201d Tauzin (R-LA), who was chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Its members played a large role in drafting the Medicare Prescription Drug Act. Tauzin, who believed that the increased competition from physician-owned specialty hospitals was good for the health care system, managed to negotiate a compromise with Breaux. Beginning in 2004, physicians were forbidden from making new investments in PSHs for 18 months while the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) studied the effect of PHSs on general hospitals. (Senators Grassley (R-IA) and Max Baucus (D-MT) would win another six month moratorium in 2006 while CMS developed a plan for dealing with PSHs.)\nThe Big Hospital Lobby \u201chides behind their community mission\u201d in order to \u201cstifle competition.\"\nYet it seemed analogous to studying the effect a few drops of water would have on the Great Lakes. In 2003, there were over 4,800 general hospitals in the U.S. There were barely 100 specialty hospitals with another 26 under development, and of those, only about 70% were owned by physicians. Furthermore, 22 states had no PSHs, and another 18 had no more than two. The threat that PSHs posed to general hospitals seemed puny.\nSo what had the Big Hospital Lobby so worried? Why was making the destruction of PSHs such a priority? After all the noise that the Big Hospital Lobby had made about the issue, most general hospitals were aware of potential competition from PSHs\u2014and if they weren\u2019t, undoubtedly the American Hospital Association and Federation of American Hospitals could alert them. Being forewarned, surely general hospitals could prepare for new competition and find new strategies for dealing with it.\nCouldn\u2019t they?\nUnfortunately, general hospitals are rife with inefficiency. Consider:\nOne academic study measured the efficiency of transferring patients between different units of a hospital by examining how the process was affected by administrative delays, unavailable beds, unavailable staff, the readiness of units to receive patients and breakdowns in communication. The process was over 87% inefficient. (Nursing Economics, July-August 2005 pp. 157-164)\nAn article in Health Services Research found that hospital \u201coutputs\u201d\u2014patient admissions, outpatient visits, surgeries, and births\u2014could be increased 26% by eliminating inefficiency. (October 2008, Vol. 43, No. 5, Part II, pp. 1830-1848)\nDifferent hospital departments often do not relay information effectively to each other. One study in the Journal of Healthcare Management suggests that hospitals waste $12 billion annually on inefficient communication. (July-August 2010, Vol. 55, No. 4, pp. 419-431)\nA study examining \u201chospitalists\u201d\u2014physicians who focus solely on the management of hospital inpatients\u2014found that hospitals that employ them could reduce the average patient length of stay by about 37% and average per admission costs by almost 24%. (Health Services Research, June 2003, Vol. 38, No. 3, pp. 905-918)\nInefficiency affects patient mortality. An article in Health Economics found that a one-percentage point reduction in a hospital\u2019s cost inefficiency was associated with one fewer death per 10,000 patient discharges.(2006, Vol. 15, No. 4, pp. 419-431)\nWith general hospitals rife with inefficiency, it\u2019s not hard to see why they found PSHs so threatening. In the long run, plodding dinosaurs would be hard-pressed against smaller, quicker competitors. To survive, general hospitals would have to do more than merely adapt; they would have to endure an upheaval, drastically changing the way they operated. Better to stop the competition before it proliferated.\nFriends in High Places\nThe hospital industry had already been through big changes during the decade of the 1990s. Financial pressures resulted in a wave of hospital mergers and consolidations. Hospital markets became more concentrated with more hospitals being owned by fewer companies. This resulted in the number of hospitals beds nationwide being reduced 72,000 between 1989-1999. (Hospital Statistics, 2001, Chicago: American Hospital Association.)\nBy having more market power, hospitals benefited by having stronger negotiating power with insurance companies. The prices hospitals charged increased, as prices often do when there is less competition. One study found that every 10% increase in market concentration among hospitals resulted in a 6.6% increase in hospital prices. (Cory Capps and David Dranove, \u201cHospital Consolidation And Negotiated PPO Prices,\u201d Health Affairs, March/April 2004, Vol. 23, No. 2, pp. 175-181.)\nBy contrast, more competition results in lower prices, something that the people running general hospitals would be less than eager to embrace. And that\u2019s exactly what they would get if PSHs prolif\nerated. That prospect must have been alarming for the Big Hospital Lobby.\nBut it needn\u2019t have been worried. Its actions during the Medicare Prescription Drug Act had attracted the attention of Senators Grassley, a Republican, and Max Baucus, a Democrat (pictured at right). Both would soon become allies of the Big Hospital Lobby. Since both men were their parties' top senators on the Finance Committee, which has sole jurisdiction over Medicare in the Senate, the Big Hospital Lobby was assured that the chair of that powerful committee would be a friend for the foreseeable future.\nThe Big Hospital Lobby probably couldn\u2019t have asked for better allies on the Finance Committee. Neither Grassley\u2019s state of Iowa nor Baucus\u2019 Montana had any physician-owned specialty hospitals. So, the only voting hospital workers in Iowa or Montana that Grassley or Baucus would ever hear from would be those who worked for general hospitals.\nIn 2005, Grassley and Baucus introduced the Hospital Fair Competition Act. It would have closed the whole hospital exception. The \u201cbill would level the playing field between specialty hospitals and community hospitals by eliminating incentives in the payment system to cherry-pick the healthiest and most profitable patients,\u201d the senators wrote in a letter urging their colleagues to support the bill. Although the bill never became law, Grassley and Baucus were clearly singing the Big Hospital Lobby\u2019s tune.\nWithin a period of fourteen months, Grassley and Baucus scheduled two hearings before the Finance Committee on physician-owned specialty hospitals (PSHs). One of the subjects of the second hearing was an 88-year-old woman who had entered Physicians\u2019 Hospital in Portland, a PSH, and died shortly after having back surgery. Physicians\u2019 Hospital apparently did not have a physician on site during her crisis and had to call 911 for assistance. Grassley and Baucus had learned of this case a few months before the hearing and it prompted them to send a letter to the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services requesting an investigation into the emergency procedures of PSHs. (A few months later, a similar case would occur at a PSH in West Texas.)\nWhen the Office of the Inspector General released its report on PSHs emergency procedures in January 2008, Baucus and Grassley again sounded the alarm. \u201cSpecialty hospitals need to do a better job fulfilling the public expectations, and they most certainly need to do a better job protecting the safety of their patients,\u201d said Baucus. Grassley warned, \u201cThis new report documents the significant and potentially life-threatening shortcomings of physician-owned specialty hospitals when it comes to emergency services.\u201d But did it?\nThe report found that 55% of PSHs had an emergency department. Its most troubling finding was that about 7% were in violation of the Medicare regulations that a hospital have a nurse on site and a physician on call at all times. However, one thing was curiously absent from the report: any other deaths like the ones in Oregon and West Texas. Perhaps Grassley called the emergency services of PSHs \u201cpotentially life-threatening\u201d because they had yet to live up to that \"potential.\"\nMany PSHs challenged the Inspector General report. The ones the report claimed were in violation of Medicare staffing regulations came \u201cforward with documentation showing that they were properly staffed . . . during the times in question.\u201d A spokesman for the Office of the Inspector General said that it stood by its report. The discrepancies were never resolved.\nThe Big Hospital Lobby heralded the report. \u201cThe report illustrates yet another reason why Congress needs to take action in the best interests of patients and ban physician self-referral to new limited-service hospitals they own and operate,\u201d said American Hospital Association president Rick Pollack.\nCherry Picking and Avoiding Medicaid Patients?\nOne of the most serious criticisms of PSHs is that they \u201ccherry pick\u201d the most profitable patients and steer the less profitable ones to general hospitals. In its broadside against PSHs called \u201cSelf-Referral to Physician-owned Hospitals: What the Research Says,\u201d the American Hospital Association points to two types of evidence to support this criticism.\nThe first is that PSHs treat fewer patients on Medicaid, the government health care program for the poor. Medicaid is notorious for having low reimbursement rates, and physicians with a single-minded focus on profits would want to avoid Medicaid patients. Evidence from two Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) reports and a GAO report shows that PSHs do treat fewer Medicaid patients when compared to general hospitals. It would seem that PSHs eschew Medicaid patients\u2014but it only seems that way.\nMedicaid patients do not need heart or orthopedic surgery in the same numbers that older patients do. Rather, Medicaid patients are often young, poor women who are pregnant and in need of obstetric services offered by general hospitals. PSHs don\u2019t treat as many Medicaid patients because they specialize in services that Medicaid patients tend not to use.\nIs physician ownership of a hospital a conflict of interest?\nTo be fair, it isn\u2019t the specialization of PSHs that fully accounts for their lower rate of Medicaid patients. Both MedPAC and the GAO compared PSHs with \u201cpeer\u201d hospitals that specialized in similar treatment areas and did find that PSHs treated lower rate of Medicaid patients, although the differences weren\u2019t huge. MedPAC found that Medicaid patients accounted for 5% of revenues at physician-owned surgical and orthopedic hospitals and for 9% at the peer hospitals. For physician-owned cardiac hospitals, MedPAC found that Medicaid accounted for 3% of their patients and for 7% of peer hospitals. The numbers were similar in the GAO study, 3% versus 6%. Neither MedPAC nor the GAO stated explicitly that cherry picking caused the difference. MedPAC could only speculate that \u201cspecialty hospital decisions such as location, mission, emergency room capability, and physician financial incentives to avoid Medicaid patients may have contributed to the lower Medicaid shares at physician-owned hospitals.\u201d\nThe second type of evidence used to support the claim of cherry picking is the illness severity of the patient. Critics maintain that PSHs admit fewer patients with multiple illnesses or, as the medical literature puts it, \u201ccomorbidities,\u201d since such patients are more costly to treat. For example, critics charge that a physician-owned cardiac hospital will treat patients with coronary artery disease, but will try to refer patients that have not only coronary artery disease but also diabetes and hypertension to a general hospital.\nYet the evidence is in fact mixed. For example, in one report, MedPAC found that, on average, PSHs did treat more \u201clow-severity\u201d patients than did general hospitals. But in a later report MedPAC researchers looked for \u201can increase in the ratio of highly profitable surgeries to less profitable surgeries\u201d in markets with PSHs on the assumption that such an increase \u201cwould indicate that financial incentives may have influenced at least some physicians\u2019 behavior.\u201d The report concluded that if \u201cspecialty hospitals are inducing market-wide shift in the ratio of low-severity to high-severity patients, the magnitude of the shift is too small to be detected with our test of statistical significance.\u201d\nLikewise, a CMS study yielded mixed results. When examining physician referral patterns it found that in some instances physician-owners referred more of their high-severity patients to their hospitals than did non-owners, but in other cases the non-owners referred more high-severity cases to the physician-owned specialty hospital. It also studied patients being transferred to and from PSHs and admitted to PSHs and general hospitals via emergency departments. In neither of those areas did CMS find a pattern of PSHs treating low-severity patients at an unusual rate versus the rate found in general hospitals. A Lewin Group study financed by MedCath found that PSHs treated a higher rate of high-severity patients.\nFinally, both the CMS study and a study in Health Affairs compared the referral rates of physician owners with those of non-owner physicians who had admitting privileges to the PSHs. If financial incentives were driving cherry picking, then presumably physician owners would refer higher-severity patients to PSHs at a lower rate than non-owner physicians. The results showed no clear pattern. In some cases physician owners referred more high-severity patients to their PSHs than did non-owners, while in other cases the non-owners referred more high-severity patients to PSHs.\nThe reason the results on cherry picking are so inconclusive may be that physicians are actually referring their patients to the hospitals best suited to care for them. Studies suggest that general hospitals may be better suited to handle more complex patients. A physician-owned cardiac hospital will have the specialists to treat a patient with heart disease. But if that patient also has hypertension and diabetes, the general hospital will also have the specialists necessary to deal with complications that might arise from those comorbidities.\nFurther, PSHs may improve their ability to treat high-severity patients as time passes and physicians and nurses gain more experience. The Dayton Heart Hospital is a PSH that is partly owned by MedCath. Commenting on Dayton\u2019s ability to treat many high-severity patients, CMS noted that because \u201cDayton Heart Hospital is the second oldest MedCath facility, it may be that, as a specialty facility matures, its service range and ability to treat more severe cases may expand.\u201d\nConflict Of Interest?\nCritics of PSHs charge that what is best for physician owners and what is best for their patients creates a conflict of interest. Even physicians disagree over this.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think doctors should own hospitals. Period,\u201d says. Dr. James Sisk, who practices internal medicine in Oklahoma City. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s a conflict of interest.\u201d Dr. Sisk worries that physicians are increasingly unable to make a living at what they should be doing, such as evaluating and managing the patient. He thinks that is why they increasingly turn to endeavors like owning hospitals. His concern, like that of many critics of PSHs, is that since physician owners share in the profit generated from surgeries, they have an incentive to perform surgery even when the patient may not really need it. \u201cPeople are going to get surgery they don\u2019t need,\u201d he says.\nBut do physician owners face a financial incentive to refer patients for surgery that is greater than any other physician faces?\n\u201cEven the decision to do surgery, I make money off of that. Any surgery, anywhere, I get a fee for that whether I\u2019m an owner or not,\u201d counters Dr. David Holden of McBride Orthopedic Hospital, a physician-owned specialty hospital. \u201cI could do unnecessary surgery from day one, if I was that type of person. Just scheduling surgery in the first place is a potential conflict of interest since I get paid for that.\u201d\nWhen a patient goes into the hospital for surgery, Medicare pays for a number of different services. First, Medicare Part A pays the hospital a fee to cover the costs associated with providing the operating room, nurses, etc. Then, Medicare Part B pays the physician a separate fee for performing the surgery. Since Medicare Part B pays every surgeon each time he or she performs a surgery, every surgeon has a potential conflict of interest. Thus, critics are wrong to argue that physician-owned hospitals create a conflict of interest between the physician and patient.\nAt worst, PSHs increase that conflict of interest, but by how much? One researcher points out that if a surgeon performs a bypass surgery, Medicare Part B pays him about $3,622. The hospital gets paid a much larger fee, and the profit on that fee might be as much as $12,000. A physician-owner will get a portion of that profit. However, since the average physician owner has about a 2% ownership share, the average physician owner \u201cwould only receive $240 in pre-tax profits, still a fraction of the $3,622 surgeon\u2019s fee.\u201d (Texas Public Policy Foundation, Center for Health Care Policy, May 2008)\nIt is the patient who should decide what type of hospital he or she should use since it is the patient who will be paying the personal cost if the decision is the wrong one.\nCritics like the American Hospital Association might point to the research supposedly showing that PSHs increase the utilization of surgery as indirect proof that conflict of the interest is greater with physician owners. Yet the research doesn\u2019t quite say what the American Hospital Association says it does.\nFor example, in \u201cSelf-Referral to Physician-owned Hospitals: What the Research Says,\u201d the American Hospital Association claims that the MedPAC studies found that PSHs \u201cincrease utilization\u201d of surgery. That\u2019s misleading. The first MedPAC study found no significant difference in utilization between PSHs and general hospitals. The second MedPAC report did find that areas with cardiac PSHs saw an increase in surgeries, but not areas with orthopedic or surgical PHSs. Other research also yields mixed results. Two recent articles by Jean Mitchell did find an increase in utilization due to PSHs. (Medical Care Research Review, August 2007, and Archives of Surgery, August 2010) But an article in Health Affairs (Jan/Feb 2006) and another in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (June 2005) found no such increase.\nInconclusive research on utilization, though, hardly means that physicians who invest in hospitals are not motivated by money. Of course they are. Few people endure four years of medical school followed by a grueling residency to live the rest of their lives as monks. Nor would they invest substantial sums of money in a PSH without the hope of achieving long-term monetary reward.\nYet, if physicians were motivated primarily by money, there are more profitable careers, like ones on Wall Street or K Street, they could have pursued. Similarly, there are investments other than PSHs that are potentially more profitable. Like most people, physicians have multiple motivations for what they do, money being just one.\nOne of biggest motivations that drives people to become physicians is a desire to treat patients. That motivation plays a large role in physicians\u2019 decisions to become owners of specialty hospitals. A Health Affairs article found that controlling the work environment, increasing efficiency, and improving quality were key reasons why physicians owned hospitals. MedPAC found that \u201cthe cardiologists and surgeons want to admit their patients, perform their procedures, and have their patients recover with minimal disruption. Physician control, they believe, makes this possible in ways community hospitals cannot match.\u201d Physician-owners believed that being owners gave them more control over operating room schedules and staff and helped them avoid down time between surgeries.\nFurthermore, a good physician should be able to make money by providing good care to his patients. Dr. Thomas Janssen said that while money was an issue when he and the eighteen other physicians decided to start McBride Hospital, it was more than just a matter of boosting their incomes.\n\u201cIt was a factor,\u201d he says. \u201cWe feel the success of this hospital is very dependent on the work we do here. We felt like there was a large amount of money being generated by our business and that we would much rather have control over that whether it\u2019s in the form of investing it back in the hospital or back in ourselves.\u201d\nObamaCare: Stifling Competition\nFrom late 2007 to early 2009, the Big Hospital Lobby lost three more fights to stifle the competition\u2014two efforts at reauthorizing the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and the passage of a \u201cWar Supplemental\u201d\u2014additional spending Congress needed to authorize for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Each contained some type of restriction on PSHs. But in none of those instances was the Big Hospital Lobby\u2019s support crucial to getting those bills passed. When some PSH supporters in Congress objected, the provisions limiting PSHs were jettisoned.\n\u201cWe are working at capacity, and if we want to add to capacity, [ObamaCare]\u00a0 pretty much precludes that.\u201d\n-Dr. Hooman Sedighi\nBut to pass ObamaCare, President Obama and Congressional Democrats would need most of the key health care players on board\u2014physicians, nurses, pharmaceutical makers, medical equipment companies, the insurance industry, and, especially, hospitals. Without the support of groups like the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals, passing ObamaCare would have been next to impossible, especially since funding some of the insurance subsidies in ObamaCare would require cuts in the hospital portion of Medicare. The American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals were not going to go along with that unless they got something in return, and that meant restrictions on PSHs.\nAfter what was a long and arduous battle, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law in March, 2010. Under the new law, CMS could not grant any more Medicare provider numbers to PSHs after December 31, 2010. So, if a PSH hadn\u2019t been constructed and gone through its inspection by that date, it would not be able to accept Medicare patients. That all but guarantees that no new physician-owned specialty hospitals will be built.\nAccording to Physician Hospitals of America, 30 PSHs under construction were able to meet the December deadline while 44 did not. Physicians who invested in the hospitals that did not meet the deadline will likely have to sell their shares.\nFor those PSHs already in existence, the law created a series of bureaucratic hoops to jump through that makes expansion difficult. To expand a PSH, the owners must apply to the Department of Health and Human Services. They can do so only once every two years. They must then wait while members of the community provide input. Further, the PSH must be in a county where population growth is 150% of the population growth of the state in the last five years. Inpatient admissions to the PSH must be equal to or greater than the average of such admissions in all hospitals located in the county. The PSH\u2019s bed occupancy rate must be greater than the state average. And it must be located in a state where hospital bed capacity is less than the national average. Once a PSH meets all of those conditions, it is prohibited from expanding more than 200%.\nThose regulations mean that a PSH will expand in only the rarest of circumstances, and they apply even to expansions that were in progress when the law passed. It is not known how much money was lost due to expansions that were halted.\nPhysicians and other investors at the Indiana Orthopedic Hospital came close to losing $27 million invested in a new building housing three operating rooms. The building was only three-quarters of the way finished. \u201cWe spent a great deal of time looking at how to restructure it so we could stay within the law,\u201d said Dr. John Dietz, an orthopedic surgeon and part owner. \u201cWe decided to create a new company through which we could own that building as an ambulatory surgery center.\u201d The law does not apply to ambulatory surgery centers. (Video below:\u00a0Dr. Dietz interviewed in December 2011)\nThe Global Rehab and Pine Creek Medical Center in Dallas had to cancel plans for an expansion and for a new 66-bed hospital in Ahwatukee, Arizona. But the physicians there were lucky\u2014not more than $230,000 was lost on either of those since neither was beyond the planning stages. However a physician at the Center, Dr. Hooman Sedighi, said, \u201cWe are working at capacity, and if we want to add to capacity, this bill pretty much precludes that. The other thing is the potential job loss \u2014 the ones that are under construction or expanding, they would have been hiring additional staff and personnel.\u201d\nPoliticians and interest groups ended up deciding what was best for patients.\nThe Big Hospital Lobby wasn\u2019t too sympathetic. \u201cThey\u2019ve known that this was in the Senate and House bill, and if they went into new construction they knew that they were taking a risk,\u201d the American Hospital Association\u2019s Pryga said.\nInitially McBride Orthopedic Hospital was set to lose $167,000 that it had spent to initiate an expansion. (They are currently operating at 85%\u00a0capacity.)\u00a0 But CEO Mark Galliart (pictured below) eventually found an interpretation of the new regulations that enabled McBride to go ahead with its project to build three new operating rooms. CMS wouldn\u2019t permit a PSH to expand its number of beds under ObamaCare, but it did not put restrictions on how those beds were allocated. Galliart simply scuttled three acute-care beds and in their place will put the operating tables that will go in the three new operating rooms.\nIn an interview with The New Individualist Galliart pointed out that there may be an irony in the regulations for the Big Hospital Lobby.\nOne of the reasons they wanted this moratorium on growth for physician-owned hospitals was because the doctors [allegedly] cherry picked. Well, what do you think the doctors are going to do now that they can\u2019t grow? Now they\u2019ve pushed us to take the more profitable cases because we can\u2019t grow. The only way we can continue to stay afloat is to do the more profitable cases . . . It just cracks me up. Now the hospitals are going to get what they said they didn\u2019t want.\nWorse, the new restrictions all but end a major source of innovation in the health care system. In other industries, as workers gain experience they often gain insight into how the industry can be improved. They come up with ideas about how to provide customers with better products and services at lower prices. Becoming an owner of a company gives them the opportunity to put those ideas into practice. So, for example, Henry Ford worked as an engineer at Westinghouse, which built steam engines, before staring the Ford Motor Company; Sam Walton worked at J.C. Penney long before he opened Wal-Mart; and Steve Jobs was an employee at Hewlett-Packard and Atari before he founded Apple Computers, just to name a few.\nLikewise, as physicians gain experience in a hospital, they come up with ideas about how to create more effective patient care. That was a big motivation among the physicians who began McBride Orthopedic Hospital. It would have been difficult, if not impossible, for them to put their ideas into practice without becoming owners. The Stark Laws began the process of stifling that sort of innovation in health care and ObamaCare may have killed it entirely. Rep. Stark doesn\u2019t think that matters. \u201cThese doctors are not entrepreneurs. They\u2019re getting a kickback from referring patients. They make enough money,\u201d he said. And, surely, he would know.\nThe Big Hospital Lobby claimed that it only wanted what was in the interest of the common good. \u201cEliminating physician self-referral will benefit both patients and communities,\u201d said the American Hospital Association\u2019s Matt Fenwick as ObamaCare neared passage. \u201c[I]t saves taxpayers money, ends a serious conflict of interest and, above all, allows full-service community hospitals to provide vital care for all those in need.\u201d\nYet with the exception of a few articles of research, the desires of patients were largely absent from the discussion. While that research did suggest that PSHs treat patients better, no one ever conducted an extensive examination into the issue. Most of the research examined how PSHs affected general hospitals. As is often the case when medicine meets politics, it was politicians and interest groups who ended up deciding what was best for patients.\n\u201cThe physicians are the ones who decide where their patients go, not the patients,\u201d said the American Hospital Association\u2019s Pryga. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of the patient\u2019s choice, it\u2019s a matter of the physician\u2019s choice.\u201d\nResearch suggests that isn\u2019t true. As CMS found in its study, physician owners \u201care constrained in where they refer patients by several factors\u201d including \u201cpatient preference.\u201d Indeed, the prospect of being hospitalized is when patients are most likely to challenge their physicians by requesting a second opinion.\nUltimately, it is the patient who should decide what type of hospital he or she should use since it is the patient who will be paying the personal cost if the decision is the wrong one. The patient is the one who will endure an unpleasant recovery in the hospital, experience pain if there are surgical complications, suffer a readmission after being discharged, or, ultimately, die. Politicians, the Big Hospital Lobby, physicians, hospital administrators\u2014none of them pay those costs. It is the patient who has the best incentive to make the right decision as to whether a PSH, or a general hospital, or some other surgical facility is the best place to have surgery.\nUnfortunately, powerful political interests use Medicare in ways that limit the ability of patients to make the health care choices that best suit them. And that\u2019s an Rx for an enduring and growing health care crisis.\n"}, {"score": 861.91504, "uuid": "0481ef25-fdc7-5623-aa63-f8fdb6917902", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0815wb-88-13495", "target_hostname": "www.ntu.org", "target_uri": "http://www.ntu.org/governmentbytes/medicaremedicaid/", "page_rank": 1.6000172e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "National Taxpayers Union - <em>Medicare</em> and Medicaid", "snippet": "It sounds a bit naive I know, but isn&#x27;t that <em>better</em> <em>than</em> having to keep correcting the goofs in post?", "explanation": null, "document": "NTU Campaign Warning About Medicare Part D Rebate Scheme Draws Ire, Misinformation, from Partisan Interests\nPosted By: Douglas Kellogg - December\u00a01,\u00a02011\nIt looks like a tax, smells like a tax, walks like a tax, but unfortunately Austin-American Statesman\u2019s \u201cPolitiFact\u201d felt the need to reach an unfair opinion on an NTU-sponsored ad warning of a new Medicare Part D \u201crebate\u201d scheme that was little more than a tax in disguise. Now, it seems local Democratic Party activists are actively using PolitiFact\u2019s article, and some dubious assumptions and claims about NTU, in an effort to mislead their neighbors on the negative impact the Medicare Part D rebate tax would have.\nFirst of all, key facts were left unmentioned in the PolitiFact piece. For example, the fact that the rebate program fits with the Joint Committee on Taxation\u2019s definition of an excise tax, or that NTU provided PolitiFact with numerous references either describing the measure as a tax or demonstrating its economic harm. Convoluted policy workings of Washington bureaucrats may make reality hard to decipher: the bottom line is that no matter what you call it, a mandatory 23 percent burden is the price that real, live people will pay in many ways.\nNow, Letters to the Editor are popping up in local papers, written primarily by Democratic activists. These letters range from simply relying on PolitiFact\u2019s verdict, to incoherent rambling and strange conspiracy theories. However, some of the accusations must be cleared up: NTU has no coordination with any candidates, nor do these issue-focused advertisements imply any endorsement of individuals. Any wild claims about \u201cfront groups\u201d are just that, and designed to distract from the details of the issue at hand.\nSeveral months before the ad ran, NTU cautioned that a Part D \u201crebate\u201d plan was among several \u201c disastrous debt ideas \u201d bouncing around the Supercommittee. Members of Congress had advocated this debacle before, and President Obama included a version of it in his own Supercommittee recommendations. So we felt compelled to sound the alarm in a Dallas Morning News ad and make certain citizens kept encouraging lawmakers who might be opposed to the plan.\nBut even though PolitiFact gave some space to NTU's case for calling this proposal a tax, and seemed to concede some of the other points we made, the staff nonetheless branded our ad \u201cfalse,\u201d claiming \u201cObama's urged rebate remains that--money paid in return for a purchase or action/opportunity. One would have to connect more dots to make it a tax.\u201d Well, here are some of the many dots NTU connected that deserved more mention in the piece.\nPolitiFact\u2019s central claim: \u201cOutside experts said they\u2019d never heard the Medicaid rebates -- or proposed Medicare rebates -- referred to as taxes.\u201d\nYet NTU provided plenty of such references: Joseph Antos of the American Enterprise Institute who served on the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission, Guy King, former Chief Actuary for Medicare and Medicaid, former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin , and Grace Marie-Turner of the Galen Institute. Antos, for example, noted that, \u201cThe so-called rebate isn\u2019t a rebate at all. For a large number of Part D patients, it\u2019s going to function as a tax.\u201d Holtz-Eakin, along with Michael Ramlet, wrote, \u201cIn the end, not only will the cost of a new government rebate, like any tax, be borne somewhere else in the economy, but \u2026 seniors will also be forced to pay much higher premiums for their prescription drug plans.\u201d\nPolitiFact duly reported our contention that the \"rebate\" is based on a percentage of price-per-unit, a lot like the way some excise taxes on products such as certain tobacco items work. But here's the rest of the story. Calling the proposal \"money paid in return for a purchase or action/opportunity,\" as PolitiFact does, is an inadequate explanation. That's because the rebate is levied on an ad valorem basis, not in exchange for a service. This is an important consideration: the \"rebate\" is on the sale of a specific product, using a specified value of the product. That is the basic definition of how an excise tax works. In fact the Joint Committee on Taxation describes an excise as such: \"taxes imposed on a per unit or ad valorem (i.e., percentage of price) basis on the production, importation, or sale of a specific good or service.\u201d\nBut aren\u2019t taxes mandatory when this rebate isn\u2019t? Not when Washington rigs the rules. As we told PolitiFact, federal and state government programs are capturing an increasingly dominant share of the prescription drug market (about 30 percent for Medicare and Medicaid, more when VA and government employee programs are added in). This has been especially true since the creation of the Medicare Part D benefit. It's one reason why we opposed the Part D program in the first place. For Congress and the White House to legislate more influence over drug-purchasing in the United States, and then say, \"well, if you won't pay our latest kickback demands you can't sell in the empire we've created\" is coercive.\nTransparent political mud-slinging is unfortunate, but predictable when an organization seeks to shine the light of truth on a destructive policy that has been cleverly buried in a complex bureaucracy to prevent citizens from realizing that they are about to be hit with an unfair new burden. When the people implementing this destructive change are the types who profit politically by touting their uncompromising stewardship of the program, unseemly political tactics are unavoidable.\nThroughout NTU's 40-plus year existence, one central part of our mission has been calling politicians to account when they create a plan that works and hurts like a tax, but refuse to call it a tax. Our effort against the 23 percent rebate is certainly not the last time we\u2019ll be fulfilling that mission.\n"}, {"score": 861.81586, "uuid": "8b8b9ae8-7981-5731-a8ed-526f5fc4fd9d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1802wb-79-27945", "target_hostname": "healthcarereform.procon.org", "target_uri": "http://healthcarereform.procon.org/news.archive.php", "page_rank": 2.2284001e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Health Care Reform &#x2F; &quot;<em>Obamacare</em>&quot; ProCon.org Notices Archive", "snippet": "- This website <em>is</em> our first ever site meaning it took us less <em>than</em> 35 hours to build.

Because the taxing power is the strongest constitutional basis for upholding ObamaCare. 1) If the Court finds the mandate is a tax, it will likely uphold ObamaCare. 2) Finding that the mandate is a tax for purposes of the Tax Anti-Injunction Act would signal that the Court thinks it is indeed a tax, in which case ... see point 1. And yet, because of how the Tax Anti-Injunction Act works, the Court would not be able to render a final judgment until several years from now, thereby denying voters a critical piece of information: What does the Supreme Court think about ObamaCare's constitutionality?\nThe historically lengthy oral arguments in the case, HHS v. Florida -- now expanded by thirty minutes to an unprecedented six hours --\u00a0are slated to take place in late March. A formal ruling in the case is expected by early July.\u00a0But will it be the final ruling? That's now less clear.\nTo fully understand this development, one needs to understand the Tax Anti-Injunction Act.\nFirst enacted in 1867, the Act sweepingly forbids any court from hearing any case in which any person attempts to prevent the assessment or collection of a tax. Once a tax has been assessed and collected, however, a court may hear a case on it.\nThe question in this case is: Is the health mandate penalty a tax, or not?\nThe ObamaCare mandate is enforced by means of a penalty, collected by the IRS. Congress placed the penalty language in the Internal Revenue Code. With some exceptions, beginning in tax year 2014, it will be imposed on every citizen who doesn't check a box on his annual IRS tax return affirming that he has purchased government-controlled health insurance.\nBut despite all of that, it's still unclear whether the penalty is a tax. Why? Because past Court rulings have said that it's only a \"tax\" if its primary effect is to \"raise a revenue.\" If it's primary effect is to coerce, it's a mandate masquerading as a tax. The health care mandate's primary effect is to make people buy health coverage, not to raise a revenue. It raises very little revenue, in fact.\nSo far, lower federal courts have come down on both sides of this issue. And for complicated legal and political reasons, the Obama Administration has actually been taking boths sides on it : In Congress, the President's men say it's not a tax; in court, they say it is one.\nIf the high Court were to decide the mandate is a tax for purposes of the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, it would ensure that President Obama, who\u00a0faces reelection in November, doesn't have to suffer the political blow of having the Supreme Court strike down his signature domestic achievement before the election.\nIt would also give the unpopular law more time to take root, and thereby give its supporters more time to stave off repeal.\nObamaCare doesn't go into full operation until January 2014.\nThe first time the IRS can levy the mandate penalty/tax won't be until folks file their tax returns, in mid-April 2015.\nThe slow judicial process will likely delay a final judicial ruling until mid-2016.\nBy which time, perhaps the public may have resigned itself to accepting this awful law.\nInterestingly, both sides in the case would prefer that the Court not punt.\nThe Administration's lawyers' request for extra time suggests that, while they want\u00a0the Justices to set aside the Tax Anti-Injunction Act,\u00a0they are not entirely confident of their ability to do so.\nThe lawyers on the anti-ObamaCare side agreed to the request for additional time, which suggests that they too are taking this issue seriously.\nThe Court agreed to grant the extra time, despite having already given an unprecedented five and a half hours to this historic case.\nToday's development is just another reason why we cannot count on the courts to repeal the government takeover of health care.\nHowever the courts finally rule, we citizens must keep fighting to protect our threatened health care liberties, in the halls of Congress -- and at the ballot-box.\nDean Clancy is FreedomWorks' Legislative Counsel and Vice President, Health Care Policy\nP.S.

Opinions are mixed. (Photo: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)\nBy Hal C. Scherz, MD\nTwelve months after the passage of one of the most controversial laws in American history, healthcare is still an unsettled issue. Never before has a president needed to go around the country to defend and sell a bill that he signed into law. America has been subjected to a law that over 1000 groups, representing 2.4 million people has been exempted from because they discovered that they could not afford the increased costs associated with it. This is before the law has even gone into effect. The bitter irony is that many of these groups who have received waivers were the most vocal proponents for this law, including the SEIU. This is cronyism at its worst and just a taste of things to come when the Federal Government, under the watchful eye of the Secretary of HHS decides what treatments doctors may deliver to their patients.\nAs physicians, we are already beginning to see the profoundly adverse effects of the Accountable Care Act (ACA) on us and our patients.\nThis year, the Medicare SGR (sustainable growth rate), which required a 23% reduction in physician reimbursement, was postponed 5 times. The final reprieve, resulted in Congress \u201ckicking the can down the road\u201d until January 2012, when the reduction becomes 29%. Meanwhile, the new Medicare fee schedule goes into effect in October, with across the board cuts of approximately 7%. During 2011, CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid) withheld payments to physicians on TWO occasions, for as long as 45 days. This presented tremendous hardships for doctors whose practices are largely made up of patients on Medicare and where these payments represent a large portion of their income.\nMany doctors needed to take personal loans to meet payroll. Many doctors did not take home a paycheck even though they had provided services. Some doctors needed to down size, which meant layoffs of employees, and still others needed to close their practices. And thousands of doctors, who have been caring for Medicare patients for over 40 years, simply had enough and either stopped taking new Medicare patients or left the Medicare system entirely. And who could blame them? Any business needs to have some degree of predictability in order to survive, and Medicare has become too unpredictable to base future decisions upon.\nThe losers are not so much the doctors as are the seniors. They have paid into a system during their working lives, and now many struggle to find a doctor. With $500 billion slated to be cut away from Medicare, the benefits that seniors will receive will diminish as well.\nThe care that these seniors and others receive will not be as good as the care that patients currently get. One reason is that the ACA makes it easier for non- physicians to deliver healthcare. The new law emphasizes the concept of \u201cmedical homes\u201d, which will be the gatekeeper in future healthcare delivery models. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants are elevated to physician status by virtue of this law. It is the attempt on the part of the federal government to convince the public that there is equivalency between all healthcare providers, but sadly that is just not so. It is the beginning of the attempt on the part of the government to condition the public for a lower standard of healthcare. This statement is not meant to be derogatory to this group of professionals, but simply stated, they are not doctors; they are physician extenders. It takes 7-15 years of education and training, long hours and personal sacrifice to become a doctor. A physician cannot simply be created by a legislative edict.\nYet, this is precisely what is happening around the country. Clinical psychologists in California are being giving hospital admitting and prescription writing privileges, optometrists in some states are given eye surgery privileges, including laser surgery privileges in Oklahoma, and nurse anesthetists are designated as equals to board certified anesthesiologists. Pharmacists are lobbying for the ability to change prescriptions written by physicians not to generics, but to entirely different drugs, if they think that it is warranted. And nurse practitioners are now able to do an extra year of training and come out with a doctorate degree in nurse practice, so that they can call themselves \u201cdoctor\u201d as they populate primary care clinics and medical homes.\nThe HITECH Act which was actually in the Stimulus Bill of 2009, was essentially activated by passage of ACA, so that now, all doctors who wish to receive the highest levels of reimbursement for the services that they will have already provided, will need to have a health information system in place that meets federal standards. This is not an entirely bad concept, were it not for the fact that the systems currently available are not yet ready to accomplish the integration of clinical information between doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and other sectors of the healthcare spectrum. We will get there at some point, but to force doctors to spend money now on systems that cannot meet these goals is absurd.\nThe systems are pricey, and the costs cannot be passed along, so doctors have to assume them all themselves. Consequently, less money will be available to spend on patients whether that means fewer personnel in doctors\u2019 offices to care for them or less sophisticated tools available for the doctors. The systems that doctors are being forced to adopt will soon be surpassed by better systems that will be developed that can do what we expect from them, and then doctors will have to incur the costs to retool their offices once again. The problem is that when the technology is developed, every doctor will want to adopt it and not before, just because it has been decreed. The money that is supposedly available to doctors who implement these systems and who demonstrate \u201cmeaningful use\u201d will barely cover the incurred costs, assuming that there is money available to begin with.\nThe government and insurance companies are looking for alternative healthcare delivery models and the ACA supports one such model- the Accountable Care Organization (ACO). This organization is intended to be a vertically integrated healthcare delivery system consisting of physicians of all specialties working together, by following clinical protocols and best practice models, so that care can be coordinated and waste can be eliminated, while delivering improved care. This medical utopia would work with the hospitals as partners, but what is instead happening around the country is that hospitals are buying up physician practices at a record pace so that they can control as many patients as possible and hence control the medical market in their community.\nThe physicians in this \u201csuper HMO\u201d are employees and they then have to choose between doing what is right for their patients and what their employers instruct them to do. This is already happening in hospitals across the country, but will escalate as more physicians, especially specialists, leave private practice because they fear that their practices will have no value if the hospitals control the flow of patients to them.\nBesides encouraging the formation of ASOs, the ACA has other provisions which are aimed directly at doctors, in an attempt to destroy the private practice of medicine; a necessary first step to get to a single payer, government run healthcare system. Working with a willing accomplice, the American Hospital Association (AHA), provisions were put into the ACA that eliminates future physician owned hospitals and surgery centers, imaging centers and laboratories. The exemptions to these ventures occur when they are connected to and are a part of the physicians\u2019 direct practice, but these exemptions are being challenged as well. The AHA is a very powerful lobby and as we have come to see, doctors have no effective lobbying group and are easy targets for every group that wants to push us around.\nFinally, the worst part of the ACA lies in the limitless power granted to the Secretary of HHS when it comes to healthcare matters. The Secretary determines what the clinical protocols are which doctors must follow if they wish to see patients who have insurance that is offered through the healthcare exchange. According to the ACA, there will be no insurance offered outside of the exchange. So if you want to see insured patients, you must follow the protocols approved by the HHS Secretary.\nIf this wasn\u2019t bad enough, the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness, a 15 person board appointed by the President and with no Congressional oversight, will decide what treatments doctors may offer to patients and which cannot. Simply, this is the beginning of medical rationing, and if the issue of waivers bothers you, then this should really scare you. \u201ctrial balloons\u201d have already been sent up in this regard. We have seen it with mammogram recommendations and with limiting Avastin for breast cancer patients. You can be certain that It will escalate as new ways to limit care are explored.\nDr. Scherz is the Founder and President/CEO of Docs 4 Patient Care ( www.docs4patientcare.org ).\n"}, {"score": 853.61487, "uuid": "7df46af3-6ed2-58ed-8182-4d82fc648a37", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0900tw-98-20454", "target_hostname": "pjmedia.com", "target_uri": "http://pjmedia.com/blog/obamacare-with-the-smoke-cleared-and-mirrors-cracked/", "page_rank": 1.184038e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "PJ Media \u00bb <em>Obamacare</em> with the Smoke Cleared and Mirrors Cracked", "snippet": "But like I said, not <em>any</em> that would support what you already want to believe.

It was slapped together with a myriad of side deals and compromises in order to get enough Democratic members of the House and Senate to pass it. No one had read the 2000-page monstrosity, but that didn\u2019t matter. At that time, Speaker Nancy Pelosi uttered words that would prove prophetic: \u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what\u2019s in it.\u201d\nOver the past two years, Americans have found out some of the details of the bill and don\u2019t like it. Despite the fact that President Obama said \u201cthe plan I\u2019m proposing will cost around $900 billion over 10 years,\u201d it is proving to be far more costly.\nFurther, with additional smoke and mirrors budget gimmicks, it was declared to actually reduce the deficit by $143 billion over 10 years. That required that the spending be offset with a variety of tax hikes and $500 billion in cuts to Medicare benefits.\nAdvertisement\nThe smoke is clearing and the mirrors are all cracked. Upon closer examination of the opaque Obamacare bill, the image isn\u2019t pretty.\nInstead of costing $940 billion over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recalculated the cost of Obamacare and found that the cost will almost double to $1.76 trillion over 10 years. That new estimate has gobbled up most of the expected savings Congress was to achieve under the sequestration required by the Budget Control Act when the super committee failed miserably to address the deficit.\nAnother smoke screen raised by President Obama was his promise that you will be able to keep your doctor under his health-care reform. With the smoke cleared, CBO now says that 4 million will lose their employer-provided health insurance as Obamacare forces businesses to end coverage for their employees.\u00a0 These unfortunate casualties of Obamacare will be forced into the government\u2019s insurance exchanges or forced into Medicaid or CHIP.\nHowever, the government-run insurance exchanges are a murky area too. Both CBO and the president\u2019s own budget people have seen the expected cost of the subsidies to these exchanges balloon enormously this year.\nThe House Ways and Means Committee has repeatedly questioned the Obama administration as to why this year they have requested significant new funding for the costs for the exchanges. Over the past year, Congress enacted technical changes that CBO said would reduce spending on the subsidies for the exchanges by $9 billion.\u00a0 Yet President Obama now says he will need $111 billion in new funding for the exchanges.\u00a0 No clear justification has been given for this new request.\nMillions of Americans would have already lost the coverage they were promised they could keep except for a massive number of waivers to Obamacare granted by HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius under authority which does not exist in the law.

I have experienced universal public health overseas and it is remarkable. For that reason I opposed President Obama's health care \"reform\" bill, because it began life already a slave to the insurance company-spawned ideology of health care as a market commodity and not a basic human right. Though cautioned against pursuing this strategy -- he was more than once urged to propose a single-payer model or at least to offer a public option -- the president never once deviated from this religion. Now his holy fealty is coming back to haunt him\nObamacare, as the new law has now been popularly retitled, is not about guaranteeing every American quality healthcare. What it guarantees is every American's right to buy health insurance. This week, I listened to the arguments made before the Supreme Court, among the attorneys and the Justices for and against Obama's healthcare reform law. The more I listened, the more I found myself agreeing with the plaintiffs, the attorneys general who brought suit to invalidate the so-called \"personal mandate\" requiring every American to purchase health care. The Solicitor General was blown away, not because he wasn't a competent litigator, but because his real client in this case -- the health insurance industry -- is indefensible.\nThey're right: the government has no such right. It cannot force citizens to purchase this or that thing -- or for that matter, not to purchase it -- unless there is a compelling public purpose. As anyone who currently pays for health insurance knows, there is no compelling purpose for it. Health insurance is a relatively recent invention, conceived (so the fable goes) to constrain needless medical expense. Of course, it has done no such thing. For many years, as a self-employed consultant, I paid enormous insurance company premiums -- as much as $7,500 a year. Even so, each year, between co-pays and the procedures not covered by insurance, I accumulated more than $1,000 in bills I had to pay. The health care company paid a third of that. I finally decided, after decades in the system, to reduce my premiums and pay out-of-pocket.\nI understand that others are not so lucky, those who suffer dreadful accidents or have chronic disease. I do not argue as do those on the right that these less fortunate should be forced to fend for themselves. We all are responsible for the well-being of others. This is not the argument that was made when Congress acted on Obama's initiative, nor did it come up even once in the arguments before the Supreme Court -- precisely because the case before the Supreme Court is not about well-being of others. It is about well-being of insurance companies that argued during the passage of the law that they could not deal with these responsibilities unless everyone chipped in and paid insurance premiums. Thus was born the individual mandate, the requirement to sign up with the new private universal health care system that is being argued about in the Supreme Court, with the government picking up the bill for low-income and indigent citizens.\nI suspect that the insurance companies made their ingenuous proposal never expecting the president to take them up on it. They rather hoped it would kill the bill. Or maybe they were thinking ahead and proposed the individual mandate as a time bomb that would go off during the 2010 election -- which it did -- and a poison pill that could kill Obamacare if allies at the state level brought suit before the Supreme Court -- which they did. And the poison is working. The individual mandate is indefensible. Despite the good face put on the Supreme Court proceedings by pro-Obama observers, the Supreme Court seems set to produce a 5-4 opinion invalidating the public mandate. That doesn't kill Obamacare, but it makes it politically vulnerable to repeal. Which will be bad on two counts.\nFirst, the repeal of the law will eliminate its better provisions, including those that ban insurance companies from discriminating against prospective customers based on pre-existing conditions. Second, it will set the stage for attacks on Social Security and Medicare based on the same argument, that government should not come between sellers and buyers of what are essentially discretionary products. (Never mind that government has no such inhibition regarding marijuana, which also has a place in health care -- but that's another story.) During interviews broadcast on C-SPAN, liberal Senators Schumer and Leahy purposely conflated Obamacare with Social Security and Medicare, as if raising the boogeyman will scare the right wing-leaning Roberts Supreme Court from striking down the former for fear of harming the latter -- a situation that the Republican/Tea Party would relish.\n(When asked by a reporter if they had a strategy in case the Supreme Court voted against Obamacare, the senators could only reply, \"Oh, but of course the Supreme Court has to uphold the individual mandate.\" Oh, but of course it needn't and likely, it won't. No one asked the same question of reactionary Senators McConnell, Corner or Rubio; everyone knows they're going after Social Security and Medicare. Someone should have thought about that in 2009 as Obamacare with an individual mandate was making its way through the then-Democratic Congress.)\nFrankly, I welcome the defeat of the individual mandate. It's a kludge intended to kill universal private health care, and it will. One way or another, it will bring down or diminish universally available health care. In Massachusetts, where Mitt Romney created Romneycare, the progenitor of Obamacare, health care costs are escalating, because unless one eliminates insurance companies in the mix, there is no way to contain them. Insurance companies' profits are directly related to the price of health care, it is in their self-interest that prices continue to skyrocket. That's why I want to throw a tomato every time a Democrat cites Massachusetts as the poster state for health care reform and therefore a suitable prototype for America. It's not. It's a disaster. Romneycare is about to be trimmed -- and with it, any value it has as a model for universal health care in America.\nLet's take a different tack. Let's go back to the single-payer model. If government provides a service, de facto it is properly and constitutionally available to all citizens. Take the trillions collected by the insurance companies and invest them in quality health care, \"Medicare for all.\" Then people can pay via their taxes, reasonable premiums when they're younger -- and when they're older, too. No one would be turned away, everyone would be secure, people could spend their money in better ways.\nAs Robert Reich recently observed in the Christian Science Monitor, a loss before the Supreme Court, even if a short-term negative for the president (perhaps), would open the door for him to promote universal public health care -- the single-payer model, a long-term positive for the president and every other Democrat at every level of government. Consider the financial benefit to the economy: insurance companies' overhead (including stupendous salaries for executives and dividends for shareholders) is typically 30 to 40 percent. For Medicare, a government program, it's 3 percent -- a much better societal bargain. Even Medicare fraud, a subject of constant opprobrium on the right, is considerably less costly than fraud in the private medical sector, much of it never identified as fraud because of sweetheart deals and customs among health care providers, medical technology and big pharma companies, researchers, policymakers and of course, insurance companies whose largess -- our premiums -- ties them all together.\nUniversal public health care would not be subject to Supreme Court review. It would not for long even be a subject on which the right-wing could dwell. Once societies provide universal public health care, it sticks. It doesn't become a talking point or a soundbite. Sure, people can debate the quality of the service, and should; with public health service comes a new realism regarding how people can live healthier and what the government, the private sector and citizens themselves can do to to make it so. Ironically, the Roberts Supreme Court can make possible the biggest advance in civilizing American society by voting 5-4 against the individual mandate. Give Obama something solid to run on: universal public health care. The President and the Democrats should consider this a gift.\nFollow Bob Jacobson on Twitter: www.twitter.com/Robert_Jacobson\n"}], [{"score": 849.9331, "uuid": "f29dccc9-1b4f-5504-bf7b-1d6429f5db1f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1000tw-65-08293", "target_hostname": "www.wral.com", "target_uri": "http://www.wral.com/business/story/10855449/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "&#x27;<em>Obamacare</em>&#x27; foes fear ballooning big government :: WRAL.com", "snippet": "&quot;<em>Obamacare</em>&quot; unites them.

The mom from North Carolina who opposes vaccinations and dislikes doctors and chooses to forgo health coverage because, she says, it is her right as an American. The Massachusetts Navy vet who feels health reform in his state has limited choice and ballooned costs. The husband-and-wife private investigators from Georgia who are satisfied with their own health plan and fear being forced to buy something more expensive.\nThey're coming, along with so many others, to Washington, D.C., this month. They will stand a few blocks from the U.S. Supreme Court, clutching handmade signs and chanting as one as the high court prepares to hear arguments \u2014 and renew debate \u2014 over a health care law that has divided Americans and become a rallying point among a chunk of the electorate for whom \"change\" has come to mean \"repeal.\"\n\"Obamacare\" unites them. But what inspires them to converge in protest is less the law itself than what it has come to represent to a lot of people: Big government at its worst.\n\"It is the epitome of being in my face and telling me what I can and can't do for the rest of my life,\" says Christine Gates, the North Carolina mom.\n\"What's next? They gonna tell you you can't wear a black T-shirt?\" says Carlos Hernandez, the Massachusetts veteran.\n\"With Bush is when I became more and more aware of the fact that government was spending more and requiring more ... when Obama took over, it went from second or third gear to fifth or sixth gear,\" says Michael Mancha, the private investigator in Georgia. His wife, Elizabeth, feels the health care law \"truly exemplifies how out of control the federal government has gotten. It's the big trophy on the mantle.\"\nThese are more than just rants from the anti-Obama crowd, but rather a sampling of the national conversation underlying so much of the angst among voters this election year \u2014 from Occupy protesters who rail not just against Wall Street but for the idea that \"we don't need politicians to build a better society\" to tea partiers who carry pocket copies of the Constitution and espouse the principle of \"constitutionally limited government.\"\nAmericans, Republicans and Democrats alike, are asking some fundamental questions about the state of the union that go beyond how to grow the economy, add jobs, lower fuel prices and curb foreclosures.\nAmong the most profound: What is \u2014 and perhaps should be \u2014 the role of government in our lives?\nThat many Americans believe government, the federal government in particular, has grown too big and powerful is hardly an earth-shattering revelation. It is one of the very reasons the tea party was born. Why debates over bailouts, stimulus packages and the national deficit have intensified. Why state legislatures are pushing back against congressional regulations. Why the champion of libertarianism, GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul, draws dedicated followers who cheer his proposals to end the Federal Reserve, repeal the federal income tax and abolish the Internal Revenue Service (along with the federal departments of Commerce, Education, Energy and more). And why more than two dozen states sued over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\nA December Gallup poll showed Americans' fear of big government has reached near-record levels, with 64 percent deeming it a bigger threat to the country than big business or big labor. Driving the increase was a rise in the percentage of Democrats who view the government as ever-more threatening.\n\"I think more and more people across the political spectrum are saying, 'Whoa. We don't want these people having this kind of power,'\" says Michael Boldin, executive director of the Tenth Amendment Center, a think-tank that supports limited government. \"'Obamacare' is the symbol for conservatives. Things like the NDAA\" \u2014 the National Defense Authorization Act, which was signed into law in December and could allow for the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism \u2014 \"are now becoming a symbol across the political spectrum.\"\n\"The way we see it is no matter what political party's been in power for probably a hundred years now ... government keeps growing. And people can protest, vote the bums out, or sue in court. It keeps happening.\"\nAnd now the anti-big-government mantra has become a dominant theme on the Republican campaign trail, with the health care law fomenting much of the furor.\n\"Are we a great country because we have a great and powerful federal government?\" Republican candidate Rick Santorum asked the crowd at a Lincoln Day lunch in Arizona.\n\"Noooooo!\" the audience shouted in response.\n\"Are we a great country because we have free people that will go out and pursue their dreams and build a great and just society from the bottom up?\"\n\"Yesssss!\"\n\"That's really the question in this campaign ...\"\nIn some ways it is, especially for conservative Americans who embrace the low-tax, limited-regulation, free-market principles of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan.\nThe statistics alone are enough to fuel the fire. Prior to the Great Depression, with the exception of times of war, the federal budget was either in surplus or close to balanced, according to the U.S. Office of Budget and Management. Then came the 1929 stock market crash, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal reforms to get Americans back to work \u2014 and a rising tide of federal spending, government expansion and budget deficits.\nIn 1930, federal spending was 3.4 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. By 1941, with the nation on the cusp of World War II, it was 12 percent. Today \u2014 after still more wars, economic crises, growth in government entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare, savings and loan troubles, bailouts, decreased revenues, tax cuts and more \u2014 federal spending is 24 percent of GDP, our national debt is $15 trillion and we face yearly federal budget deficits in the $1 trillion range.\nThis didn't just happen in a vacuum; government grows for a reason, and the United States is hardly alone among rich nations sporting big bureaucracies. Think back over the 20th century: Postwar growth spurred demand for roads and services; scientific advancements brought about new agencies and bigger investments (consider the \"space race\"); defense spending increased during times of war; the 9/11 attacks brought on more spending for counterterrorism and training of first responders as well as new agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration.\nHealth care reform was a response to the fact that more than 50 million Americans lack health insurance \u2014 and that their care in clinics and emergency rooms costs nearly $75 billion a year. The Obama administration's signature achievement would ensure that all receive medical insurance; the flip side is that the government says all MUST have medical insurance or pay a penalty.\nAdd to the mix the residue of the financial crisis \u2014 the bank and auto industry bailouts, the stimulus bills that contributed to a burgeoning federal debt \u2014 and the result is anger on both sides of the political spectrum.\nBut the issue has as much to do with emotion as it does economics. The \"big government\" debate challenges some of our most intrinsic beliefs as Americans, the very values on which the nation was founded: freedom, liberty, the right to live our lives as we see fit in the pursuit of happiness.\nWhen asked what matters most to them this election year (aside from defeating President Barack Obama), Republican voters often respond with answers that have nothing to do with the economy or jobs or housing or, even, debt and deficits. Rather, they begin talking about a loss of independence, a sense of powerlessness and mistrust, a feeling that government is simply too much in their business.\nThey refer to recent news reports about North Carolina schoolchildren who were made to eat cafeteria meals after a teacher decided their home-packed lunches failed to meet federal dietary guidelines required for government-funded school lunch programs.\n\"It's that outlook on things that is just so wrong. Like we can't run our own lives,\" says Margaret Birkemo, a missionary from Fountain Hills, Ariz.\nOr they condemn the controversial \"light bulb law,\" setting new energy-saving standards that would have meant an eventual end to old-style 100-watt bulbs in favor of those newfangled fluorescents. After a Republican-led fight last year to overturn the standards entirely, a deal was instead reached to delay enforcement until October. (In fact, the law including the new standards was signed by Republican George W. Bush.)\n\"I'm hoarding those old light bulbs,\" says Gates, who serves as president of her tea party group in Lenoir, N.C. \"I don't want any of those little curlicue ... things in my house. Uh-uh.\"\nOr they paraphrase the conservative champion of limited government.\n\"I think it's Reagan that said government's not the answer to your problem, it is your problem,\" says Don Graves, a school bus driver in Chandler, Ariz. \"You need to always worry when they say the government's going to take care of you. It's not the government's job. Yet that's what we've evolved to, and more so over the last three years than in the 200 years prior combined. That's the way I see it.\"\nHistorian Ballard Campbell, author of a book called \"The Growth of American Government,\" sees all of this mostly as recycled, election-year propaganda intended to rally the Republican base. A presidential election \"kicks up a lot dust on issues that intersect with the growth of government,\" he says. \"It's an old song that I've heard over and over again.\"\nDavid Ropeik puts it another way: \"America is juiced about government butting out.\"\nRopeik, author of the book \"How Risky Is It, Really? Why Our Fears Don't Always Match the Facts,\" is a Harvard instructor and an expert in risk perception who has examined the concerns over big government. He and Campbell agree that the debate has little to do with the actual size of government but rather is a manifestation of something deeper in the human spirit: the anxiety that comes with scary times brought on by a bad economy, concerns over terrorism, the widening gap between rich and poor, congressional gridlock and so on.\n\"There's something about these times that feels more threatening because people feel less control over their lives,\" says Ropeik. \"That triggers an afraidness inside that brings all of this to the fore.\"\nThese feelings also closely parallel Americans' overall degree of trust in elected leaders. Consider that Congress ended 2011 with its lowest approval rating since Gallup started polling on the subject in 1974. It was during that decade that the anti-big-government axiom really gained steam, says Jeff Madrick, a former financial columnist for The New York Times whose book \"The Case for Big Government\" argues the more optimistic view of government playing a vital role in society.\nIn the '70s, he says, \"we had very high inflation and very high unemployment simultaneously, and everybody lost confidence in government's ability to manage the economy. Things turned, and they never really turned back. Even (Democrat) Bill Clinton ... announced in a State of the Union address that it was the end of the era of big government. ... Ideologically, more and more people advocated this point of view.\"\nNow, argues Madrick, the \"big government\" crusade has been hijacked and exploited by those who, on the one hand, oppose government mandates that contraception be covered by health insurers, but on the other want more government regulation of abortion.\n\"It's kind of schizophrenic. Government is so demonized and objectified that people don't realize how much they benefit from it,\" he says. \"It's very irrational what's going on.\"\nYet even Madrick acknowledges the importance of all of this as Americans choose the next president. \"This election will determine the role of government in America,\" he says.\nThis is why the throngs will head to Washington this month, with Christine Gates, Carlos Hernandez and the Manchas among them. And why amid the signs warning \"Beware Obamacare\" you'll see just as many that don't mention health care at all. Gates dusted off her own posters this week in preparation for the bus ride north. They read: \"It's the Constitution Stupid!\" and \"No More Spending\" and \"Bankrupting America one unread bill at a time!\"\nThey would tell you, these voters, that they aren't so zealous as to expect \u2014 or even want \u2014 some radical obliteration of government as we know it today (although many Americans, including some of Paul's supporters, do). Increase efficiency, they say. Eliminate redundancy. Reduce regulation.\nAs Gates says: \"The Department of Agriculture does a lot of the same things the FDA does, but I don't think we should get rid of the entire FDA.\" Even when it comes to the oft-lambasted Environmental Protection Agency, \"I understand clean air and clean water. Of course I want those things.\n\"No,\" she says, \"I don't need everything eliminated. I certainly don't want to live in anarchy. But can you show me a big, efficient government?\nHer conclusion: \"They're mutually exclusive.\"\n___\nPauline Arrillaga, a Phoenix-based national writer for The Associated Press, can be reached at features(at)ap.org.\nCopyright 2012 by The Associated Press.

About 410,000 more African- American young adults who would otherwise be uninsured gained coverage due to the law. In addition, 5.5 million African-Americans with private health insurance now have coverage for preventive services without paying an extra penny at their doctor's office.\nAnd 10.4 million African-Americans with private insurance coverage no longer face lifetime limits thanks to the new health care law - in other words, your insurance company can no longer drop your coverage at a time when you need it most.\nBehind each of these are statistics are stories of mothers and fathers, daughters and sons, friends and neighbors, who are healthier because of the new law. I know firsthand that the Affordable Care Act is already making a difference in people's lives. When my daughter, Laura, was between school and a new job, she was able to go on my insurance plan thanks to the new health care law.\nClick here to watch the story of Vanessa Mishkit , a nurse in Tampa, Florida, who knows firsthand what it's like to go up against insurance companies on behalf of her child.\nThe new health care law will also make health care more accessible in the African-American communities most in need. Nearly 26 percent of patients served by community health centers in 2010 were African-American, and the Affordable Care Act increases the funding available to those centers in all 50 states. They currently serve more than 19 million patients, and by 2015, because of the health care law, they will be able to serve millions more.\nThe Affordable Care Act has also helped triple the number of clinicians in the National Health Service Corps since President Obama took office. The Corps is a network of primary care providers serving areas of significant need and helps medical students pay back their loans in exchange for their service.\nFinally, the new health care law is helping to level the playing field and eliminate health disparities, a key priority for the Obama administration. Today, African-Americans are less likely to have health insurance than Americans as a whole. They are also less likely to have access to a primary care physician and less likely to receive high quality care.\nCompared to non-Hispanic whites, the average African-American child is twice as likely to be hospitalized from asthma and more than four times as likely to die from it.\nThe Affordable Care Act takes steps to change all this. The Department of Health and Human Services has developed and is implementing the first-ever department-wide Action Plan to Reduce Health Disparities. The new health care law is providing new tools and resources to put the plan into action, including upgrading data collection standards to better understand and ultimately get rid of gaps in the quality of health and health care across groups.\nOver the next few years, the health care law will introduce new tools that will make a huge difference in the lives of millions of African-Americans, expanding access to health coverage to 34 million Americans, including nearly seven million African-Americans. Starting in 2014, Affordable Insurance Exchanges will serve as a one-stop marketplace for Americans, new tax credits will help families buy coverage, and Medicaid will be expanded to cover more low-income Americans.\nOf course, we still have a great deal of work to do to make sure every American has access to affordable, quality care, and eliminating health disparities .....\nPlease Login or Register to Rate this article\nPlease Login or Register to post comments on this article\n"}, {"score": 849.4114, "uuid": "dd3d62fe-da48-58a9-bdde-3bcae4b8ed6d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-67-01491", "target_hostname": "www.intellectualconservative.com", "target_uri": "http://www.intellectualconservative.com/2012/03/06/romney-obamacare-and-freedom/", "page_rank": 1.2014222e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "Romney, <em>Obamacare</em>, and Freedom | Intellectual Conservative Politics and", "snippet": "In an attempt to short-circuit the primary process at <em>any</em> moment when Romney seems to be &quot;ahead,&quot; suddenly myriad voices arise to say that everyone must just stop quarreling, and accept that anything <em>is</em> <em>better</em> <em>than</em> Obama.

For regardless of what the candidates, the liberal media, and the Establishment claim, the 2012 presidential election is not primarily about jobs, tax rates, or even how to respond to the Iranian nuclear quest. It is about whether the United States of America will continue to exist as a constitutional republic, or will complete its final transformation into what is euphemistically called a \"social democracy,\" i.e. an authoritarian regulatory state with periodic fundamentally meaningless elections to keep up appearances. The pivot on which this final transformation turns is Obamacare\u2014an issue on which Romney is in fundamental agreement with the Left.\nFirst, some harsh realities. If Obamacare is not repealed\u2014in its entirety\u2014by the president and congress elected in November, it will never be repealed. And then, like all socialist policies that are introduced into free societies in a \"limited\" form, it will expand. The provisions designed at the outset to maintain the illusion of a market element will be found \"inefficient,\" or \"inequitable.\" Over a few years, or perhaps a decade, most people will become accustomed to demanding more from this system. The political argument will shift away from the question of whether the government should provide healthcare, to the question of how much more control it ought to assume this year. Finally, political debate will be dominated by what, in effect, will be bureaucratic minutiae about the methods of regulating, funding, and prioritizing public healthcare \"services.\" Private healthcare will gradually become part of a national mythology of the \"bad old days\" of an unfeeling, uncaring, unfair America.\nIt is no accident that some of the most forceful voices on this issue, led by Mark Steyn, are people who have lived through various stages of this process in other countries. Listen to those of us who have had the misfortune of seeing America's future up close. There is no turning back: Government-controlled healthcare will end America as we know it. If that is too abstract for you, let's make it clearer: Government-controlled healthcare ends individual liberty, permanently. And no country is better equipped to understand exactly what this means\u2014or to feel the extremity of the loss\u2014than the United States of America.\nAmerica is the nation\u2014the only one\u2014founded explicitly upon a genuine theory of natural rights. In the formal document which declared the nation's independence from George III, the authors climbed to the top of the hill, planted the flag of God-given rights in the soil, and dared anyone, monarch or mob, to try to knock it down. And the first of these rights\u2014these pre-governmental claims that every human can make, as a matter of birthright, against every other human\u2014was the right to life. This is the \"negative right\" upon which everything else rests\u2014and from which a mere animal species derives its unique dignity, the Enlightenment's practical (i.e. political) manifestation of the classical \"divine spark.\"\nThe right to life, as it was understood by the Founders, is no polemical flourish or painterly flight of romanticism. It has a concrete signification, one which links our earthly, material life to the Reason which is our tiny stake in the divine. The right to life, at its most basic level, means this: A man must be allowed to pursue his own preservation. In short, no one may prevent you from trying to stay alive by whatever means you deem necessary. To deny you this is to deny your dignity\u2014to deny your existence as something more than merely animal.\nOne implication of this fundamental right is that you own your living body. It is your first and foremost piece of property. And from this ownership follows your right to the property that is created or acquired through the free use of your own physical life, i.e. through your time and labor. As all men have this same right to self-preservation, and all that flows from it, the rational constraints on your actions are just as natural in origin as your rights themselves. That is, the limits of your action in pursuit of your own preservation are defined by the identical rights to life and the free pursuit of property that all other men possess.\nThe American founding, grounded in these principles of reason, produced a nation of natural rights\u2014a community of men pursuing their own preservation, property, and interests in mutual respect for one another's dignity, and with laws designed precisely to ensure the maintenance of that mutual respect in practice.\nGovernment-controlled healthcare stands as a direct violation of the core principle of the free society, the natural right to life. If the state can restrict the actions whereby men might pursue their self-preservation through voluntary exchange; if the state can determine how or whether men may use and dispose of their property in that pursuit; and if the state can make decisions regarding your ability to gain access to various means of self-preservation, independently of your capacity and willingness to acquire them for yourself through voluntary exchange\u2014if all of these things are true, then the state is denying your ownership of your own body, and your natural right to preserve it. And these things are not merely the by-products of a government-controlled healthcare system; they are, in fact, the essence of such a system.\nGovernment-controlled healthcare rejects in principle the idea that men have a right to self-preservation. No more fundamental violation of your rights can be conceived. If this becomes entrenched in American life, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution will be null and void, merely quaint historical remnants with absolutely no binding authority over government action. That is why the Democrats have been so desperate to pass a bill that would begin weaving the principle of socialized medicine into the fabric of American society. It is why they passed the bill without reading it, and have stood behind it through strong and unrelenting public opposition. They know that if they can hold on to this one, little else matters\u2014the constitutional republic is ended.\nAnd this brings us back to the Republican primaries. The GOP Establishment has chosen as its nominee a man who supports the principles of government-controlled healthcare, who has instituted them as governor of a state, and who, in spite of his frequent attempts to invoke states' rights as grounds for distinguishing his plan from Obama's, did in fact argue in favor of a national version of his plan back when it was still trendy for Republicans to talk like Democrats about healthcare.\nIf you are inclined to say, \"Who cares what a candidate said in 2009?\" then let's update to February 22 nd, at the Arizona debate . When Obamacare became the focus of the debate, each candidate had an opportunity to explain why repeal was a priority for him. Newt Gingrich spoke in general terms about the danger of giving new coercive powers to government, and the inevitability of their expansion. Rick Santorum was the clearest of the four about the exact nature of the threat, referring to Obamacare as \"the biggest issue of this race, of government control of your lives.\"\nSantorum\u2014who, as David Catron explains in American Spectator, is the only candidate giving this issue the weight it deserves\u2014went further, directly challenging Romney to explain how someone who supported a state version of government-controlled healthcare could have any credibility in arguing against Obamacare during a presidential campaign. Romney, put on the hot-seat to justify himself specifically on this question of individual rights vs. government control, explained his reasons for repeal this way:\n\"If I'm President of the United States, I will repeal Obamacare for a lot of reasons. One, I don't want to spend another trillion dollars; we don't have that kind of money, it's the wrong way to go. Number two, I don't believe the federal government should cut Medicare by some $500 billion. Number three, I don't think the federal government should raise taxes by $500 billion, and therefore I will repeal Obamacare.\"\nEvery candidate left in this race has had ample time and opportunity to develop a position on Obamacare that at least sounds vaguely attuned to the constitutionalist needs of this moment. And yet, when Romney is handed the ball on this question, and with the issue being framed in explicitly constitutional, liberty-focused terms, his answer is that Obamacare is too expensive, requires higher taxes, and sucks too much money out of another massive entitlement program.\nNotice anything missing from that answer? Precisely. Just as Santorum charges, Romney is a blank on the heart of this question, and thus gives the issue to Obama. A Mitt Romney candidacy concedes to the Democrats the single defining question of this election year, namely whether individual rights are still the foundation of the American republic. Obama's answer is an explicit \"No.\" Romney's answer, however benignly intended, looks the same. He displays a basic lack of concern for the U.S. Constitution\u2014and perhaps more importantly, for the moral philosophy upon which the Constitution was built.\nEarly in the primary season, some principled conservatives, such as Mark Levin, felt obliged to concede that while they disliked Romney's lack of conservatism, they would, if push came to shove, support him as the nominee. Levin's way of phrasing this is that he would vote for an orange juice can over Obama. Others have made similar remarks, and of course it adds a little lightheartedness to a process fraught with anxiety. I think my favorite so far is that of my Minnesota radio buddy Guy Green, who says he'd prefer an urn of Reagan's ashes on the Oval Office mantle to four more years of Obama.\nNeedless to say, beating Obama is so important that one must indeed be willing to accept far less than one might have hoped for, if it should come to that. Amazingly, however, this acknowledgment of a willingness to hold one's nose if necessary has now been transformed into a quasi-rallying cry for Romney. In an attempt to short-circuit the primary process at any moment when Romney seems to be \"ahead,\" suddenly myriad voices arise to say that everyone must just stop quarreling, and accept that anything is better than Obama. I recognize these Romney supporters immediately. Every time I write an article which mentions that the Establishment is backing the wrong man, I receive a few comments from people who do not directly contradict my argument, but simply opine, \"I'd vote for a tomato can over Obama,\" \"I'd vote for a chimp over Obama,\" or what have you. They are saying, in effect, \"Stop resisting the Establishment; after all, anything is better than what we have now.\"\nIf Romney gets the nomination, constitutionalists could play this game of \"Anything-but-Obama\" all day long. I'd vote for a jar of chili sauce over Obama. I'd vote for the shoelace nibs from my dad's old sneakers over Obama. This game will come in particularly handy as a way to bide your time when Romney debates Obama on healthcare.\nThe serious question, however, is this: Would you vote for Obamacare over Obama? Americans must never lose sight of the fact that, for all the appeal of identifying the problem with one man, who can be defeated, the sad truth is that Obama, like any individual man, is dispensable to the Left's agenda in the long run. The one 2,700-page bill that bears his name, if not repealed early in 2013, will not only outlive this president and his successor\u2014it will outlive the most beautiful practical monument to the idea of freedom that men have ever built.\nAbove all else, that is what this election is about. Mitt Romney thinks the problem with Obamacare is that it is too expensive\u2014that it is not as good as Romneycare. To be sure, if he should win the nomination, conservatives will have no choice but to support him. But the main front in the war for the survival of the United States of America\u2014that hill on which the Founders planted the flag of natural rights\u2014is not even on Romney's map. Is that the best this primary process can produce?\nDaren Jonescu has a Ph.D. in Philosophy from McMaster University. He has contributed to Canada Free Press and American Thinker.

Actually, the people who use the term socialization are closer to the mark, since we all end up being forced (by the IRS, who will collect penalties from people who don\u2019t buy health insurance) to pay whatever insurance companies demand; the law socializes profits of private insurance companies.\n+2 # Guest 2010-03-25 18:26\nThe overall heath of Americans would be better served if pharmaceuticals were actually held accountable for all the killer drugs they put on the market with the approval of the criminal FDA.

I have experienced universal public health overseas and it is remarkable. For that reason I opposed President Obama's health care \"reform\" bill, because it began life already a slave to the insurance company-spawned ideology of health care as a market commodity and not a basic human right. Though cautioned against pursuing this strategy -- he was more than once urged to propose a single-payer model or at least to offer a public option -- the president never once deviated from this religion. Now his holy fealty is coming back to haunt him\nObamacare, as the new law has now been popularly retitled, is not about guaranteeing every American quality healthcare. What it guarantees is every American's right to buy health insurance. This week, I listened to the arguments made before the Supreme Court, among the attorneys and the Justices for and against Obama's healthcare reform law. The more I listened, the more I found myself agreeing with the plaintiffs, the attorneys general who brought suit to invalidate the so-called \"personal mandate\" requiring every American to purchase health care. The Solicitor General was blown away, not because he wasn't a competent litigator, but because his real client in this case -- the health insurance industry -- is indefensible.\nThey're right: the government has no such right. It cannot force citizens to purchase this or that thing -- or for that matter, not to purchase it -- unless there is a compelling public purpose. As anyone who currently pays for health insurance knows, there is no compelling purpose for it. Health insurance is a relatively recent invention, conceived (so the fable goes) to constrain needless medical expense. Of course, it has done no such thing. For many years, as a self-employed consultant, I paid enormous insurance company premiums -- as much as $7,500 a year. Even so, each year, between co-pays and the procedures not covered by insurance, I accumulated more than $1,000 in bills I had to pay. The health care company paid a third of that. I finally decided, after decades in the system, to reduce my premiums and pay out-of-pocket.\nI understand that others are not so lucky, those who suffer dreadful accidents or have chronic disease. I do not argue as do those on the right that these less fortunate should be forced to fend for themselves. We all are responsible for the well-being of others. This is not the argument that was made when Congress acted on Obama's initiative, nor did it come up even once in the arguments before the Supreme Court -- precisely because the case before the Supreme Court is not about well-being of others. It is about well-being of insurance companies that argued during the passage of the law that they could not deal with these responsibilities unless everyone chipped in and paid insurance premiums. Thus was born the individual mandate, the requirement to sign up with the new private universal health care system that is being argued about in the Supreme Court, with the government picking up the bill for low-income and indigent citizens.\nI suspect that the insurance companies made their ingenuous proposal never expecting the president to take them up on it. They rather hoped it would kill the bill. Or maybe they were thinking ahead and proposed the individual mandate as a time bomb that would go off during the 2010 election -- which it did -- and a poison pill that could kill Obamacare if allies at the state level brought suit before the Supreme Court -- which they did. And the poison is working. The individual mandate is indefensible. Despite the good face put on the Supreme Court proceedings by pro-Obama observers, the Supreme Court seems set to produce a 5-4 opinion invalidating the public mandate. That doesn't kill Obamacare, but it makes it politically vulnerable to repeal. Which will be bad on two counts.\nFirst, the repeal of the law will eliminate its better provisions, including those that ban insurance companies from discriminating against prospective customers based on pre-existing conditions. Second, it will set the stage for attacks on Social Security and Medicare based on the same argument, that government should not come between sellers and buyers of what are essentially discretionary products. (Never mind that government has no such inhibition regarding marijuana, which also has a place in health care -- but that's another story.) During interviews broadcast on C-SPAN, liberal Senators Schumer and Leahy purposely conflated Obamacare with Social Security and Medicare, as if raising the boogeyman will scare the right wing-leaning Roberts Supreme Court from striking down the former for fear of harming the latter -- a situation that the Republican/Tea Party would relish.\n(When asked by a reporter if they had a strategy in case the Supreme Court voted against Obamacare, the senators could only reply, \"Oh, but of course the Supreme Court has to uphold the individual mandate.\" Oh, but of course it needn't and likely, it won't. No one asked the same question of reactionary Senators McConnell, Corner or Rubio; everyone knows they're going after Social Security and Medicare. Someone should have thought about that in 2009 as Obamacare with an individual mandate was making its way through the then-Democratic Congress.)\nFrankly, I welcome the defeat of the individual mandate. It's a kludge intended to kill universal private health care, and it will. One way or another, it will bring down or diminish universally available health care. In Massachusetts, where Mitt Romney created Romneycare, the progenitor of Obamacare, health care costs are escalating, because unless one eliminates insurance companies in the mix, there is no way to contain them. Insurance companies' profits are directly related to the price of health care, it is in their self-interest that prices continue to skyrocket. That's why I want to throw a tomato every time a Democrat cites Massachusetts as the poster state for health care reform and therefore a suitable prototype for America. It's not. It's a disaster. Romneycare is about to be trimmed -- and with it, any value it has as a model for universal health care in America.\nLet's take a different tack. Let's go back to the single-payer model. If government provides a service, de facto it is properly and constitutionally available to all citizens. Take the trillions collected by the insurance companies and invest them in quality health care, \"Medicare for all.\" Then people can pay via their taxes, reasonable premiums when they're younger -- and when they're older, too. No one would be turned away, everyone would be secure, people could spend their money in better ways.\nAs Robert Reich recently observed in the Christian Science Monitor, a loss before the Supreme Court, even if a short-term negative for the president (perhaps), would open the door for him to promote universal public health care -- the single-payer model, a long-term positive for the president and every other Democrat at every level of government. Consider the financial benefit to the economy: insurance companies' overhead (including stupendous salaries for executives and dividends for shareholders) is typically 30 to 40 percent. For Medicare, a government program, it's 3 percent -- a much better societal bargain. Even Medicare fraud, a subject of constant opprobrium on the right, is considerably less costly than fraud in the private medical sector, much of it never identified as fraud because of sweetheart deals and customs among health care providers, medical technology and big pharma companies, researchers, policymakers and of course, insurance companies whose largess -- our premiums -- ties them all together.\nUniversal public health care would not be subject to Supreme Court review. It would not for long even be a subject on which the right-wing could dwell. Once societies provide universal public health care, it sticks. It doesn't become a talking point or a soundbite. Sure, people can debate the quality of the service, and should; with public health service comes a new realism regarding how people can live healthier and what the government, the private sector and citizens themselves can do to to make it so. Ironically, the Roberts Supreme Court can make possible the biggest advance in civilizing American society by voting 5-4 against the individual mandate. Give Obama something solid to run on: universal public health care. The President and the Democrats should consider this a gift.\nFollow Bob Jacobson on Twitter: www.twitter.com/Robert_Jacobson\n"}, {"score": 846.2646, "uuid": "5dde58d5-784f-5930-a3dd-598c828f688c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0800tw-53-05221", "target_hostname": "opinion.latimes.com", "target_uri": "http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2012/03/healthcare-reform-law-plaintiff-files-for-bankrupcty-is-it-karma.html", "page_rank": 1.2877285e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "&#x27;<em>Obamacare</em>&#x27; plaintiff Brown&#x27;s bankruptcy: Instant karma? - latimes.com", "snippet": "(It&#x27;s also why a single-payer system such as <em>Medicare</em> would&#x27;ve been a <em>better</em> option <em>than</em> the law we&#x27;ve got, but that&#x27;s another post.)

Fate? A lucky break for President Obama?\nReally, you can't make this stuff up. Here's what The Times' David Savage wrote Thursday :\nMary Brown, a 56-year-old Florida woman who owned a small auto repair shop but had no health insurance, became the lead plaintiff challenging President Obama's healthcare law because she was passionate about the issue.\nBrown \"doesn't have insurance. She doesn't want to pay for it. And she doesn't want the government to tell her she has to have it,\" said Karen Harned, a lawyer for the National Federation of Independent Business. Brown is a plaintiff in the federation's case, which the Supreme Court plans to hear later this month.\nBut court records reveal that Brown and her husband filed for bankruptcy last fall with $4,500 in unpaid medical bills.\nNow, you might expect Brown to be a bit, well, chagrined at this turn of events.\u00a0 But remember, as Savage wrote, she \"was passionate about the issue.\"\nAnd she apparently still is:\nBrown, reached by telephone Thursday, said the medical bills were her husband's. \"I always paid my bills, as well as my medical bills,\" she said angrily. \"I never said medical insurance is not a necessity. It should be anyone's right to what kind of health insurance they have.\n\"I believe that anyone has unforeseen things that happen to them that are beyond their control,\" Brown said. \"Who says I don't have insurance right now?\"\nWho says? Well, Mary, your lawyer for one. Remember: She \"doesn't have insurance. She doesn't want to pay for it. And she doesn't want the government to tell her she has to have it.\"\nOh yeah, that.\u00a0 Those lawyers, always running their mouths.\nAnd for that matter, Mary, those aren't your husband's medical bills, at least not anymore. \u00a0Now that you've filed for bankruptcy, they are probably our medical bills, aren't they?\nAlthough it's not as though Brown is totally anti-government: The couple's Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition said her income was $275 a month in unemployment benefits.\nSo perhaps she intends to put that toward what she owes: \"$2,140 to Bay Medical Center in Panama City, $610 to Bay Medical Physicians, $835 to an eye doctor in Alabama and $900 to a specialist in Mississippi.\"\nOr maybe, as the story says, there's that other way out:\n\"This is a very common problem. We cover $30 million in charity and uncompensated care every \u00a0year,\" said Christa Hild, a spokeswoman for the hospital center. \"If it's a bad debt, we have to absorb it.\"\nAlthough when the hospital center says \"we,\" it means \"us\"\u00a0\u00a0-- as in you and I, the ones who do pay for health insurance. \u00a0We absorb it, in higher premium costs.\nIt's called the free market, or \"there's no free lunch.\"\u00a0 (It's also why a single-payer system such as Medicare would've been a better option than the law we've got, but that's another post.)\nBut it's also why the \"individual mandate\" requiring all Americans to purchase health insurance was put into the law.\nWhy that is so hard for Brown and millions of other citizens to understand is beyond me.\nThis isn't Charles Dickens' London: We don't have debtors' prisons. \u00a0If Brown and her fellow travelers have their way and the healthcare law is ruled unconstitutional, many others will take the risk \"of unforeseen things that happen to them that are beyond their control.\"\nAnd if they get sick, and have medical bills they can't pay, then they won't pay.\u00a0 And neither will the Tooth Fairy, or the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus.\nThe rest of us will pay.\nYou see, Mary, the requirement that everyone buy health insurance isn't big bad government taking away your freedom.\nIt's just common sense.\n"}, {"score": 843.1656, "uuid": "6b5ac171-4f34-5b73-94d9-b5f52558a483", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0411wb-93-32183", "target_hostname": "www.brookfieldnow.com", "target_uri": "http://www.brookfieldnow.com/blogs/communityblogs/69261712.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "<em>ObamaCare</em> passed House: Some frogs must like it hot! - BrookfieldNOW", "snippet": "I don&#x27;t love the system as it <em>is</em> now, but it <em>is</em> far <em>better</em> <em>than</em> oppressive ObamaCare&#x27;s takeover of the health insurance industry and being the sole provider of healthcare.

How on earth are we going to pay for that?\nFailure to purchase ObamaCare could result in up to 5 years in prison and/or $250,000 fine : \"Section 7203 - misdemeanor willful failure to pay is punishable by a fine of up to $25,000 and/or imprisonment of up to one year.\" \"Section 7201 - felony willful evasion is punishable by a fine of up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment of up to five years.\" [page 3]\nOn the surface, the only bright spot of Pelosi's ObamaCare bill was that taxpayer funded abortion was eliminated. But this was just a\n. It was Pelosi's way of diffusing conservative opposition and making sure her bill would make its way over to the Senate. We all know it will go back into the final bill.\nRepublicans have felt the\nheat\nsince Obama came to office; they jumped out of the pot months ago. A few Blue-Dog Democrats jumped out on Saturday night's vote, too. As for the remaining 220* Democrats who voted for Pelosi's ObamaCare, the only conclusion is that they like it hot!\nOne Republican, Rep. Cao, voted for ObamaCare\n. The Abortion omission won him over. \"\nCao said he did not make any deals with President Obama in exchange for his vote.\" ...\"The president and I, we have had a very good relationship, and I thank him and his administration for their hard work in helping me to rebuild my district after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina,\" Cao said Sunday. \"I'm pretty sure that if I were to vote no against the bill the president would still continue to work with me to address the needs of my district.\n\"\n"}]]}
