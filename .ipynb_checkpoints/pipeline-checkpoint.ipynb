Apart from bad acting, one other thing I noticed was grossly mis-interpreted version of a court case of a rape victim.\\nI am not familiar with the legal proceedings, but my question is, rape is the fundamental aggregation on the soul of the woman. Can you penalize the guilty? Can the person who committed the horrible crime be punished enough for the trauma the woman has to undergo in case of rape? Obviously you can’t.\\nAnother gross concept in the movie, which can be true, was the social pressure on the girl for not getting proper groom. Is our society so jobless that getting a groom for marriage is ultimate nirvana in life? Is there no other option available for you to do, like maybe get a life, get out of house, confident and brave and face the world out there and maybe fall in love again? Does the life ends with marriage? And yes does life ends with marriage before 25 years?\\nWhen a girl faces trauma like rape, abuse etc the first basic instinct is to shut up about it, else she won’t get a good groom or maybe she will be shamed in the society. This suppresses the feelings emerging out of the horror act and all the guilt, shame and anger get mixed up inside her and create her a hollow active volcano, ready for violent outburst. What is more important?\\nSaving the girl or punishing the guilty, we have to choose.\\nAgain who is guilty? The person who raped her? The person who condemned her in shame for getting raped (usually mothers)? The person who deemed marked her as rape victim (the court, the society)? Who are we to judge what is right and what is wrong? The person who raped the girl is just the tip of ice berg for the trauma the poor soul has to face daily in and out. The prying eyes, the judging societies and unjust humans.\\nA few days ago, I was glancing at a news in news paper. The woman alleged she was ‘raped’ by her boyfriend in pretext of marriage. As ridiculous as this news sound, I realized that not only are we subjecting to rape trial cases in mockery, we have created mockery of the complete term of ‘rape’.\\nHaving ’sex’ and a ‘rape’ are two completely different ideas. While the former is enjoying the feeling between two individual species, the later is aggression of the will power of one over another. The boyfriend in question can be charged under section 420 and 419, fooling people and definitely not under section 375 and Section 376(Rape).\\nNot only are we humiliating the victims of rape, we are also not worried about creating a mockery of the concept all together.\\nOne of my noble friend one day spend an hour convincing that couples sitting on the rocks of the band-stand are shame to the country and culture. I reminded him, that they actually are safeguarding the ancient culture of our country, which is now engraved into stone at the temples of khajurao and many other temples in south and north India, at which he flinched his mouth.\\nMany scholars will argue that the engravings on the templates filled with lust and ecstasy should be buried down, but do they see that the couples sitting on band-stand or maybe the statues on the walls of Khajurao are busy in their own world and are not looking at you?\\nA levitated state separating them from the bounds of society, culture and worldly pleasures, deep in a trance, in peace, a state which many Sadhus and monks spend years attaining. By looking at them, we are the intruders.\\nWe are the judges and the jury. These two sets of lovers are thus manifestations of nature, in all her myriad glory. The ancient people believe in submitting to those instincts which were natural, modern religious revolution suggest to go against the nature, thus creating the concept of lust, instead of love and giving birth to another rapist.\\nNature does not judge, we humans do, a curse upon the entire humanity is that we have the brains to judge each other. A rape victim is subjected to humiliation at every step, every second, not understanding her plight and trauma sometimes by her own family. A confused soul self labels herself as rape victim and mocks the very concept of ‘rape’ while we all with our eyes judge the two people, celebrating the instinct of nature.\\nWe live in funny times indeed.\\nP.s. The torture of watching television has its own merits. If we suffer in this life, we get a better one in next. One prime time watch of a television channel, can make me the president of united states in next life. Just telling.\\nP.p.s Hope you understand the different in the three terms before your son in 7th standard does in Sex-ed classroom.\\nShare if you care\\n'},\n",

       "    'document': 'Sunday, 11 December 2011 10:08 Jose Bosque\\nUser Rating:\\nPoor\\nBest\\nRecently I was asked by a young Twitter friend to develop a Dating Blog. Obviously, he must have like our JC On Point Youth and Singles magazine inside of www.JaxChristian.com and wanted more.\\nMy first reaction was when will I find the time? With 4 websites, 5 blogs and 35 Social Media networks plus all the other work I do for others, my greatest need is time. I also thought to myself, what do I have to say to this generation concerning dating? Things have changed so much and it has been years since I lived in that world. Well, like a true romantic and with my love for young people it wasn’t long before the Holy Spirit gave me this word.\\nFirst, I would like to say that there is a vast difference between Love and Lust.\\xa0 If you hang with me I want to take a few minutes to describe some of the differences.\\nWhat is the basis behind this article?\\nI believe in real love. *-I believe it is much greater than a 21 gun salutes, seeing stars, hearing bells and having a squadron of jets flying overhead as Hollywood portrays it in movies. Real love is all of that and much more. Real love is MAGNETIC!\\nI believe this generation has settled for less. It’s all about me, my needs and my comfort. Driven by selfish desires people are shacking up for convenience but there is no spark between them. (For you newbies “shacking up” is the 20th century term for living together without marriage or your “try before you buy” philosophy.)\\nHow do you know when you are driven by Lust?\\nLust is comfortable, it’s calculated and convenient. It gratifies our flesh and lust is not complicated. Relationships on this level are somewhat easier to jump in and out of and except for the usual division of personal effects it (feels) relatively harmless. While at first there might be some amount of regret the more you do it the harder your heart gets and the easier it is to do.\\nLet me describe the calculated side of lust. You never give more than you get. Extra giving is only the result of extra getting. Both sides keep the ruler out and no one is willing to invest an ounce of extra effort in the relationship. Yes, they are in a relationship but it’s measured and unless you are drunk or high it’s really boring (and they are really boring together.)\\nLust is driven by the flesh and the flesh is all about externals so when body parts head south because of age so does desire to stay together. (Lust cannot weather sickness, loss of a job, distance or anything which demands a withdrawal since lust makes no deposits.)\\nLust is a decision of the mind and sex is its finish line. (self-gratification) Next time you \"make love\" time how long the \"afterglow\" lasts. It speaks volumes!\\nIn a Lust relationship the two never become one. They may learn to co-exist for appearances sake, for the childrens sake,or even for their respect for the institution of marriage but they will never be one.\\nHow do you know it’s Real Love.\\nReal love is based in the heart. The Bible says the eyes are the window to your soul or heart. That is why when people are in love you can see it in their eyes.\\nReal love is not rational or logical. Real love is chemistry. It is unexplainable it just is! It’s exciting to the heart and its overwhelming to the mind.\\nReal love has no expectations because it too busy giving. It would rather give than receive. It doesn’t have time to measure because it cherishes the relationship.\\nReal love costs because it requires deposits and withdrawals. That is why Real love needs so much communication because it cares so much.\\nSeparation, time and distance cannot quench real love because it doesn’t live just in the present but lives in the heart internally and eternally.\\nAge cannot affect real love. In fact the longer the give and take the stronger the bonds of love become.\\nReal love is spontaneous it doesn’t matter where we are going as long as we are going together. It doesn’t need Las Vegas because there is already enough music and bright lights in the hearts of those who are truly in love.\\nSex in real love is the culmination but never the destination. Real love doesn’t need sex. It gives because it loves not because it should, it owes or it’s expected of me.\\nReal Love begins with a 0% expectancy rate- Real love is not thinking about ROI (Return on Investment)\\nReal Love is a dying process-(there is an old cuban proverb that says\"To Him that loves what he is doing even though it kill him, His death will taste like Glory!\"\\nI pray that you will wait for love. It would be sad to find yourself getting old after hundreds of mates or getting to a place where you are having to be told you need to sit together because you are married.\\n1 Cor 13:4-8\\n(from THE MESSAGE: The Bible in Contemporary Language © 2002 by Eugene H. Peterson. All rights reserved.)\\n4 Love never gives up. Love cares more for others than for self. Love doesn\\'t want what it doesn\\'t have. Love doesn\\'t strut, Doesn\\'t have a swelled head,\\xa05 Doesn\\'t force itself on others, Isn\\'t always \"me first, \"Doesn\\'t fly off the handle, Doesn\\'t keep score of the sins of others,\\xa06 Doesn\\'t revel when others grovel, Takes pleasure in the flowering of truth,\\xa07 Puts up with anything, Trusts God always, Always looks for the best, Never looks back, But keeps going to the end. 8 Love never dies. (from THE MESSAGE Bible)\\nFor the record, only Christ can heal the wounds and scars (they are there whether you see them or not) that this generation is inflicting on each other.\\nI know there so much more to say but maybe some of you reading this can take a few minutes and share your comments below so that this generation can get some help. God knows they need it!\\nFor Love’s sake,\\n'},\n",

Bookmark the permalink . Leave a comment\\nIn the past, I’ve had sex, I’ve been laid, or whatever way you prefer to say it, but it is nothing compared to when you make love. I know people who will argue you down to the ground about sex and lovemaking having no difference. If we were to say physically, of course there is no difference, but if we are talking about passion, emotion and mental, the two are VERY different!\\n1. The First Time.\\nWhen you first make love with your significant other, it’s most of the time a very special moment. Sometimes it planned in advance, especially if it is the beginning of a relationship. There normally is some sensual foreplay and it seems as though your bodies fit perfect with one another.\\nWhen it’s the first time with a new significant other it can just be a spontaneous thing which could be the result of “just having sex”. In this case, not to say it’s a random person, but it may not be someone you are dating at the time or that person you have a huge crush on. This could just be a choice made strictly on inpulse or hormonal, (thanks ciroc!). Most cases, this first time with this person can get very sloppy and unorganized which makes things awkward when looking for a good position. Afterwards, either both of you or one of you will feel like there is definitely something missing!\\n2. Drunk Lovemaking?\\nNow I know that drunk sex exists but drunk lovemaking; you all are taking it too far. I would love to hear that story about someone completed wasted experiencing lovemaking.\\n3. Turn off the lights………\\nSo picture this, a lightly dimmed room, candles lite all around, bed just overwelmed with rose petals, this is the love making tone. Now the backseat of your car, in your pantry, coat closet, or any other space big enough to house storage items that can cause legal repercussions, it’s sex.\\nWho doesn’t want to imagine places like sex in wooded quiet areas on laid out on the beach? Well in a fairy tale, that sounds all nice and dandy, but sand finding it’s way into places can ruin a little bit of the mood.\\n4. Turn on some of that Teddy……\\nLovemaking songs can include music from Barry White or Teddy Pendergrass, even newer music like Keith Sweat or Brian McKnight. Now those sex songs range around Trey Songz, Lil Wayne, or mostly any song containing more profanity and fantasies than realities and sensuality. Even Jeremih’s “Birthday Sex” is a little far off the deep end of just sex.\\nOf course every time you have sex or make love music doesn’t have to be playing. Just think about the times music was playing, and think about what WAS playing!\\n5. The morning after…..\\nThe majority of the time, making love is followed by the spooning and the cuddling but comes after multiple mutual orgasms (if you’re lucky). A “post sex” type approach would be followed by him plowing over and going straight to sleep. Then there is that phrase, “that was great” but he didn’t notice that you didn’t even orgasm! So in this case, if you were single, this is where the walk of shame happens. Now there are the times that are very rare. You can make love to a person with no commitment whatsoever, but in the morning, you get waffles and a few more gos at last night’s events. Maybe a relationship can start out from this one.\\nFrom my own opinion (and experience), it is very likely that people have sex more times than they make love. Even though this is going to happen often, when that one person surfaces, and you care for them as much as they care for you, you will appreciate all the lovemaking. When this happens, you won’t even remember those one nights stands with whatshisname.\\nDo you think sex and lovemaking are different or the same? Share your thoughts below!\\nShare this:\\n'},\n",

       "    'document': 'August 10, 2011 at 5:11 pm\\nI think I get both hypomania and mania. My mind tends to go pretty quick anyway so I don’t notice thoughts “racing” until they’re really going so fast I’m losing track then my thoughts are like fireworks, exploding all over the place. I can tell I’m in full mania when I close my eyes and see vivid imagery (making it impossible to sleep).\\nI have gone manic enough for my thoughts to become totally garbled and to break up into noise, which I was yelling out at the top of my voice, unalbe to think in English any more. That wasn’t particularly nice.\\nI found I actually felt better as the mania became less intense. In the big episode I had this year I went from depressed to full-blown manic with visions and voices in 3 days. On day 1 I was probably hypomanic, on day 2 irritable and paranoid; on day 3 I was already grandiose. It peaked about 4 days later when I was higher than I’ve gone on any drug and I’ve tried them all.\\nThe whole thing took about 10 weeks to wear off and as I say I felt better in the long hypomanic stage at the end than during most of the mania. When I was manic I could lose my temper just from thinking about something (and I did a LOT of thinking). If only I could harness the best of it and get rid of the worst…. and if only I could live without depression.\\nI’m only glad I’ve gone higher on mania than low on depression ~ even though I’ve spent far longer depressed than manic. It also, incidentally, took me 20 years to get diagnosed and I’m labelled schizoaffective not bipolar. My dr says I was too floridly psychotic to be just manic (I hallucinate very vividly), and this is using ICD10 criteria. In America I might be bipolar, as I’m not sure I’ve had hallucinations and/or delusions in the absence of marked mood symptoms for 2 weeks or more. Basically because I’ve never gone 2 weeks without marked mood symptoms and because the antipsychotics break up the psychosis better than they dispel the mood swings and I’m not prescribed a mood stabilizer.\\nThose oppressive thoughts you describe sound nasty. My problem tends to be the “flight of ideas” ~ I jump from topic to topic, totally forgetting where I’ve been and why I’m there. I can do this in writing almost as badly as in speech. I’m prone to tangentiality even in a normal mood, so when the mood is “elevated” it really becomes marked sometimes. I’ve also found not all the symptoms peak at the same time, so I might feel higher one week but far speedier the next. The only really good book I’ve read on mood disorders is Emil Kraepelin’s Manic-Depressive Insanity and Paranoia. It blows all recent efforts out of the water!\\nAlex W\\nFebruary 24, 2012 at 3:21 pm\\nI am a teenager and I was diagnosed with BP when I was 12 following a move from the city with my family. I have been on meds since about then. Last October, I did something I would never suggest to anyone. I went of my meds without my doctor’s permission. It was a VERY bad idea. I went through a depression so bad that I tried to/thought about committing suicide several times. I have been a cutter for several years.\\nHowever, recently some of my friends and my new therapist have been a wonderful help. My three closest friends, Ben, Madison, and Steph, have pulled be back and helped me through so much these past few years! They have been there for me no matter what mood I have been in. I am posting here to remind everyone that even when everything is at its worst there are ALWAYS people who care. Even when you feel that it would be better to die there are ALWAYS people who will miss you and wish that you had told them what was going on. NEVER EVER EVER forget that! It may be so difficult to remember that when you are depressed or in a mixed state, but try to remember that you are worth more than any object in the entire world.\\nYou are a human, made in God’s image. He loves you and will always love you! It took me so long to realize that, but now that I know I understand so much more. Jeremiah 29:11-14 says “11 ‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. 12 Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 13 You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.’”\\nI have been working on improving my control over my moods for several years now. I am a little better off now, but it is mostly because of my friends, my therapist and God. I have been safely back on my meds for the past year and a half and I am so grateful that my attempts did not work! God has given me this life back for a reason and I am thankful that I have friends who can help me figure out that reason. God loves you, never forget that!\\nLeave a Reply\\nYour email address will not be published.

Love Love and sex are NOT the same thing. Love is an emotion or a feeling. There is no one definition of love because the word \"love\" can mean many different things to many different people. Sex, on the other hand, is a biological event. Even though there are different kinds of sex, most sexual acts have certain things in common. Sex may or may not include penetration. Differences Between Love and Sex Love Love is a feeling (emotional). There is no exact \"right\" definition of love for everybody. Love involves feelings of romance and/or attraction. Sex: Sex is an event or act (physical). There are different kinds of sex but all kinds of sex have some things in common. Can happen between a male and a female, between two females, between two males, or by one\\'s self (masturbation) Abstinence The word for not having sex is called abstinence. Some people, especially people who think it\\'s not cool to wait to have sex, think that abstinence is a completely bad thing. Actually, there are some really good things about abstinence and some of them might apply to you. Abstinence, or not having oral, vaginal or anal sex, is the best way to protect yourself. It is possible to get an STD even without having intercourse (penetrative sex) through skin toskin contact (herpes and genital warts can be passed this way). You also have to think about your own personal values and feelings. Your teenage years bring a lot of changes in how you feel about yourself, family, friends and potential love interests even if you don\\'t think about sex. No matter what your feelings on sex are, it may be smart to wait until something \"feels right.\" Ways to Express Love Without Sex There are millions of nonsexual ways to show someone you like them. You can show a person you care for them by spending time with them. Go to the movies. Or just hang out and talk. If you are with someone you really like, then anything can be fun. There are other ways to feel physically close without having sex. These ways include everything from kissing and hugging to touching and petting each other. Just remember that if you\\'re not careful these activities can lead to sex. Plan beforehand just how far you want to go, and stick to your limits. It can be difficult to say NO and mean it when things get hot and heavy.\\n'}}"
