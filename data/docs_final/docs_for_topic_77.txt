Fill half of your plate with vegetables.\u00a0Eat more dark green veggies, such as broccoli, kale, and spinach; orange veggies, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, and squash; and beans and peas, such as pinto beans, kidney beans, black beans, garbanzo beans, split peas, and lentils.\nFocus on fruits. Choose whole fruit instead of juice to get more fiber and less sugar. Aim for at least 2 cups a day.\u00a0What counts as 1 cup of fruit: 1 small apple, 1 large banana, about 30 grapes, 1 medium grapefruit, 1 large orange, 1 large peach, 1 medium pear, 2 large plums, 8 large strawberries, 1 cup canned fruit, \u00bd cup dried fruit.\nChoose calcium-rich foods. Get 3 cups of fat-free or low-fat milk, low-fat yogurt and/or low-fat cheese every day.\nEat whole grains. Eat at least 3 ounces of whole-grain cereals, breads, crackers, rice, or pasta every day. One ounce is about 1 slice of bread, 1 cup of breakfast cereal,\nor \u00bd cup of cooked rice or pasta. Make sure that grains such as wheat, rice, oats, or corn are referred to as \"whole\" or \u201cwhole grain\u201d at the beginning of the ingredients list.\nGo lean with protein. Choose lean meats and poultry. Bake it, broil it, microwave it, or grill it. And vary your protein choices\u2014with more fish, beans, peas, nuts, seeds, and soy products. For more information about fish, visit http://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/mom-to-be-tools/fish-facts.pdf\nLimit fats and salt. Read the Nutrition Facts label on foods.\u00a0Choose foods with less than 30 percent of the calories from fat and less than 10 percent of the calories from saturated fats.\u00a0Eat less than 2,300 mg (approximately 1 teaspoon of salt) of sodium per day and choose and prepare foods with little salt\nLimit sugars. Drink plenty of water instead of sweetened drinks.\u00a0Fruit drinks, regular soft drinks, sweets, cookies, cakes, and candies provide empty calories and cause rapid changes to your body\u2019s blood sugar.\nLimit fast food. If you do have fast foods sometimes, you can still make healthier choices.\u00a0Choose foods that are grilled instead of fried.\u00a0Have a salad, soup, or fruit instead of fries. \u00a0Use mustard or ketchup instead of mayonnaise.\u00a0Order smaller entr\u00e9e portions.\u00a0For example, instead of a large sub, try a small sub with a side salad or fruit.\nFor more tips on healthier eating, go to http://www.choosemyplate.gov\nEasy-to-read printable version En Espa\u00f1ol\nExternal Links:\nThe link(s) below may take you to an external web site.

A heavy based pan will heat evenly and hold its heat during the cooking process.\nIt\u2019s best to use a pan that suits the number of pieces to be cooked. The pan must be of a size to hold the meat snugly. Over crowding the pan will trap the meat juices in the bottom and the meat will stew. If the pan is too large the meat juices will burn in the areas where the meat does not cover them.\nTurn meat once only. It\u2019s best to cook the first side until the first sign of moisture appears on the uncooked side, turn and cook further. For lamb tenderloin/fillets or eye of loin/backstrap you may need to turn the meat three or four times so all sides are browned.\nTest if the meat is ready with tongs.

Do not crowd the pan when shallow-frying as it will reduce the heat and the crumb coating will soak up the oil.

At the same time, consumers are seeking more natural and organic ingredients, spices and exotic ethnic touches while clamoring for fewer additives such as MSG, hydrolyzed proteins and hydrogenated oils. Oh, and make them healthier, too.\nAll of those factors are good news, showing America's continuing love affair with savory snacks -- as long as snack manufacturers can meet those needs without sacrificing crunch and flavor.\nWhat could say savory snacks better than chips? But not necessarily potato chips. Several manufacturers are putting a new face on what surely is the definitive snack staple. One new face is appropriately named Sensible Portions, the premier brand of World Gourmet Products Inc. ( www.sensibleportions.com ), Wayne, N.J.\nThe Sensible Portions line presents a wide array of \"better-for-you\" snacks, including \"all-natural\" choices such as multigrain crisps, pita crackers and pita chips. In addition to featuring convenient packaging that provides built-in portion control, the processor includes functional ingredients such as whole grains, soy protein, vitamins, iron and fiber. Not invited are trans fats, saturated fats and cholesterol. Sensible Portions provides a healthier feel to snacking that also is highly marketable.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnother bold, new face in chips comes via a focus on alternatives to wheat and corn flour, specifically beans. Doug and Dave Foreman, owners and founders of Bean Brand Foods Inc. ( www.beanitos.com ), Austin, Texas, were early adopters of this approach. They mix pinto beans or black beans with whole grain rice and flax seed to create bean dough that they cut into a round shapes, bake and flash fry in pure vegetable oil.\nNote to Manufacturing: The Total Package\nOnce you've developed the new snack -- including how to get functional ingredients into the recipe, and solved the technical challenges of taste, texture, freshness, safety, and convenience -- there's another step: shelf life.\nHow do you keep your product fresh for the 45-60 days from the line to the truck and then on the shelf \u2026 and wherever else it may await use. Los Angeles-based Corazonas Foods ( www.corazonas.com ), turned to an increasingly popular solution: creative packaging.\n\"Corazonas uses top-of-the-line moisture and oxygen barriers in our packaging film that delivers the strongest seal available,\" says CEO Ramona Cappello. \"In fact, we have to serrate the edge or notch the film or no one could open the bags! Plus, we nitrogen-flush the bag before sealing to remove oxygen and deliver a great fresh crunch, for up to nine months after packaging.\"\nThe result is a unique, fiber-rich chip \u2014 Beanitos \u2014 that has high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. \"It's hard work to make a bean-based chip that also tastes great,\" says Doug Foreman. \"It took us two years to get the Beanitos formula just right.\"\nCorazonas Foods Inc.'s motto is \"heart-healthy snacks.\" The Los Angeles company debuted a reduced-fat potato chip with plant sterols (CardioAid from ADM) in early 2008. The phytosterols have been clinically proven \"to inhibit the absorption of cholesterol in the small intestine by up to 50 percent, which in turn can lower LDL blood cholesterol by up to 15 percent,\" the company claims.\nThe flavors are novel as well: Italiano Four Cheese, Spicy Rio Habanero, Mediterranean Garlic & Herb, Pacific Rim Barbecue, as well as Slightly Salted. Later came a line of tortilla chips, also with phytosterols, and this year saw the debut of oatmeal squares (cereal bars) with phytosterols.\nEver since George Crum created the ultra thin, crispy, fried potato to spite a critical customer in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in 1853, these chips have been going back to the kitchen for improvement. Michael Season's potato chips are reduced in fat and spiked with Mediterranean flavors with no preservatives, trans fats or saturated fats.\n\"Our customer base is expanding; they are looking for better-for-you snacks,\" says Michael Seasons, president of Natural Snacks LLC ( www.seasonssnacks.com ), Addison, Ill. \"People still want to indulge, but they also want to take the guilt out of snacking. More and more, people are becoming aware of the importance of nutrition and starting with good eating habits. With recent focus on what schools are serving to our children, and our nation's issue with obesity, I believe it [healthy eating] will be the norm.\"\nKeeping it natural\nGetting a healthy savory snack to taste \"just right\" is an R&D project that takes many variables into account. \"The trend overall is to insert as much efficacy as possible into the snack food item without impacting, taste, color or longevity,\" says George Pontiakos president and CEO of BI Nutraceuticals ( www.botanicals.com ), Long Beach, Calif. \"To follow that trend effectively entails meeting numerous technical challenges. For example, probiotics are becoming more popular, so the challenge is maintaining the active component because probiotics tend to be fragile.\"\nCompanies such as Balchem Corp., Danisco and Ganeden Bioetch have developed microencapsulated probiotics that can survive the harsh environments of processing, allowing for their effective use in finished snack products.\n\"We see a lot of interest in antioxidants, too\" Pontiakos continues. To meet demands for a new and functional antioxidant, the company released its Rose-Ox antioxidant product, a highly concentrated carnosic acid ingredient derived from rosemary and uniquely processed.\nAntioxidants from rosemary serve a dual role in savory snacks. They not only preserve and protect from off flavors or rancidity, options exist for them to enhance flavors of savories as well.\n\"Using natural antioxidants in savory snacks can be seen from two different perspectives,\" says Ohad Cohen, CEO of Vitiva ( www.vitiva.eu ), Slovenia. The company makes dual-functionality rosemary extracts, such as Natural AOX, for use in food and beverage products. \"Natural antioxidants can be utilized as processing aid for savory snacks, providing necessary protection for the fat components most savory snacks contain, and extending product shelf life naturally by replacing commonly used synthetic antioxidants. This makes such snacks carriers for natural antioxidants, which also increase the nutritional value, making them value-added, healthier products.\"\nPage 1 of 2\nTo cast your vote, log in or become a member .

Followers of the Paleo diet argue that humans have not evolved to eat agriculture-based foods and can only achieve optimal health by consuming a hunter-gatherer style diet. Thus the Paleo diet is completely devoid of grains and legumes, and also shuns dairy, salt, refined sugar and processed oils. The diet is composed primarily of meats, fish, vegetables, fruits, roots, nuts and seeds.\n(The Wikipedia article on the Paleo diet is actually pretty good if you\u2019d like to read up on the details. I particularly like the Opposing views section.)\nLike most diets the Paleo diet has a little bit of good science behind it, but also a lot of logical leaps and baseless assumptions. The evolutionary argument that humans are somehow maladapted to agriculture-based diets is particularly unconvincing (resting on many unproven assumptions), yet is the fundamental premise on which the Paleo diet bases its recommendations.\nThe reasoning behind the Paleo diet is less interesting to me, however, than the impact of the diet itself. Will \u201ceating like a caveman\u201d really help you be healthier?\nPossibly, but not necessarily.\nThe most obvious advantage of the Paleo diet is the lack of processed foods. There is ample evidence that societies on traditional diets boast far better health than those on modern, Western diets\u2013and the hallmark of modern diets is food processing. Paleo diets therefore are low in sugar, refined carbohydrates, trans fats, excess salt and pretty much everything else that leads to \u201c diseases of civilization .\u201d\nPaleo diets are also abundant in healthy, nutrient-rich foods such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, fish and meats. I have no doubt that anyone willing to stick to a Paleo eating plan will have a healthy weight and remain virtually free of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and may even have lower rates of cancer.\nBut the question still remains, is it necessary to eat Paleo to be healthy?\nThis is where I take issue with the Paleo philosophy. While a diet completely free of processed foods is undeniably healthy, the Paleo diet goes beyond this and demands considerable sacrifice.\nPaleo diets do not allow for any grains or legumes . This pretty much eliminates every traditional cuisine on earth including Japanese, Italian, Indian and Greek. Not only is this a culinary tragedy, it ignores the fact that these cuisines feed some of the world\u2019s healthiest and longest-lived individuals.\nTraditional, global diets that exclude highly processed foods but also\u00a0include grains and legumes have been some of the most successful for health. Diseases of civilization are only problematic in Western cultures where processed foods make up a large proportion of the calories and few whole food are consumed.\nProponents of the Paleo diet argue that it is necessary to eliminate grains and legumes because they contain \u201c antinutrients ,\u201d substances that can interfere with the body\u2019s absorption of other important vitamins, minerals and proteins. However, well-nourished individuals who eat a varied diet of unprocessed foods (including grains and legumes) are not nutrient deficient and are generally healthy.\nGiven that it is possible to thrive on a diet that includes some grains, legumes and even small amounts of processed foods, one must question if giving up the culinary joys of travel and global cuisine are really worth the sacrifice.\nIn my experience, food substitutions and modified recipes designed to mimic traditional meals can sometimes be tasty but can never replace true authenticity.\nAnother contention I have with the Paleo diet is the assumption that the same eating patterns will work for everyone. People\u2019s lives differ in countless ways. We each have different levels of daily activity, demands on our time and food preferences. We also have different genetic backgrounds, which can result in significant differences in metabolism and hormone levels. These individual variations make dietary needs different for each of us.\nBecause of our individual differences, there is undoubtedly a percentage of the population that thrives on the Paleo diet and finds it easy to stick to and achieve results. Hooray! However there may also be a segment of the population ( myself included ) that finds living without grains and legumes to be chronically unsatisfying and unsustainable.\nTry telling a foodie they can never eat cheese or drink wine again and see how far you get pitching a Paleo diet.\nIf you currently eat a typical Western diet with little variety and many processed foods, tend to have better success following rigid diet plans, and have no qualms about giving up or modifying traditional meals to meet your dietary demands, then you might have luck following the Paleo diet. However there is no reason to believe it is the only path to good health.\nThe best diet is the one that works for you. Finding a healthstyle you can embrace and enjoy is essential if you want to build a lifetime of healthy habits.\nDo you follow a Paleo diet? What do you think?\nOriginally published February 22, 2010.\nRelated Articles:\n"}, {"score": 1329.2646, "uuid": "2f75c601-e2a4-503d-9ce4-6ca7f3c0918b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0918wb-20-17700", "target_hostname": "heavenlyhomemakers.com", "target_uri": "http://heavenlyhomemakers.com/how-to-adapt-a-recipe-to-make-it-healthier", "page_rank": 2.847769e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "How <em>to</em> Adapt a Recipe <em>to</em> Make <em>it</em> <em>Healthier</em> | Heavenly Homemakers", "snippet": "<em>To</em> me, <em>healthier</em> means \u201creal, whole <em>food</em>\u201d.

Palm shortening does NOT create the same freaky effects\u00a0from frying that vegetable or canola oils create.\u00a0 This means that\u00a0foods fried\u00a0in palm shortening (or coconut oil ) are NOT unhealthy!\nI use olive oil if a recipe calls for just a few teaspoons or Tablespoons of vegetable oil.\nYou can read more about the fats I prefer and why I prefer them here!!\nSugars\nSucanat (or Rapadura , which is the same thing\u2026just under a different name) can be substituted one for one with white or brown sugar.\u00a0 This means that if a recipe calls for one cup of white sugar\u2026you can instead use one cup of Sucanat .\u00a0 However, I generally cut the Sucanat down just a hair because the flavor is stronger\u2026and because it is more expensive\u2026and because wow\u2026do we really need that much sugar?\u00a0 :) Sucanat , by the way, is dehydrated cane sugar juice and the healthiest form of cane sugar I\u2019ve found. You can read more about it\u00a0 here.\nHoney can be substituted for white or brown sugar, but I usually use 1/2 to 2/3 the amount the recipe calls for.\u00a0 This means that if a recipe calls for one cup of white or brown sugar, I only use 1/2 to 2/3 cup of honey.\u00a0 Honey has a rich flavor and is sweeter than sugar.\u00a0 I have not found that substituting honey causes much difference in the consistency of\u00a0a recipe, even though honey is a liquid and sugar is not.\u00a0 If anything, I find that honey makes quick breads, muffins and cookies more moist\u2026and that\u2019s never a bad thing if you ask me!\nReal Grade B Maple Syrup can be substituted for white or brown sugar, but I don\u2019t often bake with it (ooh, except for Coconut Macaroons !).\u00a0 I use maple syrup for liquid treats like Chocolate Milk and Smoothies and Ice Cream.\u00a0 If a recipe calls for corn syrup, I use Grade B Maple Syrup instead, substituting it one for one.\nYou can read more about the sweeteners I prefer and why I prefer them here!!\nFlours\nI substitute my freshly ground whole wheat flour (made from hard\u00a0white wheat) one for one in recipes that call for white flour.\u00a0 However, freshly ground whole wheat flour is often lighter in texture, making a one to one substitution possible.\nIf you are using store-bought whole wheat flour,\u00a0I find that this seems to be\u00a0a heavier flour .\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0I recommend using a lesser amount than the white flour that is called for in a recipe.\u00a0 You may find that this is even true with my recipes that call for whole wheat flour, since I am using freshly ground flour.\u00a0 I receive quite a few comments, particularly on my Honey Whole Wheat Bread from people using King Arthur\u2019s\u00a0whole wheat flour or another store bought flour that they didn\u2019t need to add in all of the flour the recipe called for.\u00a0 I suggest just adding flour until the dough is the correct consistency\u2026then stop.\nIf you want to soak the whole grain flour to break down the phytates , generally you can substitute a cultured dairy product (or water with lemon juice) for the liquid called for in a recipe\u2026plus add the fat (butter or oil)\u2026and stir these together with the flour for overnight soaking.\u00a0 If you have no idea what I\u2019m talking about when I say \u201c soak the grains \u201c, read this post !\n"}, {"score": 1256.2158, "uuid": "2f7df4d8-27a6-5bb7-9a71-216b25f24e00", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0209wb-10-07048", "target_hostname": "www.ophea.net", "target_uri": "http://www.ophea.net/article/featured/say-goodbye-greasy-fries", "page_rank": 1.182159e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "Say Goodbye <em>to</em> Greasy <em>Fries</em> | Ophea", "snippet": "For many of us, eating healthy <em>is</em> harder <em>than</em> <em>it</em> sounds, especially when temptations abound.", "explanation": null, "document": "Say Goodbye to Greasy Fries\n03/22/2010\nHow Ontario\u2019s New School Food and Beverage Policy is Putting the Healthiest Foods First\nBe honest. Given the option, would you choose a gooey hot fudge sundae or a granola bar? A double cheeseburger or a double helping of green veggies? For many of us, eating healthy is harder than it sounds, especially when temptations abound. But thanks to the January 15, 2010 release of the Ministry of Education\u2019s new School Food and Beverage Policy (PPM 150) making responsible food choices is about to get a lot easier for students across Ontario.\nDeveloped in collaboration with the Ministries of Health Promotion; Children and Youth Services; and Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the new policy embodies the principles of healthy eating outlined in Canada\u2019s Food Guide, and will ensure that 100% of the foods sold on a day-to-day basis in Ontario\u2019s publicly funded schools fall into the categories of \u201cSell Most\u201d and \u201cSell Less\u201d (see definitions below). What this means is that choosing nutritious foods more often won\u2019t only be encouraged, it will become an integral part of every school\u2019s culture\u2014something that we at Ophea could not be happier about.\n\u201cOphea shares the government\u2019s commitment to healthy schools and healthy communities and believes that Ontario\u2019s new School Food and Beverage Policy is a critical step that will reinforce the philosophy and expectations of the revised H&PE curriculum,\u201d comments Chris Markham, Ophea\u2019s executive director and CEO. \u201cIt will foster a healthier learning environment and help students reach their full potential.\u201d\nGood nutrition leads to better health and better learning...\nIt\u2019s simple enough to do the math. With 195 days in a typical school year, Ontario students are eating most of their lunches at school. Whether these lunches are purchased in cafeterias or brought from home and supplemented with snacks from school vending machines, they often include high-fat, high-sugar, high-sodium, low nutrient foods such as fries, candy bars and sugary drinks.\n\"When our school board introduced nutrition standards in 2007, it was because we knew that a healthy diet would lead to more active and engaged students. The results have been outstanding,\" says Roger Lawler, Director of Education at the Waterloo Catholic District School Board.\nAs the link between improved health and improved learning outcomes has been proven time and time again, and the connections between poor nutrition and chronic disease have been well documented, it\u2019s become increasingly clear: poor nutrition is a problem that we, as a society, can no longer afford to ignore, and one that we all have a responsibility not to perpetuate.\nFurthermore, the need to set a strong example for students by \u2018practicing what we preach\u2019 in schools cannot be understated. Through the implementation of Daily Physical Activity (DPA), the forging of community partnerships and the adoption of the Ministry of Education\u2019s Foundations for a Healthy School framework, schools have already begun to take a more comprehensive approach to improving student health. But while positive health messages are taught and physical activity has been made a priority, the foods currently sold in schools often fail to support and reinforce what students are learning about healthy living.\nIt\u2019s time to make a change, and there\u2019s never been a better time to get started! As schools begin to adopt the revised Health and Physical Education Curriculum (Grades 1-8)\u2014which not only provides information about health education but also builds students\u2019 capacity to make healthy choices\u2014the new policy will help to ensure greater alignment between what students are being taught and the food choices that are available, helping them to apply what they\u2019re learning while fostering healthy habits that can last a lifetime.\nThe policy applies to all foods sold in schools...\nThe new policy applies to foods and beverages sold on school premises for school purposes including all venues, such as cafeterias, vending machines and tuck shops. It also applies to all programs (for example, catered lunch programs) and must be enforced at all events, including bake sales and sports competitions.\nExceptions to the policy will include foods and beverages that are: offered in schools at no cost; brought from home or purchased off school premises; available for purchase during field trips off school premises; sold in schools for non-school purposes (e.g., sold by an outside organization using the school gym after school hours and for non school-related events); sold for fundraising activities that occur off school premises; and sold in staff rooms.\nUnder the policy, school principals may also elect to designate up to 10 days (or fewer as determined by the school board) during the school year as \u201cspecial-event days\u201d on which foods and beverages that do not meet the nutrition standards may be sold.\nThe healthiest foods have the highest nutritional values...\nThe policy groups foods and beverages into three categories:\n\u201cThe Sell Most Category\u201d must make up at least 80% of choices offered. These foods and beverages generally have higher levels of essential nutrients and lower levels of fat, sugar and/or sodium. Examples may include fresh, frozen, canned or dried fruits and vegetables; and whole grain breads.\n\u201cThe Sell Less Category\u201d must make up no more than 20% of choices offered. These foods have slightly higher amounts of fat, sugar and/or sodium than the \u2018Sell Most Category.\u2019 Examples may include deli meats, frozen pizza and hotdogs.\nFoods that are in the \u201cNot Permitted for Sale Category\u201d are generally those that contain few or no essential nutrients and high amounts of fat, sugar and/or sodium. Examples include deep fried foods, energy bars and candy.\nMore information about the criteria for determining a food\u2019s suitability can be found in The School Food & Beverage Policy itself.\nWhen it comes to implementation, help is readily available...\nThroughout the winter of 2010, school board teams and principals will receive training from the Ministry of Education in how to implement the new policy, and further information about implementation support can be found at www.ontario.ca/healthyschools .\nAs with any new policy or initiative, getting started is the hardest part. School boards are encouraged to reach out to students, staff, parents, community partners and food service providers in order to gain their support.\nSchool boards should also seek support from their local board of health, as they have been mandated under the Ontario Public Health Standards, 2008 to work with school boards and/or staff in elementary, secondary and post-secondary educational settings, using a comprehensive health promotion approach. The goal of this collaboration is to influence the development and implementation of healthy policies, and the creation or enhancement of supportive environments to address healthy eating and other key health issues (including physical activity, alcohol use and tobacco control). For more information on working with your local board of health, see www.ophea.net/healthy-schools-communities/making-it-happen/step-3 .\nSchools and communities can also access the following sources for further information and for support for healthy eating:\nEat Right Ontario \u2013 This is an initiative of the Ministry of Health Promotion. Through this program, schools (or other interested parties) can access a registered dietician by phone or by email to answer any questions they have about healthy eating. Their website, www.eatrightontario.ca , also contains a wealth of information about diabetes prevention, menu planning, and health and nutrition, as well as a listing of healthy recipes.\nMenu of Choices \u2013 This online resource, published by Ophea, provides the latest quality information and supports to help school communities understand, plan and address healthy eating. The website, www.menuofchoices.ca , which encourages entire school communities to take a proactive approach to addressing the eating behaviours of children and youth (Grades K-12), can be accessed by all educators and community partners who want to help students develop a personal commitment to healthy eating.\nStudent Nutrition Program (SNP) \u2013 This Ministry of Children and Youth Services (MCYS) program supports communities to provide nutritious food to children and youth. The program supports the healthy growth and development of children and youth by providing universal access to nutritious meals and snacks at each site so students are ready to learn.\nSNP is a community-driven initiative. The service delivery model is designed to encourage and facilitate community participation in the development and implementation of the program at the local level so programs can be tailored to meet the individual needs of local children, youth and families. Provincial funding operates within a broader scope of contributors to deliver the program, including parents or caregivers, corporate sponsors, farmers, local charities, community organizations and municipalities.\nThe SNP Nutrition Guidelines follow Canada\u2019s Food Guide and apply to foods served in programs. Guiding principals for the nutrition guidelines include: promote healthy eating, prepare healthy food, respect diversity and individual needs, contribute to social development, choose Ontario food first, be environmentally conscious and practice safe food handling and storage.\nTo learn more about SNP or to download a copy of the SNP Nutrition Guidelines please visit the MCYS website at: www.children.gov.on.ca/htdocs/English/topics/schoolsnacks/index.aspx\nAnother piece of the \u2018Healthy School\u2019 puzzle is falling into place...\nMandatory implementation of the new Food and Beverage Policy is set for September 1, 2011. By the end of the 2010/2011 school year boards will be required to confirm that they will be in full compliance. And while the planning of new menus and food options is sure to be a big job, requiring the support of the entire school community, it is clearly a change that is worth making.\nNot only is the availability of healthy foods in schools bound to result in better eating habits and increased concentration levels for students but, perhaps most importantly, by reinforcing the knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding healthy living that are being taught through the revised Ontario Health and Physical Education Curriculum and encouraged by initiatives such as Foundations for a Healthy School, it is sure to send a strong message to students: Healthy eating habits are important... so important, in fact, that we are willing to work hard to ensure that our school environments support us all in making healthier choices.\n"}, {"score": 1240.6923, "uuid": "cd6e7eaa-4295-5c59-9a68-6b49c73f237d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1602wb-90-36934", "target_hostname": "morethantoast.org", "target_uri": "http://morethantoast.org/tag/food-2/", "page_rank": 1.4429936e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "<em>Food</em> | More <em>Than</em> Toast", "snippet": "More <em>Than</em> Toast <em>is</em> so-called because that&#x27;s all I ate after my baby girl was born.

I don\u2019t like to exercise, I like deep fried stuff and I drink too much wine. Admittedly it\u2019s not the best recipe for weightloss, but I\u2019m persevering with a lot of powerwalking when I go shopping.\nDuring pregnancy I put on three and a half stone. Three of them have been banished but the last 7lbs are proving to be pretty stubborn. My mummy jelly belly is still well and truly in residence and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I am slightly wheat intolerant; there ain\u2019t nothing like my post-pizza bloat. Which is a shame, because I bloody love sandwiches, toast, pasta, cakes\u2026\nI came up with some rules that I wanted to adhere to in order to become healthier, and hopefully slightly smaller-of-tum:\n- Drink lots of water\n- Don\u2019t eat white bread, pizza or pasta (or refined carbs in general)\n- Stay away from deep fried stuff, cheese (esp. deep fried cheese) and chocolate HobNobs\n- Eat three meals a day\n- Allow myself the odd treat and make sure I still enjoy my meals (do not want to lose the will to eat)\nI\u2019ve started keeping a weekly\u00a0visual food diary which has really helped me stop and think about what I eat on a day-to-day basis. What would stop me eating three chocolate HobNobs for breakfast other than having to share that fact with the internet?\nThe first installment is a little odd as there were two days of stomach bug when I didn\u2019t eat or drink anything but water (and briefly lost 4lbs), the day of CyberMummy when I was so busy looking for food I devoured it as soon as I found it, and then there is the small matter of that Burger King I forgot to photograph. There have also been occasions when I\u2019ve tucked into my dinner, completely forgetting to take a picture, so all you get are my leftovers. Soz!\n(L-R: DINNER: Lamb, sweet potato, broad beans and peas, caramalized shallots. BREAKFAST: toast and butter. LUNCH: Avocado and tomato salad with balsamic syrup dressing. DINNER: Roast sweet potatoes, mushrooms and salad. BREAKFAST: toast and jam. LUNCH: Pastrami and chutney salad with gherkins)\n(L-R: Breakfast: Weetabix. LUNCH: Tomato and Onion omelette, avocado salad. DINNER: Lamb Koftes . SNACK: Elfie\u2019s leftovers. DINNER: Gammon with peas and parsley sauce and rosemary roasted new potatoes.

LUNCH: (Cafe Rouge) Starter \u2013 Chicken Liver Pate, Main \u2013 Spicy Sausage baguette with french fries)\nI haven\u2019t \u00a0missed as many breakfasts as it looks here: a lot of the time I tend to grab a banana whilst Elfie\u2019s eating her toast or Weetabix. Obviously my \u2018no refined carbs\u2019 rule isn\u2019t going as well as it could, must try harder in that respect, and I\u2019m amazed that I\u2019ve had two portions of french fries (erm, actually four if you count that burger king and then the cheeseburger I had at The Hoxton on the night of CyberMummy) in a week! Bad. I eat a lot of salad though, huh? +1 diet point for me.\nI will note here that it\u2019s a good thing my wine and Pimms consumption has not been photographed. Nobody\u2019s internet connection is tough enough for all the photos that would necessitate.\nOn the whole, I\u2019d say Diet: 1, Alice: 0. So next week: less white bread. Less fries. Less wine.\nMTT: easy lamb koftes with tzatziki\nFriday, June 10th, 2011\nGreece is very special to our little family. The in-laws lived on the beautiful island of Meganissi for a long time and my father-in-law is buried there so we will continue to return for holidays as often as possible. It\u2019s the least touristy place I\u2019ve ever visited in Greece; the Onassis family own the next-door island and the summer season attracts wealthy Greeks and Italians rather than lager-lout Brits. Don\u2019t tell anyone \u2013 I like to think it\u2019s our secret.\nOne of the best things about Meganissi is the food. Stifados \u2013 fried aubergine \u2013 fish \u2013 salads \u2013 tzatziki. I always come home about 2 stone heavier with a renewed enthusiasm for feta, olives and Greek yoghurt.\nAs I\u2019m still trying to lose the last couple of pounds of baby weight I try not to indulge too much but I recently made the discovery that 0% fat Greek yoghurt pretty much tastes the same as the fattening stuff. So now it\u2019s going on everything; breakfast, posh prawn cocktail, pudding, and my personal favourite: tzatziki.\nThese lamb koftes are super easy to make, healthy and really delicious. Plus, when cooked, they look a little bit like poo. Always good.\nEasy lamb koftes with tzatziki\nServes 2 hungry people\nHandful fresh mint, finely chopped\nHandful fresh parsley, finely chopped\nTeaspoon cinnamon\nHalf a red onion, finely diced\nSalt and pepper\n3 tbsp 0% fat greek yoghurt\n1/4 of a cucumber, finely sliced\nHandful fresh mint, finely chopped\nSalt and pepper\nWraps, to serve\n1. Mix together the mince, herbs, spices, onion and seasoning in a large mixing bowl. I like to use a fork or a knife to break up the meat, but then I get in there with my hands to smoosh it all together.\n2. Yum. Use your hands to make small sausages, about half the size of regular sausages. Put to one side.\n3. I hope your onion was chopped finer than mine. Not very impressive.\n4. In a smaller bowl mix together the remaining mint, cucumber, seasoning and yoghurt. Slice the red onion and put to one side.\n5. Heat half a tbsp in a pan on a medium heat and cook the lamb sausages until browned all over, about 5 minutes on each side.\n6. Make up the wraps with the sausages, yoghurt mixture and sliced red onion. Lettuce optional.\nReview: Maze\nThursday, June 2nd, 2011\n(More poor iPhone photography.

Albert Einstein once stated, \u201cNothing will benefit human health or increase the chances for survival of life on Earth as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.\u201d More than ever, informed consumers are following that advice. People are making conscious decisions to move to a more plant-based diet. A study by the National Restaurant Association shows that 88% of consumers who choose a vegetarian option do so out of concern for health and that 86% do so because of taste. The American Dietetic Association reports an association between vegetarian diets and a reduced risk for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, kidney disease and some forms of cancer. Plant-based diets are naturally low in fat and high in fiber. It\u2019s a powerful combination.\nA common fear when people consider a plant-based diet is one of variety and time. When accustomed to meals of steak, eggs, cheese, frozen and other convenience foods, the transition can seem overwhelming. Challenge yourself to explore the world of foods \u201cas nature made them.\u201d Approach it with an open mind and notice how you feel at the end of a week.\nHere are some tips on making a gradual transition to healthier choices:\nPasta: Replace your regular pasta with soba (buckwheat), Udon, whole wheat or rice noodles. They\u2019re quick to prepare and boost nutrition and fiber.\nBeans: When you can\u2019t cook them from scratch, go for the organic canned variety. Always have them on hand and try tossing them into salads or into pasta or rice. They\u2019re an excellent source of protein and fiber and are packed with healthy nutrients. The types in my cupboard include black, kidney, pinto and garbanzo. If you have these, you always have the foundation for a quick, great meal.\nMeat: With tofu, tempeh and seitan (wheat meat) in the refrigerator you can easily create wonderful soups, sandwiches and stews.\nDairy: \u201cThe human body has no more need for cows\u2019 milk than it does for dogs\u2019 milk, horses\u2019 milk, or giraffes\u2019 milk.\u201d \u2014Michael Klaper, MD. Substitute soy, rice, oat or any of the other plant based varieties. Look for high quality without added sugars or other unnecessary additives.\nGrains: Breads, white rice, white flour and instant oatmeal are not grains. They are grain products and should not be eaten on a regular basis. Try quinoa, whole grain couscous and millet when time is critical. Substitute brown rice for white. All can be topped with beans, meat alternatives and vegetables for a delicious meal.\nFor kids: Try pizza made with whole grain pita, organic pizza sauce, beans or soy cheese and veggies. If they love hot dogs, try the soy variety. Make burger meals the meatless variety with all the fixins\u2019. Bean burritos are usually a big hit as well as noodles with peanut sauce. Dr. Spock said that when we offer children a variety of healthy foods, they develop good eating habits and prefer these foods.\nThe important thing to remember when transitioning to a plant-based diet to make these foods a regular part of daily food choices. Don\u2019t try to convince the family that they must eat them because they are \u201cgood for you.\u201d That usually makes them think that it won\u2019t taste good and that people would never choose these things of their own free will. Try some of these recipes as you transition to a more plant-based diet. They\u2019re healthy, easy to prepare and taste great.\nOTHER RECIPES\n"}, {"score": 1205.9293, "uuid": "4f9faef5-d723-5903-9eca-44a553f9d167", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0704wb-34-25314", "target_hostname": "qualityhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://qualityhealth.com/eating-nutrition-articles/when-it-comes-super-foods-you-super-smart", "page_rank": 1.1749002e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "When <em>It</em> Comes <em>to</em> Super <em>Foods</em>, Are You Super Smart?", "snippet": "Chock-full of vitamin C, carotenoids, potassium, and fiber, this vegetable <em>is</em> as versatile as <em>it</em> <em>is</em> delicious.

Make it a point to include at least a few of these in your diet every day:\nSalmon.\nHigh in omega-3 fatty acids and a preventer of heart disease, salmon and other fatty fish such as halibut and rainbow trout can also help lower blood pressure and enhance brain function.\nSweet potatoes.\nChock-full of vitamin C, carotenoids, potassium, and fiber, this vegetable is as versatile as it is delicious. Slice and pan-fry sweet potatoes as a dinner side dish in place of French fries. Steam it and top with cottage cheese for a filling snack, or mash it and bake it into muffins.\nBroccoli.\nThis cruciferous vegetable deserves more than being an overcooked and overlooked addition to Chinese restaurant menus. Gently steamed, broccoli offers a tasty and colorful complement to any entr\u00e9e or salad.\nBeans.\nNot just for vegetarians, beans are rich in protein, fiber, iron, magnesium, potassium, and zinc. If you're trying to cut down on beef, beans are a great alternative. Mix red beans with rice or toss a handful of chickpeas on a salad. You can also mix cooked black beans into brownie recipes for a creamy nutrition boost.\nAvocados.\nAlthough avocados have more fat than almost any other fruit, it's the heart-healthy, monounsaturated kind. Avocados' natural creaminess and mild flavor mean they're a perfect addition to smoothies, baked goods, and salads.\nNuts.\nLike avocadoes, nuts contain heart-healthy fats that promote good cholesterol. If you're watching your calories, avoid eating them by the handful and instead add small amounts to yogurt or cereal.\nQuinoa.\nThis ancient protein- and fiber-rich grain has become a media darling thanks to its exceptional nutritional profile and gluten-free status. It can substitute for barley or rice in nearly any dish and is loaded with vitamins and minerals.\nMangoes.\nOne cup of mango serves up 100 percent of your daily vitamin C needs, along with a third of your vitamin A and serves a healthy supply of potassium.\nSources:\n"}, {"score": 1180.8613, "uuid": "70e50673-9c06-55b6-97f8-31a163845d6b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-33-07282", "target_hostname": "eatocracy.cnn.com", "target_uri": "http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2012/02/07/55-more-than-one-way-to-fry-a-potato/", "page_rank": 1.1842263e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "How <em>to</em> make french <em>fries</em> - Eatocracy - CNN.com Blogs", "snippet": "Two hours of preparation for french <em>fries</em>?

But in the spirit of the third day of Chanukah, let me share with you my first attempt. I made doughnuts!\nOne of the most important things you need when deep frying is the right pot. (You can also get a deep fryer for relatively cheap if you think you'll be doing this a lot). It needs to be both wide and deep - wide because you can only fry one layer at a time, and deep because you need enough room for a few inches of oil and a couple inches headspace at the top to allow for splashing.\nYou also need a deep-fry/candy thermometer - I got a new one after the demise of my first.\nThe one I got had conveniently labeled temperatures for stages of candy and deep frying.\nMy recipe said 365 F for the drop doughnut, which made them slightly hotter than the 350F that was labeled fries. Doughnuts are way hotter than fries. I knew it.\nThis recipe is really simple. No yeast, no waiting around to rise, no kneading. So with laziness, also comes some sacrifice. This isn't a traditional doughnut, it's more of a cake doughnut. But rolled in glaze, it's just as delicious!\nOnce I dropped them in by teaspoonful (they will expand), the frying began. At first I was worried I would splash hot oil on myself, and even went to change in to long sleeves before beginning, but my fears were unfounded. I just used a spoon to lower the doughnuts into the oil instead of dropping them in. I also had help from my trusty assistants Mom and Shira. [Hi!]\nAnd I watched as they turned a beautiful golden brown. Some of them needed a little help staying below the surface, and I was happy to assist.\nI probably did about ten at a time, plopping them in one by one and waiting for them to get just the right shade of golden brown. Then I pulled them out and let them cool on a paper towel. My assistants and I tried one. Just right.\nNext, of course, I wanted a glaze. I could have just rolled them (still warm) in powdered or granulated sugar, but that just wasn't going to cut it for me. So I mixed up a glaze of confectioner's sugar and milk, adding more liquid or more sugar until I got the consistency I wanted. Then I rolled the cooled doughnuts around, and let them set.\nDoughnuts! But, the deep-fried treats aren't exactly recommended for snacking eight days a week, so if you're looking for a (slightly) healthier alternative, come back on Wednesday for another Chanukah treat.\nTip of the Day: If you're buying a new thermometer, make sure you get one that clips on to the edge of the pot so you don't have to worry about holding it up. And invest in a good slotted spoon to remove the doughnuts from the pot when they're done!\nRecipe:\n"}, {"score": 1174.0085, "uuid": "065e71cb-a448-516f-a3ea-9780c7d6a6a8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0703wb-25-21165", "target_hostname": "www.thereadystore.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thereadystore.com/food-storage/1596/5-food-storage/", "page_rank": 1.1753488e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "5 \u201cMusts\u201d When <em>It</em> Comes <em>to</em> Storing <em>Food</em>", "snippet": "YUMMY, <em>healthier</em>, and much, much quicker&#x2F;efficient <em>than</em> oven baking if your only cooking a few!", "explanation": null, "document": "5 \u201cMusts\u201d When It Comes to Storing Food\n1. How much space will it take up?\nFinding space for food storage is an important consideration.\u00a0 Many mistakenly feel that they don\u2019t have enough space.\u00a0 That would be true if you are buying large bulky buckets and sacks of food.\u00a0 However, if you buy freeze dried food, not only will your food be light, it will also fit in a much smaller space.\u00a0 We package our cases with 6 #10 cans.\u00a0 This allows for a convenient slim box that is stack able.\u00a0 You can fit this box under the bed, or in the closet.\n2. How long is the shelf life?\nIf you are stacking and storing away your food storage, you might be thinking \u201cBut how will I rotate it?\u201d\u00a0 Freeze Dried Food can last for 20-30 years. Most people will never have to rotate it.\u00a0 You can see the dates on the cans that will tell you how much longer your food will last.\u00a0 This will let you store the food and forget about it until that job loss or natural disaster happens.\n3. How difficult is it to prepare?\nImagine you are in a disaster situation.\u00a0 Do you really want to expend your energy grinding wheat and taking hours to prepare your meals?\u00a0 We didn\u2019t think so.\u00a0 With freeze dried food you have have a delicious, nutrient dense meal in minutes.\u00a0 All you have to do is add water.\u00a0 Stir it up, and you are ready to eat.\u00a0 This will also help you conserve your fuel and other energy sources.\n4. Will my family eat it?\nNote: Do not buy food storage that your family will not eat.\u00a0 The food needs to be as close to your normal diet routine as possible so that your family will be able to enjoy it during hard times.\u00a0 It\u2019s essential that everyone gets the right amount of vitamins, minerals and nutrients during and after a disaster.\u00a0 You don\u2019t want unfamiliar food to be a road block in making sure your children are fed properly.\u00a0 Freeze Dried Entrees come in many of the meals you are already eating.\n5. How does it taste?\nLastly,\u00a0 If it doesn\u2019t taste good, you won\u2019t end up eating it (unless it\u2019s the only option).\u00a0 So make sure you only buy food storage that is delicious.\u00a0 One of the main problems you are going to have with Freeze Dried Food is that you won\u2019t want to store it.\u00a0 You will want to eat it instead!\u00a0\u00a0 My family uses it almost every day because it is so easy and it tastes so good.\u00a0 Don\u2019t invest in food storage that you won\u2019t wan to eat!\nContinue reading \u00bb \u00b7 Written on: 10-22-10 \u00b7 28 Comments \u00bb\n28 Responses to \u201c5 \u201cMusts\u201d When It Comes to Storing Food\u201d\nRichard Popovich wrote:\nI disagree with your comments about wheat. Wheat is a valuable part of long term food storage begause of the nutritional value and the ability to store it for extreme periods of time. It is also a very nutritionally dense food. The only down side of wheat is learning how to use it.\nFlour ground from wheat kernals has to be mixed with white flour. Also as with any type of baking, the ingredients need to be measured precisely, or the product will not turn out the way you want it to. I have learned to bake many breads and desserts using our wheat storage, but it has taken time to learn how to do it properly. But now I make white, whole wheat, rye, pumpernickle and a number of variations of German breads and desserts. I give them to friends and neighbors during the holidays and they love them, especially when they are just out of the oven.\nIf people don\u2019t want to go through the learning curve of using wheat in their food supply, freeze dried and dehydrated foods work and store very well. But if someone wants to have a complete food storage program, they need to use and store wheat as well.\nOctober 25th, 2010 at 12:27 am\nSuzanne wrote:\nI have a combination of foods in my storage.\nCanned foods are for shorter-term, simply because they are easy to prepare and aren\u2019t shocking to the system.

They expressed some confidence that the food would always keep coming. Here was my response to all these.\nRE: Storage and food cost. You are preparing for an event that MAY happen. I want you to have the mindset of a person for whom the event HAS happened. Would the costs or storage space be consequential then? No! Besides, the cost is always minimal because storable food is not only insurance but an inflation protected investment. Its not like an insurance premium you pay every year.\nRespecting the likelihood of a shortage, consider the following:\nThe probability is small. But whatever it WAS two years ago has multiplied a hundredfold, a thousandfold or more.\nI could cite reasonably plausible settings where we would have a profound food shortage.\nYou start out with a scenario of millions of families with NO FOOD BACK UP whatsoever, who have absolute confidence in the continued availability of day-to-day food, and a just-in-time (look up term, just-in-time) food supply with little warehouse slack. Throw in a few empty shelves because of fuel shortages or extra consumer demand for home inventory to protect against hyprinflation, and possible shortages. These are, in general, a reduction in confidence, and you have demand far exceeding supply \u2013 for a long time until the population has back up food to relieve their concerns. Increased demand by only 10% of the nation for a six month back up, would overwhelm our supply system.\nHave you ever seen what happens before a blizzard or a hurricane? Its it is usually orderly. But if family preferences change, increasing families\u2019 need for a larger individual backup supply, then that could well create massive runs on the stores. We have never seen our food supply concentrated into such a few places serving so many. That concentration in itself reduces combined food storage on the shelves per person, reducing the safety buffer.\nOctober 25th, 2010 at 5:56 am\nbobk90 wrote:\nMust\u2019s 1 & 2 are the ones that matter!!!\nWhile Must\u2019s 3,4 & 5 are just \u2018Likes\u2019 you want!!!\nHere is Why:\n3.

This recipe comes courtesy of Ms. Paula Deen.\u00a0 I got it out of her July/August issue.\u00a0 I must admit my favorite way to have fries is deep fired, but I do try to eat healthier for the most part.\u00a0 However,\u00a0 I do splurge on occasion.\u00a0 OK, probably more than occasionally, but this was one time I was being healthier.\u00a0 With this recipe, there\u2019s no deep frying, just cookin\u2019 the fries in the oven.\u00a0 I also like this recipe because it jazzes up regular fries with some fun seasoning and sauce.\nNow, if you have ever been in Utah, you know that we all love fry sauce with our fries here.\u00a0 If you aren\u2019t aware of this Utah phenomenon, it\u2019s really quite simple.\u00a0 We Utahans like to dip our fries in fry sauce instead of ketchup.\u00a0 Now, fry sauce is basically a mixture of equal amounts of both ketchup and mayonnaise.\u00a0 There are different variations with seasonings added or things like bbq sauce being used in place of the ketchup, but the basic fry sauce is mayo and ketchup.\u00a0 Now Paula makes a fry sauce to go with these fries, equal amounts mayo and ketchup, but them mixes in some dry ranch dressing mix.\u00a0 Another twist to a Utah classic.\u00a0 The fries also get a sprinkle of the ranch dressing mix too.\u00a0 This is a great combination and a good way to mix up the good old stand by of french fries.\nThe recipe called for extra-crispy fast food french fries.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t find these so I purchased Kroger shoe string fries from my local Smith\u2019s.\u00a0 I also cooked the fries longer than suggested to get them nice and crispy.\u00a0 Still not as wonderful as deep fried french fries, but still good.\u00a0 The whole family loved them.\u00a0 I served them along side the recipe I have for french dip sandwiches .\u00a0 Yummy, delicious, comfort food.\nCrispy Ranch Fries with Fry Sauce\n1 (26 oz.) bag frozen extra crispy fast food fries (I used shoestring fries)\n1 pkg.\u00a0 dry ranch dressing mix, divided\n1/2 cup ketchup\n1/2 cup mayonaise\nMeasure out 1 Tbsp ranch dressing mix and set aside.\nIn a small bow, mix mayo until nice and smooth.\u00a0 Then mix in ketchup and remaining ranch dressing.\u00a0 Put sauce in refrigerator.\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees.\u00a0 Spray a rimmed baking sheet with non-stick spray.\nPlace fries in a single layer on you baking sheet and sprinkle evenly with the 1 Tbsp ranch dressing mix you set aside earlier.\nBake for 11 to 15 minutes (or until you think they are nice and crispy).\u00a0 Serve fries with sauce.\n"}, {"score": 1163.4503, "uuid": "0301a396-9e91-55a2-8c75-5e610acef8c6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1901wb-30-15548", "target_hostname": "www.yummydietfood.com", "target_uri": "http://www.yummydietfood.com/2008/06/yummy-healthier-low-calorie-snack-list.html?fr=hp", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Yummy, Low Calorie Diet <em>Food</em> -- Plus Where <em>to</em> Buy!", "snippet": "When I am craving really bad <em>food</em> (but I don&#x27;t want <em>to</em> eat fat and oil), I sometimes pair these <em>to</em>-die-for wings with french <em>fries</em> (which I <em>bake</em>, you can read about <em>it</em> here).", "explanation": null, "document": "Yummy, Healthier, Low Calorie Snack List\nGrilled Cheese Puffs : On top of being healthy, these organic cheese puffs are a perfect blend of cheese flavor and crunch, making them a really fun and satisfying treat/snack to eat. One portion is only 120 calories, 5 grams of fat, and 1 gram of fiber, and 3 weight watchers points (I know, I wish it was 2, but just not enough fiber). And, they are gluten free!\nLow Calorie Trail Mix : I came across a vegan product called Cocoa Nibs by a company called TerrAmazon at one of my local health food stores (called Country Sun). This trail mix is made primarily with small cocoa nibs, and the flavor I bought has added raisins and coconut that round out the crunch and taste. The cocoa nib mix is definitely a low calorie, healthy, well rounded snack (and trail mix substitute) at only 112 calories per serving, 3 grams of fat, 3 grams of natural fiber, 3 grams of protein, and 2 weight watchers (WW) points.\nHummus and Pita : I eat hummus and pita for lunch all the time on the weekend. My favorite thing to do is to toast the pita so that it gets crunchy. Then I open it up and spread the hummus inside of the pocket. It keeps lunch from being messy, and it warms the hummus which I think is so wonderful! Sometimes I sneak some low fat cheese in there too, to make it more like a sandwich.\nLow Calorie Crepes : I recently found these wonderful crepes in the frozen food section at Whole Foods. Unfortunately, they are a bit expensive, but they are a totally delicious, low calorie food (also low in weight watchers points at only 2 WW points per giant crepe). If you heat them up a bit, you can unfold them and spread them across an entire plate. Then you can put on them whatever you please. I personally like putting my favorite low calorie ice cream on them (half a serving usually).\nBuffalo \"Chicken\" : So, I know you loyal meat eaters out there will be skeptical of this food recommendation, but I highly encourage you to get past the vegan label, and give these chicken-free buffalo wings a try! When I am craving really bad food (but I don't want to eat fat and oil), I sometimes pair these to-die-for wings with french fries (which I bake, you can read about it here). Three of these wings comes in at 2 points, so you can eat two servings of them for 4 points, along with the side of your choice!\nLow Calorie Ice Cream : So, in the spirit of weight watchers, I am always on the lookout for low calorie frozen yogurts and ice creams. I like to stay away from artificial sweeteners and other ingredients I can't understand, so I was quite pleased when I found this Whole Soy and Co brand soy frozen yogurt. I know it is called \"soy frozen yogurt\" but to me, that just means ice cream! I find this stuff to be as yummy as any ice cream I've ever eaten, so to me eating soy frozen yogurt suffices for my ice cream cravings.\nLow Calorie Pistachio Nuts : These yummy little pistachios make for an awesome afternoon snack. They are healthy, filling, fun to eat, and tasty! They come in four different flavors: \"Roasted and Salted,\" \"European Roast,\" \"Salt and Pepper\" (my personal favorite), and \"Roasted No Salt.\" None of the flavors have any added oils or artificial ingredients. A one serving bag at Jamba Juice is 3 weight watchers points.\nLow Calorie Egg Nog : I love drinking egg nog around the holidays. However, not being a huge milk fan, I've bought Soy Nog in the past (which I affectionately refer to as \"Sog\"). Soy Nog is delicious, but it is pretty high in calories, at 90 calories per half cup serving (their label is a bit misleading by having such a small serving size). So, this year, I decided to try to make my own low calorie egg nog (with no artificial sweeteners of course)! And, I am pleased to report that it actually turned out pretty good!\nAlmondina Biscotti-Like Cookies : I recently found these delicious little all natural cookies at Whole Foods called Almondina. My flavor of choice is called \"The Original,\" which is made with almonds and raisins, and has no dairy, added fat, salt or cholesterol. The cookies also come in other flavors like pistachios with almonds, as well as chocolate with almonds. Each cookie is very very thinly sliced and super crunchy. They actually remind me of a cross between an almond muffin, a biscotti (but thinner, with less calories), and a crunchy \"bready\" crouton (one of the many foods I love but usually try to avoid).\nLuna Tea Cakes : A little while ago Luna came out with a lower calorie, yummy, mint chocolate flavored \"tea\" bar I really love called a Luna Tea Cake. This bar is really different than most bars in that it is a bit more like a soft tea flavored cookie with subtle but tasty flavoring, than a dense protein filled bar. I like that the bars contain tea in them, as tea is full of healthy antioxidants. The Mint Chocolate (my personal favorite) and Orange Blossom flavors of the Luna Tea Cake are 130 calories, and only 2 weight watchers points. The other two flavors, berry pomegranate (140 calories) and vanilla macadamia (150 calories) are 3 WW points.\nGone Nuts -Low Calorie Chocolate and Nuts : A company by the name of Living Intentions creates this delicious, gently dried raw mix of cocoa, sprouted almonds and raisins called \"Gone Nuts\" that is really to die for. The vegan and gluten free mix is crunchy and chocolately and even a bit gooey - but in a good way (you can still eat it with your hands without making a mess)! The best part is that the mix is only 103 calories per 28 gram serving, with 4 grams of fat, 2 grams of fiber, and 2 grams of protein (so 2 weight watchers points).\nLow Calorie \"Cheez-It\" Crackers : But alas, the people at Ian's must have realized that there are people like me in the world, because they created little 100 calorie pouches of *organic* and *all natural* cheddar crackers that look and taste just like cheez-its. Technically they are marketed to kids, but I think they are also marketed to those (like me) who have a kid inside of us that wants to eat crackers like these. Plus a picture of cartoon animal on the front of a box never stopped me from eating something. :) A pouch of these crackers is 100 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, 2 grams of fiber, and 2 grams of protein (so 2 weight watchers points).\nLow Calorie Mini Won Tons : I absolutely love Indian Food , sometimes a little too much. So, I'm always on the lookout for low calorie Indian options at the store. When I saw some low calorie organic Vegetarian Indian Curry flavored won tons (aka mini-pot stickers) at Whole Foods, I just had to try them! Making them was really quick and easy and they came out crispy and delicious. In fact, the flavor and consistency really reminded me of samosas that you can get at Indian restaurants. Even better, these little vegan won-tons are low calorie! Six of them (55 grams) is 80 calories, 1.5 grams of fat, 3 grams of protein, and 1 gram of fiber (or 2 weight watchers points).\nGoRaw Live Super Cookies : I'm a big fan of raw food, even though I'm not a vegan or a raw foodie. There are two reasons why I like it: (1) it is healthy since it is not processed at all and is made from foods that occur in nature, and (2) it really fills me up, way more than non-raw foods. I'm not exaggerating about the full thing, I think raw food makes me about twice as full as non-raw food. If I were more disciplined I'd eat it all of the time. A bit ago I discovered some pretty tasty chocolate flavored raw super cookies made by a company called goraw. The full ingredient list is: organic coconut (unsulphered), sprouted organic sesame seeds, organic date, raw organic agave nectar, and raw organic cocoa.\nLow Calorie Apple Pie Toaster Pops : Amy delivers great taste and a wonderful breakfast through her organic, vegan, Toaster Pops that taste so good (the outside is like pie crust, the inside is like apple pie filling) it is difficult to believe that each one only has 150 calories! Each Toaster Pop is 3 WW points (a bit of a bigger weekday breakfast for me, without going crazy), and is well balanced with whole wheat ingredients, real organic apples, and only 3.5 g of fat, 6g of sugar, and 4g of protein.\nTrader Joes Chocolate Wedges : A few years ago, I discovered these amazing chocolate wedges called \"The Chocolate Traveler\" at my local Trader Joes (with amazing nutritional info). These one-serving sized chocolate wedges are a gift to those of us who love chocolate, but strive to eat it in moderation. Each wedge is a bit over 30 calories (1 WW point), and is big enough to satisfy your chocolate or sweet craving. I have a deal with myself where I only eat one a day.\nFage Yogurt : Do you love thick, creamy, yogurt? If the answer is yes, you have to try Fage! It is one of the thickest, most creamiest, healthy desserts / low calorie snacks that exists (that I have found). Fage yogurt comes in different varieties. My favorite (for dieting) is the 0%, which provides a whopping 5.3 ounces of creamy delight for merely 80 calories (2 WW points if you eat the entire serving). Fage also comes in a 2% variety (make sure you purchase the one with the calories you desire), which you can buy packaged with small sides of fruit, or a point more.\nLesser Evil Flavored Popcorn : For most people dieting or trying to eat healthy, popcorn is a great snack, but usually not flavored popcorn. In fact, as a kid, I used to love eating candied popcorn, but as an adult trying to eat healthy and watch my weight, I didn't think I would ever be able to eat anything like it again. That was, until I spotted \"Lesser Evil\" (meaning it does not have \"evil\" ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, artificial stuff, or hydrogenated oils) popcorn in the chips and popcorn aisle at Whole Foods. Lesser Evil was right on target for me, with only 120 calories & 2 WW points for all 4 flavors (although the peanut butter flavor serving is slightly smaller in volume -- see shopping tip below), per 30 gram serving. Yay!\nCocoa Berries : Inside the box are very decently sized dark chocolate candies (made from Guittard chocolate) with fresh, ripe, freeze dried blueberries inside of them. You can also buy them filled with fresh freeze dried strawberries instead of blueberries, which I imagine are also really tasty! The Cocoa Berries are not overly crunchy on the inside -- they have a very light crunch and a perfect amount of fruit flavor which makes them interesting (and not chewy), without overpowering the chocolate taste or consistency.\nFunky Monkey Freeze Dried Fruit : We all know that we are supposed to integrate several servings of fruits and vegetables into our diets every day. I personally love fruit (and I guess I also like some vegetables), but unfortunately I have found that it is not always easy to carry fruit with me when I am on the go. Dried fruit is definitely more portable, so I'm always on the lookout for interesting dried fruit options at the store. Funky Monkey distinguishes itself from many dried fruit options in two important ways: (1) the fruit has no added sugar so it is low calorie, and (2) the fruit is combined with other natural flavors (like cinnamon, lime juice, acai) that make it extremely yummy!\nLow Calorie Gluten Free Donuts : You are probably wondering how big the donuts are. I'd say they are a pretty good size (not too big, not too small -- 45g to be exact). What is interesting about them is how dense they are. One donut is way more filling than 2 of the vans waffles I usually eat. Also, when I eat a donut, I automatically feel like I ate something bad (even if it wasn't), so I find that I tend to be less tempted by other things after I eat one. So, if you are looking for a lower calorie donut or have been looking for a gluten or wheat free donut substitute, these are definitely worth a try. They definitely aren't healthy compared to many other food options, but I think they are a fun and yummy indulgence for every once in a while.\nPizza Munchees : If you cook these pizza munchees in your oven (I've yet to try the microwave), what results is a crispy shell that is reminiscent in taste to the outside of mozzarella stick appetizers that you get at Italian restaurants. Amazingly, *six* of these pizza munchees (which are a bit larger than they look on the package) come in at 180 calories, with 5 grams of fat, and 2 grams of fiber (4 weight watchers points) making them a great low calorie lunch option . If you are looking to decrease the calories and eat them as a snack, you can eat five munchees for 150 calories (3 WW points), four for 120 calories (2 WW points), or two munchees for 60 calories (1 WW point).\nWasabi Peas : Wasabi Peas are commonly found in bars and at parties, but what you might not know about them is that they actually make a pretty smart, low calorie snack. What I personally love about them is how incredibly spicy and wasabi-y they are (I love Japanese food!). They also have tons of crunch which, as you know, is something I look for. Another great thing about wasabi peas is that they are very difficult to overeat because of their extremely strong wasabi flavor. Not only can you only eat one or two at a time, but they are also *not* the kind of snack where you will accidentally eat the whole bag (the spiciness would make most people sick).\nYotta Bar : Yottabar is a \"granola\" snack bar that contains 1 serving of both my fruits and my vegetables, which makes me feel happy about eating it. It also doesn't contain anything \"bad\" like High Fructose Corn Syrup, something I try to avoid. My favorite flavor is cherry, followed quickly by orange. They have other flavors as well.\nKashi Low Calorie Cereal : I love many of the Kashi products, including many of the different Kashi cereals. But, this cereal is very special, because it is only 70 calories per 1 cup serving. Yes, one entire cup! Almost hard to believe! I love this stuff. When I pair this cereal with half a cup of almond milk (20 calories), I end up with a very low calorie meal (90 calories/2 points) that keeps me pretty full and gets me all the way to lunch most of the time.\nBaked French Fries : First, start by buying frozen french fries in the freezer section of any supermarket (Safeway makes my favorite kind). Then, instead of putting them in the deep fryer, you bake them in the oven on very high heat. I personally like my french fries really crispy, so I bake them for a long time, sometimes even broiling them at the end to make them crispy. And, even better, you can usually eat a good portion of fries (like 20) for 120 calories, or 2 WW points. Not too shabby!\n40 Calorie Almond Milk : This stuff is amazing!! It is only 40 calories a cup (1 point for WW diet). Sometimes I put it in cereal, or smoothies, and sometimes I just drink it plain with some nutmeg, like eggnog. I highly, highly recommend this to anyone who is dieting. They also have a \"sweet\" version, around 60 calories or so. I like to stick with this one, though, since it is so low calorie.\nBaked Chips : Baked chips are a big staple for me. They don't taste low calorie and certainly don't seem like diet food. They come in all sorts of varieties and flavors, and eating them doesn't seem like a compromise. I highly recommend Baked Lays, although there are a lot of potato chips out there that are 130 or less calories per serving, with fiber and protein. A great place to look at chips is at Whole Foods.\nBanana Puffet : My favorite is the banana puffet (featured to your left), which is more \"desserty\", but the company makes other types as well that could substitute as a side for one of your meals (like the \"Eat Your Greens Puffet\" or \"Carrot Risotto Puffet\"). The Banana Puffet is only 2 points, with 2 points of fiber.\nClif Z Bars : The Clif \"Kid\" Z Bar is one of my most favorite snack bars. It is very healthy -- it is organic, whole grain, has fiber, and has no artificial ingredients. It is also quite yummy, and filling. It is a great snack. They come in an array of flavors (in order from my favorite to least favorite): Chocolate Chip, Honey Graham, Peanut Butter, Brownie, Blueberry, and Apple Cinnamon. They are super cheap (maybe because they target kids instead of dieters), and they are available for $.49/each at my local Whole Foods.\nFiberful Bars : I was thrilled when I came across these super-delicious fiber-enriched fruit bars at Trader Joe's, which, with 60 calories and 6 grams of fiber, cost 0 WW points to eat! These fruit leathers are quite big in size (20g), and they come in a wide variety of tasty flavors such as apricot, mixed berry (my personal favorite), boysenberry, and strawberry. Sometimes I'll eat one of these fruity treats before I go out to a restaurant to curb my hunger, which makes me less tempted to order something really bad for my diet when dining out.\nSteel Cut Oatmeal : Trader Joe's Steelcut Oatmeal is a great alternative to preparing steel cut oats on your own, for those of you that are busy or don't like to cook (if you do, you should totally try making your own steel cut oatmeal straight from the oats). Inside the box are two pre-sized portions of brown sugar and maple syrup flavored oatmeal that you just place into a bowl and microwave to prepare. The portion size is very large and filling, and due to all the fiber, it is only 2 WW points (150 calories)!\nIan's Low Calorie Cookie Butons : I recently came across Ian's Cookie Buttons at my local Whole Foods. They are similar to 100 calorie packs, in that they come in little one-serving packages that are actually made for kids. These cookies buttons are a much better alternative to many of the other 100 calorie cookie packs on the market since they are made from non-bleached flour (wheat flour in the case of the Chocolate Chip and Double Chocolate Chip Flavors), and do NOT contain any refined sugars.\nLow Calorie Samosas : The trick to keeping these samosas low calorie is to *not* follow the directions on the box which suggest that you deep fry them. Instead, heat up a pan with a teaspoon of oil (if you do this, make sure you count the points), or a tablespoon or two of water, or just a non-stick cooking spray like Pam, and pan fry them rather than deep frying them. Alternatively, you could put them in the oven and bake them.\nLow Calorie Turkey Pepperoni : Since pepperoni derives its flavor from the spices and not the mystery meat it's made of, the turkey version tastes exactly the same as any other pepperoni. As you can see from the picture, however, it has 70% less fat than regular pepperoni. That adds up to 50% fewer calories per serving.\nBanana Smoothie : So today I thought I'd share with you my first recipe. It only has a few ingredients, but that doesn't mean it isn't super yummy. Use the recipe to make a low calorie, healthy, banana smoothie that doesn't require any mixes, anything unnatural, or anything artificial.\nDried Fruit : In general, dried fruits are a great choice when it comes to snacking. They are tasty (very sweet if you like sweet things) and they still contain fiber and nutrients. They are much better than reaching for something starchy like a bagel, or some of the other items you might find in an average vending machine. Sensible foods makes wonderful pouches of dried fruit that make a great filling & healthy snack, without costing you tons of calories.\nChocolate Goji : So, having never tried Goji Berries, I was quite intrigued when I found this package of \"Chocolate Goji Treats\" made by Superfood Snacks when I was shopping at Whole Foods. Inside the bag are \"nuggets\" that not only contain cocoa powder and Goji Berries, but also contain other raw and natural ingredients like raisins, coconut (which I absolutely love!!!), and sesame seeds. Each Goji treat looks a like coconut covered date (both in shape and in size).\nBarbara's Low Calorie Cereal : There are two reasons why I love cereal. The first reason is that I think it makes for a super yummy, healthy, and filling breakfast (or even lunch sometimes) when combined with low calorie almond milk and some frozen fruit or frozen bananas (for only 3-4 WW points depending on which cereal variety you pick). Secondly, I love it because it makes a great (and crunchy!) 2 WW point snack -- and there are so many different healthy varieties of cereal on the market that it never gets old!\nYummy, Fresh, Low Calorie Salsa : I love salsa! Not only is it low calorie and good for you, it is also great with baked chips (super yum!), on quesadillas, soft tacos, eggs, etc. There are really countless ways to incorporate salsa into your meals and snacks. In a personal quest to find the perfect salsa, I tried making my own salsa several times, but unfortunately, I never created a salsa that I really loved. Then, I discovered a really yummy homemade-like salsa at a friend's bbq that turned out to be Casa Sanchez' Salsa Roja.\nJulie's Ice Cream Sandwiches : Julie's ice cream sandwiches are different, and different in many good ways! Not only are they very low in calorie (100 calories/sandwich or 2 WW points), they are also made with real, ice cream! Yes, I did say real ice cream -- made with all natural ingredients, so for those of you that don't like soy ice cream or low calorie frozen yogurt , you will find that they are tasty, creamy, rich and yummy beyond belief.\nHint Flavored Water : If you are too busy to make your own naturally flavored water, I have to say Hint water is a very close substitute. The fruit flavor is very subtle, but yummy enough to help me easily drink my 8 cups of water per day. I really like drinking Hint water when it is refrigerated versus warm. Hint water comes in a ton of flavors (you can check out the Hint website to see a complete list) of which my personal favorites are pear and strawberry kiwi.\nGnu Bars : In particular I really like the chocolate brownie flavor, and I absolutely love the banana walnut flavor (reminds me of banana bread - another food I don't get to eat as often as I would like). As with most of the foods I blog about, these bars are not only super tasty but they contain good ingredients -- full of fiber, whole wheat flower, no artificial flavors, no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup, which always puts a smile on my face.\nPotato Rondelet : A friend of mine recently turned me onto Potato Gratin Rondelets, a french version of potatoes and low calorie cheese , made by Whole Kitchen. A big fan of both potatoes and cheese, I have to say, she didn't have to do a lot of work to convince me to try them, especially once she told me that they are only 100 calories each (or 2 WW points). These potato rondelets (I personally like to call them potato domes) are delicious. Each one is somewhat petite, but is definitely big enough as a side dish, or would make a great snack, if you were having a potato craving.\nFigamajigs : he Figamajig bars come in a few flavors: dark chocolate covered fig (2 WW points, 130 calories), dark chocolate covered mint (2 WW points, 130 calories), dark chocolate covered raspberry (2 WW points, 130 calories), and dark chocolate covered almond bar (3 WW points, 150 calories). My personal favorite is the plain one. These figs and chocolate give the bars such a strong taste that the extra flavoring isn't really needed to make them yummy (although the flavored ones are really good, and the crunch in the almond one is nice!).\nSushi : Sushi can definitely be difficult to navigate when you are on a diet or watching your calorie intake, since there are so many different kinds of ingredients that can be in a roll. But, it shouldn't be all-out avoided, since many rolls are made with healthy ingredients that are actually good for you (like avocado, seaweed, cucumber, fish). It is all about your choices. With that in mind, I put together some sushi eating tips, staring with a special tip just for those of you out there that don't eat fish.\nBaked Krisps : I've tried some of the other \"better for me\" chips and crackers that are out there in the past, which I've liked for the most part, but these krisps are different both in taste and consistency. First of all, they are very thin and crunchy not thick and rice-y like many low calorie rice crackers/chips that are on the market today (you can kind of see the difference from the picture). Second of all, the flavoring is really yummy, and done well enough to fill that Sour Cream and Onion craving that I just can't avoid sometimes.\nLow Calorie Whole Wheat Tortilla : I've been eating La Tortilla Factory high fiber tortillas for a long time. They are a great bread substitution, and also work well for making quesadillas (with fat free cheese, salsa , fat-free sour cream -- super yum!), burritos, soft tacos, egg sandwiches, low calorie pizza , and more.\nLow Calorie Potato Pancakes : I don't have words to describe how much I enjoy eating these Golden brand Potato Pancakes. They are unbelievable amazing and are only 1-2 WW points (70 calories each, right on the edge between 1 and 2 points). After you heat them up (I've heated them both in the microwave and in a pan with PAM), you can put some fat free sour cream on them for only a small amount of added calories.\nFrozen Fruit : There are tons of different frozen fruits available at the supermarket (and you can also make your own at home). My personal favorite is frozen cherries because they come without pits and ready to eat (they also taste *amazingly* good). In addition to cherries, I am also a big fan of frozen mango, frozen blueberries, as well as frozen bananas .\nSoy Nuts : So, soy nuts can definitely be yummy, although they aren't quite as fulfilling as eating peanuts (they are much lighter in weight which is why a serving is so much bigger, and they aren't as flavorful, so I would not eat them alone). But, I've found they work really well as a substitute for some purposes!\nSpicy Boca Chicken : I think Boca Spicy Chicken (\"Chick'n\") Patties are delicious, and their high level of protein (11g per serving) is just an added bonus to something that I already enjoy eating. As you might be imagining, these patties are a great low-fat substitute to fried chicken. The fun thing about them is that there are so many things you can do with them, as they make such a great low calorie lunch option !\nLow Fat Cheese : Dieting and eating low calorie doesn't mean you have to give up cheese! Cheese and other dairy products are great sources of calcium as well as protein so it is great if you can find a way to incorporate low fat dairy into your diet. As you probably know there are many low fat and non-fat milk substitutes that you can purchase at your local supermarket. What you might know know is that: (1) some low fat dairy products taste better than others, (2) some low fat dairy products contain undesirable ingredients so it is important to read nutrition labels carefully, and (3) cooking with low fat dairy can be tricky.\nSweet Herbal Tea : Drinking tea is a great idea, but not when you feel like you need to add tons of sugar to make it tasty. That is why I personally love Good Earth's Sweet and Spicy Herbal Tea (note, it comes in a non-herbal version as well, so make sure you buy the right one). This tea is the yummiest, sweetest tasting unsweetened tea I've ever had. It's made from a flavorful Rooibos base, has no caffeine (unless you buy the caffeine version), contains natural antioxidants, and has a strong, sweet, cinnamon taste.\nVitamin Drink : A few months ago I came across Zenergize Vitamin Boost tablets at my local Whole Foods. They were a bit expensive, but I decided to try them anyway since I figured they might taste good, and they might help me drink more water (and even get more vitamins) during the day. I have to say, they beat my expectations! At only 2 calories per tablet (0 weight watchers points goes without saying), with 0 g sugar, and all natural ingredients, they have a lot going for them! On top of that, what is really nice about these tablets is how potent they are.\nAttune Probiotic Bars : Attune chocolate bars taste a lot like regular candy bars, in fact they are a close substitute to a Nestle's crunch bar. Unfortunately for us, each bar is more petite than a Nestle's crunch, but the Attune bars are still an impressive, filling size, especially considering how yummy they are. The Attune chocolate bars come in 4 delicious all-natural, gluten-free flavors: Chocolate Crisp, Dark Chocolate (my personal favorite, which is also vegan by the way), Mint Chocolate, and Blueberry Vanilla (made with delicious White Chocolate).\nTortilla Chips : One of my favorite kinds of these chips is made by Whole Foods (365 is the brand). The chips are all natural, large and ready to be dipped in yummy salsa, like at a restaurant, and best of all, they taste authentic (I think it is because they are made with stone ground whole white corn -- at least that is what the bag says). The kind I buy are only \"Lightly Salted\" (50mg of sodium per serving) which is actually kind of hard to believe because they taste so good, even when I don't dip them in salsa or put anything on them.\nJulie's Sorbet Bars : Julie's Sorbet bars are organic, non-fat, cholesterol free, made from real fruit, and one bar is only 60 calories (coming out to 1 weight watchers point). They taste like you're eating fruity ice cream, which is impressive considering that are completely non-dairy. Julie's Organic Sorbet Bars make the perfect yummy low-calorie dessert, especially at the end of the day after dinner when you're craving something sweet or fruity, but can't afford to eat many more calories.\nPacific Low Calorie Almond Milk : The 35 calorie milk I bought from Pacific isn't as strongly vanilla flavored as the almond breeze I am used to drinking, and therefore not quite as tasty. But I see online that Pacific has a vanilla unsweetened flavor as well (at 40 calories), so I'm going to start looking for that at all my local supermarkets. For now, I have a lot of the non-vanilla kind, so I'm adding a bit of vanilla extract and nutmeg (and sometimes cinnamon) to sweeten it up and make it more flavorful.\nEdamame : I love eating edamame (it is high in protein, as well as vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium and iron), although I usually avoid ordering it as an appetizer at a Japanese restaurant because it is so expensive. The price is really pretty ridiculous considering how easy it is to buy and make edamame on your own at home! Also, when you make edamame at home, you can control the salt content, which is a huge added benefit to anyone watching their salt intake. So, you might be wondering, how do you make edamame at home?\nFiber Muffins : Although they look like muffins to me, Zen Bakery calls these fabulous, high fiber blueberry muffins by the name of \"fiber cakes\". Perhaps it is because each one contains a whopping 13g of natural fiber which makes them incredibly filling despite their somewhat petite size (they really aren't that small, but compared to the muffins you'd buy at a bakery, they are somewhat small).\nIzze Esque : spotted something called Izze Esque, sitting close to the regular Izze sparkling juice I always craved but never bought. Izze Esque was all good news -- a 60 calorie (40 calories per 8 ounce) serving of the same kind of sparkling juice, made by the same company that cares so much about keeping its products all natural. After buying some, I found that I like Izze Esque just as much as I liked the full calorie Izze flavor. I'm not really sure how the Izze people pulled off the delicious taste without adding anything artificial, but they did!\nO'Coco Chocolate Crips : I have to admit, I'm really impressed with these crackers. I never realized it until I ate them, but they actually satisfy two of my cravings: (1) chocolate and (2) crunch, and with only 90 calories (2 weight watchers points) in a pre-portioned bag, I have to say, they are right up my alley and they make a great low cal snack food. The crisps are not only delicious, light, and crunchy but they are also all-natural, organic, and hydrogenated oil free.\nCoconut Milk Yogurt : So recently I was perusing the yogurt section of Whole Foods, hoping to mix up my yogurt selection a bit, and an all natural Coconut milk yogurt caught my eye (made by Turtle Mountain). I was intrigued since I absolutely love the taste of coconut, but it is yet another food that that I have found difficult to integrate into my low calorie diet. I was also interested in this yogurt since I go through phases where I avoid dairy, and as much as I enjoy soy products, I always think it is interesting to explore non-soy alternatives to dairy as well.\nFrozen Bananas : When people think about freezing fruit, they often think about frozen blueberries, frozen cherries, frozen strawberries, etc. (all super yummy and great for your health/diet), but today I wanted to write about another type of frozen fruit -- frozen bananas! Bananas are my favorite fruit and freezing them makes them even better (and sweeter). In this post, I've answered a few questions you might have.\nHuuraw Vegetable Chips : I recently discovered some completely raw chips in the \"extremely natural foods\" aisle at Whole Foods. They looked interesting so I turned them over and was overjoyed by the calorie information -- 1 oz (28g) of chips for 40 calories, 2.5g of fat, and 2g of fiber! So, basically, one serving of these chips is only 1 weight watchers point (and extremely low in calories) vs. tortilla chips which are usually 2-3 WW points for the same size serving. It is amazing what happens when you don't add oil to a food to prepare it!\nEnglish Muffins : I've always loved English muffins as a kid, but I've steered clear of them through many years of dieting and watching my weight, because I always assumed they were high calorie like other white colored breads that I knew I needed to avoid. But, I recently rediscovered them (ironically they were in my refrigerator because someone I live with eats them a lot), when I happened to see the nutritional information on the back of the box. Now, maybe you all already knew this, but English Muffins are totally within reason calorie-wise and if you choose carefully, you can even eat ones that are actually pretty good for your health and your diet.\nFruitabu : The smooshed bars have no added sugar, are each half a serving of fruit, and come in several yummy flavors including apple, apricot, grape, raspberry, and strawberry. What is great about these bars vs. the fiberful bars is that they have less calories (the smooshed bars are 40 calories vs. the 60 calories in the fiberful bars). However, because the fiberful bars have added fiber, they come out to be 0 weight watchers points, whereas these bars are 1 WW point.\nKrinkle Sticks : I was thrilled to find that the krinkle sticks are very low in calorie like their popcorn counterparts, coming in at only 110 calories per 1 cup serving (aka 2 weight watchers points), which is awesome! As for the taste -- they turned out pretty good. They remind me of a cross between a very crunchy well-seasoned french fry, and a baked chip, both foods that I really like. The krinkle sticks also come in a classic sea salt flavor (which I imagine is more french fry like) and a bar-b-q flavor as well. If you've tried them, I'd love to hear what you thought of them!\nDagoba Dark Chocolate Tasting Squares : I happened to see a small Dagoba chocolate bar over by the checkout counter called a Dagoba tasting square (note: it was not with the Dagoba bars in the chocolate aisle). The one I bought (and have continued to buy) is called \"Pacuare\" and has 68% cocoa content, combined with sugar, cocoa butter, and soy lecithin (and is gluten-free). Although the Dagoba Tasting Square does not have calorie information, the bar is labeled as being 9g (~50% bigger than the Trader Joes chocolate wedge). And, the tasting chocolate bar is totally delicious, just as I would have expected based on the other Dagoba chocolates I had eaten.\nDreyers Frozen Fruit Bars : Enamored with the coconut bar, I've since tried some of the other flavors, including strawberry and orange cream -- all worth exploring. Like with the coconut bar, I found these bars to be quite satisfying because of the effect of their thickness and real fruit content on their flavor and texture. Dreyers also makes other flavors, namely grape, lemonade, lime, tangerine and strawberry-banana smoothie.\nAmy's Steel Cut Oatmeal : As I mentioned previously, steel-cut oatmeal is delicious and filling, but very time consuming to make. Like with the Trader Joe's version, Amy has created a pre-made frozen version of the oatmeal which you can conveniently make on your own. The serving size is really filling (255g) and the oatmeal is quite tasty. In terms of nutrtition, the oatmeal is dairy free, all natural, and has 220 calories, 3.5 grams of fat, and 5 grams of fiber (so 4 weight watchers points).\nGo Raw Banana Bread Bar : If the banana bar looks big in the picture, it is because it is quite large and flat (1.2 oz), and amazingly filling at only 120 calories (and 2 weight watchers points). The only ingredients in the bar are sprouted organic flax seeds, organic banana, organic unsulphured coconut, and organic dates, which contribute to its 5 grams of fiber, 4 grams of protein and 5 grams of fat. The label boasts that this bar is wheat free, gluten free, cholesterol free, has no added sugar, was made by hand, uses no GMOs and is 100% organic, so clearly it has a lot going for it.\nPopovers : After I left home to go to college, I went many years without coming across a popover, until I discovered a fantastic, healthy, easy-to-make (with only four ingredients which is ideal for me since I'm not a skilled cook) recipe for making popovers in a friend's Betty Crocker Cookbook. This popover recipe (which is now available online) not only helps me make delicious popovers, but each one only has 100 calories and 1 gram of fat (2 weight watchers points total).\nLow Calorie Granola : I later found a granola (on the lowest shelf just as I was about to give up) by a company called Enjoy Life, a brand known for their gluten free foods. Although I had never tried their products before, I decided to buy the Cinnamon Crunch flavor which had 160 calories (with 5 grams of fiber, and 3 grams of protein) for a half a cup serving -- 3 weight watchers points for a whole serving, but only 1 WW point for half a serving. This was one of the lowest calorie and lowest fat granolas I found, so I decided to try it and take it home for a taste test.\nApples : So, why are apples so good for us? Well, there are many reasons! What I learned in the article is that apples are a great source of fiber in the form of pectin, as well as a great source of antioxidants. The fiber helps cleanse our bowels and encourages good colon heath. Apples are also believed to help lower your bad cholesterol, reduce the risk of cancer, slow down our aging (my favorite benefit!) by lessening the effects of stress, diabetes, and heart disease, and help prevent hair loss.\nNada Moo Ice Cream : I recently found another delicious lower calorie ice cream substitute at Whole Foods called Nada Moo. This ice cream is unique from other low calorie ice creams and low calorie frozen yogurts I've found, as it is made from coconut milk and brown rice milk, so it is not soy based and it is dairy free (note: the label has a disclaimer that says it contains soy within its ingredients, but because the ice cream is not soy based, it does not have that soy taste that some people abhor). One of my favorite parts of this ice cream is its subtle coconut taste, even in the non-coconut flavors.\nLow Calorie \"Rice Krispies\" Cereal : The crispy rice cereal made by Erewhon is made entirely from brown rice (not even processed into flour), barley malt, and sea salt and is organic, 100% whole grain, wheat free, and fat free -- with only 1 gram of sugar. It is also only 110 calories per giant 30 gram serving (the serving is huge since each of the puffed rice crisps is full of air!). This cereal is exactly like rice krispies which I loved as a child, just a little less sweet, which is a-ok with me.\nGoldenberries : Have you ever heard of a goldenberry? Well, goldenberries are apparently a \"superfruit\" that hail from South America. From what I've read they appear to be very healthy - with a high vitamin A content. They are rich in bioflavonoids, which help reduce inflammation in the body. They also contain a high level of vitamin A, vitamin C, beta-carotene, vitamin P, as well as some iron. In case you are wondering, vitamin P (sometimes known as rutin) is believed to strengthen the circulatory system in addition to helping with vitamin C absorption.\nLow Calorie Banana Bread : A wonderful, delicious, wholesome low calorie banana bread recipe created by a fellow blogger! Each piece is only 60 calories, 1 gram of fat, and 1 gram of fiber (so 1 weight watchers point). There are tons of great ways to eat this bread as well!\nMint Water : If you like mint (and I mean if you *really* *really* like the taste of mint), and you are looking for a way to drink flavored water (without added sweeteners or calories), then you might want to try Metromint waters. I discovered Metromint waters one day when I was really thirsty while shopping at Whole Foods. When I saw that the water had 0 calories, was all natural, and was available in a *chocolate mint* flavor, I just had to try it. I had never tasted chocolate flavored water before!\nKind Bars : Luckily, there is one flavor of the Kind bar that I've discovered called \"Walnut and Date\" that is less calories than the others -- with only 150 calories, 7 grams of fat, 3 grams of fiber and 2 grams of protein per bar - so 3 weight watchers points. It is also *very* delicious (just not my favorite since the other one has coconut). The \"Walnut and Date\" bar also has a lot going for it -- it is all natural, dairy free, gluten free, and wheat free. I'm a nut lover, and I think this bar is the perfect blend of walnuts (one of the best nuts you can eat), dates and honey. It is both sweet and nutty at the same time!\nFigamajigs Bite Sized Candies : A company called Figamajigs not only makes yummy chocolate fig bars (which I blogged about previously), but they also make a pretty low calorie fig candy that is a great, all-natural, healthier substitute for candies like M&Ms. These figamajigs candies come in a few flavors, some candy coated, some not, including: dark chocolate, dark chocolate with candy coating, mint flavor, and mint flavor with candy coating. My favorite by far is the mint flavored candy coated (which is pictured)!\nGreen Superfood : The low down on all-organic green superfood is that one serving has the antioxidant equivalent to seven servings of fruits and vegetables. Inside of each serving is a blend of four powders: (1) Green Foods (things like grass, alfalfa, spinach), (2) Antioxidants (acai, carrot, beet, green tea), (3) Fiber (flax seed powder, apple pectin fiber), and (4) Digestive Enzymes & Probiotics (acidophilus , chicory root). These blends contribute to a packet of green powder that has 100% of your daily vitamin A (great for your skin), 40% of your daily vitamin C, 50% of your vitamin K, as well as large amounts of other vitamins as well.\nWildwood Past Slim Noodles : I discovered Wildwood pasta slim noodles at my local Andronicos. I purchased a spinach flavored fettuccine flavor (the one on the left) hoping it would taste more like spinach noodles and less like tofu. And it did! It is really good (if you like spinach)! As you would expect, the noodles are made from tofu and are totally vegan, high in fiber, and are gluten free. The *whole bag* (2 servings, or 200g) is 50 calories, 6 grams of fiber, 2 grams of protein, and 0 grams of fat, making it 0 weight watchers points.\nRicotta Pumpkin Treat : So, there are tons of ways to dress up ricotta cheese into a dessert on its own (I've heard of people adding sugar, cocoa, vanilla extract, etc. etc. to make pretty interesting desserts). I thought today in honor of the holidays I'd post a recipe for ricotta-pumpkin pudding. Pumpkin is another great low calorie food (a 1/2 cup serving is 50 calories, 0 grams of fat, 4 grams of fiber, and 1 gram of protein -- so 0 weight watchers points), and if you like it you will surely like this recipe (and if you don't like pumpkin, you should pass on this recipe and play around with just the ricotta cheese, since the pudding is thick and has a strong pumpkin flavor).\nWheatgrass Juice : I found out that wheatgrass is a type of plant, which looks a lot like the kind of grass you grow on your lawn (although it is actually a young gluten-free form of wheat). There are many, often extreme claims about the health benefits of wheatgrass of which various critics are skeptical. The supporters of wheatgrass claim that it has extremely high amino acid, vitamin, mineral and chrolophyll content. The supposed benefits are that it helps prevent diabetes, heart disease, hair loss and cancer while promoting a general feeling of well being by promoting better blood flow and detoxification.\nTropical Mango Bar : This bar is really tasty if you like the taste of the tropical fruits. It is totally raw, vegan, gluten-free, organic, and oil free. It only has fruit in it! But, unlike other fruit-only bars, it is hard, thick, and crunchy rather than fruity and chewy, making it quite filling (I actually find the taste to be pretty strong). The consistency reminds me a bit of a granola bar (I'm always on the lookout for great low calorie granola by the way!).\nSo Delicious Low Calorie Ice Cream : The mint minis are pretty yummy. Each one is only 90 calories, 2 grams of fat, 1 gram of fiber and 8 grams of sugar (2 weight watchers points). But, I think I've decided that I like the coconut ones more. The coconut sandwiches have 100 calories, 3.5 grams of fat (omega 3 from the coconut milk), 2 grams of fiber, and 1 gram of protein (so also 2 weight watchers points). They also differ from the mint versions because they are sweetened with agave syrup instead of regular sugar.\nFat Free Cheese : This cheese comes in many fat free flavors, namely: namely: Sharp Cheddar, Swiss, Mild Mexican, Garden Vegetable, Monterey Jack, Mozzarella and Jalapeno Jack. Picking one was a difficult decision, and I ultimately went with the Cheddar since it was the first one that caught my eye. Once I started adding it to my cooked foods and to my sandwiches I was extremely impressed. It really does melt, making it way better than most fat-free cheeses for cooking!\nCrispy Dried Pears : There are a few things I love about Crispy Green freeze dried fruit: (1) it comes in satisfying one serving bags that are around 38 calories each (0 weight watchers points) making it an extremely low calorie snack, (2) it comes in some really interesting/unique flavors including pear (my favorite), apricot, peach, pineapple, as well as apple, (3) the dried fruit is totally raw so it is very healthy (especially compared to those popular 100 calorie snacks) and (4) it is very crunchy and fun to eat!\nChocolate Covered Cocoa Nibs : Cocoa nibs aren't quite sweet enough to eat on their own (although they are great with other foods), so I was delighted to see that Kopali had decided to sell them covered in dark chocolate. Since both the cocoa nibs and the chocolate are full of healthy antioxidants and bioflavonoids as well as iron, these little treats are actually pretty good for you! One serving consists of 40 pieces (28 grams) of the little nibs, with 10 grams of fat and 2 grams of fiber (so 3 weight watchers points).While a small handful of these makes a great quick snack, I think a small portion of the chocolate covered cocoa nibs are most useful for \"chocolating\" up your favorite foods.\nSoy Joy Bars : Apple is my favorite flavor. It is 140 calories, with 6 grams of fat, 3 grams of fiber, and 4 grams of protein, making it 2 or 2.5 weight watchers points. It also has some iron and vitamin C in it, which is never a bad thing!\nYacon : What does dried yacon taste like? It is a bit difficult to describe but I'll do my best. It is a tuber like the potato, but it has a subtle bit of melon-like sweetness to it (but not too much, nothing close to the sweetness of a goldenberry). The petal-like pieces remind me a bit of a dried apple, but more rooty. :) The best way to really find out is to try it. Yacon is really low calorie. It comes in powder and syrup form, but I'm really into the dried yacon as a healthy snack.\nAvocado Smoothie : I recently got on an avocado kick, and I was feeling crazy one day so I decided to throw one into my blender to see what would happen. What resulted was a really thick creamy smoothie, almost like an ice cream shake. Since then, I've been playing around trying to make a perfect low calorie avocado smoothie. I haven't quite reached perfection yet, but I thought I'd blog about what I have, and then you could play around with your ideas as well.\nApple Blackberry Sauce : I recently found a new favorite organic apple sauce, made by a company called Santa Cruz Organic. I love their Apple Blackberry flavor. It is thick, sweet, and tasty! I like it enough that I'm trying to figure out ways to integrate it into other foods. For instance, this morning, I added a couple of teaspoonfuls to my cereal which created the most decadent cereal ever. This applesauce has great ingredients -- the entire list is \"organic apples, organic blackberry puree, organic apple juice concentrate, and vitamin C (from ascorbic acid).\"\nLow Calorie Mashed Potatoes : I thought I'd attempt to create some low calorie mashed potatoes, which are by far my favorite food during the holidays. I also decided to make low calorie mashed sweet potatoes (which are so filling with their subtle sweet taste) at the same time to see how they'd turn out. Each serving is 153 calories, 2.3 grams of fat, 3.6 grams of fiber, or 2-3 weight watchers points (right on the line). Pretty darn good for mashed potatoes!\nLow Calorie Indian Pakoras : I *adore* Indian food, but I have no idea how to make it myself, nor the time to do so. As such, I've come to really love many of the entrees made by Tandoor Chef (if you haven't already, check out my previous postings on their low calorie Indian Kofta Curry and their delicious l ow calorie Indian Naan ). These are an additional all natural (and vegan!) snack / appetizer that Tandoor Chef makes called spinach Pakoras.\nFizzit : I discovered these yummy little packets of women's vitamins called \"Fizzit\" (they also come in immunity, joint and multivitamin formulas as well). You just add the fizzit powder packet to a glass of water, and within a minute you have a flavorful, vitamin packed drink that is much more interesting than plain water. Each packet is only 25 calories (or 1 weight watchers point). Drinking these is much better than eating a 150 calorie snack, and a great way to find out if you are really thirsty instead of hungry.\nDark Hot Chocolate : Allegro Coffee just came out with a delicious dark hot drinking chocolate. I prefer dark chocolate to milk chocolate both because of its deep chocolatey taste as well as the health benefits like lowering blood pressure and protecting against heart disease. The flavor I bought is called Ghana 80, meaning that the Cocoa beans are from Ghana, and that it is very dark chocolate. Two tablespoons of the chocolate (1 serving) are 90 calories, 5 grams of fat, and 4 grams of fiber, making it *amazingly* only 1 weight watchers point.\nVan's Waffles : I really love Van's 97% fat free whole grain waffles. Two waffles are 140 calories, 2 grams of fat, 4 grams of protein, and 3 grams of fiber, meaning they are only 2 weight watchers points. They are a bit bigger than Van's Belgian Waffles (which I also love), which was a huge plus as well. They are also dairy and egg free which is a plus if you have dietary restrictions.\nNewman's Own Popcorn : Popcorn is such a good healthy snack since it is quite low in calories and high in fiber. However, most popcorn that you buy at the store contains really unhealthy ingredients like high fat hydrogenated oils or large amounts of sodium. If you don't have a popcorn popper, then a great alternative is Newsman's Own Organic \"Pop's Corn\" which is completely natural unsalted microwave popcorn.\nUnique Superfruits : While fruits that are typically eaten are all really good for us, it is also good for us to eat other less common fruits and vegetables to get additional health benefits that might not be found in our usual, sometimes repetitive eating routines (like figs, lychees, asian pears, and papayas). Broadening our fruit choices can improve our health!\nHoliday Teas : I love tea since it is a wonderful warm drink that I can turn to without any bad consequences for my diet (in fact a lot of teas are full of antioxidants which are actually great for one's health, so I can even feel good about drinking it!). Also, there are so many wonderful flavors of tea, I never get bored. Two of my favorite holiday teas are: (1) Celestial Seasonings Sugar Cookie Sleigh Ride and (2) Bigelow Eggnog'n.\nGlutino Chocolate and Banana Bars : I love the flavor combination of chocolate combined with banana, although I'm not usually able to find it in snack bars. So, when I found these gluten free chocolate and banana bars made by a company called Glutino at Whole Foods I was really excited. On top of being a delicious flavor, these bars have a lot of other things going for them, namely being totally organic, low calorie, and full of healthy (and desirable) ingredients like dark chocolate chips, quinoa, buckwheat, flaxseeds, and honey.\nLow Calorie Puppodums : I found some yummy looking puppodums at Whole Foods a few weeks ago that are made by a company called Tiger Tiger. I was thrilled to see that 2 packaged puppodums were only 47 calories, 0 grams of fat, and 3 grams of fiber (so 0 weight watchers points!). I decided to buy them to see how they would taste cooked without oil (sadly if you eat them at a restaurant you'll have to factor in additional calories for oil).\nQbel Chocolate Wafer Rolls : What are Qbel Chocolate Wafer Rolls exactly? Well, they are basically like pirouline rolls (round crispy/flaky wafers), except these are different in that they are coated inside with a thin layer of chocolate and then covered with an even more perfect layer of dark chocolate around the outside. The outer layer of chocolate is deliciously thick (*much* thicker than you'd imagine) -- in fact it is so thick, that it is hard to believe that two of these dark chocolate covered wafers are only 120 calories!!\nSnacktrition Fruit and Nut Mix : I'm a huge fan of trail mix and as much as I love making my own, sometimes I'm happy to buy pre-made mixes with ingredients I might not combine on my own. So when a cute container of trail mix at Whole Foods caught my eye the other day, I decided to give it a try. The trail mix I bought was made by a company called snacktrition and is called \"fruit and nut mix\". The mix consists of almonds, cashews, dried blueberries, dried cranberries, and some small yogurt chips.\nChocolate Covered Cocoa Nibs : The sweet riot chocolate covered cocoa nibs are really fabulous, and as much as I adore the other dark chocolate cocoa nibs I've blogged about, I have to say the one serving size container these come in also makes them really cool! What's also cool about the container is that you can re-use it by filling it with small one size servings of nuts, other treats, or even more coca nibs.\nWhole Grain Cracker Flats : When I found, Aunt Gussie's Cracker Flats I was thrilled since they exceeded my standards! These crackers are made primary with organic spelt flour which has a nutty flavor that I love! The whole ingredient list (for the garlic flavor that I buy) is: organic whole grain spelt flour, fresh onions, garlic, organic milled flax seeds, egg whites, non-gmo expeller pressed canola oil, and sea salt! The cracker box also boasts that the crackers have more than 8 grams of whole grain per serving, which is a huge plus!\nCrumpets : What I love about crumpets is that they are really large, thick, and bready. Just like with regular bread, you can toast them in the toaster, and dress them up to go with your favorite dishes. I find that they are great for dipping in sauce or soup, such as with the low calorie Dal Shorba Indian dish I blogged about previously this week. Or you can make mini-pizzas on them with pizza sauce and fat free cheese . Or, spread some olive oil across them for a delicious breakfast. The possibilities are really endless (in fact -- you can substitute crumpets in any of the low calorie lunch ideas that I posted for dressing up english muffins)!\nLaughing Cow Gourmet Cheese Bites : Inside the box are 25 individually wrapped cheese cubes (just like people serve at parties on toothpicks). But what makes these different from what you eat at parties is the fact that each one is only 7 calories and approximately a third of a gram of fat. That means that 5 of them (one serving size) is only 35 calories and 2 grams of fat) -- so one weight watchers point. Or, if you just want to eat one for a quick nibble/snack, eating two is zero weight watchers points.\nLow Calorie Cookies and Cream Shake : Several months ago, a friend sent me a note about the cookies and cream version of spiru-tein (protein powder). I did some research and it looked absolutely delicious, so I went out and bought some. I used it to create a smooth, creamy, delicious and healthy cookies and cream drink!\nWarm Cinnamon Apples : A while ago I wrote about the many health benefits of apples . Basically, apples are a great source of fiber in the form of pectin, as well as a great source of antioxidants. A friend of mine suggested that I try cooking apples in the microwave, which sounded intriguing. What resulted from cooking the apple with cinnamon was a dessert/snack that tastes just like apple pie.\nLuna White Chocolate Macadamia Bar : I'm a huge fan of Luna Tea Cakes , and I like many of the flavors of Luna's regular bars as well. So, when I saw this White Chocolate Macadamia Luna bar at Whole Foods a week or so ago, I absolutely had to try it! I've been a big fan of Luna brand bars for a long time because I like what they stand for -- nutrition for women (although men can totally eat them too!) as well as natural ingredients, combined with great taste.\nFruit Mashups : I recently found these nifty pouches of organic fruit puree made by a company called Revolution Foods at my local Whole Foods. Each pouch contains a squeezable serving (called a \"mashup\") of blended fruit, that has the consistency, in my opinion, of apple sauce. What's fun about these pouches is that you can put them in the freezer, and easily create all-natural pure fruit popsicles!\nLow Calorie Ice Cream Cups : A friend recently pointed me towards the 100 calorie Eating Right Light Ice Cream Cups, which actually pass my ingredient test! The flavor I decided to try is called pomegranate (which you can see in the picture). For those of you that don't like pomegranates, the cups also come in Mocha Cappuccino and Vanilla flavors as well (which I haven't tried yet -- let me know if they are good).\nLow Calorie Egg Rolls : As much as I love healthy, hearty food, I do like to splurge every one in a while. So, when I find products like 70 calorie egg rolls that meet my ingredient requirements (you can read about them in my About Me section), I get pretty excited! I love finding and/or making lower calorie versions of foods that I'd normally have to avoid when eating out at restaurants. The egg rolls I'm referring to are made by a company named Kahiki, and they are really fantastic!\nKashi Mighty Bites : I love Kashi products -- their brand stands for hearty whole grain goodness, which is exactly what their products always deliver. I've been eating Kashi whole grain puffs for a long time. In fact, a whole cup of the whole grain puffs (70 calories) makes such a really filling breakfast when combined with a cup of almond milk and some frozen blueberries .\nHere are some additional Low Calorie food ideas you might want to check out:\n"}, {"score": 1161.491, "uuid": "30ed2c86-c115-5152-b2e7-9648553b4d5c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1814wb-84-16273", "target_hostname": "www.yummydietfood.com", "target_uri": "http://www.yummydietfood.com/2008/06/yummy-healthier-low-calorie-snack-list.html", "page_rank": 1.7032193e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Yummy, Low Calorie Diet <em>Food</em> -- Plus Where <em>to</em> Buy!", "snippet": "When I am craving really bad <em>food</em> (but I don&#x27;t want <em>to</em> eat fat and oil), I sometimes pair these <em>to</em>-die-for wings with french <em>fries</em> (which I <em>bake</em>, you can read about <em>it</em> here).", "explanation": null, "document": "Yummy, Healthier, Low Calorie Snack List\nGrilled Cheese Puffs : On top of being healthy, these organic cheese puffs are a perfect blend of cheese flavor and crunch, making them a really fun and satisfying treat/snack to eat. One portion is only 120 calories, 5 grams of fat, and 1 gram of fiber, and 3 weight watchers points (I know, I wish it was 2, but just not enough fiber). And, they are gluten free!\nLow Calorie Trail Mix : I came across a vegan product called Cocoa Nibs by a company called TerrAmazon at one of my local health food stores (called Country Sun). This trail mix is made primarily with small cocoa nibs, and the flavor I bought has added raisins and coconut that round out the crunch and taste. The cocoa nib mix is definitely a low calorie, healthy, well rounded snack (and trail mix substitute) at only 112 calories per serving, 3 grams of fat, 3 grams of natural fiber, 3 grams of protein, and 2 weight watchers (WW) points.\nHummus and Pita : I eat hummus and pita for lunch all the time on the weekend. My favorite thing to do is to toast the pita so that it gets crunchy. Then I open it up and spread the hummus inside of the pocket. It keeps lunch from being messy, and it warms the hummus which I think is so wonderful! Sometimes I sneak some low fat cheese in there too, to make it more like a sandwich.\nLow Calorie Crepes : I recently found these wonderful crepes in the frozen food section at Whole Foods. Unfortunately, they are a bit expensive, but they are a totally delicious, low calorie food (also low in weight watchers points at only 2 WW points per giant crepe). If you heat them up a bit, you can unfold them and spread them across an entire plate. Then you can put on them whatever you please. I personally like putting my favorite low calorie ice cream on them (half a serving usually).\nBuffalo \"Chicken\" : So, I know you loyal meat eaters out there will be skeptical of this food recommendation, but I highly encourage you to get past the vegan label, and give these chicken-free buffalo wings a try! When I am craving really bad food (but I don't want to eat fat and oil), I sometimes pair these to-die-for wings with french fries (which I bake, you can read about it here). Three of these wings comes in at 2 points, so you can eat two servings of them for 4 points, along with the side of your choice!\nLow Calorie Ice Cream : So, in the spirit of weight watchers, I am always on the lookout for low calorie frozen yogurts and ice creams. I like to stay away from artificial sweeteners and other ingredients I can't understand, so I was quite pleased when I found this Whole Soy and Co brand soy frozen yogurt. I know it is called \"soy frozen yogurt\" but to me, that just means ice cream! I find this stuff to be as yummy as any ice cream I've ever eaten, so to me eating soy frozen yogurt suffices for my ice cream cravings.\nLow Calorie Pistachio Nuts : These yummy little pistachios make for an awesome afternoon snack. They are healthy, filling, fun to eat, and tasty! They come in four different flavors: \"Roasted and Salted,\" \"European Roast,\" \"Salt and Pepper\" (my personal favorite), and \"Roasted No Salt.\" None of the flavors have any added oils or artificial ingredients. A one serving bag at Jamba Juice is 3 weight watchers points.\nLow Calorie Egg Nog : I love drinking egg nog around the holidays. However, not being a huge milk fan, I've bought Soy Nog in the past (which I affectionately refer to as \"Sog\"). Soy Nog is delicious, but it is pretty high in calories, at 90 calories per half cup serving (their label is a bit misleading by having such a small serving size). So, this year, I decided to try to make my own low calorie egg nog (with no artificial sweeteners of course)! And, I am pleased to report that it actually turned out pretty good!\nAlmondina Biscotti-Like Cookies : I recently found these delicious little all natural cookies at Whole Foods called Almondina. My flavor of choice is called \"The Original,\" which is made with almonds and raisins, and has no dairy, added fat, salt or cholesterol. The cookies also come in other flavors like pistachios with almonds, as well as chocolate with almonds. Each cookie is very very thinly sliced and super crunchy. They actually remind me of a cross between an almond muffin, a biscotti (but thinner, with less calories), and a crunchy \"bready\" crouton (one of the many foods I love but usually try to avoid).\nLuna Tea Cakes : A little while ago Luna came out with a lower calorie, yummy, mint chocolate flavored \"tea\" bar I really love called a Luna Tea Cake. This bar is really different than most bars in that it is a bit more like a soft tea flavored cookie with subtle but tasty flavoring, than a dense protein filled bar. I like that the bars contain tea in them, as tea is full of healthy antioxidants. The Mint Chocolate (my personal favorite) and Orange Blossom flavors of the Luna Tea Cake are 130 calories, and only 2 weight watchers points. The other two flavors, berry pomegranate (140 calories) and vanilla macadamia (150 calories) are 3 WW points.\nGone Nuts -Low Calorie Chocolate and Nuts : A company by the name of Living Intentions creates this delicious, gently dried raw mix of cocoa, sprouted almonds and raisins called \"Gone Nuts\" that is really to die for. The vegan and gluten free mix is crunchy and chocolately and even a bit gooey - but in a good way (you can still eat it with your hands without making a mess)! The best part is that the mix is only 103 calories per 28 gram serving, with 4 grams of fat, 2 grams of fiber, and 2 grams of protein (so 2 weight watchers points).\nLow Calorie \"Cheez-It\" Crackers : But alas, the people at Ian's must have realized that there are people like me in the world, because they created little 100 calorie pouches of *organic* and *all natural* cheddar crackers that look and taste just like cheez-its. Technically they are marketed to kids, but I think they are also marketed to those (like me) who have a kid inside of us that wants to eat crackers like these. Plus a picture of cartoon animal on the front of a box never stopped me from eating something. :) A pouch of these crackers is 100 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, 2 grams of fiber, and 2 grams of protein (so 2 weight watchers points).\nLow Calorie Mini Won Tons : I absolutely love Indian Food , sometimes a little too much. So, I'm always on the lookout for low calorie Indian options at the store. When I saw some low calorie organic Vegetarian Indian Curry flavored won tons (aka mini-pot stickers) at Whole Foods, I just had to try them! Making them was really quick and easy and they came out crispy and delicious. In fact, the flavor and consistency really reminded me of samosas that you can get at Indian restaurants. Even better, these little vegan won-tons are low calorie! Six of them (55 grams) is 80 calories, 1.5 grams of fat, 3 grams of protein, and 1 gram of fiber (or 2 weight watchers points).\nGoRaw Live Super Cookies : I'm a big fan of raw food, even though I'm not a vegan or a raw foodie. There are two reasons why I like it: (1) it is healthy since it is not processed at all and is made from foods that occur in nature, and (2) it really fills me up, way more than non-raw foods. I'm not exaggerating about the full thing, I think raw food makes me about twice as full as non-raw food. If I were more disciplined I'd eat it all of the time. A bit ago I discovered some pretty tasty chocolate flavored raw super cookies made by a company called goraw. The full ingredient list is: organic coconut (unsulphered), sprouted organic sesame seeds, organic date, raw organic agave nectar, and raw organic cocoa.\nLow Calorie Apple Pie Toaster Pops : Amy delivers great taste and a wonderful breakfast through her organic, vegan, Toaster Pops that taste so good (the outside is like pie crust, the inside is like apple pie filling) it is difficult to believe that each one only has 150 calories! Each Toaster Pop is 3 WW points (a bit of a bigger weekday breakfast for me, without going crazy), and is well balanced with whole wheat ingredients, real organic apples, and only 3.5 g of fat, 6g of sugar, and 4g of protein.\nTrader Joes Chocolate Wedges : A few years ago, I discovered these amazing chocolate wedges called \"The Chocolate Traveler\" at my local Trader Joes (with amazing nutritional info). These one-serving sized chocolate wedges are a gift to those of us who love chocolate, but strive to eat it in moderation. Each wedge is a bit over 30 calories (1 WW point), and is big enough to satisfy your chocolate or sweet craving. I have a deal with myself where I only eat one a day.\nFage Yogurt : Do you love thick, creamy, yogurt? If the answer is yes, you have to try Fage! It is one of the thickest, most creamiest, healthy desserts / low calorie snacks that exists (that I have found). Fage yogurt comes in different varieties. My favorite (for dieting) is the 0%, which provides a whopping 5.3 ounces of creamy delight for merely 80 calories (2 WW points if you eat the entire serving). Fage also comes in a 2% variety (make sure you purchase the one with the calories you desire), which you can buy packaged with small sides of fruit, or a point more.\nLesser Evil Flavored Popcorn : For most people dieting or trying to eat healthy, popcorn is a great snack, but usually not flavored popcorn. In fact, as a kid, I used to love eating candied popcorn, but as an adult trying to eat healthy and watch my weight, I didn't think I would ever be able to eat anything like it again. That was, until I spotted \"Lesser Evil\" (meaning it does not have \"evil\" ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, artificial stuff, or hydrogenated oils) popcorn in the chips and popcorn aisle at Whole Foods. Lesser Evil was right on target for me, with only 120 calories & 2 WW points for all 4 flavors (although the peanut butter flavor serving is slightly smaller in volume -- see shopping tip below), per 30 gram serving. Yay!\nCocoa Berries : Inside the box are very decently sized dark chocolate candies (made from Guittard chocolate) with fresh, ripe, freeze dried blueberries inside of them. You can also buy them filled with fresh freeze dried strawberries instead of blueberries, which I imagine are also really tasty! The Cocoa Berries are not overly crunchy on the inside -- they have a very light crunch and a perfect amount of fruit flavor which makes them interesting (and not chewy), without overpowering the chocolate taste or consistency.\nFunky Monkey Freeze Dried Fruit : We all know that we are supposed to integrate several servings of fruits and vegetables into our diets every day. I personally love fruit (and I guess I also like some vegetables), but unfortunately I have found that it is not always easy to carry fruit with me when I am on the go. Dried fruit is definitely more portable, so I'm always on the lookout for interesting dried fruit options at the store. Funky Monkey distinguishes itself from many dried fruit options in two important ways: (1) the fruit has no added sugar so it is low calorie, and (2) the fruit is combined with other natural flavors (like cinnamon, lime juice, acai) that make it extremely yummy!\nLow Calorie Gluten Free Donuts : You are probably wondering how big the donuts are. I'd say they are a pretty good size (not too big, not too small -- 45g to be exact). What is interesting about them is how dense they are. One donut is way more filling than 2 of the vans waffles I usually eat. Also, when I eat a donut, I automatically feel like I ate something bad (even if it wasn't), so I find that I tend to be less tempted by other things after I eat one. So, if you are looking for a lower calorie donut or have been looking for a gluten or wheat free donut substitute, these are definitely worth a try. They definitely aren't healthy compared to many other food options, but I think they are a fun and yummy indulgence for every once in a while.\nPizza Munchees : If you cook these pizza munchees in your oven (I've yet to try the microwave), what results is a crispy shell that is reminiscent in taste to the outside of mozzarella stick appetizers that you get at Italian restaurants. Amazingly, *six* of these pizza munchees (which are a bit larger than they look on the package) come in at 180 calories, with 5 grams of fat, and 2 grams of fiber (4 weight watchers points) making them a great low calorie lunch option . If you are looking to decrease the calories and eat them as a snack, you can eat five munchees for 150 calories (3 WW points), four for 120 calories (2 WW points), or two munchees for 60 calories (1 WW point).\nWasabi Peas : Wasabi Peas are commonly found in bars and at parties, but what you might not know about them is that they actually make a pretty smart, low calorie snack. What I personally love about them is how incredibly spicy and wasabi-y they are (I love Japanese food!). They also have tons of crunch which, as you know, is something I look for. Another great thing about wasabi peas is that they are very difficult to overeat because of their extremely strong wasabi flavor. Not only can you only eat one or two at a time, but they are also *not* the kind of snack where you will accidentally eat the whole bag (the spiciness would make most people sick).\nYotta Bar : Yottabar is a \"granola\" snack bar that contains 1 serving of both my fruits and my vegetables, which makes me feel happy about eating it. It also doesn't contain anything \"bad\" like High Fructose Corn Syrup, something I try to avoid. My favorite flavor is cherry, followed quickly by orange. They have other flavors as well.\nKashi Low Calorie Cereal : I love many of the Kashi products, including many of the different Kashi cereals. But, this cereal is very special, because it is only 70 calories per 1 cup serving. Yes, one entire cup! Almost hard to believe! I love this stuff. When I pair this cereal with half a cup of almond milk (20 calories), I end up with a very low calorie meal (90 calories/2 points) that keeps me pretty full and gets me all the way to lunch most of the time.\nBaked French Fries : First, start by buying frozen french fries in the freezer section of any supermarket (Safeway makes my favorite kind). Then, instead of putting them in the deep fryer, you bake them in the oven on very high heat. I personally like my french fries really crispy, so I bake them for a long time, sometimes even broiling them at the end to make them crispy. And, even better, you can usually eat a good portion of fries (like 20) for 120 calories, or 2 WW points. Not too shabby!\n40 Calorie Almond Milk : This stuff is amazing!! It is only 40 calories a cup (1 point for WW diet). Sometimes I put it in cereal, or smoothies, and sometimes I just drink it plain with some nutmeg, like eggnog. I highly, highly recommend this to anyone who is dieting. They also have a \"sweet\" version, around 60 calories or so. I like to stick with this one, though, since it is so low calorie.\nBaked Chips : Baked chips are a big staple for me. They don't taste low calorie and certainly don't seem like diet food. They come in all sorts of varieties and flavors, and eating them doesn't seem like a compromise. I highly recommend Baked Lays, although there are a lot of potato chips out there that are 130 or less calories per serving, with fiber and protein. A great place to look at chips is at Whole Foods.\nBanana Puffet : My favorite is the banana puffet (featured to your left), which is more \"desserty\", but the company makes other types as well that could substitute as a side for one of your meals (like the \"Eat Your Greens Puffet\" or \"Carrot Risotto Puffet\"). The Banana Puffet is only 2 points, with 2 points of fiber.\nClif Z Bars : The Clif \"Kid\" Z Bar is one of my most favorite snack bars. It is very healthy -- it is organic, whole grain, has fiber, and has no artificial ingredients. It is also quite yummy, and filling. It is a great snack. They come in an array of flavors (in order from my favorite to least favorite): Chocolate Chip, Honey Graham, Peanut Butter, Brownie, Blueberry, and Apple Cinnamon. They are super cheap (maybe because they target kids instead of dieters), and they are available for $.49/each at my local Whole Foods.\nFiberful Bars : I was thrilled when I came across these super-delicious fiber-enriched fruit bars at Trader Joe's, which, with 60 calories and 6 grams of fiber, cost 0 WW points to eat! These fruit leathers are quite big in size (20g), and they come in a wide variety of tasty flavors such as apricot, mixed berry (my personal favorite), boysenberry, and strawberry. Sometimes I'll eat one of these fruity treats before I go out to a restaurant to curb my hunger, which makes me less tempted to order something really bad for my diet when dining out.\nSteel Cut Oatmeal : Trader Joe's Steelcut Oatmeal is a great alternative to preparing steel cut oats on your own, for those of you that are busy or don't like to cook (if you do, you should totally try making your own steel cut oatmeal straight from the oats). Inside the box are two pre-sized portions of brown sugar and maple syrup flavored oatmeal that you just place into a bowl and microwave to prepare. The portion size is very large and filling, and due to all the fiber, it is only 2 WW points (150 calories)!\nIan's Low Calorie Cookie Butons : I recently came across Ian's Cookie Buttons at my local Whole Foods. They are similar to 100 calorie packs, in that they come in little one-serving packages that are actually made for kids. These cookies buttons are a much better alternative to many of the other 100 calorie cookie packs on the market since they are made from non-bleached flour (wheat flour in the case of the Chocolate Chip and Double Chocolate Chip Flavors), and do NOT contain any refined sugars.\nLow Calorie Samosas : The trick to keeping these samosas low calorie is to *not* follow the directions on the box which suggest that you deep fry them. Instead, heat up a pan with a teaspoon of oil (if you do this, make sure you count the points), or a tablespoon or two of water, or just a non-stick cooking spray like Pam, and pan fry them rather than deep frying them. Alternatively, you could put them in the oven and bake them.\nLow Calorie Turkey Pepperoni : Since pepperoni derives its flavor from the spices and not the mystery meat it's made of, the turkey version tastes exactly the same as any other pepperoni. As you can see from the picture, however, it has 70% less fat than regular pepperoni. That adds up to 50% fewer calories per serving.\nBanana Smoothie : So today I thought I'd share with you my first recipe. It only has a few ingredients, but that doesn't mean it isn't super yummy. Use the recipe to make a low calorie, healthy, banana smoothie that doesn't require any mixes, anything unnatural, or anything artificial.\nDried Fruit : In general, dried fruits are a great choice when it comes to snacking. They are tasty (very sweet if you like sweet things) and they still contain fiber and nutrients. They are much better than reaching for something starchy like a bagel, or some of the other items you might find in an average vending machine. Sensible foods makes wonderful pouches of dried fruit that make a great filling & healthy snack, without costing you tons of calories.\nChocolate Goji : So, having never tried Goji Berries, I was quite intrigued when I found this package of \"Chocolate Goji Treats\" made by Superfood Snacks when I was shopping at Whole Foods. Inside the bag are \"nuggets\" that not only contain cocoa powder and Goji Berries, but also contain other raw and natural ingredients like raisins, coconut (which I absolutely love!!!), and sesame seeds. Each Goji treat looks a like coconut covered date (both in shape and in size).\nBarbara's Low Calorie Cereal : There are two reasons why I love cereal. The first reason is that I think it makes for a super yummy, healthy, and filling breakfast (or even lunch sometimes) when combined with low calorie almond milk and some frozen fruit or frozen bananas (for only 3-4 WW points depending on which cereal variety you pick). Secondly, I love it because it makes a great (and crunchy!) 2 WW point snack -- and there are so many different healthy varieties of cereal on the market that it never gets old!\nYummy, Fresh, Low Calorie Salsa : I love salsa! Not only is it low calorie and good for you, it is also great with baked chips (super yum!), on quesadillas, soft tacos, eggs, etc. There are really countless ways to incorporate salsa into your meals and snacks. In a personal quest to find the perfect salsa, I tried making my own salsa several times, but unfortunately, I never created a salsa that I really loved. Then, I discovered a really yummy homemade-like salsa at a friend's bbq that turned out to be Casa Sanchez' Salsa Roja.\nJulie's Ice Cream Sandwiches : Julie's ice cream sandwiches are different, and different in many good ways! Not only are they very low in calorie (100 calories/sandwich or 2 WW points), they are also made with real, ice cream! Yes, I did say real ice cream -- made with all natural ingredients, so for those of you that don't like soy ice cream or low calorie frozen yogurt , you will find that they are tasty, creamy, rich and yummy beyond belief.\nHint Flavored Water : If you are too busy to make your own naturally flavored water, I have to say Hint water is a very close substitute. The fruit flavor is very subtle, but yummy enough to help me easily drink my 8 cups of water per day. I really like drinking Hint water when it is refrigerated versus warm. Hint water comes in a ton of flavors (you can check out the Hint website to see a complete list) of which my personal favorites are pear and strawberry kiwi.\nGnu Bars : In particular I really like the chocolate brownie flavor, and I absolutely love the banana walnut flavor (reminds me of banana bread - another food I don't get to eat as often as I would like). As with most of the foods I blog about, these bars are not only super tasty but they contain good ingredients -- full of fiber, whole wheat flower, no artificial flavors, no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup, which always puts a smile on my face.\nPotato Rondelet : A friend of mine recently turned me onto Potato Gratin Rondelets, a french version of potatoes and low calorie cheese , made by Whole Kitchen. A big fan of both potatoes and cheese, I have to say, she didn't have to do a lot of work to convince me to try them, especially once she told me that they are only 100 calories each (or 2 WW points). These potato rondelets (I personally like to call them potato domes) are delicious. Each one is somewhat petite, but is definitely big enough as a side dish, or would make a great snack, if you were having a potato craving.\nFigamajigs : he Figamajig bars come in a few flavors: dark chocolate covered fig (2 WW points, 130 calories), dark chocolate covered mint (2 WW points, 130 calories), dark chocolate covered raspberry (2 WW points, 130 calories), and dark chocolate covered almond bar (3 WW points, 150 calories). My personal favorite is the plain one. These figs and chocolate give the bars such a strong taste that the extra flavoring isn't really needed to make them yummy (although the flavored ones are really good, and the crunch in the almond one is nice!).\nSushi : Sushi can definitely be difficult to navigate when you are on a diet or watching your calorie intake, since there are so many different kinds of ingredients that can be in a roll. But, it shouldn't be all-out avoided, since many rolls are made with healthy ingredients that are actually good for you (like avocado, seaweed, cucumber, fish). It is all about your choices. With that in mind, I put together some sushi eating tips, staring with a special tip just for those of you out there that don't eat fish.\nBaked Krisps : I've tried some of the other \"better for me\" chips and crackers that are out there in the past, which I've liked for the most part, but these krisps are different both in taste and consistency. First of all, they are very thin and crunchy not thick and rice-y like many low calorie rice crackers/chips that are on the market today (you can kind of see the difference from the picture). Second of all, the flavoring is really yummy, and done well enough to fill that Sour Cream and Onion craving that I just can't avoid sometimes.\nLow Calorie Whole Wheat Tortilla : I've been eating La Tortilla Factory high fiber tortillas for a long time. They are a great bread substitution, and also work well for making quesadillas (with fat free cheese, salsa , fat-free sour cream -- super yum!), burritos, soft tacos, egg sandwiches, low calorie pizza , and more.\nLow Calorie Potato Pancakes : I don't have words to describe how much I enjoy eating these Golden brand Potato Pancakes. They are unbelievable amazing and are only 1-2 WW points (70 calories each, right on the edge between 1 and 2 points). After you heat them up (I've heated them both in the microwave and in a pan with PAM), you can put some fat free sour cream on them for only a small amount of added calories.\nFrozen Fruit : There are tons of different frozen fruits available at the supermarket (and you can also make your own at home). My personal favorite is frozen cherries because they come without pits and ready to eat (they also taste *amazingly* good). In addition to cherries, I am also a big fan of frozen mango, frozen blueberries, as well as frozen bananas .\nSoy Nuts : So, soy nuts can definitely be yummy, although they aren't quite as fulfilling as eating peanuts (they are much lighter in weight which is why a serving is so much bigger, and they aren't as flavorful, so I would not eat them alone). But, I've found they work really well as a substitute for some purposes!\nSpicy Boca Chicken : I think Boca Spicy Chicken (\"Chick'n\") Patties are delicious, and their high level of protein (11g per serving) is just an added bonus to something that I already enjoy eating. As you might be imagining, these patties are a great low-fat substitute to fried chicken. The fun thing about them is that there are so many things you can do with them, as they make such a great low calorie lunch option !\nLow Fat Cheese : Dieting and eating low calorie doesn't mean you have to give up cheese! Cheese and other dairy products are great sources of calcium as well as protein so it is great if you can find a way to incorporate low fat dairy into your diet. As you probably know there are many low fat and non-fat milk substitutes that you can purchase at your local supermarket. What you might know know is that: (1) some low fat dairy products taste better than others, (2) some low fat dairy products contain undesirable ingredients so it is important to read nutrition labels carefully, and (3) cooking with low fat dairy can be tricky.\nSweet Herbal Tea : Drinking tea is a great idea, but not when you feel like you need to add tons of sugar to make it tasty. That is why I personally love Good Earth's Sweet and Spicy Herbal Tea (note, it comes in a non-herbal version as well, so make sure you buy the right one). This tea is the yummiest, sweetest tasting unsweetened tea I've ever had. It's made from a flavorful Rooibos base, has no caffeine (unless you buy the caffeine version), contains natural antioxidants, and has a strong, sweet, cinnamon taste.\nVitamin Drink : A few months ago I came across Zenergize Vitamin Boost tablets at my local Whole Foods. They were a bit expensive, but I decided to try them anyway since I figured they might taste good, and they might help me drink more water (and even get more vitamins) during the day. I have to say, they beat my expectations! At only 2 calories per tablet (0 weight watchers points goes without saying), with 0 g sugar, and all natural ingredients, they have a lot going for them! On top of that, what is really nice about these tablets is how potent they are.\nAttune Probiotic Bars : Attune chocolate bars taste a lot like regular candy bars, in fact they are a close substitute to a Nestle's crunch bar. Unfortunately for us, each bar is more petite than a Nestle's crunch, but the Attune bars are still an impressive, filling size, especially considering how yummy they are. The Attune chocolate bars come in 4 delicious all-natural, gluten-free flavors: Chocolate Crisp, Dark Chocolate (my personal favorite, which is also vegan by the way), Mint Chocolate, and Blueberry Vanilla (made with delicious White Chocolate).\nTortilla Chips : One of my favorite kinds of these chips is made by Whole Foods (365 is the brand). The chips are all natural, large and ready to be dipped in yummy salsa, like at a restaurant, and best of all, they taste authentic (I think it is because they are made with stone ground whole white corn -- at least that is what the bag says). The kind I buy are only \"Lightly Salted\" (50mg of sodium per serving) which is actually kind of hard to believe because they taste so good, even when I don't dip them in salsa or put anything on them.\nJulie's Sorbet Bars : Julie's Sorbet bars are organic, non-fat, cholesterol free, made from real fruit, and one bar is only 60 calories (coming out to 1 weight watchers point). They taste like you're eating fruity ice cream, which is impressive considering that are completely non-dairy. Julie's Organic Sorbet Bars make the perfect yummy low-calorie dessert, especially at the end of the day after dinner when you're craving something sweet or fruity, but can't afford to eat many more calories.\nPacific Low Calorie Almond Milk : The 35 calorie milk I bought from Pacific isn't as strongly vanilla flavored as the almond breeze I am used to drinking, and therefore not quite as tasty. But I see online that Pacific has a vanilla unsweetened flavor as well (at 40 calories), so I'm going to start looking for that at all my local supermarkets. For now, I have a lot of the non-vanilla kind, so I'm adding a bit of vanilla extract and nutmeg (and sometimes cinnamon) to sweeten it up and make it more flavorful.\nEdamame : I love eating edamame (it is high in protein, as well as vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium and iron), although I usually avoid ordering it as an appetizer at a Japanese restaurant because it is so expensive. The price is really pretty ridiculous considering how easy it is to buy and make edamame on your own at home! Also, when you make edamame at home, you can control the salt content, which is a huge added benefit to anyone watching their salt intake. So, you might be wondering, how do you make edamame at home?\nFiber Muffins : Although they look like muffins to me, Zen Bakery calls these fabulous, high fiber blueberry muffins by the name of \"fiber cakes\". Perhaps it is because each one contains a whopping 13g of natural fiber which makes them incredibly filling despite their somewhat petite size (they really aren't that small, but compared to the muffins you'd buy at a bakery, they are somewhat small).\nIzze Esque : spotted something called Izze Esque, sitting close to the regular Izze sparkling juice I always craved but never bought. Izze Esque was all good news -- a 60 calorie (40 calories per 8 ounce) serving of the same kind of sparkling juice, made by the same company that cares so much about keeping its products all natural. After buying some, I found that I like Izze Esque just as much as I liked the full calorie Izze flavor. I'm not really sure how the Izze people pulled off the delicious taste without adding anything artificial, but they did!\nO'Coco Chocolate Crips : I have to admit, I'm really impressed with these crackers. I never realized it until I ate them, but they actually satisfy two of my cravings: (1) chocolate and (2) crunch, and with only 90 calories (2 weight watchers points) in a pre-portioned bag, I have to say, they are right up my alley and they make a great low cal snack food. The crisps are not only delicious, light, and crunchy but they are also all-natural, organic, and hydrogenated oil free.\nCoconut Milk Yogurt : So recently I was perusing the yogurt section of Whole Foods, hoping to mix up my yogurt selection a bit, and an all natural Coconut milk yogurt caught my eye (made by Turtle Mountain). I was intrigued since I absolutely love the taste of coconut, but it is yet another food that that I have found difficult to integrate into my low calorie diet. I was also interested in this yogurt since I go through phases where I avoid dairy, and as much as I enjoy soy products, I always think it is interesting to explore non-soy alternatives to dairy as well.\nFrozen Bananas : When people think about freezing fruit, they often think about frozen blueberries, frozen cherries, frozen strawberries, etc. (all super yummy and great for your health/diet), but today I wanted to write about another type of frozen fruit -- frozen bananas! Bananas are my favorite fruit and freezing them makes them even better (and sweeter). In this post, I've answered a few questions you might have.\nHuuraw Vegetable Chips : I recently discovered some completely raw chips in the \"extremely natural foods\" aisle at Whole Foods. They looked interesting so I turned them over and was overjoyed by the calorie information -- 1 oz (28g) of chips for 40 calories, 2.5g of fat, and 2g of fiber! So, basically, one serving of these chips is only 1 weight watchers point (and extremely low in calories) vs. tortilla chips which are usually 2-3 WW points for the same size serving. It is amazing what happens when you don't add oil to a food to prepare it!\nEnglish Muffins : I've always loved English muffins as a kid, but I've steered clear of them through many years of dieting and watching my weight, because I always assumed they were high calorie like other white colored breads that I knew I needed to avoid. But, I recently rediscovered them (ironically they were in my refrigerator because someone I live with eats them a lot), when I happened to see the nutritional information on the back of the box. Now, maybe you all already knew this, but English Muffins are totally within reason calorie-wise and if you choose carefully, you can even eat ones that are actually pretty good for your health and your diet.\nFruitabu : The smooshed bars have no added sugar, are each half a serving of fruit, and come in several yummy flavors including apple, apricot, grape, raspberry, and strawberry. What is great about these bars vs. the fiberful bars is that they have less calories (the smooshed bars are 40 calories vs. the 60 calories in the fiberful bars). However, because the fiberful bars have added fiber, they come out to be 0 weight watchers points, whereas these bars are 1 WW point.\nKrinkle Sticks : I was thrilled to find that the krinkle sticks are very low in calorie like their popcorn counterparts, coming in at only 110 calories per 1 cup serving (aka 2 weight watchers points), which is awesome! As for the taste -- they turned out pretty good. They remind me of a cross between a very crunchy well-seasoned french fry, and a baked chip, both foods that I really like. The krinkle sticks also come in a classic sea salt flavor (which I imagine is more french fry like) and a bar-b-q flavor as well. If you've tried them, I'd love to hear what you thought of them!\nDagoba Dark Chocolate Tasting Squares : I happened to see a small Dagoba chocolate bar over by the checkout counter called a Dagoba tasting square (note: it was not with the Dagoba bars in the chocolate aisle). The one I bought (and have continued to buy) is called \"Pacuare\" and has 68% cocoa content, combined with sugar, cocoa butter, and soy lecithin (and is gluten-free). Although the Dagoba Tasting Square does not have calorie information, the bar is labeled as being 9g (~50% bigger than the Trader Joes chocolate wedge). And, the tasting chocolate bar is totally delicious, just as I would have expected based on the other Dagoba chocolates I had eaten.\nDreyers Frozen Fruit Bars : Enamored with the coconut bar, I've since tried some of the other flavors, including strawberry and orange cream -- all worth exploring. Like with the coconut bar, I found these bars to be quite satisfying because of the effect of their thickness and real fruit content on their flavor and texture. Dreyers also makes other flavors, namely grape, lemonade, lime, tangerine and strawberry-banana smoothie.\nAmy's Steel Cut Oatmeal : As I mentioned previously, steel-cut oatmeal is delicious and filling, but very time consuming to make. Like with the Trader Joe's version, Amy has created a pre-made frozen version of the oatmeal which you can conveniently make on your own. The serving size is really filling (255g) and the oatmeal is quite tasty. In terms of nutrtition, the oatmeal is dairy free, all natural, and has 220 calories, 3.5 grams of fat, and 5 grams of fiber (so 4 weight watchers points).\nGo Raw Banana Bread Bar : If the banana bar looks big in the picture, it is because it is quite large and flat (1.2 oz), and amazingly filling at only 120 calories (and 2 weight watchers points). The only ingredients in the bar are sprouted organic flax seeds, organic banana, organic unsulphured coconut, and organic dates, which contribute to its 5 grams of fiber, 4 grams of protein and 5 grams of fat. The label boasts that this bar is wheat free, gluten free, cholesterol free, has no added sugar, was made by hand, uses no GMOs and is 100% organic, so clearly it has a lot going for it.\nPopovers : After I left home to go to college, I went many years without coming across a popover, until I discovered a fantastic, healthy, easy-to-make (with only four ingredients which is ideal for me since I'm not a skilled cook) recipe for making popovers in a friend's Betty Crocker Cookbook. This popover recipe (which is now available online) not only helps me make delicious popovers, but each one only has 100 calories and 1 gram of fat (2 weight watchers points total).\nLow Calorie Granola : I later found a granola (on the lowest shelf just as I was about to give up) by a company called Enjoy Life, a brand known for their gluten free foods. Although I had never tried their products before, I decided to buy the Cinnamon Crunch flavor which had 160 calories (with 5 grams of fiber, and 3 grams of protein) for a half a cup serving -- 3 weight watchers points for a whole serving, but only 1 WW point for half a serving. This was one of the lowest calorie and lowest fat granolas I found, so I decided to try it and take it home for a taste test.\nApples : So, why are apples so good for us? Well, there are many reasons! What I learned in the article is that apples are a great source of fiber in the form of pectin, as well as a great source of antioxidants. The fiber helps cleanse our bowels and encourages good colon heath. Apples are also believed to help lower your bad cholesterol, reduce the risk of cancer, slow down our aging (my favorite benefit!) by lessening the effects of stress, diabetes, and heart disease, and help prevent hair loss.\nNada Moo Ice Cream : I recently found another delicious lower calorie ice cream substitute at Whole Foods called Nada Moo. This ice cream is unique from other low calorie ice creams and low calorie frozen yogurts I've found, as it is made from coconut milk and brown rice milk, so it is not soy based and it is dairy free (note: the label has a disclaimer that says it contains soy within its ingredients, but because the ice cream is not soy based, it does not have that soy taste that some people abhor). One of my favorite parts of this ice cream is its subtle coconut taste, even in the non-coconut flavors.\nLow Calorie \"Rice Krispies\" Cereal : The crispy rice cereal made by Erewhon is made entirely from brown rice (not even processed into flour), barley malt, and sea salt and is organic, 100% whole grain, wheat free, and fat free -- with only 1 gram of sugar. It is also only 110 calories per giant 30 gram serving (the serving is huge since each of the puffed rice crisps is full of air!). This cereal is exactly like rice krispies which I loved as a child, just a little less sweet, which is a-ok with me.\nGoldenberries : Have you ever heard of a goldenberry? Well, goldenberries are apparently a \"superfruit\" that hail from South America. From what I've read they appear to be very healthy - with a high vitamin A content. They are rich in bioflavonoids, which help reduce inflammation in the body. They also contain a high level of vitamin A, vitamin C, beta-carotene, vitamin P, as well as some iron. In case you are wondering, vitamin P (sometimes known as rutin) is believed to strengthen the circulatory system in addition to helping with vitamin C absorption.\nLow Calorie Banana Bread : A wonderful, delicious, wholesome low calorie banana bread recipe created by a fellow blogger! Each piece is only 60 calories, 1 gram of fat, and 1 gram of fiber (so 1 weight watchers point). There are tons of great ways to eat this bread as well!\nMint Water : If you like mint (and I mean if you *really* *really* like the taste of mint), and you are looking for a way to drink flavored water (without added sweeteners or calories), then you might want to try Metromint waters. I discovered Metromint waters one day when I was really thirsty while shopping at Whole Foods. When I saw that the water had 0 calories, was all natural, and was available in a *chocolate mint* flavor, I just had to try it. I had never tasted chocolate flavored water before!\nKind Bars : Luckily, there is one flavor of the Kind bar that I've discovered called \"Walnut and Date\" that is less calories than the others -- with only 150 calories, 7 grams of fat, 3 grams of fiber and 2 grams of protein per bar - so 3 weight watchers points. It is also *very* delicious (just not my favorite since the other one has coconut). The \"Walnut and Date\" bar also has a lot going for it -- it is all natural, dairy free, gluten free, and wheat free. I'm a nut lover, and I think this bar is the perfect blend of walnuts (one of the best nuts you can eat), dates and honey. It is both sweet and nutty at the same time!\nFigamajigs Bite Sized Candies : A company called Figamajigs not only makes yummy chocolate fig bars (which I blogged about previously), but they also make a pretty low calorie fig candy that is a great, all-natural, healthier substitute for candies like M&Ms. These figamajigs candies come in a few flavors, some candy coated, some not, including: dark chocolate, dark chocolate with candy coating, mint flavor, and mint flavor with candy coating. My favorite by far is the mint flavored candy coated (which is pictured)!\nGreen Superfood : The low down on all-organic green superfood is that one serving has the antioxidant equivalent to seven servings of fruits and vegetables. Inside of each serving is a blend of four powders: (1) Green Foods (things like grass, alfalfa, spinach), (2) Antioxidants (acai, carrot, beet, green tea), (3) Fiber (flax seed powder, apple pectin fiber), and (4) Digestive Enzymes & Probiotics (acidophilus , chicory root). These blends contribute to a packet of green powder that has 100% of your daily vitamin A (great for your skin), 40% of your daily vitamin C, 50% of your vitamin K, as well as large amounts of other vitamins as well.\nWildwood Past Slim Noodles : I discovered Wildwood pasta slim noodles at my local Andronicos. I purchased a spinach flavored fettuccine flavor (the one on the left) hoping it would taste more like spinach noodles and less like tofu. And it did! It is really good (if you like spinach)! As you would expect, the noodles are made from tofu and are totally vegan, high in fiber, and are gluten free. The *whole bag* (2 servings, or 200g) is 50 calories, 6 grams of fiber, 2 grams of protein, and 0 grams of fat, making it 0 weight watchers points.\nRicotta Pumpkin Treat : So, there are tons of ways to dress up ricotta cheese into a dessert on its own (I've heard of people adding sugar, cocoa, vanilla extract, etc. etc. to make pretty interesting desserts). I thought today in honor of the holidays I'd post a recipe for ricotta-pumpkin pudding. Pumpkin is another great low calorie food (a 1/2 cup serving is 50 calories, 0 grams of fat, 4 grams of fiber, and 1 gram of protein -- so 0 weight watchers points), and if you like it you will surely like this recipe (and if you don't like pumpkin, you should pass on this recipe and play around with just the ricotta cheese, since the pudding is thick and has a strong pumpkin flavor).\nWheatgrass Juice : I found out that wheatgrass is a type of plant, which looks a lot like the kind of grass you grow on your lawn (although it is actually a young gluten-free form of wheat). There are many, often extreme claims about the health benefits of wheatgrass of which various critics are skeptical. The supporters of wheatgrass claim that it has extremely high amino acid, vitamin, mineral and chrolophyll content. The supposed benefits are that it helps prevent diabetes, heart disease, hair loss and cancer while promoting a general feeling of well being by promoting better blood flow and detoxification.\nTropical Mango Bar : This bar is really tasty if you like the taste of the tropical fruits. It is totally raw, vegan, gluten-free, organic, and oil free. It only has fruit in it! But, unlike other fruit-only bars, it is hard, thick, and crunchy rather than fruity and chewy, making it quite filling (I actually find the taste to be pretty strong). The consistency reminds me a bit of a granola bar (I'm always on the lookout for great low calorie granola by the way!).\nSo Delicious Low Calorie Ice Cream : The mint minis are pretty yummy. Each one is only 90 calories, 2 grams of fat, 1 gram of fiber and 8 grams of sugar (2 weight watchers points). But, I think I've decided that I like the coconut ones more. The coconut sandwiches have 100 calories, 3.5 grams of fat (omega 3 from the coconut milk), 2 grams of fiber, and 1 gram of protein (so also 2 weight watchers points). They also differ from the mint versions because they are sweetened with agave syrup instead of regular sugar.\nFat Free Cheese : This cheese comes in many fat free flavors, namely: namely: Sharp Cheddar, Swiss, Mild Mexican, Garden Vegetable, Monterey Jack, Mozzarella and Jalapeno Jack. Picking one was a difficult decision, and I ultimately went with the Cheddar since it was the first one that caught my eye. Once I started adding it to my cooked foods and to my sandwiches I was extremely impressed. It really does melt, making it way better than most fat-free cheeses for cooking!\nCrispy Dried Pears : There are a few things I love about Crispy Green freeze dried fruit: (1) it comes in satisfying one serving bags that are around 38 calories each (0 weight watchers points) making it an extremely low calorie snack, (2) it comes in some really interesting/unique flavors including pear (my favorite), apricot, peach, pineapple, as well as apple, (3) the dried fruit is totally raw so it is very healthy (especially compared to those popular 100 calorie snacks) and (4) it is very crunchy and fun to eat!\nChocolate Covered Cocoa Nibs : Cocoa nibs aren't quite sweet enough to eat on their own (although they are great with other foods), so I was delighted to see that Kopali had decided to sell them covered in dark chocolate. Since both the cocoa nibs and the chocolate are full of healthy antioxidants and bioflavonoids as well as iron, these little treats are actually pretty good for you! One serving consists of 40 pieces (28 grams) of the little nibs, with 10 grams of fat and 2 grams of fiber (so 3 weight watchers points).While a small handful of these makes a great quick snack, I think a small portion of the chocolate covered cocoa nibs are most useful for \"chocolating\" up your favorite foods.\nSoy Joy Bars : Apple is my favorite flavor. It is 140 calories, with 6 grams of fat, 3 grams of fiber, and 4 grams of protein, making it 2 or 2.5 weight watchers points. It also has some iron and vitamin C in it, which is never a bad thing!\nYacon : What does dried yacon taste like? It is a bit difficult to describe but I'll do my best. It is a tuber like the potato, but it has a subtle bit of melon-like sweetness to it (but not too much, nothing close to the sweetness of a goldenberry). The petal-like pieces remind me a bit of a dried apple, but more rooty. :) The best way to really find out is to try it. Yacon is really low calorie. It comes in powder and syrup form, but I'm really into the dried yacon as a healthy snack.\nAvocado Smoothie : I recently got on an avocado kick, and I was feeling crazy one day so I decided to throw one into my blender to see what would happen. What resulted was a really thick creamy smoothie, almost like an ice cream shake. Since then, I've been playing around trying to make a perfect low calorie avocado smoothie. I haven't quite reached perfection yet, but I thought I'd blog about what I have, and then you could play around with your ideas as well.\nApple Blackberry Sauce : I recently found a new favorite organic apple sauce, made by a company called Santa Cruz Organic. I love their Apple Blackberry flavor. It is thick, sweet, and tasty! I like it enough that I'm trying to figure out ways to integrate it into other foods. For instance, this morning, I added a couple of teaspoonfuls to my cereal which created the most decadent cereal ever. This applesauce has great ingredients -- the entire list is \"organic apples, organic blackberry puree, organic apple juice concentrate, and vitamin C (from ascorbic acid).\"\nLow Calorie Mashed Potatoes : I thought I'd attempt to create some low calorie mashed potatoes, which are by far my favorite food during the holidays. I also decided to make low calorie mashed sweet potatoes (which are so filling with their subtle sweet taste) at the same time to see how they'd turn out. Each serving is 153 calories, 2.3 grams of fat, 3.6 grams of fiber, or 2-3 weight watchers points (right on the line). Pretty darn good for mashed potatoes!\nLow Calorie Indian Pakoras : I *adore* Indian food, but I have no idea how to make it myself, nor the time to do so. As such, I've come to really love many of the entrees made by Tandoor Chef (if you haven't already, check out my previous postings on their low calorie Indian Kofta Curry and their delicious l ow calorie Indian Naan ). These are an additional all natural (and vegan!) snack / appetizer that Tandoor Chef makes called spinach Pakoras.\nFizzit : I discovered these yummy little packets of women's vitamins called \"Fizzit\" (they also come in immunity, joint and multivitamin formulas as well). You just add the fizzit powder packet to a glass of water, and within a minute you have a flavorful, vitamin packed drink that is much more interesting than plain water. Each packet is only 25 calories (or 1 weight watchers point). Drinking these is much better than eating a 150 calorie snack, and a great way to find out if you are really thirsty instead of hungry.\nDark Hot Chocolate : Allegro Coffee just came out with a delicious dark hot drinking chocolate. I prefer dark chocolate to milk chocolate both because of its deep chocolatey taste as well as the health benefits like lowering blood pressure and protecting against heart disease. The flavor I bought is called Ghana 80, meaning that the Cocoa beans are from Ghana, and that it is very dark chocolate. Two tablespoons of the chocolate (1 serving) are 90 calories, 5 grams of fat, and 4 grams of fiber, making it *amazingly* only 1 weight watchers point.\nVan's Waffles : I really love Van's 97% fat free whole grain waffles. Two waffles are 140 calories, 2 grams of fat, 4 grams of protein, and 3 grams of fiber, meaning they are only 2 weight watchers points. They are a bit bigger than Van's Belgian Waffles (which I also love), which was a huge plus as well. They are also dairy and egg free which is a plus if you have dietary restrictions.\nNewman's Own Popcorn : Popcorn is such a good healthy snack since it is quite low in calories and high in fiber. However, most popcorn that you buy at the store contains really unhealthy ingredients like high fat hydrogenated oils or large amounts of sodium. If you don't have a popcorn popper, then a great alternative is Newsman's Own Organic \"Pop's Corn\" which is completely natural unsalted microwave popcorn.\nUnique Superfruits : While fruits that are typically eaten are all really good for us, it is also good for us to eat other less common fruits and vegetables to get additional health benefits that might not be found in our usual, sometimes repetitive eating routines (like figs, lychees, asian pears, and papayas). Broadening our fruit choices can improve our health!\nHoliday Teas : I love tea since it is a wonderful warm drink that I can turn to without any bad consequences for my diet (in fact a lot of teas are full of antioxidants which are actually great for one's health, so I can even feel good about drinking it!). Also, there are so many wonderful flavors of tea, I never get bored. Two of my favorite holiday teas are: (1) Celestial Seasonings Sugar Cookie Sleigh Ride and (2) Bigelow Eggnog'n.\nGlutino Chocolate and Banana Bars : I love the flavor combination of chocolate combined with banana, although I'm not usually able to find it in snack bars. So, when I found these gluten free chocolate and banana bars made by a company called Glutino at Whole Foods I was really excited. On top of being a delicious flavor, these bars have a lot of other things going for them, namely being totally organic, low calorie, and full of healthy (and desirable) ingredients like dark chocolate chips, quinoa, buckwheat, flaxseeds, and honey.\nLow Calorie Puppodums : I found some yummy looking puppodums at Whole Foods a few weeks ago that are made by a company called Tiger Tiger. I was thrilled to see that 2 packaged puppodums were only 47 calories, 0 grams of fat, and 3 grams of fiber (so 0 weight watchers points!). I decided to buy them to see how they would taste cooked without oil (sadly if you eat them at a restaurant you'll have to factor in additional calories for oil).\nQbel Chocolate Wafer Rolls : What are Qbel Chocolate Wafer Rolls exactly? Well, they are basically like pirouline rolls (round crispy/flaky wafers), except these are different in that they are coated inside with a thin layer of chocolate and then covered with an even more perfect layer of dark chocolate around the outside. The outer layer of chocolate is deliciously thick (*much* thicker than you'd imagine) -- in fact it is so thick, that it is hard to believe that two of these dark chocolate covered wafers are only 120 calories!!\nSnacktrition Fruit and Nut Mix : I'm a huge fan of trail mix and as much as I love making my own, sometimes I'm happy to buy pre-made mixes with ingredients I might not combine on my own. So when a cute container of trail mix at Whole Foods caught my eye the other day, I decided to give it a try. The trail mix I bought was made by a company called snacktrition and is called \"fruit and nut mix\". The mix consists of almonds, cashews, dried blueberries, dried cranberries, and some small yogurt chips.\nChocolate Covered Cocoa Nibs : The sweet riot chocolate covered cocoa nibs are really fabulous, and as much as I adore the other dark chocolate cocoa nibs I've blogged about, I have to say the one serving size container these come in also makes them really cool! What's also cool about the container is that you can re-use it by filling it with small one size servings of nuts, other treats, or even more coca nibs.\nWhole Grain Cracker Flats : When I found, Aunt Gussie's Cracker Flats I was thrilled since they exceeded my standards! These crackers are made primary with organic spelt flour which has a nutty flavor that I love! The whole ingredient list (for the garlic flavor that I buy) is: organic whole grain spelt flour, fresh onions, garlic, organic milled flax seeds, egg whites, non-gmo expeller pressed canola oil, and sea salt! The cracker box also boasts that the crackers have more than 8 grams of whole grain per serving, which is a huge plus!\nCrumpets : What I love about crumpets is that they are really large, thick, and bready. Just like with regular bread, you can toast them in the toaster, and dress them up to go with your favorite dishes. I find that they are great for dipping in sauce or soup, such as with the low calorie Dal Shorba Indian dish I blogged about previously this week. Or you can make mini-pizzas on them with pizza sauce and fat free cheese . Or, spread some olive oil across them for a delicious breakfast. The possibilities are really endless (in fact -- you can substitute crumpets in any of the low calorie lunch ideas that I posted for dressing up english muffins)!\nLaughing Cow Gourmet Cheese Bites : Inside the box are 25 individually wrapped cheese cubes (just like people serve at parties on toothpicks). But what makes these different from what you eat at parties is the fact that each one is only 7 calories and approximately a third of a gram of fat. That means that 5 of them (one serving size) is only 35 calories and 2 grams of fat) -- so one weight watchers point. Or, if you just want to eat one for a quick nibble/snack, eating two is zero weight watchers points.\nLow Calorie Cookies and Cream Shake : Several months ago, a friend sent me a note about the cookies and cream version of spiru-tein (protein powder). I did some research and it looked absolutely delicious, so I went out and bought some. I used it to create a smooth, creamy, delicious and healthy cookies and cream drink!\nWarm Cinnamon Apples : A while ago I wrote about the many health benefits of apples . Basically, apples are a great source of fiber in the form of pectin, as well as a great source of antioxidants. A friend of mine suggested that I try cooking apples in the microwave, which sounded intriguing. What resulted from cooking the apple with cinnamon was a dessert/snack that tastes just like apple pie.\nLuna White Chocolate Macadamia Bar : I'm a huge fan of Luna Tea Cakes , and I like many of the flavors of Luna's regular bars as well. So, when I saw this White Chocolate Macadamia Luna bar at Whole Foods a week or so ago, I absolutely had to try it! I've been a big fan of Luna brand bars for a long time because I like what they stand for -- nutrition for women (although men can totally eat them too!) as well as natural ingredients, combined with great taste.\nFruit Mashups : I recently found these nifty pouches of organic fruit puree made by a company called Revolution Foods at my local Whole Foods. Each pouch contains a squeezable serving (called a \"mashup\") of blended fruit, that has the consistency, in my opinion, of apple sauce. What's fun about these pouches is that you can put them in the freezer, and easily create all-natural pure fruit popsicles!\nLow Calorie Ice Cream Cups : A friend recently pointed me towards the 100 calorie Eating Right Light Ice Cream Cups, which actually pass my ingredient test! The flavor I decided to try is called pomegranate (which you can see in the picture). For those of you that don't like pomegranates, the cups also come in Mocha Cappuccino and Vanilla flavors as well (which I haven't tried yet -- let me know if they are good).\nLow Calorie Egg Rolls : As much as I love healthy, hearty food, I do like to splurge every one in a while. So, when I find products like 70 calorie egg rolls that meet my ingredient requirements (you can read about them in my About Me section), I get pretty excited! I love finding and/or making lower calorie versions of foods that I'd normally have to avoid when eating out at restaurants. The egg rolls I'm referring to are made by a company named Kahiki, and they are really fantastic!\nKashi Mighty Bites : I love Kashi products -- their brand stands for hearty whole grain goodness, which is exactly what their products always deliver. I've been eating Kashi whole grain puffs for a long time. In fact, a whole cup of the whole grain puffs (70 calories) makes such a really filling breakfast when combined with a cup of almond milk and some frozen blueberries .\nHere are some additional Low Calorie food ideas you might want to check out:\n"}, {"score": 1137.4622, "uuid": "720fabce-ceaa-553d-aae5-d04f90f3eba6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1813wb-62-22673", "target_hostname": "www.leicestershirediabetes.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.leicestershirediabetes.org.uk/539.html", "page_rank": 1.4026245e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": ":: Leicestershire Diabetes :: <em>Healthier</em> Asian Recipes", "snippet": "Oven <em>bake</em> or shallow <em>fry</em>, try this unusual but sweet blend of spicy vegetable kebabs Download Document Vegetable Biryani- Classic in English and Gujarati Try this traditional healthy classic rice dish.

As you said, <em>it</em> can be very expensive <em>to</em> eat healthy. I have never heard of fermenting <em>food</em> but I am anxious <em>to</em> look into <em>it</em>. Your website <em>is</em> really great.", "explanation": null, "document": "By KerryAnn Foster\nWe\u2019ve fallen in love with this recipe and this is the only way I will make fries in the future. My kids inhale these and ask for more, no matter how many I make. They are just like I remember fast food fries to be- crisp on the outside, hot and soft on the inside. And since they\u2019re fried in tallow, I feel good about my kids eating them.\nWhen I developed this recipe, I\u2019d been in a fermenting funk. I was having a hard time coming up with something creative. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love my sauerkraut and kefirs. But I needed something\u2026. more. Different. Something my kids would love. One of my dear friends, Loztnausten, had a post about making shoestring french fries and one on fermenting fries . I had read it long ago, but I kept on having the \u2018too much work\u2019 mantra scroll in my head. Hand-cutting all of those fries\u2026. I wanted a food processor with a blade that could do it for me, but it was out of my budget. If I wanted french fries, I would ask my husband to make them for me as a treat, when I was working a late night and he had some free time and was looking to dote on me by whipping up something special and junky in the kitchen for us to munch on while I slaved away on the computer. Last January my husband made some french fries, using the mandolin slicer I had recently acquired from a friend. He asked me to look up what temp to cook them at, as his last batch had turned out too oil-logged. We knew he needed a higher temperature, so I surfed over to Everything Free Eating to see how LZ does her fries and I again saw the fermented fries post.\nA light bulb went off.\nThe Research\nI did a little research. In this paper , fermentation with a lactic acid bacteria (LAB) resulted in a reduction of the acrylamide in french fries by as much as 90% after 15 minutes. Fermenting in an anaerobic environment is the best way to encourage the production of LAB at home so your can achieve this same result without needing a lab coat, a college degree and an industrial process to cook your diner.\nWhy do we want to reduce the acrylamide ? It\u2019s a carcinogen . Anything that browns while it cooks- bread, potatoes, chips, biscuits, pretty much any baked or fried good, forms acrylamide as it browns.\nHow does LAB fermentation work to reduce the acrylamide? A quote from Science Daily tells us\n\u201cAcrylamide is formed as a reaction between the amino acid asparagine and simple sugars such as glucose and fructose. Put simply, the lactic acid bacteria remove these compounds and inhibit the formation of acrylamide.\u201d\nIf you\u2019d like to read more about how LABs consume these simple sugars, this book is a good place to start studying. The paper mentioned above, Lactic acid fermentation reduces acrylamide formed during production of fried potato products , was published in the journal Aspects of Applied Biology. It says in its summary:\n\u201cLactic acid bacteria (LAB) metabolise simple sugars rapidly, producing lactic acid which lowers pH and reduces the Maillard reactions initiated by heat. This method can be used in industries producing fried potato products to reduce their problems with acrylamide formation. Applying the LAB method to French fries shortly prior to the pre-frying step reduces acrylamide formation as much as 90%. Browning reactions consequently are reduced. Sensory analysis shows loss of colour and burnt smell and taste without affecting quality of final potato sticks. A fermentation time of approximately 15 minutes is needed given a dense LAB culture. The results from large scale industrial- batch as well as continuous experiments \u2013 indicate that LAB fermentation provides the best means for acrylamide mitigation in the production of fried potato products.\u201d\nThe Application\nSo the research says that LAB thrives best in an anaerobic environment. Anaerobic means that oxygen is not present; aerobic means that oxygen is present. In order to get LABs to proliferate, I needed to provide an anaerobic environment that would encourage their growth while discouraging the growth of all non-beneficial species, especially the aerobic ones.\nSo, how can be get an anaerobic environment in home fermentation? That can only be accomplished with a seal that prevents oxygen from entering while an airlock allows carbon dioxide to escape. Without an anaerobic environment, the LABs will not flourish and the acrylamides will not greatly diminish. Open air fermentation will not reduce acrylamides to the same extent due to the lack of LABs. As the bacteria produce carbon dioxide and use up the oxygen, it reduces the population of undesirable, aerobic bacteria and allows the LAB to flourish in the oxygenless environment. The Pickl-It provides this type of environment, as it as an airtight seal and an airlock for the growing carbon dioxide to escape. An open bowl provides a continuous supply of oxygen, never increasing the amount of LAB present and giving an environment that is ideal for the undesirable, aerobic bacteria to flourish. A mason jar would not, either, as it has to be burped regularly to allow the building carbon dioxide to escape. Any time you burp a mason jar, it allows oxygen to rush into the vessel, starting the process all over again. Not burping the jar would cause explosions, as I have had happen in the past. An air-tight vessel with an air lock is the only way to see the LABs flourish and therefore reduce the acrylamide in the potatoes.\nThis makes sense to me. The examples of ancient fermentation crocks I have seen contained wooden lids and were buried while they ferment. A good example is Korean Kimchi. Ditto for the Icelanders and their fermented shark, called Hakarl , which sits in the ground for 6-12 weeks to ferment. You don\u2019t get air circulation under the ground.\nYou will notice in the study, that the concentration of LABs used to reduce the acrylamide by 90% was a 1% solution. In order to reach a concentration of 1% in your own kitchen, you need your potatoes to be in an environment where oxygen can not enter for 3-6 days, according to the Handbook of Fermented Functional Foods . If you preview this book on Amazon using their Look Inside! feature, you can read about it on page 402 of this wonderful and very detailed book. Other parts of this book are available on Google Books, if you\u2019d like to read the beginning of the book.\nThe Recipe\nMmmmm\u2026 crispy outside, soft inside, and just the right amount of salt!\nI had my kids wash some potatoes and using the mandolin slicer, I sliced about 10 potatoes into fries in less than 10 minutes. Do not peel the potatoes before you cut them, as LABs are mainly present on the skin of the produce. I placed my mandolin over a big bowl to catch the fries. When I was done slicing, I covered the fries with cold water and set them aside to soak for about 30 minutes while I washed dishes. This helps draw starch out of the potato. I drained and rinsed them, then placed them into my Pickl-It fermentation vessel.\nOnce in the Pickl-It, I filled it with a mix of 1-1/2 tsp of salt to each quart of water. I have since learned that the owner of Pickl-It, Kathleen Mills, recommends you use 8 grams of salt to every pound of vegetables, and I will be trying this amount in the future. I placed the dunker on top to make sure the potatoes stay under the water level, closed the vessel and put the air lock in place according to the directions. I sat it in the out of the way place I keep my ferments. All told, it took me about 15 minutes of hands-on time.\nThen I walked away for three days.\nOne of these days, I will learn to not take pictures while running my grain mill. Pardon my dust\u2026 and the unmilled bits of rice on the counter!\nWhen I was ready to do my fries, I pulled the air lock off of the vessel, dumped it all into a colander in my sink and then rinsed the fries thoroughly.\nI spread them out on a kitchen towel and patted them until dry on all sides. If the fries are not dry when they go into the oil, they will not become crispy.\nI took a quart of tallow and placed it into a 2-quart or larger pot. Because oil expands greatly when you fry, you want to fill the pot no more than half full with oil. Make sure you use a heavy-bottomed pot that heats evenly and enough oil that the fries can move freely. I used my Staub enameled cast iron dutch oven. I put it onto the burner on high and using a thermometer, I watched the fat until it came to 400 degrees.\nWhy tallow? It has a smoke point of about 420 degrees. Coconut oil smokes at 350 and lard at 370 degrees. They will both begin to break down and smoke before hitting the right temp, so tallow it is.\nThen I lowered the fries into the hot oil, about one serving at a time. You can drop them in, away from you, by hand, or place them onto a spider or wire skimmer and lower them into the oil. Fry, stirring occasionally, until they reach your happy spot. My happy spot is about 6 minutes when put into 400 degree oil.\nDon\u2019t overload the pot or the fries will become soggy from the temperature of the oil dropping too much from the addition of the room temperature fries. You don\u2019t want to see the oil drop below about 350 degrees when you put in the fries. You want crisp, not soggy.\nSee how much the oil expanded? It really bubbles once you put a batch of fries in. Be sure to not overload your pot! Notice the temp is 355 degrees after I put the batch of fries in. If you add too many fries,the oil will drop to too low temp and make for oil-logged fries.\nAllow the oil to return to 400 degrees before you put in your next batch of spuds. That\u2019s it! Easy-peasy, quick, and your kids will be thrilled with the results! Now, I no longer hear \u201cthat\u2019s the place we used to get French Fries\u201d when I drive by a certain fast food place anymore. Now I hear \u201cwhen are you gonna cook the fries fermenting on the counter, mama?\u201d\nAnd I couldn\u2019t be happier.\nFries, fresh out of the oil, sprinkled with some Redmond\u2019s Real Salt\nDisclaimer: I receive no commission from any of the links above.

My kids inhale these and ask for more, no matter how many I make. They are just like I remember fast food fries to be- crisp on the outside, hot and soft on the inside. And since they\u2019re fried in tallow, I feel good about my kids eating them.\nWhen I developed this recipe, I\u2019d been in a fermenting funk. I was having a hard time coming up with something creative. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love my sauerkraut and kefirs. But I needed something\u2026. more. Different. Something my kids would love. One of my dear friends, Loztnausten, had a post about making shoestring french fries and one on fermenting fries . I had read it long ago, but I kept on having the \u2018too much work\u2019 mantra scroll in my head. Hand-cutting all of those fries\u2026. I wanted a food processor with a blade that could do it for me, but it was out of my budget. If I wanted french fries, I would ask my husband to make them for me as a treat, when I was working a late night and he had some free time and was looking to dote on me by whipping up something special and junky in the kitchen for us to munch on while I slaved away on the computer. Last January my husband made some french fries, using the mandolin slicer I had recently acquired from a friend. He asked me to look up what temp to cook them at, as his last batch had turned out too oil-logged. We knew he needed a higher temperature, so I surfed over to Everything Free Eating to see how LZ does her fries and I again saw the fermented fries post.\nA light bulb went off.\nThe Research\nI did a little research. In this paper , fermentation with a lactic acid bacteria (LAB) resulted in a reduction of the acrylamide in french fries by as much as 90% after 15 minutes. Fermenting in an anaerobic environment is the best way to encourage the production of LAB at home so your can achieve this same result without needing a lab coat, a college degree and an industrial process to cook your diner.\nWhy do we want to reduce the acrylamide ?

Since mid-2009, consumers have been spending more and more of their paychecks -- now almost 4.5% -- on dining out. While spending on grocery items takes a bigger slice of those paychecks, it has remained basically flat over the same period.\nThe choice of whether to eat in or dine out may seem obvious, but for people still trying to recover from the Great Recession , it's often not that simple. A closer look at the financial and time pressures families are experiencing helps explain why.\nShopping and preparing meals takes time -- something people simply don't have these days. And if Americans do find a spare hour here or there, they're likely to dedicate it to work so they can earn a little extra income, writes Neil Dutta, an economist at Bank of America and co-author of the report.\nFind restaurant recipes to make at home\nOn top of that, supermarket food prices are increasing at a staggering 6% a year, about 2.5 times as fast as the cost of restaurant meals, according to the report. It is becoming cheaper for consumers to dine out. \"It's all about substitution, as prices at grocery stores rise, consumers will respond by making choices,\" says Dutta.\nOne of the biggest drivers behind the increased food costs is the rising price of commodities like wheat and corn. Grocery stores tend to pass on these price hikes directly to consumers. Restaurants too, have to deal with increasing commodity prices, but they are better able to offset them by buying in bulk and cutting back in other areas -- like wages. With youth unemployment hovering aroiund 24%, it's an unfortunate truth that restaurants are able to find younger workers who will do more for less.\nTo get a read on the relative value of dining out versus eating in, The Fiscal Times took a (virtual) trip to some large restaurant chains and compared the prices of meals there to the costs of preparing the same meals at home. Admittedly, our methodology was highly unscientific. After all, we're based in New York City. Further, we didn't go hunting for the best grocery deals and didn't factor in whether one meal or another would be healthier or friendlier to the environment. But that's part of the point -- eating right and finding the extra savings that could be had by comparison shopping come with money and time commitments many families can't afford.\nThe comparisons that follow at least offer some food for thought.\nOutback Steakhouse\nMeal: 10oz rib-eye dinner (includes soup, salad and asparagus)\nTotal price: $17.99\nGrocery store: rib-eye, $9.55; soup, $2.99; bag salad, $3.99; asparagus, $3.99 a bunch\nTotal: $20.52\nWinner: Outback\nGrocery store items were calculated using prices at FreshDirect .

Unless the butcher has already done so, tie the meat around with string at even intervals to hold it together. Heat 2 tsp of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Lay the beef in the pan and fry over a high heat for 5 mins to seal, turning often (step 1). Transfer it to a roasting tin, season with pepper and a pinch of salt, then roast for 17-18 mins (this roasts to medium-rare).\nMeanwhile, put the porcini in a small heatproof bowl, cover with boiling water and leave for 20-30 mins to soak. Pour 1 tbsp of the remaining oil into the same frying pan (don't wash it) that the meat was cooked in. Tip in the shallots, garlic and chestnut mushrooms and fry for 4-5 mins, stirring often, over a high-ish heat, so all the liquid is first released from the mushrooms then evaporated, and all are softened. Remove from the heat, stir in the parsley and tarragon (step 2), season with pepper and a pinch of salt, and leave to cool.\nPut the mix of leaves in a large heatproof bowl, pour over boiling water, leave for 30 secs, then tip into a colander, rinse under the cold tap and drain. Squeeze out all the moisture with your hands and pat dry with kitchen paper. Chop and set aside. Drain the porcini, reserving 5 tbsp of the soaking liquid. Chop the porcini finely and stir into the mushroom mix. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment.\nWhen the beef is done, remove from the oven and let it sit in the tin for 10 mins for any juices to be released. Lower the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Lift the beef from the tin (keep all the juices in the tin for the gravy) and lay it on kitchen paper. Leave until dry and cool enough to wrap in the filo.\nLay 1 of the filo sheets on the work surface with the short end facing you. Brush all over with a little of the remaining oil (you will have 1 tbsp and 1 tsp left). Layer up and oil 4 more filo sheets in the same way. Remove the string from the cooled beef. Spread the chopped leaves down the middle of the pastry, so it is the same length and width as the fillet. Top with the mushroom mix and lightly press down (step 3). Lay the beef over this, with the top of the beef facing down. Bring the long sides of the filo over the beef to enclose it (step 4), then turn it over so the join is underneath. Tuck both ends of the pastry under (trim first if necessary to reduce any excess) and place on the lined baking sheet so all the joins are on the bottom. Brush with more oil.\nLay the last sheet of filo on the work surface in front of you, with one of the longest sides towards you, then cut across its width into 5 strips. Lay these one by one, slightly overlapping, over the wrapped beef, scrunching up an edge of each strip slightly as you go to give a bit of height (step 5). Carefully brush with the last of the oil, then bake for 30 mins until golden. If the pastry starts to brown too quickly, loosely lay a piece of foil over the top. Remove the meat and let sit for 5-10 mins before slicing.\nMeanwhile, make the gravy. Heat the saved roasting juices in the roasting tin, stirring to deglaze. Stir in the flour. Gradually pour in the wine, stirring all the time to blend in the flour. Stir in the stock and reserved porcini liquid and bubble for about 8-10 mins to reduce a little. It should have body, but be thinner like a 'jus'. Stir in the mustard and season with pepper. Transfer the beef to a platter, then slice thickly with a sharp knife and serve with a spoonful or two of the gravy.\nHOW IT'S HEALTHIER\nLower the fat content of your Wellington by using filo pastry instead of puff, eliminating butter, a non-stick frying pan to reduce the amount of oil needed, replacing the pate and using herbs and garlic to boost flavour without needing salt.\nPER SERVING\n350 kcalories, protein 39.5g, carbohydrate 8.3g, fat 16.6 g, saturated fat 5.0g, fibre 1.3g, sugar 0.8g, salt 0.8 g\nRecipe from Good Food magazine, April 2012 .\nSave and share this recipe\nWant to share this recipe with your family and friends?

I like extra cheesy fries. Don't you??\n1/2 cup of seasoned Italian breadcrumbs\nVegetable cooking spray. This is IMPORTANT. I sprayed one baking tray and not the another.

And also, we do want those dulcet tones to stay dulcet. Celery sticks with peanut butter will only appease them for so long.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a little bit of junk food, or \u2018treats\u2019 as you may term it. But if you want to do the right thing by your kids \u2013 and your own body \u2013 then your local confectionery aisle or donut store is not the place to go for answers. Do you remember Michael Pollan\u2019s Food Rules ? Here\u2019s one of my favourite ones:\nEat all the junk food you want as long as you cook it yourself.\nThree reasons:\n1. It takes effort to make junk food. You\u2019re less likely to be eating cupcakes every day if you have to bake them yourself. And as Michael says, would you be eating french fries if you had to peel, slice, parboil, cook once, drain, cook again\u2026?\n2. Your junk food is better than store junk food. Poor quality ingredients, way more sugar than you would dream of putting in, trans fats, and preservatives. Do you really know what\u2019s in that packet of chocolate chip cookies? Make it yourself and you know what you\u2019re eating.\n3. Cooking is fantastic family time. Not to mention useful life skills \u2013 tell your son that chicks totally dig a guy who can make them heart-shaped cookies. This summer, arrange some cooking activities with your family. I guarantee they\u2019d much rather eat and share the lopsided muffins they made themselves than the ones you bought at the shops when they weren\u2019t around to help you choose.\nAnd a final note, packet-mix cakes and cookie rolls don\u2019t count! (Do you call them cookie rolls? You know what I mean anyway). They\u2019re a good stepping stone for your first cooking lessons with small children, but after that, move on. Know exactly what you\u2019re eating, you can\u2019t if it\u2019s coming out of a packet \u2013 even if you did \u2018bake it yourself\u2019. And seriously \u2013 from scratch really isn\u2019t that hard.\nWe\u2019re going to play with the idea of Home Made Junk Food for a few weeks this summer. We\u2019d love you to send in your stories and recipes. What do you take to parties to impress people? Do your kids choose home-made birthday cakes?

But, there are other foods out there that simply have no nutritional value and are so bad for you that they deserve nothing less than to be kicked out of your diet forever. At our holistic gym, Firm Body Evolution, we offer specialized weight loss and detox programs , but by eliminating the following three foods for good, you can be well on your way towards a healthier lifestyle:\n1. White bread/ rice. These bleached products are stripped of any nutritional value and instead sit in your stomach doing nothing for your body except converting carbs into stored fats (great). By simply switching to wheat bread and brown rice, you are eating foods that are chock full of vitamins and minerals - so you don't have to feel guilty about having a second helping.\n2. Fast food. Just don't do it. From soda, to french fries, to chemically processed frozen beef, stopping at a fast food restaurant is never worth it. Instead, replace soda with soda water and fresh juice, bake the fries instead of frying them and buy organic ground beef. Not only will the meal taste better, but you'll feel better afterward, too.\n3. Creamy salad dressing. As the Huffington Post health blog points out, \"You were so good to order a salad, but then canceled out the low-cal benefits by drenching the salad in fattening creamy dressing. Just a few tablespoons of creamy dressing contain more than 20 grams of fat and hundreds of calories.\" Instead, try an oil and vinegar-based dressing.\n\u00a9 2011 Firm Body Evolution.

Maybe we\u2019ll just have to kidnap my mom and keep her for ransom. ;)\nI\u2019m now spending far too much time worrying over whether the baby will make it\u2019s appearance on time. Not too early. Not too late. But, right when Grandma is visiting please!\nI\u2019ve reached the mark where the baby could arrive at any moment, so if there\u2019s a sudden lull in my posting with no explanation you can send up a prayer and give me a big push!\nBut, enough baby stuff. That\u2019s not really the reason you came here is it? :)\nThis is a healthified version of General Tso\u2019s Chicken. Normally the chicken is coated in the egg white/cornstarch mixture and deep fried till golden brown. This version however is pan fried in a drizzle of oil until crisp and tender, making it not only quick enough to eat on a weeknight, but healthy enough to eat as often as you like.\nThe fact that it requires no special ingredients, pastes or sauces makes it a great last minute dinner too. You could swap out the snow peas for whatever veggies you have on hand in your fridge or freezer. I like to store some fresh ginger in the freezer as well so that it\u2019s there when I need it.\nWe generally like having some sort of stir-fry one night a week because it\u2019s a healthier meal and we love Asian flavours. With it\u2019s sweet and slightly spicy sauce, this one has definitely become a favourite.\nWhat are some of your favourite stir-frys?\n2 cups snow peas, trimmed and halved diagonally\n4 garlic cloves, sliced\n2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger\n3 tablespoons light brown sugar\n2 tablespoons soy sauce\n1/4 \u2013 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes\nChicken and Coating\n1 pound chicken, cut into bite-size pieces\nFor sauce: Mix together water and cornstarch until smooth. Stir in remaining ingredients. Set aside.\nFor chicken: Whisk together egg whites, cornstarch, salt and pepper. Stir in chicken.\nTo cook: Heat skillet over medium-high heat. Add a small amount of oil. Add half of chicken to pan, dripping off excess coating. Cook, stirring occasionally until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from pan, add more oil if necessary and repeat with remaining chicken. Set the chicken aside.\nAdd sauce to skillet and cook until snow peas are tender and sauce is thickened. Add chicken (and any collected juices) to skillet.Toss to coat.\nServe with rice.\n*Make sure to use gluten-free soy sauce if cooking for those who cannot handle wheat.\n* Feel free to add as many veggies as you like.\nHoping and prayin\u2019 your little one arrives safely.\nLike the idea of the cornstarch coating\u2026.I will have to try that!\nJanna M\nI love this recipe and make it all the time!!\nI hope the baby arrives right on time. Enjoy your time with your mom.\nhttp://librariane.blogspot.com ruhama\nYummy!

Speaking of that, what do you do to put ginger in the freezer? Do you peel it first? Chop it? I love using fresh ginger, but find I always waste so much. Love you sister:)\nhttp://kitchensimplicity.com Cheri\nI just freeze it whole, chop off as much as I need and then peel and grate it while it\u2019s frozen. I actually find it easier to grate while it\u2019s frozen. Let me know how it turns out! :)\nHeidi\nJust thought to come back & check this\u2026thanks, I\u2019m very excited to freeze some ginger. I still haven\u2019t made this recipe. Didn\u2019t get peas for quite a while\u2026forgot when I did\u2026and now I\u2019m out again:) Definitely one I want to make though.\nKaren Chesnut\nHeidi, I just wrap the fresh ginger peel & all, in foil, and freeze in freezer bag. freezes very well, when I need a piece, it\u2019s easy to cut off a piece to use\u2026\nhttp://Peasepudding.wordpress.com Alli\nIsn\u2019t Skype a wonderful thing?

I was able to plan when I had mine which made things easier. And my mom was there for all three. Nothing like mom when you\u2019re needing love and comfort AND help!\nBridget\nJust made this and it\u2019s incredible! I didn\u2019t have any cornstarch so I used all-purpose flour instead and it worked great..Do you think whole wheat flour would work just as well?\nhttp://kitchensimplicity.com Cheri\nGood to hear! :) I\u2019ve never tried the recipe with flour so I\u2019m not sure how whole wheat would turn out. As a general rule if I\u2019m subbing whole wheat for all-purpose I only substitute half, otherwise it gets too heavy. But you can try whatever you like. :)\nhttp://cookiescupcakesandcardio.com Jenn (Cookies Cupcakes Cardio)\nYour dish looks so tasty!

The egg-cornflour marinade is actually called \u2018velveting\u2019, it\u2019s a traditional Chinese technique to make meat extra tender. I\u2019ve velveted chicken and then poached it before but this was my first time frying it. Thanks for the recipe, Cheri!\nhttp://www.healthycultivations.com Michele @ Healthy Cultivations\nThis looks like a wonderful version. I made something similar recently, and I think I\u2019ll try your version next time. Beautiful blog, by the way. I just found it today and look forward to reading more.\nhttp://belleofthekitchen.blogspot.com Dorothy at Belle of the Kitchen\nI know you will love having your Mom around! What a blessing.\nGeneral Tso is my husband\u2019s favorite, but the fried-factor is way too much for me (in fact, the last time he ordered it, it came with no vegetables at all, only a big bowl of fried chicken and rice.) He\u2019ll love me forever for making this version at home.\nPingback: Two Recipes and A Baby\nhttp://www2seeeeesters.blogspot.com/ Cheryl Keller\nWow your recipe looks wonderful i cant wait to make it, thanks so much for sharing it, keep um coming, Cheryl\nhttp://passthesushi.com/ Kita\nJust tried this out tonight and it was very good.

Lately we have had to cut down on our eating out so that we can really focus on being healthy. When we do go out it is more of a treat and we are starting to pick healthier options.\nI have never had potstickers before. (That was until a few months ago) When I go out to eat\u00a0Asian\u00a0food I tend to\u00a0survive\u00a0the buffets\u00a0solely\u00a0on the sushi and egg drop soup. Yum! But, when we decide to spend the day down in Detroit so we could take lil m to the only Lego brand store in the state (I bought a VW Van Lego set!) , we were limited on options that were not overly priced and overly crowded with hungry folks wanting their Sunday dinner. We opted for TGIFridays because I knew they had some menu changes and had made a shift to healthier options. Big M and I decided to have a treat and share the potsticker appetizer. A few months prior we tried it and I only had 2. They were pretty good.\nGreasy, but good.\nUpon making this choice to order them I thought for sure lil m would share in them as well. She was not interested in anything but her chicken fingers and fries at this point. After sharing that appetizer and knowing how much Big M loved them - I had to find a way to make them healthier for us so we could enjoy them at home.\nI landed on SparkPeople's recipe site - Sparkrecipes : Baked Potstickers\nI've never been very good at following recipes. I tend to improvise and create my own mess when I feel like it. So I did not follow this recipe exact. (You can scroll to the bottom for the full recipe or click the link above.)\nThis is 1lb ground pork (on sale for $1.10), shredded cabbage (on sale for 49c), a handful of baby carrots I already had on hand, and 1 egg. The recipe called for 3 green onions but I used regular white onions instead because I already had those on hand. We go through TONS of onions so I buy the large bag at Kroger for about $2 for 10 small onions. Then I added the hoisin sauce as directed but also included some light sodium soy sauce, a dash of garlic powder , dash of onion powder, and \u00a0a few dashes of Frank's Red Hot. Oh, and the diced celery.\nI then used a tiny spoon to put the mixture inside the won ton wrapper and used the crimper to seal them shut. (Make sure you get them a little wet first or they don't stick shut)\nThen I tossed a bag of frozen stir fry in the wok to add some vegetables to our plate.\nI found that we had quite a few leftovers so the next day I sprayed some cooking spray in the wok and warmed up the potstickers. Even better. I think next time I bake them I will then pan fry in cooking spray for a second. Next time I make them I am going try using Boca crumbles instead of the pork. I switched out the hamburger last week for these....Big M had no idea until I told him. :)\nHere is the recipe:\nIngredients 10 oz ground pork (sub turkey or chicken ) 1/2c shredded cabbage 5 baby carrots diced 3 green onions sliced 1 egg 1T hoisin sauce 1/2c diced celery Won ton wrappers\nDirections Beat egg, add pork and finely chopped veggies.

Nutrients that play an important role in keeping you healthy include minerals, protein, carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins. To run all of your body systems, support normal growth and development, and provide you with sufficient energy, your body needs the right kind and right amount of food and nutrition.\nFood and nutrition is not rocket science. Some of the most important steps you can take to start eating nutritiously are to eat a variety of foods; go easy on the salt, sugar, fat, and alcohol; and drink lots of water. To improve your diet now, start consuming low-fat or fat-free dairy products, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean meats. You should also exercise regularly and gradually decrease your food portions in order to prevent weight gain.\nThere is No Magic Bullet\nWhen it comes to food and nutrition, there is no magic bullet. There are so many short-term, fad diets out there, but they are harmful in the long run. These diets may help you lose weight quickly, but their results aren\u2019t sustainable and they can be detrimental to your health. Also, don\u2019t make the mistake of believing that you can get all of the nutrients you need by taking a vitamin pill each day. Vitamins may supplement your diet, but they can\u2019t replace healthy food and nutrition.\nTake It Slowly\nThe key to making lasting food and nutrition changes is to take it slowly. If you try to make drastic changes overnight, you most likely won\u2019t be able to stick with it and you\u2019ll end up feeling guilty when you fail to achieve your goals. Even small changes can make a massive difference over time. For example, you could simply commit to eating one salad per day and drinking more water. These changes might seem miniscule, but they\u2019ll get you on the path to healthy eating in no time.\nOther changes that you can start making to your diet include using healthy cooking methods, such as grilling, baking, and broiling; switching to low-fat dairy products; adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet; and drinking water instead of sugar-sweetened fruit juice, iced tea, etc. Another easy way to give your diet a boost is by trying new foods. The more colorful your diet is, the healthier it probably is. So, don\u2019t hesitate to try new fruits, vegetables, and grains because it\u2019ll help to ensure that your body is getting all of the nutrients it needs.\nTips for Setting Food and Nutrition Goals\nTo ensure that you are successful in implementing these food and nutrition changes, make specific, measurable goals. For example, instead of making a general goal, such as \u201cI\u2019m going to cut the fat out of my diet,\u201d make a highly specific goal, such as \u201cI am going to bake or broil all of my meat instead of frying it.\u201d\nMake realistic goals that are actually attainable, and make sure you set a deadline for each goal so you can stay focused. You should know exactly what you will be doing and when. If you want to push yourself, set big food and nutrition goals, but divide them into smaller, achievable steps.\n\u00c2\n"}, {"score": 1025.7804, "uuid": "e8df3c5f-3581-5abb-a0c2-0d56279932ea", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-17-16132", "target_hostname": "journeytoahealthieryou.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://journeytoahealthieryou.wordpress.com/", "page_rank": 1.4611182e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Journey <em>To</em> A <em>Healthier</em> You | Striving for a better quality of life", "snippet": "The recipe <em>is</em> from Vegan Junk <em>Food</em>, I\u2019ve made sweet potato <em>fries</em> before but this <em>is</em> my favorite way <em>to</em> season them.

Study participants, all white and without a history of diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular disease, were asked to complete food consumption questionnaires on a yearly basis, and were asked about the use of postmenopausal hormones, smoking status, body weight and level of activity every two years.\nWomen who consumed the most potatoes had a 13% increased risk of type 2 diabetes than those who ate the least potatoes. As the women's BMI ( Body Mass Index ) increased, their increased risk also went up--to 18%. French fry eaters, however, had a 65% higher risk of type 2 diabetes compared to those women who ate the least amount of french fries. After controlling for the additional risk factor of a higher BMI, the relative additional risk decreased to 29%--meaning that women who ate more french fries tended to have a higher Body Mass Index. After controlling even further for additional risk factors such as trans fat intake and total calories, the relative risk again decreased to 21%.\nThe increased risk of type 2 diabetes in this study was stronger when the women replaced whole-grain foods with potatoes or french fries, and those women tended to be obese as well as sedentary.\nWhat this means for you\nPotatoes are a good source of fiber and shouldn't be removed from your diet altogether. Commercially prepared french fries, however, are high in fat--especially trans fats. Bake them at home instead, using this Baked French Fries recipe. Taste tests have shown that people like oven-baked french fries as well as deep fried. Instead of that bag of chips at lunch? Have a piece of fruit. Instead of baked or mashed potatoes, try substituting corn on the cob , squash , brown rice, pasta, grits , couscous or whole wheat pasta.\n"}, {"score": 1000.03986, "uuid": "225bfe0f-76a9-56e9-a90a-e0bed0b324d8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1206wb-43-15358", "target_hostname": "www.thearmeniankitchen.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thearmeniankitchen.com/2009/10/bolsetsi-kuftehor-is-it.html", "page_rank": 1.5934039e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "...or <em>is</em> <em>it</em>?", "snippet": "<em>It</em> doesn\u2019t matter where you live, what your ethnic background <em>is</em>, whether your <em>food</em> preparation skills are very basic <em>to</em> highly professional, or what your finances are, everybody has <em>to</em> eat.", "explanation": null, "document": "C elebrating a heritage of Armenian recipes\nThursday, October 29, 2009\nBolsetsi Kufteh...or is it?\nIn the Southern U.S., a recipe called \"Porcupine Meatballs\" combines ground beef with chopped onion, rice, seasonings.

It had recipes on it for things like the carrot cake recipe that makes the sunflower seeds turn budgerigar green; the rabbit and puy lentil stew that went down so well that time in Oxford; the salad dressing that had everyone from the Britwitch New Forest camp asking for it; and the chilli that has more chocolate in it than any sane person would think sensible, until tasting.\nThere currently is no food section on this website. In fact, most of the legacy pages \u2014 the science, the not-pagan, the megalithomania, the short fiction and the other weblog \u2014 have not made it across. This is mostly not much of an issue and I have no intention of putting it back. However, I think I might need a new food section.\nCooking is one of my interests. I take it seriously. It\u2019s not because I harbour any great ambition to carve out my living as a chef, otherwise I\u2019d enter Masterchef; I\u2019m one of those people who takes any given interest seriously. If a thing is interesting enough for me to spend time doing it, it\u2019s interesting enough for me to get good at it. I do things properly.\nI\u2019m also synaesthetic, and my synaesthesia is a taste/smell/shape sort of affair. Flavours and aromas are important to me because my life is imbued with them.\nRecently I had a stomach upset, which has left me unable to tolerate animal products in any great quantity. I\u2019m not best pleased about this. While I have no issue with other people making whatever choice they wish to make about their diet, I tried vegetarianism before, for a number of years, and I didn\u2019t thrive on it. I\u2019ve always been healthier with flesh in my diet.\nThe other issue is that I\u2019m intolerant of tomatoes and peppers (and, more recently, of wheat) and we can\u2019t have nuts in the house because Frood is allergic in a get-him-to-hospital-pronto sort of a way. This has left us with what would seem to be a fairly restrictive diet. And it\u2019s about now that my years-long obsession with food and diet and nutrition comes into its own.\nWe\u2019re eating more Japanese. We\u2019re looking at classical cuisines from the Far East, where it took longer for the ubiquitous American foodstuffs of peppers, potatoes and tomatoes to penetrate. I\u2019m discovering new ways of flavouring and balancing seasoning, and I\u2019m doing it all without recourse to the junk food option of tubs with obfuscated ingredients.\nI managed some vegetarian stovies recently, a recipe simple enough that it can be deduced from the series of photos on my Flickr site . They were quite nice.\nWhat we were missing, though, was a recipe for macaroni cheese, one of the great comfort foods. I decided that I would make it my mission to come up with a wheat-free, dairy-free alternative. It\u2019s not macaroni cheese and it tastes only very vaguely cheesy, however \u2014 and it does pain me to say this, for reasons with which Munky will be only too familiar \u2014 it does bear a comforting resemblance to macaroni cheese. And it\u2019s quite nice in and of itself.\nSo, because it has been requested, here is how to make it,\nWheat, gluten and dairy-free savoury pasta in the style of macaroni cheese\nServes, er, probably 4. 2 hungry cyclists if served with garlic bread.

They really taste just like curly fries if you do them this way, but no yucky processed stuff! We eat them a lot too!

My MIL, SIL and I split a 5 gallon tub and so it was really affordable.

I don\u2019t use the really strongly flavored kind, because it\u2019s just more expensive and my husband doesn\u2019t care for it. You could definitely do this with olive oil, too, which is how I used to do mine.

I can\u2019t get over that taste. In fact, it makes me feel sick. But I am not sure the one that has the neutral taste is okay to use. I\u2019ve always used olive oil to do the same thing in the oven with potatoes. We enjoy them too!\nAs for the blue potoates I think that is great. This year I also tried to use many different coloured veggies, mainly since I thought it was neat myself and also since I think its a great way to get a child even more interested in gardening. My 3 year old thought it was great that the beans and some carrots (heirloom here too) were purple, since that is her favourite colour. We also grew a neat lettuce called \u201cdarkness\u201d that she happily ate even though it was fairly bitter just because it was a deep dark red colour. Next year I want to do even more coloured things that are out of the ordinary. I find it amazing that God made so many different beautiful vegetables and fruits and its sad that we can\u2019t get them anymore unless we grow them ourselves or perhaps at a farmer\u2019s market. The purple carrots (and white and pinkish ones) that I grew tasted just the same as the orange ones do and it was neat to not know the colour we would get as we pulled them up (it was a mixed seed pack). My daughter loved it.\nReply\nJen October 6, 2009 at 8:43 am\nThese look so simple and delicious! I happen to think that blue potatoes are just a teensy bit sweeter than regular old potatoes, but in a blind taste test I agree that you wouldn\u2019t know the difference.

It steams them and makes the insides soft and the outsides crispy.

When you cook for yourself and your family, you control what goes into the recipe.\nTry these 10 simple substitutions to make your meals healthier. Try the recipe from Brigham and Women's Hospital that is included here as well.\nInstead of: Oil in cakes and brownies\nUse this: Substitute applesauce for half of the oil called for in cake and brownie recipes. You'll cut down on calories without losing flavor or texture. Unsaturated oils, such as olive, canola, safflower and corn oil, are heart healthy, but high in calories. By reducing the amount, you cut back on some of the calories.\nInstead of: Whole eggs\nUse this: A 1/4 cup of egg substitute or two egg whites can replace each egg in recipes. This can cut the calories and cholesterol from your recipes.\nInstead of: All-purpose flour\nUse this: Substitute whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour to increase the fiber in your recipes. Start slowly by using 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all-purpose flour. If you want to go all whole wheat, substitute 7/8 cup whole wheat flour for every cup of white flour.\nInstead of: Cream in soups\nUse this: Try using fat-free (skim) milk in cream-based soup recipes or when baking. One exception: With homemade whipped cream, the fat is important!\nInstead of: Pasta\nUse this: There are so many tasty and nutritious whole wheat pastas on grocery shelves. Some brands even add omega-3 fatty acids \u0097 an essential, heart-healthy fat \u0097 to their whole wheat pastas for added nutrition.\nInstead of: Ground beef\nUse this: You won't be able to tell the difference when you substitute extra-lean ground beef, ground chicken or ground turkey breast in chili, burgers, meatballs or lasagna. Think of all the calories and saturated fat you'll be cutting out!\nInstead of: White rice\nUse this: Brown rice has more fiber and nutrients than white rice. Try it in stir fries or any recipes that call for rice. It's more filling because of the fiber.\nInstead of: Cheese\nUse this: There are a lot of delicious reduced-fat cheeses available today. Replacing full-fat cheese with these lower fat versions will cut back on calories and saturated fat without compromising flavor.\nInstead of: Sour cream\nUse this: Substituting fat-free yogurt for sour cream won't change the flavor or texture of your recipes. It will cut the calories and saturated fat in your dish, and make you feel better about eating your meal!\nInstead of: Salt\nUse this: Put away the garlic salt, onion salt or any other herb-salt combination and use fresh herbs and spices whenever possible. If you can't use fresh, dried herbs and spices are great alternatives! The only thing you lose is the sodium, not the flavor.\nWhy It Matters\nThe news and magazines are filled with tips and ideas on how to cut back on calories, increase fiber and reduce sodium. But it may not always be clear why these are important changes to make to your diet. Here's why:\nCutting down on calories in meals and snacks can help you control your weight. A healthy weight decreases your risk for many diseases, including type 2 diabetes.\nEating more fiber can help keep you full longer. It's also good for your heart and keeps your intestines working properly.\nLooking for ways to cut back of sodium can help decrease your risk of hypertension (high blood pressure).\nAlthough it's possible to do this with pre-made foods, cooking at home is also a great way to monitor your intake!\nPineapple-Cranberry Oat Twist\nMakes 12 portions, 1/2 cup each\nOat Topping:\n3/4 cup old fashioned rolled oats\n1/3 cup whole wheat pastry flour\n1/2 cup pecans, coarsely chopped\n1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar\n1/4 tsp ground cinnamon\n"}, {"score": 941.193, "uuid": "ee634e79-dda3-51c0-8cde-f3b981b5a2df", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0908wb-98-14924", "target_hostname": "www.sharmispassions.com", "target_uri": "http://www.sharmispassions.com/2010/11/broccoli-stir-fry.html", "page_rank": 1.4580235e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Broccoli Stir <em>Fry</em> | Sharmis Passions", "snippet": "Beautiful clicks and a yummy stir <em>fry</em>, Broccoli <em>is</em> a fav of mine too... broccoli <em>is</em> <em>healthier</em> <em>than</em> cauliflower. you can also make kootu with <em>it</em>. broccoli <em>is</em> <em>healthier</em> <em>than</em> cauliflower. you can also make kootu with <em>it</em>.

Collins\nDeseret News\nPublished: Sunday, May 23, 2010\nOne day recently, adults dressed as a carrot, a banana and a poached egg walked into the cafeteria at East Midvale Elementary. Good food choices help you stay healthy, the grown-ups in the costumes told the children sitting at the lunch tables. The children broke into an impromptu chant \u2014 \"We love bananas!\" \u2014 and one of them gave the carrot a high-five.\nWhat happened next underscores the challenge of school lunch.\nLike many districts in Utah, Canyons School District is trying to teach children about nutrition and is making its lunches more healthful, so the menu that day included fresh blueberries and raw pepper slices. There were indeed good food choices, and there were children making them.\nBut there were also students who bypassed the fresh fruit and vegetable station and concentrated on the bags of chips that were also on the menu. Some students licked the whipped cream off their blueberries and spit the fruit out. At one table, a little boy unwrapped the sack lunch he brought from home, ate the ham, tossed the apple and proved that oh yes he can stuff an entire Ding Dong in his mouth. Most kids washed their food down with chocolate milk \u2014 except for the ones who brought lunch from home; they mostly drank fruit punch or soda pop.\nSchool lunch in Utah \u2014 whether served by the school or brought from home \u2014 is a complicated affair, full of improvements and promise but also constrained by tight budgets, uninformed parents and picky eaters raised on sugar, fat and salt. School lunch is the moment where what the experts know about fueling young brains and bodies meets reality. Where \"fresh food is better than processed\" smacks up against \"it's too expensive.\" Where \"chocolate milk contains twice as much sugar as regular milk\" runs headlong into \"but it's what kids want.\"\nHang around in school lunchrooms in Utah and you'll be both encouraged and dismayed.\nThis spring, the reputation of school lunch took a beating.\n\"Too fat to fight,\" declared more than 100 retired military leaders last month about America's teens, citing high-calorie school lunches as one reason. \"More likely to be overweight,\" reported researchers at the University of Michigan about middle school children who eat school lunch.\nThen along came British TV chef Jamie Oliver and his \"Food Revolution,\" which made high drama of efforts to change the school lunch program in a West Virginia town whose obesity and diabetes rates are among the highest in the nation.\nSchool lunch has had a bad rap for decades, but recently America has discovered how pudgy it really is, so efforts have intensified to make changes. And the concern isn't just about weight, says Primary Children's Medical Center dietitian Pauline Williams. Food choices are tied directly to future risk of heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis, blindness and certain cancers. And even small, subclinical micronutrient deficiencies can lead to poor classroom performance, says national nutrition expert John Berardi.\nUtah is not in the vanguard of school lunch reform (that would be places like California where \"Renegade Lunch Lady\" Ann Cooper changed the Berkeley Unified School District's menus from processed cheese nachos to healthy meals made from scratch). But Utah isn't bringing up the rear, either.\nIf school lunch indeed contributes to obesity, evidence suggests Utah is doing something right, or at least less wrong. The National Survey of Children's Health data shows Utah's children are the least overweight in the nation: 23.1 percent, compared to 31.6 nationwide. Still, that's nearly one in four children who weigh more than is healthy.\nAll the blame for the extra pounds can't be placed on school lunch. There are the doughnuts and sugar-laden fruit drinks at the end of Saturday soccer games and the hours spent playing video games instead of riding bikes. There are the sugar cereals and the fast food burger that is cheaper than a pound of apples. Research suggests the most reliable predictor of obesity in the United States is poverty.\nSo school lunch isn't the only culprit, but it's a starting point for change.\nOne day last month, first grade teacher Christi Paulson stood in the lunch line at Riley Elementary in the Salt Lake School District and cringed at the selection: corn chips with a little scoop of chili, side dishes of corn and apple sauce, a small bag of cookies. Except for the chili, the lunch had a pale yellow cast.\n\"One of the reasons I became a teacher was to try to get kids to eat better,\" says Paulson, who is discouraged by the corn dogs and chocolate milk on the district's menus.\nThe Salt Lake district has made improvements \u2014 it hasn't used deep fat fryers in years, adds whole wheat to its hamburger buns and noodles, has a \"Fresh Fruit and Vegetable\" grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide a good snack twice a week in a dozen grade schools \u2014 but nutrition advocate Paulson and others aren't satisfied that the district is doing enough.\nA group of parents from several east-side schools is visiting other districts to see what's possible, hoping to change the menu in Salt Lake. Their first foray was to Oak Hollow Elementary in Draper, where they watched lots of students take spinach and kiwi from the salad bar.\n\"I stood next to the trash,\" says parent Ashley Hoopes. \"I would say 85 to 90 percent of the food was eaten.\" That's not true at her son's school, she says.\nHoopes is bothered that some districts, including Salt Lake, offer students an alternative \"meal\" containing sugary yogurt, cookies and carrots. \"There's a day's worth of sugar in just that meal alone,\" she frets. She worries that students' blood sugar spikes and then falls later, while they're trying to learn.\nSugar content is not one of the elements the National School Lunch Program tracks in its nutritional recommendations.\nThe program was started at the end of World War II to use surplus crops and feed the nation's children, who didn't always have adequate nutrition. It's a permanent program that must still be reauthorized and fine-tuned every five years.\nThe Child Nutrition Act now making its way through Congress would give the Department of Agriculture authority to set national nutrition standards for all foods sold in schools \u2014 not just the entr\u00e9e, as it does now, but the \"competitive\" pizza, the ?la carte chicken patties, the candy in the school store, the sodas in the vending machines. The bill would also fund school gardens and use local food; increase training for food service staff; ban trans fats; and raise what the government pays for each free lunch by 6 cents.\nThis year the USDA will also update federal nutrition standards, and it's expected to follow the recommendations of the federal Institute of Medicine, requiring dark green and orange vegetables (high in micronutrients) and legumes each week, with \"limits on starchy vegetables.\"\nNothing on the menus stirs more debate than chocolate milk, a crowd pleaser that's chosen about five times as often as lower-calorie white milk.\nHealthy-choice advocates hate that the popular pint has 24 grams of sugar, compared to 12 naturally occurring grams of sugar in regular milk.\n\"If we got chocolate milk out of the school system, it would be my career ultimate moment,\" says Riley teacher Paulson.\nOn the other side are lunch program administrators, local to national, who argue the need kids have for milk's calcium and vitamin D outweigh other considerations. They have no plans to dump it, although many Utah districts will serve the non-fat version next year.\nJordan District is particularly concerned about how little milk adolescent girls consume, says Jana Cruz, district food director. They have only so many years to build the calcium stockpile that will keep their bones healthy and their spines straight. \"We feel like it's worth getting sugar to get the calcium. Hopefully, at some point we'll all be educated enough to want to drink white milk.\"\nWhite milk demonstrates one of school lunch's greatest challenges: \"Unless they eat it, it's not nutritious,\" Granite School District food services director Rich Prall says.\nAnd unless they eat it, the lunch program won't have as many customers and lunch programs are also a business that needs to stay afloat. So when districts make changes to their menus they often try to \"sneak\" foods in, says Salt Lake nutrition director Kelly Orton, adding more whole wheat to the pasta, for example, or buying low-fat cheese. Other times they just make a bold move \u2014 switching to sweet potato fries, as Granite and others have done, adding edamame and veggie hummus wraps to its menus, as Park City did.\n\"We had so many people who said, 'Those kids won't eat that spinach salad,'\u2009\" says Annette Richter, food coordinator in the Davis District. But the district stuck to its guns. Maybe by the time these grade schoolers are in junior high they'll demand more salads. But right now when lunch ladies at South Davis Junior High serve food for a school population of 980, they prepare just four salads.\nMichelle Obama's Child Obesity Task Force recently reported that 90 percent of schools nationwide offer kids low-fat menu options, but in only about 20 percent did the average lunch selected meet standards for fat. That includes secondary schools, where students have more choices that currently aren't covered by federal nutrition guidelines.\nHow much can a school district fly in the face of children's tastes? When the Salt Lake District took away sugary cereals in its school breakfast program nine years ago, the children refused the alternative. \"We keep trying,\" says Orton. Now they offer two unsweetened cereals, \"but we only have a few students who take it.\"\nMany school districts are trying to override taste buds trained to crave salt, sugar and fat by showcasing other food choices with fun facts, tantalizing pictures and samples you can bite into \u2014 including jicima and star fruit.\nBut most school districts also still make their entrees look like versions of fast food \u2014 and even though it might be a healthier version (nuggets and corn dogs breaded in whole wheat and baked not fried), the choices still send the message that the best food is fast food.\nStudies show it can take up to 25 times of getting a child to try a food before he'll like it, says dietitian Williams, who has expertise in pediatric weight management.\n\"If you put apples, oranges, bananas and cookies out, most students would choose the cookies,\" she says. \"But if you don't offer the cookies they'll eat the fruit and enjoy it. I say let's offer the healthy foods. They will eventually choose them.\"\nLast year, Granite District served 91,000 pounds of chicken nuggets, Salt Lake nearly 50,000.\nProcessed foods like chicken nuggets and instant potatoes are cheaper to serve than meals made from scratch. \"That's the reality of serving 50,000 lunches a day,\" says Prall. \"You're not going to be peeling potatoes.\"\nIn fact, the cost of food preparation increases the more you handle the food, says Pam Tsakalos, director of nutrition for Davis. So does the chance of foodborne illnesses.\nDavis' state-of-the-art \"cook and chill\" kitchen can produce 70,000 whole wheat bread sticks, bake 9,000 rolls an hour, simmer 900 gallons of chili, cook 800 pounds of roast in a single cook tank\u2014 all at the same time, with a staff of only 19 cooks. It's done from scratch, but much of the process is automated.\nMoney lurks at the heart of every challenge facing school lunch. Districts wrestle with the higher cost of nutritious foods, the federal government must decide if it can afford six cents more for every free lunch when the nation faces massive debt, and families packing lunch from home know chips are cheaper than fresh fruit.\nThe federal government reimburses all or part of the cost of school lunch. ($2.68 for every free lunch, $2.28 if it's a reduced-price subsidy, 24 cents when a family pays full price.) That federal contribution helps districts charge reasonable rates. In Utah, the range in public schools is $1.10 in Carbon and Ogden districts to $1.95 in Wayne District.\nDistricts leverage the federal commodities program to buy more food. The White House task force report notes \"great improvements in the nutritional profile\" of foods the UDSA gives to schools as commodities, with less fat, sodium and sugar \"in many of its offerings.\"\nIn bygone days, a truck might pull up with a load of beans and the district had to deal with it. Now, says Davis' Tsakalos, districts can choose what they want from the offerings. Davis has chosen to put much more emphasis on getting fresh fruits and vegetables.\nWhen Granite District began its fruit and vegetable \"nutrition stations,\" food costs went up between 5 and 10 cents. But Prall says waste went down as more students ate what they picked for themselves.\nAnd sometimes the savings come from simple solutions. When Davis District saw students taking a bite out of their apples and tossing them, they started slicing the apples. Same with the oranges. It's more kid-friendly, and kids are throwing less in the garbage.\nTV chef Jamie Oliver spent all spring snubbing the chicken nuggets and pizza at schools in West Virginia, at one point equating processed food with crack cocaine. He favors school lunch made from scratch, using fresh ingredients.\nBut what, realistically, is possible? Oliver persuaded a local hospital to donate $80,000 to pay for cook training and better food. What happens in towns where the cameras aren't rolling and there isn't a celebrity chef to stir things up?\nIf you want to change your child's lunch program, go through your district, says Charlene Allert, assistant director of the State Office of Education's Child Nutrition Programs. It's at the district level where the menus are made and food ordered.\nAshley Hoopes and the other concerned parents in the Salt Lake District are doing their homework by visiting other lunch programs. They're looking into UCARE, a consortium of 15 districts that have banded together for better buying power.\nAlready in Utah there have been many positive changes: brown rice in Park City, low-fat ranch dressing made from yogurt in Davis, the Canyons' contract with Pizza Hut to create a pizza that's lower in fat.\nBut there can be more.\n\"Find the smallest change that has the biggest impact and start with that,\" suggests nutrition expert Berardi. Maybe that's changing a school menu to include only one dessert a week. Or eliminating high fructose corn syrup. Or having recess before lunch. Or, like some Wasatch Front schools, eliminating sugary birthday treats and classroom rewards like root beer float parties.\nIf you're packing a lunchbox at home, know that the small change with the biggest impact might start in your refrigerator. And with the lessons you teach your child about the foods that will keep him healthy.\nAs Rochelle Creager of Action for Healthy Kids Utah says: \"We will never truly solve the childhood obesity epidemic by focusing solely on the schools \u2014 we need to look inside our own homes and take responsibility for that environment, as well.\"\ne-mail: jarvik@desnews.com \u2013 lois@desnews.com\nImage Caption:\u00a0Colorful fruits have been set out to tempt children as they make their lunchtime food choices at Sandy Elementary on May 14.

Have you lost weight, and then gained it all back once you stopped following a specific diet? You might be surprised to find that the likely culprit is a diet full of gluten-containing processed foods...\nIn 2001, the American Journal of Gastroenterology published a study showing that 39% of the nearly 3 million Americans with celiac disease are overweight at diagnosis, and a full 30% are obese. Many of these people lose their extra weight for good once they stop eating gluten-filled processed foods. You may already know that gluten is dangerous for people who have celiac disease or gluten intolerance, but you don\u2019t have to have these conditions to reap the weight loss benefits of a gluten-free diet.\nWhat Is Gluten?\nGluten is a complex protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and contaminated oats (oats that were processed in a facility that processes gluten-containing foods) that keeps the small intestine from properly absorbing the nutrients that you take in. Gluten is also found in a wide variety of other processed foods and is used as a binder and thickener.\nWheat, barley, and rye are actually genetically derived from wild grasses. Humans, developing as hunters and gatherers, developed these grains in order to provide themselves with a quick source of food and calories. This made it easier for them to obtain food without hunting, as well as to guard against food shortage.\nHowever, many Americans have a certain gene that targets gluten as a foreign protein that affects the immune system. The human immune system isn\u2019t built to recognize or digest the gluten, which contains a toxic chain of amino acids called gliadin. Gliadin is the protein that gives many people, with and without celiac disease, the most trouble in the small intestine. The small intestine is lined with villi, small projections that increase the surface area of the intestine and help with nutrient absorption. Gliadin damages these villi, which can result in your body being unable to absorb nutrients that it needs to stay healthy, slowing down your metabolism and keeping you from losing weight.\nMost breads, pastas, cereals, desserts contain gluten, and eating these carbohydrates can make you feel tired and sluggish and can result in weight gain.\nResearch also indicates that many of these gluten-containing foods are also very high in fat and refined sugar. Eating foods high in refined sugar can cause elevated insulin levels, which often induce cravings for more gluten-filled, processed foods. These foods also encourage your body to produce endorphins, chemicals that make you feel great.\nThis results in a vicious cycle of overeating and weight gain. If you cut the offending, gluten-filled processed foods out of your diet and replace them with gluten-free meals that you make yourself, you\u2019ll reduce your cravings for desserts and carbohydrate-rich processed foods, which will make it much easier to take off those extra pounds.\nWhat Should I Avoid?\nFortunately, you can actually eat more foods than you may think. We\u2019ll discuss those foods later on, but let\u2019s first take a look at the products and foods you should stay away from.\nWheat, Barley, Rye, and Contaminated Oats\nYou know that a gluten-free diet requires you to give up wheat, barley, and rye, but sometimes these grains are hidden in various foods. Barley is used in many food products, including bread, soups, whiskey, and beer. It\u2019s also often combined with wheat flour in recipes for many baked goods and can be found in syrups and some flavorings that are added to foods. It is often found in instant coffee and coffee substitutes. Rye is found in pumpernickel bread and in certain alcoholic beverages, such as some brands of vodka and whiskey.\nWatch out for products that contain the following:\nSemolina: The majority of pasta available at grocery stores is made out of semolina wheat flour. Couscous, which looks similar to rice, is actually made of semolina flour and is therefore classified as a type of pasta.\nDurum: Many of the finest pastas will say \u201cmade from durum semolina.\u201d Durum is the hardest type of wheat.\nOrzo: Very small pasta that is made from semolina.\nFarina: This grain is a type of semolina. It is used in many hot cereals.\nGraham flour: This is unbleached whole wheat flour that is used in many pie crusts.\nBulgur: A type of whole wheat commonly found in cereals, soups, stuffings, and bread.\nKamut: A type of wheat often found in natural foods that are sold in specialty markets. It is considered to be a bit healthier than most wheat flours.\nSeitan: A wheat-based product. Often used as a meat substitute in vegetarian recipes.\nSpelt (a form of wheat) Spelt is often used in breads and pastas and has more protein than other types of wheat.\nTriticale: Triticale is a hybrid grain produced by crossbreeding wheat and rye. It is found in some breakfast cereals.\nOats: This grain is okay for most people on a gluten-free diet. Even people with celiac seem to tolerate oats, but some people can have a reaction. It is best buy oats that are labeled gluten-free.\nFoods to Avoid\nAvoid the following foods if they are not labeled as being gluten-free, if you see gluten-containing ingredients listed on the label, or if they might be cross-contaminated:\nBreads: All white, wheat, rye, and sourdough breads are made with gluten. Gluten firms up when its cooked, which helps to maintain the shape of bread and gives bread its chewy texture.\nCakes and pies: Unless labeled gluten-free, cakes and pies are usually made with gluten-containing flour.\nCandy: Pure chocolate and cocoa have no gluten, and many chocolate-based candy bars are gluten-free. Several candy companies, like See\u2019s, offer a selection of gluten-free chocolate treats. Avoid candy bars with a \u201ccookie\u201d component to them. The cookie in the candy is often made with gluten-containing flour. Several brands of chewing gum are safe, such as Wrigley\u2019s and Bubble Yum.\nLuncheon meats: If you buy sliced meat at your deli counter, ask them to carefully clean the slicer before slicing your meat to avoid cross-contamination.\nCereals: Most are high in gluten unless made with only gluten-free grains.\nCookies.\nCroutons.\nEnhanced rice or flavored rice dishes.\nFrozen vegetables with sauce packets: The sauce in the packets is made with thickeners that often contain flour.\nGravy, both packaged and bottled: Many gravies begin with a roux base, which consists of butter and flour for thickening.\nImitation bacon bits: May contain gluten, which is often found in additives and preservatives.\nImitation meat or seafood.\nPasta.\nSelf-basting poultry.\nSalad dressings: Several brands of salad dressings are gluten-free, such as Annie\u2019s Naturals and Organicville, but some manufacturers and many restaurants may add gluten for thickening.\nSauces and marinades (including soy sauce): Some soy sauces are gluten-free, but many are not. It is best to avoid all premade marinades in restaurants including teriyaki sauce.\nSoups: Canned and boxed soups use wheat as a thickener. Do not buy any commercial bouillon cubes or soup stock without reading the label. Most restaurants use gluten-containing ingredients in their soup base. Make sure to inquire before ordering soup.\nAlso, there are many beverages that may contain gluten, including cocoa mixes, root beer, chocolate drinks, and various beverage mixes.\nHidden Gluten\nThere are many foods, beverages, and nonfood products that contain hidden gluten. It may not be obvious when reading a label that a food or beverage contains gluten, because a product can be labeled gluten-free but still contain barley, malt, or rye. The following is a list of places where gluten may be hiding:\nBaking powder.\nBeer: lager, stout, and ale\nBouillon cubes and powder.\nCheese: Most cheese is naturally gluten-free, but it could become contaminated during manufacturing. It is best to buy cheese that is packaged and labeled gluten-free.\nChili powder.\nFlavored coffees.\nFried foods: Many fried foods have gluten in the batter. In addition, they may become cross-contaminated if cooked in a pan that was previously used to cook food containing gluten.\nDried fruits: Some companies dust dried fruit with flour, so read labels carefully.\nFoods sold in bins: Most of these foods contain gluten. The gluten could come from a previous gluten-containing food that was in the same bin last week.\nFrench fries: Avoid most frozen fries and French fries cooked in a restaurants, due to cross-contamination.\nImitation seafood: The fillers might contain wheat starch.\nLemonade: Commercial lemonade often contains malt and/or barley.\nModified food starch: If the source of the modified food starch is wheat starch, it is not safe. In the United States, if you see the word \u201cstarch\u201d on the label it means cornstarch, which is safe.\nNuts: Read the small print on packages. Often nuts are processed in a plant that processes wheat. Therefore, there might be cross-contamination.\nSalad dressing and mayonnaise: Most are safe, but watch out for barley malt as an ingredient in salad dressing. The dressing might say \u201cgluten-free,\u201d but it could contain barley malt.\nSeasoning mixes.\nYogurt (many reduced-fat and flavored varieties).\nWhat Can I Eat?\nThe variety of gluten-free foods include the following:\nFresh meats, fish, and poultry: Avoid bacon and sausage unless they are labeled gluten-free because they might contain gluten fillers. Also avoid meats that are breaded, batter-coated, marinated, or preseasoned, as these coatings and marinades may contain gluten.\nDairy products: The majority of dairy products are gluten-free, but you should avoid cheeses that are sliced in the store because they may be contaminated with gluten. It is best to stick with cheeses that are labeled gluten-free.\nFruits: All fresh fruit, frozen whole fruits with no additives, and fruit juice (100 percent fruit).\nNuts and Seeds (unsalted, raw): All nuts in their pure form are safe as long as they are not coated, but prepacked trail mixes might contain gluten. Seeds and most nut butters are safe. Read labels to be sure.\nVegetables: All fresh vegetables, all frozen vegetables (with no additives, breading, or sauces), all fresh and canned beans, olives, potatoes (all varieties), lentils.\nRice: Stay away from enriched, flavored, or seasoned versions.\nPotatoes: Fresh potatoes are a good choice and, in fact, potato flour and potato starch are used to thicken many gluten-free foods.\nRice noodles.\nBeans and lentils.\nMeats, eggs, soy foods: All fresh lean meats, poultry with no breading or additives, eggs (check the labels on all egg substitutes for gluten-containing ingredients), soybeans (including edamame), tofu, soy milk (plain, unsweetened), soy mayonnaise, and soy butter.\nVinegars (except malt vinegar and grain vinegar): Vinegars, such as red wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar, and balsamic vinegar also do not contain gluten because they do not come from a gluten-containing grain.\nDistilled liquors, ciders, and spirits.\nArrowroot: Arrowroot is a plant that is found in a rainforest-type climate. This particular starch is easy to digest and is great for thickening soup and gravy in gluten-free cooking.\nFlours: Coconut flour, carob flour, chestnut flour, garbanzo bean flour, soy flour, and potato flour are all gluten-free ingredients.\nSpices: Only buy spices in their pure form and make sure they are fresh. Many specialty markets sell a variety of gluten-free spices.\nHerbs: The best ones are fresh. Dried herbs can be subject to cross-contamination but are usually safe.\nCoffee and Tea: Natural coffees and teas are gluten-free, but instant, decaffeinated, and flavored versions may contain gluten. Avoid drinking coffee that is made by someone else. If they used their coffee maker for gluten-containing coffee, there may be cross-contamination.\nSeafood: All fresh seafood in its natural state is gluten-free, as is all frozen seafood that doesn\u2019t include additives, sauces, or marinades.\nGluten-free breads, cereals, pasta, crackers: Read labels carefully and choose brands made without gluten-containing grains. Some brands include Joan\u2019s GF Great Bakes, Inc., and Arrowhead Mills GF cereals.\nProducts That Are Gluten-Free\nThe following grains are naturally gluten-free, and they are used in many gluten-free recipes. Read labels carefully or check with the manufacturer to verify that these are processed in a gluten-free facility before consuming them.\nAmaranth: This cream-colored flour has a nutty and sweet taste. It is great for making a thick crust and browns quickly. It is also perfect for thickening sauces and gravies and making pancakes, muffins, and pizza dough. You can use amaranth flour to replace up to 1/4 of the total flour in any recipe calling for all-purpose gluten-free flour. It is best used in recipes that do not contain a lot of liquids.\nBuckwheat: You may think that buckwheat is a grain because of its name, but buckwheat is actually a fruit. It is high in fiber and B vitamins, which is a plus for people with celiac disease. Buckwheat is one of the few commercially grown crops that does not use chemicals.\nRice: Pure rice is naturally gluten-free. Flavored, enriched and seasoned rice may contain gluten, so read labels carefully.\nCorn: Flour made from corn makes a great substitute for gluten-containing flours.\nMillet: Rich in nutrients and great to cook with. Read labels carefully to be sure it has been processed in a wheat-free facility.\nQuinoa: This grain provides an excellent source of protein and has a rich flavor.\nFrom The Gluten-Free Edge, Copyright \u00a9 2011 by F+W Media, Inc.

The following is a list of places where gluten may be hiding:\nBaking powder.\nBeer: lager, stout, and ale\nBouillon cubes and powder.\nCheese: Most cheese is naturally gluten-free, but it could become contaminated during manufacturing. It is best to buy cheese that is packaged and labeled gluten-free.\nChili powder.\nFlavored coffees.\nFried foods: Many fried foods have gluten in the batter. In addition, they may become cross-contaminated if cooked in a pan that was previously used to cook food containing gluten.\nDried fruits: Some companies dust dried fruit with flour, so read labels carefully.\nFoods sold in bins: Most of these foods contain gluten. The gluten could come from a previous gluten-containing food that was in the same bin last week.\nFrench fries: Avoid most frozen fries and French fries cooked in a restaurants, due to cross-contamination.\nImitation seafood: The fillers might contain wheat starch.\nLemonade: Commercial lemonade often contains malt and/or barley.\nModified food starch: If the source of the modified food starch is wheat starch, it is not safe. In the United States, if you see the word \u201cstarch\u201d on the label it means cornstarch, which is safe.\nNuts: Read the small print on packages. Often nuts are processed in a plant that processes wheat. Therefore, there might be cross-contamination.\nSalad dressing and mayonnaise: Most are safe, but watch out for barley malt as an ingredient in salad dressing. The dressing might say \u201cgluten-free,\u201d but it could contain barley malt.\nSeasoning mixes.\nYogurt (many reduced-fat and flavored varieties).\nWhat Can I Eat?\nThe variety of gluten-free foods include the following:\nFresh meats, fish, and poultry: Avoid bacon and sausage unless they are labeled gluten-free because they might contain gluten fillers. Also avoid meats that are breaded, batter-coated, marinated, or preseasoned, as these coatings and marinades may contain gluten.\nDairy products: The majority of dairy products are gluten-free, but you should avoid cheeses that are sliced in the store because they may be contaminated with gluten. It is best to stick with cheeses that are labeled gluten-free.\nFruits: All fresh fruit, frozen whole fruits with no additives, and fruit juice (100 percent fruit).\nNuts and Seeds (unsalted, raw): All nuts in their pure form are safe as long as they are not coated, but prepacked trail mixes might contain gluten. Seeds and most nut butters are safe. Read labels to be sure.\nVegetables: All fresh vegetables, all frozen vegetables (with no additives, breading, or sauces), all fresh and canned beans, olives, potatoes (all varieties), lentils.\nRice: Stay away from enriched, flavored, or seasoned versions.\nPotatoes: Fresh potatoes are a good choice and, in fact, potato flour and potato starch are used to thicken many gluten-free foods.\nRice noodles.\nBeans and lentils.\nMeats, eggs, soy foods: All fresh lean meats, poultry with no breading or additives, eggs (check the labels on all egg substitutes for gluten-containing ingredients), soybeans (including edamame), tofu, soy milk (plain, unsweetened), soy mayonnaise, and soy butter.\nVinegars (except malt vinegar and grain vinegar): Vinegars, such as red wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar, and balsamic vinegar also do not contain gluten because they do not come from a gluten-containing grain.\nDistilled liquors, ciders, and spirits.\nArrowroot: Arrowroot is a plant that is found in a rainforest-type climate. This particular starch is easy to digest and is great for thickening soup and gravy in gluten-free cooking.\nFlours: Coconut flour, carob flour, chestnut flour, garbanzo bean flour, soy flour, and potato flour are all gluten-free ingredients.\nSpices: Only buy spices in their pure form and make sure they are fresh. Many specialty markets sell a variety of gluten-free spices.\nHerbs: The best ones are fresh. Dried herbs can be subject to cross-contamination but are usually safe.\nCoffee and Tea: Natural coffees and teas are gluten-free, but instant, decaffeinated, and flavored versions may contain gluten. Avoid drinking coffee that is made by someone else. If they used their coffee maker for gluten-containing coffee, there may be cross-contamination.\nSeafood: All fresh seafood in its natural state is gluten-free, as is all frozen seafood that doesn\u2019t include additives, sauces, or marinades.\nGluten-free breads, cereals, pasta, crackers: Read labels carefully and choose brands made without gluten-containing grains. Some brands include Joan\u2019s GF Great Bakes, Inc., and Arrowhead Mills GF cereals.\nProducts That Are Gluten-Free\nThe\u00a0following grains are naturally gluten-free, and they are used in many gluten-free recipes. Read labels carefully or check with the manufacturer to verify that these are processed in a gluten-free facility before consuming them.\nAmaranth: This cream-colored flour has a nutty and sweet taste. It is great for making a thick crust and browns quickly. It is also perfect for thickening sauces and gravies and making pancakes, muffins, and pizza dough. You can use amaranth flour to replace up to\u00a01/4 of the total flour in any recipe calling for all-purpose gluten-free flour. It is best used in recipes that do not contain a lot of liquids.\nBuckwheat: You may think that buckwheat is a grain because of its name, but buckwheat is actually a fruit. It is high in fiber and B vitamins, which is a plus for people with celiac disease. Buckwheat is one of the few commercially grown crops that does not use chemicals.\nRice: Pure rice is naturally gluten-free. Flavored, enriched and seasoned rice may contain gluten, so read labels carefully.\nCorn: Flour made from corn makes a great substitute for gluten-containing flours.\nMillet: Rich in nutrients and great to cook with. Read labels carefully to be sure it has been processed in a wheat-free facility.\nQuinoa: This grain provides an excellent source of protein and has a rich flavor.\nFrom The Gluten-Free Edge, Copyright \u00a9 2011 by F+W Media, Inc.

But like all processed foods made with refined flour, including white bread and white pasta, it offers very little nutrition in return for raising your blood sugar, and it could be loaded with preservatives, too. If you like rice and want better control of your diabetes, try some of the wild rice blends (as well as whole-grain breads, pastas, and cereals). They take a little longer to cook and they do cost more, but they're healthier and tastier.\nRelated story: Carbohydrates Are Your Diet's Fuel\nFrench Fries\nFew people realize how many calories even a small serving of French fries can contain. This can make managing your weight and your diabetes difficult, especially if you eat them frequently. And like white rice, they don\u2019t offer much in return for their effect on blood sugar levels. If you really like fries, bake them yourself at home, without oil. Use skin-on sweet potatoes and skip the frozen supermarket varieties, which are often loaded with preservatives.\nRelated story: What 500 Calories Looks Like\nCanned Fruit in Heavy Syrup\nEating more fruits and vegetables helps people stay healthy and feel full. If your budget is tight, canned produce is an option -- it lasts longer and tastes good. Unfortunately, if you don\u2019t read labels carefully, you could end up with fruit that has been canned in heavy, sugary syrup. You can lighten the sugar load of these processed foods by draining and rinsing the fruit, but it\u2019s better to buy fruit canned in its own juice instead of syrup.\nRelated story: Are You Addicted To Sugar?\nPotato Chips\nWhen you have to watch your weight, potato chips and other fried snacks can quickly undermine your diet efforts. These processed foods add to your intake of calories, salt, and preservatives without providing much, if any, nutrition or fiber, which can help slow digestion a bit. Plan ahead for those times when you want a crunchy treat and have veggie sticks (cut-up carrots, celery, and zucchini are great) and a low-fat, low-sugar dip you enjoy at the ready.\nRelated story: Everyday Foods Add Up To Major Salt Problems\nSoda\nHaving a lot of sodas, even sugar-free sodas, in your diet frequently correlates with a diabetes diagnosis. Most people switch to sugar-free or try to give up sugary drinks entirely to better manage their diabetes (and their weight). If it\u2019s the tingly sensation of soda you crave, try club soda with a touch of fruit juice for flavor. Go easy on the fruit juice, however, because it's also high in sugar.\nRelated story: How Soda Affects Kids' Health\nFoods With High-Fructose Corn Syrup\nHigh-fructose corn syrup is a common ingredient in many packaged foods like cookies and snack cakes, and it's the focal point of a controversy about its effect on weight, insulin, and health. Many foods that you might not realize contain HCFS actually do, such as sweet pickle relish, ketchup, jams and jellies, and salad dressings. If you\u2019re wary of including this form of sweetener and all its calories in your diabetes diet, simply choose products that list sugar, not high-fructose corn syrup, as an ingredient. Keep in mind though that both sugar and high-fructose corn syrup add calories to food, and try to develop a taste for foods that are less sweet to better manage your type 2 diabetes.\nRelated story: Docs Urge Feds To Assess 'Toxic' Sugar\nProcessed Meats\nAlthough they don\u2019t usually contain sugar, processed meats, which are heavy on salt and preservatives, seem to be linked to an increased risk of diabetes. Instead of relying on lunch meats, deli meats, and various kinds of sausages, go for meat that is closer to its natural state. Try using leftovers from a roasted chicken for a lunchbox sandwich, for example. Also, build in more meatless options for type 2 diabetes control.\nRelated story: Red Meat Can Be Unhealthy, Study Suggests\nFast-Food Hamburgers\nThis fast-food staple may be a diabetes risk factor for you. Research shows that African-American women who eat hamburgers in a restaurant two or more times a week are much more likely to receive a diabetes diagnosis than those who do not. A small, plain hamburger probably isn\u2019t the root of this problem \u2014 it\u2019s more likely that the oversized patties, buns, and toppings are contributing to these statistics.

The other part is that they lack dietary fiber \u2014 and a high-fiber diet has been shown to help prevent and manage diabetes.

But like all processed foods made with refined flour, including white bread and white pasta, it offers very little nutrition in return for raising your blood sugar, and it could be loaded with preservatives, too. If you like rice and want better control of your diabetes, try some of the wild rice blends (as well as whole-grain breads, pastas, and cereals). They take a little longer to cook and they do cost more, but they're healthier and tastier.\nRelated story: Carbohydrates Are Your Diet's Fuel\nFrench Fries\nFew people realize how many calories even a small serving of French fries can contain. This can make managing your weight and your diabetes difficult, especially if you eat them frequently. And like white rice, they don\u2019t offer much in return for their effect on blood sugar levels. If you really like fries, bake them yourself at home, without oil. Use skin-on sweet potatoes and skip the frozen supermarket varieties, which are often loaded with preservatives.\nRelated story: What 500 Calories Looks Like\nCanned Fruit in Heavy Syrup\nEating more fruits and vegetables helps people stay healthy and feel full.

Like I know I need to eat more vegetables, but what if I cook them in such a way they're not good for me anymore? Can you help?\nAlex -- About.com User\nAnswer: When I am researching recipes, there are three main characteristics I look for:\nThe inclusion of healthy ingredients\nThe exclusion of unhealthy ingredients\nThe cooking method\nHere is what you should look for when evaluating a recipe.\nHealthy Ingredients\nThe best ingredients are whole fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, healthy oils like olive oil, walnut oil, grape seed oil, and rice bran oil. Nuts, legumes and soy are healthy ingredients, and so are whole grain breads, and pastas. Meats and poultry should be lean whenever possible, and low fat dairy products are good too. I like recipes that include several healthy ingredients, rather than just one or two. For example, Wild Rice with Cranberries and Apples is a great healthy dish with a great balance of whole grains, nuts, and fruit. Serve this with a lean chicken breast for an incredibly tasty and healthy meal. Pork with Cabbage and Apples is another example of a great recipe with several healthy ingredients.\nLeave Out Unhealthy Ingredients\nUnhealthy ingredients include sugar, processed foods, saturated and trans fat , white refined flour, and products made with refined white flour. Evaluating a recipe can be easy. For example, a recipe that calls for processed foods like luncheon meats, processed cheese-products or high fat products like mayonnaise isn't healthy and should not become a recipe you use very often.\nSometimes evaluating a recipe is more difficult. Spaghetti and meatballs seems like a healthy meal, but a large portion of the meal is pasta made from refined white flour and the meatballs may have a lot of saturated fat in them. On the flip side, the spaghetti sauce itself is very healthy with lots of tomatoes that give us vitamins and lycopene . Garlic, peppers, herbs seasonings and mushrooms are healthy ingredients you might find in a spaghetti recipe.\nWhen you find a recipe that confuses you, just alter the recipe a bit. Make your meatballs from ground turkey meat and use a whole grain pasta, or decrease the serving size and add a big salad on the side.\nCooking Methods\nThe cooking method used in a recipe is very important. Deep-frying is probably the least healthy of the cooking methods, especially if the oil is used more than once. Pan frying might be a little better, but still not so good if you use a lot of oil and batters on your foods that absorb a lot of oil. Sauteing in a bit of olive oil or canola oil is better, and roasting in an oven is better yet. Boiling vegetables will not add any extra calories, but you will loose some of the valuable nutrients when you drain off the cooking water. Microwaving is a great way to cook vegetables because it is quick so not many nutrients are lost.\nHere are a couple examples of recipes prepared with different methods. Potatoes are a nice source of vitamin C and fiber if you leave on the skins. A medium sized baked potato only has about 100 calories and is a healthy food when cooked in this manner. A french-fried potato is not so healthy. The fat used to deep-fry the potato is not healthy, and the potato absorbs a lot of oil, so the same size potato that is french fried has many more calories and fat. If you like french fries, try slicing the potato into strips and lightly coat the strips with olive oil. Bake them on a baking sheet until they are tender.\nAnother example of good verses bad cooking methods would be this example with a chicken breast. Baking a chicken breast in the oven with some salsa or chicken broth is a healthy way to prepare the chicken. If you take that same chicken breast, coat it with a batter and deep fry it, that piece of chicken becomes an unhealthy, fattening food.\nAlways look for healthy ingredients. Avoid unhealthy ingredients or find healthier substitutes.

Potato Chowder\n3. Another easy main dish idea that was a staple in our kitchen growing up was Pork Chops & Rice. \u00a0Simply brown four or five bone in chops in a pan, transfer to a greased baking dish and add one box of Uncle Ben\u2019s original wild rice mix with the herb packet (don\u2019t use the quick cook rice). \u00a0Pour two cups of water into the dish and bake covered for one hour at 350 degrees. \u00a0Serve with some applesauce and you\u2019ve got something different and easy.\n4. \u00a0My grandma made home-made tortellini\u2013I don\u2019t. \u00a0I buy the frozen beef tortellini and add it to about 8 cups of boiling chicken broth. \u00a0Cook until they rise to the top and serve as a soup; top with some grated parmesan cheese. \u00a0It\u2019s delicious and filling and your kids will beg for more. \u00a0My two year old cries when this is all gone.\nSide Dishes:\nSides stress me out. \u00a0I\u2019m always \u00a0scrounging around trying to find something more creative than a tube of crescent rolls. \u00a0I got over the \u201csides need to be home-made too\u201d mental battle a while ago. \u00a0It\u2019s freeing\u2013join me will you?\n1. Alexia Sweet Potato Fries \u2026..These are delicious as are all Alexia products and they can be found in the frozen food aisle of most grocery stores. \u00a0They make a great side to chicken or steak. \u00a0You can bake some broccoli or cauliflower on the same tray and have a vegetable medley blend that will be a hit!\n2. \u00a0Bob Evan\u2019s pre-made mashed potatoes. \u00a0I was skeptical of these too\u2013but they are great. \u00a0They are creamy and you simply zap them in the microwave. \u00a0They have a great little herby taste to them as well that makes people think you did something extra special to them.\n3. Cherry Tomato Crisp \u2026\u2026This is another recipe we featured a while back and is great for incorporating something healthy into your meal. \u00a0If you paired this with a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store you\u2019d have one gourmet looking meal. \u00a0And if getting out a food processor gives you hives you can also use ready-made bread crumbs and flavor them.\n4. \u00a0And my personal favorite\u2026\u2026blister potatoes. \u00a0Wash a few potatoes, slice them in 1/4 inch thick rounds (skin included) and place them right on your oven rack.\u00a0 Bake them at 350 degrees for about 45-50 minutes and watch them blister up as they bake.\u00a0 Grab them off the racks with tongs, srpinkle them with salt and a little butter, and serve with ketchup.\u00a0 These are a great side to acompany hamburgers, grilled chicken, or steak\u2013and they\u2019re a lot healthier than chips or french fries.\nThese ideas are simple and I\u2019m sure you have a million more.\u00a0 I would encourage you to make a list of all your simple dinner ideas and make that your go-to resource instead of biting off more than you can chew when it comes to making dinner and delusions of grandeur.\u00a0 I love cooking\u2013love it.\u00a0 And I love trying new recipes that are complicated and in-depth.\u00a0 But I try and reserve those for Saturday or Sunday nights\u2013when my day has been relatively peaceful and I feel up to the challenge.\u00a0 If you can get yourself in that mind-set about food preparation my guess is that you\u2019ll feel a lot more relaxed and successful when it comes to making dinner around the table a priority.\nVisit my other online home at apairofpinkshoes.com\n"}], [{"score": 881.7537, "uuid": "ba9fd09a-a678-5008-9df0-d7a5ed5ac4a0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1100tw-30-05077", "target_hostname": "www.huffingtonpost.ca", "target_uri": "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/21/worst-processed-foods_n_1370556.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.ca%2F2012%2F03%2F21%2Fworst-processed-foods_n_1370556.html&format=xml", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "10 Processed <em>Foods</em> <em>To</em> Remove From Your Diet Now", "snippet": "That&#x27;s a contradicting answer <em>to</em> your previous posts.

But like all processed foods made with refined flour, including white bread and white pasta, it offers very little nutrition in return for raising your blood sugar, and it could be loaded with preservatives, too. If you like rice and want better control of your diabetes, try some of the wild rice blends (as well as whole-grain breads, pastas, and cereals). They take a little longer to cook and they do cost more, but they're healthier and tastier.\nRelated story: Carbohydrates Are Your Diet's Fuel\nFrench Fries\nFew people realize how many calories even a small serving of French fries can contain. This can make managing your weight and your diabetes difficult, especially if you eat them frequently. And like white rice, they don\u2019t offer much in return for their effect on blood sugar levels. If you really like fries, bake them yourself at home, without oil. Use skin-on sweet potatoes and skip the frozen supermarket varieties, which are often loaded with preservatives.\nRelated story: What 500 Calories Looks Like\nCanned Fruit in Heavy Syrup\nEating more fruits and vegetables helps people stay healthy and feel full. If your budget is tight, canned produce is an option -- it lasts longer and tastes good. Unfortunately, if you don\u2019t read labels carefully, you could end up with fruit that has been canned in heavy, sugary syrup. You can lighten the sugar load of these processed foods by draining and rinsing the fruit, but it\u2019s better to buy fruit canned in its own juice instead of syrup.\nRelated story: Are You Addicted To Sugar?\nPotato Chips\nWhen you have to watch your weight, potato chips and other fried snacks can quickly undermine your diet efforts. These processed foods add to your intake of calories, salt, and preservatives without providing much, if any, nutrition or fiber, which can help slow digestion a bit. Plan ahead for those times when you want a crunchy treat and have veggie sticks (cut-up carrots, celery, and zucchini are great) and a low-fat, low-sugar dip you enjoy at the ready.\nRelated story: Everyday Foods Add Up To Major Salt Problems\nSoda\nHaving a lot of sodas, even sugar-free sodas, in your diet frequently correlates with a diabetes diagnosis. Most people switch to sugar-free or try to give up sugary drinks entirely to better manage their diabetes (and their weight). If it\u2019s the tingly sensation of soda you crave, try club soda with a touch of fruit juice for flavor. Go easy on the fruit juice, however, because it's also high in sugar.\nRelated story: How Soda Affects Kids' Health\nFoods With High-Fructose Corn Syrup\nHigh-fructose corn syrup is a common ingredient in many packaged foods like cookies and snack cakes, and it's the focal point of a controversy about its effect on weight, insulin, and health. Many foods that you might not realize contain HCFS actually do, such as sweet pickle relish, ketchup, jams and jellies, and salad dressings. If you\u2019re wary of including this form of sweetener and all its calories in your diabetes diet, simply choose products that list sugar, not high-fructose corn syrup, as an ingredient. Keep in mind though that both sugar and high-fructose corn syrup add calories to food, and try to develop a taste for foods that are less sweet to better manage your type 2 diabetes.\nRelated story: Docs Urge Feds To Assess 'Toxic' Sugar\nProcessed Meats\nAlthough they don\u2019t usually contain sugar, processed meats, which are heavy on salt and preservatives, seem to be linked to an increased risk of diabetes. Instead of relying on lunch meats, deli meats, and various kinds of sausages, go for meat that is closer to its natural state. Try using leftovers from a roasted chicken for a lunchbox sandwich, for example. Also, build in more meatless options for type 2 diabetes control.\nRelated story: Red Meat Can Be Unhealthy, Study Suggests\nFast-Food Hamburgers\nThis fast-food staple may be a diabetes risk factor for you. Research shows that African-American women who eat hamburgers in a restaurant two or more times a week are much more likely to receive a diabetes diagnosis than those who do not. A small, plain hamburger probably isn\u2019t the root of this problem \u2014 it\u2019s more likely that the oversized patties, buns, and toppings are contributing to these statistics. If you\u2019re eating out, opt for a small, grilled-chicken sandwich with lots of veggies instead. Dr. Hannon recommends researching restaurant menus in advance to plan healthy choices.\nRelated story: Jillian Michaels' 5 Junk Food Rules\nSugary Cereals\nBreakfast cereals in brightly colored boxes are a staple in many households. If you\u2019re guessing that added sugar is part of the problem these processed foods pose for people with diabetes, you\u2019re right. The other part is that they lack dietary fiber \u2014 and a high-fiber diet has been shown to help prevent and manage diabetes. Look for cereals that provide about 5 grams (or more) of fiber per serving and don\u2019t contain large amounts of sugar.\n"}, {"score": 881.7275, "uuid": "bfbdc9d2-56ba-5854-a128-96770b4e1bd0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1100tw-30-05076", "target_hostname": "www.huffingtonpost.ca", "target_uri": "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/21/worst-processed-foods_n_1370556.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.ca%2F2012%2F03%2F21%2Fworst-processed-foods_n_1370556.html&format=json", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "10 Processed <em>Foods</em> <em>To</em> Remove From Your Diet Now", "snippet": "That&#x27;s a contradicting answer <em>to</em> your previous posts.

This can make managing your weight and your diabetes difficult, especially if you eat them frequently. And like white rice, they don\u2019t offer much in return for their effect on blood sugar levels. If you really like fries, bake them yourself at home, without oil. Use skin-on sweet potatoes and skip the frozen supermarket varieties, which are often loaded with preservatives.\nRelated story: What 500 Calories Looks Like\nCanned Fruit in Heavy Syrup\nEating more fruits and vegetables helps people stay healthy and feel full. If your budget is tight, canned produce is an option -- it lasts longer and tastes good. Unfortunately, if you don\u2019t read labels carefully, you could end up with fruit that has been canned in heavy, sugary syrup. You can lighten the sugar load of these processed foods by draining and rinsing the fruit, but it\u2019s better to buy fruit canned in its own juice instead of syrup.\nRelated story: Are You Addicted To Sugar?\nPotato Chips\nWhen you have to watch your weight, potato chips and other fried snacks can quickly undermine your diet efforts. These processed foods add to your intake of calories, salt, and preservatives without providing much, if any, nutrition or fiber, which can help slow digestion a bit. Plan ahead for those times when you want a crunchy treat and have veggie sticks (cut-up carrots, celery, and zucchini are great) and a low-fat, low-sugar dip you enjoy at the ready.\nRelated story: Everyday Foods Add Up To Major Salt Problems\nSoda\nHaving a lot of sodas, even sugar-free sodas, in your diet frequently correlates with a diabetes diagnosis. Most people switch to sugar-free or try to give up sugary drinks entirely to better manage their diabetes (and their weight). If it\u2019s the tingly sensation of soda you crave, try club soda with a touch of fruit juice for flavor. Go easy on the fruit juice, however, because it's also high in sugar.\nRelated story: How Soda Affects Kids' Health\nFoods With High-Fructose Corn Syrup\nHigh-fructose corn syrup is a common ingredient in many packaged foods like cookies and snack cakes, and it's the focal point of a controversy about its effect on weight, insulin, and health. Many foods that you might not realize contain HCFS actually do, such as sweet pickle relish, ketchup, jams and jellies, and salad dressings. If you\u2019re wary of including this form of sweetener and all its calories in your diabetes diet, simply choose products that list sugar, not high-fructose corn syrup, as an ingredient. Keep in mind though that both sugar and high-fructose corn syrup add calories to food, and try to develop a taste for foods that are less sweet to better manage your type 2 diabetes.\nRelated story: Docs Urge Feds To Assess 'Toxic' Sugar\nProcessed Meats\nAlthough they don\u2019t usually contain sugar, processed meats, which are heavy on salt and preservatives, seem to be linked to an increased risk of diabetes. Instead of relying on lunch meats, deli meats, and various kinds of sausages, go for meat that is closer to its natural state. Try using leftovers from a roasted chicken for a lunchbox sandwich, for example. Also, build in more meatless options for type 2 diabetes control.\nRelated story: Red Meat Can Be Unhealthy, Study Suggests\nFast-Food Hamburgers\nThis fast-food staple may be a diabetes risk factor for you. Research shows that African-American women who eat hamburgers in a restaurant two or more times a week are much more likely to receive a diabetes diagnosis than those who do not. A small, plain hamburger probably isn\u2019t the root of this problem \u2014 it\u2019s more likely that the oversized patties, buns, and toppings are contributing to these statistics. If you\u2019re eating out, opt for a small, grilled-chicken sandwich with lots of veggies instead. Dr. Hannon recommends researching restaurant menus in advance to plan healthy choices.\nRelated story: Jillian Michaels' 5 Junk Food Rules\nSugary Cereals\nBreakfast cereals in brightly colored boxes are a staple in many households. If you\u2019re guessing that added sugar is part of the problem these processed foods pose for people with diabetes, you\u2019re right. The other part is that they lack dietary fiber \u2014 and a high-fiber diet has been shown to help prevent and manage diabetes. Look for cereals that provide about 5 grams (or more) of fiber per serving and don\u2019t contain large amounts of sugar.\n"}, {"score": 880.55286, "uuid": "a4f1004d-05ba-5313-a049-ef166d228869", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1715wb-45-01128", "target_hostname": "www.weightwatchers.com.au", "target_uri": "https://www.weightwatchers.com.au/util/art/index_art.aspx?tabnum=3&art_id=45101&sc=3030", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "Better <em>than</em> a restaurant", "snippet": "<em>Bake</em> in a hot oven for 10 or 15 minutes.

In this season when the weather here in Ohio can sometimes make going to the store quite a chore, I like to make sure my pantry is full of reliable ingredients for winter comfort foods and quick meals. The pantry is also great source of inspiration for creating winter dishes: I open the door, stand there like a teenager in front of an open refrigerator, and ponder what would taste good.\u00a0 I can nearly always come up with something pretty delicious.\nIn additional to basic items, there are a few pantry items I keep especially for this season, when I like deep, savory, smoky flavors and hearty foods.\u00a0\u00a0 Here\u2019s short list of winter staples from my pantry to yours, in hopes of passing that inspiration along.\nThe Basics\n1. More Than Gourmet\u2019s Stocks (of course!): Winter is the season of soups, stews ,\u00a0and braises , so stock is number one on my supply list.\u00a0 Stock is also useful for making pan sauces after saut\u00e9ing or roasting, and as cooking liquid to boost the flavor of rice and whole grains , \u00a0among other things.\u00a0 I usually always have several MTG stocks on hand, ready for cooking with meat, poultry, seafood, grains, or vegetables.\n2. Dried pasta: Long, skinny, short, fat, round, flat: the varieties of and uses for pasta are nearly endless.\u00a0 Simmer some small pasta in chicken stock, add saut\u00e9ed onion, a few handfuls of fresh (or frozen) spinach, and some grated Parmesan, and you have a great soup.\u00a0 You can also stir in a can of white beans (drained and rinsed) for a heartier version.\u00a0 Toss some cooked linguine with a couple cloves of garlic minced and cooked briefly in a generous measure of olive oil; add a drained can of good tomatoes and season with plenty of salt and pepper and you have a flavorful pasta dish.\n3. Beans and legumes: Canned or dried, they make a great addition to soups, salads, pastas and more . \u00a0Pur\u00e9e beans to make savory spreads for dipping or for sandwiches or pizza.\u00a0 Good beans are a necessity for my favorite chili , and the centerpiece of one of my favorite soups: creamy white bean soup with pancetta . \u00a0Canned beans should always be drained and rinsed.\u00a0 Dried beans are a little more trouble, since they need to be soaked and then cooked, but they offer more flavor potential because you can give them a deeper savory taste by cooking them in stock and adding things like dried herbs, garlic, or onion while they\u2019re cooking.\n4. Whole grains: These are an indispensable pantry item, whether for a simple side dish, the base of a main dish, or an addition to a salad or soup.\u00a0 More and more varieties are now available in stores: a rainbow of different rices , quinoa, barley , bulgur wheat ,\u00a0spelt, and on and on.\u00a0 Frequently I\u2019ll cook a batch of a whole grain in chicken or veggie stock, along with a bay leaf and some sea salt, and keep it in the refrigerator.\u00a0 Then I can reheat a small plate of it and top it with leftover roasted or saut\u00e9ed veggies and some cheese for lunch, or I can ladle hot soup or stew over a mound of it in a wide bowl for dinner, or I can add some toasted nuts, dried fruit, sliced green onions, orange juice and olive oil to make a hearty whole grain salad.\n5. Tomatoes: Forget about the \u201cfresh\u201d ones in the produce department.\u00a0 In winter, I want good quality canned tomatoes to use in salsas, pastas, soups, stews, and sauces. Perhaps the most perfect canned tomato is the Italian San Marzano variety; it is renowned for its firm, meaty texture and deep, tangy tomato flavor.\u00a0 San Marzano tomatoes can be found now at many grocery stores.\n6. Parmesan cheese: Although it lives in the refrigerator and not the actual pantry, I always have Parmesan on hand.\u00a0 It adds life and savory flavor to nearly anything on the dinner plate, from pasta to grains, potatoes, vegetables, soups, and sauces.\u00a0 For the best Parmesan flavor, you need a chunk of the real stuff from Italy, not grated until you do the grating.\u00a0 Keep it loosely wrapped in your refrigerator.\nA Few Extras:\nHoney: The complex sweetness of honey adds an extra dimension to marinades, salad dressings, glazes for fish, chicken, or vegetables, and even to my spicy black bean chili .\nDried fruits: Toss them in salads, hot and cold cereals, or yogurt, or add them to savory sauces for meats or poultry.\u00a0 Add a handful of raisins to braised winter greens or try stirring some snipped dried apricots or prunes into your next pork, beef, or lamb braise or stew\u00a0for a terrific sweet/savory flavor.\nFlavorful oils: In this season I like to use walnut or toasted sesame or roasted garlic oil in place of my usual olive oil or butter.\u00a0 They add deep, toasty flavor notes and are perfect in vinaigrettes, drizzled over a baked sweet potato or steamed broccoli, or for finishing a sauce or a soup . These types of oils can be a bit pricey, but they go a long way.\nChipotles: Is an ingredient pass\u00e9 when a national restaurant chain is named after it?\u00a0 Probably.\u00a0 I still love chipotles, anyway.\u00a0 These smoked jalapenos, usually sold canned in adobo sauce, give a wonderful, warming, smoky heat to soups, stews, chilies, sauces ,and salad dressings.\n"}, {"score": 873.3543, "uuid": "998daea8-d984-576c-ba9e-29795491ddea", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0306wb-62-05022", "target_hostname": "archive.supermarketguru.com", "target_uri": "http://archive.supermarketguru.com/page.cfm/170", "page_rank": 1.1755757e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Jazz <em>it</em> Up: Add Something Different <em>to</em> Dinner Tonight", "snippet": "<em>Bake</em> in or out of the peel, cube and add <em>to</em> stews, boil or <em>fry</em>.

Here are some ideas to jazz up your dinnertime routine without straying too far from the mainstream or your neighborhood grocery store. Add anyone of these suggestions to your dinnertime menu and gain a healthy dose of nutrients, along with a newfound knowledge of some of the many varieties of food just waiting for you to try.\nKumquats- These Chinese treasures look like small olive shaped oranges but you eat them with the skin on. They are versatile enough to serve sliced in a fruit salad or cooked with meat, poultry or fish. Kumquats contain Vitamin C, beta-carotene and folate.\nKasha - Mix with your favorite pasta or use as a side dish, these earthy tasting kernels are made from buckwheat and supply fiber, complex carbohydrates and B vitamins.\nWonton Wrappers - You'll find these handy wrappers in a refrigerated case generally in the produce section of your supermarket. Use them to hold anything you consider edible from meat to vegetables, then steam or fry and serve with your favorite sauce. Made from wheat, they are a good source of complex carbohydrates and B vitamins.\nSquid - Frequently found in Asian and Mediterranean dishes, squid can be sliced into finger stacking ring shapes and broiled or fried to suit your taste buds. A good source of protein, iron, and B-vitamins, these creatures make for lively conversation.\nPlantains - These hearty members of the banana family should always be cooked but can be eaten during any of the three ripening stages: green, yellow or black. Bake in or out of the peel, cube and add to stews, boil or fry. Plaintains supply potassium and complex carbohydrates.\nLychee - A tiny beauty, this Chinese fruit has a pink to red shell outside and is white inside with a texture like grapes. Remove the seeds then use the fruit as a topping for frozen yogurt or low fat ice cream. The lychee supplies both vitamin C and potassium.\nSource: The American Dietary Association\nColumn Archives\n"}, {"score": 872.8026, "uuid": "8eab05f1-f558-5498-b85c-1966eb8fcf8e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1404wb-90-20870", "target_hostname": "www.sustainabletable.org", "target_uri": "http://www.sustainabletable.org/2010/04/the-great-bake-sale-debate/", "page_rank": 1.181411e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Sustainable Table \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb The Great <em>Bake</em> Sale Debate", "snippet": "I\u2019m no scientist, but I\u2019ve come <em>to</em> the conclusion that <em>is</em> <em>it</em> <em>is</em> junk <em>food</em> \u2013 mass produced, over-consumed, nutrient-poor crap \u2013 that has caused this epidemic.", "explanation": null, "document": "The Great Bake Sale Debate\nApril 2nd, 2010 Posted by No Comments\nAs reported in a previous post , the New York City Department of Education (DOE) recently passed a regulation banning home baked goods from being sold in schools for fund raising purposes with the exception of one PTA run bake sale per month. Instead, parents and students are allowed to choose from 27 approved snack items which they can buy\nthrough Costco or the DOE \u2013 the same items which are regularly sold in school vending machines. These items include Doritos, Pop Tarts and Linden\u2019s cookies.\nThe regulation has caused quite a stir among New York parents. On March 18th, there was a \u201cBake-In\u201d rally held at City Hall by NYC Green Schools calling for an appeal of the regulation. Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and Council Member Gail Brewer were in attendance along with parents and children fighting for the bake sale cause. This regulation has also sparked a bit of debate here at our office with varying opinions on whether the regulation is achieving its goal in reducing calories or merely encouraging students to indulge in junk food.\nSo, in the spirit of The New York Times \u201c Room for Debate \u201d column, we present you with several varying opinions on New York City\u2019s bake-sale ban.\nHome-Baked, Healthy Kids\nBy Sophy Bishop\nNew York\u2019s children, along with the rest of the nation\u2019s, are overweight \u2013 it\u2019s a\nwell known fact. I\u2019m no scientist, but I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that is it is junk food \u2013 mass produced, over-consumed, nutrient-poor crap \u2013 that has caused this epidemic. The issue is compounded by lack of exercise and minimal time spent at the table and with family, but at the heart of this problem, it is what children consume that is to blame.\nUnfortunately, many children and their parents are never taught the elements of a proper diet. When the \u201cauthority\u201d that is the DOE says Doritos are ok but home baked goods are not, it only enforces the scheme that junk food is what they should be eating. Seeing those labels day after day, they become commonplace, training minds and taste buds alike to prefer HFCS and artificial flavors. These preferences get carried beyond the school and out into a lifetime. They form a favor for fast meals, greasy meat byproducts and fried food and a distaste for fresh, green vegetables.\nHome-baked goods trump junk food any day, whether they contain more or less calories than a pack of Pop Tarts. They surpass junk food because of what they represent \u2013 care, time, seasonality and home-cooking. There is no shiny advertising, no unpronounceable chemical and no major corporation influencing life-long decisions. Home-baked goods foster community, culture, a love for cooking and eventually, a healthier America.\nTime For Real Food\nBy Dawn Brighid\nWith a fundamentally broken school food system (and food systems in general), I can see why banning the school bake sale feels like a little control over a bad situation. Childhood obesity is at an all time high, with no end in sight. Limiting a child\u2019s food intake will solve the problem, right? Not so convinced and a bit confused by the bake sale ban, I asked some questions at the \u201cbake in\u201d rally at city hall.\nThe most problematic information I came away with was that often the \u201chomemade\u201d goods for sale weren\u2019t actually homemade. The cakes and cookies are often bought cheaply from stores like Costco and Target. They are then marked up and sold back to the kids. Why? One parent told me the funds were often used to support after school activities \u2013 just the kind that help prevent obesity. But with no funds, no after school exercise. What a \u201cCatch 22.\u201d\nWe need more funds for schools. We need real food in the schools. We need education about food for kids and parents. Do I think that a bake sale ban will resolve the obesity problem? No. It seems like a quick fix to me. I think putting our time, energy and money into national programs like \u201c Time for Lunch \u201d is a better way to get to the core issues we need to fight the childhood obesity issues for the long run.\nAcceptable (Marginally)\nBy Chris Hunt\nAs a longtime proponent of freedom, homemade cookies and public policies that don\u2019t unduly pad the coffers of the industro-snack sector, I found it tough to stomach the bake sale ban.\u00a0 But as an advocate of efficient implementation of policies that effectively protect public health, I begrudgingly support the rule.\u00a0 Mostly.\nHere\u2019s the deal: 43% of NYC schoolchildren are overweight or obese \u2013 this is a public health crisis that needs to be addressed immediately. \u00a0Obviously, there\u2019s no quick-fix solution to the childhood obesity epidemic; the problem is related to food access, consumption patterns, physical activity, environmental factors, etc.\u00a0 Nonetheless, an effective policy response must involve promoting healthful food choices and discouraging consumption of excess calories.\u00a0 It\u2019s difficult to argue that brownies and cupcakes and cookies and rice crispy treats are optimal food choices \u2013 or that such foods, when habitually consumed immoderately, constitute anything but excess calories.\nIdeally, we\u2019d teach kids to make better food choices, and they\u2019d do so despite the abundance and accessibility of junk food at bake sales and elsewhere.\u00a0 The government has attempted to implement this very strategy for decades \u2013 and failed miserably .\u00a0 If we make the reasonable assumption that the DOE can\u2019t dramatically alter students\u2019 food-purchasing preferences overnight, then a prudent policy approach would involve reducing the amount of unhealthful food available in schools \u2013 which would require the city to either limit the frequency of bake sales, or ensure that only healthful foods are sold.\nUnfortunately, bake sales are an important source of revenue, so schools are unwilling to cut back drastically, or reduce profits by restricting sales to fruits and vegetables.\u00a0 (Strangely, the fact that schools lack sufficient funding to operate without supplemental bake-sale dollars has been largely ignored throughout the debate.)\nThe city\u2019s solution: limit the frequency of no-treat-left-behind bake sales, and ban aggressively unhealthful foods from all the other bake sales.\u00a0 The obvious problem: homemade foods are prohibited from the latter events \u2013 even if they\u2019re more healthful than anything on the city\u2019s list of approved junkLite foods.\u00a0 And of course, it\u2019s lamentable that the policy tacitly endorses prepackaged, processed snacks and drums up extra business for the makers of Doritos, Poptarts, et al.\nNevertheless, the current ban has merit from a public health perspective; sure, it\u2019d be great if kids ate carrots \u2013 but given the obesity crisis, it\u2019s better they eat somewhat-healthful snacks than exceptionally unhealthful snacks \u2013 homemade or otherwise.\u00a0 Ideally though, the city would either exclude everything but fruit and veggies from the \u201chealthy\u201d bake sales, or else develop criteria for inclusion of healthful homemade foods.\u00a0 Or give schools adequate funding so that bake sales wouldn\u2019t be a financial imperative in the first place.\nTags: bake sale\u00a0bill de blasio\u00a0fast food\u00a0junk food\u00a0new york city\nSearch\n"}, {"score": 872.09, "uuid": "3b3fc909-0080-5216-becb-e5c4a172e044", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1900wb-51-09135", "target_hostname": "www.yummydietfood.com", "target_uri": "http://www.yummydietfood.com/2008/06/did-you-say-low-calorie-healthy-french.html", "page_rank": 1.1787131e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Yummy, Low Calorie Diet <em>Food</em> -- Plus Where <em>to</em> Buy!", "snippet": "Still not too bad if you can stick <em>to</em> the serving amount!

These foods are becoming more available in our grocery stores, specialty food shops, restaurants and take out locations.\nWe enjoy the tasty foods from these various cuisines but are they nutritious? While some traditional foods may be healthy, the choices we make when making ingredient substitution make some recipes higher in fat, sugar or sodium than they were meant to be. Also, we may also be eating larger portions of these tasty foods, especially when we eat out. This can mean more calories than we really need.

I kept looking for them, but I had no luck finding them so I gave up. In order to compensate, I began to eat Trader Joe's Chocolate Wedges instead. I love the Chocolate Wedges, but I missed the yummy thin dark chocolates from Whole Foods.\nThen, after months of not being able to find my chocolates, I came across a sample station at Whole Foods last weekend that consisted of a plate full of individually wrapped dark chocolates. They were wrapped in red wrap (instead of shiny purple wrap like before) so I didn't recognize them at first. But, once I opened one up, I was delighted to find my precious flat dark chocolate inside. The chocolate hadn't changed at all, but the wrapping and packaging was totally different! I'm so happy to have my chocolates back!\nThese \"little dark chocolates\" are officially \"Belgian Chocolate Little Bites (Petites Bouchees)\", made by Whole Foods.

Radishes can be eaten raw, braised, roasted, saut\u00e9ed or stir fried.\nClean, crisp, mild and refreshing, cucumber is usually served raw. However, once the seeds are removed, it\u2019s also good cooked.\nIt's a\u00a0great addition to stir-fries or roasts, in particular when saut\u00e9ed with mint to accompany roast lamb. For a more comforting dish, pair cucumber with bacon or ham and onion\u00a0to make a great soup that can be served hot or cold.\nTo enjoy the warmer weather, why not blend your cucumbers and serve as a dip with juicy homemade lamb burgers? Cucumber can also be surprisingly good in desserts too - try adding it\u00a0to a sorbet of lime and mint.\nWith a mildly sweet, almost nutty flavour, crisp and fresh flavored cauliflower is a versatile seasonal favourite.\nExcellent when lightly steamed, roasted or stir-fried, its receptiveness to spicier flavours like cumin, turmeric, chilli and ginger renders it invaluable in many Indian dishes.\nFor a delicious thick and creamy soup, puree cooked cauliflower with vegetable stock and milk and stir in handfuls of your favourite blue cheese.\nTender spinach leaves add freshness to summer cooking.\nThe best way to cook your spinach is to use quick cooking methods to retain maximum freshness and flavour. For a fuller flavour try adding a few toasted pine nuts and a sprinkling of raisins at the last minute to curries, risottos and creamy pasta dishes. Versatile and tasty, spinach combines well with other ingredients such as cream, cheese and eggs.\nSpring greens are a truly fantastic vegetable that can be used in a wide array of dishes.\nSweet and crunchy without the hard core found in the centre of other cabbages, the young bright green leaves are ideal for steaming, stir-frying or adding to soups and vegetable bakes.\nSpring greens are perfect as an accompaniment -\u00a0and easy to prepare. Just toss the cooked leaves in some black pepper and butter and serve with a steaming hearty stew.\nSpring greens are also fantastic when cooked with onions and garlic then finished with cream or tossed with buttery fried bacon or pancetta\nThese delicious and nutritious leaves add a peppery edge to green salads and are brimming with vitamins and minerals.\nNot many people know this but adding a handful of watercress to any salad or stir-fry gives the whole flavour of the dish a lift. Alternatively, blitz your watercress into a soup, or stir through pasta for some added bite.\nThe delicate and slender shockingly pink stems of rhubarb are a welcome sight at the start of the year, bringing a sharp yet refreshingly clean tasting flavour to cleanse and invigorate.\nThe perfect accompaniments to sweet recipes, roast whole rhubarb with honey and serve with ice cream or alongside a delicious sticky ginger cake.

There are some shortcuts I like \u2013 using salad dressing instead of oil to pan fry things in \u2013 that I picked up from KF&F, but some like using Cream of Blah soup, I wish I had never heard of.

Which is why I hope adopting more Asian styles in my life will help. More carbs than a low carb diet, but less food overall.\nAnyways. I think I may watch my DVRed copy of Good Eats\u2019 casserole show and revamp this. It tasted pretty good, but was mostly a way to use up some of the frozen leftover ham, and take advantage of a sale on yummy spring asparagus. It doesn\u2019t make much economic sense to use $0.99/lb leftover ham, $1.47/lb asparagus, and then a $2 box of stuffing and a $2 can of soup . . . And I would definitely pack it a little tighter. This recipe made it so loose that it was kinda spoonable, with no structural integrity at all. But here\u2019s the original recipe:\n1 pkg. (6 oz.) STOVE TOP Stuffing Mix for Chicken\n3 cups cubed cooked ham\n18 fresh asparagus spears (about 1/2 lb.), cut into 2-inch pieces\n1 can (10-3/4 oz.) condensed cream of celery soup\n1/2 cup milk\n1 cup KRAFT Shredded Swiss Cheese\nPREHEAT oven to 350\u00b0F. Add 1-1/2 cups hot water to stuffing mix in medium bowl; stir just until moistened. Let stand 5 min.\nMIX ham, asparagus, soup and milk in 13\u00d79-inch baking dish; sprinkle with cheese. Top with stuffing.\nBAKE 30 min. or until heated through and golden brown on top.\nIt was nice having a minimum of dishes to do last night, though. I served this with a green salad and Mac and Cheese \u2013 yes, the nuclear orange kind, I\u2019m trying, damn it! I bought two boxes after not buying any for months! And if DD had her way, she would eat it morning, noon, and night. And this is the only kind I actually like the taste of.

Instead of stopping anywhere to eat who knows what, why don't you pack your own lunch?

Salads from fast food chains can have the same and sometimes more calories than the burgers they serve. Take a moment to see what it is you are actually consuming. Some of the fast food chains have taken notice of people that have chosen to eat healthier, and reduced the amount of calories and fat in their products. Yet, we should not only be worried about those two things. It's what goes into your food that matters. Our bodies have evolved over millions of years to digest and use what is naturally available to us. But science has leaped far ahead of this process and introduced processed foods and man-made additives to our diets. Our bodies do not know how to deal with this, and end up storing it away, turning into fat. We also tend to ingest our highest calorie amounts at dinner time. Unfortunately all those calories have no where to go, we burn very little tossing and turning in bed, and wake up with our hips slightly plumper. Breakfast should be your biggest meal of the day, followed by a medium sized lunch and small dinner.\nWe need to move away from the fast food and vending machine lunches. There is a whole world out there with healthy, delicious, and easy to prepare recipes for the sack lunch, for both the adult and child. If you are a parent, you have an idea of what your child is willing to eat. Introducing new foods can be a struggle. My children will fight over who gets the blue foods. Find out your child's favorite color and add it to the lunch menu by making your own sandwich bread, pita or pasta. Add the food coloring to the wet ingredients, and two drops will usually be enough. Also adding food coloring to a bottle of water and freezing it the night before is a great way to get your children to drink more water. Fruit juice is good for you, but not in excess. The best lunch time drink is water.\nMaking a vegetable not look like a vegetable is a hard trick. Thinly sliced vegetables hidden under the cheese for a pizza are the easiest. But you can also use thinly sliced or chopped vegetables in pita. Chop up your child's favorite lunch meat and mix them all together with a reduced fat cream cheese.\u00a0Allow your child to help with the preparation. It builds pride and they will be more likely to eat the sack lunch. Replace white breads, with wheat breads or pita. There are some store bought varieties that are festive, adding fruits to the mix. Giving your child choices is also a way to get them to eat the packed lunch. Just be aware of the child's age and give only a few things to choose from. You don't want to ask a five-year-old what do they want for lunch, and leave it completely up to them. Instead ask if they would prefer to eat worms or frog eyes. This will get an eeewww gross, and a giggle, then they will be happy to help cook. Kids that help prepare their own meals improve their reading skills, math skills, and creativity. Talk to them about what is good for you; and why it is good.\nChildren will also eat many things cold that we as adults would never imagine. Fish sticks, chicken nuggets, pastas, and kabob are some favorites. And remember to make your own lunch at the same time. Eating the same thing as your child will teach them good eating habits. It's all right for you to show up at work with a bunny-shaped sandwich. Use cookie cutters to create a more appealing sandwich for your child. Here's a hint for salads, keep the crunchy items separate from the juicy items and dressing. Allow them to mix them before eating. This will insure that the lettuce carrots and radishes will not get soggy.\nNo children? That's fine.\u00a0 Many of these recipes are wonderful for work. You might also try cooking lunches on the weekend, freezing a week worth in individual lunch sizes, and heating them up in a microwave during the week. Don't forget some of these creative ideas to include fruit in your meals.\nRemember that your packed lunch should include all the food groups. It should be a medium sized meal so that you have enough calories to help you through your day. And don't push aside your sweet tooth. A bit of chocolate or other favored treat is great, as long as you don't over indulge.\nSalads\nMakes 4 to 6 servings\n1 pound carrots (5 to 6) peeled and shredded\n\u00bd cup raisins\n1 carton (8 oz) low fat vanilla yogurt\n4 to 6 iceberg lettuce leaves\nMix carrots, raisins and yogurt together.
