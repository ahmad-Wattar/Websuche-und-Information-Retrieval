To accommodate our return from the Masai Mara, please schedule your departing flight after 6 p.m.\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nTrip Rating\nBoundless Journeys\u2019 trips are designed for energetic and flexible individuals who like to be active and have a spirit of adventure and a positive attitude. The Best of East Africa is rated 1, easy, on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being the most strenuous). We combine camping and lodges as the base for our primary activity \u2013 game-viewing drives by 4WD vehicle. Depending on current conditions, there may be opportunities for optional guided bush walks, which can be enjoyed by anyone who is in reasonably good health.\nCamp Life\nThe camps and lodges we have chosen are among the finest available in East Africa. While camp life is relaxed, the service is 5-star: exceptional cuisine, superb locations, and an authentic safari atmosphere are the norm. We have also chosen camps and lodges that offer a level of exclusivity that is not always found on safari. We search out the best properties, generally on private reserves or in remote locations, which allow us to avoid the more crowded areas of the national parks.\nGame Drives\nUnforgettable full and half-day game drives are the primary activity of Boundless Journeys\u2019 Tanzania &\u00a0Kenya safari. On most days, we will depart our lodge or camp early and spend the morning, tracking various animals in our custom-built, 4WD safari vehicles. Each day is unique and unpredictable \u2013 which is why our guides say never put away your camera, even on the way to the airport!\nDrives may last from a few morning hours to a full day. Sometimes we will take a picnic lunch, and other days we will return to the lodge or camp for lunch. As we come upon groups of animals, we allow plenty of time to simply observe and take photographs. Our guides are experienced naturalists and will add greatly to your understanding of the animals. We keep a respectful distance \u2013 although the same cannot always be said about the animals; it is not unusual to come nose-to-car with baboons, zebras, wildebeest, gazelles, and elephants.\nWeather\nThe weather in East Africa is generally pleasant though the equatorial sun is strong. It can also rain at any time, but chances are higher during the months of April, May, June, November, and December. In the Ngorongoro area, evenings and early mornings can be chilly, and dressing in layers is a good strategy, so that you can shed or add layers as the day heats and cools. In general, days are warm to hot from December-March (average high in the low 80s, but some days will be hotter), and a bit cooler from July-October (average highs in the low 70s).\nYou may obtain more detailed weather information at www.weatherbase.com.\nWhen to Go\nOur safaris coincide with important times in the annual migrations, as well as take advantage of other significant animal activities and weather patterns.\nDecember: Being on safari with your family is a memorable way to spend the holidays, and a great reason to consider a December departure. During this time, the migration is heading south to the short grass plains. Many zebras give birth, and you may see predators trailing behind the herds. Plan ahead, however, as airfare can sell out well in advance!\nJanuary-March: The herds have typically arrived in the southern short grass plains of the Serengeti by now, and tens of thousands of wildebeest have their babies over the course of just a few weeks. A safari at this time of year will certainly offer sightings of enormous herds of wildebeest, along with all of the other African wildlife one would expect. The Masai Mara is green and peaceful at this time of year, with few other travelers about.\nJune-October: The large herds are on their way north and will generally arrive in the Masai Mara in late July or August. If you are lucky, you may witness herds crossing one of the large northern rivers \u2013 truly a sight to behold.\nOther times: We suggest avoiding November and April through the first half of May, as those months comprise the rainy seasons in Tanzania. Outside of those months, there are great reasons to visit East Africa at any time, and no matter when you choose to go, you will see more elephants, giraffes, wildebeest, zebras, gazelles, buffalos, hippos, ostriches, baboons, and lions than you can keep track of.\nTanzania Accommodations\nOverview: Upscale deluxe permanent camps and boutique lodges in private settings; all private baths.\nNight 1: Mountain Village\nArusha, Tanzania\nNestled at the foot of the wooded slopes of Mount Meru, this unique hotel stands amid coffee plantations on the shores of tranquil Lake Duluti. Designed to echo the traditional style of the colonial coffee farm which originally stood on this site, Mountain Village offers a range of tastefully presented cottage-style rooms set amid extensive landscaped grounds.\nNights 2 &\u00a03: Gibb's Farm\nKaratu, Tanzania\nSet among extensive gardens, this award-winning property is comprised of the Farmhouse and 20 cottages, all at the heart of a working farm nestled on the edge of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area near the village of Karatu. Built in 1929, the Farmhouse has evolved into a comfortable retreat, while retaining the charm of a well looked-after private house. Cozy living rooms and reading corners are just steps away from the dining room, bar and gift shop.\nNights 4, 5 &\u00a06: Kusini Camp\nSerengeti National Park, Tanzania\nPerfectly sited in a cluster of kopjes, Kusini is a permanent luxury tented camp blended seamlessly into the delicate environment of the predator-rich plains of the Serengeti. The surrounding short grass plains provide the setting for the most spectacular natural phenomenon on the continent, the wildebeest migration, during which time the herds amass in the vicinity of the camp for the birthing of their young. Kusini sits exclusively in this remote region of the Serengeti, affording guests the rare opportunity for secluded game drives well away from the usual tourist circuit.\nNights 7 &\u00a08:\u00a0Tortilis Camp\nAmboseli National Park, Kenya\nSituated in one of Amboseli's areas of Acacia Tortilis woodland, this luxury permantent camp features spacious tents with elegant en suite bathrooms. There is a main lounge, bar and dining area, all exquisitely built with natural materials and thatched roofs, with magnificent views of the snowcapped Mount Kilimanjaro.\nNights 9, 10, &\u00a011: Olonana Camp\nMasai Mara, Kenya\nPart of the renowned Sanctuary group, Olonana is an award-winning tented camp set on a private stretch of the Mara River, at the foot of an impressive escarpment where the famous last scene from Out of Africa was filmed. Located just a few minutes drive from the famed Masai Mara Game Reserve, this camp offers the ideal blend of seclusion and prime location.\nDay 12 (day-use only): Ole-Sereni Hotel\nNairobi, Kenya\nConveniently located a short drive from the airport and on the edge of Nairobi National Park, day-use rooms are provided for resting and repacking before your international flight, if you have not reserved our Zanzibar: The Spice Island trip extension.\nTanzania & Kenya Suggested Itinerary\nPlease note that this is a suggested itinerary, and can be customized to suit your interests. Actual activities may vary to take advantage of weather conditions, wildlife behavior, and to allow serendipity to play a hand in your experience. Accommodations are as outlined in the itinerary, although we reserve the right to change these should the need arise.\nDAY 1\nArrival to Arusha\nUpon arrival of your flight to Kilimanjaro International Airport, you are met by a Boundless Journeys representative who will transfer you to our lodge, set quietly aside Lake Duluti on the grounds of a former coffee plantation on the outskirts of Arusha.\nUpon arrival to the lodge, you are greeted by the friendly staff, offering refreshments before turning in to rest after your travels.\nMountain Village, Arusha. No meals.\nDAY 2\nLake Manyara\nHalf day game drive\nAfter a pre-safari briefing, we drive through Arusha, entering the Great Rift Valley, where the Earth\u2019s plates are separating. This geologic phenomenon allows for the formation of the volcanoes in the region \u2013 one reason the Serengeti supports such a unique ecosystem. On the far side of the valley we reach Lake Manyara National Park.\nEven though Lake Manyara is one of Tanzania\u2019s smaller national parks, its jungle-like forest and immense \u201csoda lake\u201d support a great variety of wildlife. As we slowly make our way along a dirt track through the park, we may encounter pools of water full of hippos and see countless pink flamingoes, dainty gazelles, and graceful giraffes meandering through tall grass. We enjoy lunch at a viewpoint overlooking the lake, spying on animals through binoculars and scanning the trees for elusive tree-climbing lions.\nUpon leaving the park, we drive to Karatu and our home for the evening, a former farm that is now a luxurious lodge in a peaceful Rift Valley setting, with a long-time reputation for excellent dining.\nGibb's Farm, Karatu. All meals included.\nDAY 3\nNgorongoro Crater\nFull day game drive\nThis morning we drive to the rim of the Ngorongoro Crater, and then descend into the 100-square-mile caldera that is home to a huge concentration of wildlife\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 including the \u201cbig five\u201d \u2013\u00a0 elephant, buffalo, leopard, lion, and rhinoceros.\nOne of seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites designated in Tanzania, Ngorongoro is the world\u2019s largest unflooded caldera. While only 100 square miles in area, the crater is home to six distinct habitats: acacia forest, swamp, short grass plains, long grass plains, rivers, and woodland. Each habitat attracts a variety of animals. The rim of the crater reaches 7,800 feet in altitude and the crater floor rests at 5,000 feet. Home to almost 30,000 animals in an area naturally enclosed by the slopes of the volcano, this is the best location for viewing black rhinoceros and huge, old bull elephants. There is not enough vegetation to support the large cow and calf herds, but the old males \u201cretire\u201d to the crater for the wonderful swamp grass and acacia forest. The only animals we will not see in the crater are the impala and giraffe. It is not known why impala do not inhabit the crater, but giraffe are unable to descend the steep grade without lowering their heads, which raises their blood pressure to dangerous levels.\nMaking our way slowly across the caldera floor, which contains sweeping grasslands, lerai forest, a soda lake, and marshy wetlands, people often have the sense of being in another time. The landscape is so primitive, the ecosystems so intact, that it is like taking a trip to prehistory. Coming upon a lone elephant, a beautiful giant with gracefully curving tusks quietly munching on the soft grasses, listening to him breathe, is something one won\u2019t soon forget.\nTonight when we are back at the lodge, sitting comfortably by a crackling fire, our thoughts will be on the crater and the unseen drama unfolding in the darkness, on the hunters and the hunted, completing life\u2019s circle, as they have been for thousands of years.\nGibb's Farm, Karatu, Tanzania. All meals included.\nDAYS 4-6\nThe Serengeti\nTwice daily activities\nThis morning we drive to the nearby Manyara airstrip, where our scheduled flight meets us to bring us to the southern Serengeti. Upon arrival, you'll be met by your guide and immediately begin your exploration of one of the planet's most iconic national parks. Short grass plains define the southern Serengeti, and from December-March the Great Migration of wildebeest fills the plains. Babies are born over just a few short weeks in February and March, as the herds take advantage of the nutrient rich grasses, and predators take advantage of an ample supply of prey. For three days, when not out exploring in open vehicles with your naturalist guide, you can enjoy our luxury permanent camp, located in a peaceful area away from the more frequented areas of the park. It is a treat to shake off the dust after a day of game viewing, and enjoy a cool drink on the beautiful kopjes overlooking the Serengeti. Staff rangers escort us through the grounds in the evening, in the event that some of the local animals may have come in close for a look.\nSanctuary Kusini Camp (three nights), Southern Serengeti, Tanzania. All meals included.\nDAYS 7-8\nAmboseli National Park\nTwice daily activities\nSet near the Tanzania/Kenya border, the scenic Amboseli National Park is dominated by views of majestic Mount Kilimanjaro. Impressive numbers of elephant and giraffe populate the reserve, and make beautiful photographic subjects before the spectacular mountain backdrop. Also found in the park are large herds of buffalo, all the typical plains game, and rarer species such as gerenuk, lesser kudu, and fringe-eared oryx.\nOur luxury camp is situated just outside the park gate in the 30,000 acre private Kitirua concession. Its location in a private reserve allows a variety of activities in addition to game drives, from cultural visits to guided nature walks and visits to the Cynthia Moss Elephant Research Center (some activities at additional expense).\nTortilis Camp (two nights), Amboseli National Park, Kenya. All meals included.\nDAYS 9-11\nMasai Mara\nTwice daily activities\nThis morning we drive to the nearby Amboseli airstrip, where our scheduled flight arrives to bring us to the Masai Mara (via Wilson Airport in Nairobi). Upon arrival in the Mara, you'll be met by your guide and immediately embark on your first game drive. From the months of June-October, the Great Wildebeest Migration is often in the Mara, and particularly in July and August huge herds can often be seen crossing the crocodile-filled Mara River \u2013 one of Africa's most dramatic spectacles. Even when the herds are not present, there is rich plains game and impressive predators in the area, including many lions and cheetah.\nOur camp for the next three nights is nestled on the banks of the Mara River in a private concession just a few minutes drive outside the park gate. Tribal villages dot the landscape, the sounds of Maasai cow bells float on the breeze, and hippos call from their pools in the river. It is truly an idyllic setting.\nSanctuary Olonana Camp (three nights), private concession bordering Masai Mara Game Reserve, Kenya. All meals included.\nDAY 12\nDeparture from Nairobi\nAfter breakfast on our final morning, we drive to a nearby airstrip, where we say good-bye to our naturalist guide and board our flight to Nairobi's Wilson Airport. From Wilson, you can connect to Zanzibar (if you have reserved Boundless Journeys\u2019 Zanzibar: The Spice Island trip extension). Alternatively, you will be met by a Boundless Journeys driver who will transfer you to a 5-star hotel on the outskirts of town, just minutes from the International Airport, where you will have a day-use room to rest and prepare for your evening international flight. A transfer to the airport in time for your flight will also be provided.\nOle Sereni Hotel (day-use), Nairobi, Kenya. Breakfast included.\nSuggested Trip Length\nWhen to Go\nUpcoming Trips:\nThis Private Collection Safari can be scheduled on the dates that work for you, subject to accommodation availability. We suggest December-March (migration in the Serengeti; February and March are highlights); or June-October (migration in the Masai Mara; July and August are highlights).\n2012 Land Cost\n"}, {"score": 2222.557, "uuid": "07a221e0-396f-5fd8-a17c-ce3ff7ae6dd4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0603wb-61-03908", "target_hostname": "www.safari.go2africa.com", "target_uri": "http://www.safari.go2africa.com/tours/safari-beach-holidays.asp", "page_rank": 1.3000119e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Safari</em> Beach Holidays - <em>Safari</em> Holidays to <em>Kenya</em>, <em>Tanzania</em> &amp; Zanzibar", "snippet": "These <em>Safari</em> Beach Holidays capture the highlights of <em>Tanzania</em> <em>or</em> <em>Kenya</em> before ending at <em>a</em> beach retreat, either on the beach in <em>Kenya</em> <em>or</em> on the tropical island of Zanzibar.

Here on Africa\u2019s Great Plains, where the sky arcs like a blue bowl over shimmering gold grasslands, the number of animals is staggering. Buffalo, elephant and giraffe roam the savannah. Leopards rest in acacia trees, pursuing prey with lion, cheetah, jackal and hyena.

In the shadow of Mount Meru, where verdant forest intersects with grassy savannah, Arusha sits within a lush agricultural region famed for its coffee and tea. Originally a German settlement, Arusha is today a lively city with an international flair. Arusha is noted for handcrafts, and the Cultural Heritage Center boasts an array of superb carvings, paintings, batiks and baskets.\nview image gallery\nDays 2-4: Tarangire Nat'l Park\nSeldom-visited Tarangire, the \u201cBaobab Capital of the World,\u201d boasts Tanzania\u2019s largest concentration of wildlife outside the Serengeti, including 550 bird species that frequent its seasonal swamps. The Tarangire River is the lifeblood for wildebeest, zebra, buffalo and huge herds of elephant that scratch its bed for underground streams during the dry season. Impala, gazelle and eland crowd the lagoons, while wild dog roam the red-dust plains. Tarangire is also home to two rare antelope, the fringe-eared oryx and gerenuk.\nview image gallery\nDays 5-6: Ngorongoro Crater\nWithin the walls of the world\u2019s largest unbroken volcanic caldera is the densest concentration of wildlife in all of Africa.

Wildebeest, zebra, eland and giraffe are abundant, with leopard and cheetah in pursuit. The exceptionally fortunate may also spot the endangered black rhino.\nview image gallery\nDay 7: Nairobi\nA rough outpost amidst a highland swamp when it became the colonial capital of British East Africa in 1907, Nairobi today is the urban heartbeat of an independent Kenya and one of Africa\u2019s most important cities. Nairobi has long been a meeting point for adventurers and travelers from all over the world, and most Kenya safaris still originate here. Nairobi\u2019s excellent museum and the historic home of Karen Blixen, author of Out of Africa, are popular attractions.\nview image gallery\nDays 8-9: Amboseli/Chuylu Hills\nElephants abound in Amboseli, and to see these African icons against the backdrop of snow-topped Mount Kilimanjaro is a timeless image of the continent. This mosaic of dusty plains and swampy springs is also home to buffalo, wildebeest, zebra, impala, hyena, lion, leopard, cheetah and a third of Kenya\u2019s nearly 1,100 bird species. The nearby Chyulu Hills are exceptionally photogenic.

Entebbe, a former British colonial administrative centernow home to Uganda\u2019s president, is a city of 80,000 on Lake Victoria. The National Botanical Gardens, laid out in 1898, are a must-see. Uganda\u2019s capital, Kampala, was established during the 13th century Buganda kingdom, one of the oldest in Africa.

Vast herds of antelopes, zebra and prides of lions share their home with hundreds of birds species including the famous pink wash of flamingos across Lake Manyara to Ngorongoro Crater and then to Serengeti plains full of herbivores and predators.\nFocus: Wildlife and Natural History.\nOn this tour we concentrate on northern Tanzania, an area of superlatives and variety. We explore beautiful soda and freshwater lakes, the great grasslands of the Serengeti, and the spectacular Ngorongoro Crater. Covering such a range of habitats and altitude zones, we will encounter a great variety of mammals, and also birds, for conveniently the national parks harbour the best of African birdlife, from the giant Ostrich to tiny finches and colourful weavers.\nWe begin our holiday in Arusha National Park, a microcosm of Tanzanian scenery. Spectacularly set between the huge volcanic peaks of snow-capped Kilimanjaro and rugged Mount Meru, the park is a verdant wilderness where monkey-filled rainforest encompasses the undisturbed Ngurdoto Crater and the beautiful Momella, Lakes that hold Hippos, waterbirds, and the reflection of Mount Kilimanjaro African Buffalo, Olive Baboon, Bushbuck, Warthog, Giraffe and Eastern Black-and-white Colobus Monkey may be seen; whilst, amongst an abundant birdlife, we will look out for African Pochard and Maccoa Ducks on the lakes, and White-eared and Brown-breasted Barbets in the woodland.\nWe drive next to Tarangire National Park, where thousands of animals from the southern Masailands must come regularly in search of water from the Tarangire River. In the park\u0092s rolling bushland and savanna, punctuated with spectacular Baobab Trees, African Buffaloes, Eland, Oryx, Gerenuk, Impala, Elephants and Lesser Kudu may be found, together with such bird species as Crested Francolin, Yellow-collared Lovebird, Brown and Orange-bellied Parrots, Northern Pied Babbler and Magpie Shrike. Next we visit the legendary Ngorongoro Crater. Permanently watered, the crater\u0092s 225 square kilometres support a year-round residential population of thousands of mammals. Amongst great herds of Blue Wildebeest, African Buffalo and Burchell\u0092s Zebra, we will see Lions, Black-backed Jackals and Spotted Hyenas. Most notably, the crater is perhaps the best place in all of Africa to see the endangered Black Rhinoceros.\nBirdwatching is excellent at Ngorongoro; the lakes and rivers attracting abundant wetland species, and the grasslands holding Ostriches, bustards, Secretary Birds, eagles and vultures.\nOn the crater rim the lush montane forest holds an entirely different range of species which we may encounter around our lodge and on early morning and evening walks. Here we will also meet the people of the Masai tribe, proud, elegant and well attuned to their environment... and the commercial potential of incoming tourism!\nThe Serengeti National Park\u0092s 14,673 square kilometres of acacia-dotted plains hold nearly two million Wildebeest and two thousand Lions; its selection of other mammals and birds is mouth-watering. We have five full days to sample the wealth of this great African wilderness.\nLeaving the Serengeti we will stop at the Olduvai Gorge \u0097\u0093Cradle of Mankind \u0094\u0097 the famous archaeological site where Dr. Leakey discovered the 2-million-year-old remains of the Nutcracker Man, alongside those of prehistoric elephants and giant ostriches. Even today it is an area teeming with game.\nLake Manyara is our last port of call. Its hotel and pool, beautifully perched on the wall of the Great Rift Valley, overlook the forest, plains, and flamingo-lined lake of the national park where we will search for its particularly large Elephants, tree-climbing Lions, and abundant birdlife.\nClient Comments:\n\"A superb tour which fully lived up to expectations. I saw 470 bird species and mammal sightings included 16 cheetahs, 10 Black Rhino, Lions galore and 1m+ Wildebeests. Timing of the tour was perfect, coinciding with incredible numbers of animals in the Southern Serengeti. The guides were really excellent.\" D.Mike.\n\"This holiday was more than I expected and thoroughly enjoyed. I would recommend it to anyone who was visiting Africa for the first time and who wanted to meet such friendly people.\" J.Yankees.\n\"Peter was a brilliant guide - and I have very high expectations! The driver guides are a real credit - they were excellent! Nothing was too much trouble. The whole trip was a wonderful experience! Thank you for enabling me to have the opportunity of sharing in it!\" Susie Miks.\n\"This is the 3rd successive trip we have taken with Mbango Safaris and each has been excellent in its own way. The holiday fulfilled our wish-list for birds so we were very happy with our choice. We really had an exceptional holiday and enjoyed wonderful scenery and bird life - I am sure we will be using Mbango Safaris again in the near future!\" Dibbie.\n\"Peter, as a guide was brilliant, as well as being very good company.\" Cornwall.\n\"We had some truly amazing sightings and views of most wildlife and the whole experience was far beyond my expectations.\" S.R., Cambridgeshire.\n\"We believe Peter Kamau is one of the best natural history tour guides we have met. His knowledge of wildlife was extensive and he helped everyone to spot as many different species as possible...We greatly enjoyed seeing such a wide variety of mammals and birds in Tanzania and we intend in due course to travel again with Mbango Safaris.\" J and J G., Devon.\n\"Having Peter as tour guide was an asset, his knowledge of birds and wildlife made the holiday so enjoyable. He ensured that the entire group saw whatever had been spotted. His sense of humour made it all the better. We saw so many beautiful sightings. I had tears in my eyes seeing and hearing a mother Cheetah calling her young baby? eventually she went to find her baby and brought it to the kill. Magical. The driver guides were marvellous drivers and guides. We nick-named Peter Eagle-eyes, always with an eye open to tell us of a bird or animal that we could easily have missed as they are well camouflaged. My friend and I both say it was one of our best holidays for birds and animals. The group that we were with seemed to get on well together. It was a really memorable holiday: I would love to go again. I am sure that my friend and travelling companion S.J. sends her thanks and best wishes too.\" B.G., Wales\nGrading: This tour is a tented camps and lodge based Tanzania Wildlife safari. Please remember that, in the game parks of east Africa, it is generally not permitted for visitors to leave the safety of their vehicles, apart from in our lodge grounds, meaning that we\u0092ll spend quite a lot of time in the safari vehicles! It is, though, the only way to see Tanzania\u0092s unrivalled wildlife and every participant will enjoy a window seat.\nWeather: During our tour we can expect most days to be dry and fairly sunny, temperatures ranging from 20- 30oC, depending on altitude. Overcast weather, particularly in the afternoons, may not be infrequent, but rain is unlikely except on high ground such as Ngorongoro, where afternoon precipitation is a possibility. Here the weather can be chilly between sunset and sunrise.\nEntry requirements: All European countries passport holders and most other nationalities require a visa for Tanzania which is obtained in advance from the nearest embassy or on arrival at the airport. You will also need to have various vaccinations and take malaria prophylactic.

As for the safari, our driver/guide Amile, was excellent. As expected, he knew all the animals and where to find most, but he also knew all of the birds we saw as well which was a bonus for me. He also took the initiative and re-arranged the day's itinery to give us the best safari experience.\nChris Burbridge\nEngland\nWe did indeed have a fantastic time. Fantastic driver/guide. Nothing bad to state, he was a pleasure to be traveling with; full of knowledge and humour. He had plenty of time for us and was exceedingly helpful. Lodges were good, nice service, people. Standards of hotels were fine. The bad point about the safari was that most of the animals had migrated towards Lake Victoria and we didn't see as many as we'd have liked in Serengeti - never the less we did see the big 5 (just not as many as we'd have liked) and we had a nice time. The hot air balloon was wonderful. The captain was humorous and we loved every moment of it. Thank you so much for assisting and organising this trip, we had the time of our life.\nGurjeet Bedi\nEngland\nJust arrived back in the UK. Just to let you know everything went off without a hitch and we had a ball!!!! Made it to the top of Kilimanjaro and had an awesome safari. So just a note to thank you for all the organisation and thanks in particular for putting up with our changing requests. Many thanks to you and all your team.\nRod Wilson and Emma Broadfield\nEngland\nThe whole trip went very smooth and we'd really like to praise the driver (Vincent Mumba). He was explaining everything very well and made great suggestions about fine-tuning and further improving our trip. He always found the right balance between \"leaving us alone\" and engaging.\nAyla and Grischa Sauerberg\nOverall we have had a very nice safari in Tanzania. We enjoyed the full 5 days at the Ngorogoro crater/ Serenget and 6 days at the Kempinski Hotel at Zanzibar. We have seen the big 5, a lot of other animals and had a very good and kind guide.

Nairobi, known as the \"Green City in the Sun\", has in recent years undergone rapid growth and is today not only Kenya\u2019s largest city but the most populated city in East Africa.\nWe recommend that you arrange to arrive a day or more before the safari begins, giving you time to rest and explore the relatively small city centre of Nairobi. Practice your bargaining skills at Nairobi\u2019s fascinating market, browse its bookshops and craft stores, or sit back and relax at one of the numerous cafes and restaurants in the city.\nMeet the friendly people of Kenya, the most popular travel destination in East Africa, keeping an ear out for the Swahili \u201cJambo\u201d which means hello. Kenya has long had a well-established tourism industry and you\u2019ll often hear the words \u2018Hakuna matata\u2019, meaning no problem.\nOn day one of our camping safari we leave Nairobi early in the morning and head for the Masai Mara National Reserve. We cross the Great Rift Valley on our way to the Masai Mara, famous for its large populations of big cats, stunning scenery and the Great Migration.\nWe spend the next two nights camping on the outskirts of the world-renowned Masai Mara Reserve, home to Africa\u2019s Big Five - elephant, lion, rhino, buffalo and leopard. Our days are filled with morning and afternoon game viewing drives in search of the abundant wildlife found in this 1510 sq km game park.\nThe Masai Mara looks like the idyllic Africa seen in movies, consisting of wide-open plains dotted with Acacia trees and thickets of vegetation; as well as fertile riverine woodland along the meandering Mara and Talek rivers. Everywhere we go in the Mara we will see numerous wild animals including Masai giraffe, wildebeest, baboons, warthogs, bat eared foxes, grey jackals, spotted hyena, topis, impala and hartebeests.\nThe Masai Mara Reserve is known for its\u2019 annual Wildebeest Migration, when thousands of wildebeest, zebra and other herbivores stampede across the plains in search of fresh grazing. They migrate north from Tanzania\u2019s Serengeti in about July and return south crossing the Mara River in about November. This dramatic migration is one of the most impressive wildlife spectacles in the world, especially seeing the grazers plunge into the Mara River inhabited by crocodiles and hippos. An impressive number of predators and scavengers, such as lion cheetah and hyena, follow the herbivore migration adding to this truly spectacular sight.\nThe Masai Mara is home to huge numbers of elephants, buffaloes, zebras and hippos, making for superb bird watching and game viewing all-year round. Lions are also commonly sighted as they lounge around after a heavy meal, or search the plains for their next prey. Cheetah and leopard are fairly common in Mara, although these more elusive cats are harder to spot.\nAfter exploring the scenic Masai Mara we cross the Great Rift Valley once again returning to Nairobi for an overnight stay.\nDAY 4 - 8: Arusha to Serengeti National Park, Olduvai Gorge & Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania\nNext we travel south to the busy border frontier of Namanga where we cross into Tanzania. We drive to Arusha, Tanzania\u2019s main safari hub located at the foot of lofty Mt Meru.\nThere is time to explore the bustling city of Arusha, the halfway point between Cape Town and Cairo. Experience the colourful curio markets, shops, and lively coming and going of people.\nLeaving the town of Arusha we make our way west to our next overnight camp situated on the plains outside Arusha. Take a walk in this open area, or embark on a camel ride to a local Masai village and visit the nearby Meserani Snake Park.\nFrom our camp near Arusha we travel by 4x4 safari vehicles to Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater, where we will spend the next three days.\nAlong the way we visit Olduvai Gorge, known as The Cradle of Mankind, a famous archeological site. A number of significant hominid fossils, including some of the earliest known ancestral remains of humans, were first discovered by anthropologists Louis and Mary Leakey.\nFrom Olduvai we descend onto the game-rich open plains of the vast Serengeti, famous for its\u2019 enormous Great Migration. Also known as the Wildebeest Migration this annual wildlife spectacle occurs when 1.5 million wildebeest, 200,000 zebras and 350,000 gazelles stampede across the endless Serengeti plains in search of water and fresh grazing.\nVisiting the Serengeti plains, lush in the wet season and more arid in the dry, is an unforgettable wildlife experience at any time of year. Serengeti National Park is arguably the most famous game reserves in the world, offering some of the best game viewing in the world.\nTanzania\u2019s oldest national park, the Serengeti National Park covers 15,000 square kilometers and is a world heritage site. The Serengeti is home to a remarkable diversity of wildlife and birds, including great herds of wildebeest, zebra and gazelle, as well as lion and other predators. The Masai name for Serengeti is Siringitu, which means \"the place where the land moves on forever\", aptly describing the endless flat plains.\nAfter the unforgettable experience of camping under the stars in an unfenced campsite within the Serengeti, where lion and hyena roam freely, we set off for the Ngorongoro Crater\nThe Ngorongoro Crater, known as Africa\u2019s Garden of Eden, is the largest unbroken caldera in the world at around 326 sq km\u2019s. We reach the top of the crater\u2019s outer rim, at around 2400m above sea level, where we camp for the night. The views over the 600m deep and 16km wide crater are breathtaking. This World Heritage Site hosts almost all of the animal species found in East Africa, including rhino, lion, cheetah, elephant, hyena, zebra, wildebeest, warthog, buffalo, various antelope species and numerous birds.\nIn the morning we make the steep descent onto the Crater floor and spend the morning game viewing in this unique wildlife haven. We have lunch in the Ngorongoro Crater before driving up the steep crater wall, stopping at the crater rim to admire the breathtaking views one last time.\nFrom the wildlife-rich Ngorongoro Crater we return to our camp outside Arusha for an overnight stay.\nDAY 9 \u2013 13: Dar es Salaam & Zanzibar, Tanzania\nAfter stocking up on supplies in Arusha we continue our journey through Tanzania to Dar es Salaam, our next stop.\nOn our drive to Dar es Salaam we get to see Africa\u2019s highest peak, Mount Kilimanjaro, at around 5895m high.\nDar es Salaam, Tanzania\u2019s largest city is located on the East coast of Africa and as serves as the main port in Tanzania. There is usually some time to explore this bustling African city, browsing the curio markets and sightseeing. We prepare for our trip to Zanzibar Island and spend the night at a campsite on the beach just outside Dar es Salaam.\nIn the morning we take a ferry to the Zanzibar Archipelago, a cluster of lush tropical islands lying about 40 km\u2019s off the coast of Tanzania in the Indian Ocean. The main island is Unguja, also called Zanzibar Island, and the second main island is Pemba.\nThe Zanzibar Islands are an alluring tourist destination, offering white sand beaches, exotic spices and a rich cultural heritage. Visitors are drawn to Zanzibar for its\u2019 idyllic beaches and interesting history that can be seen in the architecture of places like Stone Town, as well as its\u2019 diverse cultures.\nWe spend the next few nights on Zanzibar, allowing for plenty of time to explore this rustic and exotic island paradise. This tour does not follow an itinerary on Zanzibar Island, so you are free to choose your own activities and enjoy the islands at leisure.\nExplore the palm-fringed beaches up north, choosing from the array of activities available. Activities include snorkelling and scuba diving in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, taking excursions to the smaller off-lying islands and sampling the delicious fresh seafood on offer. Or you could simply relax on one of the beautiful beaches; sipping on a cocktail and taking a refreshing swim in the sea. Go on a romantic sunset cruise in a traditional Dhow sailing boat or hike one of the trails on the lush forested island of Zanzibar.\nBrowse the bustling local markets and visit the intriguing mosques, palaces and courtyards of Stone Town, or stroll through the winding lanes of the historic quarter stopping at Arabic-style shops. Treat your senses to a Spice day tour to one of the spice plantations in the area where spices including cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and pepper are grown - a feast of tastes, scents and colours.\nZanzibar features a unique blend of Arabic and African cultures having once been a major centre for the trading of slaves and spices. Even today the population of Zanzibar is mostly Sunni Muslim with the strong Arabic influence being evident in Zanzibar\u2019s culture as well as its\u2019 architecture and town design. Some of the 19th century\u2019s great European explorers, such as Richard Burton and David Livingstone, used Zanzibar as a base, with the islands gaining independence from Britain in 1963.\nAfter our exotic Zanzibar Island adventure we take the ferry back to Dar es Salaam on the mainland, bringing the unforgettable Kenya, Tanzania & Zanzibar Camping Safari to a close.\nPlease Note:\nYour Zanzibar accommodation for the three night island trip is included in the Basic Local Payment of the tour.\u00a0Your tour leader will book accommodation in Stone Town (one night) and at the beach (two nights) but you are free to explore the island and relax at your own pace.

Mbango Safaris offers a special opportunity to experience the variety and contrasts of Kenya, going well beyond the regular tourist circuit. There will be only three departures, each for a group of eight to 12 people, escorted by our knowledgeable guides to Kenya game parks and a beach stay is also included.\nAll our guides have travelled extensively to all parts of the country, and the tour reflects their keen personal interest in the human side of Kenya, as well as the natural environment and wildlife. Along the way, the guides will offer short presentations about Kenya and its recent history.\nPerfect for those wanting to get below the surface, the tour provides a one-off chance to meet and interact with a wide range of Kenyans going about their daily lives, as well as to understand more about the issues facing developing countries. The schedule is busy and includes some rough roads and long drives, but complemented by the chance to relax in some of Kenya\u0092s renowned beauty spots.\nTour highlights.\nThe tour will take in a full spectrum of activities \u0096 at one end, for example, a tea estate and a flower farm, at the other, community projects. A full day is spent with a remote Masai community, offering the chance to see their animal husbandry, their homes, a dispensary and a local school. An immensely proud people, the Masai prefer to retain their traditional lifestyle and remain one of the last great nomadic traditions in Africa. A visit is made to a local primary school where children are encouraged and supported.\nFauna and Flora.\nNo visit to Kenya would be complete without the opportunity to enjoy the wildlife. The tour will cross Tsavo National Park as well as the Masai Mara, one of the world\u0092s most enthralling wildlife theatres. It will also include Lake Nakuru National Park, with its populations of rhino and lions and an alkaline lake which attracts concentrations of flamingos and pelicans and the freshwater Lake Naivasha.\nThe Great safari includes the chance to enjoy some of Kenya\u0092s flora, with a day in the Kakamega Forest, the last remnant of tropical rainforest that once stretched to Kenya from the Congo. There are also visits to Arabuko Sokoke Forest to see a reforestation project, working with the local communities to preserve the forest ecosystem, and to a community project to help protect the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest on the coast.\nWith all these sites under pressure from population growth and human activity, the tour will focus on the threats to the environment and what can be done to save Kenya\u0092s unique natural heritage.\nAccommodation.\nAccommodation is in a complete variety of hotels, camps and lodges, according to availability of rooms close to the projects visited. As the tour is \u0091off the beaten track\u0092, accommodation will not always be the typical tourist fare. And few tourists venture to the tranquil Rondo Retreat in the Kakamega Forest. Better known is the tented camp in the Masai Mara, with comfortable tents tucked around a large watering hole that teems with animal and bird life. The tour ends with three nights at the 5* Turtle Bay Hotel on the coast at Watamu, an unrivalled Kenyan setting with an ambience of relaxed sophistication, coupled with the facilities and standards of an international resort. Whilst here, there is an opportunity to visit Watamu Turtle Watch, as well as a local fishing community.\nPeter, Mbango Safaris Senior Safari specialist, comments, \u0093We are recognizing that many travellers now want more out of a holiday than the standard tour and would like to learn more about Kenya, including projects and other initiatives to improve the livelihoods of Kenyans, something which has always been important to us.\nThe tour is so varied that everyone will find their own highlights, but I anticipate that the visits to schools and local projects will have a special appeal for all.\nThe Great Safari has three departures in the year 2009: February 2009, June 2009 and October 2009.

Established back in 1959, Kimbla-Mantana know East Africa inside out and provide an unrivalled experience for our guests that is sadly missing in many quarters today. Many people wrongly assume that all safari holidays in Kenya are the same, nothing could be further from the truth. In order to get the most out of any adventure it is essential that you select the right people to make your trip a memorable one. Although there is a selection of cheaper rivals online you generally get what you pay for and it is always worth spending a little more rather than a little less. If you have any questions about any aspect of our Kenya safari tours and cannot see the information detailed on our website please don\u0092t hesitate to contact us and one of our experienced team will be happy to provide you with the requested information or even some recommendations if required. We not only pride ourselves on the ultimate experience we facilitate but also the level of customer service we provide, one call to us will amply illustrate why we are generally regarded as amongst the best in the world of real life adventures.\nThe Dark Continent\nAfrica, sometimes referred to as \u0091The Dark Continent\u0092 has thousands of different cultures and along with that a cornucopia of different languages, customs and superstitions and although you couldn\u0092t hope to experience them all, we hope to introduce you to a few when you embark on a luxury safari in Kenya. Depending on which location you select for your animal adventure you can expect to come into contact with one, or perhaps, more communities of indigenous people. Although we cover many countries in East Africa, we generally specialise in Kenya wildlife safaris and with more than 40 ethnic groups you are sure to gain a fascinating insight into the day to day lives of a differing array of people. The culture of this very special country is also enhanced by the steady influx of immigrants who have been arriving here for centuries and have added their own unique cultural mix to the melting pot. Of course the main reason why people from all over the world choose Kenyan safari tours over the more conventional holiday options is to see the animals. Documentary makers have been coming to Kenya for years and displaying the footage captured on their photographic extravaganzas for all to see on TVs in a plethora of countries. Although animal adventures are very popular due to the general accessibility of the animals, none of this would be possible without the input and guidance of the local people and at Kimbla-Mantana we realise this only too well.\nAdventure and Intrigue\nAlthough often marketed as a Kenya safari holiday, an African excursion is much more than a vacation, more of a once in a lifetime experience. If you have never been to East Africa before, the first thing you will notice is the seemingly endless landscape. From rolling green plains to savannahs, to snow topped mountain peaks, this particular part of Africa really is blessed by Mother Nature. Perhaps the most celebrated region for a Kenya wildlife safari are those in and around the Masai Mara. Stretching northwards from the Serengeti plains, this vast tract of land is the ideal place to spot the \u0091big five\u0092 and also if you are very lucky the endangered Black Rhinoceros. This area is also renowned for the local tribesmen whose lives\u0092 today remain largely untainted by the relentless march of technology and continue with traditions which have been handed down through the generations. If you\u0092d like to experience a wealth of wildlife in combination with a fascinating culture, Kenya safaris could be just what you have been looking for, please contact us for further details. However, the Masai Mara has to some extent been a victim of its own popularity, unregulated tourism to this area has also made its mark on both the landscape and the people. Kimbla \u0096Mantana are very aware of their responsibility to the environment and the people who inhabit it as well, leading only low impact tour groups we are committed to leaving the environment exactly as we found it.\nLuxury Kenya safaris\nA common question we receive from our prospective adventure excursion guests is about the standard of accommodation provided on Kenyan safaris, there are a number of options available. The most popular option for the vast majority of guests embarking on a savannah experience are the authentic lodges. A typical lodge in this region will be constructed using local materials and more often than not blend seamlessly with the local environment and have unrestricted views of the landscape which makes for great viewing of animals in their natural environment. For those guests who like a swim, after a long day in the bush, some of the lodges come equipped with a swimming pool, what could be more relaxing? If you are under the impression that a Kenya safari company only deals with walking over arid bush land in the blazing heat for hours every day, please think again. Kimbla-Mantana are well placed to provide the best that a 4x4 adventure can possibly offer, capable of tackling a multitude of terrains this awesome mode of safari travel enables the intrepid animal spotter to reach places that would normally be inaccessible by any other mode of transport. If you have any special requirements in regard to itineraries, modes of transport or accommodation please don\u0092t hesitate to contact us, simply provide a brief outline of what you want to do during your Kenya safari holidays and we will endeavour to design a tailor-made programme based on your exacting requirements.\nUganda Safaris\nIf you are considering an exhilarating adventure and have already experienced the delights of Kenya, why not consider moving slightly further afield and see what Uganda and Tanzania can offer? Kimbla-Mantana have extensive experience in these countries and can enable you to see some of the exclusive wildlife that inhabit these regions. One experience which is exclusive to Uganda is the world famous Uganda gorilla safari.

Generally, economic activities in our host communities are tree felling for wood fuel and charcoal burning, and\u00a0 brewing of illicit drinks which sometimes turn to be deadly on consumption.\nA number of people practise small scale fishing. Many youth are wasted due to poor economic capacity build up and turn to drug abuse to escape misery and stress of hopelessness.\nABIMBO VILLAGE\nSocial Amenities:\n-Accessibiliy to the village is poor due to lack of good road network and surrounding public schools are under-developed and under-staffed.\n-There are no village based health facilities eg clinics,dispensaries and people rely on government centralised health centers several miles away:- This increases infant mortality rate, poor community health and prevention from mother to child transmission of HIV/Aids (PMTCT) at birth becomes a problem as many child deliveries happen at home (village) under unqualified mid-wives.\n-Many girl children are subjected to early marriage due to poverty conditions. While generally youths are infected and affected by HIV/aids scourge making them inactive towards community development process, thus, affecting the gross domestic production, hence poor living condition.\nMAJOR PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES AT THE GRASS ROOT LEVEL:\n1: Volunteer in Education:\nThis program focuses on the Kenya primary schools attended by orphans and the most vulnerable children in the villages of Western Kenya. It is an initiative by Volunteer students abroad on a trip to Kenya and the Kenya volunteer students and social workers, that through their volunteer program help to improve the learning conditions of the Kenya community based Primary public Schools,mostly attended by poor children who hardly have anything to eat at home,or get very little meal that cannot sustain their stay in school for a whole day!\n2: Volunteer in Community Healthcare:\nHealth care is a fundamental aspect in Kenya, especially when we consider our village based programs and outreaches. Of the global ill health reports, 24% of the cases are registered in Africa with access to very few health workers, averagely 3% to attend to the ill health problems. Most communities in Africa still depend on either witch doctors or traditional herbalists, the latter who are not trained, cunning and don\u2019t have specific prescriptions for their medicines.\n3: Volunteer in economic Empowerment:\nWe empower the community stakeholders economically through self-sustainable initiatives for income generating activities. The empowerment workshops are organized at the community resource center where tailoring and dress making classes are conducted on voluntary basis.\n4: Volunteer on Environmental care:\n-Through planting trees, we hope to improve water catchment areas and revive our lost glory on climate. We therefore encourage the establishment of tree nurseries to distribute seedlings for planting.\n-We lead the society in establishing proper disposal units through provision of dumping facilities e.g for garbage, etc\n- We are in the forefront on campaigns that encourage clean water provision, this is done through establishing water storage facilities which include plastic water tanks, brick, built under ground water tanks and ceramic treatments ( filters).\n5: Volunteer in Community Support initiative:\n-This helps Provide space and opportunity for community workshops, forums and seminars.\n-Provides volunteers with resources, equipment and personals for the community needs.\n-Lead the community on better standards of education by establishing a quality learning institution for early childhood development, education.\n-Provides a source of local and international volunteers\u2019 with knowledge and skills to develop and uplift the standards of living within the host community.\nCustom Safari Enquiry\nHotline: +254 725 881 811\nKenya Volunteer Programs\n"}, {"score": 1940.0929, "uuid": "2eefd4fb-7f9d-5659-8f4c-4fcd00ee5ac9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400wb-23-32172", "target_hostname": "www.newadventures.com", "target_uri": "http://www.newadventures.com/vacation/botswana/the-safari-experience-botswana/site/site/thankyou/site/site/thankyou/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "African <em>Safari</em> Experience - <em>Kenya</em> - <em>Tanzania</em> - Botswana - South Africa", "snippet": "<em>A</em> <em>safari</em> in Africa <em>is</em> filled with excitement and adventure.
