If you're a little confused about the differences between these two knives, you're not alone.\nCeramic knives tend to live a mysterious life so to speak and are very particular in what they can do, how they should be handled and how they should be stored. And these two types of knives should never, ever nest together.\nNote that these use and care tips are provided as a general guide only and you should always consult the product manual for brand-specific manufacturer's recommendations for any knife you buy.\nA Look at Steel Knives:\nSteel knives come in various sizes, styles and steel quality. You can find very cheap steel knives, some of which have better qualities than others, with various degrees of durability. The type of steel used in regular kitchen knives will influence how long the blades will hold their edge, as well as corrosion resistance and so on.\nA high quality kitchen knife will be full tang , have a comfortable handle , be well-balanced and sport a forged high-carbon steel blade for better edge retention.\nGood quality steel knives need proper handling and care in order to be free of rust, pitting and to maintain a sharp edge. That means using them for what they were intended for, washing by hand, drying and storing them safely to avoid injury and damage to the knives. Over time, a steel knife will usually show its age from general use. Quality steel knives can be honed with a knife steel or sharpened to restore the fine edge. Note that some high-end knife manufacturers do recommend their knives be returned for professional sharpening.\nDifferent styles of steel knives affect function when it comes to boning, slicing or dicing. For instance, you would use a more flexible boning knife to debone chicken or filet fish. And a Santoku knife is ideal for chopping, dicing and slicing onions, vegetables and numerous other cutting tasks. A chef's knife is best for carving, slicing and so on. There's quite an assortment of blade lengths , styles and knife features when it comes to steel knives. There's also a diversity of knife handles .\nWhy Ceramic Knives Are a Different Breed of Knife\nCeramic knives on the other hand, are not as diverse as sizes and styles go and are generally limited to a few practical lengths. Quality ceramic knives are made of materials that are stronger than diamonds, usually zirconium oxide. Most ceramic blades are white, though there is a growing number of grey and black ceramic knives. The hardness of the ceramic gives these knives their long-lasting good looks, as well as a razor sharp edge that does not require sharpening for years. That is why many chefs love using ceramic knives. This sharpness makes slicing easier, allows precise cuts and extremely thin slices.\nThe ceramic blade is stronger than steel but unfortunately, is more fragile because it is more brittle. That means that if you drop a ceramic knife or attempt to cut bone or frozen foods with one, it can break or chip. Unlike steel knives which can be used for various slicing/dicing/chopping tasks, ceramic knives are limited in use mainly to slicing fruits, vegetables and boneless meats. According to some manufactures, you can slice cheese with a ceramic knife, but not all agree. And while some brands have limitations when it comes to certain vegetables and fruits, others do not list such notables. Manufacturers are looking for ways to make their ceramic knives more versatile and durable.\nOther things that should be avoided is twisting, scraping or bending the ceramic blade and subjecting it to extreme temperatures. As for the knife handles, a well-designed ceramic knife will have a comfortable handle that completes the well-balanced feel, as well as provide a safe, sure grip. When it comes to handling, ceramic knives are extremely lightweight and that may appeal to many because it reduces hand fatigue and requires less effort for certain slicing tasks. Don't let the lightweight nature fool you; you can get the same great control as you would with a more weighty steel knife. It all depends of course on the quality and design of the knife.\nUnlike a steel knife, a ceramic blade will not rust, pit or leave a metallic taste on foods. Blades will retain their sharp edge for a long time and must be sharpened either by the manufacturer or with a brand-specific specially designed ceramic knife sharpener. Because they are very sharp and brittle, ceramic knives must be stored in a custom sleeve or box. They should never be stored in a drawer with other (steel) knives. Though some manufacturers say their ceramic knives can be washed in a dishwasher, most recommend hand washing and I agree.\nWill Ceramic Knives Replace Steel Knives?\nNo, ceramic knives will never fully replace your traditional steel kitchen knives. That's mainly because they are limited when it comes to use. There's also less variety of styles and lengths of ceramic knives so you would still need steel knives for various cutting tasks. They are meant to be used for slicing only, but this may change in the future with industry advancements. As such, ceramic knives would nicely expand your selection of knives. That said, a ceramic knife might become your go-to knife for slicing tomatoes or vegetables, simply because of handling and performance preferences.\nConsumers should take care not to judge a ceramic by the same principles they do a steel knife. They are not cut from the same cloth and that would be like comparing apples to peaches. As for price, ceramic knives may seem more expensive, but a high quality steel knife can also set you back a few bucks. And remember that ceramic knives require less sharpening. When it comes to storing, ceramic knives require a protective sheath or proper storage container, something that is also recommended for sharp quality steel knives.\nThe extra care needed for ceramic knives will probably deter some consumers, especially those who prefer carefree kitchen knives. The avid professional and home chef though, will find ceramic knives worth the care and they will probably have an assortment of ceramic to complement their cutlery essentials.\nRead reviews of the paring knives shown in the illustration:\n"}, {"score": 1852.148, "uuid": "4a374fd3-a4d2-5fae-aeec-e171b8386145", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0006wb-79-22015", "target_hostname": "housewares.about.com", "target_uri": "http://housewares.about.com/od/knifereviews/fr/Zx-Kitchen-Ceramic-Knives-Review.htm", "page_rank": 1.1960529e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "ZX Kitchen <em>Ceramic</em> <em>Knives</em> Review", "snippet": "<em>Ceramic</em> <em>knives</em> are very different than <em>steel</em> <em>knives</em> in handling as well as function and they <em>should</em> be used only for slicing fruits, vegetables and boneless meats.", "explanation": null, "document": "Learn more from the manufacturer ; read ceramic knife care information\nHow the ZX Kitchen Ceramic Knives Performed\nZX Kitchen Black Ceramic Knives\nPhoto \u00a9 ZX Kitchen\nJanuary 6, 2012\nAt first glance, the workmanship of these knives is quite evident and they are anything but typical ceramic. The knives are really beautiful to look at, lightweight and very comfortable with soft-feel nonslip handles. The ceramic blades are black, so you don't need to worry about discoloration and that also makes them stand out from the average ceramic knife.\nThis Precision Set (boxed) includes very practical kitchen knives: A 3-1/2\" paring knife and 5\" utility knife. The knife handles are warm and the soft feel and shape of these knives make it very easy to control when cutting or slicing. If you're new to ceramic, the lighter weight is very noticeable compared to steel knives and one might think it would be difficult to control such a knife, but not so. A well-designed ceramic knife with a comfortable handle is easy to control. The ZX knives also have a safety feature, the shape of the handle keeps your fingers away from the blade and the point of the blade is blunt.\nWe found the ZX Ceramic 5\" Utility Knife most useful for slicing ham and boneless meats and cutting vegetables for salads. It slices through tomatoes with incredible ease and we were able to get extremely thin slices with no effort. These knives are well balanced and allow precise cutting. Although the point of the knife is blunt, you can gently slice a tomato with ease. The small Paring Knife peels an apple as easily as using a peeler and coring apple quarters requires little effort.\nThe best of care was given to these ZX Ceramic Knives and that is crucial with any ceramic brand. They were not used near bone or with frozen foods, nor were they dropped. Knives were always used with either a wooden or plastic cutting board. And we used the ZX knives for fruits, vegetables, processed or boneless meats. They were also handwashed and dried - something I recommend with any sharp knife, and immediately returned to their storage box.\nI point out this special care for two reasons. First because ceramic knives need ultimate care and that includes proper storage. By nature, ceramic knives are stronger than steel, but are more brittle and can break. Secondly because even with this kind of care, the utility knife sustained a small chip about 1.25\" from the point end, during this test.\nNot noticed immediately, we assumed it might have happened when we sliced through hard raw potatoes, turnips or carrots. These were the hardest foods and during slicing you could hear the blade against the cutting board. There could also have been a little grit on the unpeeled potatoes and maybe this caused the ceramic to chip. Whatever the cause, it remains a mystery. This was most unfortunate and very disappointing.\nOverall Impression\nCeramic knives are very different than steel knives in handling as well as function and they should be used only for slicing fruits, vegetables and boneless meats. They also require much more care than steel knives in terms of use or storage and you cannot sharpen a ceramic knife, unless the sharpener is specifically designed for use with this type of knife. Ceramic knives would never replace your regular steel kitchen knives , but rather enhance your knife selection, providing options for the slicing or cutting task at hand.\nThe ZX Kitchen\u2122 Ceramic Knives tested offer the consumer very comfortable, lightweight and razor-sharp knives for slicing fruits, vegetables and boneless meats at comparable prices. I like the feel, look, material construction, design and sharpness of these knives. The drop in rating is mainly due to the possible durability issue.\nHere's my dilemma in rating this review. Was it user error, an (isolated) defect in this particular knife or a lack of knowledge, that caused the Utility Knife to chip during testing. By lack of knowledge, I mean these knives are supposed to be able to slice vegetables, but is that limited to soft vegetables only? If this were the case, it would reduce usage somewhat. In all fairness to this brand and without knowing the exact cause of the chip, I gave this review a moderate rating. These knives cannot be sharpened with typical knife sharpening tools; they must be sharpened by the manufacturer.\nConfirmation of usage will be requested from the manufacturer and comments posted. In order to help consumers make the right knife buying choices, I will add any updates or comments to this review. I'd also love to see other consumer reviews on these ZX Knives; a short review can be added to this page. ZX does offer a lifetime warranty on their knives.\nUpdate - Response received from ZX Kitchen Knives:\n\u201cWe so appreciate Mariette\u2019s review of zx kitchen\u2019s black ceramic knives. zx kitchen\u2122 has sold thousands of knives since we launched the company in 2011, and we have received overwhelming praise for the quality and durability of our products. We hope to make zx kitchen the next revolution in food preparation. Sharper than traditional steel cutlery, our ceramic knives slice flawlessly for five years with no need for re-sharpening. We would love for Mariette to try our steak knives, as slicing meats has never been easier. Because they are ceramic, in the rare occasion that one of our products does not live up to the standards of our customers or accidentally chips due to normal wear and tear, we will always send a replacement or offer a full refund.\" by zx kitchen CEO George Marks\nMy thoughts: I was very glad to receive the above response from the manufacturer.

OOTB most of them aren't real sharp. Now I know what many of you are thinking... hey, Rob- I have one and it was super sharp, the sharpest I've ever seen, smart guy! Be that as it may, it ain't the sharpest I've ever seen!\nTool steel, carbon steel and the best stainless steel knives will get much sharper than the ceramics you buy.\nCeramics are also relatively fragile. Some people have had good luck but it's a crap shoot. Ceramic is extremely strong but not very ductile (meaning malleable). It won't roll or bend to speak of- when subjected to enough shock or force it will simply snap. I've seen tips break off and ceramics snap clean in two.\nYou also won't have much luck sharpening them yourself. It can be done if you have the right equipment, but ceramic isn't all that far from diamond in hardness; Diamond is a 10 on the Mohs scale while the hardest ceramics are actually between 8 and 9. That means most of the things that can sharpen steel will hardly scratch ceramic. However, just as the Grand Canyon was worn by running water, the knife won't stay sharp forever. Constant use and impact with the cutting board will dull it over time. Especially glass cutting boards (glass can be nearly as hard as ceramic).\n__________________\nIf we're not supposed to eat animals, then how come they're made out of meat?\n12-29-2010, 01:57 AM\n"}, {"score": 1323.0367, "uuid": "33512041-3f0f-5b3d-8c40-4f0845c7ab8f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1003wb-97-22011", "target_hostname": "forums.winespectator.com", "target_uri": "http://forums.winespectator.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/5086097161/m/1847061132/p/2", "page_rank": 1.205161e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>I</em> need new <em>Knives</em> - Topic", "snippet": "If the <em>steel</em> can be sharpened to a great edge, <em>I</em> don&#x27;t care what the <em>steel</em> is composed of. <em>I</em> also want the handle to fit my hand.

If it doesn't seem somehow right to you, go buy a different one.\nA knife is a tool and I'd buy them the way I'd buy any tool.\nWe all know people who buy based on what they've read or heard about something - high-priced shoes and they run 1/2 mile a week, or super high-end bicycles and they ride only on sunny Sunday afternoons, or high-priced stereo and speakers and they listen to Frank Sinatra. I have zero problem with those folks and if they're happy, good for them.\nI have some tools that my grandfather picked up in the 1940s and earlier. He was a woodworker and an artist. I have far better tools than he'd ever have dreamed of, but it's what you do with them that matters, and part of what you do with them has to do with how well they work for you. We still have his table saw, which was a Craftsman model from the 1920s and which he used to produce amazing furniture and inlay work.\nI happen to dislike the shun knives. Doesn't mean they're crap and not worth whatever someone wants to pay for them, but I want the bolster and some weight in my knife. Lightweight sucks as you have to work harder. If the steel can be sharpened to a great edge, I don't care what the steel is composed of. I also want the handle to fit my hand. My hand is pretty big and there are plenty of expensive knives that just seem to to small.\nSo my suggestion is to try a few, find the ones you like, and buy those. I have some Sabatier knives and the steel is great and I use them a lot, but they don't actually feel all that great. I have some Wusthof knives and they feel great as far as balance and size, but oddly enough, I prefer the Sabatier steel. And I have some Chicago Cutlery knives, that are supposed to be cheapest, but they feel best in my hand, they're completely unpretentious, and the steel sharpens really well. They cut onions, garlic, oranges, duck, parsley, and whatever else I want to cut. And they do it well. I use about three knives all the time - a chef's knife, a boning knife, and a paring knife.\nWe have many others, but they're rarely used. And we have a few santoku knives that I really don't like all that much.\nIt's like buying a Craftsman screwdriver from Sears or something else. Sometimes that Craftsman is just fine. So buy what you feel like you can happily work with every day.\n\"The best part is how he said the ENGLISH language. Fine irony.

There\u2019s another job for this evening. When <em>I</em> worked in a professional kitchen, <em>I</em> used the <em>steel</em> every day before using any knife for work.", "explanation": null, "document": "Keeping your kitchen knives sharp is one of those jobs where a little bit of effort every now and again saves a lot of trouble in the long run.\nWhy is it so important to have sharp knives?\nThere are three main reasons.\nThe first is safety. Sharp knives cut easily through whatever it is you\u2019re trying to cut. Blunt knives require more force, and more force means less control \u2013 particularly if you slip. And slipping is far more likely with a blunt knife. (Have you ever had difficulty getting started when slicing a tomato? Then your knife wasn\u2019t sharp enough.)\nThe second is simple efficiency. It takes a lot more effort to cut food using a blunt knife than it does with a sharp one. Use a sharp knife, and you\u2019ll get finished faster and get a lot less tired in the process. You\u2019ll probably find the process a lot more satisfying, too.\nThe third concerns the food itself. A blunt blade needs more force to push it through the food. That force gets spread more widely throughout the food, bruising it around the cut. As a result, you lose flavour, and the appearance isn\u2019t helped either. This also explains why it\u2019s best to have a really sharp knife when chopping onions \u2013 the sharper the knife, the less you cry.\nHow do I keep my knives sharp?\nThe best way is by regular use of a steel to hone your knives. (Not \u2018sharpen\u2019 them, you\u2019ll note. Sharpening is what you do to create the edge, not to maintain it \u2013 and it\u2019s a more heavy-duty process that involves grinding the blade down using a stone or a mechanical grinding tool.)\nMost of us have a mental picture in our heads of how a steel should be used, involving the rapid brandishing of steel and knife in mid-air. While you can do it that way \u2013 and many professionals do \u2013 it\u2019s difficult, and involves a certain amount of risk that you\u2019ll cut yourself if your attention wanders.\nA safer way (and easier, if you\u2019re unused to honing knives) is to place a towel on your worktop or kitchen table and (using your non-knife wielding hand) hold the steel in front of you with the tip firmly on the towel, pointing straight downwards. Place the heel end of the edge of the blade against the top of the steel\u2019s grooved surface, so that the edge meets the steel at an angle of about 20 degrees. (20\u00b0 is the angle to which most manufacturers grind their blades). Then, using moderate pressure and maintaining the 20\u00b0 angle, draw the knife towards you and down so that the whole length of the blade \u2013 right to the tip! \u2013 is pulled against the steel at the correct angle. About five times on each side of the edge should be enough, if you do it regularly.\nHow often should I hone my knives?\nThis depends on how often you use them and \u2013 to a certain extent \u2013 what you use them on, especially in terms of what work surface you use. Wooden boards (particularly end-grain wooden boards, like butcher\u2019s blocks) are kinder on your edges than plastic; glass and marble \u201cchopping boards\u201d are a disaster. Once a week will probably be enough in most cases, though you may want to do it more frequently than that for the knives you use most often, and vice versa. And the more often you do it, the less effort you\u2019ll need to put into doing it each time.\nWhat sort of steel should I use? Are diamond and ceramic steels better than steel ones?\nUse a steel made of steel, with a medium or fine grooved surface; the longer the better. (Too short, and you\u2019ll find it hard to get the right honing action. A good guide to go by is the length of your longest blade plus five centimetres/two inches.) The diamond and ceramic steels last longer, but they\u2019re for sharpening rather than honing. A steel steel generally lasts for three to four years in normal use.\nAll this may seem like a bit of a chore, but it\u2019s worth persevering with. With a bit of practice, you\u2019ll soon have it down to a fine art \u2013 and you\u2019ll find your cooking becomes more enjoyable as a result.\nAs usual, I recommend Nisbets for kitchen equipment.

When the LAWKS lever is pushed forward with a flick of the thumb, the knife becomes a virtual fixed blade, and the locking liner is virtually impossible to release by the most vigorous use until the LAWKS lever is retracted.\nEven though LAWKS\u00ae increased our engineering and manufacturing costs significantly, we believe that the superior security and safety it offers is worth it to our customers. Today, CRKT locking liner folders designed for heavy-duty work and tactical use come with LAWKS as standard equipment.\nAs good as LAWKS is, our military and law enforcement consultants pointed out that an operator may not have time to think about actuating the LAWKS lever during a sudden tactical event.\nOur new patented and exclusive AutoLAWKS answers that question: it automatically actuates when an AutoLAWKS-equipped folder is opened and locked, creating a virtual fixed blade instantly. A powerful spring inside the handle forces the AutoLAWKS cam forward, and a metal bar prevents the locking liner from releasing accidentally.\nOne-hand closing is still easy. Just pull the AutoLAWKS lever back with the index finger and press in the locking liner with the thumb. The blade will release and can be closed with gentle pressure of the index finger while you rotate the handle in the palm of your hand.\nOverall, we believe that AutoLAWKS is the most advanced knife safety improvement of its kind, and we are proud to introduce it on many CRKT locking liner folders.\nHIGH CALIBER KNIVES MAKE FOR GOOD HUNTING OR FISHING\nDMT - DIAMOND MACHINING TECHNOLOGY, INC\nDMT ADVANTAGE\nDIAMOND MACHINING TECHNOLOGY - THE BENCHMARK FOR DIAMOND SHARPENERS\nFor over thirty years, DMT has been the leader in, and innovator of, a full range of diamond sharpening products that are dependable and solve a multitude of sharpening, honing or deburring needs. DMT's patented and award-winning products are known for their superior quality and versatility, are easy to use and allow for sharpening in a fraction of the time required by other methods. DMT products are popular with woodworkers, chefs and gardeners, in the kitchen, workshop or tool room, or to take camping, hiking, skiing, hunting and fishing.\nWHY DMT DIAMOND?\nDMT Diamond Sharpeners are an excellent value because of their durable construction, quality and reputation for providing years of uncompromising service. Unlike conventional oilstones, Japanese waterstones, Arkansas stones and other ceramic sharpeners, DMT Diamond Whetstones will not break, chip, crack, hollow or groove. Do not be fooled by other diamond sharpeners made in other countries who claim their products are just as good - If you want the best care for your edge, demand DMT!\nFAST- Hardest material, most efficient sharpening abrasive. Available in unique interrupted surface and continuous surface.\nEASY- Light pressure produces a sharp edge with just a few strokes.\nCLEAN- Use water for lubrication - no oil, smell or mess.\nVERSATILE- Hones ALL hard materials: carbide, steel, etc.\nDURABLE- Starts flat, stays flat.\nDMT Diamond Whetstones are renown for their remarkable sharpening speed. The sharpening speed of DMT products is a function of the quality of the micronized super abrasive, monocrystalline Diamond.\nMONOCRYSTALLINE Diamond (a strong, single crystal)\nUniform and precisely sized Monocrystalline Diamond is permanently bonded to nickel on a precision ground plate. Approximately two thirds of each crystal is embedded in the nickel with one third exposed. Because Diamonds are the hardest material known, the working abrasive points (top third of the diamond) will wear very slowly to give a long product life. Extremely pure, DMT diamond crystals permit a single layer of diamond to perform for years. Competitors claims of multiple layers of diamond only indicate poor quality diamond that quickly wears.\nPOLYCRYSTALLINE Diamond\nOur competition uses this fragmented compound that breaks apart and wears away easily with use. Sharpeners made with Polycrystalline Diamond will wear out and need replacement.\nEASY CARE AND USAGE\nYour DMT Diamond Whetstone is a precision tool. When used with reasonable care, it will give you many years of faithful service.\nBreak-in period: Initially your diamond stone will seem especially rough. It will smooth over time with gentle stroking without impacting performance. You need not exert extra pressure - let the diamonds do the work!\nUse only light pressure when sharpening. As a rule, 5-10 minutes on a conventional oilstone is equal to about 20 seconds on DMT Diamond Sharpeners.\nUse only water as a lubricant. A lubricant is only necessary to speed the process of clearing swarf (material removed during sharpening) into the recessed dots.\nAfter use, rinse and dry your diamond sharpener. Store dry. When further cleaning is needed, use an abrasive cleaner (non-petroleum base) and a scrub brush. Always store your diamond sharpener clean and dry or the metal fines removed during sharpening will rust if left on the surface.\nDMT WARRANTY\nThe DMT Commitment - For over a quarter century, DMT has been committed to one thing - to innovate and produce the world's finest diamond knife and tool sharpeners. All DMT products are made using the highest quality materials and workmanship and are guaranteed to be free of defects. Any products found to be defective will be replaced free of charge - it's that simple!\nDMT SURFACES\nDMT offers a full product line of sharpeners with a variety of surface composition. Some products are tailored in shape and size for specific sharpening needs. The interrupted and continuous surfaces are layered in micronized Monocrystalline diamond embedded in nickel, a DMT proprietary process. Diamond as we know it, is the hardest substance and can sharpen or hone any material (more on this). Our new line of unbreakable ceramic sharpeners are best used for putting a polished edge on a tool after it has been sharpened by a more coarse diamond grit.\nWhen compared with conventional sharpening stones, all DMT products work faster and sharpen exceedingly quick using light pressure.. and they remain flat! It is important to note that all DMT diamond products are manufactured to the same high standard using the same high-quality monocrystalline diamond that makes sharpening with DMT superior. Therefore the difference between the two diamond product lines becomes a matter of preference to the user. Read further to learn more about the differences between the surfaces and which DMT products are right for you.\nINTERRUPTED DIAMOND SURFACES\nThese products carry our signature polka-dot pattern surfaces. The polka dots are slightly recessed so that during sharpening the metal fines (known as swarf) and small amount of material that is being removed will fall into the polka dots and remain out of the way of the sharpening surface keeping the sharpening surface performing.\nCONTINUOUS DIAMOND SURFACES\nContinuous diamond surface sharpeners are preferred when sharpening small-pointed tools and can be used for knife and tool sharpening, honing and deburring as well. On an interrupted surface the point of a small tool may get caught in a recess and damage the surface of the sharpener. DMT therefore recommends that you use a continuous diamond or ceramic surface for these types of tools.\nUNBREAKABLE CERAMIC SURFACES\n*NEW* UNBREAKABLE Ceramic! Our new Ceramic and Ceramic Diamond SHARPENERS are our latest innovation and are the perfect compliment to your assortment of sharpening tools. The patented CeraFuse process transfoms the surface of aluminum to an extremely hard dense aluminum oxide that has the same properties of solid ceramic materials. With a finer grit than our bonded diamond products, they are unbreakable, wear resistant, light and non-porous. Our ceramic sharpeners are the next step to achieving a polished edge.\nHIGH CALIBER KNIVES MAKE FOR GOOD HUNTING OR FISHING\nTop of Page\nABOUT EMERSON KNIVES\nFounded IN 1997 by Ernest R. Emerson and Wife Mary, Emerson Knives, Inc. has become the most dominant force in the cutlery industry. Bringing a dynamic and energy to the knife industry never known before, Ernest Emerson has reshaped the face of the cutlery industry, as it is known today.\n\"My entire life has been dedicated to the pursuit of excellence. In athletics, education, physical fitness, training, business and knifemaking, I have never settled for second best and never will.

These <em>ceramic</em> stones polish the blade in every direction possible giving the surface a non-reflective <em>or</em> glazed appearance.", "explanation": null, "document": "The introduction of 1.2% Vanadium increases the steel\u0092s toughness and edge retention.\nWhat kind of care is needed for a Damascus blade?\nDamascus steel is not stainless so the carbon layers may corrode when exposed to acids such as orange juice or blood. We supply all Damascus blade Sebenzas with a small container of RIG (rust inhibiting grease). As a rule of thumb, the Damascus blade should be cleaned after each time the knife has been handled. Apply a small amount to the blade and immediately wipe clean using a soft cloth.\nThere is an extra hole on the Sebenza and Umfaan. What is it used for?\nThis is a tooling or locating hole and, in the finished knife, has no real function. The process goes something like this: we buy titanium in sheet form and cut it into rectangles approximately the size of the handle. We drill all the holes into this rectangle which is then placed onto a fixture, held secure by locating pins through these holes. The profile of the handle is then machined and the rectangle begins to look like the handle of a folding knife. It is at this stage that we select left or right-handed knives. We sometimes use the hole as part of the graphic on the decorated models and sometimes enlarge the hole and inlay a cabochon into it.\nCan I have serrations added to my folder or one-piece knife?\nThe Project I and II come standard with serrations. If you desire, they can be added to the other knives as well for a nominal fee. However, when serrations are added to the blade you sacrifice a good portion of the cutting edge, and add an additional 4 \u0096 6 weeks to the delivery time. One consideration to keep in mind is whether or not your knife usage warrants serrations. If you don\u0092t have practical usage applications, we suggest not putting them on the blade.\nHow is the coloring of the decorated areas achieved?\nThe concept of our folding knives is very versatile. No matter how much we dress up the knife, it is, first and foremost, functional. The Computer Generated and Unique Graphic models offer a way of making the knife unique and distinct because we machine a graphic onto the handle. The front face of the handle is polished and a graphic is machined into it. We use a variety of techniques, but mostly the machining is done in a way that can best be described as \"painting with a milling machine\". The graphic is then colored using a process called electrolytic oxidation or anodizing. We immerse the titanium handle in a solution and as current is passed through the solution, oxygen is produced on the surface of the titanium. The oxygen reacts with the titanium to form a thin oxide layer. As the voltage is increased, the oxide layer grows in thickness. The colors that are produced are the direct result of how the light is refracted through the oxide layer. For our purposes, we start out at 12 volts to produce a light yellow color. The colors to follow are gold, gold brown, brown maroon, maroon purple, purple blue, dark blue, and light blue at 35 volts.\nWho actually makes the knives?\nChris began his knife making career as a part time custom maker, working out of the garage beside his home in Durban, South Africa. In January 1984, he began working full time at making knives and his business has grown over the past fifteen years into a small company, employing skilled assistants. Chris now manages the business, designs the products and oversees production rather than physically making the knives, but his dedication to innovation, quality and integrity remains as firm today as it ever has been. Scott Cook, who is a talented knife maker in his own right, is our workshop foreman. He coordinates production and grinds the majority of the blades. He does most of the graphic design and coloring of the decorated model Sebenzas. He is assisted in the wide variety of tasks by Bryan Baker, Rahn Olaso and Tim Buck.\nWhat are the Computer Generated Graphics and Unique Graphics?\nWe know that ordering of decorated models of Sebenzas and Umfaans can get rather complicated so we have made some changes to ease the process. The knives that have been known as \"Decorated\" models will now be known as \"Unique Graphic\" models. These will still be the one-of-a-kind, random designs that you have ordered in the past. We have introduced a new line called \"Computer Generated Graphics\". These consist of a series of seven standard designs; each can be ordered by name. All of the designs begin as sketches on a pad of paper. The sketches are drawn in the computer using CAD/CAM software (computer aided drawing/computer aided machining), which converts the design into a program for the computer controlled milling machine. Once stored in the computer, a design can be recalled and made again as many times as needed. The model previously known as the Fly Design has been added to this group and is now called the Pheasant Tail. This precedes other styles of Fly Designs that we plan to introduce in due course.\nNote: For the most part, the Unique Graphic knives have one-of-a-kind designs and we do not duplicate them exactly. Sometimes, however, we will produce a limited edition that might have the same graphic, but each knife will be numbered ensuring its collectibility.\nHow is the lanyard tied?\nThis is a question that is asked quite often. For those of you who remove the cord for some reason or those who simply wish to use a different cord, we offer the following step-by-step instructions for retying the lanyard. Please note that these are written for right-handed individuals. Left-handed instructions are available upon request.

Finest Japanese Blade Steel\"\nA VERY unique knife design! What I first saw this I thought they were crazy. But then I got two in for evaluation and wow, they work! The handle starts out like a regular handle (at the heel of the blade), but as it moves away towards the end it flattens out, and this part sits perfectly in the palm of your hand. The result is that it's remarkably easy, comfortable and stable to hold. As a test I put the santoku and the 9.5\" chef's knife in my knife block at home but I didn't say anything to my wife. Would she keep using the Wusthof or would she even try the Chroma (she's not a knife fanatic like me, and not especially interested in trying new gadgets)? Before I knew it I noticed her using the santoku almost daily for the usual family meal vegetable and chicken chopping -- she finds it comfortable, sharp, and easy to use. She won't admit that they look cool too, but I think she secretly likes the sexy stainless look. And the prices are reasonable, so why not! I also find them quite easy maintain -- they take an edge easily and keep it quite a while.\nThis is from the Choma literature:\nThe advantages Type 301 are:\nAn ergonomic handle - designed by F.A. Porsche working with the chef of the decade, J\u00f6rg W\u00f6rther\nA metal \"pearl\" that clearly demarcates the end of the handle, for better control when cutting\nA seamless perfection and hygienic transition from blade to handle\nA special grinding method is used, so the knife stays sharp longer and is easier to sharpen\nPlease note the following instructions to insure the knife remains in optimal condition for years to come (these are good instructions to keep in mind for ANY good knife):\nNever place the knife in the dishwasher. Hand wash and dry after every use.\nRegularly sharpen the knife using a whetstone or ceramic. A sharpening steel is not recommended (note from Paul: I've used a steel on mine; with a light touch and minimal swipes, I find it resets the edge just fine.As with any good tool, take care with maintenance and don't abuse it. Your mileage my vary.)\nStore the knife in a safe, secure manner, for example, in a knife block so the blade is not left exposed.\nOnly use wooden or plastic cutting boards, never marble or glass.\nOnly use the knife to prepare food. Do not use it to cut frozen foods, bones, or as a utility knife.\nKnives with a serrated blade, such as the bread and tomato knives, should only be sharpened by a certified professional.\nNote: the lengths stated by Chroma are measured from the tip to the metal \"pearl\" -- the actual blade length (from tip to the heel or handle-side of the edge) is approx. 1 to 3 cm shorter (1 cm for the paring knives, 3 cm for the longer knives).\nGreat Gifts! These knives come in spectacularly beautiful gift boxes! The best-looking boxes and packaging I've EVER seen for a knife. The boxes are hard cases, with a black textured finish outside, and inside the knives are secured in fitted hard foam inserts. The whole thing is then packed off in a beautiful colour slip-case.

Houman in Dazaifu, Fukuoka. His descendants then inherited his business and followed in his footsteps in the same city for 13 generations. In 1632, the family followed Higo Daimyo Mitsunari Hosokawa (the feudal ruler of Higo) and moved to Miyaji-machi, Yatsushiro, Kumamoto. For another 13 generations in this city, they forged swords for the Buddhist armies, the Daimyo's army, and also the Daimyo himself. Kongohyoue's swords were very unique because they were made and used to help attain Buddhahood. Five generations ago, master bladesmith Chuzaemon Moritaka decided to change the business direction and apply their forging experiences into kitchen knives. Moritaka Cutlery has a history of over 700 years. The knife that you purchase is forged with skills and knowledge developed and accumulated generation by generation.\nMoritaka's double-edged knives are made with a \"triple structure\" technique ( click here for a diagram). This is a method by which a layer of a solid super-hard carbon steel is sandwiched between 2 layers of softer iron. This combines the characteristics and advantages of iron and steel to produce blades that are super hard and sharp yet durable. The steel core is hardened using heat treatment techniques. The iron cladding is not as hard as the steel core, but is extremely long lasting, and is hand-forged with the steel core to provide durability. This technique is the feature that makes Japanese samurai swords and metal forging renowned throughout the world. Moritaka handcrafts knives using this \u201ctriple structure\u201d technique because they believe it is an essential part of producing the best quality knives. While there are advanced technologies available to produce cheap, fast and mass-produced knives, nothing compares to the workmanship of a truly hand-made Japanese knife.\nEdge: All these knives feature a 50/50 bevel edge for easy sharpening, and right or left-hand use.\nSteel: \"Aogami Super steel\" (\"AS\", or \"Blue Super\") is considered by many to be the highest quality steel available, however it is a very difficult material to work with, requiring only the most experienced and skilled bladesmiths to produce a successful result. Blue Super Steel knives can mantain a razor sharp edge longer than other knives, as this high carbon steel is an alloy which contains carbon steel along with chromium, tungsten, molybdenum and vanadium which add toughness and durability. \"Aogami #2 Steel\" (\"A2\", or \"Blue 2\") is a more pure carbon steel that is similar to Aogami Super but does not contain molybdenum or vanadium. Theoretically a more pure carbon steel (such as Aogami #2) is easier to sharpen to a razor-sharp edge and should maintain it longer, but at the expense of being potentially more brittle and so more prone to cracking or chipping of the edge and/or tip. The added elements in Aogami Super should make it tougher and more resilient and less brittle, though at this level there are many other factors that affect the final result, such as heat treating and handling by the bladesmith, so it really does come down to personal preference and the individual knife. Both steels are very hard -- in the Rockwell/HRC 61-63 range for the most part (again, depending on many factors introduced during the crafting process) so each can take a razor sharp and very thin and fine edge. There are as many opinions on the subject of the \"best\" steel as there are knife makers and enthusiasts/owners. Just know that these knives are all made by master craftsmen who know the properties of the steels they use VERY well and so will create a superb knife every time, no matter the steel. So my suggestion: don't worry too much about one steel or the other... buy the knife you want at the price you can afford and I'm sure you'll be thrilled. But remember: this is CARBON steel, NOT stainless, so you must hand wash (they are NOT dishwasher-safe!), dry and store (I recommend a wooden knife block) them after use to avoid rusting. Never leave them in a sink, and avoid cutting or maintaining contact with very acidic items (lemons for example). A drop of food-grade mineral or other neutral oil rubbed on the blade will also help prevent rusting. The blades will discolour and take on a patina with use (like a cast iron pan for example) -- this is normal and desired, and contributes to the character of carbon steel knives. In return though, you'll get a knife that takes an amazing razor-sharp edge very easily and quickly because the steel is so hard (compared to most stainless steel knives which as softer and paradoxically harder to sharpen due to the alloy) and carbon steel knives should also keep that edge far longer than just about any stainless steel knife out there.\nHandles: Note: handles have a subtle D-shape to them which makes them more suitable to right-handle use. I do have left-handed customers using them just fine, but it's not necessarily ideal.\nClick here to see how Moritaka knives are individually hand-crafted in Japan.\nMaintenance/Sharpening: For everyday maintenance I recommend the 10\" fine ceramic hone (rod) which when used regularly (every day for heavy use, or at least once a week for light/occasional home use) will easily keep your knife sharp for a year or more. When honing no longer works and your edge really need re-working, I recommend a Japenese waterstone or for the best results, though you may also use a quality machine or gadget like one of the Chef's Choice units designed specifically for Asian knives. Carbon steel knives should not be used to cut very acidic items (lemons for example) which can discolour the blade and potentially lead to pitting if left in contact with acids. Hand-wash only (NOT dishwasher) -- wash and dry as soon as possible after use, and store safely (I recommend a wooden knife block). Never leave in water or a sink. The thin and sharp and hard edges give fantastic performance, but the tradeoff is that they will not tolerate abuse like a cheap stainless steel knife -- do NOT cut bones or other hard items; doing so can damage the knife (crack or chip the edge or tip) and this is not covered under any warranty. Save good knives like this for your precision work and keep a cheap stainless knife for whacking bones and root vegetables and squash for example.\nAbout the different lines:\nDeluxe Aogami #2 Carbon Steel (Blue 2 Steel)\nThese knives are made from Blue 2 carbon steel, with a permanent seasoned rosewood handle and a stainless steel tang. These knives should take a GREAT edge and be easy to sharpen and to keep sharp. The rosewood handle should be MUCH longer-lasting than the softer and lighter magnolia wood usually seen on traditional Japanese knives, and the stainless steel tang inside the handle means that any moisture will not result in premature pitting or damage to the handle. The finish is kuro-uchi (black) with a lacquer coating -- this helps protect the steel and should not be polished off.\nSupreme Aogami Super Carbon Steel (Blue Super Steel)\nThese knives are made from Blue Super carbon steel, with a permanent seasoned rosewood handle and a stainless steel tang. These blades should take a super sharp edge and the added toughness of the Blue Super steel should help with edge strength and resistance. The rosewood handle should be MUCH longer-lasting than the softer and lighter magnolia wood usually seen on traditional Japanese knives, and the stainless steel tang inside the handle means that any moisture will not result in premature pitting or damage to the handle. The finish is kuro-uchi (black) with a lacquer coating -- this helps protect the steel and should not be polished off.\nSupreme Damascus Clad Aogami Super Carbon Steel (Blue Super Steel)\nThese are Supreme series knives that have been clad in a beautiful stainless damascus steel instead of soft iron, so you get additional beauty and stain-resistance.

In Ceramic Carving Tool Techniques: Bringing the Ceramic Surface to Life, you will learn to go further, bringing the form and surface of your work together into a signature style using a variety of clay carving tools in combination with carving techniques like sgraffito, etching, wire-cutting, relief carving, and more.\nHere\u2019s an excerpt:\nAdvice on the Best Tools for Carving, Cutting, Scratching, and Slashing Clay\nby Robin Hopper\nAn infinite variety of graphic marks can be made in soft clay through the use of a wide assortment of knives, forks, scalpels, welding rods, wire-ended or wooden modeling tools, sticks, bones, awls, needles, saws, wires, kitchen utensils and just about anything that can be creatively employed to produce an image, mark or sign. The nature of working with tools is such that artists usually develop favorites that seem to become extensions of their hands. Most potters and ceramic artists I know seem to have boxes of tools selected or made for specific processes of surface enrichment. They invariably are seeking the one tool that will out-perform all others, feel better in the hand or just be more pleasurable in use.\nTools either can be purchased or found objects. In sensitive hands, sometimes the most unlikely looking implements give the greatest results. Almost any tool takes time to give out its secrets for best use, so continued play or exploration of potential is a given if you want to use tools to their optimum level. Slight variations of pressure, twist or movement can produce or reveal the most amazing complexity of marks from even the simplest of tools.\nTools and Methods\nThe tools that seem to perform best with either soft or leather-hard clay - the states where most slashing, scratching, carving and cutting is done - primarily are tools with sharp points or edges. Clays generally are abrasive, finely granular materials that quickly will take the edge off of softer metal tools. Most cutting tools perform best when kept sharp. The types of material used for ceramic tool making varies from fairly soft alloy metals to knife-quality steel and beyond, into tungsten carbide, a fine, very hard crystalline material.\nThe price of the tool often will indicate the quality. The better the quality, the more efficiently it will do the jobs required of it. Inexperienced clay workers often blame themselves for problems caused by tools that are inadequate for the job. Potters\u2019 tools that are packaged as beginner sets often make an already difficult process more so with unsatisfactory tools that quickly become dull from abrasion, causing unwanted \u201cchattering,\u201d or bouncing, of the tool on the clay because it is too dull to cut properly.\nThe best tools usually are individually handmade by small companies that understand exactly what the potter needs from personal experience and discussion with the people who use them. Tools made from high-quality knife steel, such as those made by Dolan Tools, will outperform soft metal tools and keep an edge against the abrasive qualities of clay for a long time. Knife steel easily can be sharpened with a file to maintain a sharp cutting edge.\nThe best and most long-lasting edge on pottery cutting tools is provided by tungsten carbide, a material considerably harder than steel. Even though it is very hard, crystalline tungsten carbide is extremely brittle, and tools made from it should be used carefully. Avoid dropping these tools on hard surfaces, as they may break. Tungsten carbide tools usually are individually handmade by small companies, such as Bison Tools.\nAlthough more expensive than metal tools, the cutting quality of tungsten carbide tools is much better. They even are capable of trimming and cutting through bisque ware! Should they require sharpening, they can be returned to the company.\nFor the serious potter, tungsten carbide tools are probably the most satisfactory tools, turning what was often mundane work into sheer pleasure. Buy the best tools you can afford, or make your own using the best materials you can afford.\nCutting\nThe way clay cuts depends on both the state of the material and the cutting tool. As a general rule when using knives and scalpels, the stiffer the clay, the more easily controlled the cut, and the softer the clay, the more resistance there will be to the cutting tool. Clay tends to cause the knife blade to drag by sticking to its surface.\nWire Cutting\nThe potter\u2019s wire is much more than a tool for separating a thrown pot from the wheelhead or throwing bat. It can be simply a flexible wire with a handle at each end, or it can be fitted into a handle similar to a small woodworker\u2019s bow saw and tightened to form a rigid cutting edge. Such a tool can have numerous interchangeable plain or twisted cutting wires to give a wide variation of possible cuts.\nThe twist wire shows multiple cuts that pick up on the features of the glaze, emphasizing the thick and thin qualities. Twisted wires with a much greater textural emphasis can be made from sprung wire curtain rod, which is often used for stringing kitchen curtains and is usually covered with a plastic coating. This can be found in old-fashioned hardware stores. After removing the plastic coating, the wire can be gripped with needle-nosed pliers and stretched to create a variety of wavelike patterns of grooves. Pulling this type of wire through soft clay and moving it from side to side will give a surface evocative of sandy beaches after the tide has receded. Using the process of slab making by throwing a block of clay on a hard surface, wire cutting it into slabs and pulling and stretching the sheets of soft textured clay on a hard surface allows for a great variety of expanded patterns.\nCarving\nSurface carving is usually done best with a variety of tools\u2014from knives and gouges to wire-ended modeling tools\u2014when the clay is leather-hard. The thickness of the objects to be carved should be considered carefully early in the process.\nSurface Expansion\nCreating linear images in soft slabs of clay or in soft thrown clay cylindrical forms and then pushing from beneath or inside the thrown form allows expansion of the image and textural development at the same time. Spraying or brushing the surface with a solution of sodium silicate and quick drying it with a blowtorch or heat gun while leaving the underside or inside of the form quite soft will produce remarkable surface textures when the clay expands from beneath or inside. Often resembling aged, tooled leather, these textured surfaces react well with thinly sprayed colorants or glazes or when fired in wood, salt or soda firing kilns.\nCeramic Carving Tool Techniques: Bringing the Ceramic Surface to Life also includes:\nConsiderations for Carving Clay\nby Emily Reason\nCarving into a clay surface can be very gratifying, but when you\u2019re making pieces for use, you need to be mindful that the carving accentuates the function, rather than hindering it. Being attentive to a few basic design considerations will help you keep your clay carving appropriate to the form.\nMaking and Glazing Incised Ware\nby Ann Selberg\nWhether you work with sgraffito, relief carving, incized line decoration, or some other clay carving technique, there are a few tricks to successfully glazing ware with carved surfaces.\nAbout Ceramic Arts Daily:\nCeramic Arts Daily is a free online website and newsletter written and produced for the benefit of potters and ceramic artists worldwide.

What is the ceramic knife warranty? How do I care for a ceramic knife? The answers to these questions and more are readily available.\nWhat are the uses for different Knives and Kitchen tools?\nWhat are ceramic knives made of?\nThese knives are made of an advanced, high-tech ceramic called zirconium oxide (also called zirconia). Zirconium oxide is extremely hard, wear resistant, and chemically inert. For the technically minded, zirconium oxide has a hardness of 8.2 mohs (vs. steel at 5-6 mohs and diamond at 10 mohs).\nHow do I sharpen ceramic knives?\nYou can resharpen your ceramic knife by using our resharpening service. Only Kyocera advanced ceramic knives can be sharpened with this service. We also offer a ceramic knife sharpener for Kyocera knives. It's a great at-home solution to refreshen and resharpen Kyocera blades.\nWill a ceramic knife break if I drop it?\nAny knife, whether stainless steel or ceramic, will potentially break at the tip if its dropped on a hard surface at a certain angle. Unfortunately, accidental damage can occur so we do offer resharpening services.\nHow can I damage a ceramic knife?\nTwo ways. First, you can chip the edge if you cut into bones. Second, you can break off the tip or snap off the handle if you use it to pry or twist.\nCan I put my ceramic knife in the dishwasher?\nWe do not recommend this for several reasons. First, it's dangerous if someone forgets about the knife or reaches in the wrong way. Second, violent motion against other objects, especially hard plates, could chip the objects and/or the knife. Third, dishwashers ruin wood handles. Finally, ceramic knives are very easy to clean with a hand washing or mild bleach solution (blade only).\nDo Kyocera knives come with a warranty?\nAll Kyocera knives comes with a\u00a0lifetime warranty . (pdf/105KB)\nWhere should I store my Kyocera ceramic knife?\nYou can store your Kyocera ceramic knife in a conventional knife block, in an in-drawer tray, or in the package.\nWhere can I buy Kyocera ceramic knives?\nTo check for the nearest retailer, go to Where to Buy .\nWho do I contact if I want to sell Kyocera knives in my store?\nEmail us at cpd@kyocera.com . We service retailers both directly and through our network of manufacturer's representatives.\nWhere are Kyocera knives made?\nKyocera advanced ceramic knives are made in Japan.\nHow should I use my Kyocera ceramic knife?\nFor slicing fruits, vegetables and boneless meats, a Kyocera advanced ceramic knife has no equal. Even so, ceramic knives are intended to complement -- not replace -- your other cutlery. Use steel knives for carving, prying, boning, cutting frozen foods, and slicing cheese. Avoid flexing or prying. Always use them on a plastic or wood cutting board and avoid cutting on marble, stone or inappropriate surfaces like plates or kitchen tile. For more information, please see our care and use instructions. (pdf/52KB)\nWhat is the difference between a black-HIP blade and a white blade?\nA black (HIP) blade is made out of a black zirconium oxide and offers extra durability. This type of blade goes through an extra firing process called a \"hot-isostatic press,\" creating a tighter weave between the ceramic molecules, thus creating a tougher blade. The white ceramic blade is also made out of zirconium oxide but does not go through this expensive sintering process.\nCan I use a ceramic sharpening rod on a ceramic knife?\nNo. The ceramic sharpeners are used to sharpen all steel-based knives, including titanium because the same hardness principle applies. Ceramic is harder than all metals, so it is the ideal surface to re-sharpen these softer materials.\nHow do I say \"Kyocera\" correctly?\nThe correct pronunciation is \"key-O-Sarah,\" which comes from \"Kyoto Ceramics,\" the original name of the company.\nWhat else does Kyocera make?\nKyocera is one of the world's leaders in advanced ceramics and electronics. We manufacture a wide variety of products including semiconductor packages, capacitors, thermal print heads, resistors, cutting tool inserts, circuit substrates, LCD panels, fiber optic components, car engine components, solar modules, laser printers, wielding nozzles, cellular/PHS phones, pump components, synthetic gemstones, thread and wire guides, antenna mounts, and lots of other neat stuff!\nWhat are ceramic scissors made of?\nThese scissors are made of an advanced, high-tech ceramic called zirconium oxide (also called zirconia). This material, which is second in hardness only to diamond, was originally developed for industrial applications where metal components failed. Zirconium oxide is extremely hard, wear resistant, and chemically inert. For the technically minded, zirconium oxide has a hardness of 8.2 mohs (vs. steel at 5-6 mohs and diamond at 10 mohs).\nWill ceramic scissors break if I drop them?\nCeramic scissors will not shatter when dropped. Like forged steel scissors, however, you can break the tip if the scissors land on the tip (very uncommon). You can also damage ceramic scissors by trying to cut very thick material or by trying to bend the blades. Ceramic blades are strong, but not flexible.\nDo you replace peeler blades?\nYes, many of blades on our peelers can be replaced.

Bibliography\nI.WHAT MAKES A STEEL PERFORM?\nA. Introduction\nSteel is the heart of the blade. The search for higher-performance\nsteels has to a number of wonderful materials in recent years. Steel\nby itself isn't the sole determiner of knife performance, of course.\nHeat treatment, blade geometry, handle geometry and materials all\neffect how a knife performs for a particular job. However, those\nother qualities can be difficult to measure. You can't tell by\nlooking at it how well a blade has been heat-treated, and you can only\nmake educated guesses on how well the blade and handle geometry will\nwork. With steel, however, you can get a full listing of its alloying\nelements, something measureable and somehow satisfying.\nAs a result, it's easy to fall into the trap of putting too much\nemphasis on the steel itself. A knife is more than steel, and it's\nimportant not to forget that. In addition, many modern steels perform\nso well, that knife decisions can often be made based on other factors\nthan marginal increases in steel performance.\nThe question of \"what's the best steel\" or \"rank the following steels\nin order from best to worst\" often comes up. The resulting replies\ncan never be totally accurate, because depending on the jobs the knife\nwill be used for, the blade geometry, and the quality of the heat\ntreat, what is \"best\" and what is \"worst\" can be very fluid. If you\nwant to make an educated decision about steels, try to learn the\nbasics of steel properties, and go from there.\nB. Sharpening for performance\nThat doesn't mean that significant performance advantages can't be had\nby choosing the right steel for the job. In fact, choosing a steel\ncan significantly impact the performance of a knife. But, to really\nbring out the performance of a particular steel, you need to take\nadvantage of the better steel in your sharpening plan. If a weak,\nbrittle steel can perform the job when sharpened at\n25-degrees-per-side, a strong, tough steel might give you some\nmarginal performance improvements if it, too, is sharpened at\n25-degrees-per-side. However, to really bring out the performance of\nthe better steel, trying bringing it down to 20-degrees per side, or\nless. The advantage of the better steel is that it is strong and\ntough enough to hold up with a small edge angle -- and smaller edge\nangles radically out-perform bigger edge angles. It's easy to get a\n10-to-1 perform advantage for certain cutting jobs by cutting 5\ndegrees off your sharpening angle.\nThis leads to the general rule:\nTo really see the advantages of a better steel, exploit that\nsteel in your sharpening program. If you're going to sharpen\nall your knives at the same angle regardless of steel, you\nmight de-emphasize steel choice somewhat.\nOn the internet, I'll often see someone posting about wanting to\nupgrade from their ATS-34 folder to one that has S30V, and then in a\ndifferent post, declare that they sharpen all their knives at\n20-degrees-per-side. Why spend all that extra money for S30V, just to\nget some marginal wear resistance advantages but no other performance\nadvantages? If that same user would take advantage of S30V's superior\ntoughness and drop the edge angle to 15-degrees-per-side, they would\nsee a large leap in cutting performance, along with the extra wear\nresistance. Because of choosing the right sharpening angle, the more\nexpensive S30V knife now gives an impressive return on investment.\n*Now* you can see what all the fuss is about!\nC. Design for performance\nIn the section above, we highlighted what the user can do to bring out\nthe best performance in a high-performance steel. But the user is\nonly half the equation; now we will look at what the knifemaker might\ndo with a higher- performance steel. As the knifemaker moves from one\nsteel to another, it is often possible to modify the design of a\nparticular knife to take advantage of the newer steel, and raise\nperformance.\nFor example, it is possible to make a hard-use \"tactical/utility\"\nknife from ATS-34. To make sure the ATS-34 will take the kind of\nstresses it might see in this environment, the edge might be left a\nbit thick (sacrificing cutting performance), or the hardness brought\ndown a touch (sacrificing strength and wear resistance), or both. If\nthe same maker moves to much-tougher S30V, he might be able to thin\nout the edge, thin out the entire knife, and raise the hardness,\nbringing up performance as a whole. Moving to differentially-tempered\n5160 might allow the maker to re-profile even more for performance.\nIf we're talking about a fighter, moving from 1095 to 3V might allow\nthe maker to make the knife much thinner, lighter, and faster, while\nsignificantly increasing cutting performance and maintaining edge\nintegrity.\nSo to really take advantage of the higher-performance steel, we want\nthe knifemaker to adjust the knife design to the steel, wherever he\nthinks it's appropriate. If a knifemaker offers the same knife in\nmultiple steels, ask about what the characteristics are in each steel,\nand the how's and why's of where the design has changed to accomodate\neach steel offered.\nNote that there can be good reasons that a knifemaker might not change\nthe blade profile even though the steel has changed. Maybe he's\nparticularly good at heat-treating one steel or another, so that the\ndifferences between disparate steels are minimized. Maybe the\nhigher-performance steel is not available in the next stock thickness\ndown. Maybe instead of higher cutting performance, the maker would\nrather offer the same cutting performance but in a knife that can take\nmore abuse. Maybe his customers tend to only buy thicker knives\nregardless of performance.\nSo work with the maker to understand the choices being made with the\ndifferent steels being offered. If you understand the kind of\nperformance you need, you'll be able to make a wise choice.\nD. Properties of performance steels\nWhat is it we're looking for in a steel, anyway? Well, what we are\nlooking for is strength, toughness, wear resistance, and edge\nholding. Sometimes, we're also looking for stain resistance.\nWear resistance: Just like it sounds, wear resistance is the ability\nto withstand abrasion. Generally speaking, the amount, type, and\ndistribution of carbides within the steel is what determines wear\nresistance.\nStrength: The ability to take a load without permanently\ndeforming. For many types of jobs, strength is extremely important.\nAny time something hard is being cut, or there's lateral stress put on\nthe edge, strength becomes a critical factor. In steels, strength is\ndirectly correlated with hardness -- the harder the steel, the\nstronger it is. Note that with the Rockwell test used to measure\nhardness in a steel, it is the hardness of the steel matrix being\nmeasured, not the carbides. This, it's possible for a softer, weaker\nsteel (measuring low on the Rockwell scale) to have more wear\nresistance than a harder steel. S60V, even at 56 Rc, still has more\nand harder carbides than ATS-34 at 60 Rc, and thus the S60V is more\nwear resistant, while the ATS-34 would be stronger.\nToughness: The ability to take an impact without damage, by which we\nmean, chipping, cracking, etc. Toughness is obviously important in\njobs such as chopping, but it's also important any time the blade hits\nharder impurities in a material being cut (e.g., cardboard, which\noften has embedded impurities).\nThe knifemaker will be making a tradeoff of strength versus toughness.\nGenerally speaking, within the hardness range that the steel performs\nwell at, as hardness increases, strength also increases, but toughness\ndecreases. This is not always strictly true, but as a rule of thumb\nis generally accurate. In addition, it is possible for different heat\ntreat formulas to leave the steel at the same hardness, but with\nproperties such as toughness, wear resistance, and stain resistance\nsignificantly differing.\nStain resistance (rust resistance): The ability to withstand rust\n(oxidation). Obviously, this property can be helpful in corrosive\nenvironments, such as salt water. In addition, some types of\nmaterials are acidic (e.g., some types of foods), and micro-oxidation\ncan lead to edge loss at the very tip of the edge, over a small amount\nof time. In \"stainless\" cutlery steels, stain resistance is most\naffected by free chromium -- that is, chromium that is not tied up in\ncarbides. So, the more chromium tied up in carbides, the less free\nchromium there is, which means more wear resistance but less stain\nresistance.\nEdge holding: The ability of a blade to hold an edge. Many people\nmake the mistake of thinking wear resistance and edge holding are the\nsame thing. Most assuredly, it is not; or rather, it usually is not.\nEdge holding is job-specific. That is, edge holding is a function of\nwear resistance, strength, and toughness. But different jobs require\ndifferent properties for edge holding. For example, cutting through\ncardboard (which often has hard embedded impurities), toughness\nbecomes extremely important, because micro-chipping is often the\nreason for edge degradation. Whittling very hard wood, strength\nbecomes very important for edge-holding, because the primary reason\nfor edge degradation is edge rolling and impaction. Wear resistance\nbecomes more important for edge holding when very abrasive materials,\nsuch as carpet, are being cut. And for many jobs, where corrosion-\ninducing materials are contacted (such as food prep), corrosion can\naffect the edge quickly, so corrosion resistance has a role to play\nas well.\nThere are other properties that significantly effect how a steel\nperforms:\nAbility to take an edge: Some steels just seem to take a much sharper\nedge than other steels, even if sharpened the exact same way.\nFiner-grained steels just seem to get scary sharp much more easily\nthan coarse-grained steels, and this can definitely effect\nperformance. Adding a bit of vanadium is an easy way to get a\nfine-grained steels. In addition, an objective of the forging process\nis to end up with a finer-grained steel. So both steel choice, and\nthe way that steel is handled, can effect cutting performance.\nManufacturing process: Cleaner, purer steels perform better than\ndirtier, impure steels. The cleaner steel will often be stronger and\ntougher, having less inclusions. High quality processes used to\nmanufacture performance steel include the Argon/Oxygen/Decarburization\n(AOD) process, and for even purer steel, the Vacuum Induction\nMelting/Vacuum Arc Remelting (VIM/VAR) process, often referred to as\n\"double vacuum melting\" or \"vacuum re-melting\".\nEdge toothiness: Some steels seem to cut aggressively even when razor\npolished. For these steels, even when they're polished for\npush-cutting, their carbides form a kind of \"micro serrations\" and\nslice aggressively.\nE. What's the \"best steel\".\nUnderstanding these properties will get you started to fundamentally\nunderstanding steels and how choice of steel can effect performance.\nI often see people asking, \"what's the best steel\"? Well, the answer\ndepends so much on what the steel is being used for, and how it's\nheat-treated, that the questioner can never possibly get an accurate\nanswer. For a knife lover, it's worth spending a little time\nunderstanding steel properties -- only by doing so well he really\nunderstand what the \"best steel\" might be for his application.\nPutting it all together, you can see how these properties might\ndetermine your steel choice. To pick on S60V and ATS-34 again, there\nseems to be a feeling that S60V is \"better\" in some absolute sense\nthan ATS-34. But S60V is often left very soft, around 55-56 Rc, to\nmake up for a lack of toughness. Even left that soft, an abundance of\nwell-distributed vanadium carbides gives S60V superior wear resistance\nto ATS-34, at acceptable toughness levels. However, does that mean\nS60V is \"better\" than ATS-34? Well, many users will find edge rolling\nand impaction the primary causes of edge degradation for everyday use.\nFor those users, even though S60V is more wear-resistant, S60V is also\nso soft and weak that they will actually see better edge retention\nwith ATS-34! The S60V user can leave the edge more obtuse (raise the\nsharpening angle) to put more metal behind the edge to make it more\nrobust, but now the S60V will suffer serious cutting performance\ndisadvantages versus the thinner ATS-34 edge.\nSo, the next general rule:\nKnowing the uses you'll put your knife to, and exactly how\nthose uses cause edge degradation, will allow you to make a\nmuch better choice of steel, if you generally understand steel\nproperties.\nThe properties of different steels will be laid out below. But in\nyour search for the knife with the \"best steel\" for your uses, I\nalways suggest you ask the makers of the knives you're considering\nwhich steels they would use. The knifemaker will usually know which\nsteels he can make perform the best. And as pointed out above, heat\ntreat is absolutely critical to bringing out the best in a steel. A\nmaker who has really mastered one particular steel (e.g., Dozier and\nD-2) might be able to make that steel work well for many different\nuses.

Decorated knives, damascus blades, inlays and customizing are all likely to take longer, sometimes as much as several months longer. We can often refer you to a dealer who may have the knife you are looking for, so please feel free to contact us.\nWhat is the best way to keep my Chris Reeve Knife sharp?\nOne important thing to remember with any knife is to maintain the edge - it is better to keep it reasonably sharp rather than let it get completely dull and then try to get the edge back.\u00a0 To maintain an optimal cutting edge on a Chris Reeve knife, we recommend the use of the Spyderco Tri-Angle Sharpmaker or a Lansky Sharpener.\u00a0 If you prefer to use a stone, the angle at which to sharpen will be best achieved at 18 - 20 degrees.\nWe will sharpen any knife we have made free of charge. We ask only that you pay for the return shipping.\u00a0 Simply return the knife (in its sheath if applicable), make sure that you include your address and phone number and we will restore that famous, hair-popping sharp, Chris Reeve Knives edge.\nWhat is the best lubricant to use on the folders?\nThe pivot of all folding knives needs to be kept lubricated for optimum performance.\u00a0 We have experimented with a wide variety of products and have found a Fluorinated Grease that is very slippery but does not get sticky or attract lint very easily. CRK Fluorinated Grease fits the tolerances of our folding knives well \u0096 other lubricants tend to be either too viscose so it interferes with the tolerance or too thin and it dissipates too quickly.\u00a0 CRK Fluorinated Grease is packaged in a syringe that allows you to put just a drop exactly where you need it.\u00a0 The rotating cap seals the tube and prevents leakage.\u00a0 It isn\u0092t necessary to use much because a little drop goes a long way.\nHow should I clean my Sebenza?\nDirt, sand, pocket lint, etc. can cause the action of the blade to become rough.\u00a0 To allow you to correct this, each Sebenza and Mnandi is supplied with an Allen wrench so that you can dismantle the knife, clean the hinge area and apply lubrication.\u00a0 One of our customers, Ted van der Voorde, took a lot of time in preparing a post on BladeForums.com, explaining how to assemble a Sebenza.\u00a0 He did a great job and has been gracious enough to allow us to reproduce his explanation here.\nHow to clean a Sebenza\nIf you run into a problem and just can't get it back\u00a0together, please feel free to put everything into a baggie and send it back to us.\u00a0 We will be more than happy to assemble the knife for you!\nPlease note that excessive flicking of the blade will also produce a rough action.\u00a0 Continuous wrist flicking will eventually damage the lock because the stop pin and back of the blade are not designed for that sort of continual shock.\nHow are the folding knife blades finished?\nThe blades on the regular models of the large and small Sebenzas are finished with what has become known as our stonewash finish. We accomplish this finish by tumbling the blades in an aggressive ceramic media.\u00a0 These ceramic stones polish the blade in every direction possible, giving the surface a non-reflective or glazed appearance.\u00a0 On the decorated models and on Mnandis, the hollow grind is polished on a cork belt giving a more traditional satin finish, an elegant contrast to the stonewashed flat surface of the blade.\u00a0 Both finishes are equally corrosion resistant and they all give better corrosion resistance than bead blasting or acid etch.\nCustom, Handmade or Production?\nThere has been much discussion over the differences in these three categories and we want to make it clear where our knives belong.\u00a0 Although all the knives that we offer now were, in the very early days of Chris Reeve Knives, considered custom knives, this is no longer true.\u00a0 The demand for our products has enabled us to change the way we make our knives and to make use of modern computer controlled equipment.\u00a0 We have been able to increase the number of knives we make, keep the quality high and the prices at a realistic level.\u00a0 What sets our knives in their own category of excellence is that every blade is free-hand ground, every folding knife is individually fitted, and every knife sharpened by hand.\u00a0 Our knives are not true production pieces; they are hand made individual pieces with limited room for custom work.\nInlaid or Overlaid?\nWe offer three different styles of folders with wood or mammoth inlaid into the handle: The Annual Limited Edition Sebenza , the Classic Wood Inlay Sebenza and the Mnandi .\u00a0 The shapes are different for all these knives but the premise is the same \u0096 a pocket is machined into the handle and the wood or mammoth is inlaid into that pocket.\u00a0 The inlay is held in position by VHB double sided tape and the very close tolerance to which the pieces are machined.\u00a0 This technique results in a superior product, one that lasts far longer than one where the wood section was simply overlaid onto the titanium.\u00a0 Please see more detail here About Inlays .\nLeather vs Kydex Sheaths\nThere are pros and cons for both types of sheaths but we have chosen to stay with leather as the standard sheath material for our fixed blade knives.\u00a0 However, there are many companies that make good after-market Kydex sheaths.\u00a0 Two that we have worked with and know how to make good products are:\nBob Dozier\n"}, {"score": 872.4531, "uuid": "25de8070-e63c-5735-914c-3c8aa7d8fa48", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0105wb-43-30031", "target_hostname": "www.cooks-knives.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.cooks-knives.co.uk/acatalog/FAQs.html", "page_rank": 4.3121386e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "FAQs - Cooks <em>Knives</em>", "snippet": "These instructions <em>should</em> be included in your original order <em>or</em> advised to us prior to dispatch by telephone.

Smith, Mississauga, ON, Dec. 2009\nNow that I've lived with my Misono Swedish Steel gyutou for a few months - and given myself a proper cut with it - I'm ready to venture an opinion.\nI should start with a disclaimer, though: I haven't compared it with hundreds of other knives. It would be interesting, in particular, to live with this knife and the UX-10 for a few months, to see what differences appear. Also, I'm using this knife at home. I'm not a working prep-cook, so my knives don't get truly heavy use. That said, it's really a great knife.\nFit, finish, sharpness\nBuying a knife because it's sharp is like buying a case of wine because it's cold. Still, the knife arrived admirably sharp. I can find no fault with the fit of the handle or rivets.\nDesign\nThe handle is a little larger than most, which I find that I like quite a bit. the knife is comfortable and very well balanced. (If you pinch it at the base of the blade, it balances exactly). It took a little while to get used to the asymmetrical bevel of the cutting edge. The knife does steer a little -- I'll reduce this over the next few years of sharpening.\nI like the absence of a full bolster: they only get in the way when you're sharpening, and in a few years, you wind up with a blade with an arch near the heel.\nPerformance\nOf course, the only reason to buy a non-stainless knife is for its steel. This is indeed great knife steel. Some reviews of the Swedish Steel line have commented that the steel is highly reactive. This is not true. It's picking up a bit of patina now, but this steel is not nearly as reactive as the pure carbon steel in my older knives. In fact I suspect, on the strength of this observation, that there's a little chromium in the alloy. Chromium is what makes stainless steel stainless, and if it's really important to you that your knives be pretty, then chromium is what you want. The down-side of chromium is that it greatly increases the tendency of steel to work-harden, that is, to get harder and stronger when deformed. Most stainless steels actually need specialized machining techniques, because work-hardening leads to excessive wear of the tools used to cut it. In a knife, the effect is to make it much harder to restore an edge. The sharper (and therefore more fragile at the edge) you like to keep your knives, the worse this gets. It is quite literally true that I spend more time maintaining the edge on a little Global stainless steel 3\" paring knife than on any other knife on my rack. The good news is that what little chromium (I suspect) there is in the Swedish steel does nothing to impair its sharpening performance. Lightly honing on a ceramic steel and finishing on a barber's strop (loaded with green paste metal-polishing compound) is all that's needed to keep the gyutou razor-sharp for weeks on end, at least in a home kitchen. Since I check this every now and then, I look like my forearms have the mange -- little bald patches here and there.\nSharpening on 1000/4000 grit Japanese water stones is a breeze. the burr lets go just as easily as on an antique Sabatier, leaving an edge that would do a scalpel proud.\nI guess you do need to be a bit of a knife nut to want a carbon steel chef's knife. But if you're already spending any amount of time on the stones, trying to keep your knives really sharp, then you'll likely find that the Misono rewards your efforts much more fully than a stainless knife.\nCategories\n"}, {"score": 788.54047, "uuid": "5426a25c-e911-5ad3-ac47-56197c51c042", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0004wb-91-13877", "target_hostname": "housewares.about.com", "target_uri": "http://housewares.about.com/od/knifereviews/fr/foreversharpknives.htm", "page_rank": 1.2229586e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Forever Sharp <em>Knives</em> - Forever Sharp 8-Pc Knife Set Review", "snippet": "<em>I</em> purchased a few months ago at Sam&#x27;s a set of Forever Sharp <em>knives</em> (6 <em>knives</em> and 2 juicers plus 2 sets of steak <em>knives</em>.

The set includes three same-size long serrated knives (called the Forever Sharp Knife) which would be a waste unless you wanted to share with family, which is what I did. Blades are extremely thin and although during the demonstration the Forever Knife easily sliced through frozen foods, this knife is just too thin and flexible for this application. Rather than persisting to where the blade would snap, I gave up trying to slice through frozen or very hard foods.\nI found the best use for the Forever Knife is for slicing bread evenly. Though you can slice tomatoes cleanly with it, this knife is rather long for this use. The serrated blade is not good for chopping or carving meat or poultry, so its use is rather limited. The filet knife's thin construction worked very well for deboning, for very thin slices of tomatoes, and for slicing and carving. The filet knife is actually the most versatile knife from this set. Paring knives are also sharp and worked well for small cutting tasks.\nThe blades of all these knives are extremely sharp. To reduce the risk of injury, knives should be stored in the cardboard sleeves they came in. Other than mild spotting; the blade finish is holding up well. These knives are not dishwasher-safe which is fine, because they're so sharp and thin, it's safer to wash them by hand. Handles are a resin composition, reasonably comfortable and non-slip unless wet.\nOverall Impression\nI found advertising these knives as a set - a little misleading. Unless you intend to share part of this set with others, why would anyone want three of the same size and type of knife, unless you wanted to keep two for back-up. Although the price of the set seemed reasonable at the time, their use is limited by the thinness of the blades. The Forever Sharp Knife is too thin to safely cut through many hard foods including watermelon or cantaloupe. However, I do love slicing bread with this knife and the Filet knife is handy for slicing tomatoes, cooked meats, boning and many other uses.\nAs for durability, serrated blades though not impossible to sharpen, are very difficult even for an experienced person. The length and thinness of the blades makes them very flimsy and more susceptible to breakage. They are however, very sharp and are holding their edge.\nThe bottom line: If you're sharing - it's a good deal, otherwise their use is rather limited.\nRead Related Knife Articles\n"}, {"score": 745.11755, "uuid": "b0187b1e-028a-5a93-91d4-ea89f4c39563", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0505wb-88-20397", "target_hostname": "www.discusscooking.com", "target_uri": "http://www.discusscooking.com/forums/f90/what-knives-are-the-best-70889-2.html", "page_rank": 1.1883284e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "What <em>knives</em> are the best? - Page 2 - Discuss Cooking - Cooking Forums", "snippet": "The part about the folding <em>steel</em> <em>or</em> doing it so well, makes a knife with good retention, in general isn&#x27;t true.

My brother has a knife branded by Edward Don that looks exactly like the Sanelli right down to the two-tone coloration except that it's gray with red accents. It's impossible to sharpen the very heel, either on stones or belts.\nI know some people like them but I'd give them a wide berth.

The knife is made of 440 steel hardened to 52-54 R. 440 is not the best grade of steel, and 52 is pretty soft. I don't see a 52 R steel holding an edge for any length of time. VG 10 is typically hardened to 60 or better. The 45 degree bolster would get in the way when using the knife to its outer limits of length, i.e halving a melon, and a with the bolster shape and materiel, would be difficult to sharpen without damaging the bolster. The cutting edge runs to the bolster. You either like the design or you don't. I don't. The site advertises the green color as being easier to see on the cutting surface. Not sure that would make a difference. A stainless blade with a black handle is pretty visible, and it is not a good idea to leave knives laying around anyway.\nAll in all, for my purposes and for the price, I think you would be better off with a commercial grade Forschner or Dexter, or a German Henkels or Wusthoff, or for a little more, a Japanese VG 10 blade.\n__________________\nPosts: 3\ncheck these\nColtellerie Sanelli S.p.A. created its Premana Professional collection by analysing and solving every last one of the problems that are encountered by the professional who uses these working tools every day. In short, these are the salient properties of the Premana Professional collection:\nBLADES\nEdge shape especially designed for professional use.\nExcellent sharpening potential.\nThe convex shape of the edge guarantees an efficient support when the user has to exert considerable force. The edge is not subject to chipping.\nHANDLES\nThe exclusive ergonomic handle design is the result of special studies carried out at qualified University Institutes (a research unit named EPM: Ergonomics of Posture and Movement at the Milan Polytechnic) and tested by computerized experimental tests.\nThe ergonomic shape brings a sharp reduction in user fatigue.\nThe soft, but slightly rough surface makes the handle non-slip and much safer to use.\nThe material used is non-toxic and complies with the European rules.\nThe material used will resist sudden temperature changes (from -40\u00b0C to +150\u00b0C), corrosive agents and detergents.\nThis means that the knife can be cleaned in a dishwasher and sterilized.\nThe handle is perfectly balanced with the blade.\nThe handle\u0092s green colour makes the knife immediately visible on the work bench: greater safety at work. The shape of the handle was designed at the computer.\nBy creating the Premana Professional collection, the aim of Coltellerie Sanelli S.p.A. is to make a decisive contribution to improving safety, reliability and hygiene at work. No other collection of professional cutlery currently available has all these properties. The Premana Professional collection knives are covered by European and U.S. patents.\n__________________\nQuote:\nOriginally Posted by jaybett\nThis criticism can be made for most western knives, because of the bolster.

Well, my normal recommendation it to get a Japanese knife, that's wafer thin with no bolster!\nBut until you've seen that knife I don't thing you really \"get\" just how fat the handle is. All \"traditional\" Euro-style knives with a bolster are fatally flawed re sharpening the 1/4\" in front of the bolster. But the Sanellis (unless the newer ones are different) it's almost impossible to the last 1/2\" of the heel. We're talking almost 1\" thick vs the 1/4\" that you can't effectively sharpen on a traditional German boat anchor. Obviously you're better off letting the Germans build your car and the Japanese build your knives. But if you have to cut corners you can at least get the best of an inferior breed.\nIf you're not willing to get serious than a Forschner Fibrox might be your best bet.\nIf you're a little bit more serious than most, but don't want to spend enough to get a Japanese knife, get a Sab. But be advised that many companies use the name...\n__________________\nIf we're not supposed to eat animals, then how come they're made out of meat?\n04-13-2011, 09:08 PM\nJoin Date: Jun 2010\nPosts: 141\nI received a Shun classic hg with vg10 clad steel last christmas.

They also said to make sure you bring it to a professional sharpener who can put a perfect 16 degree edge on it. I believe there are also sharpeners you can buy to make the same angle.

I believe there are also sharpeners you can buy to make the same angle. I've used it for 4 months now, and it is still amazingly sharp.\nThe part about the folding steel or doing it so well, makes a knife with good retention, in general isn't true.\nThe steel in Japanese knives is harder then those typically found in European knives. Harder means brittle. A hard knife, made out of steel or ceramic will chip. To compensate makers will sandwich or clad the hard steel, between soft steel. The edge can still chip, but the knife won't break, like a ceramic.\nDepending on the properties knife makers value, will effect their choice of steel and how they work with it. Shun values a sharp knife that will hold its edge a long time.\nKnives that have good wear resistance, in general are more difficult to sharpen. Additionally the cladding on a Shun is very soft and will easily scratch.\nThe Edge Pro is a nice system, if you have a number of knives to sharpen. If you only have the Shun, then sending it out, makes more sense. Just make sure whoever you send the knife to, is familiar with Japanese steel and Shuns.\nJay\n"}, {"score": 727.11835, "uuid": "0d0b9012-63cd-51e8-9f1f-5e5b214e8c36", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1312wb-85-06224", "target_hostname": "www.gourmetretailer.com", "target_uri": "http://www.gourmetretailer.com/article-knives__a_cut_above-1279.html", "page_rank": 1.1776213e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>Knives</em>: A Cut Above - Features - Gourmet Retailer Magazine | Gourmet Retailers", "snippet": "&quot;<em>I</em> also teach how to <em>buy</em> a knife and what are the essentials, and where do you go from there.&quot; Sarah Jay, who penned &quot;<em>Knives</em> Cooks Love,&quot; says there&#x27;s a big misconception retailers <em>should</em> address: Many home chefs incorrectly believe a honing <em>steel</em> can sharpen dull <em>knives</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nBy Anna Wolfe\nBy selling quality knives, independent retailers can carve out a niche market, offering a quality selection and focusing on service.\nRetailer Perspective\nDemystifying knives \u2014 the styles, the materials, how to care for them and how to use them safely \u2014 can help independent retailers carve out a niche market, says Art Nading, co-owner of The Extra Ingredient in Greensboro, N.C.\nMartha and Art Nading celebrate their gourmet store's 25th anniversary this month with in-store events, including a knife sharpening event.\n\"People are intimidated by knives,\" Nading says. \"Our customers come in, and we help them feel not so intimidated.\"\nKnives have been part of The Extra Ingredient's selection since Art and Martha Nading opened the kitchenware store 25 years ago. Today, their offerings include knives from Shun, Zwilling J.A Henckels, Forschner, Victorinox, W\u00fcsthof, Kyocera, Messermeister, Meridian Elite and Global. Plus, the store carries honing stones, diamond ceramic steels and Chef's Choice electric knife sharpeners. The impressive selection \u2014 combined with the service and education it offers \u2014 has established the gourmet retailer as the area's go-to store for high-end knives.\nThe Nadings and their staff, many of whom have been with the store for more than 15 years, focus on personal service, which includes pairing home cooks with the knives that best suit their needs.\n\"Choosing a knife is very subjective,\" Nading says. \"It has got to feel right in those people's hands.\"\nFor cooks who have more of a cleaver style of chopping, The Extra Ingredient may suggest a santoku; for cooks with a classic, rocking style of cutting, it may recommend a traditional chef's knife. Recently, a customer came in looking for a \"long paring knife\" and went home with what she actually needed, which happened to be a boning knife.\n\"I don't think there is a \u2018have to' in ownership of knives,\" Nading says. \"We try to match knives to that person, and people like that.\"\nThe majority of The Extra Ingredient's knife sales are from individual knives.\n\"We sell knife sets when someone wants to throw everything out and start over,\" he adds.\nThe Extra Ingredient sells a lot of traditional chef's knives, in 6- and 8-inch lengths. Some people are adding special knives, such as a sashimi knife, to their collections as they explore Asian cooking. More and more, the retailer is selling Japanese-style knives such as the santoku, the Japanese chef knife, nakiri and the Japanese vegetable knife as well as the sashimi knife \u2014 a long, thin knife for filleting fish.\nOverall, knives are a \"must-have\" category for gourmet retailers, Nading says.\n\"The nice thing about knives and cutlery is that it does require a lot of one-on-one attention,\" he explains. \"This is a great category for us because of the service it requires. It helps small stores like ours compete.\"\nInvesting in Quality\nWith the downturn in the economy, consumers have been eating out less, returning to their kitchens and cooking more meals at home. For gourmet retailers such as The Extra Ingredient, this has been an opportunity to sell the necessary tools and teach skills.\n\"People are cooking a lot more today,\" Nading says. \"It's a good way to save money, watch your diet and eat healthier. It's more than a trend, it's a true lifestyle.\"\nConsumers may be pinching pennies, but when it comes to knives, The Extra Ingredient's clientele isn't cutting corners. They see value in making an investment in quality knives that will last for years.\n\"In this economy, people want to buy top quality and something that lasts forever, and they want to know how they can they maintain it,\" Nading says.\nOffering in-store events, such as knife skills and knife sharpening, not only helps educate the customers, but also drive traffic to the store \u2014 and increase sales.\n\"We've always had knife clinics and knife skills events, and they're becoming more and more popular,\" Nading says.\nRecently, customers came in to see Amy Schroeder, sales manager for Zwilling J.A. Henckels, teach a knife skills and techniques class. To celebrate their 25 years in business, the Nadings also hosted several in-store events, including a Wusthof cutlery knife sharpening on Oct. 9.\n\"Product demos help our whole knife business,\" he says.\nBooks\nIn his store, Nading doesn't carry any knife skills books. Like many gourmet retailers, he's cut back his cookbook selection because of the popularity of Amazon.com.\n\"Our customers haven't asked for books,\" he says. \"They want to be shown.\"\nSeveral reference books are available that illustrate knife skills. Even if you don't sell them in your store, these highly illustrated guides would be a great resource and training aid to have on hand. The new \"Zwilling J.A. Henckels Complete Book of Knife Skills\" by Jeffrey Elliot and James P. DeWan (published October 2010 by Robert Rose, spiral bound hardcover $34.95) and \"Knives Cooks Love\" by Sur La Table and Sarah Jay (published October 2008 Andrews MacMeel, hardcover $25.) both cover the different style of knives, knife care and various knife skills techniques. \"Knives Cooks Love\" also features some recipes that put the reader's knife skills to work. The spiral-bound feature on the Zwilling book is a nice touch, as many home cooks would like to easily view the pictures while following the step-by-step pictures.\nNew Products\nKuhn Rikon Flexi Knife Spatula\nKuhn Rikon, Novato, Calif., introduces the Flexi Knife Spatula Colori, designed to cut and scoop.\nThis two-in-one tool cuts like a knife: the nonstick blade is perfect for chopping or mincing. Its opposite side works like a spatula to scoop up ingredients.

Profession features square rivets and straight lines, while Perfection has more flowing lines.\nBoth lines feature blades forged from a single piece of special corrosion-resistant X50CrMoV15 chromium molybdenum vanadium steel and non-slip injection-molded plastic/fiberglass handles for a secure grip that's also ergonomic. Accessories and two sharpening steels, a beechwood cutting board and two knife blocks for storage are part of the lines.\nThe minimum advertised price range for the Perfection line's open stock items range from $65 to $125, while the 7-piece block set has a MAP of $580. The MAP range for the Profession line open stock is $60-140, with two sets available: a 4-piece magnetic block set with Japanese knives for $500 and a 5-piece magnetic block set with traditional European knives for $490.\nFor more information, call 888-FISSLER or visit www.fisslerusa.com .\nTraining Tips\nJeffrey Elliot, director of culinary relations for Zwilling J.A. Henckels LLC, says The Extra Ingredient and other Gourmet Catalog member stores do an excellent job of teaching knife skills.\nElliot, who co-authored the new book \"Zwilling J.A. Henckels Complete Book of Knife Skills,\" offers his top training tips.\nWhen training staff on selling knives, Elliot says to focus on the:\nDifferent types of knives\nDifferent types of steels\nWhy some knives cost more than others. (Hint, it's the materials, especially the steel. Better steel is sharper out of the box and stays sharper longer.)\nThe differences between German and Japanese knives (materials, manufacturing, philosophies behind, uses), and why in a Western kitchen it's not a question of having one or the other, but an explanation of why you need both.\n\"For consumers, the same lessons apply, but what I focus on in consumer knife skills are safety, how to hold a knife, how to move the knife in a slicing or rocking motion and in the chopping motion, and what to do with your guide hand,\" Elliot says. \"I also teach how to buy a knife and what are the essentials, and where do you go from there.\"\nSarah Jay, who penned \"Knives Cooks Love,\" says there's a big misconception retailers should address: Many home chefs incorrectly believe a honing steel can sharpen dull knives.\n\"Using a sharpening steel won't bring back a truly dull knife,\" Jay says. \"At that point, you have to use something to remove steel or take it somewhere to have it sharpened.\"\nProper knife storage is another opportunity for retailers, she adds. From sheaths, to magnetic bars to blocks to drawer inserts, many storage systems are on the market and can be paired with a customer's needs \u2014 for safety and to maintain the quality of the knife.\n\"Once their customers have spent a little money on knives, make sure they're being stored properly,\" Jay notes.\nNew Product Spotlight\nKing Arthur Flour Gluten-Free Yellow Cake Mix\nKing Arthur Flour, based in Norwich, Vt., has expanded its line of premium gluten-free baking mixes with a Gluten-Free Yellow Cake Mix.\nFeatured Videos\n"}, {"score": 727.0006, "uuid": "25afc053-fb6a-5659-a740-afa653ed2efd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0907wb-16-22796", "target_hostname": "equipped.com", "target_uri": "http://equipped.com/shot_show_2004_knives.htm", "page_rank": 1.1970541e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "SHOT Show 2004 Report - <em>Knives</em> - EQUIPPED TO SURVIVE", "snippet": "It is hardly all-encompassing, many new <em>knives</em> are too wild and impractical to meet my criteria for a functional and practical wilderness survival knife.

With a few exceptions, all had lots of new sharp edges with points to get excited about. However, more often than in prior years, I was shown prototypes but then asked not to write about them. Many manufacturers are holding their cards close until they are nearly ready for production as they fear knock-offs and competitive moves that can develop these days in much less time than used to be the case. Technology has significantly shortened development time when it's not creativity and innovation that is required.\nThis is a very personal report on SHOT Show. What follows are just the highlights from the show that caught my eye. It is hardly all-encompassing, many new knives are too wild and impractical to meet my criteria for a functional and practical wilderness survival knife. For the most part, I have not included tactical or martial arts knives. Also not covered, with a few exceptions that tickled my fancy and which also were reasonably practical, are fancy knives designed primarily to look good or impressive. Due to press of time and various critical time-sensitive projects under way, this review is somewhat shorter than usual. I have not spent time or effort, for the most part, on the more trivial stuff and minor things like new finishes to old products. I appreciate your understanding.\nUnlike years past, I have relied upon the manufacturers for much of the photography. We'll see how that works. It certainly made for a much more enjoyable show for me; I had time to actually have a conversation in many of the booths. My wife joined me for the first time and that also helped to encourage me to take it a little easier and to have some fun and to introduce her to my many friends at the show that I generally only see once or twice a year.\nAssisted opening folders were again popular. Virtually everyone who didn't have one yet, finally succumbed, those that had them introduced variations and line extensions. For the uninitiated, we'll repeat our brief overview on the subject: By \"assisted opening\" we are talking about a spring-powered mechanism that opens the knife once you have started opening the blade. This is differentiated from an automatic (commonly referred to as a switchblade) that opens with just the press of a button or lever or by gravity alone. Some argue it is a distinction without a difference and many fear that assisted opening knives are a potential legal minefield, but for now they are legal in most places and the feds haven't made an issue of it. Mind you, laws against automatic knives are bogus anyway and were enacted in a moment of political hysteria, but that's another issue.\nIn most, but not all cases the spring takes over almost immediately after you start opening the blade, thus for safety's sake in such designs you really need to lock it closed and such knives are equipped with safety locks, which often pretty much defeats much of the supposed advantage the mechanism might provide. Forgetting to lock the safety can result in an assisted opening folder opening in your pocket, with resulting damage to your person or your clothing (been there, done that!). The alternative, which a few manufacturers have implemented, and which we prefer, is to ensure the assist doesn't start until the blade is opened manually a considerable ways.\nIt seems that the traditional drop point blade shape, our favorite, is continuing to make something of a comeback, though nobody had any explanation as to why, other than it's a shape that works. Perhaps it's just one of those everything-old-is-new-again sort of things.\nWe have provided the specifications we received from the manufacturers for the most part; some are much better than others in what they provide, so blame them if you are missing some spec you'd have liked to have seen.\nPrices quoted are manufacturer's suggested retail price as of February, 2004 (we don't waste pixels, or your intelligence, on 95 cents, we just round up). Most gear covered here can be purchased at significantly discounted prices from those quoted.\nAssembling this SHOT Show Report is a major undertaking for this one-man show.

The existing line of U.S. production knives have been renamed as the Blue Class or, for tactical, Black Class and their specials are now the Gold Class.\nThe Mel Pardue designed Model 10505 RANT DPT ($60) is a traditional drop point hunter with a 4.5 inch blade of N690 stainless. This is an Austrian made stainless steel that is supposed to be equivalent to 440C.\nThere is a stainless bolster and butt cap. Benchmade's \"BILT System\" (Blade Inline Tang) incorporates a long nut inside a slot in the full tang, then the butt is secured with a through bolt that is tightened down to lock the polypropylene handle with black Krayton overmold in place.\u00a0 If desired, it can be disassembled for cleaning.\u00a0\u00a0 The nylon sheath has a plastic insert and there's a cross strap with metal snap to retain the knife securely in the sheath. The only real complaint I can make, at first glance, is the lack of a lanyard hole.\u00a0 A bowie version (Model 10500) with molded leather sheath is also available.\nThe Red Class Model 10300 Monochrome ($50) is a Steirer Eisen designed, integral lock folder with stainless handles and a 3-inch N690 drop point blade.\u00a0 It has dual thumb lugs, but the removable pocket clip is right hand only. There's a lanyard hole in the butt and lots of ridges all over the top and bottom for a secure grip. The lock-up felt solid and there's little to indicate it's anything other than the sort of product you'd expect from Benchmade.\nBack to the Blue Class, one of the more strikingly pretty, but still functional new knives is the Model 960 ($200) designed by Warren Osborne.\u00a0 This was originally a limited production design, what would now be called Gold Class, that has been put into production.\u00a0 The detailing is very nice for such a practical knife. It builds on the ergonomic handles of the Switchback, minus the second piggyback knife blade and with a rounded butt.\u00a0 The handles are anodized red aluminum with black G10 inlays.\nThe 3.12 (9.92 cm) \"modified drop point,\" very nearly a spear point, plain edge blade is of D2 steel. The lock is AXIS retained by stainless steel liners. The thumbs studs and pocket clip are ambidextrous. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a lanyard hole.\nAnother practical and functional beauty is the Model 670 Apparition ($140), a Mel Pardue and Warren Osborne collaboration and the first assisted opening knife from Benchmade. The assisted opening mechanism is a new, patented design given the moniker \"Optimiser\" and it has a couple interesting tricks up its sleeve. Most innovative is that the assisted opening function is optional, the user can add it or remove it as desired. Given the legal cloud that's hanging over assisted opening knives in some areas, that could be a mighty useful capability.\nWithout it, the knife is just another one-hand opening liner lock, but add the Optimzer spring rod and it provides the necessary tension for the assist.\u00a0 One of the features we like about this opening assist is that it doesn't become effective until the blade is opened 30 degrees.\u00a0 This eliminates the need for a separate safety and as we have noted before, we prefer this sort of action for assisted opening knives.\nThe 670 features polished stainless steel bolsters and molded imitation kudu horn scales. The back spacer has ersatz file work and the ambidextrous pocket clip is polished. The 3.4-inch (8.64 cm) drop point blade is of 154CM stainless with a plain edge riding between titanium liners. There are dual thumb studs.\nThe Mike Snody designed Model 210 Activator ($140) is a compact drop point full tang fixed blade utility knife.\u00a0 The 2.5-inch (6.35 cm) drop point blade has a high grind.\u00a0 The sculpted three-inch handles with carbon fiber and G10 bolster and scales is both functional and sharp looking. There's a deep finger recess for safety and the spine is ridged for secure thumb purchase.\u00a0 They didn't forget a lanyard hole.\u00a0 It's one of those rare small blades that fits a large hand comfortably.\u00a0 The friction fit sheath is textured black leather and it is designed to slip into a deep pocket.\nBoker\nBoker added the Lamda 189 ($180) to complement last year's small Zeta with a 3-inch Cera-Titan sintered titanium drop point blade. The is a right-handed thumb lug, a plastic half disc actually.\u00a0 The handle is the same Zytel with Kraton insert as used on the Gemini series.\u00a0 It has a pronounced finger guard and an inset stainless steel liner lock with a fixed stainless right-handed pocket clip and a lanyard hole.\nThe Cera-Titan blade is 40% lighter than steel, the whole knife weighs in at 2.7 ounces, and Boker claims it retains an edge very nearly as well as ceramic, which would be very well indeed.\u00a0 Unlike ceramic, if necessary it can be sharpened using normal sharpeners and it is flexible, thus more tolerant of abuse.\nThe Dietmar Pohl designed KAL/KALS 74 series ($33 - $35) in Boker's Magnum line is said to be influenced by the bayonet of the AK-47. They must be talking about the handle, because blade shape itself is a practical modified drop point, something no self-respecting AK-47 ever got close to.\u00a0 Both knives share ergonomic aluminum handles with pronounced finger grooves, ridges on the butt and top fore end and a lanyard hole with a small Kalashnikov medallion inset. The KAL version has a slightly recurved AUS 8 stainless 3.5-inch blade with a thumb stud and stainless liner lock.\u00a0 The KALS has a more traditional drop point style, no thumb opener, and Magnum's pushbutton lock.\nBoker also showed us a sample of a new line of Opinel influenced knives they will be soon be selling. The sample was of a double locking bladed knife, clip point plain edge and blunt tip serrated, with a molded handle and the usual twist style locking mechanism.\u00a0 For those who like the Opinel design, but have despaired of ever seeing anything in modern materials or more innovative designs in that vein, these may well prove to be what they had hoped for.\nBuck Knives\nThe Crosslock is back at Buck Knives , the latest iteration being called the Model 183 Alpha Crosslock PBS.\u00a0 The \"PBS\" stands for Portable Butcher Shop, so it's easy to see what market this knife is aimed at. We always liked to Crosslock design for its two full sized locking blades, but the notable drawback was the lack of any finger guard and weight was also an issue.\u00a0 Buck has addressed both issues with this latest evolution.\nThe blades incorporate a flipper style opener that becomes a finger guard when the blade is opened ; the handles are machined anodized aluminum (black or camo ) with a series of five lightening holes and the whole knife now weighs in at only 4 ounces (113 gr). The pocket clip is ambidextrous and there's a lanyard hole at the top of the butt.\u00a0 While the thumbs studs are set up for right-handed use, the flippers serve to make the blade opening ambidextrous as well . For those who carry in the provided nylon sheath, they also make it easier to grasp and pull from the sheath.\nThe primary blade is a 3-inch (7.6 cm) modified spear point, very nearly a drop point, with a cut-out on the spine, in 420HC stainless. The other blade is an aggressive crosscut saw with a gut hook on its spine. We're pleased to see the Crosslock back with these better features and hope that Buck will produce additional versions with more blade options, as they did before.\nThe Model 290/291 Rush ($73 / $90) is Buck's first assisted opening knife and it incorporates a number of unique features. The skeletonized handle is possible because the assisted opening mechanism is powered by dual coil spring at the fore end around the pivot, what Buck is calling \"ASAP\" for Advanced Spring Assisted Performance.\u00a0 It incorporates a flipper for quick opening, as well as ambidextrous thumb studs. Another innovation is the Cam Lock Safety, which is located immediately behind the flipper on the top of the knife. The lock is a lever that is easily engaged or disengaged with the same finger used to open the blade, making it far less of a hassle than other locks we have experienced to date.\u00a0 We prefer designs that make such locks unnecessary, but if it needs a lock, it should be as convenient to use as possible and this appears to do just that.\nThe two models are identical in other details except that the 291 has an ATS-34 stainless blade while the 290 is 420HC.\u00a0 Handles are anodized aluminum with a 2.5-inch (6.4 cm) drop point blade.\u00a0 The liners and liner lock are stainless. The pocket clip is removable, but not ambidextrous and there's no lanyard hole.\nColumbia River Knife & Tool\nColumbia River Knife & Tool's Convergence folder ($70) is a slim clip point knife that we normally wouldn't make much note of due to its blade shape, but it caught our attention for its unique (patented) \"RealEase\" ambidextrous liner lock release invented by custom makers Charles Kain of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Steve McCowen of Iola, Wisconsin. This is another of those deceptively simple mechanisms that leaves you shaking your head.\nThe \"button\" is located between the frame sides on the bottom of the knife at the fore end. When you pull the release back, using pretty minimal pressure from either index finger, the sloped face of the lock release moves the liner sideways, wedging the liner open and releasing the blade.\u00a0 It's almost too easy for a tactical knife, but we anticipate we'll see a good deal more of this mechanism going forward.\nThe Van Hoy R.S.L. Snap Lock ($50) is another unique offering, worthy of mention if for no other reason than virtually everyone we showed our sample to thought it was cool. The Rotating Snap Lock takes some practice to get used to it and to do it quickly without much thought. Pushing the top sideways spreads the stainless side pieces that form the handle apart allowing the blade to pivot on its pins until it locks in place again. The tighter you squeeze the handle, the more secure the blade is held. Release is just the same; push the lock to the side spreading the handle and the blade can be rotated back.\nVan explained that the knife is designed to ride next to the seam in a pair of blue jeans. Due to its design, the ambidextrous pocket clip requires a different clip depending on what side you wear it on; both clips will be included. Remove the clip and it is fully ambidexterous. The lock also serves as a quick release; wearing it as a neck knife is a viable option.\nThe AUS 6M blade is 2.5 inches long and the warncliff style is reasonably practical.\nKit Carson's new M21 series is based on his popular M16 and M18 designs.\u00a0 It features the trademark open skeletonized handles from the M16, this time in hard anodized 6061 T6 aluminum, no scales, and the robust recurved spearpoint blade design of the M18.\nThe blade is AUS 8 with a frosted finish.\u00a0 It incorporates Kit's \"flipper\" that forms a true finger guard when the blade is locked in place by the integral liner lock. There's CRK&T's LAWKS lock to prevent inadvertent release of the liner lock. The removable stainless pocket clip is not ambidextrous.\nGerber\nThe success of the Gerber's Freeman Fixed Blade (nee \"Hunter\") introduced last year, one of the nicer affordable practical drop point\u00a0 \"hunters\" around, prompted an explosive extension of the line this year from Gerber. The Freeman Folder ($60) has a 3.25 inch drop point blade of 440A stainless steel.\u00a0 Stainless liners and liner lock are covered in pear wood scales.\u00a0 I has ambidextrous thumb studs for opening, a good finger guard and thumb rest, but no pocket clip. It comes with the traditional Gerber nylon sheath which can be carried horizontally or vertically.\nThe Freeman Exchange-A-Blade ($100) is a fixed blade with two sets of multiple blade options. Both versions come with a drop point and saw blade.\u00a0 One comes with a gut hook, the other with a boning blade. The blades slip in the fore end and a push button release on the side of the bolster releases the blade to exchange it. A nylon sheath with pocket for the alternate blades is included.\nA Freeman Caping Knife ($40) is also offered, a fixed drop point 2.5-inch blade.\u00a0 It lacks the lanyard slot of the other Freeman knives, but includes the pear wood scales over the full tang. A molded nylon sheath is provided.\nThe Nautilus ($60) is Gerber's entry this year into the tool wars.\u00a0 This is not a pliers-equipped multi-purpose tool, more of a tool in the SAK tradition. Its claim to fame is an automatic opening coin-cell powered LED flashlight that flips out from the curved ergonomic handle with a press of a side stud, like a \"switchblade.\"\nThe handle gives a good grip for the light, which has a couple tricks itself.\u00a0 Besides a single white LED on the fore end, like a traditional flashlight; it has a second white LED on the underside . This illuminates the blades and tools in use, allowing the user one-handed operations in the dark.\u00a0 The rubber encased switch on the side of the light cycles it through four modes: fore end light, underside light, both lights and a fore end flashing mode.\u00a0 It would be nice if it also automatically shut off the light when you folded it back into the handle; on a number of occasions we found ourselves leaving the light on.\nThe 2.25-inch spear point one-hand opening blade and the rest of the tools lock in place with the same slide lock arrangement as the Legend. There's also a medium size common screwdriver and cap lifter, a #2 Phillips driver and folding scissors.\u00a0 Somewhat surprisingly, the scissors have no spring; there's a large round ring on the moveable handle that you slip the end of your finger into in order to operate the scissor blades. The scissor blades are only 5/8-inch long.\nThe handle is covered with blue rubber inserts making for a secure grip. Overall length is 4 7/16 closed, it's 7/8 inch thick and it weighs 3.6 ounces.\nThe sheath is molded to fit the curved handle and lies flat, much better than typical envelope style nylon sheaths (similar in concept to Bianchi's excellent AccuMold style sheaths).\u00a0 And, at least on the prototype we were provided, the Gerber trademark square corner that usually drives us nuts was trimmed so that it didn't scratch us every time our arm passed over it.\u00a0 We hope that sort of finishing touch makes it into production, and it would be welcome on all their nylon sheaths. On the down side, it was not easy to grab the Nautilus and pull it from the sheath and on a number of occasions we managed to open squeeze the opening stud for the LED light in the process, which was something of an annoyance.\nGerber also introduced the Gator Combo Axe ($40) with a small drop point fixed blade slipped into the hollow handle of what is, essentially, their diminutive Back Paxe. We've seen this done elsewhere and questioned the practicality, we prefer having our knife always immediately available, but it is space efficient.\u00a0 The pair weigh in at 19.2 ounces with nylon belt sheath.\nOn the other hand, we love the Gator textured rubber applied to the handle.\u00a0 One of the most dangerous attributes of small one-handed hatchets/axes is the smooth handle is just a slip away from disaster.\u00a0 We hope they offer the Gator grip on the other small axes in the line.\u00a0 In the meantime, the Gator Axe will also be available separately ($38).\nKershaw\nThe Ken Onion designed Blur ($90 - $100) from Kershaw is another Speed-Safe assisted opening knife along familiar lines, but with a noticeable difference--no flipper! We were told this is in response to the negative reaction in some quarters to the perceived \"switchblade\" action that the flipper encourages. That aside, the knives present an unmistakable Onion profile with anodized aluminum handles with stylized inserts of what Kershaw is calling Trac-Tec, for added grip. The 3.375 (8.6 cm) 440A stainless blade is a recurved drop point profile. A rescue version is equipped with a blunt rounded tip and a carbide glass breaker in the butt end of the handle. There's a \"tactical\" tanto blade version as well. Liner and liner lock are stainless steel and it is equipped with dual thumb studs.\nThe handles are available in either black or red anodized with black inserts, the latter is both eye appealing and a nice change from the usual black. If dropped, the red is lot's easier to find, a feature we prefer. The pocket clip is reversible and there is a lanyard hole, albeit a bit on the small size.\nThe Bear Hunter II ($40) is an affordable conventional sheath knife with a 4.5-inch (11.4 cm) AUS 8A stainless traditional drop point blade. The co-polymer handles have finger scallops and a large integral single guard. The sheath is black leather.\u00a0 There's no lanyard hole, unfortunately.\nThe Nakamura ($180) incorporates a stunning, if somewhat subtle and subdued, bolster comprised of a total of 19 layers, including 10 layers of stainless steel, 5 layers of\u00a0\u00a0 \"vari-colored\" copper and 4 layers of brass, which are exposed to reveal an intricate pattern. Subtler yet is the layered 2.875 (7.3 cm) modified recurved drop point blade comprised of a VG-10 core clad in a single layer of 420J2 stainless. The bolsters are paired with attractive quince wood handles over the stainless liners and liner lock. The pocket clip is removable.\nLeatherman\nIt was out with the old and in with the new at Leatherman this year as they introduced five all new models, improved and revised the Wave (at $87 it's also priced $7 less than previously) and in the process are replacing all but two of the full-sized portion of their multi-purpose tool line.\u00a0 The Model-T of the multi-purpose tool industry, Leatherman's original Pocket Survival Tool (PST), is gone at the end of 2004. Also history will be the PST II, Pulse, Sideclip and Mini-Tool. The Super Tool 200 and Crunch are the only unchanged holdovers of what is now called the \"Classic\" line. They even introduced a new corporate logo.\nTwo new \"Charge\" models now lead the line-up. The Charge Ti and Charge XTi (both $124) are nearly identical; the \"Ti\" part of their name signifying the new cast and machined titanium handles. The interior frame and liner locks are still stainless steel, only the exterior handles are titanium. The machined surfaces serve to provide a much better grip than the smooth stainless handles of the Wave, a feature I liked a lot.\nThese tools retain the familiar Wave format with two blades, file and saw opening from the exterior and the other tools opening from the interior. The interior tools on both the Wave and the new Charge all lock in place, a welcome addition. The lock release is similar to that used on the Crunch, an easily operated lever. Leatherman claims this lock is double the strength of the blade lock used on the current Pulse model.\nThe saw and file remain the same. The primary plain-edge and serrated blades are more robust, wider and with a larger opening slot allowed by the wider blade. This causes them to protrude a bit more from the body of the tool, but that's a fair tradeoff for easier and safer opening. The added width reduced the chances you will slice your thumb when opening the blade, a drawback of the original blade design, and the additional meat makes for a stronger blade with a bit more metal carried all the way to the tip, a weak point (unintentional pun!) in the previous design.\nBronze bushings have been added to the blade pivots on all the external opening blades to ensure smoother and more consistent opening forces. Spacers between the interior tools now allow them to rotate individually, no more \"clumping.\"\u00a0 The down side is that this wastes space, which impacts either width or tool selection. While I personally never found this to be a major issue, they apparently felt it necessary to respond to competition that has successfully made this a marketing issue.\nWhile the blades on the new Wave remain 420HC stainless, the primary plain edge blade on the Charge is 154 CM, a premium high carbon stainless steel formulation which offers a huge improvement in edge holding. Leatherman claims a three-fold improvement over the 420HC and that wouldn't surprise us. Blade length on all of these is increased slightly to 2.94 inches.\nWe also noticed that on the new Charge the blade aligns such that the handles angle up away from the blade slightly, which is much better than the original Wave where they were in straight alignment. The angle makes them much easier to use to cut close to the bottom of something. (see image to right for comparison on new (top) and old(bottom))\nThe serrated sheepsfoot blade has a more angular tip than the traditional curved tip of the previous blade, but still plenty safe.\u00a0 On the XTi, a cutting hook has been incorporated into the spine of the serrated blade, for use slicing through seatbelts and the like.\u00a0 The top of the serrated blade above the opening hole has some ridges to identify it by feel, no need to use a file to add your own as many of us have done to the original Wave.\nAll the new tools share a new and improved pliers jaw and wire cutter design.\u00a0 The jaws have been beefed up and the area around the pivot joint is now elliptical, reportedly resulting in an overall strength increase of 133%.\u00a0 (see comparison in photo at right of new (top) and old (bottom) style pliers jaws) The attachment of the jaws to the handles has also been beefed up and when closed, there is much less movement of the handles than before, which if nothing else, just feels better and higher quality, even if the functional effect is nil.\nThe length of the wire cutters, including the\u00a0 hard wire cutter at the throat of the pliers, has been increased 58%.\u00a0 The XTi model features a built-in crimper for blasting caps and split shot.\nThe new Charge and Wave incorporate bit holders instead of conventional screwdrivers (with a single exception). There are two sizes.\u00a0 The small one holds a double-ended\u00a0\u00a0.058\" flat diver and a Phillips that Leatherman tells me is between #00 and #000 for the really small stuff like eyeglasses and electronics. The larger takes a multitude of double-ended bits, but not the common 1/4-inch hex bits used by others.\u00a0 These bits have unique flattened hex bodies so they are much slimmer.\u00a0 As a result, at least for now, you'll have to buy extra bits from Leatherman. Leatherman claims the S2 tool steel used is 35% stronger than stainless. They have a zinc phosphate coating for corrosion protection. Leatherman believes the zinc phosphate coating \"is safely characterized as offering a 'high' degree of corrosion protection.\" We'll remain a wee bit skeptical of that until we can test them ourselves.\nThe good news is that the bits take up a lot less room. The flatness of the carrier and bits make for compact storage in a sheath. With all the bits double ended, you also gain there as well. These bits also have double ground common screwdrivers, not the single-ground Leatherman has always used, which is better (Leatherman retains the ground sharp edges to its flat screwdrivers which are much better than the eased edges that you get from polished drivers). The larger multi-fluted drivers and hex drivers, such as the #3 Phillips, are truncated slightly on two sides due to the narrow width of the bits; we'll have to wait until we have samples to determine how well that works.\u00a0 Unlike the Tool Adapter which accept normal 1/4 drive hex adapters, Leatherman doesn't yet make one of its \"flattened-hex\" adapters that will allow you to use a conventional 1/4-inch drive socket. I suspect that it's only a matter of time before someone else does, if Leatherman doesn't.\nFor those who prefer the flexibility of Leatherman's original accommodation for interchangeable 1/4-inch hex bits, their Tool Adapter, and don't mind the extra bulk, the existing version that fits the Wave ($28 including plastic case with belt clip and 6 bits) is also compatible with all the new tools.\nThe Wave and Ti come with a double ended #1/#2 Phillips on one end, a la the current Leatherman combination Phillips bits, and a 3/16\" flat on the other. The XTI has one bit holder with a double-ended #1 and #2 Phillips and adds another bit holder with 1/4\" and 3/16\" common blades.\u00a0 The Wave and Ti also include a fixed large common screwdriver, as of old. Leatherman offers a set of 21 double-ended bits in a pair of convenient holders (click for list) ($20) that slip into a pocket on the tool sheaths. One set of 9 or 10 (respectively and including what's installed in the tool) is included with the Charge Ti and XTi. (click for list)\nThere's also the usual can/bottle opener and on the Wave and Ti, the fold-out scissors, which have been modified.\u00a0 While the blades are shorter, Leatherman claims they cut better and retain sharpness longer. The XTI eliminates the scissors, replacing it with that second bit holder.\nThere's a lanyard ring with a large hole, which is good and an improvement over that of the original Wave, but it cannot be deployed without use of some sort of pointed object to pry it out, which is bad, or at the least, inconvenient.\u00a0 Nor does it lock in place and the sliding design could result in the lanyard being cut if it is collapsed in use, also bad.\u00a0 We suggested a few simple modifications to the prototypes they were showing that would address both issues; we'll have to wait to see if they fix that for production.\nSo, just to review, you can click on each tool that follows for photos of the individual tools opened to show how they are equipped: Wave and Wave interior tools , Charge Ti and Charge XTi\nThe Charge models also come with accessories that are also available separately ($5) and will also fit the Wave, a removable pocket clip and larger, quick-release lanyard ring.\u00a0 There's a slot in the pouch to hold the pocket clip if not attached, and while Leatherman says you can use this same slot to hold the lanyard ring, we're not inclined at first glance to find that very practical as implemented.\nSheaths come in both nylon and leather with elastic side pieces. They will hold the tools both closed and open with the pliers sticking out the bottom. The Charge sheaths include two elastic side pockets that can hold small items such as an ARC AAA light or a knife sharpener.\u00a0 The prototype Charge sheaths we saw had metal logo plates attached, which seems like a bad idea to us.\u00a0 One advantage of a well-designed full sheath is that it prevents the metal knife or tool from scratching stuff your scrape against, like your car, for example. These metal plates seem to be just a scratch waiting to happen.\u00a0 For that matter, the bright yellow logo on the Wave sheaths didn't \u00a0do much for us either. I am sure I wouldn't be the only one cutting those off the nylon sheath and declining the leather one for that reason. I don't mind too much being an unpaid advertising billboard for companies whose products I use, I do mind it when it isn't done tastefully.\nA ruler is included on the handles. Weight of the Charge models is 8.4 and 8.3 ounces (Ti and XTi, respectively), the new Wave weighs in at 8.5 ounces. All are 4 inches in length closed. The Wave is 0.687 inches thick, a hair thinner than the current model; the Charge is 0.75 inches thick.\nThe new Kick ($37), Fuse ($49) and Blast ($62) models will replace the PST, PST II, Pulse and Sideclip and all open in the traditional PST manner. Some basics carry through all three new models. All incorporate the improved pliers as used on the Charge and Wave models. Ergonomic Zytel grip inserts along the edges of the handles provide a much improved and more comfortable grip than the older plain steel edges.\nFuse and Blast have locking tools and blades using the same lever lock used on the interior tools of the Charge and Wave and the tools and blades open independently. The Kick has neither lock nor independently rotating tools and blades. The included lanyard ring is plenty large, no need for a split ring anymore.\u00a0 Blade length on the Fuse and Blast is 2.94 inches; on the Kick it is 2.56 inches.\nA comparison of the three tools (images not to scale):\nKick\n"}, {"score": 726.6689, "uuid": "b5ef3649-ece9-5583-9c1d-de0f89474909", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-42-10708", "target_hostname": "equipped.org", "target_uri": "http://equipped.org/shot_show_2004_knives.htm", "page_rank": 1.1846699e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "SHOT Show 2004 Report - <em>Knives</em> - EQUIPPED TO SURVIVE", "snippet": "It is hardly all-encompassing, many new <em>knives</em> are too wild and impractical to meet my criteria for a functional and practical wilderness survival knife.

With a few exceptions, all had lots of new sharp edges with points to get excited about. However, more often than in prior years, I was shown prototypes but then asked not to write about them. Many manufacturers are holding their cards close until they are nearly ready for production as they fear knock-offs and competitive moves that can develop these days in much less time than used to be the case. Technology has significantly shortened development time when it's not creativity and innovation that is required.\nThis is a very personal report on SHOT Show. What follows are just the highlights from the show that caught my eye. It is hardly all-encompassing, many new knives are too wild and impractical to meet my criteria for a functional and practical wilderness survival knife. For the most part, I have not included tactical or martial arts knives. Also not covered, with a few exceptions that tickled my fancy and which also were reasonably practical, are fancy knives designed primarily to look good or impressive. Due to press of time and various critical time-sensitive projects under way, this review is somewhat shorter than usual. I have not spent time or effort, for the most part, on the more trivial stuff and minor things like new finishes to old products. I appreciate your understanding.\nUnlike years past, I have relied upon the manufacturers for much of the photography. We'll see how that works. It certainly made for a much more enjoyable show for me; I had time to actually have a conversation in many of the booths. My wife joined me for the first time and that also helped to encourage me to take it a little easier and to have some fun and to introduce her to my many friends at the show that I generally only see once or twice a year.\nAssisted opening folders were again popular. Virtually everyone who didn't have one yet, finally succumbed, those that had them introduced variations and line extensions. For the uninitiated, we'll repeat our brief overview on the subject: By \"assisted opening\" we are talking about a spring-powered mechanism that opens the knife once you have started opening the blade. This is differentiated from an automatic (commonly referred to as a switchblade) that opens with just the press of a button or lever or by gravity alone. Some argue it is a distinction without a difference and many fear that assisted opening knives are a potential legal minefield, but for now they are legal in most places and the feds haven't made an issue of it. Mind you, laws against automatic knives are bogus anyway and were enacted in a moment of political hysteria, but that's another issue.\nIn most, but not all cases the spring takes over almost immediately after you start opening the blade, thus for safety's sake in such designs you really need to lock it closed and such knives are equipped with safety locks, which often pretty much defeats much of the supposed advantage the mechanism might provide. Forgetting to lock the safety can result in an assisted opening folder opening in your pocket, with resulting damage to your person or your clothing (been there, done that!). The alternative, which a few manufacturers have implemented, and which we prefer, is to ensure the assist doesn't start until the blade is opened manually a considerable ways.\nIt seems that the traditional drop point blade shape, our favorite, is continuing to make something of a comeback, though nobody had any explanation as to why, other than it's a shape that works. Perhaps it's just one of those everything-old-is-new-again sort of things.\nWe have provided the specifications we received from the manufacturers for the most part; some are much better than others in what they provide, so blame them if you are missing some spec you'd have liked to have seen.\nPrices quoted are manufacturer's suggested retail price as of February, 2004 (we don't waste pixels, or your intelligence, on 95 cents, we just round up). Most gear covered here can be purchased at significantly discounted prices from those quoted.\nAssembling this SHOT Show Report is a major undertaking for this one-man show.

The existing line of U.S. production knives have been renamed as the Blue Class or, for tactical, Black Class and their specials are now the Gold Class.\nThe Mel Pardue designed Model 10505 RANT DPT ($60) is a traditional drop point hunter with a 4.5 inch blade of N690 stainless. This is an Austrian made stainless steel that is supposed to be equivalent to 440C.\nThere is a stainless bolster and butt cap. Benchmade's \"BILT System\" (Blade Inline Tang) incorporates a long nut inside a slot in the full tang, then the butt is secured with a through bolt that is tightened down to lock the polypropylene handle with black Krayton overmold in place.\u00a0 If desired, it can be disassembled for cleaning.\u00a0\u00a0 The nylon sheath has a plastic insert and there's a cross strap with metal snap to retain the knife securely in the sheath. The only real complaint I can make, at first glance, is the lack of a lanyard hole.\u00a0 A bowie version (Model 10500) with molded leather sheath is also available.\nThe Red Class Model 10300 Monochrome ($50) is a Steirer Eisen designed, integral lock folder with stainless handles and a 3-inch N690 drop point blade.\u00a0 It has dual thumb lugs, but the removable pocket clip is right hand only. There's a lanyard hole in the butt and lots of ridges all over the top and bottom for a secure grip. The lock-up felt solid and there's little to indicate it's anything other than the sort of product you'd expect from Benchmade.\nBack to the Blue Class, one of the more strikingly pretty, but still functional new knives is the Model 960 ($200) designed by Warren Osborne.\u00a0 This was originally a limited production design, what would now be called Gold Class, that has been put into production.\u00a0 The detailing is very nice for such a practical knife. It builds on the ergonomic handles of the Switchback, minus the second piggyback knife blade and with a rounded butt.\u00a0 The handles are anodized red aluminum with black G10 inlays.\nThe 3.12 (9.92 cm) \"modified drop point,\" very nearly a spear point, plain edge blade is of D2 steel. The lock is AXIS retained by stainless steel liners. The thumbs studs and pocket clip are ambidextrous. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a lanyard hole.\nAnother practical and functional beauty is the Model 670 Apparition ($140), a Mel Pardue and Warren Osborne collaboration and the first assisted opening knife from Benchmade. The assisted opening mechanism is a new, patented design given the moniker \"Optimiser\" and it has a couple interesting tricks up its sleeve. Most innovative is that the assisted opening function is optional, the user can add it or remove it as desired. Given the legal cloud that's hanging over assisted opening knives in some areas, that could be a mighty useful capability.\nWithout it, the knife is just another one-hand opening liner lock, but add the Optimzer spring rod and it provides the necessary tension for the assist.\u00a0 One of the features we like about this opening assist is that it doesn't become effective until the blade is opened 30 degrees.\u00a0 This eliminates the need for a separate safety and as we have noted before, we prefer this sort of action for assisted opening knives.\nThe 670 features polished stainless steel bolsters and molded imitation kudu horn scales. The back spacer has ersatz file work and the ambidextrous pocket clip is polished. The 3.4-inch (8.64 cm) drop point blade is of 154CM stainless with a plain edge riding between titanium liners. There are dual thumb studs.\nThe Mike Snody designed Model 210 Activator ($140) is a compact drop point full tang fixed blade utility knife.\u00a0 The 2.5-inch (6.35 cm) drop point blade has a high grind.\u00a0 The sculpted three-inch handles with carbon fiber and G10 bolster and scales is both functional and sharp looking. There's a deep finger recess for safety and the spine is ridged for secure thumb purchase.\u00a0 They didn't forget a lanyard hole.\u00a0 It's one of those rare small blades that fits a large hand comfortably.\u00a0 The friction fit sheath is textured black leather and it is designed to slip into a deep pocket.\nBoker\nBoker added the Lamda 189 ($180) to complement last year's small Zeta with a 3-inch Cera-Titan sintered titanium drop point blade. The is a right-handed thumb lug, a plastic half disc actually.\u00a0 The handle is the same Zytel with Kraton insert as used on the Gemini series.\u00a0 It has a pronounced finger guard and an inset stainless steel liner lock with a fixed stainless right-handed pocket clip and a lanyard hole.\nThe Cera-Titan blade is 40% lighter than steel, the whole knife weighs in at 2.7 ounces, and Boker claims it retains an edge very nearly as well as ceramic, which would be very well indeed.\u00a0 Unlike ceramic, if necessary it can be sharpened using normal sharpeners and it is flexible, thus more tolerant of abuse.\nThe Dietmar Pohl designed KAL/KALS 74 series ($33 - $35) in Boker's Magnum line is said to be influenced by the bayonet of the AK-47. They must be talking about the handle, because blade shape itself is a practical modified drop point, something no self-respecting AK-47 ever got close to.\u00a0 Both knives share ergonomic aluminum handles with pronounced finger grooves, ridges on the butt and top fore end and a lanyard hole with a small Kalashnikov medallion inset. The KAL version has a slightly recurved AUS 8 stainless 3.5-inch blade with a thumb stud and stainless liner lock.\u00a0 The KALS has a more traditional drop point style, no thumb opener, and Magnum's pushbutton lock.\nBoker also showed us a sample of a new line of Opinel influenced knives they will be soon be selling. The sample was of a double locking bladed knife, clip point plain edge and blunt tip serrated, with a molded handle and the usual twist style locking mechanism.\u00a0 For those who like the Opinel design, but have despaired of ever seeing anything in modern materials or more innovative designs in that vein, these may well prove to be what they had hoped for.\nBuck Knives\nThe Crosslock is back at Buck Knives , the latest iteration being called the Model 183 Alpha Crosslock PBS.\u00a0 The \"PBS\" stands for Portable Butcher Shop, so it's easy to see what market this knife is aimed at. We always liked to Crosslock design for its two full sized locking blades, but the notable drawback was the lack of any finger guard and weight was also an issue.\u00a0 Buck has addressed both issues with this latest evolution.\nThe blades incorporate a flipper style opener that becomes a finger guard when the blade is opened ; the handles are machined anodized aluminum (black or camo ) with a series of five lightening holes and the whole knife now weighs in at only 4 ounces (113 gr). The pocket clip is ambidextrous and there's a lanyard hole at the top of the butt.\u00a0 While the thumbs studs are set up for right-handed use, the flippers serve to make the blade opening ambidextrous as well . For those who carry in the provided nylon sheath, they also make it easier to grasp and pull from the sheath.\nThe primary blade is a 3-inch (7.6 cm) modified spear point, very nearly a drop point, with a cut-out on the spine, in 420HC stainless. The other blade is an aggressive crosscut saw with a gut hook on its spine. We're pleased to see the Crosslock back with these better features and hope that Buck will produce additional versions with more blade options, as they did before.\nThe Model 290/291 Rush ($73 / $90) is Buck's first assisted opening knife and it incorporates a number of unique features. The skeletonized handle is possible because the assisted opening mechanism is powered by dual coil spring at the fore end around the pivot, what Buck is calling \"ASAP\" for Advanced Spring Assisted Performance.\u00a0 It incorporates a flipper for quick opening, as well as ambidextrous thumb studs. Another innovation is the Cam Lock Safety, which is located immediately behind the flipper on the top of the knife. The lock is a lever that is easily engaged or disengaged with the same finger used to open the blade, making it far less of a hassle than other locks we have experienced to date.\u00a0 We prefer designs that make such locks unnecessary, but if it needs a lock, it should be as convenient to use as possible and this appears to do just that.\nThe two models are identical in other details except that the 291 has an ATS-34 stainless blade while the 290 is 420HC.\u00a0 Handles are anodized aluminum with a 2.5-inch (6.4 cm) drop point blade.\u00a0 The liners and liner lock are stainless. The pocket clip is removable, but not ambidextrous and there's no lanyard hole.\nColumbia River Knife & Tool\nColumbia River Knife & Tool's Convergence folder ($70) is a slim clip point knife that we normally wouldn't make much note of due to its blade shape, but it caught our attention for its unique (patented) \"RealEase\" ambidextrous liner lock release invented by custom makers Charles Kain of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Steve McCowen of Iola, Wisconsin. This is another of those deceptively simple mechanisms that leaves you shaking your head.\nThe \"button\" is located between the frame sides on the bottom of the knife at the fore end. When you pull the release back, using pretty minimal pressure from either index finger, the sloped face of the lock release moves the liner sideways, wedging the liner open and releasing the blade.\u00a0 It's almost too easy for a tactical knife, but we anticipate we'll see a good deal more of this mechanism going forward.\nThe Van Hoy R.S.L. Snap Lock ($50) is another unique offering, worthy of mention if for no other reason than virtually everyone we showed our sample to thought it was cool. The Rotating Snap Lock takes some practice to get used to it and to do it quickly without much thought. Pushing the top sideways spreads the stainless side pieces that form the handle apart allowing the blade to pivot on its pins until it locks in place again. The tighter you squeeze the handle, the more secure the blade is held. Release is just the same; push the lock to the side spreading the handle and the blade can be rotated back.\nVan explained that the knife is designed to ride next to the seam in a pair of blue jeans. Due to its design, the ambidextrous pocket clip requires a different clip depending on what side you wear it on; both clips will be included. Remove the clip and it is fully ambidexterous. The lock also serves as a quick release; wearing it as a neck knife is a viable option.\nThe AUS 6M blade is 2.5 inches long and the warncliff style is reasonably practical.\nKit Carson's new M21 series is based on his popular M16 and M18 designs.\u00a0 It features the trademark open skeletonized handles from the M16, this time in hard anodized 6061 T6 aluminum, no scales, and the robust recurved spearpoint blade design of the M18.\nThe blade is AUS 8 with a frosted finish.\u00a0 It incorporates Kit's \"flipper\" that forms a true finger guard when the blade is locked in place by the integral liner lock. There's CRK&T's LAWKS lock to prevent inadvertent release of the liner lock. The removable stainless pocket clip is not ambidextrous.\nGerber\nThe success of the Gerber's Freeman Fixed Blade (nee \"Hunter\") introduced last year, one of the nicer affordable practical drop point\u00a0 \"hunters\" around, prompted an explosive extension of the line this year from Gerber. The Freeman Folder ($60) has a 3.25 inch drop point blade of 440A stainless steel.\u00a0 Stainless liners and liner lock are covered in pear wood scales.\u00a0 I has ambidextrous thumb studs for opening, a good finger guard and thumb rest, but no pocket clip. It comes with the traditional Gerber nylon sheath which can be carried horizontally or vertically.\nThe Freeman Exchange-A-Blade ($100) is a fixed blade with two sets of multiple blade options. Both versions come with a drop point and saw blade.\u00a0 One comes with a gut hook, the other with a boning blade. The blades slip in the fore end and a push button release on the side of the bolster releases the blade to exchange it. A nylon sheath with pocket for the alternate blades is included.\nA Freeman Caping Knife ($40) is also offered, a fixed drop point 2.5-inch blade.\u00a0 It lacks the lanyard slot of the other Freeman knives, but includes the pear wood scales over the full tang. A molded nylon sheath is provided.\nThe Nautilus ($60) is Gerber's entry this year into the tool wars.\u00a0 This is not a pliers-equipped multi-purpose tool, more of a tool in the SAK tradition. Its claim to fame is an automatic opening coin-cell powered LED flashlight that flips out from the curved ergonomic handle with a press of a side stud, like a \"switchblade.\"\nThe handle gives a good grip for the light, which has a couple tricks itself.\u00a0 Besides a single white LED on the fore end, like a traditional flashlight; it has a second white LED on the underside . This illuminates the blades and tools in use, allowing the user one-handed operations in the dark.\u00a0 The rubber encased switch on the side of the light cycles it through four modes: fore end light, underside light, both lights and a fore end flashing mode.\u00a0 It would be nice if it also automatically shut off the light when you folded it back into the handle; on a number of occasions we found ourselves leaving the light on.\nThe 2.25-inch spear point one-hand opening blade and the rest of the tools lock in place with the same slide lock arrangement as the Legend. There's also a medium size common screwdriver and cap lifter, a #2 Phillips driver and folding scissors.\u00a0 Somewhat surprisingly, the scissors have no spring; there's a large round ring on the moveable handle that you slip the end of your finger into in order to operate the scissor blades. The scissor blades are only 5/8-inch long.\nThe handle is covered with blue rubber inserts making for a secure grip. Overall length is 4 7/16 closed, it's 7/8 inch thick and it weighs 3.6 ounces.\nThe sheath is molded to fit the curved handle and lies flat, much better than typical envelope style nylon sheaths (similar in concept to Bianchi's excellent AccuMold style sheaths).\u00a0 And, at least on the prototype we were provided, the Gerber trademark square corner that usually drives us nuts was trimmed so that it didn't scratch us every time our arm passed over it.\u00a0 We hope that sort of finishing touch makes it into production, and it would be welcome on all their nylon sheaths. On the down side, it was not easy to grab the Nautilus and pull it from the sheath and on a number of occasions we managed to open squeeze the opening stud for the LED light in the process, which was something of an annoyance.\nGerber also introduced the Gator Combo Axe ($40) with a small drop point fixed blade slipped into the hollow handle of what is, essentially, their diminutive Back Paxe. We've seen this done elsewhere and questioned the practicality, we prefer having our knife always immediately available, but it is space efficient.\u00a0 The pair weigh in at 19.2 ounces with nylon belt sheath.\nOn the other hand, we love the Gator textured rubber applied to the handle.\u00a0 One of the most dangerous attributes of small one-handed hatchets/axes is the smooth handle is just a slip away from disaster.\u00a0 We hope they offer the Gator grip on the other small axes in the line.\u00a0 In the meantime, the Gator Axe will also be available separately ($38).\nKershaw\nThe Ken Onion designed Blur ($90 - $100) from Kershaw is another Speed-Safe assisted opening knife along familiar lines, but with a noticeable difference--no flipper! We were told this is in response to the negative reaction in some quarters to the perceived \"switchblade\" action that the flipper encourages. That aside, the knives present an unmistakable Onion profile with anodized aluminum handles with stylized inserts of what Kershaw is calling Trac-Tec, for added grip. The 3.375 (8.6 cm) 440A stainless blade is a recurved drop point profile. A rescue version is equipped with a blunt rounded tip and a carbide glass breaker in the butt end of the handle. There's a \"tactical\" tanto blade version as well. Liner and liner lock are stainless steel and it is equipped with dual thumb studs.\nThe handles are available in either black or red anodized with black inserts, the latter is both eye appealing and a nice change from the usual black. If dropped, the red is lot's easier to find, a feature we prefer. The pocket clip is reversible and there is a lanyard hole, albeit a bit on the small size.\nThe Bear Hunter II ($40) is an affordable conventional sheath knife with a 4.5-inch (11.4 cm) AUS 8A stainless traditional drop point blade. The co-polymer handles have finger scallops and a large integral single guard. The sheath is black leather.\u00a0 There's no lanyard hole, unfortunately.\nThe Nakamura ($180) incorporates a stunning, if somewhat subtle and subdued, bolster comprised of a total of 19 layers, including 10 layers of stainless steel, 5 layers of\u00a0\u00a0 \"vari-colored\" copper and 4 layers of brass, which are exposed to reveal an intricate pattern. Subtler yet is the layered 2.875 (7.3 cm) modified recurved drop point blade comprised of a VG-10 core clad in a single layer of 420J2 stainless. The bolsters are paired with attractive quince wood handles over the stainless liners and liner lock. The pocket clip is removable.\nLeatherman\nIt was out with the old and in with the new at Leatherman this year as they introduced five all new models, improved and revised the Wave (at $87 it's also priced $7 less than previously) and in the process are replacing all but two of the full-sized portion of their multi-purpose tool line.\u00a0 The Model-T of the multi-purpose tool industry, Leatherman's original Pocket Survival Tool (PST), is gone at the end of 2004. Also history will be the PST II, Pulse, Sideclip and Mini-Tool. The Super Tool 200 and Crunch are the only unchanged holdovers of what is now called the \"Classic\" line. They even introduced a new corporate logo.\nTwo new \"Charge\" models now lead the line-up. The Charge Ti and Charge XTi (both $124) are nearly identical; the \"Ti\" part of their name signifying the new cast and machined titanium handles. The interior frame and liner locks are still stainless steel, only the exterior handles are titanium. The machined surfaces serve to provide a much better grip than the smooth stainless handles of the Wave, a feature I liked a lot.\nThese tools retain the familiar Wave format with two blades, file and saw opening from the exterior and the other tools opening from the interior. The interior tools on both the Wave and the new Charge all lock in place, a welcome addition. The lock release is similar to that used on the Crunch, an easily operated lever. Leatherman claims this lock is double the strength of the blade lock used on the current Pulse model.\nThe saw and file remain the same. The primary plain-edge and serrated blades are more robust, wider and with a larger opening slot allowed by the wider blade. This causes them to protrude a bit more from the body of the tool, but that's a fair tradeoff for easier and safer opening. The added width reduced the chances you will slice your thumb when opening the blade, a drawback of the original blade design, and the additional meat makes for a stronger blade with a bit more metal carried all the way to the tip, a weak point (unintentional pun!) in the previous design.\nBronze bushings have been added to the blade pivots on all the external opening blades to ensure smoother and more consistent opening forces. Spacers between the interior tools now allow them to rotate individually, no more \"clumping.\"\u00a0 The down side is that this wastes space, which impacts either width or tool selection. While I personally never found this to be a major issue, they apparently felt it necessary to respond to competition that has successfully made this a marketing issue.\nWhile the blades on the new Wave remain 420HC stainless, the primary plain edge blade on the Charge is 154 CM, a premium high carbon stainless steel formulation which offers a huge improvement in edge holding. Leatherman claims a three-fold improvement over the 420HC and that wouldn't surprise us. Blade length on all of these is increased slightly to 2.94 inches.\nWe also noticed that on the new Charge the blade aligns such that the handles angle up away from the blade slightly, which is much better than the original Wave where they were in straight alignment. The angle makes them much easier to use to cut close to the bottom of something. (see image to right for comparison on new (top) and old(bottom))\nThe serrated sheepsfoot blade has a more angular tip than the traditional curved tip of the previous blade, but still plenty safe.\u00a0 On the XTi, a cutting hook has been incorporated into the spine of the serrated blade, for use slicing through seatbelts and the like.\u00a0 The top of the serrated blade above the opening hole has some ridges to identify it by feel, no need to use a file to add your own as many of us have done to the original Wave.\nAll the new tools share a new and improved pliers jaw and wire cutter design.\u00a0 The jaws have been beefed up and the area around the pivot joint is now elliptical, reportedly resulting in an overall strength increase of 133%.\u00a0 (see comparison in photo at right of new (top) and old (bottom) style pliers jaws) The attachment of the jaws to the handles has also been beefed up and when closed, there is much less movement of the handles than before, which if nothing else, just feels better and higher quality, even if the functional effect is nil.\nThe length of the wire cutters, including the\u00a0 hard wire cutter at the throat of the pliers, has been increased 58%.\u00a0 The XTi model features a built-in crimper for blasting caps and split shot.\nThe new Charge and Wave incorporate bit holders instead of conventional screwdrivers (with a single exception). There are two sizes.\u00a0 The small one holds a double-ended\u00a0\u00a0.058\" flat diver and a Phillips that Leatherman tells me is between #00 and #000 for the really small stuff like eyeglasses and electronics. The larger takes a multitude of double-ended bits, but not the common 1/4-inch hex bits used by others.\u00a0 These bits have unique flattened hex bodies so they are much slimmer.\u00a0 As a result, at least for now, you'll have to buy extra bits from Leatherman. Leatherman claims the S2 tool steel used is 35% stronger than stainless. They have a zinc phosphate coating for corrosion protection. Leatherman believes the zinc phosphate coating \"is safely characterized as offering a 'high' degree of corrosion protection.\" We'll remain a wee bit skeptical of that until we can test them ourselves.\nThe good news is that the bits take up a lot less room. The flatness of the carrier and bits make for compact storage in a sheath. With all the bits double ended, you also gain there as well. These bits also have double ground common screwdrivers, not the single-ground Leatherman has always used, which is better (Leatherman retains the ground sharp edges to its flat screwdrivers which are much better than the eased edges that you get from polished drivers). The larger multi-fluted drivers and hex drivers, such as the #3 Phillips, are truncated slightly on two sides due to the narrow width of the bits; we'll have to wait until we have samples to determine how well that works.\u00a0 Unlike the Tool Adapter which accept normal 1/4 drive hex adapters, Leatherman doesn't yet make one of its \"flattened-hex\" adapters that will allow you to use a conventional 1/4-inch drive socket. I suspect that it's only a matter of time before someone else does, if Leatherman doesn't.\nFor those who prefer the flexibility of Leatherman's original accommodation for interchangeable 1/4-inch hex bits, their Tool Adapter, and don't mind the extra bulk, the existing version that fits the Wave ($28 including plastic case with belt clip and 6 bits) is also compatible with all the new tools.\nThe Wave and Ti come with a double ended #1/#2 Phillips on one end, a la the current Leatherman combination Phillips bits, and a 3/16\" flat on the other. The XTI has one bit holder with a double-ended #1 and #2 Phillips and adds another bit holder with 1/4\" and 3/16\" common blades.\u00a0 The Wave and Ti also include a fixed large common screwdriver, as of old. Leatherman offers a set of 21 double-ended bits in a pair of convenient holders (click for list) ($20) that slip into a pocket on the tool sheaths. One set of 9 or 10 (respectively and including what's installed in the tool) is included with the Charge Ti and XTi. (click for list)\nThere's also the usual can/bottle opener and on the Wave and Ti, the fold-out scissors, which have been modified.\u00a0 While the blades are shorter, Leatherman claims they cut better and retain sharpness longer. The XTI eliminates the scissors, replacing it with that second bit holder.\nThere's a lanyard ring with a large hole, which is good and an improvement over that of the original Wave, but it cannot be deployed without use of some sort of pointed object to pry it out, which is bad, or at the least, inconvenient.\u00a0 Nor does it lock in place and the sliding design could result in the lanyard being cut if it is collapsed in use, also bad.\u00a0 We suggested a few simple modifications to the prototypes they were showing that would address both issues; we'll have to wait to see if they fix that for production.\nSo, just to review, you can click on each tool that follows for photos of the individual tools opened to show how they are equipped: Wave and Wave interior tools , Charge Ti and Charge XTi\nThe Charge models also come with accessories that are also available separately ($5) and will also fit the Wave, a removable pocket clip and larger, quick-release lanyard ring.\u00a0 There's a slot in the pouch to hold the pocket clip if not attached, and while Leatherman says you can use this same slot to hold the lanyard ring, we're not inclined at first glance to find that very practical as implemented.\nSheaths come in both nylon and leather with elastic side pieces. They will hold the tools both closed and open with the pliers sticking out the bottom. The Charge sheaths include two elastic side pockets that can hold small items such as an ARC AAA light or a knife sharpener.\u00a0 The prototype Charge sheaths we saw had metal logo plates attached, which seems like a bad idea to us.\u00a0 One advantage of a well-designed full sheath is that it prevents the metal knife or tool from scratching stuff your scrape against, like your car, for example. These metal plates seem to be just a scratch waiting to happen.\u00a0 For that matter, the bright yellow logo on the Wave sheaths didn't \u00a0do much for us either. I am sure I wouldn't be the only one cutting those off the nylon sheath and declining the leather one for that reason. I don't mind too much being an unpaid advertising billboard for companies whose products I use, I do mind it when it isn't done tastefully.\nA ruler is included on the handles. Weight of the Charge models is 8.4 and 8.3 ounces (Ti and XTi, respectively), the new Wave weighs in at 8.5 ounces. All are 4 inches in length closed. The Wave is 0.687 inches thick, a hair thinner than the current model; the Charge is 0.75 inches thick.\nThe new Kick ($37), Fuse ($49) and Blast ($62) models will replace the PST, PST II, Pulse and Sideclip and all open in the traditional PST manner. Some basics carry through all three new models. All incorporate the improved pliers as used on the Charge and Wave models. Ergonomic Zytel grip inserts along the edges of the handles provide a much improved and more comfortable grip than the older plain steel edges.\nFuse and Blast have locking tools and blades using the same lever lock used on the interior tools of the Charge and Wave and the tools and blades open independently. The Kick has neither lock nor independently rotating tools and blades. The included lanyard ring is plenty large, no need for a split ring anymore.\u00a0 Blade length on the Fuse and Blast is 2.94 inches; on the Kick it is 2.56 inches.\nA comparison of the three tools (images not to scale):\nKick\n"}, {"score": 725.7312, "uuid": "508dbc01-21dc-541f-bc66-7ea251372fe4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0107wb-49-09550", "target_hostname": "www.equipped.com", "target_uri": "http://www.equipped.com/shot_show_2004_knives.htm", "page_rank": 1.1827491e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "SHOT Show 2004 Report - <em>Knives</em> - EQUIPPED TO SURVIVE", "snippet": "It is hardly all-encompassing, many new <em>knives</em> are too wild and impractical to meet my criteria for a functional and practical wilderness survival knife.

With a few exceptions, all had lots of new sharp edges with points to get excited about. However, more often than in prior years, I was shown prototypes but then asked not to write about them. Many manufacturers are holding their cards close until they are nearly ready for production as they fear knock-offs and competitive moves that can develop these days in much less time than used to be the case. Technology has significantly shortened development time when it's not creativity and innovation that is required.\nThis is a very personal report on SHOT Show. What follows are just the highlights from the show that caught my eye. It is hardly all-encompassing, many new knives are too wild and impractical to meet my criteria for a functional and practical wilderness survival knife. For the most part, I have not included tactical or martial arts knives. Also not covered, with a few exceptions that tickled my fancy and which also were reasonably practical, are fancy knives designed primarily to look good or impressive. Due to press of time and various critical time-sensitive projects under way, this review is somewhat shorter than usual. I have not spent time or effort, for the most part, on the more trivial stuff and minor things like new finishes to old products. I appreciate your understanding.\nUnlike years past, I have relied upon the manufacturers for much of the photography. We'll see how that works. It certainly made for a much more enjoyable show for me; I had time to actually have a conversation in many of the booths. My wife joined me for the first time and that also helped to encourage me to take it a little easier and to have some fun and to introduce her to my many friends at the show that I generally only see once or twice a year.\nAssisted opening folders were again popular. Virtually everyone who didn't have one yet, finally succumbed, those that had them introduced variations and line extensions. For the uninitiated, we'll repeat our brief overview on the subject: By \"assisted opening\" we are talking about a spring-powered mechanism that opens the knife once you have started opening the blade. This is differentiated from an automatic (commonly referred to as a switchblade) that opens with just the press of a button or lever or by gravity alone. Some argue it is a distinction without a difference and many fear that assisted opening knives are a potential legal minefield, but for now they are legal in most places and the feds haven't made an issue of it. Mind you, laws against automatic knives are bogus anyway and were enacted in a moment of political hysteria, but that's another issue.\nIn most, but not all cases the spring takes over almost immediately after you start opening the blade, thus for safety's sake in such designs you really need to lock it closed and such knives are equipped with safety locks, which often pretty much defeats much of the supposed advantage the mechanism might provide. Forgetting to lock the safety can result in an assisted opening folder opening in your pocket, with resulting damage to your person or your clothing (been there, done that!). The alternative, which a few manufacturers have implemented, and which we prefer, is to ensure the assist doesn't start until the blade is opened manually a considerable ways.\nIt seems that the traditional drop point blade shape, our favorite, is continuing to make something of a comeback, though nobody had any explanation as to why, other than it's a shape that works. Perhaps it's just one of those everything-old-is-new-again sort of things.\nWe have provided the specifications we received from the manufacturers for the most part; some are much better than others in what they provide, so blame them if you are missing some spec you'd have liked to have seen.\nPrices quoted are manufacturer's suggested retail price as of February, 2004 (we don't waste pixels, or your intelligence, on 95 cents, we just round up). Most gear covered here can be purchased at significantly discounted prices from those quoted.\nAssembling this SHOT Show Report is a major undertaking for this one-man show.

The existing line of U.S. production knives have been renamed as the Blue Class or, for tactical, Black Class and their specials are now the Gold Class.\nThe Mel Pardue designed Model 10505 RANT DPT ($60) is a traditional drop point hunter with a 4.5 inch blade of N690 stainless. This is an Austrian made stainless steel that is supposed to be equivalent to 440C.\nThere is a stainless bolster and butt cap. Benchmade's \"BILT System\" (Blade Inline Tang) incorporates a long nut inside a slot in the full tang, then the butt is secured with a through bolt that is tightened down to lock the polypropylene handle with black Krayton overmold in place.\u00a0 If desired, it can be disassembled for cleaning.\u00a0\u00a0 The nylon sheath has a plastic insert and there's a cross strap with metal snap to retain the knife securely in the sheath. The only real complaint I can make, at first glance, is the lack of a lanyard hole.\u00a0 A bowie version (Model 10500) with molded leather sheath is also available.\nThe Red Class Model 10300 Monochrome ($50) is a Steirer Eisen designed, integral lock folder with stainless handles and a 3-inch N690 drop point blade.\u00a0 It has dual thumb lugs, but the removable pocket clip is right hand only. There's a lanyard hole in the butt and lots of ridges all over the top and bottom for a secure grip. The lock-up felt solid and there's little to indicate it's anything other than the sort of product you'd expect from Benchmade.\nBack to the Blue Class, one of the more strikingly pretty, but still functional new knives is the Model 960 ($200) designed by Warren Osborne.\u00a0 This was originally a limited production design, what would now be called Gold Class, that has been put into production.\u00a0 The detailing is very nice for such a practical knife. It builds on the ergonomic handles of the Switchback, minus the second piggyback knife blade and with a rounded butt.\u00a0 The handles are anodized red aluminum with black G10 inlays.\nThe 3.12 (9.92 cm) \"modified drop point,\" very nearly a spear point, plain edge blade is of D2 steel. The lock is AXIS retained by stainless steel liners. The thumbs studs and pocket clip are ambidextrous. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a lanyard hole.\nAnother practical and functional beauty is the Model 670 Apparition ($140), a Mel Pardue and Warren Osborne collaboration and the first assisted opening knife from Benchmade. The assisted opening mechanism is a new, patented design given the moniker \"Optimiser\" and it has a couple interesting tricks up its sleeve. Most innovative is that the assisted opening function is optional, the user can add it or remove it as desired. Given the legal cloud that's hanging over assisted opening knives in some areas, that could be a mighty useful capability.\nWithout it, the knife is just another one-hand opening liner lock, but add the Optimzer spring rod and it provides the necessary tension for the assist.\u00a0 One of the features we like about this opening assist is that it doesn't become effective until the blade is opened 30 degrees.\u00a0 This eliminates the need for a separate safety and as we have noted before, we prefer this sort of action for assisted opening knives.\nThe 670 features polished stainless steel bolsters and molded imitation kudu horn scales. The back spacer has ersatz file work and the ambidextrous pocket clip is polished. The 3.4-inch (8.64 cm) drop point blade is of 154CM stainless with a plain edge riding between titanium liners. There are dual thumb studs.\nThe Mike Snody designed Model 210 Activator ($140) is a compact drop point full tang fixed blade utility knife.\u00a0 The 2.5-inch (6.35 cm) drop point blade has a high grind.\u00a0 The sculpted three-inch handles with carbon fiber and G10 bolster and scales is both functional and sharp looking. There's a deep finger recess for safety and the spine is ridged for secure thumb purchase.\u00a0 They didn't forget a lanyard hole.\u00a0 It's one of those rare small blades that fits a large hand comfortably.\u00a0 The friction fit sheath is textured black leather and it is designed to slip into a deep pocket.\nBoker\nBoker added the Lamda 189 ($180) to complement last year's small Zeta with a 3-inch Cera-Titan sintered titanium drop point blade. The is a right-handed thumb lug, a plastic half disc actually.\u00a0 The handle is the same Zytel with Kraton insert as used on the Gemini series.\u00a0 It has a pronounced finger guard and an inset stainless steel liner lock with a fixed stainless right-handed pocket clip and a lanyard hole.\nThe Cera-Titan blade is 40% lighter than steel, the whole knife weighs in at 2.7 ounces, and Boker claims it retains an edge very nearly as well as ceramic, which would be very well indeed.\u00a0 Unlike ceramic, if necessary it can be sharpened using normal sharpeners and it is flexible, thus more tolerant of abuse.\nThe Dietmar Pohl designed KAL/KALS 74 series ($33 - $35) in Boker's Magnum line is said to be influenced by the bayonet of the AK-47. They must be talking about the handle, because blade shape itself is a practical modified drop point, something no self-respecting AK-47 ever got close to.\u00a0 Both knives share ergonomic aluminum handles with pronounced finger grooves, ridges on the butt and top fore end and a lanyard hole with a small Kalashnikov medallion inset. The KAL version has a slightly recurved AUS 8 stainless 3.5-inch blade with a thumb stud and stainless liner lock.\u00a0 The KALS has a more traditional drop point style, no thumb opener, and Magnum's pushbutton lock.\nBoker also showed us a sample of a new line of Opinel influenced knives they will be soon be selling. The sample was of a double locking bladed knife, clip point plain edge and blunt tip serrated, with a molded handle and the usual twist style locking mechanism.\u00a0 For those who like the Opinel design, but have despaired of ever seeing anything in modern materials or more innovative designs in that vein, these may well prove to be what they had hoped for.\nBuck Knives\nThe Crosslock is back at Buck Knives , the latest iteration being called the Model 183 Alpha Crosslock PBS.\u00a0 The \"PBS\" stands for Portable Butcher Shop, so it's easy to see what market this knife is aimed at. We always liked to Crosslock design for its two full sized locking blades, but the notable drawback was the lack of any finger guard and weight was also an issue.\u00a0 Buck has addressed both issues with this latest evolution.\nThe blades incorporate a flipper style opener that becomes a finger guard when the blade is opened ; the handles are machined anodized aluminum (black or camo ) with a series of five lightening holes and the whole knife now weighs in at only 4 ounces (113 gr). The pocket clip is ambidextrous and there's a lanyard hole at the top of the butt.\u00a0 While the thumbs studs are set up for right-handed use, the flippers serve to make the blade opening ambidextrous as well . For those who carry in the provided nylon sheath, they also make it easier to grasp and pull from the sheath.\nThe primary blade is a 3-inch (7.6 cm) modified spear point, very nearly a drop point, with a cut-out on the spine, in 420HC stainless. The other blade is an aggressive crosscut saw with a gut hook on its spine. We're pleased to see the Crosslock back with these better features and hope that Buck will produce additional versions with more blade options, as they did before.\nThe Model 290/291 Rush ($73 / $90) is Buck's first assisted opening knife and it incorporates a number of unique features. The skeletonized handle is possible because the assisted opening mechanism is powered by dual coil spring at the fore end around the pivot, what Buck is calling \"ASAP\" for Advanced Spring Assisted Performance.\u00a0 It incorporates a flipper for quick opening, as well as ambidextrous thumb studs. Another innovation is the Cam Lock Safety, which is located immediately behind the flipper on the top of the knife. The lock is a lever that is easily engaged or disengaged with the same finger used to open the blade, making it far less of a hassle than other locks we have experienced to date.\u00a0 We prefer designs that make such locks unnecessary, but if it needs a lock, it should be as convenient to use as possible and this appears to do just that.\nThe two models are identical in other details except that the 291 has an ATS-34 stainless blade while the 290 is 420HC.\u00a0 Handles are anodized aluminum with a 2.5-inch (6.4 cm) drop point blade.\u00a0 The liners and liner lock are stainless. The pocket clip is removable, but not ambidextrous and there's no lanyard hole.\nColumbia River Knife & Tool\nColumbia River Knife & Tool's Convergence folder ($70) is a slim clip point knife that we normally wouldn't make much note of due to its blade shape, but it caught our attention for its unique (patented) \"RealEase\" ambidextrous liner lock release invented by custom makers Charles Kain of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Steve McCowen of Iola, Wisconsin. This is another of those deceptively simple mechanisms that leaves you shaking your head.\nThe \"button\" is located between the frame sides on the bottom of the knife at the fore end. When you pull the release back, using pretty minimal pressure from either index finger, the sloped face of the lock release moves the liner sideways, wedging the liner open and releasing the blade.\u00a0 It's almost too easy for a tactical knife, but we anticipate we'll see a good deal more of this mechanism going forward.\nThe Van Hoy R.S.L. Snap Lock ($50) is another unique offering, worthy of mention if for no other reason than virtually everyone we showed our sample to thought it was cool. The Rotating Snap Lock takes some practice to get used to it and to do it quickly without much thought. Pushing the top sideways spreads the stainless side pieces that form the handle apart allowing the blade to pivot on its pins until it locks in place again. The tighter you squeeze the handle, the more secure the blade is held. Release is just the same; push the lock to the side spreading the handle and the blade can be rotated back.\nVan explained that the knife is designed to ride next to the seam in a pair of blue jeans. Due to its design, the ambidextrous pocket clip requires a different clip depending on what side you wear it on; both clips will be included. Remove the clip and it is fully ambidexterous. The lock also serves as a quick release; wearing it as a neck knife is a viable option.\nThe AUS 6M blade is 2.5 inches long and the warncliff style is reasonably practical.\nKit Carson's new M21 series is based on his popular M16 and M18 designs.\u00a0 It features the trademark open skeletonized handles from the M16, this time in hard anodized 6061 T6 aluminum, no scales, and the robust recurved spearpoint blade design of the M18.\nThe blade is AUS 8 with a frosted finish.\u00a0 It incorporates Kit's \"flipper\" that forms a true finger guard when the blade is locked in place by the integral liner lock. There's CRK&T's LAWKS lock to prevent inadvertent release of the liner lock. The removable stainless pocket clip is not ambidextrous.\nGerber\nThe success of the Gerber's Freeman Fixed Blade (nee \"Hunter\") introduced last year, one of the nicer affordable practical drop point\u00a0 \"hunters\" around, prompted an explosive extension of the line this year from Gerber. The Freeman Folder ($60) has a 3.25 inch drop point blade of 440A stainless steel.\u00a0 Stainless liners and liner lock are covered in pear wood scales.\u00a0 I has ambidextrous thumb studs for opening, a good finger guard and thumb rest, but no pocket clip. It comes with the traditional Gerber nylon sheath which can be carried horizontally or vertically.\nThe Freeman Exchange-A-Blade ($100) is a fixed blade with two sets of multiple blade options. Both versions come with a drop point and saw blade.\u00a0 One comes with a gut hook, the other with a boning blade. The blades slip in the fore end and a push button release on the side of the bolster releases the blade to exchange it. A nylon sheath with pocket for the alternate blades is included.\nA Freeman Caping Knife ($40) is also offered, a fixed drop point 2.5-inch blade.\u00a0 It lacks the lanyard slot of the other Freeman knives, but includes the pear wood scales over the full tang. A molded nylon sheath is provided.\nThe Nautilus ($60) is Gerber's entry this year into the tool wars.\u00a0 This is not a pliers-equipped multi-purpose tool, more of a tool in the SAK tradition. Its claim to fame is an automatic opening coin-cell powered LED flashlight that flips out from the curved ergonomic handle with a press of a side stud, like a \"switchblade.\"\nThe handle gives a good grip for the light, which has a couple tricks itself.\u00a0 Besides a single white LED on the fore end, like a traditional flashlight; it has a second white LED on the underside . This illuminates the blades and tools in use, allowing the user one-handed operations in the dark.\u00a0 The rubber encased switch on the side of the light cycles it through four modes: fore end light, underside light, both lights and a fore end flashing mode.\u00a0 It would be nice if it also automatically shut off the light when you folded it back into the handle; on a number of occasions we found ourselves leaving the light on.\nThe 2.25-inch spear point one-hand opening blade and the rest of the tools lock in place with the same slide lock arrangement as the Legend. There's also a medium size common screwdriver and cap lifter, a #2 Phillips driver and folding scissors.\u00a0 Somewhat surprisingly, the scissors have no spring; there's a large round ring on the moveable handle that you slip the end of your finger into in order to operate the scissor blades. The scissor blades are only 5/8-inch long.\nThe handle is covered with blue rubber inserts making for a secure grip. Overall length is 4 7/16 closed, it's 7/8 inch thick and it weighs 3.6 ounces.\nThe sheath is molded to fit the curved handle and lies flat, much better than typical envelope style nylon sheaths (similar in concept to Bianchi's excellent AccuMold style sheaths).\u00a0 And, at least on the prototype we were provided, the Gerber trademark square corner that usually drives us nuts was trimmed so that it didn't scratch us every time our arm passed over it.\u00a0 We hope that sort of finishing touch makes it into production, and it would be welcome on all their nylon sheaths. On the down side, it was not easy to grab the Nautilus and pull it from the sheath and on a number of occasions we managed to open squeeze the opening stud for the LED light in the process, which was something of an annoyance.\nGerber also introduced the Gator Combo Axe ($40) with a small drop point fixed blade slipped into the hollow handle of what is, essentially, their diminutive Back Paxe. We've seen this done elsewhere and questioned the practicality, we prefer having our knife always immediately available, but it is space efficient.\u00a0 The pair weigh in at 19.2 ounces with nylon belt sheath.\nOn the other hand, we love the Gator textured rubber applied to the handle.\u00a0 One of the most dangerous attributes of small one-handed hatchets/axes is the smooth handle is just a slip away from disaster.\u00a0 We hope they offer the Gator grip on the other small axes in the line.\u00a0 In the meantime, the Gator Axe will also be available separately ($38).\nKershaw\nThe Ken Onion designed Blur ($90 - $100) from Kershaw is another Speed-Safe assisted opening knife along familiar lines, but with a noticeable difference--no flipper! We were told this is in response to the negative reaction in some quarters to the perceived \"switchblade\" action that the flipper encourages. That aside, the knives present an unmistakable Onion profile with anodized aluminum handles with stylized inserts of what Kershaw is calling Trac-Tec, for added grip. The 3.375 (8.6 cm) 440A stainless blade is a recurved drop point profile. A rescue version is equipped with a blunt rounded tip and a carbide glass breaker in the butt end of the handle. There's a \"tactical\" tanto blade version as well. Liner and liner lock are stainless steel and it is equipped with dual thumb studs.\nThe handles are available in either black or red anodized with black inserts, the latter is both eye appealing and a nice change from the usual black. If dropped, the red is lot's easier to find, a feature we prefer. The pocket clip is reversible and there is a lanyard hole, albeit a bit on the small size.\nThe Bear Hunter II ($40) is an affordable conventional sheath knife with a 4.5-inch (11.4 cm) AUS 8A stainless traditional drop point blade. The co-polymer handles have finger scallops and a large integral single guard. The sheath is black leather.\u00a0 There's no lanyard hole, unfortunately.\nThe Nakamura ($180) incorporates a stunning, if somewhat subtle and subdued, bolster comprised of a total of 19 layers, including 10 layers of stainless steel, 5 layers of\u00a0\u00a0 \"vari-colored\" copper and 4 layers of brass, which are exposed to reveal an intricate pattern. Subtler yet is the layered 2.875 (7.3 cm) modified recurved drop point blade comprised of a VG-10 core clad in a single layer of 420J2 stainless. The bolsters are paired with attractive quince wood handles over the stainless liners and liner lock. The pocket clip is removable.\nLeatherman\nIt was out with the old and in with the new at Leatherman this year as they introduced five all new models, improved and revised the Wave (at $87 it's also priced $7 less than previously) and in the process are replacing all but two of the full-sized portion of their multi-purpose tool line.\u00a0 The Model-T of the multi-purpose tool industry, Leatherman's original Pocket Survival Tool (PST), is gone at the end of 2004. Also history will be the PST II, Pulse, Sideclip and Mini-Tool. The Super Tool 200 and Crunch are the only unchanged holdovers of what is now called the \"Classic\" line. They even introduced a new corporate logo.\nTwo new \"Charge\" models now lead the line-up. The Charge Ti and Charge XTi (both $124) are nearly identical; the \"Ti\" part of their name signifying the new cast and machined titanium handles. The interior frame and liner locks are still stainless steel, only the exterior handles are titanium. The machined surfaces serve to provide a much better grip than the smooth stainless handles of the Wave, a feature I liked a lot.\nThese tools retain the familiar Wave format with two blades, file and saw opening from the exterior and the other tools opening from the interior. The interior tools on both the Wave and the new Charge all lock in place, a welcome addition. The lock release is similar to that used on the Crunch, an easily operated lever. Leatherman claims this lock is double the strength of the blade lock used on the current Pulse model.\nThe saw and file remain the same. The primary plain-edge and serrated blades are more robust, wider and with a larger opening slot allowed by the wider blade. This causes them to protrude a bit more from the body of the tool, but that's a fair tradeoff for easier and safer opening. The added width reduced the chances you will slice your thumb when opening the blade, a drawback of the original blade design, and the additional meat makes for a stronger blade with a bit more metal carried all the way to the tip, a weak point (unintentional pun!) in the previous design.\nBronze bushings have been added to the blade pivots on all the external opening blades to ensure smoother and more consistent opening forces. Spacers between the interior tools now allow them to rotate individually, no more \"clumping.\"\u00a0 The down side is that this wastes space, which impacts either width or tool selection. While I personally never found this to be a major issue, they apparently felt it necessary to respond to competition that has successfully made this a marketing issue.\nWhile the blades on the new Wave remain 420HC stainless, the primary plain edge blade on the Charge is 154 CM, a premium high carbon stainless steel formulation which offers a huge improvement in edge holding. Leatherman claims a three-fold improvement over the 420HC and that wouldn't surprise us. Blade length on all of these is increased slightly to 2.94 inches.\nWe also noticed that on the new Charge the blade aligns such that the handles angle up away from the blade slightly, which is much better than the original Wave where they were in straight alignment. The angle makes them much easier to use to cut close to the bottom of something. (see image to right for comparison on new (top) and old(bottom))\nThe serrated sheepsfoot blade has a more angular tip than the traditional curved tip of the previous blade, but still plenty safe.\u00a0 On the XTi, a cutting hook has been incorporated into the spine of the serrated blade, for use slicing through seatbelts and the like.\u00a0 The top of the serrated blade above the opening hole has some ridges to identify it by feel, no need to use a file to add your own as many of us have done to the original Wave.\nAll the new tools share a new and improved pliers jaw and wire cutter design.\u00a0 The jaws have been beefed up and the area around the pivot joint is now elliptical, reportedly resulting in an overall strength increase of 133%.\u00a0 (see comparison in photo at right of new (top) and old (bottom) style pliers jaws) The attachment of the jaws to the handles has also been beefed up and when closed, there is much less movement of the handles than before, which if nothing else, just feels better and higher quality, even if the functional effect is nil.\nThe length of the wire cutters, including the\u00a0 hard wire cutter at the throat of the pliers, has been increased 58%.\u00a0 The XTi model features a built-in crimper for blasting caps and split shot.\nThe new Charge and Wave incorporate bit holders instead of conventional screwdrivers (with a single exception). There are two sizes.\u00a0 The small one holds a double-ended\u00a0\u00a0.058\" flat diver and a Phillips that Leatherman tells me is between #00 and #000 for the really small stuff like eyeglasses and electronics. The larger takes a multitude of double-ended bits, but not the common 1/4-inch hex bits used by others.\u00a0 These bits have unique flattened hex bodies so they are much slimmer.\u00a0 As a result, at least for now, you'll have to buy extra bits from Leatherman. Leatherman claims the S2 tool steel used is 35% stronger than stainless. They have a zinc phosphate coating for corrosion protection. Leatherman believes the zinc phosphate coating \"is safely characterized as offering a 'high' degree of corrosion protection.\" We'll remain a wee bit skeptical of that until we can test them ourselves.\nThe good news is that the bits take up a lot less room. The flatness of the carrier and bits make for compact storage in a sheath. With all the bits double ended, you also gain there as well. These bits also have double ground common screwdrivers, not the single-ground Leatherman has always used, which is better (Leatherman retains the ground sharp edges to its flat screwdrivers which are much better than the eased edges that you get from polished drivers). The larger multi-fluted drivers and hex drivers, such as the #3 Phillips, are truncated slightly on two sides due to the narrow width of the bits; we'll have to wait until we have samples to determine how well that works.\u00a0 Unlike the Tool Adapter which accept normal 1/4 drive hex adapters, Leatherman doesn't yet make one of its \"flattened-hex\" adapters that will allow you to use a conventional 1/4-inch drive socket. I suspect that it's only a matter of time before someone else does, if Leatherman doesn't.\nFor those who prefer the flexibility of Leatherman's original accommodation for interchangeable 1/4-inch hex bits, their Tool Adapter, and don't mind the extra bulk, the existing version that fits the Wave ($28 including plastic case with belt clip and 6 bits) is also compatible with all the new tools.\nThe Wave and Ti come with a double ended #1/#2 Phillips on one end, a la the current Leatherman combination Phillips bits, and a 3/16\" flat on the other. The XTI has one bit holder with a double-ended #1 and #2 Phillips and adds another bit holder with 1/4\" and 3/16\" common blades.\u00a0 The Wave and Ti also include a fixed large common screwdriver, as of old. Leatherman offers a set of 21 double-ended bits in a pair of convenient holders (click for list) ($20) that slip into a pocket on the tool sheaths. One set of 9 or 10 (respectively and including what's installed in the tool) is included with the Charge Ti and XTi. (click for list)\nThere's also the usual can/bottle opener and on the Wave and Ti, the fold-out scissors, which have been modified.\u00a0 While the blades are shorter, Leatherman claims they cut better and retain sharpness longer. The XTI eliminates the scissors, replacing it with that second bit holder.\nThere's a lanyard ring with a large hole, which is good and an improvement over that of the original Wave, but it cannot be deployed without use of some sort of pointed object to pry it out, which is bad, or at the least, inconvenient.\u00a0 Nor does it lock in place and the sliding design could result in the lanyard being cut if it is collapsed in use, also bad.\u00a0 We suggested a few simple modifications to the prototypes they were showing that would address both issues; we'll have to wait to see if they fix that for production.\nSo, just to review, you can click on each tool that follows for photos of the individual tools opened to show how they are equipped: Wave and Wave interior tools , Charge Ti and Charge XTi\nThe Charge models also come with accessories that are also available separately ($5) and will also fit the Wave, a removable pocket clip and larger, quick-release lanyard ring.\u00a0 There's a slot in the pouch to hold the pocket clip if not attached, and while Leatherman says you can use this same slot to hold the lanyard ring, we're not inclined at first glance to find that very practical as implemented.\nSheaths come in both nylon and leather with elastic side pieces. They will hold the tools both closed and open with the pliers sticking out the bottom. The Charge sheaths include two elastic side pockets that can hold small items such as an ARC AAA light or a knife sharpener.\u00a0 The prototype Charge sheaths we saw had metal logo plates attached, which seems like a bad idea to us.\u00a0 One advantage of a well-designed full sheath is that it prevents the metal knife or tool from scratching stuff your scrape against, like your car, for example. These metal plates seem to be just a scratch waiting to happen.\u00a0 For that matter, the bright yellow logo on the Wave sheaths didn't \u00a0do much for us either. I am sure I wouldn't be the only one cutting those off the nylon sheath and declining the leather one for that reason. I don't mind too much being an unpaid advertising billboard for companies whose products I use, I do mind it when it isn't done tastefully.\nA ruler is included on the handles. Weight of the Charge models is 8.4 and 8.3 ounces (Ti and XTi, respectively), the new Wave weighs in at 8.5 ounces. All are 4 inches in length closed. The Wave is 0.687 inches thick, a hair thinner than the current model; the Charge is 0.75 inches thick.\nThe new Kick ($37), Fuse ($49) and Blast ($62) models will replace the PST, PST II, Pulse and Sideclip and all open in the traditional PST manner. Some basics carry through all three new models. All incorporate the improved pliers as used on the Charge and Wave models. Ergonomic Zytel grip inserts along the edges of the handles provide a much improved and more comfortable grip than the older plain steel edges.\nFuse and Blast have locking tools and blades using the same lever lock used on the interior tools of the Charge and Wave and the tools and blades open independently. The Kick has neither lock nor independently rotating tools and blades. The included lanyard ring is plenty large, no need for a split ring anymore.\u00a0 Blade length on the Fuse and Blast is 2.94 inches; on the Kick it is 2.56 inches.\nA comparison of the three tools (images not to scale):\nKick\n"}], [{"score": 721.1705, "uuid": "bb5cf3ca-2b36-57e8-87df-2de2fdebffed", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0913wb-50-09982", "target_hostname": "equipped.com", "target_uri": "http://equipped.com/shot_show_2005_knives.htm", "page_rank": 1.1836072e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "SHOT Show 2005 Report - <em>Knives</em> - EQUIPPED TO SURVIVE", "snippet": "This is one of those forehead slapping, why-didn&#x27;t-<em>I</em>-think-of-this concepts.

", "explanation": null, "document": "SHOT Show 2005 Report - Knives\nT\nhis was the year of the \"II.\" Lots of old classics were updated with better materials or details. We also saw more blades of premium CPM S30V steel, though for the most part it is still seen primarily in more high-end knives. There was no shortage of new and innovative designs, but the large hole left by Schrade's bankruptcy late last year saw many manufacturers pursuing the traditional slipjoint pocketknife market that was their mainstay, and which in the view of many, was a big part of their downfall.\u00a0 It is certainly clear that any knife company that rests on their laurels and fails to innovate and aggressively pursue the fickle consumer with a clear vision and 20/20 insight into their markets is likely doomed.\nWe saw a good deal more knives being produced in China for major manufacturers as they search for lower cost production. The Chinese are quick studies and they are realizing there's money to be made producing quality cutlery, not just the crap for which they have been known up to now. It won't take them long to equal the best Taiwan and Japan can produce, which can be very good indeed.\nThe knives covered here are those that are appropriate for wilderness survival use or which otherwise were of interest to me.\u00a0 This is not an all-inclusive coverage of every knife introduced at the show.\u00a0 Moreover, some manufacturers decline to make appointments and in some cases were not covered since we were unable to sit down and review the new product with them. Others failed to get us promised images of their new products in time. We'll try to get those up if and when they show. (By and large, we no longer photograph knives at the show if we're told images are available; just not enough hours in the day anymore and we're not to the point where we can afford a photographer to follow us around.)\nWe have provided the specifications we received from the manufacturers for the most part; some are much better than others in what they provide, so blame them if you are missing some spec you'd have liked to have seen.\nPlease note that due to unexpected duties involving the development of new standards for emergency beacons that are a result of our findings last year of problems in this area , necessitating a trip to Washington, D.C. right after SHOT Show and now to London for a week, time to compile the Knives portion of this report has been limited. I do hope to add more companies and their wares when I get back.

It is a \"proprietary poly-ceramic coating\" which is claimed to exceed ASTM-117 specification for saltwater corrosion resistance and is purported to be more scratch resistant than previous Benchmade coatings.\nRed Class\nBenchmade's popular priced Red Class line introduced last year, mostly made in Taiwan, was flushed out with three new offerings. Steve Fecas designed the largest knife in the current Benchmade line, a 13-inch (330 mm) long fixed blade with a 7.13 inch (181 mm) spear point blade of 0.219-inch (5.6 mm) thick 440C. It weighs in at 12.58 ounces (356 g). The Offsider ($100) has a very wide false edge extending about two-thirds the way back which provides significant relief to what would otherwise be a pretty massive looking blade. Instead, it makes for an almost slim appearance. Molded textured plastic scales cover most of the full tang, including an integral full guard, with the exception of about a quarter-inch of the tail end, which also incorporates a lanyard hole. The tang curves downward to the rear and also incorporates ridges fore and aft, top and bottom for improved grip. The sheath is a conventional black ballistic nylon with liner and a front pocket.\u00a0 Available with plain edge or with a combo edge in black.\nThe Snipe ($60) is another Fecas design that incorporates the first application of the McHenry and Williams designed Levitator lock to a full-sized knife. Previously used on the pint-sized Benchmite series, in this instance it acts strictly as a blade lock while open, not closed. The release is a button protruding through the middle of the left hand scale. The scales are molded plastic with a pebbled surface over stainless liners. The liner acts as the spring for the pin lock of the Levitator system.\u00a0 The long 3.97-inch (101 mm) AUS8 blade is a modified drop point, very modified (you'd be hard pressed not to call it a clip point), with thumb stud opening and a thumb rest on top. It quite thin at 0.089 inches (2.3 mm) and with a high grind ought to be a good slicer. Round, machined spacers leave an open back on the forward portion of the handle, while the rear has a stainless ridged spacer that extends out the top and back, incorporating a lanyard hole and adding to the grippability. The handle has only a hint of a half guard, along with ridged liners, up front and sweeps down at the rear with a small finger hook.\u00a0 Available in plain or combo edge and in combo edge in black.\nThe Mike Snody designed Japanese influenced Juju ($80) is very nearly a fantasy style fixed blade, and to a utility oriented guy like me, it pretty much is. The stylized, modified tanto chisel ground 440C blade is 4.75 inches (121 mm) long and a hefty 0.219-inch (5.6 mm) thick. The full tang is wrapped with black cord over red ray skin, which is certainly not subtle or nondescript. A natural colored pewter skull and bone menuki (an ornament, typically a pair, under the hilt-wrapping of a samurai style sword, mostly for decorative purposes, but it also improves grip) is restrained under the cord on the right side.\u00a0 The pommel comes to a (skull crusher) point and incorporates a lanyard hole, which is part and parcel of a series of holes that form part of the decoration for the blade. The tang incorporates both a half guard and a finger hook, so all the right practical elements are there. It comes with a very functional molded plastic sheath.\nBlue Class\nWhen Benchmade retired the well-loved Model 705 late last year, the smart money was that some sort of replacement based on the Gold Class limited edition 706 must be waiting in the wings. They were right. The Model 707 Sequel ($150) is a 705 on a Slimfast diet. Aluminum scales make for a much less bulky and lighter (2.6 oz. \u2013 74 g) knife overall, and G10 inlays provide a bit of tactile grip. A new and more robust 2.94-inch (75 mm) drop-point style blade in 154CM stainless upgrades the blade as well. The AXIS lock stays with stainless liners, as does the overall excellent ergonomics. The black coated stainless pocket clip is removable and ambidextrous, tip up carry only. It's available with plain or combo edge and also with a black blade.\nWarren Osborne's take on a gentleman's folder, the Model 440 Opportunist ($150), has sculpted aluminum scales, in a jigged bone type pattern, with wood overlays. The 2.99 inch (76 mm) S30V modified wharncliff blade presents a slim profile that is only 0.114 inches (2.9\u00a0 mm) thick. It's 3.34 inches (85 mm) closed, 0.485 inches (12.4 mm) thick and weighs in at a svelte 1.7 ounces (48 g) The liner lock is stainless with a right-hand opening stud. There's no pocket clip.\nThe expected downsized version of last year's rather large Neil Blackwood Skirmish, the Model 635 Mini-Skirmish ($200) is also a titanium framelock with a 3.43-inch (87 mm) reverse curved blade of CPM S30V in a 4.3-inch (109 mm) handle.\u00a0 Is sports the same ambidextrous thumb hole(s), but the lock and removable stainless pocket clip is set up strictly for right-handers. The bead-blasted handle decoration is a bit more subdued, with a simple spiral pattern and no brightly colored machined detents.\nOriginally a special edition for distributor Moteng International, a tanto blade style was added to the regular Griptilian line (Models 553 and 557 - $95 and $85) and the purple Mini-Grip handles are no more. A sand colored handle for the full sized Grip is now available ($105 with black combo blade), a compliment to the OD colored for those seeing service in the Middle East.\nThe Model 921 two-bladed Switchback by Osborne morphs into the all-black Model 923 ($200) with a BK1 coated black reverse tanto style combo edged CPM S30V main blade (3.4 inches \u2013 86 mm) and black anodized aluminum handles. The smaller slip-joint blade is also black coated, along with the AXIS lock and thumb studs.\nThe Snody Fixed Resistor Model 220 ($150) is a fixed blade version of the striking Resistor.\u00a0 The gotham-swedged clip point blade, plain edge only, of 154CM is 3.4 inches (86 mm) in length, actually a tad shorter than that of the folder. The full tang is scaled in black G10 with three large holes lightening things up, for an overall weight of 4.56 ounces (129 g), while adding to the handles' grippability. It is 7.45 inches (189 mm) in length overall. The sheath is molded Kydex with a leather belt loop attached.\nQuite a bit further afield design-wise is the striking new 425 Gravitator ($170), also designed by Mike Snody. The 3.5-inch (89 mm), 154CM blade is described as a \"modified wharncliff.\" While visually a bit on the wild side, it appears to be a reasonably useful working blade shape with a wharncliff's straight edge from base to tip. The handle (4.77 inches (121 mm) closed) is comprised of titanium liners with barrel back spacers and integral liner lock covered with split G10 scales. The forward piece, referred to as a \"bolster\" by Benchmade, is machined silver G10, while the aft portion is black G10, also sculpted with longitudinal furrows and two grooves matching the profile of the bolster.\u00a0 The end result is both striking and pretty ergonomic, providing a solid grip. The top of the blade is equipped with a very long thumb rest.\u00a0 While there are ambidextrous dual black thumb studs (same concentric domed ring design as the Snody Resistor), the lock and stainless pocket clip are strictly right-handed. It is set up for tip down carry. Available with plain or combo edge and either is also available with the black BK1 coating.\nBlack Class\nThe Black Class saw the addition of an Osborne designed full-tang fixed blade of generous proportions, for a Benchmade. The Model 155 Fixed Presidio ($190) has a BK1 coated blade that is 6.2 inches (157 mm) long and 0.18 inches (4.6 mm) thick. The primary edge combines a short section of very aggressive serrations at the base with an upswept clip point profile. The false edge incorporates another section of serrations, much more conventional in appearance, if not location. I suppose that calling it a false edge no longer quite works, even though most of it still it just that. Handles are black-coated aluminum with a no-slip pattern of directional ridges similar to that found on the Mel Pardue designed Presidio folder. Overall length is 11.2 inches (284 mm) and it tips the scales at 9.92 ounces (281 g).\nThe sheath is a multi-carry style black ballistic nylon unit with an insert and quick-release snapped retention strap.\u00a0 There is also a removable pocket that makes for a very nice folder or multi-tool sheath all by itself.\u00a0 Chances are you'll be able to purchase this smaller ancillary sheath separately.\nNRA Outdoors\nPursuing new markets, Benchmade has developed a new line of knives aimed expressly at the hook and bullet market, NRA Outdoors Knives, a licensed product line of the National Rifle Association. Some of the knives are made in Benchmade's factory in Oregon, others in Taiwan. You'll recognize many of the same Benchmade designers and in some cases, a definite similarity to existing knives as well as some unique new designs.\nStarting off with the folders, the Model 12700 ($65) and 12750 ($55) are Ken Steigerwalt's modern interpretations of traditional three-bladed pocketknives, 4.7 and 3.76 inches closed, respectively (119 mm and 71 mm). Both feature a clip point saber ground lockback main blade, 3.5 and\u00a0 2.8 inches (89 mm and 71 mm), respectively, and a slightly smaller modified spey/skinning blade. 3.12 and 2.5 inches (79 mm and 64 mm).\u00a0 The 12700 has a 3.12-inch (79 mm) gut hook blade and the smaller one has a can-opener and screwdriver combo in the thirds position. All the blades are 440C stainless and open with nail nicks.\u00a0 Liners are stainless and the scales are black micarta.\u00a0 The handle shape is similar to traditional canoe style, the enlarged bolster area at each end providing a bit of security and safety for the fingers.\nThe Model 12400 ($75) and 12410 ($65) are another pair of Steigerwalt lockback designs with a single one hand opening 440C stainless drop point saber ground blade, 3.4 (86 mm) and 2.7 inches (69 mm) long, respectively. They are 4.35 (110 mm) and 3.48 inches (88 mm) long closed, respectively. Liners are stainless covered with sculpted micarta scales. The satin finish stainless pocket clip is reversible; there's no lanyard hole. Available with plain or partially serrated edge.\nMel Pardue's contribution to the new line, the Model 12200 ($70), is a 3.25 inch (83 mm) modified wharncliff bladed one hand opening folder with a textured molded plastic handle.\u00a0 The handle, 4.15 inches closed (105 mm), has a curved underside, but there's not a lot of protection besides the checkering to prevent the hand from slipping onto the blade edge. The lock is\u00a0 Benchmade's Rolling Lock. The black coated pocket clip is reversible; there's a nice sized lanyard hole. Available with plain or partially serrated edge.\nWith a gun-stock shaped handle, the Steve Fecas designed Model 12300 ($29) is the value leader of this line. It has a 3.2-inch (81 mm) one hand opening drop point blade with a liner lock. The 4-inch (102 mm) long molded plastic handle has plenty of grip with its unique shape and there's a good thumb ramp as well.\u00a0 A removable pocket clip is included.\u00a0 Available with plain or partially serrated edge. There's no lanyard hole.\nWarren Osborne's influence is obvious in the lines of the Model 12800 ($170 - $180), the most striking folder in this new line. The machined anodized aluminum handles have a bidirectional waterfall pattern machined into the surface that is both attractive and that provides a very good grip, especially combined with the ergonomic shape having a pronounced finger guard and thumb ramp on the blade's spine. The ambidextrous AXIS Lock, dual thumb stud one-hand opening blade and reversible satin finish stainless split arrow pocket clip will be welcome by lefties. Steel for the uniquely styled 3.4 inches (86 mm) blade is premium 154CM stainless.\u00a0The blade shape might be described as a cross between a tanto and reverse curved drop point.\u00a0 Closed, the knife is 4.5 inches (114 mm) long. Available with plain or partially serrated edge and in a black coated partially serrated version. There's no lanyard hole.\nOf all the knives in the NRA Outdoors line, this is the one that most clearly evidences the Benchmade parentage. It's one of the best looking Osborne folders that Benchmade's done, to my eye (not that any of them are any slouch in the looks department).\u00a0 Regardless of the NRA Outdoors logo on the blade, I suspect most Benchmade Osborne blade collectors will be quick to snap this one up.\nThe line includes three practical fixed blade designs, including another by Osborne. The model 12500 ($100) is an all-around field and camp knife with a 6.25-inch (159 mm) modified drop point blade of 440C. It's got a relatively high grind, which ought to translate into a good slicer. The polished stainless guard is toped by molded Kraton rubber handle that's held in place with Benchmade's B.I.L.T. system, essentially a stainless pommel held on with a beefy socket head screw secured into a nut captured by the full hidden tang that holds the handle in place and allows for disassembly if desired for cleaning. The handle has deep rounded ribs on the lower portion.\u00a0 Unfortunately, there's no lanyard hole. The sheath is tooled leather that covers about two-thirds of the handle with a thumb-break retention strap that snaps in place.\nMike Snoody designed the 12520 ($90) with a 4-inch (102 mm) recurved drop point blade of 440C.\u00a0 There's a false edge that runs about two-thirds the way back on the spine. The full tang has Santoprene rubber overmolded scales with a very deep integral finger choil/guard. The handle incorporates added finger recesses and is very comfortable. There's a good sized lanyard hole.\u00a0 The sheath is a conventional folded ballistic nylon design with a plastic liner and a snap security strap around the handle.\nThe 4-inch (102 mm) skinner, Model 12550 ($100), is a Rick Hinderer design with lots of belly and an upswept tip. Blade steel is 440C. The full exposed tang has black stabilized wood scales that are very ergonomic. The lanyard hole in the tang is exposed by a cutout in the scales. The integral guard is deep and there are also thumb grooves on the blade's spine for added grip.\u00a0 It comes with a traditional style leather sheath with security strap.\nBoker\nFor those who find the pocket clip on a folder ruins the ergonomics or is plain old uncomfortable, Robert Voos has engineered The Boker Clip ($140), a new folder from Boker with a clip that retracts flush into the handle when the blade is opened. This lockback had sculpted aluminum handles, either plain with plain edge or black with partically serrated edge. We were never able to acertain the balde size or material.\nBoker compares the unique opening and locking mechanism of the Tic Toc to a pendulum clock, hence the name. On the right side the cast aluminum handles have a sot of lazy u-shaped slot with a button protruding through the slot.\u00a0 When closed the button sits at the forward top of the slot.\u00a0 Moving the button to the forward bottom of the slot opens the blade and locks it into position as it goes over-center. With very little practice this can be done very quickly and is more that a little bit habit forming\u0097pretty soon it does seem like a pendulum as you sit there opening and closing the knife, again and again. The opening stud is connected to the blade by an arm inside the handle, which could be a concern, only time will tell how strong this is or how well it ages in use. The 3-inch (76 mm) blade is 420 stainless, available in plain or combo edge.\nThe Helios line offers a choice of handle and blade materials, evolved from the Gemini line.\u00a0 The base model in either forest green or black hard anodizing ($165) have aluminum handles with \"cat's tongue\" inserts. Also available is a version with partially checkered rosewood handles ($165).\u00a0 The clip point blade is of X-15 T.N. stainless that is virtually unfazed by salt water or other corrosives.\u00a0 Blade length is 3.5 inches (89 mm) and overall length is 8.25 inches; they weigh in at 4.2 ounces ( g).\u00a0 The stainless pocket clip is ambidextrous and reversible for tip or tip down carry.\u00a0 The Helios Cera-Titan ($250) replaces the steel blade with a drop point made of Boker's unique Cera-Titan sintered titanium.\u00a0The handle inserts in this version are wood and the anodizing a gun metal blue.\nRatcheting up the exclusivity index, there's also a limited serialized edition with a \"Leo\" Damascus blade ($510) forged from the barrel of a Leopard main battle tank and tool steel alloy. The pattern is described at \"small pyramid.\"\u00a0 Inserts are desert ironwood.\u00a0 This is one of a number of unique Damascus steel knives Boker introduced, all of which are already spoke for at $515 to $620.\nThe Titanius ($125) combines Boker's small thin titanium handled gentleman's folder with a one hand opening Cera-Titan blade and liner lock. The drop point blade is 2.375 inches (60 mm). There's a design incised into the handle and a lanyard hole, so you end up with a very practical small lightweight and tough folder.\nNew to all the Cera-Titan line are pewter colored metal thumb disks to replace the cheap looking black plastic ones used previously.\nBuck\nShrink down Buck Knives' Alpha Hunter folder by 30% and you get the Alpha Dorado.\u00a0 Two versions with different blade steel and scales, both have a 2.5 inch (64 mm) drop point one-hand opening blade with partially exposed stainless handles and liner lock, 4 inches (102 mm) closed.\u00a0 Model 270 has a 420HC blade, charcoal birchwood scales and a ballistic nylon sheath ($64) while the Model 271 has an ATS-34 blade, rosewood scales and a leather sheath ($78). The exposed tang contains a lanyard hole; no pocket clip.\nSpeaking of the Alpha Hunter, due to customer demand, Buck now offers replacement \"SureGrip\" rubber scales to replace the wood ones on the ATS-34 bladed versions. $10 buys a complete conversion kit with the rubber handle slabs, replacement screws and an Allen wrench.\nReduce the classic Buck 110 lockback pocketknife by half and you get the aptly named \"The 55\" ($48). The clip point blade of 420HC is 2.375 inches (60 mm) long in a 3.375 inch (86 mm) handle.\u00a0 Like the original, the liner/handles are polished brass with \"natural woodgrain\" inlays. Anyone who has a fond spot for the 110 will eat this one up.\nBuck has added a white LED light to the diminutive Metro, creating the Metro LED ($27) and come up with a new model with an LED light, the Lumina ($55).\u00a0 The Metro LED has a simple on/off function and auto-off after three minutes. The Lumina has four programmed functions: High, medium and low beam and flashing, plus auto-shut off after five minutes.\nThe Metro uses the space dedicated to a bottle cap opener to house the electronics and\u00a0 two 3-volt CR-1616 batteries for the LED, which is contained in a translucent plastic handle. Same liner locked, one hand opening 1.125 inch (32 mm) blade of 420J2 steel as the original.\u00a0 It is 2.375 inches (60 mm) closed with a weight is 1.5 ounces (42 g).\nThe Lumina is also a liner lock with stainless frame and translucent plastic frame housing the electronic guts and two 3-volt CR-2032 batteries. The partially serrated blade is 3 inches (76 mm) of 420HC stainless with a one hand opening slot. 4.375 inches (110 mm) closed, the tail of one liner is exposed and forms a large lanyard hole.\u00a0 All up it weighs in at 3.6 ounces (102 g). The LED is offset to the left on the Lumina and aimed down at the blade, lighting what you may be cutting.\u00a0 If you're going to add a light to a knife, that seems to us like how it ought to work.\nOn both models the On/off switch is a rubber-covered button on the side. The lights are water resistant.\u00a0 Battery change requires a small screwdriver on the Lumina, but none is required for the Metro LED.\u00a0 We have no run time numbers for the lights.\nThe Code 3 CrossLock ($42), developed for emergency personnel use, replaces the saw blade of the Alpha CrossLock PBS with a 3-inch (76 mm) serrated sheepsfoot blade of 420 HC. This is paired with the existing 3-inch (76 mm) drop point blade in the unique double liner lock aluminum frame. The frame is available in anodized gray or red.\u00a0 Red is definitely the way to go, take my word on this. A ballistic nylon sheath is included.\nTom Mayo has designed another series of folders for Buck, the Cutback ($44) and Hilo ($50).\u00a0 Both are satin finish frame locks with a contoured stainless steel frame, drilled with a single line of Mayo's signature lightening holes down the center.\u00a0 A wee bit of flare at the forward end may keep your fingers off the sharp edge of the blade. The one hand opening drop point blade is of 440C stainless, 3.25 inches (83 mm) and 3.625 (91 mm) long, respectively, with a little bit of recurve to it. Overall length and weight is 4.125 inches (104 mm) and 3.3 ounces (92 g)\u00a0 and 4.5 inches (114 mm) and 4 ounces (114 g). The removable clip is also stainless; there's no lanyard hole.\nIn an attempt to keep them affordable, Buck is reproducing some of its classic slipjoint pocketknives in China.\u00a0 For example, the new model 371 Stockman (3.875 inches (98 mm) closed) with three blades of 440C is $28 versus the original made-in-the-USA 301 Stockman, which is $43 with 420HC blades. While the original has black plastic scales, these have Paca wood.\u00a0 Bolsters are still nickel silver with brass liners and the classic Hammer and Bolt Buck logo inlay. Also being produced is a mid-sized 373 Trio (3.25 inches \u2013 83 mm) three blader ($24), a two bladed 375 Deuce (2.625 inches - 67 mm)($20) and a 3-inch (76 mm) single blade folder, the 379 Solo ($15).\u00a0 Buck is standing behind these knives with their \"4-Ever Warranty\" and insists they are being built to strict quality standards.\nColumbia River Knife & Tool\nColumbia River Knife & Tool was aggressively promoting their new Merlin quick deployment sheath\u00a0that was designed by Michael Martinez. This unique patented concept allows for the folder to be carried in a variety of positions and when pulled from the sheath it automatically deploys.\u00a0 Somewhat akin the Emerson's Wave concept as it deploys from a pocket, but working with virtually any medium to large folder, the Merlin sheath provide very quick deployment without the need to manually open the blade. While it didn't take long to learn the basics of how to use it with the designer demonstrating the system, for the rest of us it comes with an instruction book, 52 pages worth for the \"Professional\" model ($35) with a multitude of carry and deployment options or a smaller 18 page manual for the \"Sport & Work\" model ($30) which covers only a few more traditional belt carry modes.\nAutomatic opening or assisted opening knives need not apply, but most others will work, including traditional folders without one-hand opening. The listed parameters are as follows: Blade Length between 2.5 inches (64 mm) and 5 inches (127 mm); Maximum Blade Thickness of 0.25 inches (6.3 mm), Maximum Blade Width of 1.5 inches (38 mm); Maximum Knife Weight of 8 ounces (227 g) and a Blade Channel Width (the space between the liners) between 0.125 inches (3 mm) and 0.1875 inches 5 mm).\nThe clip is designed to clip into a pocket or waistband, etc., or onto a belt or shoulder strap up to two inches (51 mm) wide.\u00a0 The point of the blade is inserted into a recess in the sheath with a sliding wedge to ensure it is a tight fit. The handle is then folded over and closed on an ear on the side of the sheath wedging it as tightly as possible.\u00a0 Once in place it is fairly well secured and takes a strong jerk to pull it loose, it isn't going to fall out or be easily dislodged. With the knife in place, this can leave a small portion of the blade exposed, which might imperil a small finger, so best not to use this around curious or clingy young children if your knife is one of those that does so. Some knives we tried covered virtually all the blade edge.\nThe sheath rotates into eight positions in relation to the clip and locks in place with a neoprene o-ring and screw . The clip is very secure. As you pull the knife handle the sheath rotates as necessary (up to 45 degrees) to allow the blade to come loose, automagically deploying it into the fully open, and if equipped with a blade lock, locked position. It does work as advertised; we took a sample home and tried it on a variety of knives and from numerous carry locations.\u00a0 If there's a notable drawback to the concept, it is that the same features that make this quick draw sheath so easy to deploy from also leave your knife exposed such that it could be grabbed by someone else. For some potential uses, especially for law enforcement personnel, that may be a concern.\u00a0 In addition, it most definitely is not sheeple friendly.\nThe Merlin II ($50) is a somewhat similar concept for fixed blades . It resembles a conventional rigid molded plastic sheath in most respects, but incorporates the rotating positioning system like that used on the Merlin but limited to 45 degrees and also includes the same strong clip.\u00a0 The bottom of the sheath is modular and exchangeable to accommodate different length blades.\u00a0 The standard cap holds blades up to 4.8 inches (122 mm). Four alternative caps ($7 to $10) accommodate blade lengths of 5.4 inches (137 mm) to 8.4 inches (213 mm) in one inch (25.4 mm) increments.\u00a0 Maximum blade thickness is 0.22 inches (5.5 mm) and blade width is from 0.72 inches (18 mm) to 1.65 inches (42 mm).\nThe blade is held in place by a curved spring that presses against the blade which in turn is lodged against two \"rails on the inside of the exterior wall of the sheath.\"\u00a0 At least that's how CRK&T explains it, they didn't have a sample for us to examine.\u00a0 There's also an ancillary thumb break strap to go around the handle for added security, if desired.\nAlso introduced was a Michael Martinez designed fixed blade, dubbed the Ultima ($120).\u00a0 While the blade is a conventional clip point of \"1.4116\" stainless steel (a German steel with performance similar to 440A according to CRK&T), 6.75 inches long, the handle is anything but conventional. Designed based on input from a panel of medical specialists including ergonomic experts, kinesthesiologists and a surgical tool designer, it incorporates 22 of the 23 \"points of contact\" in the hand that were determined as being the ideal handle by these experts.\nWhether this is real science or voodoo, the result is definitely different. It was difficult to tell how good a grip was to be had, both because of limited time to play with it and also because the prototype samples' scales had wire cut edges that were very sharp and gripping tightly was just plain uncomfortable due to this.\u00a0 There are lots of edges as the molded Zytel handle is comprised of a series of \"over 70\" triangular shapes with channels between them .\u00a0 These channels, referred to as sipes (a term usually used in reference to tire design) or \"ooze grooves,\" are designed to channel away mud, water and blood to ensure a good grip even in these difficult environments. Anyone who has seen video of a tire channeling away water to prevent hydroplaning will understand this concept.\nThe full tang extends out the back into a pry bar shape that also serves as a hook to help maintain a grip. Up front the scales expand to form a ramped full guard.\u00a0 The scales partially cover the top and bottom of the tang , so there's no contact with the metal, a feature we like.\u00a0 The blade is available with or without a small serrated section at the base of the blade and both have a bead blast finish. Overall length is 11.625 inches (295 mm) and it weighs in at 9.4 ounces (266 g).\nWe found it in intriguing that the standard sheath for this knife isn't the Merlin II , but rather is a traditional ballistic nylon tactical sheath with storage pocket.\nThe Van Hoy Snap Lock is now joined by a smaller sibling, the Snap Lock 2 ($50) with a 1.75 inch (44 mm) blade, 3 inches (76 mm) closed and 4.375 inches (111 mm) open. Same ambidextrous opening and closing with the unique Snap Lock and the blade steel is again AUS 4.\nA new Van Hoy design, the Snap Fire ($90) with yet another new lock design that is very eye-catching.\u00a0 The lock incorporates a large a stainless steel wheel with \"specteral titanium nitride coating\" and small serrations around the circumference. One hand opening is accomplished by rotating this wheel.\u00a0 A\u00a0 compression lock secures the 2.375 inch (60 mm) AUS 8 drop point blade in place.\u00a0 A safety, which operates like the LAWKS we've seen on most CRK&T liner locks, can be used to ensure the lock doesn't disengage inadvertently.\nClosing the blade is where things get a little weird.\u00a0 You press down on that stainless wheel to disengage the lock, which actually moves the blade pivot away from the lock allowing the blade to be closed by rotating the wheel.\u00a0 It's a whole lot easier to do than to describe.\nThe single-sided frame of the knife is gray anodized aluminum withy large cut-out, creating a skeletonized look.\u00a0 A curvaceous stainless steel bade guard protects the blade on one side, mirroring the removable pocket clip on the other side.\u00a0 Available in plain or combo edge.\nThe Side Hawg ($30), designed by Mike Franklin, takes the side blades used on the Serengeti folder to the logical endpoint, getting rid of the folder.\u00a0 The single edge grind blade of 420J2 stainless rides flat against the Zytel \"sheath plate,\" held in place by a stud and spring clip.\u00a0 The knife itself is 4.375 (111 mm) overall with a 0.12 inch (3 mm) thick skeletonized handle and a skinner style blade with a 1.625 inch (41 mm) cutting edge.\u00a0 There's a deep guard/choil and ridges on the top for thumb purchase. The whole package is 5.375 inches (137 mm) long, weighs 2.6 ounces (81 g), and it comes with a nylon strap and carabiner attached to the lanyard hole.\nThe Signature Hunter Series ($60) are three fixed blades with full tangs and bamboo scales, designed by Russ Kommer. The blades are 1.4116 stainless and there is a drop point, clip point and skinner with a gut hook. Blade length is 3.25 inches (83 mm),\u00a0 3.5 inches (89 mm) and 3.25 inches (83 mm) respectively, overall length is 7.879 inches (200 mm), 7.25 inches (184 mm) and 7.625 inches (194 mm), respectively. The blades have a very high hollow grind.\u00a0 A deep finger choil/ half guard with friction groves and thumb rest with same provide a good grip. The tang extends beyond the scales and there's an ample lanyard slot.\u00a0 The fitted leather sheath is very nice with perimeter tooling and burnished edges.\nTwo new Pat & Wes Crawford assisted opening designs, the Voodoo and Wild Weasel (both $130), are both their first assisted opening blades and the first knives produced in the U.S by CRK&T. Scales are hard anodized gray aluminum with stainless liners, dual thumb studs, and ambidextrous pocket clip. The blades are 154CM stainless, bead blasted and available with either plain or combo edge.\u00a0 The scales have black Santoprene inserts. The Wild Weasel has a drop point blade with a thumb ramp and long false edge. The Voodoo blade is a spear point with three graduated holes in the spine.\u00a0 Neither knife is equipped with a lanyard hole.\nKnife sharpening remains a mystery to many knife owners. At best they end up with a blade that is less dull, sometimes the blade is ruined and many won't even try, relying on professionals or sending the knife back to the factory. It's a practiced skill that simply has fallen into disuse. The simple systems require a fair amount to considerable skill to use and/or too use without ruining the blade and the guided system approach doesn't lend itself to being set up and used easily and quickly. As for powered systems; let's not even go there. CRK&T's new Slide Sharp ($35) is sort of the Dummies Guide of knife sharpeners, developed by Steve McCowen and Charles Kain.\nThis is one of those forehead slapping, why-didn't-I-think-of-this concepts.\u00a0 A 9.45 inch (240 mm) long ceramic rod\u00a0 is inserted into a wood base a few inches square. The kit comes with 2 ceramic rods, fine and course.\u00a0 You then drop a spring over the rod and then a plastic guide that has two slots in it, each at a different angle to the rod.\u00a0 Finally, there's a small domed handhold to go on top of the rod.\u00a0 Hold the rod steady with one hand at the top and simply slip the knife into the slot and run the guide down the rod while pulling the knife through.\u00a0 Release and the guide pops up again for another pass.\u00a0 Switch the blade direction in the guide to do the other side of the blade.\nThe current guide has a \"fine\" and \"utility\" setting, 17 and 21 degrees (nobody seems to know how they came to select those odd angles), but others will eventually be available and it wouldn't be all that difficult to make your own.\u00a0 It is all packed in a plastic box.\u00a0 We're hopeful; they'll come up with a field sharpener using the same concept, but which will pack into a much smaller box.\nA smaller version of the titanium handled M16, model M16-01T ($110), has been added with a 3.125 inch (79 mm) spear point AUS 8 blade.\nChris Reeve\nAnother Bill Harsey fixed blade design, Neil Roberts Warrior Knife ($329) is being produced by Chris Reeve , this a commemorative blade commissioned by Navy Chief Steven Bronson in honor of Petty Office First Class Neil Roberts, killed in action during Operation anaconda in Afghanistan in 2002, the first SEAL to loose his life in action since 1989. Roberts graduated from SEAL Class #184 and that number of serialized and specially engraved knives have been set aside for the SEAL community.\nIf you're not a SEAL, you can still get one, minus the serial number and engraving, but otherwise identical. The 6-inch (152 mm) S30V drop point plain edged blade is KG Gun-Kote coated, like the rest of Chris' fixed blades. Overall length is 11 inches (279 mm) and weight is 12.3 ounces (349 g). Handle slabs are sandblasted black canvas micarta. The handle incorporates an angled full guard and deep finger scallop and the requisite lanyard hole. There's a finger choil ahead of the guard. Sheath is a tan Combat Master by Spec-Ops. I like this one better than the Harsey designed Green Beret knives, it has my favorite blade shape, no serrations and it's just the right size.\nA trust fund has been established to support the education of Neil Robert's son, Nathan. Twenty dollars from each knife purchase is contributed to this fund ( click for more information on the Neil Roberts Memorial Project )\nChris also came out with a spear point version of the Nkonka, which is otherwise identical to the original, having the tool kit in the hollow handle.\nGerber\nGerber's LMF II is available in two versions, the ASEK (Aircrew Survival Egress Knife) ($120) and the Infantry(??). The only difference is that the ASEK comes with a Safety Knife for cutting seat belts and parachute shrouds. This is also available separately ($??). The LMF II is 10.59 inches (269 mm) overall length with a black coated stout clip point 4.84-inch (123 mm) blade of 12C 27 Sandvik steel. The knife weighs 11.4 ounces (323 g). The blade is approximately 50% serrated. The overmolded Hytrel rubber handle incorporates a double guard and the same design technology as the Silver Trident with the pommel/butt cap separated from the tang, isolating it completely. That butt cap incorporates both a robust pointed plexigalss/canopy breaker and a hammerhead designed to be used with the knife held in its sheath, as well as a large lanyard hole. The guard is pierced with holes and the handle has a depression to leave room for a a shaft to allow the knife to be used as a spear, though why anyone would want to is beyond us. That's just a good way to lose your second most important survival tool. You probably already lost your first if you try this trick.\nThe sheath has a soft rubber overmolding on the main molded plastic sheath body to cut down on noise. The plastic sheath is attached to a ballistic nylon upper portion with straps and it is equipped for a variety of carry modes. It is fully compatible with the MOLE system with straps required included, or can just be hung on your belt. It comes with Fastek style buckle-equipped straps for leg or calf attachment. There are double snapped retention straps around the handle and slots and holes in the sheath for about any sort of attachment means you could imagine. It is claimed to be suitable for parachuting, which we don't doubt. The sheath incorporates a removeable pull-though carbide sharpener attached on the face of the sheath body, about as easy to use as possible, no skill required. Both the handle and sheath are dark tan in color, the ballistic nylon is brown.\nThe Safety Knife is pretty much your standard seat belt cutter with a slotted double razor blade cutter molded into a plastic handle. It requires its own separate ballistic nylon sheath with a Velcro retained flap.\nGerber's latest entry in the multi-tool warts is the Diesel Multi-Plier ($90), which is more or less a buffed-up version of their Multiplier. It retains the same basic operation with one-hand opening sliding pliers and the like. This is a needlenose design with the pliers' jaws being substantially bulked up compared to the original for added strength. There's a much longer wire cutter section incorporated into the pliers.\nAll the blades and tools lock with somewhat larger overmolded lock releases. The tools seem a bit beefer as well, though don't have exact measurements. The knife blade is a sort of tanto-esque design, 50% serrated. A double-row wood saw mimics this same shape. This is a dedicated saw blade, not the universal saw coupler that accepted jigsaw blades as used in some previous Multi-Pliers. The scissors have longer blades and appear to be better designed so they won't as easily jam in the cut like all th eothers Gerber has.\nThere's also a metal/wood file, can opener, three flat screwdrivers, Phillips driver and a lanyard loop. They eliminated the solderless terminal crimper between the handles of the standard Multi-Pliers, which we hate to see go away. A ballistic nylon sheath is included.\nMessing with a classic can be risky, but the new Gator II folders are a definite big step up (then originals will still be available). Still a lockback with their trademark tacky rubber grip, they now have a one hand opening blade, via a slot in the blade. The 4.49 inch (114 mm) handle has an added finger scallop, three total now, with ridges in the handle top and bottom. The 3.70-inch drop point blade of ??? stainless has a lot of belly and a ridged thumb rest. It is available in both plain and partially serrated edge. There's also a version with a gut hook in the spine, also with plain or partially serrated options. There's also a lanyard hole, which the original lacked, and it all weighs in at 3.4 ounces (96 g). Includes a thermoformed ballistic nylon sheath.\nThe Gator Exchange-A-Blade Saw takes the original excellent Exchange-A-Blade Saw and beefs it up with a Gator Grip molded handle, easier to operate top lock and a bit bigger blade. The saw is 8.78 inches (223 mm) closed and the blades are 6.65 inches (169 mm) long. This compares to 8.19 inches (208 mm) and 6.18 inches (157 mm) for the original (which is still available).\nI'll have to try this saw out to see how well the grippier Gator handle works in heavy use. Without gloves my concern would be that it could create hot spots and blisters. Sawing is not the same as using a knife. I do like that they have also added a lanyard hole. As before, they offer it with only one blade or with both a fine/bone saw and coarse/wood saw. With the two-bladed combination you get a ballistic nylon sheath.\nGerber's joined the assisted opening club with the Fast Draw ($60) using \"Forward Action Spring Technology.\" You've just got to wonder how many brain cells bite the dust as these knife company marketing types try to come up with trademarkable and catchy acronyms for their designs. In any case, custom maker Butch Vallotton, well known for his automatic knives, designed this patented opening mechanism. The 3.25 inch (83 mm) drop point 440 stainless blade has an opening stud or a small flipper poking through the top of the handle to start things opening. It takes only a little movement. The slide safety located in the side of the left scale also serves to release the lock to allow the blade to close. Closed, the Fast Draw is 4.19 inches (106 mm) with a patterned Zytel handle. Available in plain or partially serrated edge, there's no lanyard hole.\nHeckler & Koch\nHK introduced a well-rounded line of fixed blades and folding knives, all designed by Mike Snoody and produced by Benchmade. The HK34 AXIS Tactical Folder and Auto models ($220 and $258) are available with either a tactical drop point blade or a radical tanto style. The 3.4-inch (86 mm) blades are 154CM and have a high thumb ramp rising over the dual thumb studs. The partial liners are stainless to secure the AXIS Lock inlaid into cast aluminum handles having an overmolded Zytel overlay on the aft portion of the handle.\u00a0 The result is an appearance of an aluminum bolster, but it is all integrated. Overall length open is 8.19 inches (208 mm) and the weight is 5.6 ounces (159 g).\nIn the AXIS Tactical, both blades are available in plain or combo partially serrated edge with the drop point plain edge and tanto combo edge also available with black Zytel coating.\u00a0 The Auto is available only in combo edge with the black coating. There's no lanyard hole, but the black pocket clip is reversible.\nThe KN30 Liner Lock ($110) one hand opener has stainless liners with overmolded black Zytel handles patterned similarly to the HK34 series, but with a deep finger choil/guard. The 2.97-inch (75 mm) satin finish blade is N690 stainless in a clip point recurved shape with a wide false edge that extends all the way back to the low-rise thumb ramp.\u00a0 Overall length is 6.84 inches (174 mm).\u00a0 There's a removable black pocket clip, but no lanyard hole. Available in plain or combo edge.\nThe HK36 Tactical Fixed Blade ($150) has a 3.62-inch (92 mm) broad recurved hollow ground plain edged blade of 440C stainless. The spine has a short section of false edge, then two scallops followed by a long grooved thumb rest, resulting in a distinctive profile.\u00a0 Three holes drilled in the blade spine add another decorative element. The black molded Zytel scales have three scalloped cutouts that reveal the full tang, each with three small decorative drilled dimples. The finger choil/half guard is deep for security.\u00a0 There's a lanyard hole in the butt with an included braided lanyard and it slips into a molded and riveted Zytel sheath. The blade is 0.150 inches (3.8 mm) thick and the knife is 7.62 inches (194 mm) overall and weighs 4.3 ounces (122 g).\nThe 5-inch (127 mm) fixed blade continues the length-derived naming as the HK50 Tactical Fixed Blade ($198). The straightforward drop point blade is of 440C with a black Xylan coating and 60/40 partially serrated combo edge. The false edge extends well back on the spine and the prominent thumb ramp extends well forward. The scales attached to the full tang are multilayered G10 for a unique look, with the outer layer machined with lots of tactile grooves for a good grip. There are two deep finger scallops and a rounded butt with a lanyard hole. Sheath is a typical ambidextrous Cordura nylon tactical style with a storage pocket having a Velcro'd flap.\nKershaw\nKershaw's primary designer, Ken Onion, collaborated with Frank Centofante to create the Centofante-Onion, which is available with two handle materials.\u00a0 The Model 1610 ($70) has anodized red aluminum handles with a curvy design machined into them and the Model 1615 ($100) has polished stainless steel handles coated with black Tungsten DLC coating. The handles have three graduated round recesses at the rear of the handle inlaid with genuine pearl. It adds a touch of class, especially to the 1615 where the pearl and DLC coating really compliment each other nicely. Both Kershaw's SpeedSafe assisted opening mechanism, stainless liners and liner lock and are equipped with a Centofante inspired wharncliff blade of 440A stainless, 2.25 inches (57 mm) long.\u00a0 Closed the knives are 3 1/8 inches (79 mm).\u00a0 The 1610 weighs 1.6 ounces (45 g) including a removable pocket clip; the 1615 weighs 2.4 ounces (68 g) and has a leather sheath with clip.\nThe Mini MOJO ($100) is another Ken Onion SpeedSafe assisted opener with a newly patented Stud Lock . This ambidextrous lock incorporate the dual opening studs (which aren't the primary opening mechanism on these and most other Kershaws, they are equipped with Ken Onion's original flipper design incorporated into the blade) as the lock. The studs are spring loaded with a compression spring and slide fore and aft in a slot in the blade. When the blade is fully open, they lock back into a recess in the forward top part of the handle. The lock is self-adjusting due to a slight ramp in this recess. Simply moving the studs forward releases the blade. We have some concerns upon our limited\u00a0 examination that this could be pretty easily done inadvertently, compromising the blade lock's utility and safety.\u00a0 We'll have a better idea if this is an issue after we receive a sample to field test.\nThe handles are stainless with a satin finish and a large G-10 insert.\u00a0 The handle incorporates a prominent guard and finger hook and is equipped with a lanyard hole. That guard and oversized flipper may help to counteract the potential of inadvertent release of the lock; they will close on the finger which would prevent the blade from closing, though we're not sure that's the best solution.\nThe 440A stainless recurved blade is 2 3/8 inches (61 mm) long and closed the Mojo measures 3.5 inches (89 mm). There's a prominent false edge and thumb ramp. It's a hefty knife for its size at 3.1 ounces (?g).\nKershaw shrunk the Ken Onion designed Boa into the Baby Boa ($75), though you have to look closely to see the family resemblance because this baby is pretty dolled up compared to the original's tactical look.\u00a0 It has full stainless liners and liner lock with partial aluminum scales, anodized with a red with black smoked finish, that allow the drilled liners to peek out from behind for a unique look. A cutout in the left scale provides a view of the torsion bar spring that drives the assisted opening. There's a lanyard hole at the rear. The SpeedSafe assisted opening recurved blade is 440A, 2 inches (51 mm) long.\u00a0 Closed, it is 2.75 inches (70 mm) long. It weighs in at 1.7 ounces (48 g).\u00a0 For those who liked the size of the Chive, but not the very narrow tip, the baby Boa will be a welcome alternative.\u00a0 Now they just need to add some more elegant finishes.\nA new Ken Onion fixed blade design, the Outcast ($100), is a large bolo style blade, sort of Kershaw's answer to the BK&T Brute. The blade is 10 inches (254 mm) of titanium nitride coated D2 steel. The signature style Ken Onion handle is Santoprene rubber overmolded on top of glass-filled nylon. Incorporated into the handle si a very deep half guard and the handle swells at the top as well. Overall, the Outcast is 16 inches (406 mm) long and weighs 22 ounces (624 g). The molded Kydex sheath includes a security strap for added insurance.\nWhile it hit the market shortly before SHOT Show, this was out first opportunity to sample the Two Can ($30).\u00a0 This small executive folder combines a knife blade and scissors in a unique manner. There is a one hand opening chisel ground wharncliff blade, non-locking, of 420 stainless, 1.5 inches (35 mm) long. Open the second blade that lies alongside the first using a nail nick and you have a very functional pair of scissors for light cutting.\u00a0 In this configuration, you squeeze the scissors blades directly.\u00a0 The handles are stainless, 2.75 inches (70 mm) closed, and incorporate a small carabinier clip on the tail end which would do fine to hold keys and the like.\u00a0 It seems like this would be a perfect tool for an office setting.\nLeatherman\nThe emphasis at Leatherman this year was big--really big.\u00a0 Huge might be a better description. The new Core ($78) and Surge ($102) multi-tools are the largest ever offered by the company, and arguably the biggest folding tools with full\u2013sized pliers available anywhere (the previous heavyweight was the Victorinox SwissTool).\nThe Core weighs in at 10.2 ounces (289 g), or 13.2% more than the Super Tool 200 it replaces and 0.2 oz (6 g) more than the SwissTool. That translates into larger implements with greater strength and reach.\nThe Surge is more or less a Wave on steroids---lots of steroids! At 12.2 ounces (346 g), all included, it is 35.5% heavier than the Super Tool 200, 21.6% more than the new Core and a whopping 43.5% more than the Wave. Looking at it another way, the Surge tips the scales at just over three-quarters of a pound. And, that's even before adding the weight of the sheath, 1.2 oz (34 g) for nylon or 2 oz. (57 g) for leather. Only real men and amazons need apply.\nBoth tools are 4.5 inches (114 mm) in length, closed, same as the Super Tool. The Core is 0.75\" inch (21.3 mm) thick; the Surge is 0.781 inch (22.1 mm) thick.\nHere's a table comparing the blades and implements included in the two new tools:\n"}, {"score": 720.4807, "uuid": "fe2ead0c-674e-5650-a9de-5008c3d03341", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0500wb-47-14330", "target_hostname": "www.equipped.com", "target_uri": "http://www.equipped.com/shot_show_2005_knives.htm", "page_rank": 1.1817908e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "SHOT Show 2005 Report - <em>Knives</em> - EQUIPPED TO SURVIVE", "snippet": "This is one of those forehead slapping, why-didn&#x27;t-<em>I</em>-think-of-this concepts.

", "explanation": null, "document": "SHOT Show 2005 Report - Knives\nT\nhis was the year of the \"II.\" Lots of old classics were updated with better materials or details. We also saw more blades of premium CPM S30V steel, though for the most part it is still seen primarily in more high-end knives. There was no shortage of new and innovative designs, but the large hole left by Schrade's bankruptcy late last year saw many manufacturers pursuing the traditional slipjoint pocketknife market that was their mainstay, and which in the view of many, was a big part of their downfall.\u00a0 It is certainly clear that any knife company that rests on their laurels and fails to innovate and aggressively pursue the fickle consumer with a clear vision and 20/20 insight into their markets is likely doomed.\nWe saw a good deal more knives being produced in China for major manufacturers as they search for lower cost production. The Chinese are quick studies and they are realizing there's money to be made producing quality cutlery, not just the crap for which they have been known up to now. It won't take them long to equal the best Taiwan and Japan can produce, which can be very good indeed.\nThe knives covered here are those that are appropriate for wilderness survival use or which otherwise were of interest to me.\u00a0 This is not an all-inclusive coverage of every knife introduced at the show.\u00a0 Moreover, some manufacturers decline to make appointments and in some cases were not covered since we were unable to sit down and review the new product with them. Others failed to get us promised images of their new products in time. We'll try to get those up if and when they show. (By and large, we no longer photograph knives at the show if we're told images are available; just not enough hours in the day anymore and we're not to the point where we can afford a photographer to follow us around.)\nWe have provided the specifications we received from the manufacturers for the most part; some are much better than others in what they provide, so blame them if you are missing some spec you'd have liked to have seen.\nPlease note that due to unexpected duties involving the development of new standards for emergency beacons that are a result of our findings last year of problems in this area , necessitating a trip to Washington, D.C. right after SHOT Show and now to London for a week, time to compile the Knives portion of this report has been limited. I do hope to add more companies and their wares when I get back. Thanks for your understanding.\nPrices quoted are manufacturer's suggested retail price as of February, 2005 (we don't waste bytes, or your intelligence, on 95 cents, we just round up). Most knives and tools covered here can be purchased at significantly discounted prices from those quoted. In some cases, items will not be available until much later this year.\n(Disclaimer: Editor Doug Ritter, author of this SHOT Show cutlery review, is currently collaborating with Benchmade Knife Company on a series of knives and may in the future collaborate with other manufacturers included in this report.)\nAssembling this SHOT Show Report is a major undertaking for this one-man show.

It is a \"proprietary poly-ceramic coating\" which is claimed to exceed ASTM-117 specification for saltwater corrosion resistance and is purported to be more scratch resistant than previous Benchmade coatings.\nRed Class\nBenchmade's popular priced Red Class line introduced last year, mostly made in Taiwan, was flushed out with three new offerings. Steve Fecas designed the largest knife in the current Benchmade line, a 13-inch (330 mm) long fixed blade with a 7.13 inch (181 mm) spear point blade of 0.219-inch (5.6 mm) thick 440C. It weighs in at 12.58 ounces (356 g). The Offsider ($100) has a very wide false edge extending about two-thirds the way back which provides significant relief to what would otherwise be a pretty massive looking blade. Instead, it makes for an almost slim appearance. Molded textured plastic scales cover most of the full tang, including an integral full guard, with the exception of about a quarter-inch of the tail end, which also incorporates a lanyard hole. The tang curves downward to the rear and also incorporates ridges fore and aft, top and bottom for improved grip. The sheath is a conventional black ballistic nylon with liner and a front pocket.\u00a0 Available with plain edge or with a combo edge in black.\nThe Snipe ($60) is another Fecas design that incorporates the first application of the McHenry and Williams designed Levitator lock to a full-sized knife. Previously used on the pint-sized Benchmite series, in this instance it acts strictly as a blade lock while open, not closed. The release is a button protruding through the middle of the left hand scale. The scales are molded plastic with a pebbled surface over stainless liners. The liner acts as the spring for the pin lock of the Levitator system.\u00a0 The long 3.97-inch (101 mm) AUS8 blade is a modified drop point, very modified (you'd be hard pressed not to call it a clip point), with thumb stud opening and a thumb rest on top. It quite thin at 0.089 inches (2.3 mm) and with a high grind ought to be a good slicer. Round, machined spacers leave an open back on the forward portion of the handle, while the rear has a stainless ridged spacer that extends out the top and back, incorporating a lanyard hole and adding to the grippability. The handle has only a hint of a half guard, along with ridged liners, up front and sweeps down at the rear with a small finger hook.\u00a0 Available in plain or combo edge and in combo edge in black.\nThe Mike Snody designed Japanese influenced Juju ($80) is very nearly a fantasy style fixed blade, and to a utility oriented guy like me, it pretty much is. The stylized, modified tanto chisel ground 440C blade is 4.75 inches (121 mm) long and a hefty 0.219-inch (5.6 mm) thick. The full tang is wrapped with black cord over red ray skin, which is certainly not subtle or nondescript. A natural colored pewter skull and bone menuki (an ornament, typically a pair, under the hilt-wrapping of a samurai style sword, mostly for decorative purposes, but it also improves grip) is restrained under the cord on the right side.\u00a0 The pommel comes to a (skull crusher) point and incorporates a lanyard hole, which is part and parcel of a series of holes that form part of the decoration for the blade. The tang incorporates both a half guard and a finger hook, so all the right practical elements are there. It comes with a very functional molded plastic sheath.\nBlue Class\nWhen Benchmade retired the well-loved Model 705 late last year, the smart money was that some sort of replacement based on the Gold Class limited edition 706 must be waiting in the wings. They were right. The Model 707 Sequel ($150) is a 705 on a Slimfast diet. Aluminum scales make for a much less bulky and lighter (2.6 oz. \u2013 74 g) knife overall, and G10 inlays provide a bit of tactile grip. A new and more robust 2.94-inch (75 mm) drop-point style blade in 154CM stainless upgrades the blade as well. The AXIS lock stays with stainless liners, as does the overall excellent ergonomics. The black coated stainless pocket clip is removable and ambidextrous, tip up carry only. It's available with plain or combo edge and also with a black blade.\nWarren Osborne's take on a gentleman's folder, the Model 440 Opportunist ($150), has sculpted aluminum scales, in a jigged bone type pattern, with wood overlays. The 2.99 inch (76 mm) S30V modified wharncliff blade presents a slim profile that is only 0.114 inches (2.9\u00a0 mm) thick. It's 3.34 inches (85 mm) closed, 0.485 inches (12.4 mm) thick and weighs in at a svelte 1.7 ounces (48 g) The liner lock is stainless with a right-hand opening stud. There's no pocket clip.\nThe expected downsized version of last year's rather large Neil Blackwood Skirmish, the Model 635 Mini-Skirmish ($200) is also a titanium framelock with a 3.43-inch (87 mm) reverse curved blade of CPM S30V in a 4.3-inch (109 mm) handle.\u00a0 Is sports the same ambidextrous thumb hole(s), but the lock and removable stainless pocket clip is set up strictly for right-handers. The bead-blasted handle decoration is a bit more subdued, with a simple spiral pattern and no brightly colored machined detents.\nOriginally a special edition for distributor Moteng International, a tanto blade style was added to the regular Griptilian line (Models 553 and 557 - $95 and $85) and the purple Mini-Grip handles are no more. A sand colored handle for the full sized Grip is now available ($105 with black combo blade), a compliment to the OD colored for those seeing service in the Middle East.\nThe Model 921 two-bladed Switchback by Osborne morphs into the all-black Model 923 ($200) with a BK1 coated black reverse tanto style combo edged CPM S30V main blade (3.4 inches \u2013 86 mm) and black anodized aluminum handles. The smaller slip-joint blade is also black coated, along with the AXIS lock and thumb studs.\nThe Snody Fixed Resistor Model 220 ($150) is a fixed blade version of the striking Resistor.\u00a0 The gotham-swedged clip point blade, plain edge only, of 154CM is 3.4 inches (86 mm) in length, actually a tad shorter than that of the folder. The full tang is scaled in black G10 with three large holes lightening things up, for an overall weight of 4.56 ounces (129 g), while adding to the handles' grippability. It is 7.45 inches (189 mm) in length overall. The sheath is molded Kydex with a leather belt loop attached.\nQuite a bit further afield design-wise is the striking new 425 Gravitator ($170), also designed by Mike Snody. The 3.5-inch (89 mm), 154CM blade is described as a \"modified wharncliff.\" While visually a bit on the wild side, it appears to be a reasonably useful working blade shape with a wharncliff's straight edge from base to tip. The handle (4.77 inches (121 mm) closed) is comprised of titanium liners with barrel back spacers and integral liner lock covered with split G10 scales. The forward piece, referred to as a \"bolster\" by Benchmade, is machined silver G10, while the aft portion is black G10, also sculpted with longitudinal furrows and two grooves matching the profile of the bolster.\u00a0 The end result is both striking and pretty ergonomic, providing a solid grip. The top of the blade is equipped with a very long thumb rest.\u00a0 While there are ambidextrous dual black thumb studs (same concentric domed ring design as the Snody Resistor), the lock and stainless pocket clip are strictly right-handed. It is set up for tip down carry. Available with plain or combo edge and either is also available with the black BK1 coating.\nBlack Class\nThe Black Class saw the addition of an Osborne designed full-tang fixed blade of generous proportions, for a Benchmade. The Model 155 Fixed Presidio ($190) has a BK1 coated blade that is 6.2 inches (157 mm) long and 0.18 inches (4.6 mm) thick. The primary edge combines a short section of very aggressive serrations at the base with an upswept clip point profile. The false edge incorporates another section of serrations, much more conventional in appearance, if not location. I suppose that calling it a false edge no longer quite works, even though most of it still it just that. Handles are black-coated aluminum with a no-slip pattern of directional ridges similar to that found on the Mel Pardue designed Presidio folder. Overall length is 11.2 inches (284 mm) and it tips the scales at 9.92 ounces (281 g).\nThe sheath is a multi-carry style black ballistic nylon unit with an insert and quick-release snapped retention strap.\u00a0 There is also a removable pocket that makes for a very nice folder or multi-tool sheath all by itself.\u00a0 Chances are you'll be able to purchase this smaller ancillary sheath separately.\nNRA Outdoors\nPursuing new markets, Benchmade has developed a new line of knives aimed expressly at the hook and bullet market, NRA Outdoors Knives, a licensed product line of the National Rifle Association. Some of the knives are made in Benchmade's factory in Oregon, others in Taiwan. You'll recognize many of the same Benchmade designers and in some cases, a definite similarity to existing knives as well as some unique new designs.\nStarting off with the folders, the Model 12700 ($65) and 12750 ($55) are Ken Steigerwalt's modern interpretations of traditional three-bladed pocketknives, 4.7 and 3.76 inches closed, respectively (119 mm and 71 mm). Both feature a clip point saber ground lockback main blade, 3.5 and\u00a0 2.8 inches (89 mm and 71 mm), respectively, and a slightly smaller modified spey/skinning blade. 3.12 and 2.5 inches (79 mm and 64 mm).\u00a0 The 12700 has a 3.12-inch (79 mm) gut hook blade and the smaller one has a can-opener and screwdriver combo in the thirds position. All the blades are 440C stainless and open with nail nicks.\u00a0 Liners are stainless and the scales are black micarta.\u00a0 The handle shape is similar to traditional canoe style, the enlarged bolster area at each end providing a bit of security and safety for the fingers.\nThe Model 12400 ($75) and 12410 ($65) are another pair of Steigerwalt lockback designs with a single one hand opening 440C stainless drop point saber ground blade, 3.4 (86 mm) and 2.7 inches (69 mm) long, respectively. They are 4.35 (110 mm) and 3.48 inches (88 mm) long closed, respectively. Liners are stainless covered with sculpted micarta scales. The satin finish stainless pocket clip is reversible; there's no lanyard hole. Available with plain or partially serrated edge.\nMel Pardue's contribution to the new line, the Model 12200 ($70), is a 3.25 inch (83 mm) modified wharncliff bladed one hand opening folder with a textured molded plastic handle.\u00a0 The handle, 4.15 inches closed (105 mm), has a curved underside, but there's not a lot of protection besides the checkering to prevent the hand from slipping onto the blade edge. The lock is\u00a0 Benchmade's Rolling Lock. The black coated pocket clip is reversible; there's a nice sized lanyard hole. Available with plain or partially serrated edge.\nWith a gun-stock shaped handle, the Steve Fecas designed Model 12300 ($29) is the value leader of this line. It has a 3.2-inch (81 mm) one hand opening drop point blade with a liner lock. The 4-inch (102 mm) long molded plastic handle has plenty of grip with its unique shape and there's a good thumb ramp as well.\u00a0 A removable pocket clip is included.\u00a0 Available with plain or partially serrated edge. There's no lanyard hole.\nWarren Osborne's influence is obvious in the lines of the Model 12800 ($170 - $180), the most striking folder in this new line. The machined anodized aluminum handles have a bidirectional waterfall pattern machined into the surface that is both attractive and that provides a very good grip, especially combined with the ergonomic shape having a pronounced finger guard and thumb ramp on the blade's spine. The ambidextrous AXIS Lock, dual thumb stud one-hand opening blade and reversible satin finish stainless split arrow pocket clip will be welcome by lefties. Steel for the uniquely styled 3.4 inches (86 mm) blade is premium 154CM stainless.\u00a0The blade shape might be described as a cross between a tanto and reverse curved drop point.\u00a0 Closed, the knife is 4.5 inches (114 mm) long. Available with plain or partially serrated edge and in a black coated partially serrated version. There's no lanyard hole.\nOf all the knives in the NRA Outdoors line, this is the one that most clearly evidences the Benchmade parentage. It's one of the best looking Osborne folders that Benchmade's done, to my eye (not that any of them are any slouch in the looks department).\u00a0 Regardless of the NRA Outdoors logo on the blade, I suspect most Benchmade Osborne blade collectors will be quick to snap this one up.\nThe line includes three practical fixed blade designs, including another by Osborne. The model 12500 ($100) is an all-around field and camp knife with a 6.25-inch (159 mm) modified drop point blade of 440C. It's got a relatively high grind, which ought to translate into a good slicer. The polished stainless guard is toped by molded Kraton rubber handle that's held in place with Benchmade's B.I.L.T. system, essentially a stainless pommel held on with a beefy socket head screw secured into a nut captured by the full hidden tang that holds the handle in place and allows for disassembly if desired for cleaning. The handle has deep rounded ribs on the lower portion.\u00a0 Unfortunately, there's no lanyard hole. The sheath is tooled leather that covers about two-thirds of the handle with a thumb-break retention strap that snaps in place.\nMike Snoody designed the 12520 ($90) with a 4-inch (102 mm) recurved drop point blade of 440C.\u00a0 There's a false edge that runs about two-thirds the way back on the spine. The full tang has Santoprene rubber overmolded scales with a very deep integral finger choil/guard. The handle incorporates added finger recesses and is very comfortable. There's a good sized lanyard hole.\u00a0 The sheath is a conventional folded ballistic nylon design with a plastic liner and a snap security strap around the handle.\nThe 4-inch (102 mm) skinner, Model 12550 ($100), is a Rick Hinderer design with lots of belly and an upswept tip. Blade steel is 440C. The full exposed tang has black stabilized wood scales that are very ergonomic. The lanyard hole in the tang is exposed by a cutout in the scales. The integral guard is deep and there are also thumb grooves on the blade's spine for added grip.\u00a0 It comes with a traditional style leather sheath with security strap.\nBoker\nFor those who find the pocket clip on a folder ruins the ergonomics or is plain old uncomfortable, Robert Voos has engineered The Boker Clip ($140), a new folder from Boker with a clip that retracts flush into the handle when the blade is opened. This lockback had sculpted aluminum handles, either plain with plain edge or black with partically serrated edge. We were never able to acertain the balde size or material.\nBoker compares the unique opening and locking mechanism of the Tic Toc to a pendulum clock, hence the name. On the right side the cast aluminum handles have a sot of lazy u-shaped slot with a button protruding through the slot.\u00a0 When closed the button sits at the forward top of the slot.\u00a0 Moving the button to the forward bottom of the slot opens the blade and locks it into position as it goes over-center. With very little practice this can be done very quickly and is more that a little bit habit forming\u0097pretty soon it does seem like a pendulum as you sit there opening and closing the knife, again and again. The opening stud is connected to the blade by an arm inside the handle, which could be a concern, only time will tell how strong this is or how well it ages in use. The 3-inch (76 mm) blade is 420 stainless, available in plain or combo edge.\nThe Helios line offers a choice of handle and blade materials, evolved from the Gemini line.\u00a0 The base model in either forest green or black hard anodizing ($165) have aluminum handles with \"cat's tongue\" inserts. Also available is a version with partially checkered rosewood handles ($165).\u00a0 The clip point blade is of X-15 T.N. stainless that is virtually unfazed by salt water or other corrosives.\u00a0 Blade length is 3.5 inches (89 mm) and overall length is 8.25 inches; they weigh in at 4.2 ounces ( g).\u00a0 The stainless pocket clip is ambidextrous and reversible for tip or tip down carry.\u00a0 The Helios Cera-Titan ($250) replaces the steel blade with a drop point made of Boker's unique Cera-Titan sintered titanium.\u00a0The handle inserts in this version are wood and the anodizing a gun metal blue.\nRatcheting up the exclusivity index, there's also a limited serialized edition with a \"Leo\" Damascus blade ($510) forged from the barrel of a Leopard main battle tank and tool steel alloy. The pattern is described at \"small pyramid.\"\u00a0 Inserts are desert ironwood.\u00a0 This is one of a number of unique Damascus steel knives Boker introduced, all of which are already spoke for at $515 to $620.\nThe Titanius ($125) combines Boker's small thin titanium handled gentleman's folder with a one hand opening Cera-Titan blade and liner lock. The drop point blade is 2.375 inches (60 mm). There's a design incised into the handle and a lanyard hole, so you end up with a very practical small lightweight and tough folder.\nNew to all the Cera-Titan line are pewter colored metal thumb disks to replace the cheap looking black plastic ones used previously.\nBuck\nShrink down Buck Knives' Alpha Hunter folder by 30% and you get the Alpha Dorado.\u00a0 Two versions with different blade steel and scales, both have a 2.5 inch (64 mm) drop point one-hand opening blade with partially exposed stainless handles and liner lock, 4 inches (102 mm) closed.\u00a0 Model 270 has a 420HC blade, charcoal birchwood scales and a ballistic nylon sheath ($64) while the Model 271 has an ATS-34 blade, rosewood scales and a leather sheath ($78). The exposed tang contains a lanyard hole; no pocket clip.\nSpeaking of the Alpha Hunter, due to customer demand, Buck now offers replacement \"SureGrip\" rubber scales to replace the wood ones on the ATS-34 bladed versions. $10 buys a complete conversion kit with the rubber handle slabs, replacement screws and an Allen wrench.\nReduce the classic Buck 110 lockback pocketknife by half and you get the aptly named \"The 55\" ($48). The clip point blade of 420HC is 2.375 inches (60 mm) long in a 3.375 inch (86 mm) handle.\u00a0 Like the original, the liner/handles are polished brass with \"natural woodgrain\" inlays. Anyone who has a fond spot for the 110 will eat this one up.\nBuck has added a white LED light to the diminutive Metro, creating the Metro LED ($27) and come up with a new model with an LED light, the Lumina ($55).\u00a0 The Metro LED has a simple on/off function and auto-off after three minutes. The Lumina has four programmed functions: High, medium and low beam and flashing, plus auto-shut off after five minutes.\nThe Metro uses the space dedicated to a bottle cap opener to house the electronics and\u00a0 two 3-volt CR-1616 batteries for the LED, which is contained in a translucent plastic handle. Same liner locked, one hand opening 1.125 inch (32 mm) blade of 420J2 steel as the original.\u00a0 It is 2.375 inches (60 mm) closed with a weight is 1.5 ounces (42 g).\nThe Lumina is also a liner lock with stainless frame and translucent plastic frame housing the electronic guts and two 3-volt CR-2032 batteries. The partially serrated blade is 3 inches (76 mm) of 420HC stainless with a one hand opening slot. 4.375 inches (110 mm) closed, the tail of one liner is exposed and forms a large lanyard hole.\u00a0 All up it weighs in at 3.6 ounces (102 g). The LED is offset to the left on the Lumina and aimed down at the blade, lighting what you may be cutting.\u00a0 If you're going to add a light to a knife, that seems to us like how it ought to work.\nOn both models the On/off switch is a rubber-covered button on the side. The lights are water resistant.\u00a0 Battery change requires a small screwdriver on the Lumina, but none is required for the Metro LED.\u00a0 We have no run time numbers for the lights.\nThe Code 3 CrossLock ($42), developed for emergency personnel use, replaces the saw blade of the Alpha CrossLock PBS with a 3-inch (76 mm) serrated sheepsfoot blade of 420 HC. This is paired with the existing 3-inch (76 mm) drop point blade in the unique double liner lock aluminum frame. The frame is available in anodized gray or red.\u00a0 Red is definitely the way to go, take my word on this. A ballistic nylon sheath is included.\nTom Mayo has designed another series of folders for Buck, the Cutback ($44) and Hilo ($50).\u00a0 Both are satin finish frame locks with a contoured stainless steel frame, drilled with a single line of Mayo's signature lightening holes down the center.\u00a0 A wee bit of flare at the forward end may keep your fingers off the sharp edge of the blade. The one hand opening drop point blade is of 440C stainless, 3.25 inches (83 mm) and 3.625 (91 mm) long, respectively, with a little bit of recurve to it. Overall length and weight is 4.125 inches (104 mm) and 3.3 ounces (92 g)\u00a0 and 4.5 inches (114 mm) and 4 ounces (114 g). The removable clip is also stainless; there's no lanyard hole.\nIn an attempt to keep them affordable, Buck is reproducing some of its classic slipjoint pocketknives in China.\u00a0 For example, the new model 371 Stockman (3.875 inches (98 mm) closed) with three blades of 440C is $28 versus the original made-in-the-USA 301 Stockman, which is $43 with 420HC blades. While the original has black plastic scales, these have Paca wood.\u00a0 Bolsters are still nickel silver with brass liners and the classic Hammer and Bolt Buck logo inlay. Also being produced is a mid-sized 373 Trio (3.25 inches \u2013 83 mm) three blader ($24), a two bladed 375 Deuce (2.625 inches - 67 mm)($20) and a 3-inch (76 mm) single blade folder, the 379 Solo ($15).\u00a0 Buck is standing behind these knives with their \"4-Ever Warranty\" and insists they are being built to strict quality standards.\nColumbia River Knife & Tool\nColumbia River Knife & Tool was aggressively promoting their new Merlin quick deployment sheath\u00a0that was designed by Michael Martinez. This unique patented concept allows for the folder to be carried in a variety of positions and when pulled from the sheath it automatically deploys.\u00a0 Somewhat akin the Emerson's Wave concept as it deploys from a pocket, but working with virtually any medium to large folder, the Merlin sheath provide very quick deployment without the need to manually open the blade. While it didn't take long to learn the basics of how to use it with the designer demonstrating the system, for the rest of us it comes with an instruction book, 52 pages worth for the \"Professional\" model ($35) with a multitude of carry and deployment options or a smaller 18 page manual for the \"Sport & Work\" model ($30) which covers only a few more traditional belt carry modes.\nAutomatic opening or assisted opening knives need not apply, but most others will work, including traditional folders without one-hand opening. The listed parameters are as follows: Blade Length between 2.5 inches (64 mm) and 5 inches (127 mm); Maximum Blade Thickness of 0.25 inches (6.3 mm), Maximum Blade Width of 1.5 inches (38 mm); Maximum Knife Weight of 8 ounces (227 g) and a Blade Channel Width (the space between the liners) between 0.125 inches (3 mm) and 0.1875 inches 5 mm).\nThe clip is designed to clip into a pocket or waistband, etc., or onto a belt or shoulder strap up to two inches (51 mm) wide.\u00a0 The point of the blade is inserted into a recess in the sheath with a sliding wedge to ensure it is a tight fit. The handle is then folded over and closed on an ear on the side of the sheath wedging it as tightly as possible.\u00a0 Once in place it is fairly well secured and takes a strong jerk to pull it loose, it isn't going to fall out or be easily dislodged. With the knife in place, this can leave a small portion of the blade exposed, which might imperil a small finger, so best not to use this around curious or clingy young children if your knife is one of those that does so. Some knives we tried covered virtually all the blade edge.\nThe sheath rotates into eight positions in relation to the clip and locks in place with a neoprene o-ring and screw . The clip is very secure. As you pull the knife handle the sheath rotates as necessary (up to 45 degrees) to allow the blade to come loose, automagically deploying it into the fully open, and if equipped with a blade lock, locked position. It does work as advertised; we took a sample home and tried it on a variety of knives and from numerous carry locations.\u00a0 If there's a notable drawback to the concept, it is that the same features that make this quick draw sheath so easy to deploy from also leave your knife exposed such that it could be grabbed by someone else. For some potential uses, especially for law enforcement personnel, that may be a concern.\u00a0 In addition, it most definitely is not sheeple friendly.\nThe Merlin II ($50) is a somewhat similar concept for fixed blades . It resembles a conventional rigid molded plastic sheath in most respects, but incorporates the rotating positioning system like that used on the Merlin but limited to 45 degrees and also includes the same strong clip.\u00a0 The bottom of the sheath is modular and exchangeable to accommodate different length blades.\u00a0 The standard cap holds blades up to 4.8 inches (122 mm). Four alternative caps ($7 to $10) accommodate blade lengths of 5.4 inches (137 mm) to 8.4 inches (213 mm) in one inch (25.4 mm) increments.\u00a0 Maximum blade thickness is 0.22 inches (5.5 mm) and blade width is from 0.72 inches (18 mm) to 1.65 inches (42 mm).\nThe blade is held in place by a curved spring that presses against the blade which in turn is lodged against two \"rails on the inside of the exterior wall of the sheath.\"\u00a0 At least that's how CRK&T explains it, they didn't have a sample for us to examine.\u00a0 There's also an ancillary thumb break strap to go around the handle for added security, if desired.\nAlso introduced was a Michael Martinez designed fixed blade, dubbed the Ultima ($120).\u00a0 While the blade is a conventional clip point of \"1.4116\" stainless steel (a German steel with performance similar to 440A according to CRK&T), 6.75 inches long, the handle is anything but conventional. Designed based on input from a panel of medical specialists including ergonomic experts, kinesthesiologists and a surgical tool designer, it incorporates 22 of the 23 \"points of contact\" in the hand that were determined as being the ideal handle by these experts.\nWhether this is real science or voodoo, the result is definitely different. It was difficult to tell how good a grip was to be had, both because of limited time to play with it and also because the prototype samples' scales had wire cut edges that were very sharp and gripping tightly was just plain uncomfortable due to this.\u00a0 There are lots of edges as the molded Zytel handle is comprised of a series of \"over 70\" triangular shapes with channels between them .\u00a0 These channels, referred to as sipes (a term usually used in reference to tire design) or \"ooze grooves,\" are designed to channel away mud, water and blood to ensure a good grip even in these difficult environments. Anyone who has seen video of a tire channeling away water to prevent hydroplaning will understand this concept.\nThe full tang extends out the back into a pry bar shape that also serves as a hook to help maintain a grip. Up front the scales expand to form a ramped full guard.\u00a0 The scales partially cover the top and bottom of the tang , so there's no contact with the metal, a feature we like.\u00a0 The blade is available with or without a small serrated section at the base of the blade and both have a bead blast finish. Overall length is 11.625 inches (295 mm) and it weighs in at 9.4 ounces (266 g).\nWe found it in intriguing that the standard sheath for this knife isn't the Merlin II , but rather is a traditional ballistic nylon tactical sheath with storage pocket.\nThe Van Hoy Snap Lock is now joined by a smaller sibling, the Snap Lock 2 ($50) with a 1.75 inch (44 mm) blade, 3 inches (76 mm) closed and 4.375 inches (111 mm) open. Same ambidextrous opening and closing with the unique Snap Lock and the blade steel is again AUS 4.\nA new Van Hoy design, the Snap Fire ($90) with yet another new lock design that is very eye-catching.\u00a0 The lock incorporates a large a stainless steel wheel with \"specteral titanium nitride coating\" and small serrations around the circumference. One hand opening is accomplished by rotating this wheel.\u00a0 A\u00a0 compression lock secures the 2.375 inch (60 mm) AUS 8 drop point blade in place.\u00a0 A safety, which operates like the LAWKS we've seen on most CRK&T liner locks, can be used to ensure the lock doesn't disengage inadvertently.\nClosing the blade is where things get a little weird.\u00a0 You press down on that stainless wheel to disengage the lock, which actually moves the blade pivot away from the lock allowing the blade to be closed by rotating the wheel.\u00a0 It's a whole lot easier to do than to describe.\nThe single-sided frame of the knife is gray anodized aluminum withy large cut-out, creating a skeletonized look.\u00a0 A curvaceous stainless steel bade guard protects the blade on one side, mirroring the removable pocket clip on the other side.\u00a0 Available in plain or combo edge.\nThe Side Hawg ($30), designed by Mike Franklin, takes the side blades used on the Serengeti folder to the logical endpoint, getting rid of the folder.\u00a0 The single edge grind blade of 420J2 stainless rides flat against the Zytel \"sheath plate,\" held in place by a stud and spring clip.\u00a0 The knife itself is 4.375 (111 mm) overall with a 0.12 inch (3 mm) thick skeletonized handle and a skinner style blade with a 1.625 inch (41 mm) cutting edge.\u00a0 There's a deep guard/choil and ridges on the top for thumb purchase. The whole package is 5.375 inches (137 mm) long, weighs 2.6 ounces (81 g), and it comes with a nylon strap and carabiner attached to the lanyard hole.\nThe Signature Hunter Series ($60) are three fixed blades with full tangs and bamboo scales, designed by Russ Kommer. The blades are 1.4116 stainless and there is a drop point, clip point and skinner with a gut hook. Blade length is 3.25 inches (83 mm),\u00a0 3.5 inches (89 mm) and 3.25 inches (83 mm) respectively, overall length is 7.879 inches (200 mm), 7.25 inches (184 mm) and 7.625 inches (194 mm), respectively. The blades have a very high hollow grind.\u00a0 A deep finger choil/ half guard with friction groves and thumb rest with same provide a good grip. The tang extends beyond the scales and there's an ample lanyard slot.\u00a0 The fitted leather sheath is very nice with perimeter tooling and burnished edges.\nTwo new Pat & Wes Crawford assisted opening designs, the Voodoo and Wild Weasel (both $130), are both their first assisted opening blades and the first knives produced in the U.S by CRK&T. Scales are hard anodized gray aluminum with stainless liners, dual thumb studs, and ambidextrous pocket clip. The blades are 154CM stainless, bead blasted and available with either plain or combo edge.\u00a0 The scales have black Santoprene inserts. The Wild Weasel has a drop point blade with a thumb ramp and long false edge. The Voodoo blade is a spear point with three graduated holes in the spine.\u00a0 Neither knife is equipped with a lanyard hole.\nKnife sharpening remains a mystery to many knife owners. At best they end up with a blade that is less dull, sometimes the blade is ruined and many won't even try, relying on professionals or sending the knife back to the factory. It's a practiced skill that simply has fallen into disuse. The simple systems require a fair amount to considerable skill to use and/or too use without ruining the blade and the guided system approach doesn't lend itself to being set up and used easily and quickly. As for powered systems; let's not even go there. CRK&T's new Slide Sharp ($35) is sort of the Dummies Guide of knife sharpeners, developed by Steve McCowen and Charles Kain.\nThis is one of those forehead slapping, why-didn't-I-think-of-this concepts.\u00a0 A 9.45 inch (240 mm) long ceramic rod\u00a0 is inserted into a wood base a few inches square. The kit comes with 2 ceramic rods, fine and course.\u00a0 You then drop a spring over the rod and then a plastic guide that has two slots in it, each at a different angle to the rod.\u00a0 Finally, there's a small domed handhold to go on top of the rod.\u00a0 Hold the rod steady with one hand at the top and simply slip the knife into the slot and run the guide down the rod while pulling the knife through.\u00a0 Release and the guide pops up again for another pass.\u00a0 Switch the blade direction in the guide to do the other side of the blade.\nThe current guide has a \"fine\" and \"utility\" setting, 17 and 21 degrees (nobody seems to know how they came to select those odd angles), but others will eventually be available and it wouldn't be all that difficult to make your own.\u00a0 It is all packed in a plastic box.\u00a0 We're hopeful; they'll come up with a field sharpener using the same concept, but which will pack into a much smaller box.\nA smaller version of the titanium handled M16, model M16-01T ($110), has been added with a 3.125 inch (79 mm) spear point AUS 8 blade.\nChris Reeve\nAnother Bill Harsey fixed blade design, Neil Roberts Warrior Knife ($329) is being produced by Chris Reeve , this a commemorative blade commissioned by Navy Chief Steven Bronson in honor of Petty Office First Class Neil Roberts, killed in action during Operation anaconda in Afghanistan in 2002, the first SEAL to loose his life in action since 1989. Roberts graduated from SEAL Class #184 and that number of serialized and specially engraved knives have been set aside for the SEAL community.\nIf you're not a SEAL, you can still get one, minus the serial number and engraving, but otherwise identical. The 6-inch (152 mm) S30V drop point plain edged blade is KG Gun-Kote coated, like the rest of Chris' fixed blades. Overall length is 11 inches (279 mm) and weight is 12.3 ounces (349 g). Handle slabs are sandblasted black canvas micarta. The handle incorporates an angled full guard and deep finger scallop and the requisite lanyard hole. There's a finger choil ahead of the guard. Sheath is a tan Combat Master by Spec-Ops. I like this one better than the Harsey designed Green Beret knives, it has my favorite blade shape, no serrations and it's just the right size.\nA trust fund has been established to support the education of Neil Robert's son, Nathan. Twenty dollars from each knife purchase is contributed to this fund ( click for more information on the Neil Roberts Memorial Project )\nChris also came out with a spear point version of the Nkonka, which is otherwise identical to the original, having the tool kit in the hollow handle.\nGerber\nGerber's LMF II is available in two versions, the ASEK (Aircrew Survival Egress Knife) ($120) and the Infantry(??). The only difference is that the ASEK comes with a Safety Knife for cutting seat belts and parachute shrouds. This is also available separately ($??). The LMF II is 10.59 inches (269 mm) overall length with a black coated stout clip point 4.84-inch (123 mm) blade of 12C 27 Sandvik steel. The knife weighs 11.4 ounces (323 g). The blade is approximately 50% serrated. The overmolded Hytrel rubber handle incorporates a double guard and the same design technology as the Silver Trident with the pommel/butt cap separated from the tang, isolating it completely. That butt cap incorporates both a robust pointed plexigalss/canopy breaker and a hammerhead designed to be used with the knife held in its sheath, as well as a large lanyard hole. The guard is pierced with holes and the handle has a depression to leave room for a a shaft to allow the knife to be used as a spear, though why anyone would want to is beyond us. That's just a good way to lose your second most important survival tool. You probably already lost your first if you try this trick.\nThe sheath has a soft rubber overmolding on the main molded plastic sheath body to cut down on noise. The plastic sheath is attached to a ballistic nylon upper portion with straps and it is equipped for a variety of carry modes. It is fully compatible with the MOLE system with straps required included, or can just be hung on your belt. It comes with Fastek style buckle-equipped straps for leg or calf attachment. There are double snapped retention straps around the handle and slots and holes in the sheath for about any sort of attachment means you could imagine. It is claimed to be suitable for parachuting, which we don't doubt. The sheath incorporates a removeable pull-though carbide sharpener attached on the face of the sheath body, about as easy to use as possible, no skill required. Both the handle and sheath are dark tan in color, the ballistic nylon is brown.\nThe Safety Knife is pretty much your standard seat belt cutter with a slotted double razor blade cutter molded into a plastic handle. It requires its own separate ballistic nylon sheath with a Velcro retained flap.\nGerber's latest entry in the multi-tool warts is the Diesel Multi-Plier ($90), which is more or less a buffed-up version of their Multiplier. It retains the same basic operation with one-hand opening sliding pliers and the like. This is a needlenose design with the pliers' jaws being substantially bulked up compared to the original for added strength. There's a much longer wire cutter section incorporated into the pliers.\nAll the blades and tools lock with somewhat larger overmolded lock releases. The tools seem a bit beefer as well, though don't have exact measurements. The knife blade is a sort of tanto-esque design, 50% serrated. A double-row wood saw mimics this same shape. This is a dedicated saw blade, not the universal saw coupler that accepted jigsaw blades as used in some previous Multi-Pliers. The scissors have longer blades and appear to be better designed so they won't as easily jam in the cut like all th eothers Gerber has.\nThere's also a metal/wood file, can opener, three flat screwdrivers, Phillips driver and a lanyard loop. They eliminated the solderless terminal crimper between the handles of the standard Multi-Pliers, which we hate to see go away. A ballistic nylon sheath is included.\nMessing with a classic can be risky, but the new Gator II folders are a definite big step up (then originals will still be available). Still a lockback with their trademark tacky rubber grip, they now have a one hand opening blade, via a slot in the blade. The 4.49 inch (114 mm) handle has an added finger scallop, three total now, with ridges in the handle top and bottom. The 3.70-inch drop point blade of ??? stainless has a lot of belly and a ridged thumb rest. It is available in both plain and partially serrated edge. There's also a version with a gut hook in the spine, also with plain or partially serrated options. There's also a lanyard hole, which the original lacked, and it all weighs in at 3.4 ounces (96 g). Includes a thermoformed ballistic nylon sheath.\nThe Gator Exchange-A-Blade Saw takes the original excellent Exchange-A-Blade Saw and beefs it up with a Gator Grip molded handle, easier to operate top lock and a bit bigger blade. The saw is 8.78 inches (223 mm) closed and the blades are 6.65 inches (169 mm) long. This compares to 8.19 inches (208 mm) and 6.18 inches (157 mm) for the original (which is still available).\nI'll have to try this saw out to see how well the grippier Gator handle works in heavy use. Without gloves my concern would be that it could create hot spots and blisters. Sawing is not the same as using a knife. I do like that they have also added a lanyard hole. As before, they offer it with only one blade or with both a fine/bone saw and coarse/wood saw. With the two-bladed combination you get a ballistic nylon sheath.\nGerber's joined the assisted opening club with the Fast Draw ($60) using \"Forward Action Spring Technology.\" You've just got to wonder how many brain cells bite the dust as these knife company marketing types try to come up with trademarkable and catchy acronyms for their designs. In any case, custom maker Butch Vallotton, well known for his automatic knives, designed this patented opening mechanism. The 3.25 inch (83 mm) drop point 440 stainless blade has an opening stud or a small flipper poking through the top of the handle to start things opening. It takes only a little movement. The slide safety located in the side of the left scale also serves to release the lock to allow the blade to close. Closed, the Fast Draw is 4.19 inches (106 mm) with a patterned Zytel handle. Available in plain or partially serrated edge, there's no lanyard hole.\nHeckler & Koch\nHK introduced a well-rounded line of fixed blades and folding knives, all designed by Mike Snoody and produced by Benchmade. The HK34 AXIS Tactical Folder and Auto models ($220 and $258) are available with either a tactical drop point blade or a radical tanto style. The 3.4-inch (86 mm) blades are 154CM and have a high thumb ramp rising over the dual thumb studs. The partial liners are stainless to secure the AXIS Lock inlaid into cast aluminum handles having an overmolded Zytel overlay on the aft portion of the handle.\u00a0 The result is an appearance of an aluminum bolster, but it is all integrated. Overall length open is 8.19 inches (208 mm) and the weight is 5.6 ounces (159 g).\nIn the AXIS Tactical, both blades are available in plain or combo partially serrated edge with the drop point plain edge and tanto combo edge also available with black Zytel coating.\u00a0 The Auto is available only in combo edge with the black coating. There's no lanyard hole, but the black pocket clip is reversible.\nThe KN30 Liner Lock ($110) one hand opener has stainless liners with overmolded black Zytel handles patterned similarly to the HK34 series, but with a deep finger choil/guard. The 2.97-inch (75 mm) satin finish blade is N690 stainless in a clip point recurved shape with a wide false edge that extends all the way back to the low-rise thumb ramp.\u00a0 Overall length is 6.84 inches (174 mm).\u00a0 There's a removable black pocket clip, but no lanyard hole. Available in plain or combo edge.\nThe HK36 Tactical Fixed Blade ($150) has a 3.62-inch (92 mm) broad recurved hollow ground plain edged blade of 440C stainless. The spine has a short section of false edge, then two scallops followed by a long grooved thumb rest, resulting in a distinctive profile.\u00a0 Three holes drilled in the blade spine add another decorative element. The black molded Zytel scales have three scalloped cutouts that reveal the full tang, each with three small decorative drilled dimples. The finger choil/half guard is deep for security.\u00a0 There's a lanyard hole in the butt with an included braided lanyard and it slips into a molded and riveted Zytel sheath. The blade is 0.150 inches (3.8 mm) thick and the knife is 7.62 inches (194 mm) overall and weighs 4.3 ounces (122 g).\nThe 5-inch (127 mm) fixed blade continues the length-derived naming as the HK50 Tactical Fixed Blade ($198). The straightforward drop point blade is of 440C with a black Xylan coating and 60/40 partially serrated combo edge. The false edge extends well back on the spine and the prominent thumb ramp extends well forward. The scales attached to the full tang are multilayered G10 for a unique look, with the outer layer machined with lots of tactile grooves for a good grip. There are two deep finger scallops and a rounded butt with a lanyard hole. Sheath is a typical ambidextrous Cordura nylon tactical style with a storage pocket having a Velcro'd flap.\nKershaw\nKershaw's primary designer, Ken Onion, collaborated with Frank Centofante to create the Centofante-Onion, which is available with two handle materials.\u00a0 The Model 1610 ($70) has anodized red aluminum handles with a curvy design machined into them and the Model 1615 ($100) has polished stainless steel handles coated with black Tungsten DLC coating. The handles have three graduated round recesses at the rear of the handle inlaid with genuine pearl. It adds a touch of class, especially to the 1615 where the pearl and DLC coating really compliment each other nicely. Both Kershaw's SpeedSafe assisted opening mechanism, stainless liners and liner lock and are equipped with a Centofante inspired wharncliff blade of 440A stainless, 2.25 inches (57 mm) long.\u00a0 Closed the knives are 3 1/8 inches (79 mm).\u00a0 The 1610 weighs 1.6 ounces (45 g) including a removable pocket clip; the 1615 weighs 2.4 ounces (68 g) and has a leather sheath with clip.\nThe Mini MOJO ($100) is another Ken Onion SpeedSafe assisted opener with a newly patented Stud Lock . This ambidextrous lock incorporate the dual opening studs (which aren't the primary opening mechanism on these and most other Kershaws, they are equipped with Ken Onion's original flipper design incorporated into the blade) as the lock. The studs are spring loaded with a compression spring and slide fore and aft in a slot in the blade. When the blade is fully open, they lock back into a recess in the forward top part of the handle. The lock is self-adjusting due to a slight ramp in this recess. Simply moving the studs forward releases the blade. We have some concerns upon our limited\u00a0 examination that this could be pretty easily done inadvertently, compromising the blade lock's utility and safety.\u00a0 We'll have a better idea if this is an issue after we receive a sample to field test.\nThe handles are stainless with a satin finish and a large G-10 insert.\u00a0 The handle incorporates a prominent guard and finger hook and is equipped with a lanyard hole. That guard and oversized flipper may help to counteract the potential of inadvertent release of the lock; they will close on the finger which would prevent the blade from closing, though we're not sure that's the best solution.\nThe 440A stainless recurved blade is 2 3/8 inches (61 mm) long and closed the Mojo measures 3.5 inches (89 mm). There's a prominent false edge and thumb ramp. It's a hefty knife for its size at 3.1 ounces (?g).\nKershaw shrunk the Ken Onion designed Boa into the Baby Boa ($75), though you have to look closely to see the family resemblance because this baby is pretty dolled up compared to the original's tactical look.\u00a0 It has full stainless liners and liner lock with partial aluminum scales, anodized with a red with black smoked finish, that allow the drilled liners to peek out from behind for a unique look. A cutout in the left scale provides a view of the torsion bar spring that drives the assisted opening. There's a lanyard hole at the rear. The SpeedSafe assisted opening recurved blade is 440A, 2 inches (51 mm) long.\u00a0 Closed, it is 2.75 inches (70 mm) long. It weighs in at 1.7 ounces (48 g).\u00a0 For those who liked the size of the Chive, but not the very narrow tip, the baby Boa will be a welcome alternative.\u00a0 Now they just need to add some more elegant finishes.\nA new Ken Onion fixed blade design, the Outcast ($100), is a large bolo style blade, sort of Kershaw's answer to the BK&T Brute. The blade is 10 inches (254 mm) of titanium nitride coated D2 steel. The signature style Ken Onion handle is Santoprene rubber overmolded on top of glass-filled nylon. Incorporated into the handle si a very deep half guard and the handle swells at the top as well. Overall, the Outcast is 16 inches (406 mm) long and weighs 22 ounces (624 g). The molded Kydex sheath includes a security strap for added insurance.\nWhile it hit the market shortly before SHOT Show, this was out first opportunity to sample the Two Can ($30).\u00a0 This small executive folder combines a knife blade and scissors in a unique manner. There is a one hand opening chisel ground wharncliff blade, non-locking, of 420 stainless, 1.5 inches (35 mm) long. Open the second blade that lies alongside the first using a nail nick and you have a very functional pair of scissors for light cutting.\u00a0 In this configuration, you squeeze the scissors blades directly.\u00a0 The handles are stainless, 2.75 inches (70 mm) closed, and incorporate a small carabinier clip on the tail end which would do fine to hold keys and the like.\u00a0 It seems like this would be a perfect tool for an office setting.\nLeatherman\nThe emphasis at Leatherman this year was big--really big.\u00a0 Huge might be a better description. The new Core ($78) and Surge ($102) multi-tools are the largest ever offered by the company, and arguably the biggest folding tools with full\u2013sized pliers available anywhere (the previous heavyweight was the Victorinox SwissTool).\nThe Core weighs in at 10.2 ounces (289 g), or 13.2% more than the Super Tool 200 it replaces and 0.2 oz (6 g) more than the SwissTool. That translates into larger implements with greater strength and reach.\nThe Surge is more or less a Wave on steroids---lots of steroids! At 12.2 ounces (346 g), all included, it is 35.5% heavier than the Super Tool 200, 21.6% more than the new Core and a whopping 43.5% more than the Wave. Looking at it another way, the Surge tips the scales at just over three-quarters of a pound. And, that's even before adding the weight of the sheath, 1.2 oz (34 g) for nylon or 2 oz. (57 g) for leather. Only real men and amazons need apply.\nBoth tools are 4.5 inches (114 mm) in length, closed, same as the Super Tool. The Core is 0.75\" inch (21.3 mm) thick; the Surge is 0.781 inch (22.1 mm) thick.\nHere's a table comparing the blades and implements included in the two new tools:\n"}, {"score": 719.9083, "uuid": "9a308bda-31c4-546d-b004-8694dc8a6bb2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0008wb-53-03200", "target_hostname": "equipped.org", "target_uri": "http://equipped.org/shot_show_2005_knives.htm", "page_rank": 1.1847532e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "SHOT Show 2005 Report - <em>Knives</em> - EQUIPPED TO SURVIVE", "snippet": "This is one of those forehead slapping, why-didn&#x27;t-<em>I</em>-think-of-this concepts.

", "explanation": null, "document": "SHOT Show 2005 Report - Knives\nT\nhis was the year of the \"II.\" Lots of old classics were updated with better materials or details. We also saw more blades of premium CPM S30V steel, though for the most part it is still seen primarily in more high-end knives. There was no shortage of new and innovative designs, but the large hole left by Schrade's bankruptcy late last year saw many manufacturers pursuing the traditional slipjoint pocketknife market that was their mainstay, and which in the view of many, was a big part of their downfall.\u00a0 It is certainly clear that any knife company that rests on their laurels and fails to innovate and aggressively pursue the fickle consumer with a clear vision and 20/20 insight into their markets is likely doomed.\nWe saw a good deal more knives being produced in China for major manufacturers as they search for lower cost production. The Chinese are quick studies and they are realizing there's money to be made producing quality cutlery, not just the crap for which they have been known up to now. It won't take them long to equal the best Taiwan and Japan can produce, which can be very good indeed.\nThe knives covered here are those that are appropriate for wilderness survival use or which otherwise were of interest to me.\u00a0 This is not an all-inclusive coverage of every knife introduced at the show.\u00a0 Moreover, some manufacturers decline to make appointments and in some cases were not covered since we were unable to sit down and review the new product with them. Others failed to get us promised images of their new products in time. We'll try to get those up if and when they show. (By and large, we no longer photograph knives at the show if we're told images are available; just not enough hours in the day anymore and we're not to the point where we can afford a photographer to follow us around.)\nWe have provided the specifications we received from the manufacturers for the most part; some are much better than others in what they provide, so blame them if you are missing some spec you'd have liked to have seen.\nPlease note that due to unexpected duties involving the development of new standards for emergency beacons that are a result of our findings last year of problems in this area , necessitating a trip to Washington, D.C. right after SHOT Show and now to London for a week, time to compile the Knives portion of this report has been limited. I do hope to add more companies and their wares when I get back. Thanks for your understanding.\nPrices quoted are manufacturer's suggested retail price as of February, 2005 (we don't waste bytes, or your intelligence, on 95 cents, we just round up). Most knives and tools covered here can be purchased at significantly discounted prices from those quoted. In some cases, items will not be available until much later this year.\n(Disclaimer: Editor Doug Ritter, author of this SHOT Show cutlery review, is currently collaborating with Benchmade Knife Company on a series of knives and may in the future collaborate with other manufacturers included in this report.)\nAssembling this SHOT Show Report is a major undertaking for this one-man show.

It is a \"proprietary poly-ceramic coating\" which is claimed to exceed ASTM-117 specification for saltwater corrosion resistance and is purported to be more scratch resistant than previous Benchmade coatings.\nRed Class\nBenchmade's popular priced Red Class line introduced last year, mostly made in Taiwan, was flushed out with three new offerings. Steve Fecas designed the largest knife in the current Benchmade line, a 13-inch (330 mm) long fixed blade with a 7.13 inch (181 mm) spear point blade of 0.219-inch (5.6 mm) thick 440C. It weighs in at 12.58 ounces (356 g). The Offsider ($100) has a very wide false edge extending about two-thirds the way back which provides significant relief to what would otherwise be a pretty massive looking blade. Instead, it makes for an almost slim appearance. Molded textured plastic scales cover most of the full tang, including an integral full guard, with the exception of about a quarter-inch of the tail end, which also incorporates a lanyard hole. The tang curves downward to the rear and also incorporates ridges fore and aft, top and bottom for improved grip. The sheath is a conventional black ballistic nylon with liner and a front pocket.\u00a0 Available with plain edge or with a combo edge in black.\nThe Snipe ($60) is another Fecas design that incorporates the first application of the McHenry and Williams designed Levitator lock to a full-sized knife. Previously used on the pint-sized Benchmite series, in this instance it acts strictly as a blade lock while open, not closed. The release is a button protruding through the middle of the left hand scale. The scales are molded plastic with a pebbled surface over stainless liners. The liner acts as the spring for the pin lock of the Levitator system.\u00a0 The long 3.97-inch (101 mm) AUS8 blade is a modified drop point, very modified (you'd be hard pressed not to call it a clip point), with thumb stud opening and a thumb rest on top. It quite thin at 0.089 inches (2.3 mm) and with a high grind ought to be a good slicer. Round, machined spacers leave an open back on the forward portion of the handle, while the rear has a stainless ridged spacer that extends out the top and back, incorporating a lanyard hole and adding to the grippability. The handle has only a hint of a half guard, along with ridged liners, up front and sweeps down at the rear with a small finger hook.\u00a0 Available in plain or combo edge and in combo edge in black.\nThe Mike Snody designed Japanese influenced Juju ($80) is very nearly a fantasy style fixed blade, and to a utility oriented guy like me, it pretty much is. The stylized, modified tanto chisel ground 440C blade is 4.75 inches (121 mm) long and a hefty 0.219-inch (5.6 mm) thick. The full tang is wrapped with black cord over red ray skin, which is certainly not subtle or nondescript. A natural colored pewter skull and bone menuki (an ornament, typically a pair, under the hilt-wrapping of a samurai style sword, mostly for decorative purposes, but it also improves grip) is restrained under the cord on the right side.\u00a0 The pommel comes to a (skull crusher) point and incorporates a lanyard hole, which is part and parcel of a series of holes that form part of the decoration for the blade. The tang incorporates both a half guard and a finger hook, so all the right practical elements are there. It comes with a very functional molded plastic sheath.\nBlue Class\nWhen Benchmade retired the well-loved Model 705 late last year, the smart money was that some sort of replacement based on the Gold Class limited edition 706 must be waiting in the wings. They were right. The Model 707 Sequel ($150) is a 705 on a Slimfast diet. Aluminum scales make for a much less bulky and lighter (2.6 oz. \u2013 74 g) knife overall, and G10 inlays provide a bit of tactile grip. A new and more robust 2.94-inch (75 mm) drop-point style blade in 154CM stainless upgrades the blade as well. The AXIS lock stays with stainless liners, as does the overall excellent ergonomics. The black coated stainless pocket clip is removable and ambidextrous, tip up carry only. It's available with plain or combo edge and also with a black blade.\nWarren Osborne's take on a gentleman's folder, the Model 440 Opportunist ($150), has sculpted aluminum scales, in a jigged bone type pattern, with wood overlays. The 2.99 inch (76 mm) S30V modified wharncliff blade presents a slim profile that is only 0.114 inches (2.9\u00a0 mm) thick. It's 3.34 inches (85 mm) closed, 0.485 inches (12.4 mm) thick and weighs in at a svelte 1.7 ounces (48 g) The liner lock is stainless with a right-hand opening stud. There's no pocket clip.\nThe expected downsized version of last year's rather large Neil Blackwood Skirmish, the Model 635 Mini-Skirmish ($200) is also a titanium framelock with a 3.43-inch (87 mm) reverse curved blade of CPM S30V in a 4.3-inch (109 mm) handle.\u00a0 Is sports the same ambidextrous thumb hole(s), but the lock and removable stainless pocket clip is set up strictly for right-handers. The bead-blasted handle decoration is a bit more subdued, with a simple spiral pattern and no brightly colored machined detents.\nOriginally a special edition for distributor Moteng International, a tanto blade style was added to the regular Griptilian line (Models 553 and 557 - $95 and $85) and the purple Mini-Grip handles are no more. A sand colored handle for the full sized Grip is now available ($105 with black combo blade), a compliment to the OD colored for those seeing service in the Middle East.\nThe Model 921 two-bladed Switchback by Osborne morphs into the all-black Model 923 ($200) with a BK1 coated black reverse tanto style combo edged CPM S30V main blade (3.4 inches \u2013 86 mm) and black anodized aluminum handles. The smaller slip-joint blade is also black coated, along with the AXIS lock and thumb studs.\nThe Snody Fixed Resistor Model 220 ($150) is a fixed blade version of the striking Resistor.\u00a0 The gotham-swedged clip point blade, plain edge only, of 154CM is 3.4 inches (86 mm) in length, actually a tad shorter than that of the folder. The full tang is scaled in black G10 with three large holes lightening things up, for an overall weight of 4.56 ounces (129 g), while adding to the handles' grippability. It is 7.45 inches (189 mm) in length overall. The sheath is molded Kydex with a leather belt loop attached.\nQuite a bit further afield design-wise is the striking new 425 Gravitator ($170), also designed by Mike Snody. The 3.5-inch (89 mm), 154CM blade is described as a \"modified wharncliff.\" While visually a bit on the wild side, it appears to be a reasonably useful working blade shape with a wharncliff's straight edge from base to tip. The handle (4.77 inches (121 mm) closed) is comprised of titanium liners with barrel back spacers and integral liner lock covered with split G10 scales. The forward piece, referred to as a \"bolster\" by Benchmade, is machined silver G10, while the aft portion is black G10, also sculpted with longitudinal furrows and two grooves matching the profile of the bolster.\u00a0 The end result is both striking and pretty ergonomic, providing a solid grip. The top of the blade is equipped with a very long thumb rest.\u00a0 While there are ambidextrous dual black thumb studs (same concentric domed ring design as the Snody Resistor), the lock and stainless pocket clip are strictly right-handed. It is set up for tip down carry. Available with plain or combo edge and either is also available with the black BK1 coating.\nBlack Class\nThe Black Class saw the addition of an Osborne designed full-tang fixed blade of generous proportions, for a Benchmade. The Model 155 Fixed Presidio ($190) has a BK1 coated blade that is 6.2 inches (157 mm) long and 0.18 inches (4.6 mm) thick. The primary edge combines a short section of very aggressive serrations at the base with an upswept clip point profile. The false edge incorporates another section of serrations, much more conventional in appearance, if not location. I suppose that calling it a false edge no longer quite works, even though most of it still it just that. Handles are black-coated aluminum with a no-slip pattern of directional ridges similar to that found on the Mel Pardue designed Presidio folder. Overall length is 11.2 inches (284 mm) and it tips the scales at 9.92 ounces (281 g).\nThe sheath is a multi-carry style black ballistic nylon unit with an insert and quick-release snapped retention strap.\u00a0 There is also a removable pocket that makes for a very nice folder or multi-tool sheath all by itself.\u00a0 Chances are you'll be able to purchase this smaller ancillary sheath separately.\nNRA Outdoors\nPursuing new markets, Benchmade has developed a new line of knives aimed expressly at the hook and bullet market, NRA Outdoors Knives, a licensed product line of the National Rifle Association. Some of the knives are made in Benchmade's factory in Oregon, others in Taiwan. You'll recognize many of the same Benchmade designers and in some cases, a definite similarity to existing knives as well as some unique new designs.\nStarting off with the folders, the Model 12700 ($65) and 12750 ($55) are Ken Steigerwalt's modern interpretations of traditional three-bladed pocketknives, 4.7 and 3.76 inches closed, respectively (119 mm and 71 mm). Both feature a clip point saber ground lockback main blade, 3.5 and\u00a0 2.8 inches (89 mm and 71 mm), respectively, and a slightly smaller modified spey/skinning blade. 3.12 and 2.5 inches (79 mm and 64 mm).\u00a0 The 12700 has a 3.12-inch (79 mm) gut hook blade and the smaller one has a can-opener and screwdriver combo in the thirds position. All the blades are 440C stainless and open with nail nicks.\u00a0 Liners are stainless and the scales are black micarta.\u00a0 The handle shape is similar to traditional canoe style, the enlarged bolster area at each end providing a bit of security and safety for the fingers.\nThe Model 12400 ($75) and 12410 ($65) are another pair of Steigerwalt lockback designs with a single one hand opening 440C stainless drop point saber ground blade, 3.4 (86 mm) and 2.7 inches (69 mm) long, respectively. They are 4.35 (110 mm) and 3.48 inches (88 mm) long closed, respectively. Liners are stainless covered with sculpted micarta scales. The satin finish stainless pocket clip is reversible; there's no lanyard hole. Available with plain or partially serrated edge.\nMel Pardue's contribution to the new line, the Model 12200 ($70), is a 3.25 inch (83 mm) modified wharncliff bladed one hand opening folder with a textured molded plastic handle.\u00a0 The handle, 4.15 inches closed (105 mm), has a curved underside, but there's not a lot of protection besides the checkering to prevent the hand from slipping onto the blade edge. The lock is\u00a0 Benchmade's Rolling Lock. The black coated pocket clip is reversible; there's a nice sized lanyard hole. Available with plain or partially serrated edge.\nWith a gun-stock shaped handle, the Steve Fecas designed Model 12300 ($29) is the value leader of this line. It has a 3.2-inch (81 mm) one hand opening drop point blade with a liner lock. The 4-inch (102 mm) long molded plastic handle has plenty of grip with its unique shape and there's a good thumb ramp as well.\u00a0 A removable pocket clip is included.\u00a0 Available with plain or partially serrated edge. There's no lanyard hole.\nWarren Osborne's influence is obvious in the lines of the Model 12800 ($170 - $180), the most striking folder in this new line. The machined anodized aluminum handles have a bidirectional waterfall pattern machined into the surface that is both attractive and that provides a very good grip, especially combined with the ergonomic shape having a pronounced finger guard and thumb ramp on the blade's spine. The ambidextrous AXIS Lock, dual thumb stud one-hand opening blade and reversible satin finish stainless split arrow pocket clip will be welcome by lefties. Steel for the uniquely styled 3.4 inches (86 mm) blade is premium 154CM stainless.\u00a0The blade shape might be described as a cross between a tanto and reverse curved drop point.\u00a0 Closed, the knife is 4.5 inches (114 mm) long. Available with plain or partially serrated edge and in a black coated partially serrated version. There's no lanyard hole.\nOf all the knives in the NRA Outdoors line, this is the one that most clearly evidences the Benchmade parentage. It's one of the best looking Osborne folders that Benchmade's done, to my eye (not that any of them are any slouch in the looks department).\u00a0 Regardless of the NRA Outdoors logo on the blade, I suspect most Benchmade Osborne blade collectors will be quick to snap this one up.\nThe line includes three practical fixed blade designs, including another by Osborne. The model 12500 ($100) is an all-around field and camp knife with a 6.25-inch (159 mm) modified drop point blade of 440C. It's got a relatively high grind, which ought to translate into a good slicer. The polished stainless guard is toped by molded Kraton rubber handle that's held in place with Benchmade's B.I.L.T. system, essentially a stainless pommel held on with a beefy socket head screw secured into a nut captured by the full hidden tang that holds the handle in place and allows for disassembly if desired for cleaning. The handle has deep rounded ribs on the lower portion.\u00a0 Unfortunately, there's no lanyard hole. The sheath is tooled leather that covers about two-thirds of the handle with a thumb-break retention strap that snaps in place.\nMike Snoody designed the 12520 ($90) with a 4-inch (102 mm) recurved drop point blade of 440C.\u00a0 There's a false edge that runs about two-thirds the way back on the spine. The full tang has Santoprene rubber overmolded scales with a very deep integral finger choil/guard. The handle incorporates added finger recesses and is very comfortable. There's a good sized lanyard hole.\u00a0 The sheath is a conventional folded ballistic nylon design with a plastic liner and a snap security strap around the handle.\nThe 4-inch (102 mm) skinner, Model 12550 ($100), is a Rick Hinderer design with lots of belly and an upswept tip. Blade steel is 440C. The full exposed tang has black stabilized wood scales that are very ergonomic. The lanyard hole in the tang is exposed by a cutout in the scales. The integral guard is deep and there are also thumb grooves on the blade's spine for added grip.\u00a0 It comes with a traditional style leather sheath with security strap.\nBoker\nFor those who find the pocket clip on a folder ruins the ergonomics or is plain old uncomfortable, Robert Voos has engineered The Boker Clip ($140), a new folder from Boker with a clip that retracts flush into the handle when the blade is opened. This lockback had sculpted aluminum handles, either plain with plain edge or black with partically serrated edge. We were never able to acertain the balde size or material.\nBoker compares the unique opening and locking mechanism of the Tic Toc to a pendulum clock, hence the name. On the right side the cast aluminum handles have a sot of lazy u-shaped slot with a button protruding through the slot.\u00a0 When closed the button sits at the forward top of the slot.\u00a0 Moving the button to the forward bottom of the slot opens the blade and locks it into position as it goes over-center. With very little practice this can be done very quickly and is more that a little bit habit forming\u0097pretty soon it does seem like a pendulum as you sit there opening and closing the knife, again and again. The opening stud is connected to the blade by an arm inside the handle, which could be a concern, only time will tell how strong this is or how well it ages in use. The 3-inch (76 mm) blade is 420 stainless, available in plain or combo edge.\nThe Helios line offers a choice of handle and blade materials, evolved from the Gemini line.\u00a0 The base model in either forest green or black hard anodizing ($165) have aluminum handles with \"cat's tongue\" inserts. Also available is a version with partially checkered rosewood handles ($165).\u00a0 The clip point blade is of X-15 T.N. stainless that is virtually unfazed by salt water or other corrosives.\u00a0 Blade length is 3.5 inches (89 mm) and overall length is 8.25 inches; they weigh in at 4.2 ounces ( g).\u00a0 The stainless pocket clip is ambidextrous and reversible for tip or tip down carry.\u00a0 The Helios Cera-Titan ($250) replaces the steel blade with a drop point made of Boker's unique Cera-Titan sintered titanium.\u00a0The handle inserts in this version are wood and the anodizing a gun metal blue.\nRatcheting up the exclusivity index, there's also a limited serialized edition with a \"Leo\" Damascus blade ($510) forged from the barrel of a Leopard main battle tank and tool steel alloy. The pattern is described at \"small pyramid.\"\u00a0 Inserts are desert ironwood.\u00a0 This is one of a number of unique Damascus steel knives Boker introduced, all of which are already spoke for at $515 to $620.\nThe Titanius ($125) combines Boker's small thin titanium handled gentleman's folder with a one hand opening Cera-Titan blade and liner lock. The drop point blade is 2.375 inches (60 mm). There's a design incised into the handle and a lanyard hole, so you end up with a very practical small lightweight and tough folder.\nNew to all the Cera-Titan line are pewter colored metal thumb disks to replace the cheap looking black plastic ones used previously.\nBuck\nShrink down Buck Knives' Alpha Hunter folder by 30% and you get the Alpha Dorado.\u00a0 Two versions with different blade steel and scales, both have a 2.5 inch (64 mm) drop point one-hand opening blade with partially exposed stainless handles and liner lock, 4 inches (102 mm) closed.\u00a0 Model 270 has a 420HC blade, charcoal birchwood scales and a ballistic nylon sheath ($64) while the Model 271 has an ATS-34 blade, rosewood scales and a leather sheath ($78). The exposed tang contains a lanyard hole; no pocket clip.\nSpeaking of the Alpha Hunter, due to customer demand, Buck now offers replacement \"SureGrip\" rubber scales to replace the wood ones on the ATS-34 bladed versions. $10 buys a complete conversion kit with the rubber handle slabs, replacement screws and an Allen wrench.\nReduce the classic Buck 110 lockback pocketknife by half and you get the aptly named \"The 55\" ($48). The clip point blade of 420HC is 2.375 inches (60 mm) long in a 3.375 inch (86 mm) handle.\u00a0 Like the original, the liner/handles are polished brass with \"natural woodgrain\" inlays. Anyone who has a fond spot for the 110 will eat this one up.\nBuck has added a white LED light to the diminutive Metro, creating the Metro LED ($27) and come up with a new model with an LED light, the Lumina ($55).\u00a0 The Metro LED has a simple on/off function and auto-off after three minutes. The Lumina has four programmed functions: High, medium and low beam and flashing, plus auto-shut off after five minutes.\nThe Metro uses the space dedicated to a bottle cap opener to house the electronics and\u00a0 two 3-volt CR-1616 batteries for the LED, which is contained in a translucent plastic handle. Same liner locked, one hand opening 1.125 inch (32 mm) blade of 420J2 steel as the original.\u00a0 It is 2.375 inches (60 mm) closed with a weight is 1.5 ounces (42 g).\nThe Lumina is also a liner lock with stainless frame and translucent plastic frame housing the electronic guts and two 3-volt CR-2032 batteries. The partially serrated blade is 3 inches (76 mm) of 420HC stainless with a one hand opening slot. 4.375 inches (110 mm) closed, the tail of one liner is exposed and forms a large lanyard hole.\u00a0 All up it weighs in at 3.6 ounces (102 g). The LED is offset to the left on the Lumina and aimed down at the blade, lighting what you may be cutting.\u00a0 If you're going to add a light to a knife, that seems to us like how it ought to work.\nOn both models the On/off switch is a rubber-covered button on the side. The lights are water resistant.\u00a0 Battery change requires a small screwdriver on the Lumina, but none is required for the Metro LED.\u00a0 We have no run time numbers for the lights.\nThe Code 3 CrossLock ($42), developed for emergency personnel use, replaces the saw blade of the Alpha CrossLock PBS with a 3-inch (76 mm) serrated sheepsfoot blade of 420 HC. This is paired with the existing 3-inch (76 mm) drop point blade in the unique double liner lock aluminum frame. The frame is available in anodized gray or red.\u00a0 Red is definitely the way to go, take my word on this. A ballistic nylon sheath is included.\nTom Mayo has designed another series of folders for Buck, the Cutback ($44) and Hilo ($50).\u00a0 Both are satin finish frame locks with a contoured stainless steel frame, drilled with a single line of Mayo's signature lightening holes down the center.\u00a0 A wee bit of flare at the forward end may keep your fingers off the sharp edge of the blade. The one hand opening drop point blade is of 440C stainless, 3.25 inches (83 mm) and 3.625 (91 mm) long, respectively, with a little bit of recurve to it. Overall length and weight is 4.125 inches (104 mm) and 3.3 ounces (92 g)\u00a0 and 4.5 inches (114 mm) and 4 ounces (114 g). The removable clip is also stainless; there's no lanyard hole.\nIn an attempt to keep them affordable, Buck is reproducing some of its classic slipjoint pocketknives in China.\u00a0 For example, the new model 371 Stockman (3.875 inches (98 mm) closed) with three blades of 440C is $28 versus the original made-in-the-USA 301 Stockman, which is $43 with 420HC blades. While the original has black plastic scales, these have Paca wood.\u00a0 Bolsters are still nickel silver with brass liners and the classic Hammer and Bolt Buck logo inlay. Also being produced is a mid-sized 373 Trio (3.25 inches \u2013 83 mm) three blader ($24), a two bladed 375 Deuce (2.625 inches - 67 mm)($20) and a 3-inch (76 mm) single blade folder, the 379 Solo ($15).\u00a0 Buck is standing behind these knives with their \"4-Ever Warranty\" and insists they are being built to strict quality standards.\nColumbia River Knife & Tool\nColumbia River Knife & Tool was aggressively promoting their new Merlin quick deployment sheath\u00a0that was designed by Michael Martinez. This unique patented concept allows for the folder to be carried in a variety of positions and when pulled from the sheath it automatically deploys.\u00a0 Somewhat akin the Emerson's Wave concept as it deploys from a pocket, but working with virtually any medium to large folder, the Merlin sheath provide very quick deployment without the need to manually open the blade. While it didn't take long to learn the basics of how to use it with the designer demonstrating the system, for the rest of us it comes with an instruction book, 52 pages worth for the \"Professional\" model ($35) with a multitude of carry and deployment options or a smaller 18 page manual for the \"Sport & Work\" model ($30) which covers only a few more traditional belt carry modes.\nAutomatic opening or assisted opening knives need not apply, but most others will work, including traditional folders without one-hand opening. The listed parameters are as follows: Blade Length between 2.5 inches (64 mm) and 5 inches (127 mm); Maximum Blade Thickness of 0.25 inches (6.3 mm), Maximum Blade Width of 1.5 inches (38 mm); Maximum Knife Weight of 8 ounces (227 g) and a Blade Channel Width (the space between the liners) between 0.125 inches (3 mm) and 0.1875 inches 5 mm).\nThe clip is designed to clip into a pocket or waistband, etc., or onto a belt or shoulder strap up to two inches (51 mm) wide.\u00a0 The point of the blade is inserted into a recess in the sheath with a sliding wedge to ensure it is a tight fit. The handle is then folded over and closed on an ear on the side of the sheath wedging it as tightly as possible.\u00a0 Once in place it is fairly well secured and takes a strong jerk to pull it loose, it isn't going to fall out or be easily dislodged. With the knife in place, this can leave a small portion of the blade exposed, which might imperil a small finger, so best not to use this around curious or clingy young children if your knife is one of those that does so. Some knives we tried covered virtually all the blade edge.\nThe sheath rotates into eight positions in relation to the clip and locks in place with a neoprene o-ring and screw . The clip is very secure. As you pull the knife handle the sheath rotates as necessary (up to 45 degrees) to allow the blade to come loose, automagically deploying it into the fully open, and if equipped with a blade lock, locked position. It does work as advertised; we took a sample home and tried it on a variety of knives and from numerous carry locations.\u00a0 If there's a notable drawback to the concept, it is that the same features that make this quick draw sheath so easy to deploy from also leave your knife exposed such that it could be grabbed by someone else. For some potential uses, especially for law enforcement personnel, that may be a concern.\u00a0 In addition, it most definitely is not sheeple friendly.\nThe Merlin II ($50) is a somewhat similar concept for fixed blades . It resembles a conventional rigid molded plastic sheath in most respects, but incorporates the rotating positioning system like that used on the Merlin but limited to 45 degrees and also includes the same strong clip.\u00a0 The bottom of the sheath is modular and exchangeable to accommodate different length blades.\u00a0 The standard cap holds blades up to 4.8 inches (122 mm). Four alternative caps ($7 to $10) accommodate blade lengths of 5.4 inches (137 mm) to 8.4 inches (213 mm) in one inch (25.4 mm) increments.\u00a0 Maximum blade thickness is 0.22 inches (5.5 mm) and blade width is from 0.72 inches (18 mm) to 1.65 inches (42 mm).\nThe blade is held in place by a curved spring that presses against the blade which in turn is lodged against two \"rails on the inside of the exterior wall of the sheath.\"\u00a0 At least that's how CRK&T explains it, they didn't have a sample for us to examine.\u00a0 There's also an ancillary thumb break strap to go around the handle for added security, if desired.\nAlso introduced was a Michael Martinez designed fixed blade, dubbed the Ultima ($120).\u00a0 While the blade is a conventional clip point of \"1.4116\" stainless steel (a German steel with performance similar to 440A according to CRK&T), 6.75 inches long, the handle is anything but conventional. Designed based on input from a panel of medical specialists including ergonomic experts, kinesthesiologists and a surgical tool designer, it incorporates 22 of the 23 \"points of contact\" in the hand that were determined as being the ideal handle by these experts.\nWhether this is real science or voodoo, the result is definitely different. It was difficult to tell how good a grip was to be had, both because of limited time to play with it and also because the prototype samples' scales had wire cut edges that were very sharp and gripping tightly was just plain uncomfortable due to this.\u00a0 There are lots of edges as the molded Zytel handle is comprised of a series of \"over 70\" triangular shapes with channels between them .\u00a0 These channels, referred to as sipes (a term usually used in reference to tire design) or \"ooze grooves,\" are designed to channel away mud, water and blood to ensure a good grip even in these difficult environments. Anyone who has seen video of a tire channeling away water to prevent hydroplaning will understand this concept.\nThe full tang extends out the back into a pry bar shape that also serves as a hook to help maintain a grip. Up front the scales expand to form a ramped full guard.\u00a0 The scales partially cover the top and bottom of the tang , so there's no contact with the metal, a feature we like.\u00a0 The blade is available with or without a small serrated section at the base of the blade and both have a bead blast finish. Overall length is 11.625 inches (295 mm) and it weighs in at 9.4 ounces (266 g).\nWe found it in intriguing that the standard sheath for this knife isn't the Merlin II , but rather is a traditional ballistic nylon tactical sheath with storage pocket.\nThe Van Hoy Snap Lock is now joined by a smaller sibling, the Snap Lock 2 ($50) with a 1.75 inch (44 mm) blade, 3 inches (76 mm) closed and 4.375 inches (111 mm) open. Same ambidextrous opening and closing with the unique Snap Lock and the blade steel is again AUS 4.\nA new Van Hoy design, the Snap Fire ($90) with yet another new lock design that is very eye-catching.\u00a0 The lock incorporates a large a stainless steel wheel with \"specteral titanium nitride coating\" and small serrations around the circumference. One hand opening is accomplished by rotating this wheel.\u00a0 A\u00a0 compression lock secures the 2.375 inch (60 mm) AUS 8 drop point blade in place.\u00a0 A safety, which operates like the LAWKS we've seen on most CRK&T liner locks, can be used to ensure the lock doesn't disengage inadvertently.\nClosing the blade is where things get a little weird.\u00a0 You press down on that stainless wheel to disengage the lock, which actually moves the blade pivot away from the lock allowing the blade to be closed by rotating the wheel.\u00a0 It's a whole lot easier to do than to describe.\nThe single-sided frame of the knife is gray anodized aluminum withy large cut-out, creating a skeletonized look.\u00a0 A curvaceous stainless steel bade guard protects the blade on one side, mirroring the removable pocket clip on the other side.\u00a0 Available in plain or combo edge.\nThe Side Hawg ($30), designed by Mike Franklin, takes the side blades used on the Serengeti folder to the logical endpoint, getting rid of the folder.\u00a0 The single edge grind blade of 420J2 stainless rides flat against the Zytel \"sheath plate,\" held in place by a stud and spring clip.\u00a0 The knife itself is 4.375 (111 mm) overall with a 0.12 inch (3 mm) thick skeletonized handle and a skinner style blade with a 1.625 inch (41 mm) cutting edge.\u00a0 There's a deep guard/choil and ridges on the top for thumb purchase. The whole package is 5.375 inches (137 mm) long, weighs 2.6 ounces (81 g), and it comes with a nylon strap and carabiner attached to the lanyard hole.\nThe Signature Hunter Series ($60) are three fixed blades with full tangs and bamboo scales, designed by Russ Kommer. The blades are 1.4116 stainless and there is a drop point, clip point and skinner with a gut hook. Blade length is 3.25 inches (83 mm),\u00a0 3.5 inches (89 mm) and 3.25 inches (83 mm) respectively, overall length is 7.879 inches (200 mm), 7.25 inches (184 mm) and 7.625 inches (194 mm), respectively. The blades have a very high hollow grind.\u00a0 A deep finger choil/ half guard with friction groves and thumb rest with same provide a good grip. The tang extends beyond the scales and there's an ample lanyard slot.\u00a0 The fitted leather sheath is very nice with perimeter tooling and burnished edges.\nTwo new Pat & Wes Crawford assisted opening designs, the Voodoo and Wild Weasel (both $130), are both their first assisted opening blades and the first knives produced in the U.S by CRK&T. Scales are hard anodized gray aluminum with stainless liners, dual thumb studs, and ambidextrous pocket clip. The blades are 154CM stainless, bead blasted and available with either plain or combo edge.\u00a0 The scales have black Santoprene inserts. The Wild Weasel has a drop point blade with a thumb ramp and long false edge. The Voodoo blade is a spear point with three graduated holes in the spine.\u00a0 Neither knife is equipped with a lanyard hole.\nKnife sharpening remains a mystery to many knife owners. At best they end up with a blade that is less dull, sometimes the blade is ruined and many won't even try, relying on professionals or sending the knife back to the factory. It's a practiced skill that simply has fallen into disuse. The simple systems require a fair amount to considerable skill to use and/or too use without ruining the blade and the guided system approach doesn't lend itself to being set up and used easily and quickly. As for powered systems; let's not even go there. CRK&T's new Slide Sharp ($35) is sort of the Dummies Guide of knife sharpeners, developed by Steve McCowen and Charles Kain.\nThis is one of those forehead slapping, why-didn't-I-think-of-this concepts.\u00a0 A 9.45 inch (240 mm) long ceramic rod\u00a0 is inserted into a wood base a few inches square. The kit comes with 2 ceramic rods, fine and course.\u00a0 You then drop a spring over the rod and then a plastic guide that has two slots in it, each at a different angle to the rod.\u00a0 Finally, there's a small domed handhold to go on top of the rod.\u00a0 Hold the rod steady with one hand at the top and simply slip the knife into the slot and run the guide down the rod while pulling the knife through.\u00a0 Release and the guide pops up again for another pass.\u00a0 Switch the blade direction in the guide to do the other side of the blade.\nThe current guide has a \"fine\" and \"utility\" setting, 17 and 21 degrees (nobody seems to know how they came to select those odd angles), but others will eventually be available and it wouldn't be all that difficult to make your own.\u00a0 It is all packed in a plastic box.\u00a0 We're hopeful; they'll come up with a field sharpener using the same concept, but which will pack into a much smaller box.\nA smaller version of the titanium handled M16, model M16-01T ($110), has been added with a 3.125 inch (79 mm) spear point AUS 8 blade.\nChris Reeve\nAnother Bill Harsey fixed blade design, Neil Roberts Warrior Knife ($329) is being produced by Chris Reeve , this a commemorative blade commissioned by Navy Chief Steven Bronson in honor of Petty Office First Class Neil Roberts, killed in action during Operation anaconda in Afghanistan in 2002, the first SEAL to loose his life in action since 1989. Roberts graduated from SEAL Class #184 and that number of serialized and specially engraved knives have been set aside for the SEAL community.\nIf you're not a SEAL, you can still get one, minus the serial number and engraving, but otherwise identical. The 6-inch (152 mm) S30V drop point plain edged blade is KG Gun-Kote coated, like the rest of Chris' fixed blades. Overall length is 11 inches (279 mm) and weight is 12.3 ounces (349 g). Handle slabs are sandblasted black canvas micarta. The handle incorporates an angled full guard and deep finger scallop and the requisite lanyard hole. There's a finger choil ahead of the guard. Sheath is a tan Combat Master by Spec-Ops. I like this one better than the Harsey designed Green Beret knives, it has my favorite blade shape, no serrations and it's just the right size.\nA trust fund has been established to support the education of Neil Robert's son, Nathan. Twenty dollars from each knife purchase is contributed to this fund ( click for more information on the Neil Roberts Memorial Project )\nChris also came out with a spear point version of the Nkonka, which is otherwise identical to the original, having the tool kit in the hollow handle.\nGerber\nGerber's LMF II is available in two versions, the ASEK (Aircrew Survival Egress Knife) ($120) and the Infantry(??). The only difference is that the ASEK comes with a Safety Knife for cutting seat belts and parachute shrouds. This is also available separately ($??). The LMF II is 10.59 inches (269 mm) overall length with a black coated stout clip point 4.84-inch (123 mm) blade of 12C 27 Sandvik steel. The knife weighs 11.4 ounces (323 g). The blade is approximately 50% serrated. The overmolded Hytrel rubber handle incorporates a double guard and the same design technology as the Silver Trident with the pommel/butt cap separated from the tang, isolating it completely. That butt cap incorporates both a robust pointed plexigalss/canopy breaker and a hammerhead designed to be used with the knife held in its sheath, as well as a large lanyard hole. The guard is pierced with holes and the handle has a depression to leave room for a a shaft to allow the knife to be used as a spear, though why anyone would want to is beyond us. That's just a good way to lose your second most important survival tool. You probably already lost your first if you try this trick.\nThe sheath has a soft rubber overmolding on the main molded plastic sheath body to cut down on noise. The plastic sheath is attached to a ballistic nylon upper portion with straps and it is equipped for a variety of carry modes. It is fully compatible with the MOLE system with straps required included, or can just be hung on your belt. It comes with Fastek style buckle-equipped straps for leg or calf attachment. There are double snapped retention straps around the handle and slots and holes in the sheath for about any sort of attachment means you could imagine. It is claimed to be suitable for parachuting, which we don't doubt. The sheath incorporates a removeable pull-though carbide sharpener attached on the face of the sheath body, about as easy to use as possible, no skill required. Both the handle and sheath are dark tan in color, the ballistic nylon is brown.\nThe Safety Knife is pretty much your standard seat belt cutter with a slotted double razor blade cutter molded into a plastic handle. It requires its own separate ballistic nylon sheath with a Velcro retained flap.\nGerber's latest entry in the multi-tool warts is the Diesel Multi-Plier ($90), which is more or less a buffed-up version of their Multiplier. It retains the same basic operation with one-hand opening sliding pliers and the like. This is a needlenose design with the pliers' jaws being substantially bulked up compared to the original for added strength. There's a much longer wire cutter section incorporated into the pliers.\nAll the blades and tools lock with somewhat larger overmolded lock releases. The tools seem a bit beefer as well, though don't have exact measurements. The knife blade is a sort of tanto-esque design, 50% serrated. A double-row wood saw mimics this same shape. This is a dedicated saw blade, not the universal saw coupler that accepted jigsaw blades as used in some previous Multi-Pliers. The scissors have longer blades and appear to be better designed so they won't as easily jam in the cut like all th eothers Gerber has.\nThere's also a metal/wood file, can opener, three flat screwdrivers, Phillips driver and a lanyard loop. They eliminated the solderless terminal crimper between the handles of the standard Multi-Pliers, which we hate to see go away. A ballistic nylon sheath is included.\nMessing with a classic can be risky, but the new Gator II folders are a definite big step up (then originals will still be available). Still a lockback with their trademark tacky rubber grip, they now have a one hand opening blade, via a slot in the blade. The 4.49 inch (114 mm) handle has an added finger scallop, three total now, with ridges in the handle top and bottom. The 3.70-inch drop point blade of ??? stainless has a lot of belly and a ridged thumb rest. It is available in both plain and partially serrated edge. There's also a version with a gut hook in the spine, also with plain or partially serrated options. There's also a lanyard hole, which the original lacked, and it all weighs in at 3.4 ounces (96 g). Includes a thermoformed ballistic nylon sheath.\nThe Gator Exchange-A-Blade Saw takes the original excellent Exchange-A-Blade Saw and beefs it up with a Gator Grip molded handle, easier to operate top lock and a bit bigger blade. The saw is 8.78 inches (223 mm) closed and the blades are 6.65 inches (169 mm) long. This compares to 8.19 inches (208 mm) and 6.18 inches (157 mm) for the original (which is still available).\nI'll have to try this saw out to see how well the grippier Gator handle works in heavy use. Without gloves my concern would be that it could create hot spots and blisters. Sawing is not the same as using a knife. I do like that they have also added a lanyard hole. As before, they offer it with only one blade or with both a fine/bone saw and coarse/wood saw. With the two-bladed combination you get a ballistic nylon sheath.\nGerber's joined the assisted opening club with the Fast Draw ($60) using \"Forward Action Spring Technology.\" You've just got to wonder how many brain cells bite the dust as these knife company marketing types try to come up with trademarkable and catchy acronyms for their designs. In any case, custom maker Butch Vallotton, well known for his automatic knives, designed this patented opening mechanism. The 3.25 inch (83 mm) drop point 440 stainless blade has an opening stud or a small flipper poking through the top of the handle to start things opening. It takes only a little movement. The slide safety located in the side of the left scale also serves to release the lock to allow the blade to close. Closed, the Fast Draw is 4.19 inches (106 mm) with a patterned Zytel handle. Available in plain or partially serrated edge, there's no lanyard hole.\nHeckler & Koch\nHK introduced a well-rounded line of fixed blades and folding knives, all designed by Mike Snoody and produced by Benchmade. The HK34 AXIS Tactical Folder and Auto models ($220 and $258) are available with either a tactical drop point blade or a radical tanto style. The 3.4-inch (86 mm) blades are 154CM and have a high thumb ramp rising over the dual thumb studs. The partial liners are stainless to secure the AXIS Lock inlaid into cast aluminum handles having an overmolded Zytel overlay on the aft portion of the handle.\u00a0 The result is an appearance of an aluminum bolster, but it is all integrated. Overall length open is 8.19 inches (208 mm) and the weight is 5.6 ounces (159 g).\nIn the AXIS Tactical, both blades are available in plain or combo partially serrated edge with the drop point plain edge and tanto combo edge also available with black Zytel coating.\u00a0 The Auto is available only in combo edge with the black coating. There's no lanyard hole, but the black pocket clip is reversible.\nThe KN30 Liner Lock ($110) one hand opener has stainless liners with overmolded black Zytel handles patterned similarly to the HK34 series, but with a deep finger choil/guard. The 2.97-inch (75 mm) satin finish blade is N690 stainless in a clip point recurved shape with a wide false edge that extends all the way back to the low-rise thumb ramp.\u00a0 Overall length is 6.84 inches (174 mm).\u00a0 There's a removable black pocket clip, but no lanyard hole. Available in plain or combo edge.\nThe HK36 Tactical Fixed Blade ($150) has a 3.62-inch (92 mm) broad recurved hollow ground plain edged blade of 440C stainless. The spine has a short section of false edge, then two scallops followed by a long grooved thumb rest, resulting in a distinctive profile.\u00a0 Three holes drilled in the blade spine add another decorative element. The black molded Zytel scales have three scalloped cutouts that reveal the full tang, each with three small decorative drilled dimples. The finger choil/half guard is deep for security.\u00a0 There's a lanyard hole in the butt with an included braided lanyard and it slips into a molded and riveted Zytel sheath. The blade is 0.150 inches (3.8 mm) thick and the knife is 7.62 inches (194 mm) overall and weighs 4.3 ounces (122 g).\nThe 5-inch (127 mm) fixed blade continues the length-derived naming as the HK50 Tactical Fixed Blade ($198). The straightforward drop point blade is of 440C with a black Xylan coating and 60/40 partially serrated combo edge. The false edge extends well back on the spine and the prominent thumb ramp extends well forward. The scales attached to the full tang are multilayered G10 for a unique look, with the outer layer machined with lots of tactile grooves for a good grip. There are two deep finger scallops and a rounded butt with a lanyard hole. Sheath is a typical ambidextrous Cordura nylon tactical style with a storage pocket having a Velcro'd flap.\nKershaw\nKershaw's primary designer, Ken Onion, collaborated with Frank Centofante to create the Centofante-Onion, which is available with two handle materials.\u00a0 The Model 1610 ($70) has anodized red aluminum handles with a curvy design machined into them and the Model 1615 ($100) has polished stainless steel handles coated with black Tungsten DLC coating. The handles have three graduated round recesses at the rear of the handle inlaid with genuine pearl. It adds a touch of class, especially to the 1615 where the pearl and DLC coating really compliment each other nicely. Both Kershaw's SpeedSafe assisted opening mechanism, stainless liners and liner lock and are equipped with a Centofante inspired wharncliff blade of 440A stainless, 2.25 inches (57 mm) long.\u00a0 Closed the knives are 3 1/8 inches (79 mm).\u00a0 The 1610 weighs 1.6 ounces (45 g) including a removable pocket clip; the 1615 weighs 2.4 ounces (68 g) and has a leather sheath with clip.\nThe Mini MOJO ($100) is another Ken Onion SpeedSafe assisted opener with a newly patented Stud Lock . This ambidextrous lock incorporate the dual opening studs (which aren't the primary opening mechanism on these and most other Kershaws, they are equipped with Ken Onion's original flipper design incorporated into the blade) as the lock. The studs are spring loaded with a compression spring and slide fore and aft in a slot in the blade. When the blade is fully open, they lock back into a recess in the forward top part of the handle. The lock is self-adjusting due to a slight ramp in this recess. Simply moving the studs forward releases the blade. We have some concerns upon our limited\u00a0 examination that this could be pretty easily done inadvertently, compromising the blade lock's utility and safety.\u00a0 We'll have a better idea if this is an issue after we receive a sample to field test.\nThe handles are stainless with a satin finish and a large G-10 insert.\u00a0 The handle incorporates a prominent guard and finger hook and is equipped with a lanyard hole. That guard and oversized flipper may help to counteract the potential of inadvertent release of the lock; they will close on the finger which would prevent the blade from closing, though we're not sure that's the best solution.\nThe 440A stainless recurved blade is 2 3/8 inches (61 mm) long and closed the Mojo measures 3.5 inches (89 mm). There's a prominent false edge and thumb ramp. It's a hefty knife for its size at 3.1 ounces (?g).\nKershaw shrunk the Ken Onion designed Boa into the Baby Boa ($75), though you have to look closely to see the family resemblance because this baby is pretty dolled up compared to the original's tactical look.\u00a0 It has full stainless liners and liner lock with partial aluminum scales, anodized with a red with black smoked finish, that allow the drilled liners to peek out from behind for a unique look. A cutout in the left scale provides a view of the torsion bar spring that drives the assisted opening. There's a lanyard hole at the rear. The SpeedSafe assisted opening recurved blade is 440A, 2 inches (51 mm) long.\u00a0 Closed, it is 2.75 inches (70 mm) long. It weighs in at 1.7 ounces (48 g).\u00a0 For those who liked the size of the Chive, but not the very narrow tip, the baby Boa will be a welcome alternative.\u00a0 Now they just need to add some more elegant finishes.\nA new Ken Onion fixed blade design, the Outcast ($100), is a large bolo style blade, sort of Kershaw's answer to the BK&T Brute. The blade is 10 inches (254 mm) of titanium nitride coated D2 steel. The signature style Ken Onion handle is Santoprene rubber overmolded on top of glass-filled nylon. Incorporated into the handle si a very deep half guard and the handle swells at the top as well. Overall, the Outcast is 16 inches (406 mm) long and weighs 22 ounces (624 g). The molded Kydex sheath includes a security strap for added insurance.\nWhile it hit the market shortly before SHOT Show, this was out first opportunity to sample the Two Can ($30).\u00a0 This small executive folder combines a knife blade and scissors in a unique manner. There is a one hand opening chisel ground wharncliff blade, non-locking, of 420 stainless, 1.5 inches (35 mm) long. Open the second blade that lies alongside the first using a nail nick and you have a very functional pair of scissors for light cutting.\u00a0 In this configuration, you squeeze the scissors blades directly.\u00a0 The handles are stainless, 2.75 inches (70 mm) closed, and incorporate a small carabinier clip on the tail end which would do fine to hold keys and the like.\u00a0 It seems like this would be a perfect tool for an office setting.\nLeatherman\nThe emphasis at Leatherman this year was big--really big.\u00a0 Huge might be a better description. The new Core ($78) and Surge ($102) multi-tools are the largest ever offered by the company, and arguably the biggest folding tools with full\u2013sized pliers available anywhere (the previous heavyweight was the Victorinox SwissTool).\nThe Core weighs in at 10.2 ounces (289 g), or 13.2% more than the Super Tool 200 it replaces and 0.2 oz (6 g) more than the SwissTool. That translates into larger implements with greater strength and reach.\nThe Surge is more or less a Wave on steroids---lots of steroids! At 12.2 ounces (346 g), all included, it is 35.5% heavier than the Super Tool 200, 21.6% more than the new Core and a whopping 43.5% more than the Wave. Looking at it another way, the Surge tips the scales at just over three-quarters of a pound. And, that's even before adding the weight of the sheath, 1.2 oz (34 g) for nylon or 2 oz. (57 g) for leather. Only real men and amazons need apply.\nBoth tools are 4.5 inches (114 mm) in length, closed, same as the Super Tool. The Core is 0.75\" inch (21.3 mm) thick; the Surge is 0.781 inch (22.1 mm) thick.\nHere's a table comparing the blades and implements included in the two new tools:\n"}, {"score": 707.37445, "uuid": "56307364-e95a-53a0-ab4f-62873459d908", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0710wb-45-15111", "target_hostname": "zknives.com", "target_uri": "http://zknives.com/knives/fixed/busse/bussesh2c.shtml", "page_rank": 1.2517767e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Busse <em>Steel</em> Heart II Combat Knife Review", "snippet": "Which <em>should</em> give you an idea regarding the availability and market price of the old Busse blades, INFI <em>or</em> not.

Each small variation results in a different use. There are long ones, short ones, wide ones, narrow ones, curved ones, angled ones and the list goes on and on. They are made from carbon steel, stainless steel, stamped steel ceramic or even plastic. The better knives are balanced so as they are being used they do not feel awkward. By awkward I mean they feel heavy or light at the pointed end. Proper balance eases the strain on the user. Grips or handles have made great advances further easing the strain on the user. Sharpness is also a key factor in easing the strain on the user. The type of edge used for a particular cutting or slicing project is very important.\nStyles\nThe size and shape of the knife determines its primary use. The cook's or chef's knife is used for the heavy duty cutting needed in the kitchen. It is normally a longer, heavy constructed knife that will handle the abuse of the overzealous cook. Slicing, dicing, and chopping are some of the primary uses of the cook's knife. The slicing knife is for use in slicing food such as ham or large cuts of meat. The Bread knife normally has a thin serrated blade. The serrated blade allows it to easily slice through a loaf of bread or a tomato without crushing or tearing. The steak knife is normally a smaller version of the slicing knife, designed for individual use. The knife used most often by any cook is the paring knife. It is a small knife that is easy to handle and can be used for cutting, peeling and dicing fruits, vegetables, meats, cheeses, etc.\nConstruction\nThe way knives are constructed determines several things. There are several types of material used in the manufacturing of the blade material.\nCarbon Steel blades are made from iron with about 2% carbon. This blade is easily sharpened and holds its edge well. The down side of this is they tend rust if they are not dried immediately after washing. Over time they obtain a dark color considered to be the sign of a quality knife. The higher the percentage of carbon to iron, the better the blade. Stainless Steel blades are made from an alloy of iron with 10-15 % chromium, maybe some nickel and molybdenum with only a very small amount of carbon. This type of material cannot be sharpened as sharp as the carbon steel blade, but it is very resistant to staining and discoloration. Some people think the discoloration imparts a flavor into the food.\nHigh Carbon Stainless Steel blades combine the best of both worlds. They do not discolor like the carbon blades, but they can be sharpened to a keen edge that is long lasting. They do not impart any flavor into your food.\nTitanium alloy blades are lighter and more flexible than steel blades. The carbon in the alloy allows them to be heat treated so they will hold an edge well. They do not impart any flavor into your food, either.\nCeramic blades are made from ceramic. They are extremely hard and will hold their edge for a long time. They will cut the glaze on a dinner plate and should only be used on a cutting board. The down side is that they must be professionally sharpened.\nPlastic blades are not very sharp and are specialized in the use in the kitchen. They are used to cut vegetables so they don't turn dark.\nLaminate blades are made by layering different materials together. The number of possibilities is endless. The only way to decide if you want one of these types is to buy and try.\nSteel blades are either forged or stamped.\nForged blades are made in a detailed process that takes a lot of time and is accomplished by skilled craftsman. I will not go into detail here, but this type of blade is more often than not preferred by chefs.\nStamped blades are designed to be made in mass. The quality of the metal used is such that it can be worked quickly into a finished product. This type of knife is less expensive than the forged one, but it must be replaced on a regular basis.\nThe Business Edge\nThe type and design of the knife edge determines how it should be used.\nFlat ground blades are tapered from the backbone to the edge. This blade is very strong but is heavy.\nHollow ground blades look a lot like the flat ground except starting about halfway up the blade it is ground into a concave shape. It is weaker than the flat ground blade but has the advantage of being lighter.\nThe Serrated blade looks like a saw. It is ideal for cutting things that are hard on the outside and soft on the inside. It actually tears the food rather than cutting, so it should not be used for all kinds of food.\nHandle\nThe handle of your knife can be made from an array of different materials. The basic handles are wood, plastic, composite and Stainless Steel.\nWood handles are made from hardwoods. Wooden handles are the most attractive and do not become slick when wet. Some individuals claim the porosity of the wood retains bacteria and refuse to use them. This is up to the individual as whether this factor is included in the decision process.\nPlastic handles can be molded into almost any shape you can imagine. The modern plastic handle has evolved into ergonomically designed units designed by a computer. They fit your hand nicely, but a lot of pole people complain about the \"one-size-fits-all\" concept. Also, plastic handles can be slippery when wet.\nComposite handles incorporate the best of the wood and plastic materials. They are easy to care for and some chefs will use nothing else.\nStainless Steel handles are by far the most durable. They are the most sanitary but can be tricky to handle when wet. Manufacturers form them with bumps and finger grooves to help eliminate this problem.\nConclusion\nThis information is not by any means everything there is to know. It should give you the basic information you need to make a qualified decision. There are many variations to the ones listed. Choosing your knife will be determined by several factors. How often will you use a particular knife, what will it will be used for, and how much are you willing to spend are just a few of the things you should look at. Hopefully the information given will give you a basic understanding and an idea of what you might look for when purchasing your kitchen cutlery.\nAbout the Author\nBorn and raised in a small town in Oklahoma.

Strong blade with attractive and practical sculpting of blade surfaces. The handle is gorgeous, laminated in black and green, sizable, and hefty. Beautiful guard and butt. The sheath is great quality, but should really be in black leather without obvious stitching to match the elegant look of the knife.\nA giant chestnut tree, shading the small Boeker tool factory in Remscheid in the 17th century, is the oldest traceable symbol connected with the Boeker name. Apparently, Boeker tools were very successful, since they were among the leading products in Germany and neighboring countries 100 years later.\nDue to the increasing demand in a restless political era, Hermann and Robert Boeker decided in 1829 to begin with the production of sabers. As early as September 1830, the accounting records indicate a weekly production of 2,000 items, made by 64 smiths, 47 grinders and a large number of unskilled laborers. In view of the constantly increasing variety of tools and cutting instruments and the good opportunities for worldwide sales, the family realized that the individual steps in the manufacturing process had to be spread out for optimal realization of its interests. As a result, Hermann Boeker emigrated and founded H. Boeker & Co. in New York. Young Robert developed his enterprise in Canada, founding a branch in Mexico later in 1865. This branch is still a market leader in its country under the name of Casa Boeker.\nHeinrich crossed the nearby Wupper river and went to Solingen, where the German industry of cutting tools was growing by leaps and bounds at that time. In 1869, he founded Heinr. Boeker & Co. with Hermann Heuser, a well-known specialist in the field of cutting tools. The Boeker family in Remscheid and their overseas cousins had a lot of interest in and a great demand for shaving blades, scissors and pocket knives from Heinrich's new enterprise. They had to identify their products for the overseas markets in a simple way, since many customers and consumers had problems with the German name Boeker ? not considering the fact that illiteracy was widely spread. In Heinrich's opinion, the chestnut tree near the Remscheid facility represented an ideal, easy-to-remember symbol. This brand symbol was owned by the Remscheid company, together with a second logo, the arrow. One of the few valuable documents that survived the total destruction of WWII is an ad by Boeker, Remscheid, from the year 1874, showing both logos.\nThe relationship between the two Boeker companies had always been extremely friendly. Therefore, Heinrich was allowed to take the tree symbol across the river with him ? without any big fight or cost. Since then, not a single Boeker article has left the Solingen factory without being identified by the tree symbol. After more than 100 years of existence the old chestnut tree was the victim of lightening. In 1925 a talented artist carved a copy of the majestic tree on a piece of the trunk. This original piece of art decorates the boss' office in the Boeker plant.\nAs early as 1900, the majority of articles produced by Boeker were distributed in the US market. H. Boker & Co. in New York concentrated primarily on cutting tools from Solingen. Soon pocket knives became more important than scissors, shaving blades and eating utensils. The demand increased even more rapidly than Solingen was able to supply, so that the Americans in New York began their own production of pocket knives. A little later, pliers were included as well. Since the tree symbol had become well known by then and the various branches of the international Boeker family enjoyed an excellent relationship among each other, it was not difficult to receive permission from the Solingen relatives to use the tree symbol also for the American products. Since that time, two different lines of Boeker knives have been on the American market with the same brand symbol, sometimes even with the same article numbers, but one line was made in the USA and the other in Solingen. Only the declaration of marketability clarified that one line was from Boker USA and the other from H. Boker Improved Cutlery Solingen. The relationship was interrupted during WWII. The Solingen factory burned down completely. None of the equipment, tools, catalog materials or samples was spared. Those few originals from the past we have today survived the war in private homes and were made available to the company. The firm lost one of its most valuable assets: the registration of the tree symbol for the American market was confiscated pursuant to American law. John Boker Jr. acquired it in New York, in order to secure it for the distribution of the American and German products. Soon after the war, the destroyed factory was rebuilt. Those loyal skilled workers who had survived the war, returned and helped with the reconstruction of the building as well as the production, gradually regaining the previous high standard of quality.\nThe American cousins renewed their business contact with Solingen and started to place orders. Within a few years Boker, New York, had again become the principal customer. Models like the 7588 and 7474 and the most expensive item, the sports knife \"Flagship Model 182\" could not cross the ocean fast enough to reach B\u00f6ker friends all over the country.\nIn the early 60s, Boker USA was sold and eventually acquired by the well-known scissors manufacturer Wiss & Sons. Wiss retained the manufacture of Boeker knives and sold them together with Solingen products. Of course, this meant that the Boeker scissors ceased to be competitors of the Wiss line in the American market. In the early 70s, Wiss sold to Cooper Industries, a multinational company. This new change in America proved to be advantageous for Boker.\nA very close business, as well as personal relationship developed with this industrial giant. Due to its strength on the market, Cooper was able to restore the original magnitude of the Boeker name. Thanks to the very lively business activities with Cooper for eight years, the Solingen facility could streamline its production and develop new, modern products. Without exaggeration, Boker manufactures the largest assortment of high-quality knives for sportsmen and collectors with an unsurpassed variety of materials for blades and handles. Today, Boeker knives range from 320-layer Damascus steel to very modern ceramics, with handles ranging from high-quality mother-of-pearl to Thuya root wood and state-of-the-art synthetics...\nIn 1983 Cooper discontinued its own knife production. Models still in demand are being manufactured in Solingen today. As a result of friendly negotiations, Cooper restored the American trademark rights three years later, providing Solingen with the opportunity to become self-reliant in the huge American market. Thus, in 1986, Boker USA, Inc. was created in Denver, Colorado. Chuck Hoffman, the man who was involved with the company then, was active as CEO until 2007, working with a young, energetic team. The current CEO is Dan Weidner.\nThe great importance of Boeker in the South American markets (Argentina and Chile) and in Mexico is due to the efficient men of the Boeker family, who were active for us in these countries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Today's trademark includes the terms TREEBRAND and ARBOLITO. Since the Argentinian market in particular is subject to extreme economic and political fluctuations, the good name ARBOLITO was in danger of being forgotten. In 1983, Boeker Arbolito S. A. was founded jointly with the Salzmann family primarily to manufacture household and work knives in Argentina. Thanks to the constant modernization and expansion of product lines the company in Buenos Aires is able to compete worldwide with selected products today.\n<a href=\"/custom/boker_warranty.doc\">Boker Warranty Information</a>\n<a href=\"/custom/boker_ceramic_info.doc\">Boker Ceramic Knife Information</a>\nKnife Depot Special Offers\nThrough March 31, take $5 off any order over $100.

A great addition to a growing knife collection, and an important tool in the kit of any working chef. This 270mm size is a popular choice for professional chefs and other users who might already be using a larger chef's knife and so find the extra length of the 270mm slicer worthwhile. For most home users though, I'd definitely recommend the 240mm (9.5\") length. Great for slicing big meats, vegetables and fruits. Some people even end up using these knives are all-around kitchen tools because they're so comfortable to handle and slice so well (though for tougher items I'd still recommend a proper chef's knife). The blade is low profile, thin, flexible and extremely sharp -- a true high quality slicer. As with all Sakai Takayuki knives, I find the fit and finish and overall quality excellent, and the edge is very, very sharp and precisely ground and finished.

Or you can bring it to a professional knife sharpening service (a GOOD one that you trust!) who can re-grind the edge however you'd like.

These blades will quickly and easily take a super sharp edge and HOLD it like no stainless steel knife can. The rosewood handle will be MUCH longer-lasting than the softer and lighter magnolia wood usually seen on traditional Japanese knives, and the stainless steel tang inside the handle means that any moisture will not result in premature pitting or damage to the handle.

Materials for blanks vary from the basic stainless steel to venerable Damascus steel to the newest alloys, and all of them have advantages and disadvantages. You also have to consider your knife's eventual size so you'll know how big a knife blank to purchase. Before purchasing, know what you're getting.\nStainless steel is the most basic blank you can get, and it's good for general purpose knives. The stainless steel variety won't hold as good a blade as many of the other alloys, but they look nice and are good for general purpose use. Stainless steel knife blanks are the least expensive available that actually make decent blades.\nTalonite is made of a cobalt-chromium alloy that forms carbides, so it tests soft by most hardness tests even though it's very hard and wears extremely well. If you try to cut a Talonite knife blank with a band saw, you will wreck the saw, so you'll need an abrasive cut off wheel instead. Ceramic belts do an excellent job of grinding Talonite, but other types of belts don't do so well. Carbide drill bits will be necessary for drilling holes into Talonite.\nClosely related to Talonite is Stellite. Knife blanks made of stellite resist corrosion and wear. Stellite doesn't oxidize easily in any condition, and resist heat well. Both Talonite and stellite are more difficult to work with than stainless steel, so are better for an experienced knife maker. Before buying either material, consider the equipment you have to work with. Though stellite and Talonite blanks are of temptingly good quality, if you break your drill and band saw while working with them, it's not really worth it.\nTitanium knife blanks are very good for knifemaking; in fact, the highest grade of titanium is called knife-grade titanium. Titanium is an alloy of iron, oxygen, carbon, and various other materials; titanium benefits from the strength of the material, but it is a little brittle compared to other materials. Titanium takes a good blade as well as a good surface finish.\nDamascus steel isn't the Damascus steel of the Crusades, but rather a modern reproduction. When you look at a knife blank of Damascus steel, you'll see patterning on the metal; this is the carbides in the metal, which precipitate out during forging and strengthen the edge far beyond the capability of iron alone. Damascus steel blanks today are generally pattern welded steel, which is made of layers of steel and iron which are welded together; Japanese katana are made this way. If you get a blank made of Damascus steel, don't expect it to be just like the old blades.\nA nifty new twist on Damascus steel is Timascus, which is a titanium Damascus; Timascus is limited in availability, and should be treated the same way as titanium. These will closely resemble steel Damascus, and vary widely in color due to the particular alloy used. Knife blanks of this material will hold a highly polished finish, which will be brightly colored; or you can give these blades a pearly finish, which will show off the ripples in the metal nicely.\nYou may find other materials, but these are the basics. Before purchasing, do some research on the materials; there are different grades of each, especially stainless steel, and while some grades make excellent knives, others make excellent butterknives.\nBefore buying a knife blank, make sure you have your new blade planned, and have considered the size of the resultant knife while you're looking for suitable material. You can't glue extra metal onto a knife blade, nor can you be certain of cutting of metal if it's too large. It is probably best, in fact, to know the size of your handle before shelling out the cash.\nGood planning, careful consideration, and a mind for the artistry of your eventual blade will all help you choose the proper metal for your purposes. The knife blank is the most important component of your knife; if the raw goods are bad it doesn't matter how good the rest looks. Consider your options carefully before purchasing.

Also a wise move buying from CKtG! I never buy anything without checking there first. Mark does customer service like few others!\nOverall I think the warranty isn't really all that big a deal. If you have a problem it will probably occur right away; any reputable dealer will exchange it or allow a return. I know that that some companies (notably Wusthof) will repair or replace a knife even in cases of obvious abuse, but in normal use it's unlikely you'll have a problem that can't be fixed. The most likely problem you'll face with a Tojiro is probably having the tip break if you drop it point first on concrete. That might break any knife tip. But I've repaired many broken tips, it's really not a big deal.\nOne thing I will point out is that Shun no longer offers free sharpening. Going forward they will give you a discount for a sharpening chain that you can send it to. To me that pretty much eliminates the sole reason I'd ever recommend Shun to anyone. Nowadays the Tojiro DP line is made out of the same VG-10 steel Shun uses, and they're a bit cheaper. To me that's a slam dunk.\nQuote:\nOriginally Posted by jm2hil\nI also ordered the EdgePro Apex chosera stone kit.\nThe system looks amazing and easy to use. I wasn't all that happy with stones it came with but saw this kit and i'm pretty excited to use the Chosera stones. Hope that I can pick it up quickly.\nWhen my bank account feels fuller I will start buying individual stones and practice on some older knives. Someone said on the forum that its not just to make your knives sharper its an art. I'd like to learn to sharpen by hand with the individual stones.\nAlso got the idahone ceramic rod.\nCongrats! The Edge Pro will do an amazing job on your Tojiros. And while the stock stones work okay the Chocera stones are amazing, completely on a different level. I'd say you're all set!\nQuote:\nLast question:\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for stropping?\nShould I get the strops that fit the edge pro? or should I get the hand america hone base?\nThis ones on my birthday list so spare no expense!\nThanks again\nYou really are going \"all in\"!\nThe EP works well for stropping but you can do it freehand, too. I use both. The Hand American strop base is very nice. I tend to use compounds on balsa wood more than leather but that's just me.\nOne last thing you should get is a 5/16\" drill stop collar for setting the angle between stones. You can pick one up at any hardware store for a couple dollars, tops. It will really speed up your sharpening while improving your precision.\n__________________\nIf we're not supposed to eat animals, then how come they're made out of meat?\n06-15-2011, 10:01 AM\n"}, {"score": 596.975, "uuid": "b04bc85a-4e7f-557c-a175-3dd564f4fecb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0904wb-31-03678", "target_hostname": "www.amazingribs.com", "target_uri": "http://www.amazingribs.com/BBQ_buyers_guide/smokers/egg_kamado_and_ceramic_grills_and_smokers.html", "page_rank": 1.2589355e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Reviews of Big Green Egg, <em>Ceramic</em>, and other Kamado-Style Cookers", "snippet": "Then, please tell me everything <em>I</em> need to know to answer your question.

This will burn off any manufacturer's grease, and give you a sense for how to set it up to hit the two important target temps that almost all my recipes use: 225\u00b0F and 325\u00b0F.\nOf course, in order to do this, you absolutely positively must have a good digital oven thermometer . I don't care how much you spent on your grill, the bi-metal dial thermometer that came with it is probably cheap and unreliable and likely to be off by as much as 50\u00b0F. Worse still, it is in the dome, and the temp down on the grate where the meat sits is much different. Like a musician, you must master your instrument to make great food.\nResources\nHere are some websites that you might want to visit for more info.\nNakedWhiz . Don't let the name scare you. This guy knows more than anybody on lump charcoal, and a lot about ceramic cookers, especially Big Green Eggs.\nWarning!!!\nKamados are susceptible to a very dangerous phenomenon: Backdraft! Flashback is an extremely dangerous condition that is common to all ceramic cookers, it is important that you understand what it is, how it\u2019s caused, and how to prevent it.\nCeramics are nearly airtight, and the coals can get starved for oxygen at low temps or during shutdown. Open the lid, oxygen rushes in, and poof, a serious fireball. No more facial hair. Or worse.\nYou should always wear fire resistant gloves , the longer the better, when opening a kamado. To prevent backdraft fireballs, slowly open the top damper a bit and wait a minute.\nOpen the lid slowly and stand to the side rather than the front of the cooker. Says Dennis Linkletter of Komodo Kamado \"It is safest for a new user to always assume that flashback conditions are present and to use the utmost care whenever opening their cooker.\"\nAnd it is a good idea to make sure the cooker is not under anything flamable.\nKamado, Ceramic, and Other\nEgg-style Cookers\nThe kamado or ceramic grill/smoker/oven is a fast growing category with more and more choices every year. With good reason. These versatile charcoal fueled devices are modern versions of the Japanese Kamado, an earthernware cooking urn whose original design is probably at least 3,000 years old. Indian tandoors are similar in concept.\nToday they are made of ceramics, terra cotta, cement, lava rock, and other refractory materials, the kind of stuff used to make kilns and crucibles, all extremely good insulators. If you don't drop them, they last a long time. As champion pitmaster Chris Lilly says of the Komodo Kamado says \"Ask your children what color they want, because they will inherit it.\" Many offer a stand or table in which you can insert the device.\nKamados are extremely versatile because they can be used as a grill, smoker, or tandoor. They can cook low and slow for ribs, pulled pork and brisket, or very hot and fast for steaks. They are superb bread bakers and pizza ovens because the domes absorb heat and radiate it back like a professional brick pizza oven so the pizza and bread can cook properly from above. They are also good for paella . But beware, in order to get a good dark sear on a steak, you need to use a lower grate, and reaching down in can be hazardous.\nThey do look a bit like an ancient burial urn or a giant egg, and the most popular model is called the Big Green Egg. Easy to start in all wind and weather conditions, the insulation means that they need very little charcoal or airflow, even in winter. They are so well insulated that some can cook as low as 150\u00b0F and the interior absorbs and radiates heat so evenly that they are very good at holding steady temps. There are no flareups, and temperature control is easy once you get the hang of it with intake dampers down low and outflow dampers on the top (wear gloves). The design of these dampers is an important differentiator between models. Some work better than others. But get a kamado started, bring it to temp, and there's no need to touch it until the meat is ready.\nKeeping the temp down can be tricky. Dennis Linkletter of Komodo Kamado showed me a trick: Fill the charcoal basket, and bury one Weber paraffin firestarter cube\nin the pile of charcoal and light it. It will ignite about 5 briquets immediately around it. They will burn slowly producing very little heat, and the combustion will spread to unlit coals slowly.\nKamados can soak up a lot of heat, and once they are hot they are very slow to cool because they hold so much heat, so if you overshoot your target temp, it takes a while to get back to where you want it. Sterling Ball of BigPoppaSmokers.com says \"It's like stopping a semi. You've got to brake early.\"\nIf you need to add coals while it is cooking, on some models you need to remove the food, the racks, and the deflector plate, a bit of a pain, but you may not need to add coals for most cooks. By the way, some manufacturers warn that you should not cook with logs on these babies. Do not use lighter fluid to start your charcoal in these babies. It can get into the pourous interior and damage it. But you would never use a petrochemical to light your grill would you? You are always use a chimney or electric starter, right?\nWhen you are done cooking, close the dampers, and it is easy to starve the coals and you have leftover coals for the next cook. The interior is more or less self cleaning so it does not need to be scrubbed. In fact, wire brushes can damage the surface. The only cleanup is for the grates.\nSome manufacturers claim they are huggable when hot. Don't you believe it. Maybe at low temps, but crank 'er up and you dasn't put your hand on the surface. Yes it is cooler than a steel grill, but not huggable.\nThey are fragile and you do not want to knock them over, so you probably don't want to take them to tailgate parties. Besides, they are heavy so they are not very portable. Some have vents in the top that will let in rain, so owners fashion little covers or umbrellas for them. Although you can insert a deflector plate above the coals to convert them into an indirect convection heat cooker, the biggest problem is that the round ones cannot be set up for two heat zones , an essential grilling technique. Having a hot and cool zone is crucial for managing doneness and for searing. Only the oval shaped Primo can be easily set up in two zones.\nBecause they are expensive many of the manufacturers sell them bare bones and a lot of necessities are extra. For example, most of them offer as optional a ceramic disk that you can place between the coals and the food for indirect convection cooking, in my book essential for a lot of recipes. So when shopping, make sure you are clear on exactly what is included and what is not.\nDid I mention that they can be very expensive? Here they are, listed alphabetically. - Meathead\nBayou Classic Cypress Grill\nWe have read too many complaints from users about about the firebox cracking, even shattering into pieces to waste much space on this one. However well or badly they are made, the company's website doesn't inspire confidence in the product or the company itself. We suggest turning your attention to one of its better-established competitors. - Scot Murphy\nBig Green Egg\nThe Big Green Egg is the most popular of the ceramic cookers, and it was the first in the US market. It has a devoted following of enthusiastic users.\nMade in Mexico the BGE design is simple, it is built to last, and it has a limited lifetime warranty.\nThe exterior has an easy-to-clean green glaze bonded to the ceramic. The manufacturer claims that the modern ceramic material will not become brittle and can withstand 2,000\u00b0F, but we wouldn't recommend knocking it over on a concrete patio.\nThe base holds an inner fire pit in the bottom of which is a charcoal grate. There's a sliding damper on the outside for air to enter below the charcoal.\nAbove the fire pit is a fire ring, and that's where the cooking grate rests. There are two metal bands that go around the circumference of the outside of the base and the lid and they are hinged together. Optional side tables can be attached to the bands. The lips of the lid and the base are covered with special felt for a good tight seal. On top of the lid there is a topper that controls exhaust and an optional \"Dual Function Metal Top\" with a dial that allows for more precise air control.\nThere are five sizes. The smallest is the Mini Egg, a one or two person 30-pound cooker with a 9\" diameter grate that can make a large steak or a couple of pork chops. The Small Egg has a 13\" diameter grid, the Medium Egg a 15\" grid, and the Large Egg an 18\" diameter grill, all the way up to the XL Egg, which boasts a very good 452 square inch cooking surface that can handle two turkeys. It also weighs 205 pounds, so plan ahead on how you'll move it. This is made a little easier by their \"nests\" and tables, the supports made to hold the Egg. The tables are made of cypress, which is resistant to insect damage, and can be gotten for the XL down to Small sizes. The nests are metal frames in which the Eggs sit, with casters optional. Side shelves are available if you don\u2019t want to buy the whole table, also.\nThere is a device called the \"Plate Setter\" for all sizes except the Mini. It's a flat ceramic disk that sits directly over the charcoal. It absorbs and radiates heat so you have indirect radiant heat, but there is still no way to get convection heat as you can by pushing the fire to the side on the Primo.\nThe plate also prevents grease from spattering during the cook, which changes the flavor, according to its fans, to a much cleaner, less bitter flavor.\nEggs are versatile. For regular barbecue, it's almost a set-it-and-forget-it device. With accessories such as an upper grate, one could easily cook burgers or steaks on the primary grate, and roast corn or potatoes on the upper grate. Shoot, think of the joys of a Brazilian-style churrascaria or some long shrimp kebabs, all standing vertically in a circle around the small, superhot fire.\nThe vents can be left open for hotter cooking, or closed nearly shut to keep your charcoal smoldering for hours. They say that if you set it up properly you will not need to add charcoal for 24 hours during a typical 225\u00b0F cooking session. You could put a pork shoulder in with a small amount of lit charcoal on top of some unlit charcoal, close it, and come back in 12 hours to a succulent clod of pulled pork. If you do have to add charcoal, you must lift out the meat and the grate to do it. That's a bit of a pain.\nThere's a dedicated forum of BGE users and it has a wealth of information like this: Tighten the bolts on the stands after the Egg has been used five times; if you have a problem with grease sticking the felt shut when it's cold, slip a Weber paraffin charcoal lighter cube in the bottom and wait for the warmth to release the opening. Then change the gaskets.\nReplacements for all parts are easily available. On the negative side, we have heard that gaskets need to be replaced after a few years, parts are expensive, and that customer service could be better.\nEggs are not sold on the internet and their prices are not quoted on the net (hint: They are not cheap). You have to locate a dealer and call. Click here for more info: Big Green Egg . - Scot Murphy\nBroil King Keg\na.k.a. BSK a.k.a. Big Steel Keg a.k.a. Bubba Keg\nThey've changed the name and design on this baby so many times, I'm not sure what it is today and I cannot swear that this description is accurate. Made in Canada, this is not a fragile ceramic kamado, but an insulated steel kamado for less money than the ceramics.\nThe interior is almost exactly the same size as the Big Green Egg, and many BGE accessories fit it. There is a cast iron grill grate and an upper grate made of wire that can swing out of the way. The numbered positions on the dampers are a good idea that helps you learn the settings. BSK has two plastic side shelves with tool hooks, it is mounted on a cart with big wheels, the gasket is reported to last long, the food grate is adjustable, and, fitting for a cooker once named Bubba, there are bottle openers mounted on the hood handle. Best of all, you can get a trailer hitch attachment for it. Perfect for tailgating! - Meathead\nGourmetPots\nGrill Dome\nA story came with my visit to look at the Grill Dome Kamado-style charcoal grill. As I remarked on the well-used Dome on display and how beautiful the finish was on the outside, looking almost brand-new despite its heavy use, the manager of the store (Bell Appliance and Parts in Valparaiso, IN) told me something extraordinary. They've been selling these for a few years now, but two or three years ago a couple had been returned. The paint finish had blistered and started flaking off. The salesman for the company took back the rest of them. Then came delays in getting new ones. When Bell finally talked to the salesman responsible for the area, he said he had put all sales on hold until the paint problem had been fixed to his satisfaction. What does this tell you? It tells me that this is a company determined to meet a high standard, not just to take your money. That single act says a lot of good about this company.\nAs to the grill itself: It is substantial. It would take a hefty shove to knock one over, even without the stand. The small, medium, and large grills have cooking grids that are 12.5\", 15\", and 18\" in diameter. The largest, the SuperDome, has a 22\u201d grill, but is not available online. The small weighs 80 pounds, the medium 110, the large 175, and the SuperDome 280. Grill Dome does not come with a built-in thermometer, which is just fine; you're always better off using your own, more accurate, digital grill thermometer . The ceramic is Grill Dome's own creation, called Terapex, which they claim is twice as thick as others and can allow temperatures up to 200\u00b0F higher than other Kamado-type grills. The upper vent is a pivoting steel disk rather than a dial-type of vent, which can be less finely controlled and a small problem if you need to move it during a cook.\nThe lower damper is a sliding affair, and it is through this that you sweep out ash. Consistent with other kamados, they are stingy on charcoal use while producing plenty of heat, all kept in with the thick, insulating ceramic and sealed by industrial felt on both lip and base.\nWhat is also noteworthy is the thought that went into their accessories. Not just the strong stand and sturdy side shelf (each sold separately); it has an additional, three-footed upper rack which can be turned upside-down and used instead of the primary cooking grate, giving you a smaller cooking area but much closer to the coals for a good sear. Perhaps best of all is that they promise no assembly: Uncrate it, and a few minutes later you can be cooking. Partner all of this with their 5 year warranty on gaskets (some have only 30 days), their lifetime warranty on the rest (including the hinges), and this can be an investment you'll be enjoying for many years. - Scot Murphy\nH\u00f4mdoor Tandoori\nHere's some delicious irony: Instead of reporting on yet another grill being made overseas, here we have an Indian tandoor being made in the heartland of America. Deep in the hills of Ohio, the Superior Clay Corporation manufactures the Homdoor Tandoor, a new object of desire for the outdoor cook. The only tandoor manufacturing company that we know of in the US, it started when the owner, Ron Levy, a renowned ceramicist, was challenged by a New York City restaurant owner to make a commercial tandoor. He and his wife and business partner, Beth Kaminstein, approached Superior Clay. A bounty of collaboration, work, and design produced the Homdoor, a free-standing tandoor oven perfect for your deck, your patio, or your backyard.\nA tandoor is a traditional Indian clay oven which cooks meats and veggies on skewers, placed vertically into an open, upright cylindrical oven, and roasted at very high temperatures for a fairly short time. Design, craftsmanship, and location have all come together in this tough, beautiful cooker.\nThe Homdoor has three layers: The stainless steel outer shell, a thick \"cementitious\" natural clay insulating layer, and the inner clay cooking surface. It so happens that this part of middle-west Ohio has a kind of clay which, in terms of porosity and strength and resistance to thermal shock, is perfect for high-temperature tandoor cooking. The thick insulating layer has more than one purpose. Retaining heat like crazy - when the inside temperature was near 500\u00b0F, the stainless steel shell was only 84\u00b0 - the insulating layer also protects your investment from cracking.\nThe inner chamber is not strictly cylindrical, having an outward bulge (\"belly\") at the middle that traps heat and moisture. Unlike some kamados, the interior is not porcelain-coated or glazed, as that would prevent Indian naan or roti breads from sticking to the chamber walls where it bakes. Bonded to the insulating layer, the liner will continue to hold together and cook despite the inevitable crack. Just a hairline crack might begin the end to your Kamado-style cooker, but it will barely affect the Homdoor, they claim.\nIn the bottom of the cooking chamber is a cast iron charcoal grate, and there are no cooking grates. The ash chamber in the bottom is serviced through a well-designed combination door and slide damper that helps control airflow. Starting the charcoal is a breeze: Put two or three pounds of charcoal atop the charcoal grate, and place crumpled paper in the ash chamber below it. Light the paper underneath, lid off and damper wide open, and the charcoal directly above it will catch. A good old trick is to spray the paper with a little vegetable oil first, getting the heat up where it catches the charcoal easily. An aluminum lid with a thin, stay-cool handle tops it off and is also used to control airflow.\nThe Homdoor is almost ready for cooking right out of the box. Though the steps are simple, you will need two people to put it together because the parts are extremely heavy. Overall, it\u2019s 32\" high and 26.5\" wide (counting the handles), with a 28\" diameter base. The cooking chamber itself is 13.75\" in diameter (16\" in the belly) and 16\" deep. Now, here's what makes the easy-to-assemble design of the Homdoor truly innovative: You can switch from charcoal to propane! The propane version of the Homdoor includes a 16-jet burner that can generate up to 100,000 BTU. That's a lot of BTU. Converting it is this simple: open the damper door, clean out any ashes, place the burner in the center of the ash chamber, tuck the neck of the burner into a small, cleverly designed notch, and close the damper door. There. That's it. The neck of the burner has the propane hookup extending a few inches from the barrel where you can easily attach your tank's hose, and ther'\u2019s no effect on airflow. Easy peasy.\nThe learning curve for cooking meats is short and shallow. Put meat on the skewers, saving an onion or potato chunk for last to keep the meat from sliding off the skewer into the fire, lower the skewers into the fire, and you can get tender, juicy, seared meat in four to eight minutes. Vegetables are especially good; for example, sweet pepper. Skewered like a kebab, the pepper comes out hot, seared, and yet still crisp and full of flavor.\nThe learning curve for making naan or roti is steeper. You will find it challenging to get the dough consistency and the technique down, but you get to eat your mistakes. With just a little innovation and skill of your own, the tandoor can also be used to make shawarma, gyros, or even a version of Korean-style barbecued ribs. And it's easy to clean, needing only a soapless scrubbing with a stiff-bristled (not wire) brush.\nIncluded with the Homdoor are several skewers, which hang on a rod encircling the upper outside of the chamber, as well as a gaddi pad used for placing naan on the oven surface, and a pair of bread tools. Like I said, there's a learning curve. After seeing the kinds of charcoal used, it seems that the best for this is mesquite hardwood lump charcoal. It burns faster and uses more fuel, true, but it can get a good couple of hundred degrees hotter in a tandoor than oak lump charcoal and really improve your food's sear while locking in flavor and moisture. Additionally, improvements and new options for the Homdoor are in the plans. The owners discussed the possibility of an optional lid with hooks and a dial damper for hanging racks of ribs or brisket and cooking low-and-slow, so that design looks likely to be in the works soon. They also mentioned designing a pizza stone.\nThis cooker is a big investment. The charcoal version is around $1,300, the propane version near $1,500, and the natural gas version just a little over $1,500. The only downside to the Homdoor is that outside of manufacturing defects or shipping accidents, which they say they will gladly make good on, there is no warranty. On the one hand, it speaks to their confidence in their cooker that they feel a warranty isn't necessary; on the other hand, worrywarts like me are used to stuff falling apart in our throwaway culture. You can be assured, though, that this is designed to last, to be rugged, and to be beautiful.

They talk about frozen top dampers that break into pieces, tiles that crumble off, and poor quality \"ceramic\". One forum is in itself something you must take with a grain of salt; a lot of anger and pettiness are going on.\nThat being said, there are some kamado.com owners who are pleased with their products. The possibility exists that someone may buy one of them, be treated well, and receive a worthy product. But the anti-kamado.com sentiment is so high and expressed so widely, that we have to suggest looking above and below if you want a ceramic cooker. - Scot Murphy\nKamado Joe\nHere's an elegant beast of a ceramic cooker, with heft and insulation and the space to cook for a family. There are many good things to like about this grill and smoker, and the first is the craft with which it has been built. You might hope that for such a price (under $800 not including a stand), it had better be put together well. Kamado Joe delivers.\nFirst, the heft of this makes it genuine and powerful. Just lift the lid. There's no wiggle, no wobble, and no doubt that the well-machined stainless steel hinge will keep the heavy lid up. It moves with ease, yet there's no doubt as to the weight and strength of it. The ceramic shell is a terra cotta-like material, and the inner fire pit and charcoal ring are built to withstand a lot of cooks. In the bottom is a charcoal grate made of powder-coated cast iron, and near the top is the 304 grade stainless steel grilling grate. The 18\" diameter grate gives 256 square inches of cooking space, and the stainless steel expander \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a second grate with three feet that sits above the primary grate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 gives you 407 square inches of surface. The main grate is hinged so you don't have to remove it (and food) to add coals if needed.\nIt\u2019s 48\" tall, which includes the lid, so without a stand it sits a little low. One thing I like is the top vent, which has a dial function, giving you finer control over the air flow, or you can pivot the entire cast-iron circle to the side to let the air flow wide open. That can make a very big difference in planning out your cooking time, giving you that much more precision. At the bottom front is a side-sliding damper for air intake that is also the door through which you scrape out the ash. I'm told by the fine people at the Wabash, Indiana True Value hardware that the hook comes with the purchase. This is a hefty 188 pounds, so plan on having a friend help you get it set up. It also comes with the obligatory grill-lid thermometer, though as always, we suggest getting your own, more accurate, digital grill thermometer . You will probably want to get the metal stand for this: it\u2019s well-designed in that it\u2019s almost invisible, but it has the strength it needs.\nThe side shelves are good \u00e2\u0080\u0094 bamboo on the red KJ, teak on the black. Ditto for the wooden handle. The glaze is thick and beautiful and looks tough. The shelves fold down to get them out of the way and have the sturdiness to handle the next platter of burgers or platter of condiments. The warranty can\u2019t be beat: 20 years on the ceramics, five years for the non-cast iron metal parts, one year for the cast iron parts, and 30 days on thermometers and felt gaskets.\nIf I have one complaint, one tiny complaint, the utensil pins (not hooks) on the left side shelf are inconvenient, tucked under the lip of the wooden slats of the shelf, without a hook or flange of some sort to keep your utensils from being knocked off. That wouldn't stop me from buying one though. - Scot Murphy\nKomodo Kamado\nThis may be the most striking cooker in the world and I have one on my patio for testing at the moment, so watch this space for more info.\nThere are two sizes, a Gen 2.2 Ultimate and a Lil' Isla. The Gen 2.2 Ultimate has a 23\" wide top grate, stands 50.5\" high, 30\" wide at the base, and is 36\" deep. It weighs a whopping 534 pounds. The Lil' Isla has a 19.5\" upper grate and weighs \"only\" 462 pounds. They arrive fully assembled, but you might need help getting it out of the crate and into position.\nThe first thing you notice is how well built this zaftig sweetheart is. From the serious 304 stainless steel spring assisted hinge assembly for the easy-open lid, to the fingertip release latch, to the beautifully inlaid tiles. The casters are large enough to roll this beast across bumpy brick pavers. The cooking grates and charcoal basket are thick 3/8\" 304 stainless rods, and the upper grate is hinged so you can add more charcoal without removing the food.\nThe air inflow damper at the bottom is a rotating dial, and the entire assembly slides out easily if you want to allow max airflow. The upper damper looks like a helmet, and you turn it on a screw to lift it and allow hot air and smoke out. This is fairly precise and it keeps rain out, but it is prety easy to lose track of how many spins you've given it. Airflow can also be managed with a digital controller like Rock's Stoker thermostat or a BBQ Guru and it comes with a port designed for them. There is a hole drilled in the dome for a dial thermometer, and a port on the side at grate level for digital probe cables. Although the Tel-Tru bi-metal dial thermometer that comes with it is pretty close to accurate at low temps, it is way off at high temps. This is one of the few cookers I've used where the dome thermometer is anywhere close to accurate. As usual I recommend you get a good digital grill thermometer .\nBoth units have mounts for rotisseries, can be fitted with side tables, and there is a pizza stone available, too. The 23\" model has three racks, an upper, middle, and lower, and the lower can be positioned right on top of the coals for max heat searing. It can even be fitted with a gas igniter.\nOne might be concerned that the tiles will need extra maintenance. Apparently they are not held in with a normal grout. The manufacturer claims it is elastomeric so it expands and contracts with heat and it is said to be UV resistant so it does not require any maintenance. If you knock a tile loose, the manufacturer ships the unit with a repair kit.\nThe 2\" thick sandwich of two refractory materials is like concrete. Like almost all kamodos, I just wish it was oval shaped like the Primo so one could set up a 2-Zone or Indirect system, an essential grilling technique. If you have the deflector plate in place for indirect heat and you want to sear a steak or sizzle on a sauce over direct heat, you have to remove the food and the hot deflector.\nYou can start the coals by simply dumping them in the coal basket and lighting them with a Weber parafin block from below or some bunched up newspaper. Many owners use small torches to fire up in a hurry. Or you can use a chimney, my preferred method so I can measure the amount of coal.\nManaging temp is relatively easy once you get the hang of it. The manufacturer recommends that you always fill the charcoal basket, even if you are cooking at a low temp, and control the temp with the air vents. It will take a little practice to learn what settings get you where you want to go, especailly since the first hour is spend getting those thick walls loaded with heat. When you give 'er all she's got, Scotty, she can easily surpass 700\u00b0F, especially with lump charcoal, not because it burns hotter, but because it has better airflow through the irregular chunks.\nOnce you hit a target temp, man, she is rock solid with all that mass holding that heat and radiating it back slowly. Surprisingly, it is very responsive to the slightest increase in oxygen supply, a tweak to the vent openings, top or bottom, and within minutes the temp starts to climb. It is a bit less responsive to shutting down oxygen supply because of all that thermal mass, but it does choke down nicely.\nMinor issues: The handles on the grates are almost flush against the interior making it awkward to grip them unless you turn your hands so your thumbs face you; the lid handle can get hot when cooking with the lid open because it hovers right above the cooking surface; and the latch has a nasty habit of smashing my finger if I close the lid too quickly. All these are niggling things that you can easily work around once you get used to them.\nThis is a top choice for low and slow smoke roasting and for large cuts of meat, but it is not my first choice for recipes that call for moving from indirect to direct because removing the deflector plate when food is on is a bit of a hassle.\nDepending on how you get it tricked out, the typical price is about $3,000 for the small one and $4,000 for the large one, lifetime warranty on everything included. The Komodo Kamado website has a lively message board with tips on technique. Click here for more info and pricing: Komodo Kamado . - Meathead\nPrimo Grills\nThe American-made Primo's oval shape is unique and a special advantage over all other kamado types. The oval is better than the round shape because it allows you to put coals on one side for a hot zone and leave the other side cooler. This technique, called 2-Zone or Indirect Cooking is a cornerstone of good grilling.\nThere are two models, the Jr. and the XL. Both have the oval shape, and a clever upper vent that is a pivoting, cast-iron disk. You can dial it for subtle air control, or you can move the entire vent cap aside to leave the vent wide open. The lower intake vent is a precision fitted stainless steel left-to-right slide allowing fingertip air control. This is new for 2011.\nThe left and right grates have legs on one side. With the legs up, you can cook an inch or two closer to the coals. Turn them over and put the legs down, and you can raise the grates those couple of inches. Two grates means you can cook on two different levels.\nThey both have an effective unyielding spring-loaded lid hinge that makes it easy to lift the heavy dome, a thick felt gasket for sealing the two halves, ceramic insulation, energy efficiency, easy cleanout, solid porcelain-coated steel grates, and a built-in dial thermometer in the dome that tells the temp in the dome, not on the grate where the food is. As always, we suggest getting your own, more accurate, digital grill thermometer .\nThere are plenty of accessories: Pizza stones, ceramic deflectors that keep grease off the fire as well as capturing and radiating the heat more evenly, a firebox divider for indirect cooking, extra racks that can give you as many as four different heights, rib racks, chicken \"sitters\", a cart, and more.\nThe optional table is a beautiful piece of work, allowing for a lot of prep work and side-cook items. If you prefer, there is a smaller, less expensive metal cart. It also comes with movable ceramic feet if you want it standing on its own. But that's the problem we have with the Primo. So much of what makes it great comes at additional cost. Even the ash hook, a useful tool for scraping ash in the bottom out through the lower damper, is extra.\nWe have only one major complaint: You can't lower the grates to directly above the coals for a better crunchy sear. Otherwise, this is an excellent example of American workmanship. Built to last many years, the ceramic has a 20-year limited warranty and the metal has a 5-year warranty. Care for it properly and this could be your best cooker for many years.\nThe Primo website has a user forum where owners can solve problems and exchange ideas.\nPromo Oval Jr. This one is perfect if you appreciate quality and versatility and you live in a smallish spot with a smallish balcony or yard. At 95 pounds it has 210 square cooking inches on its primary surface. It has an optional extending rack that sits on the primary and extends your cooking surface to 360 square inches. With only the primary racks, it has enough space for a small turkey.\nPrimo Oval XL. This is the big brother and it is a very very nice cooker. It has everything that the little brother has, only more of it. It has heft (192 pounds) and 400 square inches of grate, comparable to the big Weber Kettles, but with rack extensions can get up to 680 inches. - Scot Murphy\nSaffire Grill & Smoker\nSimilar in design and concept to the other egg shaped kamados, the most unique feature of the Saffire is an optional slot in the front that allows you to feed wood chips without opening the lid and disturbing the critical oxygen balance and hence the temp. Alas, this feature is not standard, and onmost cooks, you should not need to add more wood than you add when you add the food. Another differentiator is that all metal is stainless steel except the charcoal grate which is durable cast iron.\nThe 18\" cooking grate gives you 180 square inches of cooking area with the stainless steel grate set down into the belly of the beast, and you can add another grate increasing the cooking area to 460 square inches. The lower air intake is a sliding door that gives you very good control but removing ash through it is tricky because the opening is small and the floor of the inside is slightly below the door. They sell an optional tool to help.\nThe chimney has a dial cast stainless steel damper with holes and the ability to slide the damper out of the way completely. There is no way to keep rain out of the chimney if it is open. The cooking grate has a hinge that lets you drop in more coals or wood chunks too large for the wood chip slot. The lid and body are held together by a stainless steel hinge with springs attached to stainless steel bands around the girth of each section. The model I looked at did not have a lot of tension on the springs. Although the springs made opening the lid fairly easy, you don't want to let 'er go as you are lowering it or I fear it will come crashing down on the body and shatter one or the other. The felt gaskets between them may cushion the fall, but I fear bad things if you let the lid slip.\nThe stainless steel cart is solid and good looking with locking wheels, and you can purchase winged tables or a beautiful wooden cart with a granite top. It is available in several baked enamel colors and the table is available in several beautiful woods. Other options are the heat deflector for indirect cooking (this really should be standard on all ceramics), a pizza stone, and a steel gizmo that raises the cooking grate to lip level. - Meathead\n"}, {"score": 557.7803, "uuid": "172189dd-7a87-59c0-939c-344591d9d30d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1111wb-47-10191", "target_hostname": "www.dailygrommet.com", "target_uri": "http://www.dailygrommet.com/products/slice-cutting-and-craft-tools", "page_rank": 1.2163643e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Slice Cutters: <em>Ceramic</em> Box Cutters - Paper Cutters - Stainless Scissors", "snippet": "Cotton quilting fabric, to be exact - one <em>or</em> two layers?

The spear, axe and knife can all stab, hack and slice (sometimes with more efficiency, and certainly at less trouble and expense) but the sword has been seen throughout history as a weapon of nobility and magic. It is suitable for swearing oaths on or by. It has been a valued heirloom and a symbol of power to many people in many times and places.\nThe Roman legionnaire probably regarded his sword more as a useful tool than as a mystical symbol. Beyond the care and respect that almost any soldier feels for a reliable and efficient piece of equipment upon which his life depended (and one that stayed at hand, unlike the pilum), the Roman would hew barbarians or brushwood with equal facility. His sword was issued to him. It was usually not an heirloom passed down through the family, nor an award for heroic service, nor was it purchased at great price and embellished with gold. It was just, well... a sword.\nAt the other extreme, the Javanese kris has far more power as a magical talisman, cultural badge and work of art than it has as a weapon. Kris are reputed to leap into the hand when the owner is attacked; to rattle in the scabbard when danger approaches; to sigh in disappointment when sheathed. Many are said to be able to direct flames and help put out house fires, while some are so potent that merely stabbing an enemies foot print will ensure his demise. Meteoric iron is used in some kris not so much for its superior quality or contrasting beauty (although these are valid virtues) but because of its magical associations.\nFor the Japanese the sword was venerated for its symbolic and mystical qualities and some of the finer ones were enshrined in Shinto temples. Today the Japanese sword is seen as a triumph of art and craftsmanship, but during turbulent times the sword smiths could also hammer them out in quantity. One smithy increased its rate of production from one every two weeks to ten a day!\nIn Islam the sword was also highly honored and justly famed for its keenness of edge and strength, the result of the superior steel employed in its forging. (The earliest Islamic swords were very similar to the European broad sword, the familiar scimitar being adapted from Turkic and other steppe tribes.) Damascus became the most famed center of the craft, so that to this day any steel showing a pattern similar to the eutectic steel employed in Islamic swords is called \"damascus\".\nThe northern European broad sword of pattern welded or homogenous construction inhabited the middle ground between the mystic and the utilitarian. Everybody knew stories about wondrous blades forged by god/smiths or giants or dwarves, but very few seemed to know anyone who had them. They would be given names like \"Limb Biter\" or \"Wolf Tooth\" or \"Pierce\" but this was probably more a case of affection for an animistic companion than for any noumenous power that might be invoked. Old swords were valued not the least because only good swords got to be old swords. As Odin says in the Hovamal:\n\"Praise no day 'til evening;\nno wife 'til on her pyre;\nno sword 'til tested;\nno ice 'til crossed;\nno ale 'til drunk.\"\nI can personally attest that there is nothing so embarrassing as standing on the battlefield holding an empty hilt while the blade lies flopped on the grass behind you.\nSECRETS\nAs I started to research this paper I came across a literary gap in the sources (at least as far as European swords are concerned). From Pliny the Elder (+AD79) until the 17th century the sources are remarkably tight lipped. The reason for this is that knowledge of smelting, forging and tempering techniques were important trade secrets to be kept within the confines of the family, guild or town. The market for a superior product could only be controlled if the resources and techniques were closely held. Others may stumble upon superior methods and products through empirical experimentation, but that was no reason to give it away. For a modern parallel observe the despairing reaction of any Marklandic blacksmith upon learning that another has taken up the hammer. The knowledge is available in the library, good steel litters the landscape as scrap, and the competition for a somewhat limited market is fierce.\nTHE PROPERTIES OF THE SWORD\nThe sword was a high technology weapon in its day. A spear could stab and if the point bent a bit on a bone you could work around it. An axe might be a bit heavy, but it was sturdy and powerful and one well directed blow could put an end to the most intractable dispute. The mace and, its variations, relied on brute, crushing force. None of these weapons required the amount and quality of valuable metal that the sword did. The physical requirements of the sword were special. It had to be long yet strong, hard and sharp yet tough, flexible yet sturdy. Think of it as a cold chisel with a cutting edge 30 inches long. As opposed to the swords used in recreation and thespian battles today, the edges were well sharpened, the better to cleave metal, leather and cloth armor. One of the Norse sagas recounts a king who had several mysterious, heavy chests hauled aboard before sailing off to a sea battle. At the crux of the battle, when he observed his men wearying and the swords not biting-in, he opened the chests to reveal newly sharpened swords, which were rapidly issued to the seamen. (Cutting steel with a dull chisel is no fun, and if you were to use a sword as an impact weapon a mace would do better. Interesting enough, against unarmored opponents, a sword could be too sharp. During the Indian Wars the U. S. Cavalry troops were ordered not to sharpen their sabers since the sharp ones tended to cleave into and get stuck in the bone.)\nTo stay sharp a sword had to be hard, but the harder it is the more brittle it tends to be.\nLet's step back here and deal with the materials at this point.\nWROUGHT IRON: .00% to .04% (4 pts.) carbon, 3% silica.\nCharacteristics: soft, malleable, welds easily, resists burning in the forge, resists rust, when bent tends to stay bent.\nSTEEL: .04% (4 pts.) to 2.25% (225 pts.) carbon. Most modern steel runs from 20 point \"mild steel\" to 150 point \"tool steel\". Steel has a low silica content and usually various trace metals. In the period we are dealing with these trace metals were accidental. In the modern period they are intentional, creating various alloys for different purposes. Intentional or accidental, they will affect the performance of the steel, and ores containing different elements were used for different tools or weapons. Trial and error works even when you don't know why something works.\nCharacteristics: harder, less malleable, difficult to weld, easy to burn in the forge, rusts, tends towards springiness, shatters when over-hardened, cracks when worked at wrong temperature - all in proportion to its carbon content.\nCAST IRON: Up to 8% impurities including 3.5% to 4.25% carbon, plus phosphorus, silica etc.\nCharacteristics: hard, brittle, non-malleable, casts in liquid form, heat resistant, withstands compression, rusts, doesn't weld at all. Cast iron is produced (in useable quantities) by high heat blast furnaces.\nSo here is the basic problem: wrought iron, available in classical and early medieval Europe, makes dandy door hinges but lousy swords. It won't hold an edge, it bends and deforms; it's actually worse than bronze. Cast iron, available in Asia because of the design of their smelting furnaces and the use of coal, won't work very well either. It is much too brittle. Only steel achieves the required balance of qualities, but there is no easy and sure way to smelt it in quantity. Further, it requires special techniques to create a reliable weapon in the high-stress environment that a sword must operate in,\nIn the next sections I will go in depth into how separate societies with similar levels of technology solved this problem to create swords for defense, for beauty and for respect, honor or veneration.\nPART II\nMethods of Construction\nThere are seven methods of construction that we will deal with in the next several parts of this paper, so I will take this opportunity to list them and then explain them at length while describing their manufacture and the characteristics of the processes. They are: natural alloy iron, simple laminated welding, pattern welding, homogeneous tempered steel, crucible wootz steel, infused wootz steel, and complex laminated welding.\nRoman Swords\nEarly blades of almost pure iron could be work-hardened to some extent, just as bronze was. The constant and skillful pounding of the smith's hammer tended to compact the mass, but overdoing this could lead to brittleness. These swords were no better than, and frequently inferior to, bronze. But iron ores were relatively plentiful as opposed to copper and tin, which were both more rare and widely dispersed. Interruption of trade for any reason would prevent the accumulation of either or both copper and tin and immediately halt further manufacture of bronze. Iron ore was not only more plentiful than those metals, but the other needed ingredient to smelt it -charcoal- stood in rich supply in the forests that blanketed Europe.\nStill, work-hardened iron was hardly the ideal material for weapons. But the advantage of having an empire is that you have a wide range of both human talent and material resources. We, unfortunately, know little of the talent involved in the making of their swords, but the end result indicates that it was more than competent. In terms of resources the main secret of the Roman sword was the quality of the ore from which the metal was smelted. These natural alloys were employed in tools, weapons or hardware according to their various virtues. The occurrence of manganese, nickel and tungsten in these ores benefited the hardness and toughness of the finished metal with manganese especially adding to the ability to work harden the edge.\nInterestingly enough Pliny the Elder attributes these superior properties not to the quality of the ore or the skill of the regional craftsmen but to the qualities of the water that they were quenched in. This is either a classic case of disinformation to obscure the processes used from the competition or reflects the tenacious belief that the constitution of the quenching medium is of the utmost importance to the quality of the finished object.\n\"Magic\" waters, secret formulas, milk, butter, wax, gusts of cold air, blood, and even (legendarily) living slaves were used to quench swords in the pursuit of both physical and magical virtue. In truth, all that a quenching medium does is to control the rate of cooling and therefore the hardness and temper of a blade. Water, with a low boiling point, cools quickly; brine will cool slightly faster (a point still in contention in several modern books which insist that brine cools more slowly); and oil cools slower. The results of the cooling rate will be discussed further on, but suffice it to say that you can get pretty much the same quenching performance from a barrel of tepid brine as opposed to plunging a red hot blade into a living slave, and at far less pain, expense and spiritual peril. It has also been noticed that the poor slave would tend to writhe a bit, which might put a bit of twist in the blade.\nBeyond regional ores the Romans would also import wootz steel from India via the Levant. Of course, in keeping with the normal level of subterfuge, the Romans were led to believe that these small (2 to 5 lbs.) ingots originated in China along with the silk they so eagerly sought. These ingots were apparently devoted exclusively to swords, daggers, shears or other cutting implements and were considered both high class and high priced.\nFrom at least the first century the Romans also employed laminated and complex pattern welding in some of their swords, a technique apparently devised by the Celts at about, or shortly before, this time.\nTHE NORTHERN EUROPEANS\nIn the north as in Rome the primary source of iron and steel was the bloomery furnace: a fairly simple device that relied on natural draft, prevailing winds or minimal bellows to supply the air to raise the temperature of the fire enough to reduce the oar to a mass of metal and slag, but not so much as to oxidize or melt the mass. In its early form it was a wide, low chimney with an opening at the bottom for feeding in air and manipulating the bloom. It was filled from the top with semi-mixed layers of ore and charcoal (and eventually limestone or some other appropriate flux to carry off or absorb impurities). The ore could consist of some high quality natural alloy with a nice proportion of manganese to strengthen it and remove impurities such as sulfur, phosphorus, and arsenic; or it could be plain old (and ever popular) bog iron (limonite). Bog iron is formed by bacterial action precipitating it from solution in the water. If the bog remains undisturbed the limonite will replenish itself in about twenty years. (If the local well water tasted heavily of iron, then the ore was probably pretty good; but if it tasted of sulfur, that might not be a good sign.) Limonite also occurs in \"fossil\" form, where a bog may once have existed.\nNow, if you carefully controlled your proportions and air flow and heat, the carbon in the charcoal would cause the iron to start to aggregate as the oxygen of the iron oxide was consumed in the reducing conditions of the fire and changed to carbon monoxide. Some impurities would burn away and others would melt as slag (taking a lot of iron with it). Eventually you would get a large, red hot, lumpish mass consisting mostly of iron with some silica. You would either drag this out of the front of the furnace or dismantle the furnace to get at it, depending upon the design. You would then take this \"bloom\", weighing from 5 to 50 pounds, lay it on a large flat rock or anvil and have three large friends with sledge hammers beat the ever-living aspirations and most of the silica and remaining impurities out of it until you were left with a large bar shaped piece of wrought iron; good for door hinges but not so great for swords.\nHowever, if you got careless or curious or distracted and put in too much charcoal, and you pumped the bellows too hard or the wind came up unexpectedly, and you kept feeding it and let it run longer than usual a funny thing would start to happen. At about 2400 degrees F the iron would start to absorb the carbon. Now when the bloom was removed from the furnace, those portions that hadn't absorbed the carbon would work like wrought iron. Those portions that had absorbed too much carbon would turn into cast iron, either to melt away in the slag or to shatter as the cooling mass was hammered into a billet.\nThe metal between these two extremes was steel (or \"hard iron\" in the classical period). It looked different and worked different since the higher the carbon content the more \"stiffly\" it worked. Steel could be hardened and tempered, and it didn't take that much carbon to give a good cutting edge. Several cutting implements such as axes and chisels from the Mastermyr find were analyzed and the cutting edges were found to be only 40 pt. steel. This is low by modern standards but if you were to graph out the maximum quenched hardness of steel against the carbon content, you would notice a peculiar phenomenon: 10 pt. steel has a hardness on the Rockwell \"C\" scale of about 38; at 20 pts. the hardness is about 50, at 30 pts. it's about 58, and at 40 pts. the maximum hardness is about 61. From 40 pts. to 100 pts. the steel only gains about 7 more Rockwell \"C\" scale points in maximum hardness as the curve levels out.\nIn terms of an axe with a 40 pt. cutting edge laid into it, this would mean that you may have to sharpen it more often, but it would still have the hardness of the steel and the durability and toughness of the wrought iron. You might not even have to temper it at this range.\nThere are now two courses that you could take to make the sword. One is to accumulate enough of the right grade of steel to create a uniform, homogenous billet out of which to forge the blade. The other is to try to take several grades of steel and wrought iron and forge them into a sword so as to take advantage of their diverse properties.\nBoth types of swords were used throughout the early medieval period. Of some 142 swords from the 5th through the 10th centuries, discovered in England and X-rayed by the British Museum, some 64% were patterned welded. A partial breakdown showed that pattern welded blades made up 44% of the finds in the 5th through 6th centuries, 77% in the 6th century, 100% in the 7th century, and was back down to 45% in the 9th through 10th centuries.\n(from: Swords of the Anglo Saxon and Viking Periods in the British Museum: A Radiographic Study)\nHOMOGENEOUS STEEL SWORDS\nWe will deal with the homogenous steel sword first. Starting with an appropriate size steel billet of suitable carbon content (Probably about 60 pts. Too little carbon would lack the springiness as well as the hardness required; too much would be too brittle.) the metal is heated and the blade and tang are drawn out by hammering to sword-like proportions. A groove was frequently fullered down the midsection of the blade to both strengthen and lighten the blade in relation to its width. (This fuller is sometimes called a \"blood gutter\" today, but that's probably a bit of Victorian Romanticism. It's basically the same principle that tin roofs and corrugated cardboard rely upon for stiffness.) The sword is then brought to a smoother finish and the hammer marks removed by filing and/or the use of a grindstone. When all is ready except the final sharpening the blade is hardened and tempered.\nThere are two methods of doing this: In the first the blade is heated to a cherry red and then plunged into a cooling medium, let's say brine. Assuming that the thermal shock is not too violent (which would either shatter the blade or leave stress cracks) the blade is now at maximum hardness, but also at maximum brittleness. This is where tempering comes in. The sword is carefully re-heated to reduce the internal stress and brittleness while retaining a sufficient degree of hardness.\nTempering, of itself, is proof of a benevolent Deity: for as the metal is heated the surface is oxidized and reflects different colors at different temperatures. Starting with pale yellow at 420 degrees it goes to straw (470), bronze (500), purple (540), dark blue (590), and steel gray (650). When you get to gray the temper is completely drawn and you have undone your hardening.\nDepending upon how much carbon is in the metal and the use to which it is to be put, you chose the appropriate color to heat to. The result of drawing to a bronze in 100 pt. steel would be quite different than in 40 pt. steel. In the case of the sword of 60 pts.: a good blue will probably do the job.\nThe other method is to vary the speed of the quenching. This may have been done by coating the center portion of the blade with clay or some other insulating material. When the blade is quenched the clay slows down the coolin4 of the center portion leaving the sword with hard edges but a softer, tougher center. Whether medieval European swordsmiths ever used this technique will remain speculative until comprehensive examination of the blades take place. There is no reason why it wouldn't work, (as it still does for the Japanese and several modern swordsmiths) and it may well have been one of those \"trade secret\" techniques.\nThere are several potential problems with making and using a homogenous blade of uncertain steel: It may be hard to come by enough of the proper steel. Any oversized silica or slag inclusion would weaken the blade, leading to breakage. Because of the uniformity of the metal repeated blows in use could (in theory) work harden portions of it, leading to brittleness or breakage\nfrom metal fatigue. Finally, it's not as \"fancy\" looking as a pattern welded blade.\nPATTERN WELDED SWORDS\nThe pattern welded blade is formed of strips and bars of varying carbon content, twisted and welded into a unified whole. The problem with pattern welding is that welding is a very touchy operation. Wrought iron enters the semi-liquid welding stage at about 2,500 degrees and starts to burn at about 2,750 degrees while the range for 100 pt. steel is between about 2,200 and 2,600 degrees. This leaves a very narrow range in which to weld one to the other; and over a forge fire only the critical eye of the smith could judge the right time to strike. Once the carbon in the steel started to burn it was all over and the piece could well be ruined. Skill and experience are the key factors.\nThere were at least a good dozen patterns used, and the permutations are endless, so I will describe the making of one of the simpler types.\nTwo strips of wrought iron and two strips of 40 to 60 pt. steel are welded together in alternating layers into a bar. The bar is drawn out to length, then heated and twisted with an S twist [////////////], then hammered square again. A second identical bar is welded, drawn, then heated and given an equal Z twist [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] and hammered square. The two bars are welded to each other and a third strip of about 80 pt. steel is welded down the sides and across the tip for the cutting edge. The sword is then forged as above.\nTempering after quenching would possibly have been optional (depending on the carbon content of the steels) since the composite construction provides a hard edge and tough center. The blade is then polished and etched with a mild acid such as vinegar to bring out the V pattern of the welding down the center of the blade.\nThe pattern welded blade was difficult to make but its composite construction gave it great strength and keenness. The analogy is between breaking a 1\" pine board at a karate demonstration and trying to break a 1\" plywood plank. The cross elements strengthened the whole. It also enabled the smith to utilize a wider range of materials produced during smelting. Although the pattern welded sword was beautiful, decoration was never the primary reason for its construction. It was made that way because that was the best way to make it.\nIn the next part we will look at why this changed and also examine sword construction and materials in Islam.\nPART III\nEXPANDED PRODUCTION of STEEL\nWhen we last left the subject some 64 percent of the swords in the British Museum collection from the 5th through the 10th centuries were pattern welded. Starting in the 9th century, however, the proportion starts to fall and by the 11th century, except for the decorative technique of pattern welding symbols or letters into the blade, the classic pattern welded blade is losing out to the homogeneous steel blade.\nWhat happened?\nI suspect that there were two factors involved. The first is the cumulative experience in the making of natural steel by succeeding generations of smiths with their careful attention to the quality of the ore, the quantity of the charcoal, the intensity of the temperature and the length of the burn. With skill, and quality raw materials, steel could be smelted on a consistent basis.\nThe second factor may have been the introduction and spread of the Catalan forge from Spain, possibly as a result of pressure from the Muslim invasions of this period. Where earlier forges could produce only 50 pounds per charge the Catalan forge could produce 350 pounds. The design is efficient and simple enough to have persisted into the late 19th century in Spain and France as well as North Carolina and Tennessee.\nThis conjunction of superior technique and expanded production would have made good homogeneous steel available in economic quantities.\nTwo similar carburizing processes, case hardening and cementation, are also used to produce steel. Case hardening produced a very thin layer of steel on wrought iron (\"encasing it in steel,\" a possible derivation of the term) seldom more than 1/8\" thick, and frequently only several one hundredths of an inch. The carbon content would vary with the depth of penetration. Carbonized bone (later, in the 19th and 20th centuries, potassium cyanide!) was packed around the iron object and sealed in an airtight case (an alternate derivation of the term). The assembly was then cooked at a red heat for several hours according to the amount of penetration desired. I don't have a firm date for the origin of this process. However, the 19th century \"sword scandals\" (which gave Wilkinson Sword. its start) pointed out the problem with this process for swords. The British military purchased case hardened blades from Solingen, Germany, for its sabers. When the English craftsmen would fit them for their regimental hilt some of the case hardening was ground away, and when a trooper applied said sword to a mail-clad dervish in Egypt he would be surprised by the spectacle of his worthy blade folding up instead of cutting in. Bad show!\nCarburization on a grander scale (known as cementation) produces blister steel, a great stand-by in the 18th and 19th centuries. When it was further refined it was known as \"shear\" steel and employed for the cutting edges of scissors, knives and axes. The iron is packed in an airtight coffer and cooked at high temperature for days. When removed it presents the blistered appearance that gives it its popular name. Unfortunately, the only date I have seen, so far, for its origin is 1600 but it may well have had a much earlier origin.\nIn a third proposed method of carburization, the iron is supposed to pick up enough carbon to become steel by being \"soaked\" in the charcoal fire between being repeatedly worked on the anvil. I have found no analytical evidence that this works. In fact, you have to be careful about decarburizing good steel while forging it. You can heat and pound wrought iron all you want and it's still wrought iron. I suspect that, given the context that this was connected with, this is just scholarly speculation rather than a practical method of steel production.\n\"DAMASCUS\" STEEL\nThe term \"Damascus\" is so misused that I will avoid it in the balance of the article. Today it refers to any sword, letter opener or shotgun barrel with a pattern in the steel. It is also sometimes called \"watered\" steel because the pattern resembled that of watered silk. (Another example of Loom-to-Boom technology!) To avoid further confusion we will use the term wootz steel (from a misprint of \"wook\", from the Canarese \"(w)ukku\" meaning, of course, \"steel\") of which there may have been two varieties: crucible and (highly speculative) infusion, or perhaps \"co-fusion.\"\nIt is now more certain that the crucible variety of wootz steel was manufactured in India since Roman times. Wrought iron was broken into small lumps and placed in a series of small ceramic crucibles along with pieces of wood and leaves. Each crucible was sealed airtight and a number of them were packed into a furnace and heated for nearly a week in a blast of flame. Upon cooling the crucibles were broken open to reveal the re-solidified cakes of steel with the carbon absorbed from the plant material. Now, where did the pattern come from? At room temperature iron and steel exist in several varying forms which are given such delightsome names as ferrite, pearlyte, martensite and cementite. Ferrite crystals are essentially pure iron; pearlyte contains enough carbon to be effected by heat treatment, after which it becomes martensite; and cementite crystals are at the saturation point for carbon, akin to cast iron in hardness and brittleness. What you get in crucible wootz steel is a mixed aggregation of these crystals, each with its own appearance and properties.\nBecause of its unique consistency the cake of steel reportedly had to be first split radially and drawn out as if spreading a tire to force its tread into a straight line. The billet then had to be worked in a fairly narrow heat range with a minimum of hammering. Working outside the range was reputed to cause the steel to crumble along the crystal interfaces into its constituent parts. When finally formed, the swords were heated and then reportedly quenched in a blast of cold air blowing through a gap in the wall. (How one orders up these cold winds to blow through the gap in a wall in Damascus, Syria, has never been explained to me. I have enough trouble just keeping my sails full.) The end result of the process was a sword of legendary sharpness and flexibility, and we all know the legends. As with any other handcrafted article some were more flexible or sharper than others, and if King Richard could slice iron bars and Saladin could slice scarves or pillows, they were each using the top end \"monarch grade\" examples of two different schools of sword making. Neither of them would be able to both slice a pillow and sever an iron bar with the same sword, and I doubt that anyone ever will. (Not more than once!)\nIn terms of decorative qualities, the patterns of crucible wootz steel could be modified and enhanced by filing through the striations and hammered flat producing such variations as \"Mohammed's Ladder\". Normal working and the innate pattern of the steel produced \"Ant Tracks\". On the whole the details were much subtler than in pattern welding.\nAcccording to what I would regard as speculative accounts, an infusion form of wootz steel was made possible by the conditions existing in China. The Chinese had an abundance of anthracite coal and built high tower smelters. (Remember the high tower smelters of Mao's \"Great Leap Forward,\" about 12 to 20 feet tall?) I suspect that, since anthracite was much harder to crush than charcoal, the charge wouldn't \"squash down,\" leaving plenty of air spaces and raising the heat far above that obtained in a European bloomery. Whatever the cause, the result was cast iron. Using the technology developed for bronze casting, the Chinese were turning out wonderful cast iron pots in 500 B.C., centuries before the Vikings were riveting hand hammered wrought iron sheets together.\nCast iron, with its high carbon content, shattered much too easily for use as an edged weapon (although-it made dandy maces) but the Chinese also used bloomeries to produce wrought iron. In the infusion process as practiced in China and possibly the Middle East, bars or plates of wrought iron were placed in a container with cast iron and heated to the cast iron's melting point. The carbon would migrate out of the cast iron, lowering its carbon content, and into the wrought iron, raising its carbon level. In theory, because of the silica inclusions in the wrought iron, and the different depths of carbon depletion and penetration, the steel would have a variegated pattern that would appear when the blade was polished and etched. Once again the quality of the materials, the heat of the fire and the skill of the smith would be critical factors in the superiority of the blade.\nInterestingly enough it was the pursuit of an equivalent to crucible wootz steel, still a superior product for cutting edges in the 18th century, that led Benjamin Huntsman to develop a European form of crucible steel in 1740, which he used to make fine quality clock springs. In this method blister steel was cut up and re-melted in small airtight crucibles placed in an extremely hot coke fire. This produced a quality steel of homogeneous consistency and the method was used for fine steels until the invention of the electric furnace method in the 20th century. You can still find fine tools made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries marked \"crucible steel.\"\nIn the early 19th century Michael Faraday's investigation into the qualities of wootz steel led to his studies and development of steel alloys. Another century or so would pass before the full nature of wootz steel was understood, by which time the trail had grown cold and confused. The untangling goes on and some excellent work has been done recently. Ironically, the state of metallurgy has advanced to such a level that this pursuit, after stimulating some 200 years of development, is now done mostly for reasons of historical and intellectual curiosity.\nPart IV\nLOOKING EASTWARD\nIn our last section we will look at how two divergent cultures, the Malay and the Japanese, created swords that balanced the requirements of toughness and sharpness, materials and methods, physical and cultural requirements and perceptions.\nFolks who write or talk about Oriental weaponry take an odd delight In terminology. This is to distinguish those of us \"in the know\" from the rest of the uncultured, Illiterate, linguistically incompetent rabble. One purportedly encyclopedic work of \"all the worlds weapons\" detailed the name and customary usage of the net bags in which samurai carried the head of a fallen opponent, but failed to list any entry under bowie knife or shillelagh. It is my firm intention not to drown anyone in jargon. Only the most important terms need their proper names, and we'll define the terms as we come to them. (i.e. one should know a swage from a fuller, and the Malay may call it a \"peksi\" but a tang is still a tang. Besides, if you want to know all the neat names, study the books.\nTHE KRIS\nKris range in size from large daggers to short swords, from about nine inches to two feet. They are widely divergent in details and widely dispersed over a large area of the southeast Pacific islands. They usually have double-edged thrusting blades, predominantly in a wavy pattern. These waves, called \"lok,\" are always made in an odd number. Blades can have no lok at all, following a straight, thin profile, or have 17 or more lok depending on style, local custom, and personal desire. At its base the blade flares out asymmetrically in the \"ganja\" which serves in the office of a cross guard. The tang is relatively thin and is encased by the handle, which is frequently of a pistol grip design. Of greatest Interest to us is the \"pamor\" or texture of the blade. This is valued by the owners and creators for its beauty and originality. As the blade is forged, various steels are laminated together. These may include meteoric nickel-iron, wrought iron, truck spring, file, or stainless steel. The result is a strong blade with markings or textures running from subtle hues of steel on a highly polished blade to a distinctly and purposely rough outer side layers. (These blades are known as \"5 sharps,\" referring to the point, 2 cutting edges and 2 abrasive sides.)\nThe smith or \"empu\" may use various techniques to enhance the spiritual value and potency of the weapon. A smith may work on it just one day a year, or only by the full moon (or new moon). One smith quenched a kris by drawing It through his armpit and, then plunging it in the slack tub; a female smith went him one better by first drawing her kris through the lips of her nether regions! (In light of recent literature about fire walking, anxiety-induced moisture may explain the mechanism of these acts. But the symbolic significance holds the center stage: this smith was willing to give it everything.)\nSuch a creation, and the acts- heroic or evil- committed with it, further enhanced its spiritual power. A friend's wife, while working in Indonesia, was allowed to examine the kris of the family she staved with. She was later informed that it held the soul of the family! A high honor indeed.\nIn actual structure the kris is a relatively straightforward (despite the lok) laminated blade, using the various qualities of the steel and iron incorporated therein. It is sharp, durable, and deadly; and reflects the pride, skill, and wealth of its makers and bearers.\nJAPAN\nThe Japanese sword may be considered a complex laminated blade. It too has its own mystique, but it is more one of technical perfection and skillful use as much as of symbols and ritual. The technique varied from province to province and from age to age based upon the quality of the raw materials available and the skills and traditions of the smiths. Many smiths of the past (and probably some today) wasted a lot of time trying to reproduce effects that were accidents of the local ore and the smelting process. Other techniques were developed to compensate for the poorer qualities of certain ore or the new-smelted steel.\nThe steels for the sword are selected from the mixed bloom of the Japanese smelter. The smelter consumes about 13 tons of charcoal and 8 tons of fine ore in a closely supervised 72-hour run. The resulting two-ton bloom is knocked into fist-sized pieces with sledgehammers and sorted by eye according to carbon content. About half the bloom is 60- to 150-point steel. The best is dense and heavy with a bright, silvery color and a finer crystalline structure. The lower grades tend toward grayish black with a coarse grain.\nBack at the forge, steel with too high a carbon content can be decarburized by laying it in front of the tuyere in an oxidizing blast. Low carbon steel can be carburized by being stacked above the tuyere and enclosed by a deep pile of charcoal at the top of the forge; then slowly and deliberately cooked in a reducing fire. (Please note that this is different than \"just working the carbon in\" as proposed by some writers.)\nThe end result is one pile of steel suitable for the jacket or the edge, and another pile suitable for the core. The blades themselves can consist of as many as five sections (edge, sides, back and core) or as few as two (edge/jacket and core). For the sake of clarity and relative simplicity, we will deal with 2.\nFor the jacket/edge steel, four to seven pounds of square wafers of 100- to 150-point steel are stacked on a spatula-shaped piece, wrapped in rice paper, dipped in a clay slurry, thoroughly coated in rice straw ashes, (all this to prevent oxidation) and faggot welded into a single solid billet. The billet is drawn out, cut partway through, folded over (endwise or lengthwise, depending on the step), covered in clay and ashes and faggot welded again. This process proceeds for 14 or so folds, at a heat between a bright yellow and (no cooler than) a bright red.\nTwo very important things are happening here:\nFirst, the billet is losing both mass and carbon content, so that eventually the smith ends up with a billet weighing two to three and a half pounds with a carbon content of around 70 points.\nSecond, and most importantly, the smith is creating a billet of consistent, homogeneous steel. The metal is drawn out and folded much as bread dough is kneaded, to spread the various elements uniformly throughout the whole. If pattern welding may be likened to plywood, then this process may be closer to mixing concrete.\nTo make the core steel, the smith starts with two pounds of 50-point steel and draws, folds and welds it into a bar of 20- to 30-point steel weighing, perhaps, one half pound.\nThe jacket/edge steel is wrapped around the core steel and welded into a single billet. This is then carefully drawn out and shaped into a sword blank, which is then further refined Into a blade through skillful hammer work, working from a yellow heat to a cherry red each time. Too hot (a bright yellow), and the sword blank would be too plastic to control. Too cool, and the steel could crack under the hammer.\nThe sword is worked into shape in six-inch sections, and the cutting edge is left about one- tenth of an inch thick to prevent stress-cracking during the hardening process.\nAfter forging is completed, the blade is smoothed with a hardened steel drawknife and a series of files.\nThe blade is left rough and clean, and is not touched by bare hands to prevent any contact with oils. This is critical for the clay coating, which will create the \"hamon\" during the hardening process. Sometimes miscalled, a \"temper line\", the hamon is more truly a hardening line, and reflects the transition from the hard martensite structure in the fast cooling part of the blade to the softer, tougher pearlite of the slower cooling part of the blade. The crystalline pattern forms a definite boundary.\nNow considered part of the artistic aesthetics of the blade, originally it was a visible indicator of a proper hardening. Those swords with a wavy hamon also had the virtue of limiting the damage to those edges that had been chipped in battle, so that the sword could be resharpened without too much metal lost.\nThe hardening process (\"yaki-ire\") begins with mixing a coating of clay, charcoal, and pulverized sandstone. Several coats, a thin one over the cutting edge, and thicker ones over the back and to define the hamon, are applied to the blade. After drying, the blade is heated to its critical temperature. This operation usually takes place at night, with only the forge fire for illumination, since the incandescent color, and hence the temperature, is so important. The blade is passed back and forth through the charcoal fire until it is well over 700 degrees C. (1,292 degrees F.), between a bright red and an orange on the edge, and red to bright red on the back. (As a memory and teaching device the colors can be described poetically: \"autumn sunset\" is one phrase I recall.)\nThe blade is then reheated to 160 degrees C. (320 degrees F., in the pale to bright yellow oxidized color-tempering range), and quenched again, drawing the temper to a reasonable balance of toughness and hardness.\nDiluted acid is applied to reveal the hamon and confirm the success of the operation.\nAt this point the blade may be warped. Straightening is performed by localized reheating and hammering, using a red-hot copper block as an anvil. If this is not successful, then the swordsmith can reheat the sword and start the hardening process all over again. A good blade will survive three to five such attempts. Modern Japanese swordsmiths, with their emphasis on perfection, reject one half to one third of all their blades as failures.\nAfter rough polishing, defining the planes and shape of the blade, the smith will cut fullers, and possibly engravings, with a variety of drawknives and chisels.\nThe true secret of the beauty of the Japanese sword is revealed by polishing. This process can take from 10 days to two weeks for a single blade. Foundation polishing defines the planes of the blade and goes through six steps from about 180 grit to 3,000 grit or finer. With each level of fineness, the direction of the stroke is changed to reveal the removal of the striations from the previous grit. As in forging, the blade is done in 6-inch sections.\nAs mentioned above, the smith may grind the sword initially, through the first three steps, down to the 400-600 grit level. For the final polishing the sword-polisher switches from stationary water stones to a series of wafer-thin natural stones, glued to paper backings, followed by powdered iron oxide scale, suspended in vegetable oil, triple filtered through rice paper. The back, fullers, and sides of the blade are then burnished to a mirror finish with a series of heavy steel needles and burnishers. This incredible polishing sequence brings out every crystalline feature of the steel in the blade. It will also reveal any flaw!\nIn the current period perfection is paramount. In the feudal period the emphasis was on performance, and swords were sometimes tested by dispatching one, two, three, or, in an exceptional case, five condemned prisoners at a single stroke. The swords were meant for use, and the polishers and smiths were kept busy grinding out nicks and replacing shattered blades.\nThe most amazing thing about the Eastern swordsmiths is the results achieved with the simplicity of the equipment. In the West the old techniques were lost; superseded by advances in technology, equipment, materials and fashion. In the East these techniques are still living traditions and livelihoods. Hand powered bellows, a simple forge, block anvil, hammers, tongs, assorted chunks of steel, clay, rice ashes, polishing stones, charcoal... All of these would have been familiar or comprehensible to the Western swordsmith. The ingredients and equipment are simple. The patience and skill are complex. As Jan Derry told me in a different context, you can't buy skill; you have to develop it yourself, over time. When you realize this, you can better appreciate the creations of the swordsmiths, both ancient and modern.\nAfter Words, A.D. 2001\nI started this researching this series over 10 years ago and it took me about 4 years of somewhat dilatory effort to put the original papers together in comprehensive form. I have learned a lot since then, (some of which I have incorporated in this version) and I intend to learn more. If nothing else, you have learned a simple equation: no steel = no sword. (At least, no better than bronze.) Through much of history steel was as much a luxury as a necessity, and arcane methods were devised to create it and control it. A trade secret is money in the holder's pocket. Today, chunks of good steel litter the highways, good books abound (even if they contradict each other on certain points), and modern craftsmen have succeeded in reproducing all the \"lost arts' and processes that have been discussed in the four papers consolidated and presented here. Some of these craftsmen and artists charge thousands of dollars for their skills, knowledge, and effort; and some are third-world craftsmen eking out a living while feeding commercial Molochs plying the fantasy markets of America with misinformation. Oh well; we'll handle that another day.\nAs I stated before, read the works for yourself. A visit to your local library, and the resources available through the interlibrary loan system and the internet, are astonishing. Who knows what you may discover through research and observation.\nAs we started, so we end:\n'A little learning is a dang'rous thing;\nDrink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.\nThere shallow droughts intoxicate the brain,\nAnd drinking largely sobers us again.\"\nAlexander Pope, Essay on Criticism, Part II, line 15, 1711\n\u00a9 2001 Bruce Edward Blackistone.

The spear, axe and knife can all stab, hack and slice (sometimes with more efficiency, and certainly at less trouble and expense) but the sword has been seen throughout history as a weapon of nobility and magic. It is suitable for swearing oaths on or by. It has been a valued heirloom and a symbol of power to many people in many times and places.\nThe Roman legionnaire probably regarded his sword more as a useful tool than as a mystical symbol. Beyond the care and respect that almost any soldier feels for a reliable and efficient piece of equipment upon which his life depended (and one that stayed at hand, unlike the pilum), the Roman would hew barbarians or brushwood with equal facility. His sword was issued to him. It was usually not an heirloom passed down through the family, nor an award for heroic service, nor was it purchased at great price and embellished with gold. It was just, well... a sword.\nAt the other extreme, the Javanese kris has far more power as a magical talisman, cultural badge and work of art than it has as a weapon. Kris are reputed to leap into the hand when the owner is attacked; to rattle in the scabbard when danger approaches; to sigh in disappointment when sheathed. Many are said to be able to direct flames and help put out house fires, while some are so potent that merely stabbing an enemies foot print will ensure his demise. Meteoric iron is used in some kris not so much for its superior quality or contrasting beauty (although these are valid virtues) but because of its magical associations.\nFor the Japanese the sword was venerated for its symbolic and mystical qualities and some of the finer ones were enshrined in Shinto temples. Today the Japanese sword is seen as a triumph of art and craftsmanship, but during turbulent times the sword smiths could also hammer them out in quantity. One smithy increased its rate of production from one every two weeks to ten a day!\nIn Islam the sword was also highly honored and justly famed for its keenness of edge and strength, the result of the superior steel employed in its forging. (The earliest Islamic swords were very similar to the European broad sword, the familiar scimitar being adapted from Turkic and other steppe tribes.) Damascus became the most famed center of the craft, so that to this day any steel showing a pattern similar to the eutectic steel employed in Islamic swords is called \"damascus\".\nThe northern European broad sword of pattern welded or homogenous construction inhabited the middle ground between the mystic and the utilitarian. Everybody knew stories about wondrous blades forged by god/smiths or giants or dwarves, but very few seemed to know anyone who had them. They would be given names like \"Limb Biter\" or \"Wolf Tooth\" or \"Pierce\" but this was probably more a case of affection for an animistic companion than for any noumenous power that might be invoked. Old swords were valued not the least because only good swords got to be old swords. As Odin says in the Hovamal:\n\"Praise no day 'til evening;\nno wife 'til on her pyre;\nno sword 'til tested;\nno ice 'til crossed;\nno ale 'til drunk.\"\nI can personally attest that there is nothing so embarrassing as standing on the battlefield holding an empty hilt while the blade lies flopped on the grass behind you.\nSECRETS\nAs I started to research this paper I came across a literary gap in the sources (at least as far as European swords are concerned). From Pliny the Elder (+AD79) until the 17th century the sources are remarkably tight lipped. The reason for this is that knowledge of smelting, forging and tempering techniques were important trade secrets to be kept within the confines of the family, guild or town. The market for a superior product could only be controlled if the resources and techniques were closely held. Others may stumble upon superior methods and products through empirical experimentation, but that was no reason to give it away. For a modern parallel observe the despairing reaction of any Marklandic blacksmith upon learning that another has taken up the hammer. The knowledge is available in the library, good steel litters the landscape as scrap, and the competition for a somewhat limited market is fierce.\nTHE PROPERTIES OF THE SWORD\nThe sword was a high technology weapon in its day. A spear could stab and if the point bent a bit on a bone you could work around it. An axe might be a bit heavy, but it was sturdy and powerful and one well directed blow could put an end to the most intractable dispute. The mace and, its variations, relied on brute, crushing force. None of these weapons required the amount and quality of valuable metal that the sword did. The physical requirements of the sword were special. It had to be long yet strong, hard and sharp yet tough, flexible yet sturdy. Think of it as a cold chisel with a cutting edge 30 inches long. As opposed to the swords used in recreation and thespian battles today, the edges were well sharpened, the better to cleave metal, leather and cloth armor. One of the Norse sagas recounts a king who had several mysterious, heavy chests hauled aboard before sailing off to a sea battle. At the crux of the battle, when he observed his men wearying and the swords not biting-in, he opened the chests to reveal newly sharpened swords, which were rapidly issued to the seamen. (Cutting steel with a dull chisel is no fun, and if you were to use a sword as an impact weapon a mace would do better. Interesting enough, against unarmored opponents, a sword could be too sharp. During the Indian Wars the U. S. Cavalry troops were ordered not to sharpen their sabers since the sharp ones tended to cleave into and get stuck in the bone.)\nTo stay sharp a sword had to be hard, but the harder it is the more brittle it tends to be.\nLet's step back here and deal with the materials at this point.\nWROUGHT IRON: .00% to .04% (4 pts.) carbon, 3% silica.\nCharacteristics: soft, malleable, welds easily, resists burning in the forge, resists rust, when bent tends to stay bent.\nSTEEL: .04% (4 pts.) to 2.25% (225 pts.) carbon. Most modern steel runs from 20 point \"mild steel\" to 150 point \"tool steel\". Steel has a low silica content and usually various trace metals. In the period we are dealing with these trace metals were accidental. In the modern period they are intentional, creating various alloys for different purposes. Intentional or accidental, they will affect the performance of the steel, and ores containing different elements were used for different tools or weapons. Trial and error works even when you don't know why something works.\nCharacteristics: harder, less malleable, difficult to weld, easy to burn in the forge, rusts, tends towards springiness, shatters when over-hardened, cracks when worked at wrong temperature - all in proportion to its carbon content.\nCAST IRON: Up to 8% impurities including 3.5% to 4.25% carbon, plus phosphorus, silica etc.\nCharacteristics: hard, brittle, non-malleable, casts in liquid form, heat resistant, withstands compression, rusts, doesn't weld at all. Cast iron is produced (in useable quantities) by high heat blast furnaces.\nSo here is the basic problem: wrought iron, available in classical and early medieval Europe, makes dandy door hinges but lousy swords. It won't hold an edge, it bends and deforms; it's actually worse than bronze. Cast iron, available in Asia because of the design of their smelting furnaces and the use of coal, won't work very well either. It is much too brittle. Only steel achieves the required balance of qualities, but there is no easy and sure way to smelt it in quantity. Further, it requires special techniques to create a reliable weapon in the high-stress environment that a sword must operate in,\nIn the next sections I will go in depth into how separate societies with similar levels of technology solved this problem to create swords for defense, for beauty and for respect, honor or veneration.\nPART II\nMethods of Construction\nThere are seven methods of construction that we will deal with in the next several parts of this paper, so I will take this opportunity to list them and then explain them at length while describing their manufacture and the characteristics of the processes. They are: natural alloy iron, simple laminated welding, pattern welding, homogeneous tempered steel, crucible wootz steel, infused wootz steel, and complex laminated welding.\nRoman Swords\nEarly blades of almost pure iron could be work-hardened to some extent, just as bronze was. The constant and skillful pounding of the smith's hammer tended to compact the mass, but overdoing this could lead to brittleness. These swords were no better than, and frequently inferior to, bronze. But iron ores were relatively plentiful as opposed to copper and tin, which were both more rare and widely dispersed. Interruption of trade for any reason would prevent the accumulation of either or both copper and tin and immediately halt further manufacture of bronze. Iron ore was not only more plentiful than those metals, but the other needed ingredient to smelt it -charcoal- stood in rich supply in the forests that blanketed Europe.\nStill, work-hardened iron was hardly the ideal material for weapons. But the advantage of having an empire is that you have a wide range of both human talent and material resources. We, unfortunately, know little of the talent involved in the making of their swords, but the end result indicates that it was more than competent. In terms of resources the main secret of the Roman sword was the quality of the ore from which the metal was smelted. These natural alloys were employed in tools, weapons or hardware according to their various virtues. The occurrence of manganese, nickel and tungsten in these ores benefited the hardness and toughness of the finished metal with manganese especially adding to the ability to work harden the edge.\nInterestingly enough Pliny the Elder attributes these superior properties not to the quality of the ore or the skill of the regional craftsmen but to the qualities of the water that they were quenched in. This is either a classic case of disinformation to obscure the processes used from the competition or reflects the tenacious belief that the constitution of the quenching medium is of the utmost importance to the quality of the finished object.\n\"Magic\" waters, secret formulas, milk, butter, wax, gusts of cold air, blood, and even (legendarily) living slaves were used to quench swords in the pursuit of both physical and magical virtue. In truth, all that a quenching medium does is to control the rate of cooling and therefore the hardness and temper of a blade. Water, with a low boiling point, cools quickly; brine will cool slightly faster (a point still in contention in several modern books which insist that brine cools more slowly); and oil cools slower. The results of the cooling rate will be discussed further on, but suffice it to say that you can get pretty much the same quenching performance from a barrel of tepid brine as opposed to plunging a red hot blade into a living slave, and at far less pain, expense and spiritual peril. It has also been noticed that the poor slave would tend to writhe a bit, which might put a bit of twist in the blade.\nBeyond regional ores the Romans would also import wootz steel from India via the Levant. Of course, in keeping with the normal level of subterfuge, the Romans were led to believe that these small (2 to 5 lbs.) ingots originated in China along with the silk they so eagerly sought. These ingots were apparently devoted exclusively to swords, daggers, shears or other cutting implements and were considered both high class and high priced.\nFrom at least the first century the Romans also employed laminated and complex pattern welding in some of their swords, a technique apparently devised by the Celts at about, or shortly before, this time.\nTHE NORTHERN EUROPEANS\nIn the north as in Rome the primary source of iron and steel was the bloomery furnace: a fairly simple device that relied on natural draft, prevailing winds or minimal bellows to supply the air to raise the temperature of the fire enough to reduce the oar to a mass of metal and slag, but not so much as to oxidize or melt the mass. In its early form it was a wide, low chimney with an opening at the bottom for feeding in air and manipulating the bloom. It was filled from the top with semi-mixed layers of ore and charcoal (and eventually limestone or some other appropriate flux to carry off or absorb impurities). The ore could consist of some high quality natural alloy with a nice proportion of manganese to strengthen it and remove impurities such as sulfur, phosphorus, and arsenic; or it could be plain old (and ever popular) bog iron (limonite). Bog iron is formed by bacterial action precipitating it from solution in the water. If the bog remains undisturbed the limonite will replenish itself in about twenty years. (If the local well water tasted heavily of iron, then the ore was probably pretty good; but if it tasted of sulfur, that might not be a good sign.) Limonite also occurs in \"fossil\" form, where a bog may once have existed.\nNow, if you carefully controlled your proportions and air flow and heat, the carbon in the charcoal would cause the iron to start to aggregate as the oxygen of the iron oxide was consumed in the reducing conditions of the fire and changed to carbon monoxide. Some impurities would burn away and others would melt as slag (taking a lot of iron with it). Eventually you would get a large, red hot, lumpish mass consisting mostly of iron with some silica. You would either drag this out of the front of the furnace or dismantle the furnace to get at it, depending upon the design. You would then take this \"bloom\", weighing from 5 to 50 pounds, lay it on a large flat rock or anvil and have three large friends with sledge hammers beat the ever-living aspirations and most of the silica and remaining impurities out of it until you were left with a large bar shaped piece of wrought iron; good for door hinges but not so great for swords.\nHowever, if you got careless or curious or distracted and put in too much charcoal, and you pumped the bellows too hard or the wind came up unexpectedly, and you kept feeding it and let it run longer than usual a funny thing would start to happen. At about 2400 degrees F the iron would start to absorb the carbon. Now when the bloom was removed from the furnace, those portions that hadn't absorbed the carbon would work like wrought iron. Those portions that had absorbed too much carbon would turn into cast iron, either to melt away in the slag or to shatter as the cooling mass was hammered into a billet.\nThe metal between these two extremes was steel (or \"hard iron\" in the classical period). It looked different and worked different since the higher the carbon content the more \"stiffly\" it worked. Steel could be hardened and tempered, and it didn't take that much carbon to give a good cutting edge. Several cutting implements such as axes and chisels from the Mastermyr find were analyzed and the cutting edges were found to be only 40 pt. steel. This is low by modern standards but if you were to graph out the maximum quenched hardness of steel against the carbon content, you would notice a peculiar phenomenon: 10 pt. steel has a hardness on the Rockwell \"C\" scale of about 38; at 20 pts. the hardness is about 50, at 30 pts. it's about 58, and at 40 pts. the maximum hardness is about 61. From 40 pts. to 100 pts. the steel only gains about 7 more Rockwell \"C\" scale points in maximum hardness as the curve levels out.\nIn terms of an axe with a 40 pt. cutting edge laid into it, this would mean that you may have to sharpen it more often, but it would still have the hardness of the steel and the durability and toughness of the wrought iron. You might not even have to temper it at this range.\nThere are now two courses that you could take to make the sword. One is to accumulate enough of the right grade of steel to create a uniform, homogenous billet out of which to forge the blade. The other is to try to take several grades of steel and wrought iron and forge them into a sword so as to take advantage of their diverse properties.\nBoth types of swords were used throughout the early medieval period. Of some 142 swords from the 5th through the 10th centuries, discovered in England and X-rayed by the British Museum, some 64% were patterned welded. A partial breakdown showed that pattern welded blades made up 44% of the finds in the 5th through 6th centuries, 77% in the 6th century, 100% in the 7th century, and was back down to 45% in the 9th through 10th centuries.\n(from: Swords of the Anglo Saxon and Viking Periods in the British Museum: A Radiographic Study)\nHOMOGENEOUS STEEL SWORDS\nWe will deal with the homogenous steel sword first. Starting with an appropriate size steel billet of suitable carbon content (Probably about 60 pts. Too little carbon would lack the springiness as well as the hardness required; too much would be too brittle.) the metal is heated and the blade and tang are drawn out by hammering to sword-like proportions. A groove was frequently fullered down the midsection of the blade to both strengthen and lighten the blade in relation to its width. (This fuller is sometimes called a \"blood gutter\" today, but that's probably a bit of Victorian Romanticism. It's basically the same principle that tin roofs and corrugated cardboard rely upon for stiffness.) The sword is then brought to a smoother finish and the hammer marks removed by filing and/or the use of a grindstone. When all is ready except the final sharpening the blade is hardened and tempered.\nThere are two methods of doing this: In the first the blade is heated to a cherry red and then plunged into a cooling medium, let's say brine. Assuming that the thermal shock is not too violent (which would either shatter the blade or leave stress cracks) the blade is now at maximum hardness, but also at maximum brittleness. This is where tempering comes in. The sword is carefully re-heated to reduce the internal stress and brittleness while retaining a sufficient degree of hardness.\nTempering, of itself, is proof of a benevolent Deity: for as the metal is heated the surface is oxidized and reflects different colors at different temperatures. Starting with pale yellow at 420 degrees it goes to straw (470), bronze (500), purple (540), dark blue (590), and steel gray (650). When you get to gray the temper is completely drawn and you have undone your hardening.\nDepending upon how much carbon is in the metal and the use to which it is to be put, you chose the appropriate color to heat to. The result of drawing to a bronze in 100 pt. steel would be quite different than in 40 pt. steel. In the case of the sword of 60 pts.: a good blue will probably do the job.\nThe other method is to vary the speed of the quenching. This may have been done by coating the center portion of the blade with clay or some other insulating material. When the blade is quenched the clay slows down the coolin4 of the center portion leaving the sword with hard edges but a softer, tougher center. Whether medieval European swordsmiths ever used this technique will remain speculative until comprehensive examination of the blades take place. There is no reason why it wouldn't work, (as it still does for the Japanese and several modern swordsmiths) and it may well have been one of those \"trade secret\" techniques.\nThere are several potential problems with making and using a homogenous blade of uncertain steel: It may be hard to come by enough of the proper steel. Any oversized silica or slag inclusion would weaken the blade, leading to breakage. Because of the uniformity of the metal repeated blows in use could (in theory) work harden portions of it, leading to brittleness or breakage\nfrom metal fatigue. Finally, it's not as \"fancy\" looking as a pattern welded blade.\nPATTERN WELDED SWORDS\nThe pattern welded blade is formed of strips and bars of varying carbon content, twisted and welded into a unified whole. The problem with pattern welding is that welding is a very touchy operation. Wrought iron enters the semi-liquid welding stage at about 2,500 degrees and starts to burn at about 2,750 degrees while the range for 100 pt. steel is between about 2,200 and 2,600 degrees. This leaves a very narrow range in which to weld one to the other; and over a forge fire only the critical eye of the smith could judge the right time to strike. Once the carbon in the steel started to burn it was all over and the piece could well be ruined. Skill and experience are the key factors.\nThere were at least a good dozen patterns used, and the permutations are endless, so I will describe the making of one of the simpler types.\nTwo strips of wrought iron and two strips of 40 to 60 pt. steel are welded together in alternating layers into a bar. The bar is drawn out to length, then heated and twisted with an S twist [////////////], then hammered square again. A second identical bar is welded, drawn, then heated and given an equal Z twist [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] and hammered square. The two bars are welded to each other and a third strip of about 80 pt. steel is welded down the sides and across the tip for the cutting edge. The sword is then forged as above.\nTempering after quenching would possibly have been optional (depending on the carbon content of the steels) since the composite construction provides a hard edge and tough center. The blade is then polished and etched with a mild acid such as vinegar to bring out the V pattern of the welding down the center of the blade.\nThe pattern welded blade was difficult to make but its composite construction gave it great strength and keenness. The analogy is between breaking a 1\" pine board at a karate demonstration and trying to break a 1\" plywood plank. The cross elements strengthened the whole. It also enabled the smith to utilize a wider range of materials produced during smelting. Although the pattern welded sword was beautiful, decoration was never the primary reason for its construction. It was made that way because that was the best way to make it.\nIn the next part we will look at why this changed and also examine sword construction and materials in Islam.\nPART III\nEXPANDED PRODUCTION of STEEL\nWhen we last left the subject some 64 percent of the swords in the British Museum collection from the 5th through the 10th centuries were pattern welded. Starting in the 9th century, however, the proportion starts to fall and by the 11th century, except for the decorative technique of pattern welding symbols or letters into the blade, the classic pattern welded blade is losing out to the homogeneous steel blade.\nWhat happened?\nI suspect that there were two factors involved. The first is the cumulative experience in the making of natural steel by succeeding generations of smiths with their careful attention to the quality of the ore, the quantity of the charcoal, the intensity of the temperature and the length of the burn. With skill, and quality raw materials, steel could be smelted on a consistent basis.\nThe second factor may have been the introduction and spread of the Catalan forge from Spain, possibly as a result of pressure from the Muslim invasions of this period. Where earlier forges could produce only 50 pounds per charge the Catalan forge could produce 350 pounds. The design is efficient and simple enough to have persisted into the late 19th century in Spain and France as well as North Carolina and Tennessee.\nThis conjunction of superior technique and expanded production would have made good homogeneous steel available in economic quantities.\nTwo similar carburizing processes, case hardening and cementation, are also used to produce steel. Case hardening produced a very thin layer of steel on wrought iron (\"encasing it in steel,\" a possible derivation of the term) seldom more than 1/8\" thick, and frequently only several one hundredths of an inch. The carbon content would vary with the depth of penetration. Carbonized bone (later, in the 19th and 20th centuries, potassium cyanide!) was packed around the iron object and sealed in an airtight case (an alternate derivation of the term). The assembly was then cooked at a red heat for several hours according to the amount of penetration desired. I don't have a firm date for the origin of this process. However, the 19th century \"sword scandals\" (which gave Wilkinson Sword. its start) pointed out the problem with this process for swords. The British military purchased case hardened blades from Solingen, Germany, for its sabers. When the English craftsmen would fit them for their regimental hilt some of the case hardening was ground away, and when a trooper applied said sword to a mail-clad dervish in Egypt he would be surprised by the spectacle of his worthy blade folding up instead of cutting in. Bad show!\nCarburization on a grander scale (known as cementation) produces blister steel, a great stand-by in the 18th and 19th centuries. When it was further refined it was known as \"shear\" steel and employed for the cutting edges of scissors, knives and axes. The iron is packed in an airtight coffer and cooked at high temperature for days. When removed it presents the blistered appearance that gives it its popular name. Unfortunately, the only date I have seen, so far, for its origin is 1600 but it may well have had a much earlier origin.\nIn a third proposed method of carburization, the iron is supposed to pick up enough carbon to become steel by being \"soaked\" in the charcoal fire between being repeatedly worked on the anvil. I have found no analytical evidence that this works. In fact, you have to be careful about decarburizing good steel while forging it. You can heat and pound wrought iron all you want and it's still wrought iron. I suspect that, given the context that this was connected with, this is just scholarly speculation rather than a practical method of steel production.\n\"DAMASCUS\" STEEL\nThe term \"Damascus\" is so misused that I will avoid it in the balance of the article. Today it refers to any sword, letter opener or shotgun barrel with a pattern in the steel. It is also sometimes called \"watered\" steel because the pattern resembled that of watered silk. (Another example of Loom-to-Boom technology!) To avoid further confusion we will use the term wootz steel (from a misprint of \"wook\", from the Canarese \"(w)ukku\" meaning, of course, \"steel\") of which there may have been two varieties: crucible and (highly speculative) infusion, or perhaps \"co-fusion.\"\nIt is now more certain that the crucible variety of wootz steel was manufactured in India since Roman times. Wrought iron was broken into small lumps and placed in a series of small ceramic crucibles along with pieces of wood and leaves. Each crucible was sealed airtight and a number of them were packed into a furnace and heated for nearly a week in a blast of flame. Upon cooling the crucibles were broken open to reveal the re-solidified cakes of steel with the carbon absorbed from the plant material. Now, where did the pattern come from? At room temperature iron and steel exist in several varying forms which are given such delightsome names as ferrite, pearlyte, martensite and cementite. Ferrite crystals are essentially pure iron; pearlyte contains enough carbon to be effected by heat treatment, after which it becomes martensite; and cementite crystals are at the saturation point for carbon, akin to cast iron in hardness and brittleness. What you get in crucible wootz steel is a mixed aggregation of these crystals, each with its own appearance and properties.\nBecause of its unique consistency the cake of steel reportedly had to be first split radially and drawn out as if spreading a tire to force its tread into a straight line. The billet then had to be worked in a fairly narrow heat range with a minimum of hammering. Working outside the range was reputed to cause the steel to crumble along the crystal interfaces into its constituent parts. When finally formed, the swords were heated and then reportedly quenched in a blast of cold air blowing through a gap in the wall. (How one orders up these cold winds to blow through the gap in a wall in Damascus, Syria, has never been explained to me. I have enough trouble just keeping my sails full.) The end result of the process was a sword of legendary sharpness and flexibility, and we all know the legends. As with any other handcrafted article some were more flexible or sharper than others, and if King Richard could slice iron bars and Saladin could slice scarves or pillows, they were each using the top end \"monarch grade\" examples of two different schools of sword making. Neither of them would be able to both slice a pillow and sever an iron bar with the same sword, and I doubt that anyone ever will. (Not more than once!)\nIn terms of decorative qualities, the patterns of crucible wootz steel could be modified and enhanced by filing through the striations and hammered flat producing such variations as \"Mohammed's Ladder\". Normal working and the innate pattern of the steel produced \"Ant Tracks\". On the whole the details were much subtler than in pattern welding.\nAcccording to what I would regard as speculative accounts, an infusion form of wootz steel was made possible by the conditions existing in China. The Chinese had an abundance of anthracite coal and built high tower smelters. (Remember the high tower smelters of Mao's \"Great Leap Forward,\" about 12 to 20 feet tall?) I suspect that, since anthracite was much harder to crush than charcoal, the charge wouldn't \"squash down,\" leaving plenty of air spaces and raising the heat far above that obtained in a European bloomery. Whatever the cause, the result was cast iron. Using the technology developed for bronze casting, the Chinese were turning out wonderful cast iron pots in 500 B.C., centuries before the Vikings were riveting hand hammered wrought iron sheets together.\nCast iron, with its high carbon content, shattered much too easily for use as an edged weapon (although-it made dandy maces) but the Chinese also used bloomeries to produce wrought iron. In the infusion process as practiced in China and possibly the Middle East, bars or plates of wrought iron were placed in a container with cast iron and heated to the cast iron's melting point. The carbon would migrate out of the cast iron, lowering its carbon content, and into the wrought iron, raising its carbon level. In theory, because of the silica inclusions in the wrought iron, and the different depths of carbon depletion and penetration, the steel would have a variegated pattern that would appear when the blade was polished and etched. Once again the quality of the materials, the heat of the fire and the skill of the smith would be critical factors in the superiority of the blade.\nInterestingly enough it was the pursuit of an equivalent to crucible wootz steel, still a superior product for cutting edges in the 18th century, that led Benjamin Huntsman to develop a European form of crucible steel in 1740, which he used to make fine quality clock springs. In this method blister steel was cut up and re-melted in small airtight crucibles placed in an extremely hot coke fire. This produced a quality steel of homogeneous consistency and the method was used for fine steels until the invention of the electric furnace method in the 20th century. You can still find fine tools made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries marked \"crucible steel.\"\nIn the early 19th century Michael Faraday's investigation into the qualities of wootz steel led to his studies and development of steel alloys. Another century or so would pass before the full nature of wootz steel was understood, by which time the trail had grown cold and confused. The untangling goes on and some excellent work has been done recently. Ironically, the state of metallurgy has advanced to such a level that this pursuit, after stimulating some 200 years of development, is now done mostly for reasons of historical and intellectual curiosity.\nPart IV\nLOOKING EASTWARD\nIn our last section we will look at how two divergent cultures, the Malay and the Japanese, created swords that balanced the requirements of toughness and sharpness, materials and methods, physical and cultural requirements and perceptions.\nFolks who write or talk about Oriental weaponry take an odd delight In terminology. This is to distinguish those of us \"in the know\" from the rest of the uncultured, Illiterate, linguistically incompetent rabble. One purportedly encyclopedic work of \"all the worlds weapons\" detailed the name and customary usage of the net bags in which samurai carried the head of a fallen opponent, but failed to list any entry under bowie knife or shillelagh. It is my firm intention not to drown anyone in jargon. Only the most important terms need their proper names, and we'll define the terms as we come to them. (i.e. one should know a swage from a fuller, and the Malay may call it a \"peksi\" but a tang is still a tang. Besides, if you want to know all the neat names, study the books.\nTHE KRIS\nKris range in size from large daggers to short swords, from about nine inches to two feet. They are widely divergent in details and widely dispersed over a large area of the southeast Pacific islands. They usually have double-edged thrusting blades, predominantly in a wavy pattern. These waves, called \"lok,\" are always made in an odd number. Blades can have no lok at all, following a straight, thin profile, or have 17 or more lok depending on style, local custom, and personal desire. At its base the blade flares out asymmetrically in the \"ganja\" which serves in the office of a cross guard. The tang is relatively thin and is encased by the handle, which is frequently of a pistol grip design. Of greatest Interest to us is the \"pamor\" or texture of the blade. This is valued by the owners and creators for its beauty and originality. As the blade is forged, various steels are laminated together. These may include meteoric nickel-iron, wrought iron, truck spring, file, or stainless steel. The result is a strong blade with markings or textures running from subtle hues of steel on a highly polished blade to a distinctly and purposely rough outer side layers. (These blades are known as \"5 sharps,\" referring to the point, 2 cutting edges and 2 abrasive sides.)\nThe smith or \"empu\" may use various techniques to enhance the spiritual value and potency of the weapon. A smith may work on it just one day a year, or only by the full moon (or new moon). One smith quenched a kris by drawing It through his armpit and, then plunging it in the slack tub; a female smith went him one better by first drawing her kris through the lips of her nether regions! (In light of recent literature about fire walking, anxiety-induced moisture may explain the mechanism of these acts. But the symbolic significance holds the center stage: this smith was willing to give it everything.)\nSuch a creation, and the acts- heroic or evil- committed with it, further enhanced its spiritual power. A friend's wife, while working in Indonesia, was allowed to examine the kris of the family she staved with. She was later informed that it held the soul of the family! A high honor indeed.\nIn actual structure the kris is a relatively straightforward (despite the lok) laminated blade, using the various qualities of the steel and iron incorporated therein. It is sharp, durable, and deadly; and reflects the pride, skill, and wealth of its makers and bearers.\nJAPAN\nThe Japanese sword may be considered a complex laminated blade. It too has its own mystique, but it is more one of technical perfection and skillful use as much as of symbols and ritual. The technique varied from province to province and from age to age based upon the quality of the raw materials available and the skills and traditions of the smiths. Many smiths of the past (and probably some today) wasted a lot of time trying to reproduce effects that were accidents of the local ore and the smelting process. Other techniques were developed to compensate for the poorer qualities of certain ore or the new-smelted steel.\nThe steels for the sword are selected from the mixed bloom of the Japanese smelter. The smelter consumes about 13 tons of charcoal and 8 tons of fine ore in a closely supervised 72-hour run. The resulting two-ton bloom is knocked into fist-sized pieces with sledgehammers and sorted by eye according to carbon content. About half the bloom is 60- to 150-point steel. The best is dense and heavy with a bright, silvery color and a finer crystalline structure. The lower grades tend toward grayish black with a coarse grain.\nBack at the forge, steel with too high a carbon content can be decarburized by laying it in front of the tuyere in an oxidizing blast. Low carbon steel can be carburized by being stacked above the tuyere and enclosed by a deep pile of charcoal at the top of the forge; then slowly and deliberately cooked in a reducing fire. (Please note that this is different than \"just working the carbon in\" as proposed by some writers.)\nThe end result is one pile of steel suitable for the jacket or the edge, and another pile suitable for the core. The blades themselves can consist of as many as five sections (edge, sides, back and core) or as few as two (edge/jacket and core). For the sake of clarity and relative simplicity, we will deal with 2.\nFor the jacket/edge steel, four to seven pounds of square wafers of 100- to 150-point steel are stacked on a spatula-shaped piece, wrapped in rice paper, dipped in a clay slurry, thoroughly coated in rice straw ashes, (all this to prevent oxidation) and faggot welded into a single solid billet. The billet is drawn out, cut partway through, folded over (endwise or lengthwise, depending on the step), covered in clay and ashes and faggot welded again. This process proceeds for 14 or so folds, at a heat between a bright yellow and (no cooler than) a bright red.\nTwo very important things are happening here:\nFirst, the billet is losing both mass and carbon content, so that eventually the smith ends up with a billet weighing two to three and a half pounds with a carbon content of around 70 points.\nSecond, and most importantly, the smith is creating a billet of consistent, homogeneous steel. The metal is drawn out and folded much as bread dough is kneaded, to spread the various elements uniformly throughout the whole. If pattern welding may be likened to plywood, then this process may be closer to mixing concrete.\nTo make the core steel, the smith starts with two pounds of 50-point steel and draws, folds and welds it into a bar of 20- to 30-point steel weighing, perhaps, one half pound.\nThe jacket/edge steel is wrapped around the core steel and welded into a single billet. This is then carefully drawn out and shaped into a sword blank, which is then further refined Into a blade through skillful hammer work, working from a yellow heat to a cherry red each time. Too hot (a bright yellow), and the sword blank would be too plastic to control. Too cool, and the steel could crack under the hammer.\nThe sword is worked into shape in six-inch sections, and the cutting edge is left about one- tenth of an inch thick to prevent stress-cracking during the hardening process.\nAfter forging is completed, the blade is smoothed with a hardened steel drawknife and a series of files.\nThe blade is left rough and clean, and is not touched by bare hands to prevent any contact with oils. This is critical for the clay coating, which will create the \"hamon\" during the hardening process. Sometimes miscalled, a \"temper line\", the hamon is more truly a hardening line, and reflects the transition from the hard martensite structure in the fast cooling part of the blade to the softer, tougher pearlite of the slower cooling part of the blade. The crystalline pattern forms a definite boundary.\nNow considered part of the artistic aesthetics of the blade, originally it was a visible indicator of a proper hardening. Those swords with a wavy hamon also had the virtue of limiting the damage to those edges that had been chipped in battle, so that the sword could be resharpened without too much metal lost.\nThe hardening process (\"yaki-ire\") begins with mixing a coating of clay, charcoal, and pulverized sandstone. Several coats, a thin one over the cutting edge, and thicker ones over the back and to define the hamon, are applied to the blade. After drying, the blade is heated to its critical temperature. This operation usually takes place at night, with only the forge fire for illumination, since the incandescent color, and hence the temperature, is so important. The blade is passed back and forth through the charcoal fire until it is well over 700 degrees C. (1,292 degrees F.), between a bright red and an orange on the edge, and red to bright red on the back. (As a memory and teaching device the colors can be described poetically: \"autumn sunset\" is one phrase I recall.)\nThe blade is then reheated to 160 degrees C. (320 degrees F., in the pale to bright yellow oxidized color-tempering range), and quenched again, drawing the temper to a reasonable balance of toughness and hardness.\nDiluted acid is applied to reveal the hamon and confirm the success of the operation.\nAt this point the blade may be warped. Straightening is performed by localized reheating and hammering, using a red-hot copper block as an anvil. If this is not successful, then the swordsmith can reheat the sword and start the hardening process all over again. A good blade will survive three to five such attempts. Modern Japanese swordsmiths, with their emphasis on perfection, reject one half to one third of all their blades as failures.\nAfter rough polishing, defining the planes and shape of the blade, the smith will cut fullers, and possibly engravings, with a variety of drawknives and chisels.\nThe true secret of the beauty of the Japanese sword is revealed by polishing. This process can take from 10 days to two weeks for a single blade. Foundation polishing defines the planes of the blade and goes through six steps from about 180 grit to 3,000 grit or finer. With each level of fineness, the direction of the stroke is changed to reveal the removal of the striations from the previous grit. As in forging, the blade is done in 6-inch sections.\nAs mentioned above, the smith may grind the sword initially, through the first three steps, down to the 400-600 grit level. For the final polishing the sword-polisher switches from stationary water stones to a series of wafer-thin natural stones, glued to paper backings, followed by powdered iron oxide scale, suspended in vegetable oil, triple filtered through rice paper. The back, fullers, and sides of the blade are then burnished to a mirror finish with a series of heavy steel needles and burnishers. This incredible polishing sequence brings out every crystalline feature of the steel in the blade. It will also reveal any flaw!\nIn the current period perfection is paramount. In the feudal period the emphasis was on performance, and swords were sometimes tested by dispatching one, two, three, or, in an exceptional case, five condemned prisoners at a single stroke. The swords were meant for use, and the polishers and smiths were kept busy grinding out nicks and replacing shattered blades.\nThe most amazing thing about the Eastern swordsmiths is the results achieved with the simplicity of the equipment. In the West the old techniques were lost; superseded by advances in technology, equipment, materials and fashion. In the East these techniques are still living traditions and livelihoods. Hand powered bellows, a simple forge, block anvil, hammers, tongs, assorted chunks of steel, clay, rice ashes, polishing stones, charcoal... All of these would have been familiar or comprehensible to the Western swordsmith. The ingredients and equipment are simple. The patience and skill are complex. As Jan Derry told me in a different context, you can't buy skill; you have to develop it yourself, over time. When you realize this, you can better appreciate the creations of the swordsmiths, both ancient and modern.\nAfter Words, A.D. 2001\nI started this researching this series over 10 years ago and it took me about 4 years of somewhat dilatory effort to put the original papers together in comprehensive form. I have learned a lot since then, (some of which I have incorporated in this version) and I intend to learn more. If nothing else, you have learned a simple equation: no steel = no sword. (At least, no better than bronze.) Through much of history steel was as much a luxury as a necessity, and arcane methods were devised to create it and control it. A trade secret is money in the holder's pocket. Today, chunks of good steel litter the highways, good books abound (even if they contradict each other on certain points), and modern craftsmen have succeeded in reproducing all the \"lost arts' and processes that have been discussed in the four papers consolidated and presented here. Some of these craftsmen and artists charge thousands of dollars for their skills, knowledge, and effort; and some are third-world craftsmen eking out a living while feeding commercial Molochs plying the fantasy markets of America with misinformation. Oh well; we'll handle that another day.\nAs I stated before, read the works for yourself. A visit to your local library, and the resources available through the interlibrary loan system and the internet, are astonishing. Who knows what you may discover through research and observation.\nAs we started, so we end:\n'A little learning is a dang'rous thing;\nDrink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.\nThere shallow droughts intoxicate the brain,\nAnd drinking largely sobers us again.\"\nAlexander Pope, Essay on Criticism, Part II, line 15, 1711\n\u00a9 2001 Bruce Edward Blackistone.

There are some basic safety tips and hints about using a knife properly. First of all, check recommendations from sources like Consumer Reports and Cook's Illustrated . Then buy the best quality knives that you can afford, that have no gaps at the joint where the blade and handle meet, with a finely ground blade. A good knife should feel heavy and solid. Finally, learn how to use your good knives and care for them!\nThere are five basic types of kitchen knives:\nChef's Knife\nA chef's knife is usually the largest knife in the kitchen, with a wide blade that is 8\" to 10\" long. Choose a knife that feels good and balanced in your hand. The knife should have a full tang . This means that the blade should go all the way through the handle for the best wear and stability.\nParing Knife\nParing knives are generally 2-1/2-4\" in length. The most often used knife in the kitchen. It is ideal for peeling and coring fruits and vegetables, cutting small objects, slicing, and other hand tasks.\nUtility Knives\nUtility knives are longer than paring knives but smaller than chef's knives, usually around 5-8\" long. They are also called sandwich knives because they are just the right side for slicing meats and cheeses. I have several utility knives in my kitchen as 'extra' knives.\nBoning Knife\nThis type of knife has a more flexible blade to curve around meat and bone. Generally 4-5\" long.\nBread Knife\nBread knives are usually serrated. Most experts recommend a serrated knife that has pointed serrations instead of wavy serrations for better control and longer knife life. I have two bread knives in my kitchen - a long 10\" knife that's great for cutting whole loaves, and a 6\" knife perfect for cutting sandwich buns. You must use a sawing motion when using a serrated knife.\nKnives are made out of several types of material. High carbon stainless steel is the most expensive and will last the longest. These knives will not stain and holds a sharp edge longer than other steel types. Ceramic knives are fairly new. These knives don't need sharpening for years, and should be sharpened by an expert when they do wear down. Only use a ceramic knife on a cutting board - never on another ceramic, plastic or glass surface. They're that sharp!\nKnife handles are made of wood or a plastic composite. Both are good choices. The only difference is in cleaning and maintenance. Knives with wood handles deteriorate more quickly when cleaned in the dishwasher. I know experts recommend not using a dishwasher for washing knives, but I do it all the time. I'm not keen on washing sharp blades by hand.\nSharpening Knives\nA knife that is not sharp is dangerous. It can slip off the food you're cutting and easily cut your fingers instead. A steel should be part of your knife collection. This long, round object sharpens knives by straightening out the edge. Take a look at using a steel to see how to correctly sharpen your knives on a steel. Hold the knife in your dominant hand and the steel in the other, with the steel point pressed into a solid waist-high surface. Hold the knife base at the top of the steel at a 20 degree angle. Slowly draw the knife down the length of the steel, pulling the knife back so the entire blade, from base to tip, moves against the steel, as if you were slicing off pieces of the steel. Repeat on the other side. Do this five or six times , then rinse the knife off and dry immediately. Make sure you sharpen each side the same number of times to retain the knife's balance.\nNow go to the next page to learn how to use a knife properly.\nPrevious\n"}], [{"score": 430.96863, "uuid": "fd19f71b-062a-5a82-aa52-26c8d78e421c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1612wb-19-17233", "target_hostname": "www.flooringsupplyshop.com", "target_uri": "http://www.flooringsupplyshop.com/tags-209/ceramic-soap-dishes-291/", "page_rank": 1.3903532e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>CERAMIC</em> SOAP DISHES : Flooring Supply Shop, Flooring and Floors Heating", "snippet": "<em>I</em> had a tracking... <em>I</em> don\u2019t know how you do it. <em>I</em> ordered two Recess-It Shower... <em>I</em> have purchased several times from flooring supply and <em>I</em> have to...

True Or False?\nIt is a widely accepted shibboleth, appearing in practically every barbecue book ever written: \"If you're lookin', you ain't cookin'\". The message is that when you open the lid of your grill or smoker, cooking slows or stops and each peek adds lots of time to the length of the cook.\nThat's because, with the lid on, heat works on the food from above as well as below. Take the lid off, all the hot air escapes and the food cooks from below only.\nWell, there are times when you want to cook on one side only but most of the time it is better to cook on both sides. In general, you want to cook thin foods on one side at a time so the bottom surface can brown but heat will not penetrate from above. Then, when you flip, you can brown the other side and not risk overcooking it. In other words, some things cook better in a frying pan and some things cook better in the oven, and a grill with the lid on is just an outdoor oven.\nKnow-it-alls like this Meathead have often stated that if you open the lid on a smoker that is cooking low and slow ribs or something like that, you add 15 minutes to the cooking time. The logic is that heat and humidity escape, cold dry air replaces them, and if you are using charcoal or wood, oxygen swoops in and feeds the fire and knocks the equilibrium you worked so hard to establish all outta whack. Worse still, I believed, humidity evaporating from the meat or a water pan would escape and you'd end up with drier meat. The warning against lookin' is meant as a caution to cooks who are constantly basting their food or just admiring their handiwork.\nMakes sense, right? But logic isn't enough for Dr. Greg Blonder , a physicist, entrepreneur, former Chief Technical Advisor at AT&T's legendary Bell Labs, food lover, and the AmazingRibs.com science advisor and mythbuster. Armed with a stopwatch and a thermocouple thermometer with four probes, he set out to test the theory on his gas grill, his pellet smoker, and his charcoal grill.\nLookin' inside a gas grill\nSo one fine October day, with the ambient air temp in the 70s, Blonder cranked his Charmglow three burner standard gas grill to high and after a while it settled in just north of 475\u00b0F near the center of the cooking grate about 2\" above the surface.\nThen he opened the lid for one minute. Boom! The air temp dove to about 150\u00b0F. When he closed the lid, it climbed almost all the way back in a minute or two. \"No harm, no foul\" says Blonder.\nThen he opened it for five minutes. The temp dove to around 200\u00b0F rapidly and stayed there while the lid was up. When he closed the lid it got back up to 400\u00b0F pretty quickly but it took almost 10 minutes to level off at more than 450\u00b0F and another 10 minutes to get back up to 475\u00b0F.\nWhen the lid is opened for only a minute, some of the hot air remains trapped under the lid, the metal in the lid remains hot, and the metal grates on the cooking surface don't have a chance to cool off. But when it is opened for five minutes, the hot air trapped under the lid bleeds off, ambient air infiltrates, the lid gets cool, and the cooking grates drop in temp. Once the metal has cooled off, it takes time to heat it back up. He explains \"The reason it takes so long to reheat is the gas grill, unlike a kitchen oven, has no temperature sensor or feedback. Unaware the temperature has dropped, it doesn't increase the gas flame in response.\"\nLookin' inside a pellet smoker\nThen he rolled out his MAK 1 Star pellet smoker , set it for 200\u00b0F and tossed in a five pound pork butt. He set a probe in the center of the meat, another 1/2\" below the surface, and another about 2\" above the cooking surface near to the meat.\nA one minute peek was nearly invisible (the chart for that is not shown). But when he opened it for five minutes, the air temp quickly dropped and bottomed out at just over 100\u00b0F (the green line in the chart). But most pellet smokers have thermostat control like your indoor oven, \"a negative feedback circuit\" in physicist speak. As a result it burned more pellets and pushed more air to the firepot so the recovery was rapid, about 2 minutes, in fact, 1/5 the time it took for the gas grill to recover. In fact, it overshot the mark by more than 50\u00b0F and then settled in to the target temp.\nBut here's the most interesting data: The probe placed near the meat's surface dropped only about 3\u00b0F (the blue line), and another probe in the center of the meat (red line) continued to climb pretty steadily despite the cooling of the grill, warmed not by the air, but by heat transferred inward from the warm meat on the outside.\nClick here for more info on how these clever new pellet cookers work .\nLookin' inside a charcoal grill\nFinally Blonder took out his Weber Kettle and fired it up. With hot coals and a chicken on board, it hit close to 450\u00b0F in a hurry. Again he opened the lid for one minute. Boom. Down to 150\u00b0F almost instantly. He put the lid back on and the temp recovered in about two minutes to about 400\u00b0F.\nWhen he took the lid off for five minutes the temperature bounced back fairly quickly, but never got higher than 350\u00b0F, because, even with the lid on, as the coals burn down, the temperature in a charcoal grill slowly declines.\nThe lesson is that the effect of opening the lid on a charcoal grill like the Weber Kettle is greater than on gas or pellets because the heating potential of charcoal is limited. It eventually diminishes and burns out. So you are not only losing cooking time, you are losing cooking time at a higher temp.\nWhat about the chicken? As with the pork on the pellet grill, the meat responded to the opening of the grill, but only near the surface, and only slightly. The center barely blipped.\nHeavy duty grills and smokers\nAlas, neither Blonder nor I own one of those big sofa sized heavy duty rigs that competition cooks use (that's one of the top competitors, Johnny Trigg with his Jambo cooker below).\nSome of these professional cookers are made from steel 1/8 to 1/4\" thick, and all that iron really absorbs the heat. There are also cookers that have double walls, insulation, and some are built of thick ceramic materials to help retain heat. It takes a long time for those babies to heat up and cool off. So Blonder built a simulator. He took two aluminum plates 12\" wide x 12\" long by 1/2\" thick and connected them so they were 1.75\" apart.\nHe put his metal plate sandwich in the center of his gas grill. He turned on the left and right burners and set them for medium, but left the middle burner off so there was no heat directly below them. He put one digital probe above the sandwich near the lid, and another floating in the center of the sandwich. The first thing you notice is that the probe near the dome is 100\u00b0F hotter than the probe in the plate. That's because heat often builds up under the dome and is often much hotter than down where the food is. \"Yet another reason to ignore the built-in dial thermometer\" says Blonder. Anyone who reads this site knows this is a crusade I have been on for years .\nAn impertinent question for Weber and other gas grill manufacturers\nBlonder's work raises some more prickly questions.\nWhy do grill manufacturers continue to use crappy bi-metal dial thermometers in the digital age? And why do they place them in a location high above the food since the food we are cooking is several inches below? But a more important question is why aren't they installing thermostats?\nIndoor ovens have had thermostat controls since about 1915.\nWood pellet burning grill/smokers have had thermostats since they first appeared in the early 1990s and they are the hottest new category of grill with more than a dozen manufacturers appearing in the past five years . That's the state of the art MAK Grill thermostat at right, complete with programmable settings and three jacks for meat probes.\nThe BBQ Guru , a thermostat controller for charcoal grills that controls airflow to the coals first appeared in 2004, and there are two competitors now on the market, Rock's Stoker and the iQue 110 .\nWhen in the name of iPhone will Weber or one of the other high end grill builders put simple thermostats on gas grills? Most replacement thermostats for an indoor oven cost under $100 retail. Surely a major grill manufacturer could add a push button control system just like your indoor oven for about $100. What's the problem?\nMeanwhile, if you own a gas or charcoal grill and don't have a quality digital oven and meat thermometer yet, please read my article on thermometers and order one.\nMore on the subject\n"}, {"score": 408.02197, "uuid": "0df22e90-81fa-5b25-a111-412f5cb8fed4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400tw-76-08275", "target_hostname": "www.gnolls.org", "target_uri": "http://www.gnolls.org/1517/the-paleo-starter-kit-part-i-a-functional-paleo-kitchen/", "page_rank": 1.2118839e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "The Paleo Starter Kit, Part <em>I</em>: A Functional Paleo Kitchen - GNOLLS.ORG", "snippet": "<em>Ceramic</em> <em>knives</em> are great for cutting\u2026but you can\u2019t use them for boning, <em>or</em> for anything where the blade might hit something hard.

You\u2019re taking a big step towards better health and more energy.\nBut as you survey your kitchen, you realize that your refrigerator contains only beer and condiments, your freezer is full of precooked industrial products, your pantry is full of bread and pasta, you\u2019re eating out all the time anyway\u2014and suddenly you\u2019re expected to instantly know how to cook all your own food from scratch when you can\u2019t even use the few recipes you know?\nFear not! We are eating like predators, but that doesn\u2019t mean we have to eat raw wildebeest out of a mud puddle that an elephant crapped in.\nLet\u2019s get started!\nKitchen Tools and Utensils\nYou don\u2019t need a cupboard full of gadgets to cook and eat delicious food. I am all about the 80% solution: 20% of the effort (and cash outlay) solves 80% of your problems. And frankly, these are tools you should own no matter what kind of food you cook.\nFor your convenience, I provide links to purchase many of these supplies from Amazon\u2026but if you can find them cheaper locally, go for it!\nI assume you already have a functional stove and oven, and some basic kitchen supplies like a 3-quart saucepan , measuring cups and spoons , and a dish brush .\nYou must have a good 12\u2033 covered skillet.\nIf you\u2019re a kitchen klutz who will burn or scratch a non-stick pan, get a cast-iron skillet . (Here\u2019s the glass cover .) Cast iron takes longer to heat up, heats less evenly, and it\u2019s more trouble to keep clean and seasoned, but you\u2019ll never completely destroy it and it\u2019ll sear a steak better. (Seasoning and maintaining cast iron is a whole another article in itself.)\nHowever, I recommend a non-stick skillet: it heats up more evenly, cleans up more quickly, and is far more convenient to use. Non-stick cookware requires careful care, though: you must be careful to never overheat it, and you must NEVER use metal utensils. This one is quite usable , and here\u2019s what I have . And here is a nylon spatula if you don\u2019t already own one.\nYou must have a decent chef\u2019s knife, and a steel to keep it sharp.\nYou don\u2019t need a $100+ Henckels, Shun, or Wusthof so long as it\u2019s forged, high-carbon stainless and you know how to sharpen it. This is the cheapest usable set I\u2019ve found because it includes the steel. If you\u2019ve got a higher budget, I\u2019ve owned these for over ten years. And you can spend as much as you like\u2026but if you want a handmade work of art, not just an expensive brand name, I would go here .\nNote that you only need one chef\u2019s knife: think of the smaller ones in the set as slightly inferior backups.\nYou must have at least two large cutting boards.\nThis lets you dedicate one board to meat, so you don\u2019t have to worry about cross-contamination. Also, an outer groove is important when you\u2019re cutting lots of meat so you don\u2019t get blood on your counter.\nWood is more hygenic, being naturally antibacterial, but you must keep it oiled or it\u2019ll split\u2014and if it doesn\u2019t have rubber \u201cfeet\u201d, you must prop it up to dry or it\u2019ll warp. Here\u2019s a reasonably priced, usable set : some swankier alternatives are here and here .\nPlastic harbors far more bacteria than wood ( reference \u2014hat tip to reader Scotlyn), but it\u2019s dishwasher-safe and nearly impossible to ruin. These are good and well-priced.\nYou must have refrigerator storage containers to hold meat, veggies, and leftovers.\nStretching plastic wrap over bowls and plates gets old quickly: Gladware, Takealongs, and Ziploc are the three big brands of reusable containers. Get two that are large enough to hold a roast or a steak, several that are large enough to hold a few vegetables, like a partially-used onion, pepper, and avocado, and several to hold individual servings of food so you can freeze them, take them to work, or just store leftovers. Stay away from off-brands: they often don\u2019t seal correctly.\nThese will be much cheaper at the supermarket\u2014but if you can\u2019t find the big ones, try here (click on \u201cLarge Rectangle\u201d).\nYou must have a 6-quart or larger slow cooker.\nGet the kind with the lid that seals tightly: I like this one . The inner ceramic pot will double as an oven-safe container for roasts, stews, and chili.\nCooking Fats\nSince seed oils are now off limits, you\u2019ll need some delicious saturated fats to cook with!\nYou must have at least one pound of butter in your refrigerator at all times.\nThis rule is not negotiable. Butter is cheap, it\u2019s available everywhere, and it makes everything taste better. (Yes, there are paleo purists who eschew butter: unless you\u2019re frankly allergic, I view this as re-enactment, not science.)\nThe downside of butter is that it burns at a relatively low temperature, so you\u2019ll have to limit your high-temperature frying and sauteeing, or use something else, like\u2026\nStrongly consider coconut oil.\nVirgin oil tastes like coconut and burns a bit more easily\u2026refined oil is more neutral-tasting and stands up better to hotter cooking temperatures. There are some claimed health benefits to the virgin/unrefined stuff, but it\u2019s tough to cook with unless you want everything to taste like coconuts. I use organic refined coconut oil for most of my cooking.\nGrocery stores often hide coconut oil in the \u201chealth food\u201d section. If you can\u2019t find it, I buy mine here .\nConsider ghee.\nGhee is butter from which the residual proteins, sugars, and water have been removed (\u2018clarified butter\u2019), leaving only pure butterfat. It\u2019s frequently used in Indian cooking, and is suitable for high-temperature cooking and frying. And it\u2019s delicious!\nGhee is hard to find except at Indian markets: you can buy some here , and the big jar here . Make sure it\u2019s real ghee: there exist synthetic seed-oil based ghee substitutes which are equivalent to margarine, and which are just as unhealthy.\nIt\u2019s actually not difficult to make your own ghee from regular store-bought butter: you can make a big batch in about half an hour. Here\u2019s a tutorial : the more you make at once, the easier it is to just pour off the ghee, as the solids mostly stay at the bottom.\nConsider beef tallow, preferably grass-fed.\nUnfortunately it\u2019s almost impossible to find because of rampant saturated fat phobia, but it\u2019s my favorite cooking fat for meat dishes and potatoes. I only know one source, and it\u2019s expensive, costing over $10/pound for 2.25 pounds (but under $3/pound if you buy 5 gallons ). If you have time, you can wet-render your own: here\u2019s a tutorial .\nLive in freedom, live in beauty.\nJS\nAre you getting hungry? Yes, you are.

And of course you just KNOW you're paying too much if there isn't the ever-present \"big 20% off sale\" sign in the window. Or you're expected to bargain with some sales clerk or owner (which I HATE doing) just to get what should be a fair and clearly posted price to begin with. With the internet and cable network food shows, I could clearly see that both professionals and serious home cooks had moved beyond these old brands and were discovering real gems from around the world, both in terms of brands, and also in terms of styles, shapes, and overall design. And so I'm very proud and happy to make these incredible knives available to my fellow Canadians at truly fair every-day discounted prices! And remember, if you still need help deciding what to buy, or are looking for a gift and don't know where to start, feel free to contact me !\nPrice Comparisons: I try to be as competitive as possible with suppliers outside of Canada. When making comparisons, please remember that the exchange rate you'll actually pay is actually about 2% above the official rate (the credit card companies and PayPal take 2% as their conversion fee); you'll pay 7% duty (yes, there is at least 7% duty on knives coming into Canada), and you'll pay between $5 and $8 brokerage/handling fee from Canada Post (and this fee will be well over $50 if you use UPS, Fedex or some other such shipper); my shipping charges are generally half (or less) than what you'll pay to ship from a US company into Canada; and you'll have no duty/brokerage delays and hassles that cross-border shopping often entails.\nWhat should you order?\nIf you're not sure where to start in putting together a quality knife collection? Here are some of my personal favourites best bets depending on your budget and personal style and preferences:\nPrimary knife: Start with a good all-purpose knife. This is what you'll probably end up using 90% of the time in your everyday home or professional kitchen.\nSantoku : This style is light, thin, sharp and easy to handle. Popular with men and women, it's great for just about any cooking style. Razor sharp and versatile -- a super choice for home cooks: trust me, you'll never go back to the old chef's knife style once you switch to a Santoku and learn to appreciate the smaller size and increased versatility of the blade shape. The Santoku is the traditional Japanese cook's knife, so you can rest assured that it functions just fine as an everyday knife, and as you can see by many celebrity chefs on TV, this style of knife is gaining many converts outside of the Asian community now. Top picks:\nEasy Maintenance, Rugged, Affordable: Wusthof Classic Santoku , Classic IKON , Grand Prix II Santoku or Culinar Santoku : beautiful knife, super-sharp, great-looking. I use the Classic version at home (the others are pretty much the same... just different handles, so just choose the one you like best). I love the new Classic IKON and would definitely choose that model if I had to pick one today. A truly great knife, that I everyone is thrilled with. Rachael Ray of FoodTV's 30-Minute Meals uses the Classic version of this exact santoku (before she signed an endorsement deal with another company).\nThinner, Sharper, Harder Steel, Affordable: If you're thinking of trying a real Japanese knife, I'd have no hestitation in recommending a Misono Molybdenum Santoku or a Sakai Takayuki Santoku . These are very nice knives: sharp and durable and very well made with great fit and finish, at a truly fantastic price -- all-around great values without a doubt (don't let the affordable prices fool you!). The Sakai Takayuki Japanese-made damascus santokus are now my best-selling santokus, and they are very sharp and high quality, and an incredible value if you love that damascus look (and who doesn't!) And if you're thinking of going old-school with the ultimate performance of a carbon steel blade, don't miss a superb Moritaka santoku !\nHardest Steel, Super Sharp, Best Looks and Performance: And if you want something really high-end with superb steel and incredible balance and the best construction quality, check out the Takayuki 63-layer and Misono UX10 Santoku and see why these are now my #1 best seller among professional chefs and serious home cooks. Both are truly superb high-end knives.\nClassic Chef's/Cook's Knife: if you prefer a traditional European/Western shape, go with a standard French/German chef's/cook's knife. The added length and curve of the blade can be very comfortable if you're used to the traditional \"rocking\" motion. You can't go wrong with any of these:\nWusthof Classic , Classic IKON , Grand Prix II , Le Cordon Bleu or Culinar Cook's Knife. Great looking, and serious performance and durability. Or again, if you're thinking of trying a Japanese knife because you want something lighter and thinner than a German knife but prefer a traditional shape, the Misono Molybdenum and UX10 chef's knives are light, strong, and an abolute pleasure to own and use. You're in love with the damascus steel look?...then check out this beautiful Sakai Takayuki 8.3\" model. Or if you're in love with the idea of a granton edge (dimples) Japanese knife and want something really nice without breaking the bank, the Sakai Takayuki ( 8.3\" or 9.5\" ) are fantastic and a great value (they're made with excellent and hard steel, and very durable handles). Should you get an 8\" or a 9\" chef's knife? Well, traditionally the 8\" chef's knife has been a standard, but these days, many people opt instead for a santoku which is just a little bit smaller but perhaps more versatile and easier to handle. The 8\" chef's knife is certainly still the best-selling size, but if you're a professional chef or culinary school student or if you already have a santoku and want something bigger to complement it, then it can make sense to move up to a 9\" or 10\" (or 240mm/9.5\" in the case of Japanese knives) chef's knife. Most Japanese knives are also thinner and lighter than the German knives like the Wusthof Classic/GrandPrix2/Culinar chef's knives, and they don't have bolsters, so the very base (heel) of the blade is a bit more useful (if you aren't already used to using a knife with a bolster). For example, the Misono Molybdenum Series 24cm Chef's Knife is 1cm longer than the Wusthof Classic 9\", but a full 32 grams (12%) lighter. Mind you, if you really prefer the profile of the traditional cook's knife, then by all means go with an 8\" chef's knife if you're comfortable with that -- I'm sure you'll be pleased. Again, the Wusthof are superb and constantly winning awards and \"best bets\" from major publications because they work well, they're rugged, and they're easy to maintain and sharpen -- a real no-brainer if you just want a no-nonsense knife to cook dinner with. Or if you want the incredible performance of a real carbon steel (not stainless) blade, don't miss the incredible Moritaka knives available in all the most popular sizes.\nConsider yourself more \"old school\" and want some heavy iron? Then go for a professional size for serious kitchen action: consider the larger 10\" (260mm) Wusthof Cook's models (all professional-level knives), or a 9.5\" Japanese knife, like the top-of-the-line Misono UX10 or one of the many excellent Sakai Takayuki models.\nSecondary knife: A small paring knife for fruit and vegetable peeling, paring, slicing and other small jobs, and a utility knife. Top picks: I prefer small/short paring knives, so I like the small size and razor-sharp edge of the Wusthof 3.5\" Paring knives (all lines) and Sakai Takayuki 3.2\" Paring knives -- it's a knife you'll see professional chefs use a lot when they want something for preparing small or delicate items where a full-size chef's knife is overkill. Similarly, a 4-5\" \"utility knife\" is also a great second knife choice if you already have some paring knives that are doing the trick. Again, the Japananese Misono Molybdenum Utility/Petty knives are really nice, and different in shape than a Wusthof utility knife, in that they are shaped more like mini chef's knives rather than large paring knives -- not that one is necessarily better than the other, but it's something to think about. The Takayuki 5.3\" utility knife is very good-looking and an excellent performer at a great price -- my #1 most popular such utility knife now, and very handy for smaller slicing/dicing jobs like onion, ginger and garlic.\nSlicer (also called Carving Knife): If you like to purchase and prepare larger cuts of meat yourself (whole chickens, etc.), then a slicer/carving knife is a great knife to have. The blade is thin and narrow in profile, and so a nice item to have for more delicate work (thin slicing), or even for cutting sandwiches (I like the thin blade for cutting delicate cakes too). This is a standard item in many of the old-fashioned \"sets\" sold by other manufacturers. If you like to prepare fresh fish and larger cuts of meat, be sure to also invest in a boning knife or fine fish fillet knife. I carry the longer Wusthof fillet knives which are more useful and versatile than the short fillet knives more retail outlets carry (why are people scared of long knives?!?) The Misono long slicers are also superb, with the one wielded by TV's \"Top Chef\" being popular, and the Sakai Takayuki line offers a number of superb Japanese slicers at quite reasonable prices. Or for the more standard \"carving knives\" like we're all used to, check out the fine Wusthof models. See my full selection here .\nBread Knife/Roast Knife: Unless you're a dedicated sliced-bread person, every household should have a good bread knife. And by good, I mean BIG! What's with all these companies making klunky thick-bladed 8-inch \"bread\" knives?!? That's really too small to be useful for slicing larger loaves or artisan-bakery bread, or even for doing pretty common baking jobs like slicing cake layers. That's why I prefer to sell bread knives that are at least 9\" in length, which in my mind is the ideal size for home use. The slicers and bread knives I sell are all fine for the job, with nice thin and sharp blades, which make short work of crusty bread or meats. A serrated slicer is also handy for general baking/pastry jobs. All in all, a thin-bladed serrated slicer is an incredibly useful tool to have around the kitchen. I find myself using mine all the time when I'm dealing with something with a crusty edge that I need to get through without crushing a delicate interior. Not too keen on big unsliced loaves of bread or you don't have lots of space in your knife block for such a big blade? Then the \"offset serrated\" knife is a great option. Yes, it's shorter, but in a way it's really a more versatile knife, capable of dealing with all kinds of breads and other crusty items, including roast meats, veggies, etc. Anthony Bourdain recommends this style of knife, as does famous pastry chef Sherry Yard, and I keep seeing chefs on Food Network Canada using offset serrated knives too (I just saw several on one night's episode of Iron Chef America for example). One very sharp, very strong and very big serrated knife which makes a killer bread knife and yet isn't too expensive is the Wusthof Gourmet 10\" Confectioner's Knife -- if you want a BIG serrated knife but don't want to spend the extra big money, this one is certainly a nice option (and it cuts like CRAZY). Otherwise, the most popular traditional \"bread knife\" I sell is the Wusthof Classic 9\" (forged, very nice, very strong, perfect length; also available in the other handle styles ).\nSharpener: yes, you'll need to do a bit of regular maintenance to keep your nice new knife razor-sharp. In my opinion, the easiest way to do this is simply with a steel. They're really not that complicated to use. Check out the links below for more information or here for my full knife sharpening tools selection .\nYou know, if you don't already have a good steel, before you do anything else, go ahead and get one like the standard high quality Wusthof steel , good for just about any knife out there (except serrated knifes, which should be sharpened by a professional). You don't need the fancy handle of the more expensive models -- this one works just fine, and the nice 10\" length means it's big enough to sharpen even a serious chef's knife blade easily. The trick is to simply use it regularly -- DON'T wait until your knife is dull. You should actually give your knife a few light strokes on the steel once a week (or every few days even). This way your knife will stay sharp and won't NEED a serious re-sharpening by a pro or by some sharpening system. The trick is to maintain the edge so you don't have to create a new one. A very affordable and essential too! This is the same sort of steel included in all \"sets\" and in 99% of the kitchen stores out there, but in a more versatile 10\" length for sharpening longer chef's knives. Update: as of 2009 I am now using my 10\" fine ceramic hone on all my knives and have all but retired my trusty old steel. Now that I've gotten used to the ceramic, well, I just like how consistent and gentle it is... read on...\nCeramic honing rods: much has been said about ceramic and steel honing rods by ill-informed North-American Japanese knife distributors and importers. You'll often hear from these \"experts\" (they're usually simply business-people -- importers/distributors -- NOT knife makers, experts or even chefs) that you CAN'T use a steel on a Japanese knife, or that a steel will \"ruin\" a Japanese knife edge somehow, and so they sell you their junky drag-through systems with carbide that just tear up the edge of the knife. Now, a ceramic rod does work, but you have to understand that a fine ceramic is very fine -- almost not abrasive at all, and Japanese knife steel is normally harder than German knife steel, so you have to use it regularly (daily, or at least a few times a week), or else it simply won't do a darn thing. So if you have a Japanese or other knife with a similar polished edge (the Misono Japanese knives have polished edges), then a ceramic is a good choice. I personally think that some knives with a ground edge (most German knives) can keep that nice \"bite\" in their edge better with a traditional steel (metal), but the difference can be subtle. Mind you, I also use a steel on Global and other knives, and it works fine for me (with a gentle touch!). Your mileage may vary. A LOT depends on your honing technique -- a light touch and reverse honing (drag the knife so that the edge trails on the steel -- try it, it works!) with a butcher's steel can do wonders. Okay, back to ceramic: I was tired of the small and cheap junk sold by the North American Japanese knife distributors, so I sought out a quality manufacturer and imported them directly. The 10\" ceramic hones I sell are great, and VERY reasonably priced. And if you don't want to bother with stones and want something with some actual abrasion to help when the edge really starts to get worn (this can take as long as a year or more at home, IF you use your fine hone regularly!), I also sell the coarser model to help bring the edge back. And my new all-in-one real Japanese waterstone is fantastic if you want the ultimate in old-school versatility and quality!\nTo restore a dull edge (when the steel no longer does the job), you can use a ceramic or diamond \"steel\" (see the Wusthof fine and medium ), or one of the easy to use and pretty foolproof sharpening systems by Chef's Choice. , or if you want the control and quality that only a stone and hand sharpening can give you, go for Japanese water stones , or for a stone-style edge but with ultimate angle control, the stone-based Edge Pro system gives you the quality and control of hand sharpening on a stone, combined with the control over angles of a machine (this is also the best choice if you have both Japanese and German knives, since you can change the angle). Chad Ward's new book An Edge in the Kitchen also highly recommends the EdgePro system as the best of the manual guide-based sharpening systems.\nDIMPLES: Since so many people ask: in my opinion, dimples (a \"granton\" edge) on a santoku or chef's knife do nothing (or VERY little at least). They were designed for thin slicers, but manufacturers put them on everything now because they look cool and help sell knives. Fact: dimples do NOT reduce \"suction\" and \"sticking\" like some people and sellers claim -- it's really just about reducing friction: since there is less material for the food to contact with as it passes the cutting edge, theoretically you should be able to get paper thin slices a bit more easily. But a good chef just needs a good sharp knife and a little practice to get precise and thin slices, not gimmicks. If you like the look and it's not much more money, then fine (I'll admin, they DO look kind of cool!), but I wouldn't let dimples affect my decision on a particular knife purchase. Get the best knife you can for your budget that suits your needs and personal preferences in terms of materials, shape and handle styles, and don't let dimples factor into the decision until the end!\nPaul's Knife Hints & Tips\nRemember, a knife is a tool designed for cutting. A sharp edge cuts better than a dull edge (!), so it follows that a sharp knife is a better tool. So keep in mind that a sharp knife is a safe knife, because it allows for more precise control and effortless slicing, chopping and cutting, resulting in fewer opportunities for slippage and accidental mishandling. Basically, a sharp knife lets you concentrate on the job at hand, without worrying about putting tons of pressure on the blade or about ruining a delicate item you're trying to prepare. So get the best, sharpest knives you can afford, treat them with care, keep them sharp, and they should last you a lifetime.\nForget the fancy rapid-fire knife-handling you see on TV. Take your time, remembering to always keep your fingers of the guiding hand (not holding the knife) tucked inwards, away from the blade, and your thumb tucking in behind your fingers and not sticking out as most of us do without thinking! Don't put tons of pressure on the blade. A good sharp knife is a good cutting tool, so let it do its job -- there should be no need (most of the time) to push down really hard, and this is especially true with a serrated edge, which is designed to cut just fine with gentle and steady pressure and movement, without hacking away! If you really need to hack away at something, use a tool for the job: a cleaver or other heavy duty knife, not your little 6\" utility knife! And remember, don't just push down; let the sharp edge do its job by using a nice steady slicing action.\nIn terms of care, try to wash your knife as soon as possible after use (NEVER leave it in a sink with dirty dishes), dry it and then put it back safely in a proper knife block or magnetic strip, and not in a drawer where it'll bang around or where someone could stick their hand in by accident. Don't put your knifes in the dishwasher, and don't use abrasives or chemicals to clean them. And of course use them for cutting ONLY! They're not hammers, screwdrivers, or pry bars. A good knife blade is extremely strong when used vertically in a normal cutting motion, but with very hard steel sharpened to a fine edge (as it will be on most good Japanese knives!), it could chip or could even snap if you try to use if for something like prying. Finally, use a good plastic or wooden cutting board, NOT a glass or metal or stone counter or board, as a sharp edge hitting a stone surface is of course a recipe for dulling!\nSharpening: Sharpening knives is probably the only thing that arouses more passions, opinions and dogma than buying and using the knives themselves! One thing: don't just jump in and hack away with your old coarse sharpening steel. This might have been fine to restore some semblance of an edge on your old knives, but it can seriously junk the razor-sharp and precisely-ground edge on your new Japanese knife, so don't just go at it, and don't let your well-meaning friend or family member (why does it always seem to be a brother-in-law?!?) do you the favour either. And again, if you do need to touch up your blade (which is normal), go slowly and avoid the theatrics of swiping the blade over the steel in a swash-buckling manner like you'll sometimes see TV chefs do when in full \"performance\" mode. Go slowly, maintain a precise and steady angle (which is why you should take your time!), and check the blade frequently so you don't do more than necessary to restore the edge. But since I don't profess to be a professional in this area, here are some resources to get you started:\nLoads of sharpening info at eGullet (and the author of this big page has now expanded it into a new book that I would recommend for anyone wanting to learn more about knives and sharpening: An Edge in the Kitchen )\nMy current sharpening systems inventory.\nCategories\n"}, {"score": 340.20712, "uuid": "79c9d2be-c846-5151-bf41-71d3edfbb7aa", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1811wb-02-07460", "target_hostname": "4knife.com", "target_uri": "http://4knife.com/boker-cera-titan-chef-knives/58-boker-cera-titan-ziracote-1-chef-knife.html", "page_rank": 1.2396285e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "Boker Cera-Titan Ziracote 1 Chef knife", "snippet": "To re-sharpen a Cera-Titan blade, we recommend using a <em>ceramic</em> <em>or</em> diamond-coated sharpening device for manual sharpening.

I will give some important details about these tools. This information will help you purchase, use, and properly maintain them, so that you too will have them for a lifetime and beyond. I will also share some of mom\u0092s tips on other common items found in the kitchen.\nIn the recipe section you will find a few of the recipes my mom prepared only for the two of us. These recipes produce simple but elegant and satisfying foods that I am sure you will enjoy preparing and sharing with your own family.\nKitchen measurement\nHere is a vital cooking tool that many cooks take for granted until confronted with a recipe that is designed to produce more or less than the number of portions desired. Adjusting recipes up or down by \u00bc, 1/3, or \u00bd is a frequent occurrence. Often a busy cook will estimate amounts rather then calculate them. Guessing can cause some serious problems with some recipes, especially when baking or making sauces. If one doesn\u0092t know that a tablespoon is equal to 3 teaspoons or 2/3 of a cup is equal to 10 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons, adjusting recipes can become a frustrating hit-or-miss nightmare.\nTo help you with this problem I have provided, on the following page, a list of measurements, a table of Equivalent Measurements, that my mom kept hanging on the refrigerator door. I\u0092ve been over these numbers many times and have not yet been able to memorize them. So, just like my mom, I keep a copy stuck on the refrigerator. I also keep a copy in my wallet to use at work. Cut out this little table and put it in a conspicuous place in your kitchen. You will be surprised how often you will use it as a convenient reference.\nThe kitchen knife\nOne chilly fall day my mom was busy cutting a large piece of beef chuck into cubes for a stew. As usual, I was sitting at the kitchen table doing homework listening to her hum one of her favorite Kate Smith songs while she worked. Suddenly she stopped cutting and turned around. My conditioned response to these sudden pauses was to stop what I was doing and listen.\n\u0093The most important tool in any kitchen,\u0094 she said, \u0093is a good quality knife with a sharp blade.\u0094 Then she returned to her cutting. After she finished cutting the meat, she carefully washed her knife in warm soapy water, rinsed it, and set it aside while she cleared the meat from the counter. After washing and sanitizing her old wooden cutting board, she proceeded to prepare and dice four different vegetables with the same knife. She stopped only once to restore the razor edge of her knife by stroking it a couple of times on a butcher\u0092s steel.\nThe knife she was using was a 10-inch, heavy-gauge, high-carbon steel chef\u0092s knife. She used this knife to do most chopping and dicing. She owned three other carbon steel knives: a small paring knife with a 4-inch blade, a straight backed boning knife with a 6-inch blade, and a nonserrated slicing knife with a 12-inch blade. The latter three knives were used only to do specialized cutting. She bought these knives, on sale, in 1962, and they are still used in my kitchen today.\nIt is not possible to prepare food properly without a good set of sharp knives, even in our modern kitchens that have high tech equipment like the food processor. Working with knives that won\u0092t hold a sharp edge, or can\u0092t be properly sharpened after they become dull, is dangerous and inefficient. How can a dull knife be more dangerous than a sharp one? A cook using a very sharp knife to cut food will use the same care as a barber using a straight razor to shave a man\u0092s face. A cook using a dull knife is more inclined to use greater force when cutting, which increases the danger of the knife slipping. A dull knife also crushes and tears instead of cutting, making food look unattractive and often not usable. Trying to slice a ripe tomato with a dull knife will illustrate this point.\nHaving said all of that, a few questions come to mind: What types of steel are used to make kitchen knives, and how do they differ?\nBroadly speaking, steel is an alloy made from iron, carbon, and other metals such as chromium and nickel. Kitchen knives are most often made with three varieties of steel. For many years high-carbon steel, which is iron mixed with a high percentage of carbon, was the standard material of kitchen knives. Heavy-gauge knives made with this alloy were the first choice of all serious cooks. But a carbon steel knife is vulnerable to\nthe acids in many foods. If the knife is not washed after contact with foods like citrus fruits, onions, and tomatoes the steel will chemically react with the acid causing the blade to develop ugly black stains and even rust. These reactions will transfer nasty tasting flavors to foods. Since few modern-day American cooks are willing to spend a lot of time caring for their knives, high-carbon steel knives are hard to find in this country. It\u0092s a shame because heavy-gauge, high-carbon steel is unequaled in its ability to hold a razor-sharp edge.\nIn 1912 steel manufacturers began adding measured amounts of chromium and nickel to the carbon steel formula, and stainless steel was born. By 1920 knives made from this carefree steel were on the market. Today stainless steel knives, made with a high percentage of carbon, are by far the most popular knives sold. However, for serious old-time cooks, like myself, these knives can seem to be frustratingly dull and slow cutting when compared to their older carbon steel cousins. This is because it is physically impossible to sharpen a stainless steel blade to the same degree as one made of high-carbon steel.\nKitchen knives are also manufactured with a steel alloy that I call ultra-stainless steel. This variety of stainless steel contains a high percentage of chromium, nickel, or other hard metal. Knives made with it are easily recognized by their brilliant chrome-like appearance and they are often sold through the infomercials on late night television. Manufacturers of these knives claim their product comes with a razor sharp edge and will never need sharpening. The truth is that these knives will lose that razor edge over time, leaving you with a super hard steel blade that can\u0092t be sharpened without special machinery. I see lots of these knives thrown into obsolete tool boxes in commercial kitchens, waiting to be recycled.\nWhat should you buy?\nQuality manufacturers like Dexter, Henckels, and Wursthof make high-quality, heavy-gauge, high-carbon stainless steel knives that are carefree and hold an edge that will satisfy the needs of most cooks. I suggest that you buy top of the line, heavy-gauge knives from one of these manufacturers. A close look at one of these high quality knives will reveal some important features. The tang\u0097that part of the knife enclosed in the handle\u0097will run the full length of the handle and will be secured by at least three rivets. The handle should be made of hardwood or wood and plastic composite, be easy to grip, feel comfortable in your hand, and be in balance with the blade (i.e., the knife\u0092s center of gravity should be where the tang disappears into the handle).\nThe three knives that my mom gave me have all of these qualities and have survived over 30 years of hard kitchen use. With proper care and handling, I am confident that they will be in use for another 30 or 40 years.\nHow to keep your knives sharp\nYou need only three tools to keep your kitchen knives sharp and clean-cutting: a whetstone, a small bottle of honing oil, and a butcher\u0092s steel. A whetstone is a very hard block, usually made of a mixture of silicone and carbon called carborundum. It can be purchased at most hardware stores.\nA butcher\u0092s steel is simply a hardened rough-faced iron bar with a wooden handle.\nThe whetstone is used to revive the cutting edge of a knife that has been worn away by repeated use. The butcher\u0092s steel is used to straighten the cutting edge of a knife that has been bent as the result of coming into contact with the hard surface of a cutting board during a chopping task. The following is important to remember, especially when using stainless steel knives: the cutting edge of a knife is very thin and the impact of this very thin edge on any surface will break it off or bend it. If a knife is good quality and is being used properly, three or four strokes on each side of the cutting edge using a butcher\u0092s steel will straighten the cutting edge.\nCareful use and regular stroking on a butcher\u0092s steel, unfortunately, are not enough to keep that razor edge on even the highest quality knives when they are used frequently. Regular use simply wears the edge away and a whetstone is the best way to restore it. Using a whetstone properly takes a little practice but once the process is understood, reestablishing the cutting edge on your knives will be a quick and easy task.\nThe proper way to hone a knife\nThe most important step in honing a knife is to establish the correct angle that the blade will be held to the stone and always maintain that angle during the honing process. My mom taught me that 25 degrees is best. This angle seems to produce a tough long-lasting edge on the blade. A honing angle less than this produces a very thin edge that will bend easily and wear away fast. Always apply a thin coat of honing oil to the stone before you begin sharpening. Honing oil is a refined mineral oil manufactured for use on sharpening stones and to lubricate machines that come in contact with food. If you can\u0092t find honing oil, use water. No other oils are suitable for use with a whetstone.\nAfter coating the stone with oil or water, place the blade across the stone at the proper angle. Draw the blade toward you so that the whole blade passes over the stone, from handle to tip, in one motion. Turn the blade over, place it on the stone at the proper angle, and push it away from you so that the stroke covers the entire blade, from handle to tip. To develop a balanced cutting edge, it is important to make an equal number of strokes on each side of the blade. The first honing of a new blade will usually take some effort because the honing angle you are trying to establish may not be consistent with the one established by the manufacturer. Once you have established your custom edge, future sharpening will take very little effort\u0097unless your knife has been damaged from misuse or become severely dulled as a result of neglect.\nIf you use oil on your whetstone, clean the stone after each use by wiping it with a clean cloth. Clean it under warm running water if you use water.\nCutting boards\nYour beautifully honed knife is constantly being subjected to all sorts of damage every time it makes contact with a cutting surface such as a counter top, butcher block, or cutting board. The harder the cutting surface the quicker your knife will dull and the more likely the blade will suffer nicks. Hard surfaces like marble, metal, and china will do the most damage to a knife blade. At the other end or the spectrum is softwood, which is the most friendly surface for a knife blade. A softwood cutting surface, however, contains a multitude of safety problems. Cuts and nicks created during normal knife use can cause wood chips to mix with your food. Also, softwoods easily absorb and retain moisture. This creates a perfect environment for bacteria to take residence deep enough under the surface to make it impossible to sanitize. When this happens, it is just a matter of time before someone becomes a victim of food poisoning.\nIn my opinion, there are only two materials that, with proper care, will subject your knife blade to the least amount of damage and minimize the development of food-poisoning bacteria: Hardwood and molded white polyethylene plastic cutting boards have durable surfaces that can be sanitized effectively.\nUntil plastic cutting boards hit the market, hardwood was the favored cutting surface in most professional and home kitchens. Since plastic is more resistant to moisture absorption than wood, conventional wisdom held that plastic boards were more sanitary than hardwood boards and less likely to support the growth of bacteria. A recent study done by two microbiologists at the University of Wisconsin\u0092s Food Research Institute, however, indicate that the opposite is true. Their tests showed that a hardwood surface is an inhospitable environment for food-borne bacteria. In fact, bacteria contained in poultry and meat juices disappeared from wood surfaces within minutes of contact. On the other hand, the same contaminants multiplied on plastic boards within minutes.\nMy mom used two hardwood cutting boards. One was used for foods that were to be cooked and the other for foods that were to be eaten raw, like salads. These boards were stored in separate areas in the kitchen and were never on the counter at the same time. After each use these boards were washed in hot soapy water and sanitized with a mixture of 2 cups of warm water and 3 tablespoons of chlorine bleach. If the boards picked up an odor from strong smelling foods, the odor was removed by rubbing the board with a paste made of baking soda and water.\nAfter a period of use the surface of a plastic board becomes scarred from knife cuts. Bacteria can accumulate in these little nicks and resist all sanitizing efforts. When the hardwood board gets to this point, discard it and buy a new one. Well-maintained hardwood cutting boards are more resistant to staining and scaring because regular scrubbing helps the surface remain smooth and free from deep nicks.\nStove top utensils\nCooking on the stove top requires very specialized equipment. Sauce pots, skillets, stock pots, Dutch ovens, and saut\u00e9 pans are the most frequently used utensils when cooking on top of the stove. When we are cooking with these pots and pans, an educated cook expects two basic performance qualities: the surface must conduct heat evenly so that hot spots don\u0092t develop (as pans that are not able to heat evenly will quickly burn food), and the surface of pots and pans should be chemically unreactive so that they will not change the taste or edibility of food.\nUnfortunately, both of these qualities cannot be realized with any single material. Understanding how the materials that are used to make pots and pans will react during the cooking process will help you evaluate your present inventory of stove top utensils.\nUtensils used on the stove top are exposed to direct contact with heat, and they heat the food they contain through a process called conduction. The efficiency by which the utensil\u0092s material transfers heat determines how a pot or pan will perform.\nMetals are the most efficient direct contact heaters but are reactive with foods and can change their taste; ceramics are the least efficient but they are unreactive. Unfortunately, neither nature nor technology has been able to provide us with a single material that is an excellent conductor of heat, chemically unreactive to food, and affordable. This forces cooks to make informed compromises when buying stove top utensils.\nOther than expensive metals (like gold and silver) tin, copper, and aluminum are the best heat movers in town. Middle of the road conductors include cast iron and carbon steel\u0097which is used as a rolled sheet metal to fashion traditional woks and crepe pans. Stainless steel is the slowest and least efficient conductor of the metals.\nThe poorest conductors are glass, porcelain, earthenware, and pottery in general. A few years ago my mother gave me an enamelware pan. Enamelware was first introduced for use in the kitchen in the 19th century. It was made by fusing powdered glass onto the surface of cast iron. It was an early attempt to marry the nonreactive qualities of a porcelain material with the conductive efficiency of a metal. Stove top utensils made this way require careful handling. Quenching a hot enamelware pan in cold water will crack or shatter the coating. In my opinion this material is not suited for the extreme stress of kitchen use. My mom\u0092s gift makes a beautiful wall decoration in my kitchen.\nLet\u0092s take a brief look at the properties of the most popular metals used to make pots and pans.\nTin\nTin is one of the few metals that can be found naturally in its metallic state. It is both nonreactive and an excellent heat conductor. However, it has two troublesome properties that limit its role in the manufacture of stove top utensils: it is a relatively soft metal that wears easily, and it has the very low melting point of 450 degrees. Since tin is not cheap, making heavy-gauge pots and pans from it would also be very expensive. In addition, the often extreme temperatures experienced in stove top cooking, and the damaging effects of cleaning with abrasives, would literally wear the pot away in a short time.\nCopper\nCopper is also often mined in its natural metallic state. In the kitchen, its unmatched conductivity is its most attractive feature. It is also a very expensive metal for making heavy-gauge pots and pans. Copper has an oxide coating that is often powdery and porous, making it easy for copper ions to leach into foods. The human body has a very limited ability to excrete copper and ingestion of excessive amounts can cause gastrointestinal problems and possibly severe liver damage. If you are willing to pay the price, heavy-gauge copper pots are available with tin lining the inside surfaces. Eventually, due to the soft property of the tin, the pots and pans will have to be relined, a process that is nearly as expensive as their original price. One more problem with copper\npots is that they must be kept clean, shiny, and untarnished in order to maintain their superior conductivity. This is often a monumental task. Copper has a high affinity to oxygen, and sulfur forms a greenish coating when exposed to the polluted air that is so common in our world. If you own a set of copper pots and pans, be prepared to spend a great deal of time polishing.\nAluminum\nAluminum is the most abundant metal found in the earth\u0092s crust. This makes it an economical metal for making heavy-gauge cookware. It also has low density making it much lighter than other metals manufactured to the same thickness. The heat flow efficiency of a thick-gauge aluminum pan is almost the same as that of a copper pan of the same gauge. Non-coated aluminum, however, has a bad habit of reacting to certain foods. For instance, the hydrogen sulfide developed while cooking eggs will cause an unprotected aluminum surface to develop a variety of aluminum oxide and hydroxide complexes. These complexes show themselves as grey or black stains on the surface of the pan and will often cause light colored foods to become noticeably stained. The same staining will also develop when cooking with hard water or high-alkali foods such as potatoes. High acid foods, like tomato sauce, will remove some of this stain and change the color of the sauce.\nThe surface atoms of all these common metals, with the exception of iron, undergo a spontaneous reaction when exposed to atmospheric oxygen. They form a very stable protective oxide film. This oxide film is both tough and nonreactive. Unfortunately, as aluminum demonstrates, this film is extremely thin\u0097only a few molecules thick\u0097and can be easily scratched or worn away during the cooking process. Manufacturers of aluminum cookware have discovered a way to artificially create a thicker and more impervious version of this coating through a process called anodizing. Unlike electroplating, in which a metallic coating is applied to the surface of the metal, anodizing actually converts the surface of the existing metal making it an integral part of the aluminum and fairly impervious. You can purchase heavy-gauge anodized aluminum cookware, with or without an additional non-stick coating\u0097usually Teflon or Silverstone. However, it has been my experience that even the best of these nonstick coatings eventually wears away. Hard-anodized cookware, without a nonstick coating, can be seasoned in the same way as cast iron. This will, in my opinion, extend the usefulness of the pan while giving you all of the nonreactive and efficient heat conduction benefits of coated aluminum. I recently purchased a hard anodized, 3-quart sauce pan. It was more expensive than its nonanodized cousin, but well worth the money.\nCast iron\nCast iron is a poorer heat conductor than aluminum or copper, and because of its high density it is also heavier. Also, iron is the exception to the rule that metals form a protective coating when they oxidize. Instead, in the presence of air and moisture, iron forms an orange complex of ferric oxide and water which is a loose\npowder, not a film. This powder does not protect the metal and, unless cast iron is properly seasoned, it will corrode continuously. Cast iron cookware does, however, offer some substantial benefits. When compared to aluminum or copper it is fairly inexpensive. It is also a safe metal to cook with because the human body can readily eliminate excess iron. Finally, because iron is much denser than aluminum, it will absorb heat more slowly and hold it longer. This characteristic is what makes cast iron cook at such a steady rate. I own several pieces of cast iron cookware. They are, and will remain, my most cherished stove top utensils.\nStainless steel\nStainless steel is made by adding chromium and sometimes nickel to iron. This is done to improve the mechanical properties of the metal. In this steel alloy, oxygen reacts with the chromium atoms at the surface to form a protective coat so the iron never gets a chance to rust. Stainless steel has one major problem: it is a very inefficient conductor of heat. A stainless steel pan will often have hot spots, even when the bottom is plated with aluminum or copper in an effort to even out the heat transfer. Aluminum coatings will also warp and separate from the stainless steel if accidentally subjected to excessive heat because the two metals expand differently when heated. Heavy-gauge stainless steel cookware is also very expensive. My personal experience has convinced me that its overall poor performance does not justify the price.\nI hope this information will help you make the right choice if and when you decide to replace your existing stove top cookware. I will offer one last bit of advice: if your existing pots and pans are meeting all of your cooking needs, don\u0092t go looking for something better.\nOther kitchen wares\nBefore we move on to the recipe section, here are some quick tips on other handy pieces of kitchen equipment.\nRice cookers: If you have trouble cooking rice and keeping it hot for any length of time, a rice cooker is for you. These handy cookers have the ability of cooking up to four cups of raw rice and keeping the cooked rice at serving temperature for up to four hours. Some models even come with a nonstick lining to make cleanup a breeze.\nPepper mills: Nothing compares with the taste of fresh ground pepper. If you don\u0092t have a pepper mill, and you are still using preground pepper to cook with or season food at the table, it\u0092s time for you to stop cheating your taste buds and buy a good pepper mill. Preground pepper loses flavor quickly, often while it is still sitting on the store shelf. If you have any preground pepper on the shelf that is more than three months old, throw it away. Then go out and buy a good pepper mill, preferably one with a crank handle. They\u0092re easier to use. Using fresh ground pepper will add new life to all of your recipes, and its wonderful flavor will lessen the need for salt at the table.\nHere are two recipes my mom prepared when she was short on time, bored with other foods, or wanted to prepare a meal for later in the week and hold it in the refrigerator. A reality for her was the fact that she had to devote 40 hours or more of her week to a job. On her days off she would often prepare foods that she felt would hold in the refrigerator without deteriorating in texture or appearance. The holiday stew and meat pie casserole presented here are examples of this type of recipe. As unique and elegant as these \u0093time savers,\u0094 as she called them, were she never shared them with others. They were reserved for her and me to enjoy. She even kept the recipes in a separate file.\nMy three children, Sarah, Jason, and Michael, serve as my in-house recipe-review committee. They are assigned the task of approving all recipes that I share with you in these pages, and they are usually very open-minded when evaluating new foods. I was, however, a little apprehensive about how they would feel about these time-saver recipes. As it turned out they thought both were great. On the night that I served the spicy New England stew, Sarah commented, \u0093I wish I could take some of this to school when they serve that greasy, limp pizza for lunch.\u0094\nTry these two recipes in your kitchen. I am confident that you and your family will enjoy them.\nSpicy New England holiday stew\nNot being a real lover of turkey, my mom was always experimenting with different ways of preparing chicken, beef, and pork for the main meals on Thanksgiving and Christmas. On one occasion, knowing that she was scheduled to work on Christmas Day, she decided to prepare our holiday dinner the day before. She told me: \u0093We\u0092re going to celebrate the holiday with a very special Pennsylvania-style stew that your Aunt B. taught me to make. With the stew, we\u0092re going to have some fresh baked challah bread (see my article on Festive Breads Nov./Dec. 1996) and apple pie with ice cream for dessert.\u0094\nWho needs turkey with a meal like this?\nThe recipe contains ingredients that you don\u0092t usually associate with a stew, like cranberry sauce and horseradish. Fear not; these ingredients are well suited for this stew. Cranberry sauce is well known as a flavor enhancer, adding life to dull tasting foods like turkey. Here it combines its mild sweetness with the mellow, refined character of a young, fruity, dry red wine. It will add an exciting taste not common to most stews. The fierce, biting character of the horseradish is softened during the extended cooking process. The flavor that remains is mellow and nut-like. Both of these ingredients also act as thickening agents, adding a wonderful texture to the finished stew. The original recipe called for yellow turnip (rutabaga). I have substituted white turnip because its flavor is more mellow and predictable than that of yellow turnip. So if you\u0092re looking for a new taste that will make your flavor sensors sit up and take notice, give this stew a try.\nIngredients:\n4 lbs. stew beef, cut into one-inch pieces\nvegetable oil to brown the meat\n\u00bc cup onion, diced medium\n1 carrot, diced medium\n1 celery rib, diced medium\n1 14 oz. can diced tomatoes, with the liquid\n3 cups fresh or canned beef stock\n3 cups red Zinfandel or other good young red wine of your choice\n1 16 oz. can whole-berry cranberry sauce\n1 cup grated horseradish, drained\n1 cinnamon stick\n"}, {"score": 337.43558, "uuid": "eb952b18-cfbb-5d31-aa2b-39706eeebcc4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0717wb-17-01527", "target_hostname": "www.yummyfood.net", "target_uri": "http://www.yummyfood.net/ftopicp-286.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Knifes: the edge of reason - post 286 - Yummyfood", "snippet": "When it comes to materials, <em>ceramic</em>, carbon <em>steel</em> and stainless <em>steel</em> all have their aficionados.

Before <em>I</em> talk brands, let\u2019s talk about what one <em>should</em> look for in a knife.", "explanation": null, "document": "By Christopher Tanner\nMonday, May 2, 2011\nPeople often ask me what my favorite chef knife is and what criteria they should use in looking for a knife.\nAs a professional, some of us have that one trusty knife that we got at the beginning of our career and feel that is the only knife they will ever need. I, on the other hand, have probably owned at least five full-size chef knives in my career \u2014 until I decided on the one I use the most now.\nI actually keep two now, as I feel each has its own purpose. I could go into a whole list of knives for you, but that would make my already long posts quite a bit longer. So I will concentrate on just the regular chef knife.\nBefore I talk brands, let\u2019s talk about what one should look for in a knife. The first thing to consider is where you\u2019re going to be using this, at home or in a professional kitchen. Although there are some who want professional quality, it is not always necessary to pay $300 for a knife you are just going to use at home. Most people at home or professionals will want to seek out a hand-forged, high-carbon stainless steel blade which holds its sharpness quite well and is pretty durable.\nAnother option is high-carbon steel (not stainless) which is what many Japanese high-end knives are made out of. These knives are usually folded the way Japanese swords were once made for samurai. Many times the blade is so hard though, that if dropped or treated poorly (say, chopping bones), the blade can crack. If not dried after use and oiled, the blade may rust as well, so these knives take a professional hand.\nAnother material that has become slightly popular is ceramic. These share the same issues as the folded steel Japanese knives, but are even more fragile. They hold a sharp blade even longer.\nNext you will want to make sure that you get a proper handle. Plastic, rubber, stainless steel or treated wood are good. Non-treated wood is not as good, as it can absorb water and crack or mold. When looking at the handle, you want to make sure that the blade goes all the way through the handle, or as many call it, a \u201cfull tang.\u201d This is to balance the knife and give it durability. Blade size is important as well, and the only way you are going to figure out what you like for size is by putting a few knives in your hands and maybe even chopping something \u2014 if the store lets you. If a store doesn\u2019t let you hold the knife, they shouldn\u2019t get to hold your cash. I prefer a large 12-inch blade, as I have large hands. Others may prefer a 10-inch, 8-inch or 6-inch blade. Don\u2019t go smaller \u2014 those 5-inch blades are just to have a cute knife.\nThose of you at home will probably want to send out your knives to be sharpened by a local knife shop or culinary store. Make sure they use a whet stone or an oil stone, and that they do not grind their knives. Grinding will shorten the life of your knives, as it takes off a larger amount of metal with each sharpening. The best way, though, is to buy your own whet stone, have the store teach you how to use it. Then you know your knives are being cared for.\nHere\u2019s a list of knives I have run into and like for different reasons. As for pricing, these estimates are for their regular, no frills lines. Many of these companies offer funky handle designs and other frills; frankly, these are for aesthetics and to make more money off of you.\nWUSTHOF:\nThis is a German manufacturer and one of the most popular and best knives on the market. A 10-inch blade will run you about $100, depending on where you shop.\nHENCKELS:\nAnother popular knife, but for some reason, I don\u2019t like them as much. They just don\u2019t seem to hold a blade as long as the Wusthof, but they are usually about $5 to $10 cheaper. This is a German company as well.\nGLOBAL:\nA very popular trendy knife made in Japan. However, it is not the folded steel as many think \u2014 it is stainless steel. They hold a sharp blade pretty well, but the handle, which is metal, can be difficult to get used to. These run about $130 for a 10-inch blade.\nSABATIER:\nWell, the French do make a chef knife, and from what I\u2019ve seen, this is the only one I like. I used to use their slicer. It is a good quality knife that will run you about $80. I\u2019d say they are on par with Henckels.\nMAC:\nPretty popular knives in the professional kitchen set. They come in a variety of steels, but the stainless steel runs between $150 and $170 depending where you shop. This knife stays incredibly sharp and supposedly is well worth the price from what I have seen in tests.\nFURI:\nAlright, I\u2019m putting this one here because many people tell me they like these knives. They are made in Australia and everyone\u2019s darling Rachael Ray is there spokesperson, these are the knives you see here using on her show. I\u2019m guessing these aren\u2019t too popular in professional kitchens, and I\u2019m not too sure how I would react to seeing one in a professional kitchen. They seem to be pushing a professional line now though (without that god-awful orange handle) with metal handles which retail between $100 and $130 depending on where you look.\nKYOCERA:\nA good quality ceramic knife, stays incredibly. As noted before, it is fragile. I\u2019ve broken a few pairing knives from them and have since switched to my current knives. Six-inch is as high as they go, and it retails for about $90. Their top-of-the-line extra durable knife with extra long-lasting sharpness is $300.\nNENOX:\nMy last selection is the knife that I use. It is Japanese-made, which is made by the mentioned folding of the carbon-steel to make the blade super hard and makes it sharp as well. This blade is also super thin, which makes it not a good knife to use for chopping big items like bones and the sort (I use a Wusthof for those purposes). These are continuously rated the best knives on the market. I hate to admit this, but my chef knife cost me about $400 with a discount, meaning you\u2019ll probably pay about $450 for this knife at home. Most home cooks will never need a knife like this, and many chefs neither. This knife requires a lot of care, but this care will be rewarded by how amazing this knife is.\nI hope that helps a few people out with their knife choices. The same qualities go for any of the other types of knives made by these companies, but obviously the prices will be different. If there is anything I can do to help anyone in the choice of their knives in the future, please do not hesitate to contact me. I have sort of an obsession with kitchen knives.\nShare story:\n"}, {"score": 324.88635, "uuid": "138f6cb1-fc3c-5027-94d0-0034e31902bc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0206wb-22-13914", "target_hostname": "www.oneprojectcloser.com", "target_uri": "http://www.oneprojectcloser.com/how-to-level-a-plywood-or-osb-subfloor-using-asphalt-shingles-construction-felt/", "page_rank": 1.1801451e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "How to Level a Plywood <em>or</em> OSB Subfloor Using Asphalt Shingles &amp; Construction", "snippet": "The joists run from the front of the house to a <em>steel</em> <em>I</em>-beam in the middle of the house, and then from that <em>I</em>-beam to the back wall. Each span is approximately 14 feet.", "explanation": null, "document": "This article is part of our series on How to Install Hardwood Floors .\nWhile preparing to lay 1100 square feet of hardwood flooring, we discovered significant variation in the OSB subfloor that will serve as the nailing surface for the hardwoods. This article provides detailed instructions for leveling a subfloor based on our project.\nProject Overview: Uneven OSB Subfloor\nThe subfloor beneath our first floor is 5/8\u2033 oriented strand board (OSB) laid over 2 x 10 joists that are spaced 16 inches on-center (o.c.). The joists run from the front of the house to a steel I-beam in the middle of the house, and then from that I-beam to the back wall. Each span is approximately 14 feet.\nBefore we pulled up the previous flooring surfaces (carpet and vinyl), we knew there were some spots on the subfloor with significant peaks and valleys. \u00a0Our kitchen, for instance, had a noticeable dip around a cabinet\u00a0peninsula. \u00a0We think the house was built with \u2018green\u2019 lumber that may have been exposed to moisture before it was installed. When it dried, the bowing became very noticeable.\nAlso, every piece of dimensional lumber has a natural crown to it (the direction it bows along the long edge of the wood). The joists should have been laid such that all the wood was \u201ccrown up,\u201d but we suspect that several of the joists were\u00a0incorrectly\u00a0installed \u201ccrown down.\u201d When this happens between two joists that are \u201ccrown up,\u201d the depression can be significant.\nThe depth error in the worst spots on the floor was as much as 3/4\u2033 over about 4 feet. This is well outside the tolerance for hardwood flooring, which should be no more than 3/16\u2033 variation over 8 feet. You can see the dramatic slope on just one part of the floor in this picture. The level is sitting on the crown peaks, with the same measure in a depression between them.\nWhat is surprising about this floor is that the actual OSB is in very good shape. Sometimes, you\u2019ll find OSB swelling at the joists where moisture contacted the subfloor. This wasn\u2019t the case in this house. We did have to replace one piece of OSB due to wood rot where a persistent leak existed, but the rest of the floor was in pristine condition.\nIf you\u2019re dealing with a swelled OSB situation, we think the best course of action is to use a belt sander to grind down the swelled edge. Just make sure this doesn\u2019t cause any structural instability. If the piece is rotted or just beyond reasonable repair, the best course of action is replacement.\nThe Solution for Leveling a Subfloor\nSearching around the internet for solutions, we eventually landed on this article from Ask the Builder that suggests using construction felt and asphalt roofing shingles to level an uneven plywood or OSB floor for hardwood installation. This was a novel idea to us, but it made sense. \u00a0Both roofing shingles and construction felt are dense, not prone to compression (a key element for leveling), and sufficiently thin that they can be used as incremental steps to get to a flat surface.\nSince we have such dramatic slopes on the floor, we decided to use the shingles and construction felt solution along with a new layer of 3/8\u2033 plywood. We chose 3/8\u2033 plywood because it is rigid enough to absorb very minor depressions underneath it, and not so heavy as to be unwieldy.\nWe are planning to lay 3/4\u2033 exotic hardwoods on top of the plywood, so what we\u2019re looking for from the new plywood isn\u2019t an \u201cultra-rigid\u201d surface, it simply needs to bond to the layer beneath it, absorb very small gaps where the leveling provided by the construction felt and shingles isn\u2019t perfect, and allow sufficient \u201cgrab\u201d by subfloor screws to get a tight bond with the 5/8\u2033 OSB below.\nTo fasten the plywood to the OSB, we considered using a combination of 2\u2033 subfloor screws and construction adhesive (i.e., Liquid Nails for Subfloors). This is generally referred to as \u201cgluing and screwing,\u201d and you\u2019ll see it suggested on some ceramic tiling sites as a method to increase the rigidity of a floor for tile installation. Since we\u2019re going to be laying the 3/4\u2033 hardwoods on top, which itself will entail 15 gauge staples more or less every 18 inches on the floor, we decided to omit the construction adhesive and instead go just with the screws. Our primary motivation was speed and less mess, and so far after walking on the floor, we\u2019re happy with the result.\nFor the subfloor screws, we used a Senco Screwgun (reviewed at that link) to fasten the 3/8\u2033 plywood to the OSB. The screwgun is an absolute must for this job. We put a screw in approximately every one foot square, which means approximately 1100 screws on this floor. Driving with a drill-driver is simply not an efficient option.\nAlternatives to Shingles and Plywood for Leveling\nBefore getting into all the details of the leveling job, I should say there are other options for leveling a floor. For instance, we could have pulled up the OSB, shimmed the joists underneath, and refastened the OSB to the shimmed joists. This would have the advantage of not putting any additional load on the subfloor, and addressing the cause of the problem directly at the root.\nIn our situation, however, we believed that this effort would be much more significant than a new layer of 3/8\u2033 plywood, because the problem was pervasive throughout the floor in varying degrees, and as you\u2019ll see from the pictures below, the shingles give a lot of options for how to address a slope over a wide range of floor. \u00a0If we were dealing with a single, significant depression in one or two parts of the floor caused by joists being incorrectly crowned, we probably would have opted for this solution since it is much less expensive.\nThere\u2019s also self leveling concrete as an option for leveling a subfloor. We used self leveler to level the concrete slab in our basement with great success. We opted against this solution on the first floor because most self levelers aren\u2019t rated for installation over OSB, and because they are expensive and messy. Plus, we figured we would need to install 3/8\u2033 plywood over the self leveler to prepare for hardwoods (this may have been overkill, but we weren\u2019t comfortable with the solution of driving staples directly through the leveler). Effectively, the asphalt shingles in our solution are a rigid leveler that we think works as well as any liquid self leveler would have, and they are easier to control. \u00a0If you\u2019ve never worked with self leveler, it is a miracle product, but it has its drawbacks, including short work times.\nTools Required for Leveling a Floor with Plywood and Shingles\n8 foot level \u2013 for getting an idea of where the high and low spots are on the floor.\n4 foot level \u2013 for moving in tighter areas and judging how level a local area is.\nString and nails \u2013 for pulling a string above the floor both before and after the installation to get floor-wide perspective on the problem.\nUtility knife with roofing blade (2 knives are nice if you\u2019re working with two people).\nTape measure\nCircular saw (recommended) and/or table saw for cutting plywood.\nScrewgun (we like this Senco Screwgun with square head driving bit).\nMaterials Required for Leveling a Floor\nAsphalt roofing shingles \u2013 the 3-tab kind that are about 1/16\u2033 thick (cheapest available is best). You can find these at Home Depot, Lowes, roofing supply stores, and other home stores.\n3/8\u2033 plywood \u2013 this will be sold as 11/32\u2033 plywood. You will need a sufficient amount to cover the subfloor.\n2\u2033 or 2.5\u2033 collated subfloor screws for the screwgun \u2013 we used square-head screws \u2013 expect 1 screw per square foot.\n30 lb. construction felt.\nSteps for Leveling a Subfloor\nPreparation: Ensure the subfloor is clear, clean, and free of debris, with plenty of space to work. Remove molding and baseboard at the edges so you can get the plywood close to the walls.\nStep 1: Determine and mark high and low spots across the floor. We did this two ways, first by dragging our 8 foot level across the floor to try to determine where the high and low spots were in local areas, and then by stretching a string across the whole floor, secured by a nail on each end. \u00a0The string does a better job of showing high and low areas across the whole floor. We marked high and low spots using a non-scientific method, sharpie marker on the floor with the words \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d and sometimes \u201cvery low\u201d in the worst spots.\nStep 2: Set a strategy for filling in low spots to \u201ceven out\u201d the floor. The floor doesn\u2019t have to be level, it has to be flat. Also, it doesn\u2019t have to be perfectly flat \u2013 3/16\u2033 rise or fall over an 8-10 foot area is acceptable. \u00a0We decided to start at one end of the floor near the fireplace that had a significant low area and a nearby high area. Near the front of this fireplace, the depression is almost 3/4\u2033, so we\u2019ll have to stack the shingles over one another.\nStep 3: Fill in low spots with shingles and construction felt. For our efforts, we decided to use shingles exclusively under the 3/8\u2033 plywood, with the possibility of using the construction felt between the 3/8\u2033 plywood and the hardwoods if necessary. \u00a0This can be hard to get perfect, and we found ourselves frequently going back and forth between our 8 foot and 4 foot levels.\nIf you picture the floor as a topographical map, the idea is to try to fill in the low spots, which may require overlapping some shingles to get to the right depth, and will certainly require cuts\u2026 especially since you are always leveling in two dimensions. You can picture that if you were filling a perfectly round depression, you would probably start in the very middle and work your way out, layering shingles until you get a perfectly flat surface.\nStep 4: Once the low spots are filled in with shingles, fasten 3/8\u2033 plywood to the surface using 2\u2033 or 2.5\u2033 subfloor screws. Try to hit the joists as often as possible and put the screws about every 12-14\u2033 along the perimeter and about once every square foot in the field. In this picture, Ethan is checking to sure that the shingles underneath my feet are filling the gap in the floor correctly.\nWe found it best to \u201cdry fit\u201d the plywood in place first, walk on it and have another person use the level to check for uniform flatness. \u00a0Once you start putting screws in, you\u2019ll eventually create a very difficult sheet to remove (remember, each piece of plywood ends up with about 45 screws in it if you screw every 12 inches square and along the perimeter).\nStep 5: Continue moving out from the first piece of plywood, continually leveling and re-evaluating extended areas of the floor. It is a good idea to regularly check and re-check the height of the floor and to make sure that seams between the pieces of plywood do not create ridges. \u00a0Much like regular tongue-and-groove plywood on joists, we recommend staggering the joints on the long edge.\nStep 6: Repeat steps 3-5 throughout the rest of the floor.\nFloor Loading / Weight Considerations\nAny time you are adding weight to a floor, there can be a loading concern. \u00a0Most modern homes are built to handle 40 lbs. / square foot average loading, but every house is different, and your individual situation could be very different. \u00a03/8\u2033 plywood weighs about 1.5 lbs. / square foot, so we were not concerned about it. \u00a0Asphalt shingles can get heavy, however, especially when filling in a low spot. We think the most weight that would be placed across a single joist with the shingles is about 15-25 lbs along the span, or about 3-4 lbs. per square foot.\nIn general, plywood does not add strength to a floor, except that it can help distribute the load from the center of a floor to the edges and to nearby joists, which tends to increase strength a bit. If you are at all concerned, it is wise to consult with a structural engineer before trying this in your own home.\nAdditional Thoughts & Tips\nTry to avoid relying on the 3/8\u2033 plywood to level the floor. 3/8\u2033 plywood will span about a 1 inch gap before it exhibits considerable localized weakness\u2026 Instead, try to use the shingles and/or construction felt to eliminate air gaps between the true subfloor and the additional 3/8\u2033 plywood layer.\nRemember that the subfloor being \u201clevel\u201d is considerably less important than being \u201cflat\u201d \u2013 if there\u2019s a slight incline (3/16\u2033 or less) over 8 feet, that will likely be imperceptible to visitors and you especially once furniture is placed in the room.\nThink of the project as trying to \u201csmooth out\u201d hills and valleys in the floor to acceptable tolerances. Nothing has to be perfect.\nPlan to lay the hardwood floors across the joists rather than parallel to them. This will further reinforce an even flooring surface.\nDoes it Work?\nAbsolutely. Take a look at the finished floor in this space . It\u2019s beautiful, and almost perfectly flat. We\u2019ve had the floor installed for 1-1/2 years now and have had no problems with leveling. Guests marvel at the new floor, not knowing all the work that went into the installation.\nGood article? Give us a +1.

Do you sell tools outside the United States?", "explanation": null, "document": "What kind of steel do we use for our knives? Why? How does this steel compare to other steel types?\nCrater series: 420HC\nUS made, from Crucible Metals. 420HC is used because it has good edge retention (stays sharp), toughness (it's not brittle), and is corrosion resistant.\nExpanse series: 154CM\nUS made from Crucible Metals. 154CM is used because it has even better edge retention, toughness and corrosion resistance than 420. We have used our CATRA edge retention test equipment to compare 154CM to 420, and the 154CM holds an edge approximately 3-times longer.\nRockwell hardness by steel type:\n420HC: 55-59\nS30V: 58-60\nOther blade steels:\n440C is commonly used for knives and has gotten somewhat of a bad name for its ubiquity. ATS-34 is another common high-end steel; it is basically the Japanese version of 154CM. S60V is another premium steel with superior edge retention.\nWhat styles of blades do we offer?\nThe Crater and Expanse series 33-models, and Expanse 55-models all have drop-point style blades. We chose these because of how well they fit/fold into the handle of the knife. It's actually the stronger of the two styles.\nThe Crater series 55-model has a Clip-Point style blade.\nWe chose because people who like larger knives more often than not prefer a clip-point blade - better for field dressing.\nWhat are the blade angles of our knives?\nThe main bevel grind (the overall angle that defines the knife) varies slightly depending on the product but is close to nine degrees. The actual cutting edge grind for all plain-edge knife blades is 32 degrees. This is the same angle used on all our plain-edge blades - Crater and Expanse series and our multi-tools. The serration angle on the Crater and Expanse combo knives is 16 degrees. Our other serrated blades fall within the same range with slight variances depending on the product.\nWhat materials (and percentage of each) are our knife handles made from? Why did we choose these materials?\nWith the entire Crater series 100% of the handle is 60% long-glass fiber nylon. This material was chosen because of its strength. It was also chosen for its weight and resistance to chemicals such as DEET in bug spray, gas, or break cleaner, engine degreaser, ammonia, rubbing alcohol, etc.\nWith the entire Expanse series 80% of the handle is 60% long-glass fiber nylon (see Crater series for reason). 20% of the handle is 301 stainless steel cladding, this was chosen for it durability and thermal stability. It was tested and withstood temperatures up to +145F/+63C and down to -5F/20C.\nWhat process does each style of steel go through to make a knife blade?\n420HC blades: Crater series\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Fineblank - precision stamping process\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Flat finish - takes off initial burs from the stamping process\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Heat treat - this is a Quench Bath heat treat\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Mass finish - round over the sharp edges\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Double disc grind - makes the blades very flat at a precise thickness\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Lock taper grind - precision grinding of the KB lock face (only on c3/e3)\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Hollow grind - grind the main bevels and false edges\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Bead blast - creates matte surface finish\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Sharpen\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Laser cut - 154CM is too hard to blank, so it must be laser cut\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Heat treat - this is a Cryogenic heat treat\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Mass finish - round over the sharp edges\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Machining - precision hole drilling and counter sinking operation\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Double disc grind - makes the blades very flat at a precise thickness\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Lock taper grind - precision grinding of the KB lock face (only on c3/e3)\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Sharpen\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0Buff\nWhat are the benefits of lockback vs. liner lock and vice versa?\nLiner locks (Crater and Expanse 33-models) are quicker and easier to open, unlock, and close with one hand.\nThe lockback system (Crater and Expanse 55-models) is generally stronger than the liner lock system, and is considered more traditional since it has been around for so long. It typically takes two hands and when working with a larger blade in the case of the models Leatherman uses the lock back system on, this is an added safety measure.\nWhat finishing process do the blades have?\nThe Crater series has a bead blast finish.\nThe Expanse series has a scotchbrite/bead blast finish.\nWhat does Leatherman recommend for sharpening knives?\nAll of our knives can be re-sharpened using the standard methods. Sharpening stones work well and give a nice edge, but it takes more skill. You can also use diamond files. Those are quicker, but because they take metal off more quickly you have to be careful. Ceramic file systems are also good.\nWhen sharpening with any system, the included angle should be around 32 degrees. One sharpening set we often recommend is the Spyderco Tri-Angle Sharpmaker set. It's easy to use and effective, and can also be used for serrated blades.\nPlease describe the types of uses appropriate for our knives; i.e., were they designed with specific activities in mind?\nCrater and Expanse series 33-models were designed as durable utility blades for every day use and carry. The styling and innovative features are aimed at young, active people who enjoy spending time outdoors.\n\u2022\u00a0They have a technical look\n\u2022\u00a0The blade launcher\u00ae is a cool innovative feature\n\u2022\u00a0The carabiner makes the knife easy to attach to and use with outdoor gear (back packs, hydration systems, etc)\n\u2022\u00a0The carabiner doubles as a bottle opener\n\u2022\u00a0The in-handle bit storage system allows for added versatility without having to carry a sheath\nThe Crater and Expanse series 55-models were designed for more durable applications, but can be used for everyday use for those who prefer larger knives. The styling was aimed at adding a somewhat modern look to the traditional lockback knife often used by hunters and other similar outdoor enthusiasts.\n\u2022\u00a0They are reminiscent of traditional lockback knives with a technical touch\n\u2022\u00a0The hefty blades make the knife feel substantial\n\u2022\u00a0The carabiner makes the knife easy to attach to and use with outdoor gear (back packs, hydration systems, etc)\n\u2022\u00a0The carabiner doubles as a bottle openerThe in-handle bit storage system allows added versatility without having to carry a bit sheath with you\nWhat are the grinding styles of our knife blades?\nCrater series knives have a hollow grind. This is actually a \"premium\" grind found on high-end kitchen cutlery. It creates a natural release when cutting so materials don't stick to the knife. This grind is done on a CNC machine.\nExpanse series knives have a flat grind. We use a flat grind on the harder steel so we don't go through as many CNC machine wheels hollow grinding. This is a cost measure.\nTRACKING CAT: , TRACKING ID:\n"}, {"score": 318.2772, "uuid": "74d9c66d-0ff2-57d3-8f38-8eec46ba7472", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0013wb-73-03990", "target_hostname": "www.catra.org", "target_uri": "http://www.catra.org/pages/faq/faq.htm", "page_rank": 2.1647522e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "snippet": "Q2 : <em>I</em> would like to <em>buy</em> some good quality table <em>knives</em> and forks, is there any way <em>I</em> can assess the overall quality for my self?

Is there something wrong with it?\nNo, silver is a relatively soft metal and is very easily marked by knives, ceramic and glassware. The myriad of scratches eventually builds up to form the classic patina associated with silver.\nQ2 : I would like to buy some good quality table knives and forks, is there any way I can assess the overall quality for my self?\nThe best option is to look for a design that suits your personal taste but carries a reference that it complies to the following quality standards or norms. ISO8442-2 is the International quality standard for table cutlery and can be prefixed by any of the following letters depending where it is made or being sold. BS for UK, DIN for Germany, FR for France and EN for anywhere in Europe. This specification is for metallic handle table cutlery and flatware only, if you want to buy some with non-metal handles such as glass, plastic, ceramic, bone or wood then the only specification available is the British Standard BS5577.1999.\nQ3 : My new stainless steel cutlery has developed a rainbow type stain all over it, should I send it back to the manufacturer and complain?\nNo, this colouration is known as detergent staining and develops both with hand and machine washing. It occurs when the items are not adequately rinsed in clean water and the residues of detergent gradually dry hard on to the surface creating an iridescent film. This can easily be removed with a mild stainless steel cleaner and some gentle rubbing.\nQ4 : The surface of our silver plated table cutlery has become stained with black/brown/blue discolouration, what is it and what can we do about it?\nThis is the normal tarnishing of silver, it is usually the discolouration associated with silver sulphide, which has been formed by the reaction of the silver with sulphur in the atmosphere or in food such as eggs and green leaf type vegetables. Unfortunately this phenomenon is a fact of life where silver is concerned and the only solution is to clean the items regularly. See CATRA Care of Cutlery leaflet.\nQ5 : We have recently started to use a dishwashing machine and have noticed that some of our knife blades are showing small dark holes or pits in the blades is this to be expected with the dishwasher?\nNo, however the problem is quite common. Sometimes it is caused by poor quality of manufacturing control in the way the blade is heat treated and ground during manufacture, (manufacturers contact CATRA for advice or users contact the manufacturer) or the general damp and corrosive environment inside the dishwasher often when the items are stored inside the unit for a long time without washing. The best advice we can offer here is to not store cutlery and flatware in a dishwasher for a long period prior to washing and to remove the items immediately the cycle is over. The pits are areas of corrosion (rust), which forms in this unusual way on stainless steels. Once this has occurred the pits will gradually grow in size as further dishwashing is carried out, but generally remain dormant when the items are dry and clean.\nQ6 : Our expensive new table cutlery is leaving black marks on the surfaces of our equally expensive ceramic plates and bowls, am I doing something wrong?\nNo, unfortunately certain types of ceramic surface glazes and particular types of stainless steel don't go well together. Very course glazes often abrade 18/8 grades of stainless cutlery items to leave thin deposits of metal as a black mark on the surface of the crockery and scratches on the cutlery. Today manufacturers and retailers of both cutlery and crockery are working hard to ensure this problem does not arise with new products, but many ceramic glazes are out there in our homes, which are just not ideal for use with certain cutlery items.\nQ7 : Can I remove them?\nYes, the easy solution is to rub the effected area with vinegar, this usually is successful.\nQ8 : I have inherited this old piece of table cutlery; can CATRA value it or give me some history?\nWe are sorry but CATRA does not have the historical expertise to answer this type of enquiry.\nQ9 : Some cutlery and flatware is marked 18/8 and some 18/10, is there any difference and what does it mean?\nThese numbers refer to the additional elements that are in the stainless steel. The first number is the chromium content and the second that of nickel. Both elements increase the corrosion (rust) resistance of the steel. So in theory the steel with 18 % chromium and 10% nickel has a better corrosion then the one with only 8% nickel. However many specifications for stainless steels around the world have a manufacturers composition tolerance within this grade of 8% to 10% nickel, so often although the item is marked 18/10 it may legally only have, for example 8.1% nickel. So in practical terms there may be no difference in performance.\nQ10 : Is it safe to dishwash all cutlery?\nNo. Care must be taken. It is okay if the manufacturers advice is that it will be safe, but if they do not advice it, don't do it. Dishwashers can effect cutlery in the following ways:\nBlade Corrosion-rusty stains, which can be removed with mild abrasives cleaners such as \"CIF\". Dark pits or holes which are unfortunately permanent. Handle discoloration - particularly if the handles are made from wood, plastics or bone.Surface discoloration in the form of rainbow or white stains is due to detergent drying on the items and is usually a sign of a faulty rinse operation within the dishwasher. See Care of Cutlery leaflet.\nKNIFE and BLADE SHARPENING TECHNOLOGY\nQ11 : Why do CATRA recommend the use of Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) for powered sharpening wheel abrasive when many other people use Diamond?\nDiamond is one of the hardness substances known to man and CBN comes very close behind it, so the obvious choice would be diamond. But most knives are made from steel (either stainless or alloy steels), which contain a certain amount of carbon. Now as our school science told us diamond is in fact a carbon crystal, which when grinding along the surface of steel reacts with the carbon atoms within it and causing premature wear. Therefore in a practical sense CBN lasts much longer than diamond. Manufacturers of sharpening systems that use diamond either don't know this fact, or would rather you bought more sharpening wheels because they wear out faster, or they believe the marketing sexiness of diamond sells more products. However as CATRA is the worlds leading sharp edge technology centre we believe in using the best and most efficient material for the process.\nQ12 : When the device is not powered can you use diamond then in such things as sharpening steels?\nYes, the above mentioned effect is most noticeable at high speed and power and so in the case of sharpening steels and proprietary sharpeners operated by hand, diamond is OK. We at CATRA do use diamond on the low powered CATRAHONE knife sharpener.\nQ13 : What is the correct sharpening angle for my knife edge?\nThe answer to this is not simple; it depends on the type of knife, its particular use and your facilities/ abilities to resharpen. However through many years of Research and Development CATRA recommends these following included edge angles as the best compromise between sharpness and edge life.\nType of knife and its use\nIncluded edge angle in \u00b0\n"}, {"score": 318.17273, "uuid": "ee4421aa-fe13-509d-a9f5-e954952826f1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0101wb-23-08754", "target_hostname": "www.catra.org", "target_uri": "http://www.catra.org///pages/faq/faq.htm", "page_rank": 2.0235267e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "snippet": "Q2 : <em>I</em> would like to <em>buy</em> some good quality table <em>knives</em> and forks, is there any way <em>I</em> can assess the overall quality for my self?

Is there something wrong with it?\nNo, silver is a relatively soft metal and is very easily marked by knives, ceramic and glassware. The myriad of scratches eventually builds up to form the classic patina associated with silver.\nQ2 : I would like to buy some good quality table knives and forks, is there any way I can assess the overall quality for my self?\nThe best option is to look for a design that suits your personal taste but carries a reference that it complies to the following quality standards or norms. ISO8442-2 is the International quality standard for table cutlery and can be prefixed by any of the following letters depending where it is made or being sold. BS for UK, DIN for Germany, FR for France and EN for anywhere in Europe. This specification is for metallic handle table cutlery and flatware only, if you want to buy some with non-metal handles such as glass, plastic, ceramic, bone or wood then the only specification available is the British Standard BS5577.1999.\nQ3 : My new stainless steel cutlery has developed a rainbow type stain all over it, should I send it back to the manufacturer and complain?\nNo, this colouration is known as detergent staining and develops both with hand and machine washing. It occurs when the items are not adequately rinsed in clean water and the residues of detergent gradually dry hard on to the surface creating an iridescent film. This can easily be removed with a mild stainless steel cleaner and some gentle rubbing.\nQ4 : The surface of our silver plated table cutlery has become stained with black/brown/blue discolouration, what is it and what can we do about it?\nThis is the normal tarnishing of silver, it is usually the discolouration associated with silver sulphide, which has been formed by the reaction of the silver with sulphur in the atmosphere or in food such as eggs and green leaf type vegetables. Unfortunately this phenomenon is a fact of life where silver is concerned and the only solution is to clean the items regularly.

Some of our handles also incorporate Zytel\u00ae and/or anodized aluminum.\nWhat kind of steel do you use?\nLeatherman tools are made of 400-series stainless steel. Carbon content and heat-treated hardness vary depending on the specific implement. In some of our premium tools and knives we use 154CM and S30V for the knife blades. These two grades will keep their edge three and six-times as long as 400-series steel, but are a little bit harder to put an edge back on when they do go dull.\nIf it is made of stainless steel, why do I have rust spots on my tool?\nNo stainless steel is truly stainless. It\u2019s just that: It stains less. It would be wise to think of it as corrosion-resisting steel. Corrosion can occur in the absence of proper maintenance, particularly in extreme conditions. Please visit our Maintenance Tips section for hints on keeping your Leatherman Tool looking good and functioning well.\nWhy do you hard-anodize your aluminum and what is the difference between type-II and type-III?\nAnodizing is an electrolytic-passivation process used to increase the thickness of the natural oxide layer on the surface of metal parts. We hard-anodize our aluminum to make it stronger and more corrosion resistant. By definition, type-III is \"hard\" anodizing. Type-II is an anodizing process as well, but it is not as thick and most commonly used for adding color to aluminum. The thickness of a type-III hard-anodized coating is about 2 to 4 times that of normal type-II anodizing.\nWhat materials do you use for the knives in your multi-tools?\nWe use 420HC stainless steel for all our multi-tool knives, save the Charge AL and ALX, Skeletool CX and Freestyel CX models. In these models we use 154CM. This steel holds its edge about three times as long as regular stainless steel and is perfect for people who use the blade on their tool more than the rest of the features. In the Charge TTi we use S30V\u00ae stainless steel for the knife, which holds its edge six-times as long as regular stainless steel.\nWhat extra steps do you take in your design and production process to really make Leatherman multi-tools stand apart?\nThere are quite a few things we do, but we roll them all into one phrase we call \"The Leatherman Difference\". Here is a list of some of the main things that make Leatherman multi-tools stand apart from others:\nFeature-Dense\nThere are no gaps in our tools. We fill every bit of space with useful implements.\nBecause we fill the entire length of the tool, our blades, files, and saws are the largest on the market for multi-tools.\nHeat Treated\nEach implement/feature is treated for its individual purpose. For example, knives are treated at a much higher temperature for excellent edge retention and handles are treated at lower temperatures for more flexibility.\nHandles, Wire Cutters, and Screwdrivers\nOur handles are comfort-sculpted so there's no hand fatigue.\nOur wire cutters are ground so precisely that they have to cut paper before they are cleared to go to assembly. Not only that, but they can cut paper after they cut a 16-penny nail\u2014multiple times.\nBit driver technology means you can switch out screwdriver tips for different projects. Depending on the tool or if you get the Bit Kit accessory, you'll can get up to 42 different types of bits you can conveniently store in the sheath.\nOur \u201cfixed\u201d screwdrivers are not just punched out, but ground on three sides so they hold a screw head better than the competition.\nFiles, Saws, and Knives\nDiamond-coated and wood/metal file surfaces run to the very edge and along the sides of the blade. This means more filing surface to get the job done faster.\nOur saws are cut in an \"open\" pattern design to resist filling up in wet or sappy conditions. They are also designed to work on the \"pull\" rather than the \"push\" so they don't flex (break) and take much less effort to use.\nOur knives are hollow-ground, sharpened to perfection and hold their edge longer than most on the market.\nOutside-accessible blades, files, and saws mean you don't have to open the tool to get to the most used feature - the knife - and you can open them with one hand.\nWhat are some of the other materials you use?\nWe use 6061-T6, type-III, hard-anodized aluminum for our Charge AL an ALX handle scales and for the handle insert on the Skeletool. It reduces weight, but is just as durable as stainless steel. We use type-II, anodized aluminum for the colored handle scales on the Juice and Squirt and Style tools. We use Titanium handle scales on the Charge TTi for added resistance to saltwater corrosion as well as weight and because the TTi is our premium tool.\nFor the Blast, Fuse and Kick models we use Zytel\u00ae inserts in the handles for comfort. Zytel\u00ae is very lightweight and incredibly durable. By adding it to the handles we can increase comfort, take off weight, and we won't loose any durability of stainless steel that would otherwise be used in the area.\nOn the Skeletool CX and Freestyle CX models we use Tungsten Diamond-like Coating (DLC) for scratch resistance and a carbon-fiber handle inserts to reduce weight.\nOn the MUT and MUT EOD, we use bronze for the carbon scraper. Bronze is softer than the steel used on firearms, so when you\u2019re scraping carbon from your gun you won\u2019t scar your parts.\nWe also use 154CM stainless steel for our replaceable wire and strap cutters. 154CM means the cutting surface will keep an edge about three-times as long as regular stainless steel, which is helpful in hard-to-sharpen, but frequently-used features.\nKnives\nWhat kind of steel do we use for our knives? Why? How does this steel compare to other steel types?\nCrater series: 420HC\nUS made, from Crucible Metals. 420HC is used because it has good edge retention (stays sharp), toughness (it's not brittle), and is corrosion resistant.\nExpanse series: 154CM\nUS made from Crucible Metals. 154CM is used because it has even better edge retention, toughness and corrosion resistance than 420. We have used our CATRA edge retention test equipment to compare 154CM to 420, and the 154CM holds an edge approximately 3-times longer.\nRockwell hardness by steel type:\n420HC: 55-59\nS30V: 58-60\nOther blade steels:\n440C is commonly used for knives and has gotten somewhat of a bad name for its ubiquity. ATS-34 is another common high-end steel; it is basically the Japanese version of 154CM. S60V is another premium steel with superior edge retention.\nWhat styles of blades do we offer?\nThe Crater and Expanse series 33-models, and Expanse 55-models all have drop-point style blades. We chose these because of how well they fit/fold into the handle of the knife. It's actually the stronger of the two styles.\nThe Crater series 55-model has a Clip-Point style blade.\nWe chose because people who like larger knives more often than not prefer a clip-point blade - better for field dressing.\nWhat are the blade angles of our knives?\nThe main bevel grind (the overall angle that defines the knife) varies slightly depending on the product but is close to nine degrees. The actual cutting edge grind for all plain-edge knife blades is 32 degrees. This is the same angle used on all our plain-edge blades - Crater and Expanse series and our multi-tools. The serration angle on the Crater and Expanse combo knives is 16 degrees. Our other serrated blades fall within the same range with slight variances depending on the product.\nWhat materials (and percentage of each) are our knife handles made from? Why did we choose these materials?\nWith the entire Crater series 100% of the handle is 60% long-glass fiber nylon. This material was chosen because of its strength. It was also chosen for its weight and resistance to chemicals such as DEET in bug spray, gas, or break cleaner, engine degreaser, ammonia, rubbing alcohol, etc.\nWith the entire Expanse series 80% of the handle is 60% long-glass fiber nylon (see Crater series for reason). 20% of the handle is 301 stainless steel cladding, this was chosen for it durability and thermal stability. It was tested and withstood temperatures up to +145F/+63C and down to -5F/20C.\nWhat process does each style of steel go through to make a knife blade?\n420HC blades: Crater series\nFlat finish - takes off initial burs from the stamping process\nHeat treat - this is a Quench Bath heat treat\nMass finish - round over the sharp edges\nDouble disc grind - makes the blades very flat at a precise thickness\nLock taper grind - precision grinding of the KB lock face (only on c3/e3)\nHollow grind - grind the main bevels and false edges\nBead blast - creates matte surface finish\nSharpen\nLaser cut - 154CM is too hard to blank, so it must be laser cut\nHeat treat - this is a Cryogenic heat treat\nMass finish - round over the sharp edges\nMachining - precision hole drilling and counter sinking operation\nDouble disc grind - makes the blades very flat at a precise thickness\nLock taper grind - precision grinding of the KB lock face (only on c3/e3)\nSharpen\nBuff\nWhat are the benefits of lockback vs. liner lock and vice versa?\nLiner locks (Crater and Expanse 33-models) are quicker and easier to open, unlock, and close with one hand.\nThe lockback system (Crater and Expanse 55-models) is generally stronger than the liner lock system, and is considered more traditional since it has been around for so long. It typically takes two hands and when working with a larger blade in the case of the models Leatherman uses the lock back system on, this is an added safety measure.\nWhat finishing process do the blades have?\nThe Crater series has a bead blast finish.\nThe Expanse series has a scotchbrite/bead blast finish.\nWhat does Leatherman recommend for sharpening knives?\nAll of our knives can be re-sharpened using the standard methods. Sharpening stones work well and give a nice edge, but it takes more skill. You can also use diamond files. Those are quicker, but because they take metal off more quickly you have to be careful. Ceramic file systems are also good.\nWhen sharpening with any system, the included angle should be around 32 degrees. One sharpening set we often recommend is the Spyderco Tri-Angle Sharpmaker set. It's easy to use and effective, and can also be used for serrated blades.\nPlease describe the types of uses appropriate for our knives; i.e., were they designed with specific activities in mind?\nCrater and Expanse series 33-models were designed as durable utility blades for every day use and carry. The styling and innovative features are aimed at young, active people who enjoy spending time outdoors.\nThey have a technical look\nThe blade launcher\u00ae is a cool innovative feature\nThe carabiner makes the knife easy to attach to and use with outdoor gear (back packs, hydration systems, etc)\nThe carabiner doubles as a bottle opener\nThe in-handle bit storage system allows for added versatility without having to carry a sheath\nThe Crater and Expanse series 55-models were designed for more durable applications, but can be used for everyday use for those who prefer larger knives. The styling was aimed at adding a somewhat modern look to the traditional lockback knife often used by hunters and other similar outdoor enthusiasts.\nThey are reminiscent of traditional lockback knives with a technical touch\nThe hefty blades make the knife feel substantial\nThe carabiner makes the knife easy to attach to and use with outdoor gear (back packs, hydration systems, etc)\nThe carabiner doubles as a bottle openerThe in-handle bit storage system allows added versatility without having to carry a bit sheath with you\nWhat are the grinding styles of our knife blades?\nCrater series knives have a hollow grind. This is actually a \"premium\" grind found on high-end kitchen cutlery. It creates a natural release when cutting so materials don't stick to the knife. This grind is done on a CNC machine.\nExpanse series knives have a flat grind. We use a flat grind on the harder steel so we don't go through as many CNC machine wheels hollow grinding. This is a cost measure.\nGeneral\nCan I get on a commercial aircraft carrying my Leatherman tool?\nNo at this time you cannot pass through the security checkpoint with a Leatherman tool. You may however, stow it in your checked luggage that travels under the plane. We do make one model, the Knifeless Fuse that follows all the TSA specifications, for a carry-on multi-tool, but remember\u2026Ultimately it is up to the discretion of the individual TSA agent as to what they will let you carry or not. For the latest federal regulations, please visit www.tsa.gov .\nWhere does the Leatherman name come from?\nOur tools bear the name of company president Tim Leatherman, who invented the original Pocket Survival Tool, now known as the PST.\nWhy should I buy a Leatherman tool?\nTim Leatherman's standards for quality, durability, precision and attention to detail are what make Leatherman tools like no other. Ever since Tim invented the category, we've focused on just one thing - manufacturing the world's highest quality multipurpose tools.\nHow does the Leatherman warranty work?\nOur warranty is simple. You broke it, we\u2019ll fix it. No questions, no hassles, no wasting your time. Just go to the \u201cWarranty\u201d page on www.leatherman.com and print/fill out the form provided there, put it and your tool (NO SHEATH PLEASE) in the mail to us and we\u2019ll fix/replace your tool and send it back to you for free.

They act as the warranty agent for Leatherman in that country. You can also find warranty information on the Leatherman Mobile Site, \u201cWarranty\u201d button, but the form cannot be downloaded from there.\nI can't live without my Leatherman for even a day. Can you just send me the parts I need?\nOur products are designed to be disassembled by factory-trained technicians only. Repaired tools are reassembled (and the pivot posts cemented) to ensure proper tension for optimum tool performance. Attempting to disassemble a Leatherman tool yourself may result in lost components and compromised tool functionality. It may also void your warranty protection.\nCan I have a different blade installed in my Leatherman tool?\nEach Leatherman tool consists of a combination of features that makes it a unique multi-purpose tool. We cannot alter or substitute different blade components from one tool version to another.\nMy son/wife/girlfriend/brother-in-law/boss accidentally locked open all the blades in one handle of my Super Tool. How can I get them unlocked?\nUse a separate screwdriver or similar device to unlock the blades. With the handles closed together, insert the screwdriver into the slot created by the handle spring (where the handle locks onto the tool blades). Gently pry up the handle spring until one of the blades can be released.\nI\u2019m from outside North America and I want to buy a Leatherman tool. Do you sell tools outside the United States?\nOur products are sold in approximately 90 countries around the world.

I had many requests from my professional Japanese chef customers across North America who buy stones for me to start importing these without bases. The argument is that when put down on a dampened cloth (to prevent slipping) it can actually be more stable than any stand (the stands have feet, so there is less contact with the surface it rests on). But please note that the base did provide some protection, so remember treat your stones gently and to avoid dropping or knocking them! Some people like the stands, some don't... it appears to be personal preference.\nThis fine stone is just the ticket for finishing off your edge, or for regular maintenance. It's a good option for people who don't need the more polished edge of the 5000 grit (and this one will work more quickly, and it's cheaper). This is the smoothest most people will ever need to use for most average knives, especially German (Henckels, Wusthof, Victorinox, Sanelli, etc.) knives or any knife with standard steel. This can also yield an edge that has a nice bite and which can be maintained nicely with a standard sharpening/honing steel.\nI searched for YEARS to find stones like this. Most I found were either poor quality (bad finish, not flat & smooth) or WAY too expensive (come on, it's a sharpening STONE, not precious metal!). These are high-end stones (near the very top of the many lines Naniwa makes), individually boxed (nice boxes -- they make nice gifts!), and bonded to high quality plastic bases with non-slip rubber feet. I also spent a little extra money on these to get them a full 2cm (nearly an inch) thick, since many of the cheaper stones you'll find people importing are just 1cm thick and so can wear down after a few years of use, or worse, can crack more easily since there's just not enough strength in the thin material. The ceramic compounds used to manufacture these is also of very high quality, and so they strike a great balance between ability to cut a nice edge without too much work and still being very long-lasting and strong. These are truly excellent sharpening stones, suitable for any serious hobbyist, pro, chef, wood-worker or outdoorsman. Note the nice large size too -- most other cheaper stones you'll see around shops or mail order in North America are smaller and so are more difficult to work with (and will wear out more quickly), especially with kitchen knives where it's nice to have the extra surface area when sharpening a santoku or chef's knife. Made in Japan.\nThese stones are made by the Resin Bond method, which yields a higher quality stone than the old baked method used with cheaper stones, and it offers 90% of the performance of the MUCH more expensive and fragile Magnesia method stones. Also, a great benefit of this method is that the stones do NOT require soaking in water prior to use (in fact they should NOT be soaked). A quick spray or splash of water is all that is needed and you're ready to go.\nClick here for a multi-lingual brochure (scroll down for English) by Naniwa explaining the use of a Japanese whetstone.\n30%\n"}, {"score": 294.9897, "uuid": "694d02f2-d186-5c9d-b0ce-90aaef891bba", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1809wb-08-20086", "target_hostname": "thekeenancookbook.com", "target_uri": "http://thekeenancookbook.com/dinner/homemade-sourdough-pizza-a-giveaway", "page_rank": 1.2502135e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "Homemade Sourdough Pizza &amp; A Giveaway", "snippet": "<em>I</em> received my knife in the mail and carefully read the instructions that came with it.

Since I\u2019m a kitchen geek and I love all sorts of gadgets, appliances, pans, and knives, I figured why not!\nI received my knife in the mail and carefully\u00a0read the instructions that came with it. Unlike steel blades, a ceramic knife is much more fragile \u2013 obviously. Instructions warn against dropping the knife on hard surfaces, or cutting on china or ceramic plates. And being ceramic, you need to be careful about using force. You can\u2019t twist the knife or use it to pry, and you shouldn\u2019t cut hard or frozen foods.\nSo understanding all of that and being careful with it, I set about using it.\nI found the\u00a0blade to be incredibly sharp, cutting effortlessly through a variety of fruits and vegetables. It\u2019s also now my favorite knife to trim meat with, and I\u2019ve gone to it a couple times already for cleaning up pork butt or chicken breasts. As far as knives go, this one is a great all purpose knife. \u00a0Treat it with the respect it deserves and you won\u2019 t be disapointed!\nI\u2019ve only had it a few weeks, so can\u2019t talk to its longevity, but currently I\u2019m quite happy with it. And I hope you\u2019ll enter the giveaway so you get the chance to try this ceramic knife out too.\nOne lucky reader will receive a Shenzhen 6\u2033 Ceramic Chef\u2019s Knife.

When it says \"fast and easy to use\" - you can believe it, but I must stress that reading the manual before using it is of utmost importance, to know to proceed and which stage is best for each task. We tested many types of steel kitchen and sporting knives with fine edges and serrated, including bread, Santoku, fillet, Chef's, paring, utility, slicing, steak and boning.\nThe stage used for each knife depended on whether it needed a touch-up (steeled) or a re-shaping of the edge. For example, when using stage 1, a burr must be formed before moving to the next stage. See page 6 & 7 of the manual, for an explanation of 'burr'. The manual explains the use of each stage, so I won't elaborate too much on the staging process. Pulling a knife through a stage is easy and requires little effort, but being consistent (no stops) is important and there's a short learning curve. Not all knives required all three stages; it depended entirely on the condition of the edge. Of the knives sharpened, some were older and had not been sharpened in years, others had been steeled regularly and a few were untouched.\nAs for performance, we were very satisfied with sharpening results and in some cases, knife edges were restored beyond our expectations, especially some of the older knives. The sharpening effort for each knife was similar, though some required more pulls than others, especially the thicker jack (lock-blade) knives.\nOverall Impression\nPerformance of the Chef's Choice 130 was better than expected, especially with older knives and serrated cutlery. Having mostly used a steel, whet stone, manual and basic electric models in the past to maintain fine edges, we were skeptical going into this test. But sharpening results were amazing; knives now have razor-sharp edges. We gathered about thirty knives for this sharpening test, which we consider to be a generous sampling. Overall, we found that this sharpener saved us a lot of time and guesswork over previously used sharpening equipment.\nFor best sharpening results, reading the manual is a must. This process is easy but will vary depending on the condition of the knife edge and stage required. Some knives only required one stage, while others required several pulls and all three stages.\nMaintenance of the sharpener is simple. There's a magnet on the bottom that requires occasional cleaning with a paper towel. After using the sharpener, knives should be hand washed to remove small metal particles and dried/stored properly.\nAs for function, this sharpener is very versatile. You can touch-up or restore an edge on a variety of cutlery, so that means you only need one sharpener for your kitchen and sporting knives. It's also a compact size, easy to use and store.\nPrice does seem a little high, however, even manual sharpening equipment is pricey and professional sharpening fees can add up. I'd recommend this sharpener for anyone who likes to keep a variety of knives in top condition or finds it difficult to use a steel or manual sharpeners.\nRelated Resources\n"}], [{"score": 289.50726, "uuid": "c9c77fd0-1d1d-5949-abb6-37c6c30e2e60", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0103wb-84-01019", "target_hostname": "www.coldsteel.com", "target_uri": "http://www.coldsteel.com/faqs.html", "page_rank": 4.41781e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "F.A.Q.'s", "snippet": "* Can <em>I</em> leave my kitchen <em>knives</em> in the sink <em>or</em> in the dishwasher? * What does Cold <em>Steel</em> recommend to remove stains from their <em>knives</em>? * <em>I</em> live outside the United States.

Most items are made in Japan, USA, Taiwan, or China.\nBack to Top\nQ: What is San Mai III\u00ae blade construction?\nA simple way to think of San Mai III\u00ae blade construction is to imagine a sandwich: The meat center is hard, high carbon steel and the pieces of bread on either side are the lower-carbon, tough side panels. The edge of the blade should be hard to maximize edge holding ability, but if the entire blade was hard it could be damaged during the rigors of battle. For ultimate toughness the body of the blade must be able to withstand impact and lateral stresses. Toughness is generally associated with \"softness\" and \"flexibility\" in steel, so that, surprisingly, if a blade is made \"tough\" the edge won't be hard enough to offer superior edge holding. San Mai III\u00ae blades provides a blade with hard (higher carbon) steel in the middle for a keen, long lasting edge and tougher (lower-carbon) steel along the sides for flexibility.\nQ: Which knives are made with San Mai III\u00ae blade?\nAs of January, 2007, the following knives were being made with San Mai III\u00ae blades: All of the knives in the Tanto Series (#13BN, #13MBII, #13MBIX, & #13MBXII), The Tai Pan (#13D), The Black Bear Classic (#14BBCJ), The Military Classic (#14R1J), The Natchez Bowie (#16ABSJ), The San Mai III\u00ae Laredo Bowie (#16CCB), The San Mai III\u00ae Trail Master (#16JSM), The Outdoorsman (#18H), The San Mai III\u00ae Gurkha Kukri (#35ATCJ), Master Hunter Plus (#36G), Master Hunter (#36JSK), The San Mai III\u00ae Recon Scout (#37S), The Konjo I and II (#60SK & 60SKL), The Sisu (#60SS).\nFolding knives with San Mai III\u00ae blade are: The Black Sable (#60BS), The Black Talon (#60BT), The Caledonian Edge (#60CE), The Hatamoto (#60H), The Spectre (#60SF), & The Talwar Folder (#60ST).\nBack to Top\nQ: What is VG-1 Stainless Steel?\nWhen considering a new material for a performance upgrade for the Cold Steel\u00ae Tanto, we tested seven different grades of steel including Shiro 2, V-SP-2, 10A, 440C, VG-10, ATS 34, and VG-1. Physical testing for sharpness, edge retention, point strength, shock, and ultimate blade strength showed that while many of the steels had increased performance in one or two testing categories, only one, VG-1, showed the greatest performance increases in the most critical categories. With an outstanding ability to retain an edge and proven strength in point and blade tests, VG-1 will provide Cold Steel\u00ae customers with superior performance previously unavailable in a stainless steel blade.\nBack to Top\nQ: What is German 4116 Stainless Steel?\n4116 is a fine grained, stainless steel made by ThyssenKrupp in Germany and is used for hygienic applications (medical devices and the pharmaceutical industry) and food processing which make it a superb material for kitchen cutlery. The balance of carbon and chromium content give it a high degree of corrosion resistance and also impressive physical characteristics of strength and edge holding. Edge retention in actual cutting tests exceeded blades made of the 420 and 440 series of stainless steels. Other alloying elements contribute to grain refinement which increase blade strength and edge toughness and also allow for a finer, sharper edge.\nBack to Top\nQ: What is 1055 Carbon Steel?\n1055 steel is right on the border between a medium and a high carbon steel, with a carbon content between 0.50%-0.60% and with manganese between 0.60%-0.90% as the only other component. The carbon content and lean alloy make this a shallow hardening steel with a quenched hardness between Rc 60-64 depending on exact carbon content. These combination of factors make this one of the toughest steels available because, when quenched, it produces a near saturated lathe martensite with no excess carbides, avoiding the brittleness of higher carbon materials. This steel is particularly suited to applications where strength and impact resistance is valued above all other considerations and will produce blades of almost legendary toughness.\nBack to Top\nQ: What is SK-5 High Carbon Steel?\nSK-5 is the Japanese equivalent of American 1080, a high carbon steel with carbon between 0.75%-0.85% and 0.60%-0.90% manganese. As quenched, it has a hardness near Rc 65 and produces a mixture of carbon rich martensite with some small un-dissolved carbides. The excess carbide increases abrasion resistance and allows the steel to achieve an ideal balance of very good blade toughness with superior edge holding ability. Due to these characteristics, this grade of steel has been used traditionally for making a variety of hand tools, including chisels and woodcutting saws, and has stood the test of time and use over many years in many countries. Our working temper for these SK-5 steel knives are RC 57-58.\nBack to Top\nQ: What is AUS 8A Stainless Steel?\nThe words \"stainless steel\" are misleading, because, in fact, all steel will stain or show discoloration if left in adverse conditions for a sufficient time. Steel is made \"stainless\" by adding Chromium and reducing its Carbon content during the smelting process. There is a serious performance trade-off with stainless steel. As the Chromium increases and the Carbon decreases, the steel becomes more \"stainless\". But, it also becomes more and more difficult to sharpen, and the edge-holding potential is seriously impaired. This is usually why most stainless knives are rarely razor-sharp and quickly lose what little edge they have. In contrast, at Cold Steel\u00ae we use AUS 8A Stainless, a high carbon, low chromium steel that has proven itself to be the ultimate compromise between toughness and strength, edge holding, and resistance to corrosion.\nBack to Top\nQ: What is Rockwell Hardness?\nThe hardness of steel or other metals is usually measured on a scale called the \"Rockwell Scale\", this scale gives a number value to the hardness. This number is preceded by the letters Rc (for example Rc58). High numbers indicate harder material. If a knife is too \"soft\" meaning it has too low a Rockwell hardness, it will probably not hold an edge and will bend quite easily. If a knife is too \"hard\" meaning it has too high a Rockwell hardness, it will probably be very brittle and difficult to re-sharpen. When a knife is designed, it is important to determine from the beginning what kind of hardness will be required for its ultimate purpose. This will affect the choice of steel. Once the steel is chosen, a heat treatment sequence must be devised to result in the exact hardness needed in the final knife.\nBack to Top\nQ: What is the difference between a Saber Grind and a Flat Grind?\nThese two grinds are quite similar. They are both actually \"flat\", as opposed to concave (hollow ground) or convex. However, a \"Flat ground\" blade is typically ground uniformly from the blade back right to the edge. Where as in a \"Saber ground\" blade, typically only half the width of the blade is ground. The rest remains full thickness, like a traditional saber, hence the name.\nQ: What is the difference between a Rolled Edge and a Cantled Edge?\nCantled Edge is the most widely used edge configuration. It consists of a final grind along the very edge of the primary grind. This final grind forms the sharp edge of the knife. One of the main reasons for its popularity is that the cantled edge is fairly simple to apply by hand or machine. It is also relatively easy to control the angle of the cantle to achieve a desired degree of sturdiness or fineness to the finished edge.\nThe Rolled Edge has been in existence for over 1,000 years and has been used by bladesmiths all around the world. But today it is qui te rare in the knife industry. Some of the finest examples of this edge can be found on early Japanese Katanas. It consists of a continuous curve from the primary grind right to the edge of the knife. There is no \"cantle\" at the edge visible to the naked eye. The only knife that Cold Steel currently makes with a rolled edge is the Stainless Trail Master. A rolled edge is quite difficult to produce in custom quantities and practically impossible in full scale production. The reason for this is that it must be applied by hand, using a \"slack belt\". The honer must constantly monitor his progress very carefully to develop a perfect rolled edge.\nHowever, the result is a cutting edge that will easily outperform a standard cantled edge, because it offers almost no friction during a cutting stroke. It slips effortlessly through the cutting medium. Apart from the difficulty of manufacture, the drawbacks to this type of edge are that it is typically very fine. This means that it is subject to chipping if it comes in contact with very hard materials such as bone. It is also difficult to re-sharpen by someone inexperienced with rolled edges. The only recourse for this individual would be to send the knife back to Cold Steel for factory resharpening or to develop a cantled edge in place of the original rolled edge.\nBack to Top\nQ: Does Cold Steel re-sharpen knives?\nYes. We charge $10 for a fixed blade and $7 for a folding knife. Just send the knife with payment to Cold Steel (3036-A Seaborg Ventura, CA 93003) and we will take care of it. Please note that we re-sharpen knives in batches, so it may take up to 4 weeks before your knife is returned to you.\nBack to Top\nQ: Will Cold Steel re-sharpen my serrated knife?\nYes. Just send the knife with $7 payment to Cold Steel (3036-A Seaborg Ventura, CA 93003) and we will take care of it. Please note that we re-sharpen knives in batches, so it may take up to 4 weeks before your knife is returned to you.\nBack to Top\nQ: How can I re-sharpen my serrated knife?\nWith care, your new knives will remain sharp for a very long time and may never need to be resharpened. If they do start to need resharpening it can be done in one of two ways: First, the back of the serrations can be lightly honed with a standard sharpening system to bring back the edge on the points and flats of the serrations. This method is fairly quick, but if done too aggressively or too often, it will damage the serrations.\nAlternately, a sharpening system with very fine angles can be used to sharpen between the serrations on the front of the knife. This technique is quite time consuming but it is the only way to restore the edge properly. At the moment, we recommend the Sharpmaker system by Spyderco.\nQ: Does Cold Steel sharpen knives made by other manufacturers?\nNo. To avoid potential warranty problems with other companies we are not able to offer this service.\nBack to Top\nQ: What Angle are Cold Steel knives sharpened?\nThis question assumes that you are interested in resharpening a Cold Steel knife. Our knives run a wide range of materials, grinds, types of edge and dimensions, depending on the size, shape and ultimate purpose of the knife. So there is no single edge bevel angle we can recommend. For example actual measured cantle angles for various model Tantos are 25.79\u00b0, 30.99\u00b0 and 28.15\u00b0. We suggest that you use whatever angle most closely matches the one already established on the original factory edge. Generally, we recommend 23\u00b0 to 25\u00b0 as a guiding standard.\nBack to Top\nQ: How do you sharpen a Cold Steel knife?\nThe theory of sharpening is quite simple, although in practice it requires patience and experience to become proficient. The basics are as follows: Start establishing a cantle with an abrasive (stone, sanding belt, etc.). Then further define the cantle by refining the scratch pattern with a series of progressively finer abrasives. A good way to see whether your edge is almost done is to look for the burr that forms along the edge and see if it is consistent all along the length of the edge. Once you have a consistent burr, remove it with a finer abrasive or a strop and your edge is finished.\nFor stainless steels: If the edge requires repair (to remove chips or dinks) or if the cantle has to be reestablished one should begin with a coarse silicon carbide stone (Norton's Crystolon Bench Stone). Initial sharpening should be done with a medium silicon carbide (Norton's Crystolon) or medium aluminum oxide stone (Norton's India Stone). To further refine the edge a fine aluminum oxide stone (Norton's India Stone) would be the next step, followed by a Soft Arkansas for final sharpening. If an extremely refined edge is desired, follow the Soft Arkansas with a Hard Arkansas or 6000-8000 grit Japanese Water Stone. Any ceramic system will work if there is not going to be a lot of material to be removed along the edge (the Sharpmaker by Spyderco is especially good for serrated models).\nFor carbon steels: The same procedure as listed above will work for carbon steels but we have had better results using only the Japanese water stones (Japanese water stones can be found at most woodworking supply stores and catalogs). We suggest beginning with an 800 or 1000 grit water stone and progressing through a 1200-1400 grit and finishing with a 6000-8000 grit stone.\nRolled edges: A rolled edge can be sharpened to its original configuration by using a slack belt on a belt sander (320-400 grit belt) to get a consistent burr and then polishing the burr off with a buffer or leather strop. One can also simply redefine the edge by establishing a cantle on it as outlined above.\nBack to Top\nQ: Can a false edge be sharpened?\nYes, all our blades which have a false edge can have that edge sharpened. This is because the heat treatment is consistent throughout the blade. However, Cold Steel will not sharpen the false edge on a Cold Steel knife, because of time and safety reasons.\nBack to Top\nQ: Are Cold Steel knives guaranteed?\nWarranty: We stand behind our knives and swords 100%. We subject them to the highest standards in the industry and strive to make each as perfect as possible. We warrant that our folding knives, fixed blade sheath knives, and swords are free from defects in workmanship and materials.\nThis warranty does not cover normal wear and tear, re-sharpening of the blade, damage caused by misuse, lack of normal maintenance, or disassembly.\nRemember any knife or sword can break or fail if subjected to sufficient abuse, so please do not use our knives and swords inappropriately and remember no knife or sword should be used as an axe, hatchet, screwdriver, or pry bar.\nBack to Top\nQ: Are Cold Steel knives still guaranteed after they've been sharpened by someone other than Cold Steel?\nIt depends. We have received knives back that have been almost totally destroyed by resharpening on power grinders etc. In fact, some bear almost no resemblance to their original shape! If the knife is damaged in this manner, by inexperienced or overzealous resharpening, it will not be replaced, since this is not a defect in materials or workmanship. However, if the knife fails structurally while in normal use after it has been correctly resharpened, it is still covered by our warranty.\nBack to Top\nQ: What is Cold Steel's return policy?\nWhen you buy a knife from a dealer please ask about his return policy. Each store has its own policy. Some will offer a full credit, others will allow you to exchange for an item of equal value. If you are ever dissatisfied with a Cold Steel product because it breaks in normal use or is in some other way defective, please return it to us with a short explanation of what happened. We will be happy to evaluate the situation and resolve the problem.\nBack to Top\nQ: Do all Cold Steel knives have a full tang?\nFull tang construction is an important consideration when evaluating the strength of a knife. Originally, \"full tang\" meant a handle in which the edges of the tang are visible all around the outside of the hilt, so that the tang is fully as wide as the knife handle. However, with the advent of \"driven-on\" Kraton\u00ae handles, full tang has come to mean that a very substantial tang extends completely through the center of the handle right to the back of the pommel. This describes the tangs on all premium Cold Steel knives.\nBack to Top\nQ: How is Kraton\u00ae attached to the handles of Cold Steel knives?\nTo the best of our knowledge, Cold Steel was the first knife company in the U.S. to use Kraton\u00ae for the handle of a knife. Obviously we were correct in our choice of this material, because over the last 18 years almost every major manufacturer has adopted it for knife handles. There are two main ways to build a Kraton\u00ae handle.\nThe first is to make a \"driven-on\" handle. This is where the Kraton\u00ae handle is heated up to expand it slightly, then driven on top the tang of the blade. Once in place it can be held there by a ferrule or a bolt.\nThe second method is to make a \"shot-on\" handle. In this type of construction, the liquid Kraton\u00ae material is injected under heat and pressure around the tang of the blade where it hardens. Once it has hardened it is permanently attached to the tang and needs no bolts or a ferrule.\nBack to Top\nQ: How are Cold Steel Tomahawks made?\nCold Steel tomahawks are precision drop forged from 1055 carbon steel. During the forging process a metal ingot is heated almost white hot and then formed into shape in a series of progressive dies. The large steel dies are fixed to enormous compressed air hammers with hundreds of tons of power behind every strike. Each die, hammers the hot metal into a gradually more finished shape. During this forming process the steel is kneaded and compressed into a completely homogenous mass. And this, in turn, makes it extremely tough and strong. Like all good tomahawks, Cold Steel's are differentially heat treated. This means that the cutting edge and hammer face is fully hardened, while the balance of the head is left relatively soft to absorb the shock of striking blows. Drop forging not only creates a superior product, but it is also an extremely efficient method of manufacture. The quality of our drop forged tomahawks is superior to custom, hand forged hawks costing three and even four times more!\nBack to Top\nQ: Did the Tanto really go through the car door?\nYes, this has been done in repeated tests without damage to the point. It has also been done in \"real life\" situations where the Tanto was used to cut the lock out of a car door to free a person trapped inside the vehicle. It is important to note that the point of the Tanto is undamaged after this ordeal. Some people discount this test because they say that some cheaper knives can also be hammered through a car door. But what they fail to realize is that none of these cheaper knives will have a usable point afterwards!\nQ: Why does the Safe Keeper III have a hole in its blade?\nThis is simply a design feature to add interest and to lighten the blade.\nQ: Are push knives illegal?\nThat depends on the blade configuration (length, single or double edged) and your local laws. We cannot give a legal opinion.\nBack to Top\nQ: What is the maximum legal blade length that can be carried?\nThat depends on the blade configuration (single or double edged) and your local laws. We cannot give a legal opinion. It is your responsibility to determine the legal position in your own area.\nBack to Top\nQ: What is \"Blueing\"?\nBlueing is a process applied to the blade to offer a protective, less-reflective coat. There are many commercially available packages for both hot and cold blueing. The process results in a blue-black surface on the blade of the knife. It can be quite difficult to get an even bluing over the whole blade. Cold steel does not endorse or recommend this process yourself, instead you should have it done professionally to achieve the best results. Also please see the next item.\nBack to Top\nQ: Can Cold Steel knives be blued?\nYes, but this is extremely difficult with the stainless steel models. However, all the carbon steel models can be either hot or cold blued. Please note that this blueing may affect your warranty.\nBack to Top\nQ: Can I leave my kitchen knives in the sink or in the dishwasher?\nThe short answer to this is no! Most stainless kitchen cutlery is made from high chromium, low carbon steel. This makes it very \"stainless\", in that there is no carbon to discolor, even if the knife is left soaking in water for weeks. But it also means that it is practically impossible to sharpen to a good edge and that whatever edge it has will be lost very quickly.\nAt Cold Steel we use very high carbon stainless steel for our kitchen knives. The same steel, in fact, as in the Tanto. This allows us to create a blade that is very thin and incredibly sharp, while still remaining very strong. Unfortunately the trade-off means that the blade requires a little more care than some of your other stainless cutlery. For example, it is not recommended that you use your Cold Steel Kitchen Knives to saw through frozen food or to cut bones, as these actions will surely damage your blade. These small shortcomings, however, are more than offset by the phenomenal performance of the knives.\nAlthough they will survive being in the dishwasher this is not recommended (apart from potential staining, the fine edge can be easily damaged in contact with other steel cutlery). They should never be left standing in water or left in damp conditions for any length of time. To keep our kitchen knives in the best possible condition, we recommend that the knives are rinsed in water, dried and put away immediately after use, as with any fine cutlery. Any discoloration that may occur over time, will not effect the performance of the knives.\nBack to Top\nQ: What does Cold Steel recommend to remove stains from their knives?\nAny of the mildly abrasive polishing pastes like Flitz or Simichrome. These are available at most hardware stores and gun stores.\nBack to Top\nQ: Does Cold Steel ever make custom knives?\nNo, but there are hundreds of custom knifemakers in this country that would be glad to make a knife to your exact specifications. Listings can be found in any of the knife publications (Blade Magazine, Knife World, Knives Illustrated) or any of the Knife annuals.\nBack to Top\nQ: Do all Cold Steel knives come with a sheath?\nMost of our fixed blade models come with sheaths; they are either made of Concealex, Cor-Ex, or Leather.\nQ: Does Cold Steel sell replacement sheaths?\nYes, we do. Please call for price, style and availbility.\nBack to Top\nQ: My pocket clip is broken. What do I do?\nCold Steel sells replacement clips. Metal clips are $5.00 plus $2.50 shipping. We are no longer replacing the older style Voyagers with broken plastic clips, instead, as a courtesy, we will replace the product at 40% off of the Suggested Retail price.\nBack to Top\nQ: How do I become a Cold Steel dealer?\nWe need copies of the following: 1) Business license, 2) Tax ID form (not just the number) 3.) your FFL (if applicable), or 4) a Resale Certificate. Some states/counties do not require all this information to operate, please contact Cold Steel if you have any questions: Click here for dealer inquiry form\nBack to Top\nQ: I live outside the United States. Can I receive the free DVD and Catalog?\nThe free DVD and catalog offer is good only for residents of the United States. We will send a catalog and DVD to foreign countries for a nominal shipping charge. Canada is $5.00. All other countries $15.00. Please send a money order to Cold Steel for the amount in U.S. dollars or phone us with a credit card number at 805-650-8481.\n"}, {"score": 286.24786, "uuid": "bdbf366c-3140-53f5-a18b-2d0de0e2e577", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0800wb-48-05261", "target_hostname": "forums.egullet.org", "target_uri": "http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?/topic/26036-knife-maintenance-and-sharpening/", "page_rank": 1.2366376e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "Knife Maintenance and Sharpening - eG Forums", "snippet": "Glass, <em>ceramic</em>, marble and <em>steel</em> will cause the edge to roll <em>or</em> chip.

Or, if you decide to send them out, you\u0092ll know how to make sure you\u0092re getting what you want \u0096 and what you pay for.\nSection One: The Sad Truth About Kitchen Knives\nTo a chef, there is nothing more important than his knife. It is not only an extension of his hands, it is an extension of his very personality. The knife is a chef\u0092s paintbrush.\nSo why are most kitchen knives so bad?\nThe knives found in most commercial and home kitchens are designed for the lowest common denominator. The manufacturers of these knives make a series of compromises calculated to keep the largest number of people happily using their knives for the longest period of time. Like supermarket tomatoes bred for sturdiness and uniformity rather than flavor, these compromises seriously degrade the performance of your knives.\nThe first compromise begins with the steel. Steel is the heart of the knife. Most manufacturers (Henckels, Wusthof, Forschner, et al.) have proprietary steel blends and are very close-mouthed about the actual formulation of their steels. According to industry insiders, these steel blends are closely related to or equivalent to a steel known as 440a. By and large 440a steel is formulated for stain and wear resistance rather than holding a high performance edge.\nIn the kitchen, that\u0092s not a bad tradeoff.\nBut this compromise in edge performance is compounded by a heat treatment that leaves the steel much softer than it could be. In general, the harder the steel, the keener the edge it will take. However, a hard steel makes it more difficult to get that edge in the first place. So manufacturers leave the steel a little soft, theoretically making sharpening at home easier. If you\u0092ve ever spent an hour or two trying to get a super fine edge on a cheap kitchen knife, you\u0092ll know that there is a big gap between theory and practice.\nUpper-end kitchen knives like Henckels, Sabatier, Wusthof, et al., are a little better, but are still softer than they need to be at 52 to 56 on the Rockwell C scale (the Rockwell scale is a scale used to measure the relative hardness of different solids). By contrast, Japanese knives tend to be around 61-62 on the Rockwell scale. Custom knife maker Phil Wilson hardens his S90V (a stainless supersteel) chef\u0092s and filet knives to 62-63 Rockwell.\nThe next compromise is in the factory edge angles. Most kitchen knives come with an edge that is at least 25 degrees per side, frequently even greater. If you add the two sides together you get a 50 degree included angle. And that\u0092s the best case scenario. Take a look at a protractor if you happen to have one lying around. Fifty degrees is extremely thick. An angle that obtuse is more appropriate for an axe than a chef\u0092s knife. Again, the theory is that the thick angles will allow the edge to resist damage from impaction, rolling and wear better than a thin edge. But, as the song says, it ain\u0092t necessarily so.\nFinally, there is just plain cruelty and misuse. While I\u0092m certain none of you would ever use the sharpener on the back of an electric can opener, or use a glass cutting board, or store your knives loose in a drawer or put them in the dishwasher, it does happen. And when you add soft steel and thick angles to the general abuse that knives see in the kitchen, you end up with tools that are more adapted for bludgeoning oxen than fine dicing a soft tomato.\nTake heart. The news isn\u0092t all bad. We can fix these problems. Geometry is far more important than steel. With some basic knowledge and the willingness to invest a little time, you can realistically expect a dramatic increase in knife performance.\nFirst, do no harm: General knife care\n- Use wooden or composite plastic cutting boards only. Glass, ceramic, marble and steel will cause the edge to roll or chip. Bad. Don\u0092t do it.\n- Don\u0092t drop your knives in the sink. Not only is it a hazard to the person washing dishes, but you can also blunt the tip or edge.\n- Don\u0092t put your knives in the dishwasher. The heat may damage wooden handles and the edges may bang against other cutlery or plates.\n- Keep your knives clean and dry. Sanitize if necessary.\n- Do not store your knives loose in a drawer. Use a block, magnetic strip, slotted hanger or edge guards. The magnetic strip is not recommended if you have children or inquisitive pets.\n- Finally, your knife is not a can opener, a screwdriver, a pry bar, box cutter or hammer. There\u0092s a special place in Hell reserved for people who abuse their knives this way.\nIf your knives won\u0092t fit in a block, simple plastic blade guards are a good solution\nSecond: Modify for performance\nThis is the easy part. Establishing and maintaining high performance edges is what this tutorial is all about. It can be as simple as steeling with the proper technique or as complex as creating specific edge bevel and edge aggression strategies for each knife in your collection. It\u0092s all up to you.\nWhile you can\u0092t change the steel your knife is made from, you can certainly keep your knives at peak performance \u0096 and without too much difficulty. We\u0092ll discuss high performance edges and sharpening strategies a little later in the tutorial.\nThird: Modify for comfort\nThis is something very few chefs (and even relatively few knife makers) take into consideration. Ask any chef to show you his knife-hand calluses. He\u0092ll have a thick one at the base of his first finger from the \u0093pinch grip\u0094 used in most kitchens. He or she may also have another on the side of the second finger where the finger rubs against the bolster or dropped portion of the blade that extends below the handle.\nHe will also have aching hands and possible repetitive stress injuries.\nIn the interest of economy, most knife manufacturers leave the spines of their knives squared off. The edges of the spine can sometimes be sharper than the knife itself. That edge cutting into your finger can lead to blisters, calluses, reduced circulation, numbness and injury.\nIf you ever handle a chef\u0092s knife made by Canadian knife maker George Tichbourne you\u0092ll know that it doesn\u0092t have to be that way. Tichbourne worked with several professional chefs when designing his kitchen knife series. One of the key features is a smoothly rounded spine. It doesn\u0092t abrade your finger, cut off the circulation, make your hands numb or create any of the other discomforts associated with standard kitchen knives.\nYou can do the same in less than half an hour. Lock your knife, edge down, into a padded vise. The padding doesn\u0092t have to be anything elaborate. Two pieces of flat rubber or leather will keep the jaws from scratching the blade. You\u0092ll need a sheet of fine (600 grit) wet/dry sandpaper available at any auto supply store or an abrasive cloth, sometimes called a crocus cloth. Using a gentle shoeshine motion, lightly round the edges of the spine. You don\u0092t have to buff hard or remove a lot of metal. All you need to do is break the sharp edge at the base of the spine. How far you take it is up to you. This simple modification will make a world of difference in the comfort of your knives.\nSection Two: Steel\nAn Overview of Steel\nBy definition, steel is a combination of iron and less than 2 percent carbon. For centuries, carbon was the only alloying element. The problem in the early days of steel making was getting rid of unwanted elements, not adding new ones. However, there are a variety of alloying elements that are added to modern steels to impart various characteristics.\nIron alone is relatively soft. It does not hold an edge well, wears quickly and has little resistance to bending. Add a little bit of carbon and the story changes dramatically. The carbon combines with the iron to form hard carbide platelets cemented together in a matrix of iron. The combination is resistant to wear and bending and will take a keen edge.\nSmaller carbides and a tighter grain structure allow for a stronger, sharper edge. Other carbide formers, like vanadium, can refine the grain of the steel further. Knives with a high vanadium content can take a very keen edge, but are harder to sharpen.\nCarbon - Present in all steels, it is the most vital hardening element. Greater than 0.5 percent carbon content qualifies a steel as a \u0093high carbon\u0094 steel.\nChromium - Added for wear resistance and corrosion resistance. A steel with at least 13 percent chromium is considered \u0093stainless.\u0094 Chromium is a carbide former, so it also increases wear resistance.\nManganese - A carbide former. Manganese aids grain structure, increases hardenability, and wear resistance. Manganese is present in most cutlery steels.\nMolybdenum - Another carbide former. Increases hardness, prevents brittleness, makes the steel easier to machine.\nNickel - Adds toughness and possibly aids in corrosion resistance.\nPhosphorus - Essentially a contaminant.\nSilicon - Increases hardness and strength.\nSulfur - Increases machinability but decreases toughness.\nTungsten - Increases heat, wear and shock resistance. Tungsten is the strongest carbide former behind vanadium.\nVanadium - Another carbide former. Contributes to wear resistance and hardenability. Vanadium refines the grain of the steel, which contributes to toughness and allows the blade to take a very sharp edge.\nMost kitchen knives fall into the category of \u0093high carbon stainless.\u0094 These knives generally contain between 0.5 and 0.8 percent carbon, 13 to 18 percent chromium and a little manganese, molybdenum, silicon, phosphorus and sulphur. This makes for a steel that is easy to produce, is very stain resistant and reasonably wear resistant. Knives from Global and Mac\u0092s Superior line have some vanadium added for improved wear resistance and a finer grain, which allows the knife to be sharpened to an incredible edge.\nCarbon Steel versus Stainless Steel\nThe great debate rages on. Carbon steel advocates claim that their knives take a keener edge, hold it longer and are easier to resharpen than stainless steel knives. Stainless steel users claim that carbon steel knives are unsanitary, leave an off taste in foods and that stainless knives hold an edge longer than their carbon counterparts.\nWho\u0092s right? Depends on your definitions and your environment. It\u0092s not as simple as carbon versus stainless.\nCarbon steels range from simple iron/carbon combinations to high-alloy tool steels that will cut through concrete without losing their edge. Stainless steels vary from very soft, extremely stain resistant dive knives to super stainless alloys, like Crucible Particle Metals\u0092 S30V, a steel purpose-designed for the custom cutlery industry.\nIn the far less demanding realm of the kitchen, however, the carbon steel devotees are right. At least until they actually have to use their knives. Then it\u0092s a different story.\nCarbon steel kitchen knives generally are a little harder and stronger than stainless steel kitchen knives. They are easy to sharpen and take a screaming edge. And while the patina that develops on a carbon knife can be unsightly (unless you like that sort of thing), it isn\u0092t unsanitary.\nBut in the wet, acidic environment of the kitchen, stainless rules. For all their faults, compromises and shortcomings, stainless steel kitchen knives work better and will hold their edges longer than carbon steel knives.\nDoesn\u0092t make sense, does it?\nThe culprit is corrosion \u0096 the effect of acid and micro-rusting. Even on what appears to be a mirror-bright, razor sharp edge, microscopic particles of rust and corrosion will form, attacking the edge and reducing its performance. Unless carbon steel knives are rinsed and dried frequently, their edges will degrade rapidly in kitchen use. The stainless edge will easily outlast them.\nAccording to chef and knife maker Thomas Haslinger , \u0093Acids of fruit and vegetables are fairly aggressive and will dull a carbon blade more quickly than stainless. The acid actually eats the edge.\u0094\nSection Three: Edge Basics\nMost kitchen knives are flat ground, meaning that the blade tapers directly from the spine to the edge. Hollow ground, convex ground and saber ground blades are rarely found in the kitchen. I mention them only to confuse you.\nEdges come in a variety of flavors. The most common are the V-edge, double beveled edge, chisel ground edge and the convex edge.\nV-edges and double beveled edges are variations on a theme. The edge found on your kitchen knives is most likely a V-edge, meaning, oddly enough, that the edge bevels form a V, two surfaces intersecting at a line of (ideally) zero width.\nA double bevel takes this idea a little further by adding a second, more acute, angle behind the edge bevel. This secondary bevel is sometimes called a back bevel or relief angle. It\u0092s purpose is to thin the metal behind the edge. The thinner the edge, the greater the cutting ability. However, an edge that is too thin is susceptible to damage. So you add a smaller, more obtuse primary bevel to the very edge to give it the strength to avoid damage from impaction, chipping or rolling.\nChisel ground edges are primarily found on Japanese knives, especially sushi knives. The edge is ground only on one side. The other is side is flat. Hence they come in right and left handed versions. Chisel ground edges can be extremely thin and sharp. If the edge bevel is ground at 25 degrees and the other side is 0 degrees, you have an included angle of 25 degrees \u0096 considerably more acute than the average Western knife.\nSometimes known as hamaguri-ba, the convex edge arcs in a rounded curve down to the edge. Thus the final edge is the intersection of two arcs, creating a very sharp edge with more metal behind it than the standard V-edge. Convex edges are generally formed on a slack belt grinder, so they are difficult for the home sharpener to achieve. This can be remedied with the mousepad trick found later in the tutorial. See the Convex Grind FAQ for sharpening methods and a comparison of the convex edge with other edge types.\nA double bevel. The wide area is a 10 degree back bevel; the narrow section is the 15 degree primary edge face.\nThe back bevel also solves one of the great problems with V-edges, the fact that the metal behind the edge gets progressively thicker as the knife is sharpened over time. The knife doesn\u0092t cut as well and becomes harder and harder to sharpen. The answer is to grind the shoulders off the edge at an acute angle, i.e. add a back bevel, then reestablish the primary bevel.\nIf you sharpen your knife without grinding a relief angle, your edge will thicken over time.\nMicro-serrations: True or False?\nKnife geeks frequently talk about \u0093micro-serrations,\u0094 microscopic teeth on the edge of the knife. Is this really true? In a word, yes. Sharpening by its very nature creates a scratch pattern on the edge of the knife. The coarser the stone, the coarser and deeper the scratch pattern will be and the larger the micro-serrations. Conversely, the finer the stone, the finer and more polished the edge will be with less prominent micro-serrations. The real question is, which one is better?\nThis is one of the great debates in the knife world \u0096 the razor sharp polished edge versus a toothier edge.\nJohn Juranitch in his book \u0093The Razor Edge Book of Sharpening\u0094 is emphatic that a polished edge is the answer, that micro-serrations are indicative of a dull knife. His experience comes from sharpening knives for the meat processing industry. Meat cutters go through knives faster than tissues in flu season, so Juranitch\u0092s conclusions are hard to dispute.\nHowever, Joe Talmadge, author of the Bladeforums \u0093Sharpening FAQ;\u0094 Cliff Stamp, physicist and knife nut; Leonard Lee, president of Lee Valley Tools and author of \u0093The Complete Guide to Sharpening;\u0094 and many others have come to the opposite conclusion: that micro-serrations, in the right context, can be a very good thing.\nWhat is the right context? Later on we\u0092ll examine the difference between push cutting and slicing, their applications in the kitchen and the value of various levels of polish on your knife edges. Which leads us directly to:\nThe Meaning of Sharpness\nWhat do we mean when we say that we want our knives to be sharp? Seems like a silly question. We all know what sharp is. Or do we?\nSharpness is not just a function of creating a super-thin edge that will readily sever free-hanging nose hairs; it\u0092s also a function of shape and intended purpose. You could grind your chef\u0092s knife to razor thinness, but the edge would crumble the first time you hit a bone or tried to hammer your way through a winter squash. Your knife would be sharp but useless. Similarly, a razor sharp but wedge-thick edge is great on a splitting axe but not much good for carpaccio.\nWe have to take into consideration the shape of the blade, the angle of the edge bevel and especially the material being cut when we consider how we judge the sharpness of our kitchen knives.\nSo the real question is not \u0093how sharp should my knife be,\u0094 but rather \u0093how do I get maximum performance from my knife under a given set of conditions.\u0094 A sharp knife can be defined as one that has a keen edge that can hold up in repeated usage while producing the results we\u0092re looking for in the kitchen.\nThe Myth of Thick Edges\nThe theory is that thick edges (larger angles) last longer than thin edges, and the majority of the knife buying public wants the edge to last as long as possible. But it doesn\u0092t work out that way in practice. Thinner edges actually outlast thicker edges almost all the time.\nThe thinner edge starts out performing better than the thicker edge. So even if it does degrade it has a lot of ground to lose before it falls to the performance level of the thick edge.\nThinner edges cut more easily, putting less stress on the edge. If a thin edge takes three slices to get through a big slab of raw meat, a thicker edge might take six or seven. Or three with a lot more force. The thicker edge is doing twice as much work, degrading twice as quickly.\nThinner edges are easier to control. Lateral stresses are a significant source of edge degradation. The more smoothly, accurately and easily you are able to cut, the less lateral stress you put on the edge.\nThin is good.\nA very thin, high performance 10/15 double bevel. The knife is an 8\u0094 custom chef\u0092s knife in ATS-34 steel from Steve Mullin.\nThe High Performance Edge\nWe want our kitchen knives to cut as easily as possible while maintaining integrity and staying sharp.\nFor maximum performance, you want the edge as thin as possible. To borrow an image from Joe Talmadge, imagine a woman stepping on your foot. If she\u0092s wearing tennis shoes, it will hurt a lot less than if she\u0092s wearing stiletto heels. The same amount of force applied to a much smaller area penetrates better. A knife edge a thousandth of an inch thick with one pound of pressure behind it concentrates 1,000 pounds of pressure per square inch at the edge. While an actual kitchen knife\u0092s edge will be a little thicker than a thousandth of an inch, the thinner your knife\u0092s edge, the more efficiently it will cut.\nTo thin a knife\u0092s edge, you lower the edge angle. The problem is that a thin edge is much more susceptible to damage. As the edge becomes thinner, there is less metal to support it. It can roll, indent and chip, causing the edge to degrade quickly.\nSo the goal is to thin the edge as much as possible, but not so much that it is regularly damaged during hard use. One way to do this is to keep thinning your edge until it reaches an unacceptable level of fragility then back off a couple of degrees. This is easier than it sounds, but not really necessary. We\u0092ll discuss suitable edge angles in just a moment.\nOne factor that strongly plays into how thin you can take a knife\u0092s edge is the quality of the steel. That\u0092s one of the primary advantages to the new breed of incredibly hard stainless super steels. You can sharpen them to very acute angles without risk of significant damage. As an aside, I\u0092ve taken a chef\u0092s knife made from ATS-34 down to less than 8 degrees per side before it required an unacceptable level of maintenance.\nAs we\u0092ve discovered, the average kitchen knife is made from pretty mediocre steel. But it can still be much thinner than the factory edge. As a matter of fact you can sharpen your Henckels and Wusthofs to angles that would give the good folks in Solingen the heebie-jeebies without worrying too much.\nSection Four: Sharpening Basics\nBefore we get into sharpening systems and the actual mechanics of sharpening, it helps to understand some of the basic principles. These are the burr, the sharpening angles, the abrasive, consistency and sharpening strategy. They apply no matter what sharpening method you choose.\nThe Burr\nFirst and most foremost is the burr. The burr is your friend. A burr, or wire edge, is a rough, almost microscopic, raised lip of metal that forms when one edge meets the other. It is the only way to be absolutely certain that you have fully ground an edge. Essentially you grind one side until it meets the other and pushes up a small curl of metal. If you stop sharpening before the burr is formed, your knife will not be as sharp as it could be.\nSometimes you can\u0092t see a burr, but you can always feel it. You check for a burr on the side opposite the edge you have been grinding. Hold the knife blade horizontally and place your fingers or thumb at a 45-degree angle to the edge and pull gently down and away. DO NOT PULL TOWARD THE TIP OR HILT; YOU MAY LOP OFF A FINGER. PULL AWAY FROM THE EDGE. Remember, check the side opposite the one you've been sharpening. You're checking for a very light lip caused by the edge rolling over to the other side. Check at various points along the edge. The burr tends to form quickly at the base of the blade but takes a little longer at the tip. You must feel a burr running all the way from heel to tip to know that you have fully ground that side of the knife.\nHand position for checking a burr.\nThe Angles\nAs we\u0092ve discussed, the 50-degree-plus included angle that comes standard on most kitchen knives is way too obtuse. Leonard Lee suggests anywhere from 5 to 20 degrees per side (10 to 40 degrees total) for general kitchen work. Five degrees per side is incredibly thin and would require a very hard, high quality steel to keep that edge in regular use.\nFor the vast majority of kitchen knives, 15 to 20 degrees per side will provide a significant increase in performance without requiring undue maintenance. Meat cleavers should be a little thicker, say 20 to 25 degrees per side, while dedicated slicers can be taken down to 10 to 15 degrees per side.\nThe best compromise in the kitchen has proven to be a 15/20 double bevel. That is a 15 degree back bevel with a 20 degree primary edge face.\nA 15/20 double bevel illustrated. This is an excellent performer in the kitchen.\nAbrasives\nYou sharpen your knives by scraping away metal. That\u0092s really all there is too it. But there is a huge array of abrasives available.\nTraditionalists will demand an Arkansas stone. These stones were originally mined from a novaculite deposit in Arkansas. They were graded, from softest to hardest, as Washita, Soft Arkansas, Hard Arkansas and Black Hard Arkansas. However, the best parts of the deposit were mined long ago, leading to spotty quality in the natural stones. They have since been replaced by ground novaculite reconstituted into benchstones. These can be found under the Arkansas Perfect name.\nSynthetic aluminum oxide stones are very, very hard and don\u0092t wear like natural stones. They clean up easily with a scouring pad and are more consistent in their grading systems. Spyderco and Lansky both manufacture synthetic stones in a variety of grits (see discussion of grits below).\nJapanese waterstones are considered by many to be the ultimate sharpening tools. Although natural waterstones are extremely expensive and hard to find, reconstituted stones are readily available. These reconstituted Japanese stones are held together by a resin bond, cut very quickly (and wear more quickly as well) and are available in extremely fine grits that will put a high polish on an edge.\nSynthetic waterstones, as used by EdgePro systems, are formulated from aluminum oxide specifically for knife sharpening. Like Japanese waterstones, they need to be wet in order to cut effectively.\nDiamond \u0093stones\u0094 have man-made diamond particles imbedded in or coated on a base metal. They cut very aggressively and should be used with caution. They were formerly available only in very coarse grits, but that is changing rapidly. According to Leonard Lee, monocrystalline diamonds are preferable to polycrystalline diamonds in a diamond stone. They are nearly twice as expensive, but last much longer. EZE-Lap, Lansky and DMT make excellent diamond stones.\nThere are two other issues related to abrasives that must be considered: grits and lubrication.\nYou Want Grits with That?\nAll of these abrasives come in a variety of grits from very coarse to ultra-fine. Grit refers to the size of the individual particles of abrasive in the sharpening stone. A stone with a finer grit has smaller particles, and produces an more polished edge with less prominent micro-serrations. A stone with a coarser grit has larger particles, produces an edge with more prominent micro-serrations, and tends to abrade metal away more quickly. There are several different grit rating systems, and unfortunately it is very difficult to correlate these different systems. For example, Japanese waterstones are graded differently than diamond stones and both have different numbering systems than the codes found on powered grindstones. Steve Bottorff, author of \u0093Sharpening Made Easy\u0094 has taken a stab at it here if you\u0092re interested.\nWhat we do know is that you\u0092ll need a coarse to medium stone for shaping the edge and removing the shoulders of over-thick edges. You\u0092ll also need a fine stone for sharpening the final edge. The combination stones found in most hardware stores just won\u0092t do the trick. The coarse side isn\u0092t coarse enough and the fine side isn\u0092t fine enough. Any of the sharpening systems mentioned later will come with appropriate stones.\nIn very general and imprecise terms, stones rated lower than 300 grit are coarse, 300-400 are medium, 600+ are fine and 1200 and up are extra fine.\nJapanese waterstones have their own grit rating system. They cut so quickly that anything below 800x can be considered coarse, although they\u0092ll leave a much more polished edge than a corresponding Western stone. 1000x and 1200x can be considered medium and medium-fine and make an excellent general purpose stones. Waterstones can go up to 8000x, but that\u0092s really overkill for kitchen purposes.\nThe stones that come with Spyderco\u0092s Sharpmaker are listed as fine (the white stones) and medium (the grey stones). The grey has been compared to an approximately 800x waterstone, the white to a 1200x waterstone in effect.\nThe synthetic waterstones from EdgePro systems also have an idiosyncratic rating system. The coarse stone is listed as 100, the medium as 180, the fine 220, extra fine 320, ultra fine is 600. However a conversation with Ben Dale, owner of EdgePro, revealed that the extra fine stone is equivalent to a 1200x Japanese waterstone and the ultra fine equivalent to a 2000x Japanese stone. The basic system comes with a medium and fine stone, which should be sufficient for most needs, though the coarse stone comes in handy for quickly reshaping bevels.\nOil or Water?\nEveryone knows you need to lubricate your sharpening stone with water or oil, right? So the question is which one is better. Neither. The purpose of a sharpening stone is to grind the edge and remove metal. Oil reduces friction and makes the process much slower.\nSupposedly oil helps float away metal particles that would otherwise clog the pores of the stone. You can do the same thing by wiping the stone with a damp cloth when you\u0092re done. Steve Bottorff reports that you can clean your Arkansas stones with paint thinner. Synthetic stones clean up with a scouring pad and abrasive cleanser.\nAccording to Joe Talmadge, if you have already used oil on your Arkansas stone, you\u0092ll probably need to keep using oil. But if you have a new Arkansas stone, a diamond stone or a synthetic stone, go ahead and use it without oil or water. It will work much better.\nJohn Juranitch reports that in his company\u0092s work with meat processing plants they discovered that the metal filings suspended in the oil on a stone actually chip and abrade the edge. Although these chips were only visible through a microscope, the meatpackers readily noticed the difference between the knives sharpened on a dry stone and those sharpened on oiled stones.\nWaterstones are another matter entirely. Both Japanese and synthetic waterstones require water in order to cut effectively. Japanese waterstones can be damaged if used dry and must be soaked thoroughly before use. Waterstones wear very quickly, revealing new layers of cutting abrasive as the swarf builds up and is washed away. That\u0092s why they are so effective. There is always a new layer of sharp abrasive cutting away at the metal of your edge. By the way, \u0093swarf\u0094 is one of those cool terms you get to toss around when you discuss sharpening. Swarf is the slurry of metal filings and stone grit that builds up as you sharpen. Throw that into your next cocktail party conversation and just watch the expressions of awe appear as people realize that you are a sharpening God.\nConsistency\nYou must be able to maintain a consistent angle while you are sharpening. This can be tough to do, which is why there are so many gimmicks and sharpening systems on the market. They don\u0092t provide any magic. All they do is help you keep your edge at the same angle throughout the sharpening session.\nMaintaining consistency is a primary reason freehand sharpening with benchstones or waterstones is a little tricky. It takes a lot of experience and practice to keep the edge at a constant angle stroke after stroke using only your hands and eyes.\nSharpening Strategy: Coarse versus Polished Edges\nRelated to the grit discussion above, the finer the stone you use to sharpen your knife, the more polished your edge will be. And while it can be a lot of fun to create a scary sharp edge that will cut the tops off of arm hair without touching the skin, it\u0092s really not necessary or ideal for kitchen use.\nAs a matter of fact, leaving the edge of your knife just a little coarse can be a very good thing. This is where we must compare push cutting to slicing.\nPush cutting involves parting fibers and requires a polished edge. Shaving, for example, is push cutting. So is peeling an apple or julienning a carrot. You are pressing your thin, finely polished edge through the fibers of the food, pushing them to either side.\nSlicing, on the other hand, involves severing fibers and requires a toothier edge. Crusty bread, a soft tomato, roast chicken \u0096 anything with an outer layer that is tougher than the squishier inside demands an edge that can bite into the skin without crushing the interior. A highly polished edge will simply skate over the surface of a ripe plum until you put enough pressure on it to push through the skin. But the fruit underneath will give way before that happens. Not pretty.\nNow you must decide. Do you do more push cutting or more slicing? Do you have knives that you use more often for dicing, peeling and julienning? Do you have a knife that is dedicated to slicing?\nA good basic strategy is to start with a standard 20 degree bevel (a 15/20 double bevel if you\u0092re feeling adventurous) with a moderately polished edge on all your knives. This alone will be a vast improvement over what you might be used to.\nThen branch out. If you have a knife that is only used for vegetables, a santoku for example, you can take it to a very fine, highly polished edge. A dedicated slicer can be finished on a medium-fine grit stone, leaving the edge slightly coarse. Your chef\u0092s knife can be somewhere in between.\nThere is one caveat. The thinner the edge, the finer it will need to be to avoid excessive damage. A coarse edge wears more quickly and requires more maintenance. This is usually not an issue unless you like your edges very thin. Then a polished edge will last longer. Of course if you have a very thin edge it will probably push cut through materials that a thicker edge might have to slice through, so you\u0092re not losing any slicing performance.\nIf you\u0092re really nuts you can create a dual edge on your knives. This would be a slightly coarse section at the back of the blade near the choil or bolster. The rest of the blade would be finished on a fine or extra fine stone. That gives you a toothy section for cutting through tough materials as you begin your stroke and a finer edge for push cutting through the rest. Yes, this is only for the seriously deranged.\nSection Five: Sharpening Step by Step\nHey, 5,000 words into this and we\u0092re actually getting to the \u0093how-to\u0094 part.\nOkay, here\u0092s where we put all of this together.\nHaul out your sharpening rig and let\u0092s grind some metal. Don\u0092t have one yet? Check out the Sharpening Systems section below to see what suits you best.\nGot one now? Good.\nRemember the basics: burr, angle, abrasive, consistency and strategy. Let\u0092s assume, for the sake of discussion, that you\u0092ve decided to put a 15/20 double bevel on your chef\u0092s knife. Because it\u0092s a general purpose knife, it doesn\u0092t need to have a mirror polished edge. As a matter of fact, a good medium-fine edge is what you\u0092re aiming for. This is your angle and strategy.\nBecause this is the first time you\u0092ve really tried to change the horrid factory edge, you\u0092ll need to begin with a fast cutting, coarse abrasive. Benchstone, waterstone, Sharpmaker grey stone \u0096 doesn\u0092t matter. Start with the coarsest thing you\u0092ve got.\nDetermine how you\u0092re going to establish consistency. With a Sharpmaker you simply stroke straight up and down. The EdgePro or Lansky rod-type systems have angle guides built in. Freehand sharpening requires a little more skill and patience, but if you use a guide system like the Razor Edge or simply place your thumb on the spine in the same spot every time, you can create a consistent angle.\nAdvanced Section:\nQuote\nWarning: Math! If you want to be really anal about it, Leonard Lee offers this formula for creating freehand angles of less than 20 degrees. \u0093Use the basic rule that a 1 degree angle subtends an arc of 1 unit at a radius of 60 units. The 1-in-60 rule is close enough for many purposes, particularly sharpening at low angles. You\u0092ll find that a 10-unit rise in 60 units is about 9-1/2 degrees and a 20-unit rise is about 19 degrees.\u0094\nThis works out to raising the spine 1/8 inch (measured 1.5 inches back from the edge) for every five degrees of angle. The average chef\u0092s knife is about 1.5 inches wide at the heel, so for a 15 degree angle you\u0092d raise the spine 3/8 inch \u0096 about the height of six quarters stacked up.\nIf your knife is wider or narrower than 1.5 inches, measure the height from 1.5 inches back from the edge, otherwise the math doesn\u0092t work. It\u0092s the height/width ratio that gives you the angle.\nForget the math. In a pinch a large binder clip clamped to the spine will get you pretty close.\nSo, let\u0092s get started:\n1) Establish your 15 degree angle. If you\u0092re using a Sharpmaker, put the stones in the 15 degree slots. With a Lansky, Gatco or EdgePro system, slide the rod into the 15 degree setting. With edge guides, clamp the guide at the 3/8\u0094 height. Freehanding, raise the spine to 3/8 inch measured 1.5 inches back from the edge.\nNow you\u0092re ready to create a burr. Be patient, this might take a while. To grind off the shoulders of the previous edge we\u0092re going to be removing a lot of metal. That\u0092s why we need the coarse stone. At this point it doesn\u0092t really matter what kind of stroke you use. You can go heel to tip or just grind in circles. It doesn\u0092t make any difference.\nTo keep the aesthetics of the knife, you\u0092ll want the bevels relatively even on each side. If you just grind one side until you get a burr, the other side will require much less grinding. Thus the bevels will be mismatched. To keep them matched, grind one side for about five minutes or so then switch to the other side, maintaining your approximately 15 degree angle. Feel the knife every so often to see if you can feel a burr. Keep grinding and switching sides until you detect a burr beginning to form. Remember, the burr forms on the side opposite from the side you are grinding. If you don\u0092t remember how to check for a burr, see the picture earlier in the tutorial.\nAs soon as you detect a burr, keep grinding on the current side until the burr runs the entire length of the opposite edge.\nIf you use the Magic Marker Trick described below, you can save a little time on this step.\n2) Repeat on the opposite side until you feel a burr along the full edge of the first side.\n3) Optional: If you want to dress up the scratch pattern, switch to your fine stone and give the edge several passes on each side (at the same angle) to polish them out a little.\n4) Establish your 20 degree angle. If you\u0092re using a Sharpmaker, switch to the 20 degree slots. With a Lansky, Gatco or EdgePro system, simply change the rod to the 20 degree setting. With edge guides unclamp the guide and slide it forward about an 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Freehanding, raise the spine another 1/8 inch. If you switched to your fine stone, switch back to your coarse stone or the next one up, usually a medium stone.\n5) Create a burr again at the new sharpening angle, going back to side one. This time you\u0092re grinding the edges to meet at a 20 degree angle. This will happen very quickly because you\u0092ve already removed most of the metal you need to. The 20 primary edge face will be very narrow compared to the 15 degree back bevel, somewhere around 1/32 to 1/64 of an inch.\n6) Switch sides and repeat until you have a burr running the full length of the first side.\n7) You\u0092re almost home. Now that you\u0092ve got your burr you need to grind it off completely so that the true edge remains. Now technique matters. No more grinding in circles. Stroke gently from heel to tip, alternating sides with each stroke. Keep the sharpening stone perpendicular to the blade as usual, beginning the stroke at the heel and ending at the tip. Or if you are sharpening on a benchstone, stroke tip to heel, if you\u0092re more comfortable that way. Lighten up on the pressure as you go. There is no hard and fast rule, but five to 10 strokes per side should do it. If your checking reveals that the burr is simply flopping from side to side, lighten up the pressure even more.\n8) Change from the coarse or medium stone to the fine stone and continue. Keep stroking side to side until all the scratches from the coarse stone are gone. Continue lightening up on the pressure as you proceed. You are trying to grind the burr off. If you press too hard you\u0092ll simply form another one.\n9) Finish with a few very light strokes on the fine stone. Now, to make sure that the burr is completely gone, place the knife on the stone as though you were going to take one last stroke, but this time increase the angle just a hair. On a Sharpmaker, tilt the knife very, very slightly in toward the center to increase the angle. Now guide the knife down the stone using no more pressure than the weight of the knife itself. Switch sides and repeat for one stroke. You can do this for one more stroke per side if you can still feel any vestige of a burr.\nIf you have a smooth steel or very fine grit ceramic rod you can substitute a couple of strokes per side at a slightly greater than 20 degree angle for this last step (see discussion on steels and steeling below).\nYour edge should be frighteningly sharp at this point. If it\u0092s not, you might not have fully ground off the burr. The edge could simply be turned to one side. Try the fine stone and light pressure again. It could also be that rather than grinding off the burr it was simply turned straight down. This will give you an edge that will send shivers down your spine but it will break off in the first use. A light touch at the end of the sharpening process is the key.\nIf you want your knife too look as good as it performs, progress through the coarse, medium and fine stones at each angle setting while you\u0092re raising your burr. This will remove any deep scratches and give the edge a more refined look.\nThis edge is not only very sharp, but is relatively strong. With regular steeling it will last for many months, even under hard use. When steeling ceases to have the desired effect it\u0092s time to sharpen again. However, now that you\u0092ve ground the back bevel you really only need to sharpen the 20 degree primary edge. If your knife is very dull go back to step four on the coarse stones. If it is only a little dull you can begin with the fine stones. The burr will be very easy to raise in subsequent sharpening sessions.\nTips and Tricks\nThere are a couple of tricks that can make the sharpening process even easier. I\u0092ve saved them until the end just to be cruel.\nThe Magic Marker Trick\nOne of the easiest ways to ensure that you are matching an existing bevel is to coat the edge with magic marker. As the magic marker is abraded away by the sharpening stone. you will be able to see where the metal is being removed and whether you have matched the angle properly. Once you have coated both bevels with marker, take a swipe or two down your stone. If the marker is wiped off over the width of the bevel you have matched the angle properly. If your angle is too high, only the marker near the very edge will be removed. If your angle is too low only the marker near the shoulder, above the edge, will be removed. Recoating the edge as you sharpen is a good way to ensure that you\u0092re holding the correct angle throughout the process. No matter what type of sharpening system you use, the magic marker trick will save you a lot of time and frustration, especially in matching an unknown angle on one of the guide or rod-style systems.\nThe magic marker trick also comes in handy when you are establishing a back bevel. If you coat the edge before working at the 15 degree setting you can grind the back bevel until the marker is ground almost to the edge, leaving 1/32 to 1/64 inch. That\u0092s about how wide the primary edge face will be. Rather than grinding all the way to the edge until you get a burr, you can now switch to the 20 degree setting, knowing that the last little bit of edge will become the primary edge face. You still have to raise a burr at 20 degrees, but the marker trick can save you a little time.\nThe Paper Airplane Trick\nTake a piece of paper with square edges. Fold the bottom left corner over until it meets the right edge. Smooth it down. You\u0092ve just turned a 90 degree angle into a 45 degree angle. Fold the creased edge over to the far right edge like you\u0092re making a paper airplane. You\u0092ve just folded it in half again, and you have a 22.5 degree angle. Sound familiar? Twenty-two and a half degrees is pretty dang close to 20 degrees. As close as you can generally hold a specific angle by hand. This folded piece of paper can serve as a guide for steeling your knife, setting an angle on a benchstone or just checking that you\u0092re keeping your angle steady as you sharpen. The paper edge guide is especially handy when you are learning to steel your knives properly. It helps build the right angle into muscle memory so you can do it without the guide when you have a little more experience. Fold the paper again and you have an 11.25 degree guide for steeling those super thin slicing knives that you\u0092ve sharpened to 10 degrees per side.\nThe Mousepad Trick\nDo you have an old mouse pad? Is there an auto supply store nearby? You can make a superb sharpening system for about $5.\nGo to your nearest auto supply store and get some 600 grit sandpaper. Mylar-backed wet/dry sandpaper works best. This is the stuff used to sand automotive paint between coats. Get the self-stick kind. If they have higher grits, get a couple of sheets of those, too, 1200 grit is generally the next step up. Go nuts. It\u0092s cheap.\nStick the sandpaper to the mouse pad and trim the edges. This is your new sharpening system. If you have both 600 and 1200 grit, apply one to each side of the mousepad. Make sure you have a work surface you don\u0092t mind scratching up. If you have a double-sided mousepad sharpener, you don\u0092t want to work on your kitchen counter or dining room table. Your spouse will kill you.\nThis system requires a stropping motion when sharpening, using an edge-trailing stroke. That means that unlike other sharpening methods you don\u0092t lead with the edge, you lead with the spine. Image an old barbershop with the barber stropping his razor, stroking away from the edge. That\u0092s the idea.\nTo establish your angle, lay the knife flat on the pad, edge toward you. Lift the spine slightly while pulling lightly toward you. Continue lifting until the edge bites into the sandpaper. That\u0092s your stropping angle.\nPress down lightly and stroke the knife away from you, spine first, moving from heel to tip. When you reach the end STOP and lift the knife straight up off the sandpaper. Don\u0092t roll it off or lift the spine further or you\u0092ll mess up the edge you\u0092re creating. Turn the knife over and stroke back the other way with the edge away from you, pulling the spine toward you at the same angle as the previous stroke. The really cool thing is that the mouse pad is soft enough that it conforms to the angle of the knife edge. As long as you\u0092re pretty close you\u0092ll be fine. This will give you an amazing edge in a fairly short amount of time. If you want to polish it up, use the higher grit sandpaper on the other side of the mouse pad.\nBecause the mousepad is soft, it deforms lightly around the edge of the knife and gives you a slightly convex bevel. As we\u0092ve discussed, a convex edge has many advantages but can be difficult to achieve without a belt sander. This is one way to create or maintain a convex edge without serious power tools.\nThis is the same technique as stropping (below) but with a different abrasive.\nStropping\nStropping is a handy way to finish off a burr or put a final mirror polish on your edge. While you can strop on anything from the back of a legal pad to an old belt, places like Lee Valley Tools and HandAmerican sell hard backed strops. The strop is usually charged with an abrasive, like green chromium oxide paste, so it actually does remove very fine particles of metal.\nLike the mousepad trick above, stropping is an edge trailing stroke. Lay your knife flat on the strop with the spine facing away from you. Slowly pull the knife toward you while lifting the spine. When the edge just begins to bite into the leather you have found your angle. Keep that angle as you stroke the spine away from you, pulling the edge along behind. When you get to the end of the stroke STOP. Lift the blade straight up off the strop. Do not lift the edge higher or roll the knife over while it is still on the strop. You can wreck your edge that way.\nNow lay the knife flat again, spine toward you, and gently push the edge toward the end of the strop while lifting the spine. When the edge begins to bite you\u0092ve found your angle for the return stroke. This second step isn\u0092t really necessary if you\u0092ve kept your angles consistent during sharpening, but it never hurts to make sure you are holding the right angle. The return stroke is the same motion as the first stroke, simply in reverse. The edge is facing away from you and you pull the spine toward you.\nStropping will create an extremely sharp, highly polished edge optimized for push cutting. To some extent, stropping can make up for less than perfect sharpening technique, especially since it\u0092s a little more forgiving.\nHandling Serrated Knives\nSerrated knives and bread knives are a special case. Serrated knives will stay sharp longer than plain edged knives, mainly because the insides of the serrations generally don\u0092t contact hard surfaces. That\u0092s what the teeth are for. The teeth not only have a cutting function, but are also sacrificial lambs, offered up to steakhouse swordsman and children everywhere who feel that if they\u0092re not grinding into the ceramic of the plate, they\u0092re not cutting.\nThere are four ways to sharpen serrated knives:\n1) Pretend the serrations don\u0092t exist and sharpen on a stone, sharpening system or electric sharpener as you would a plain edged knife. This will eventually remove the serrations.\n2) Sharpen the flat, non-serrated back of the blade. This will sharpen the knife, but also will eventually remove the serrations, though not as quickly as the first method.\n3) Sharpen the serrations individually with a tapered diamond or ceramic file.\n4) Sharpen on a crock stick setup, going very slowly so the ceramic rod glides in and out of the serrations.\nThis last method actually works fairly well, especially with the Spyderco Sharpmaker. It\u0092s triangular rods fit into serrations much easier than the standard round crock sticks. If you want to keep your serrated knives as sharp as they can be, the Sharpmaker system is the way to go, though the Lansky rod-guided system also has an accessory hone for sharpening serrated edges.\nChisel Ground Edges\nSharpening chisel-ground or single-bevel knives is not tricky. You simply match the bevel angle and sharpen as usual \u0096 but only on the beveled side. When you raise a burr, grind it off by laying the flat side of the knife perfectly flat against your stone and swipe the burr off. It only takes a couple of passes. You can do the same thing with a strop. The back side of the knife must be perfectly flat or you\u0092ll round your edge. All you want to do is grind off the burr.\nThe back side of a sashimi knife is sometimes lightly hollow ground to make this step easier. You can actually lay the knife flat and sharpen with your usual stroke, edge first across the stone.\nHow to Tell if Your Knife is Sharp\nHow do you know when you have achieved the ultimate high performance edge? Depends on what you want to do with it. Remember that we defined sharp not only as two edge faces intersecting at a line of minimum width, but also as a function of blade shape, angle and the material to be cut. We want a keen edge that can hold up in repeated usage while producing the results we\u0092re looking for in the kitchen.\nYou can tell when you\u0092ve set your knife\u0092s edge bevels correctly by placing the knife at a 30-45 degree angle on your thumbnail and pulling across the edge. A properly set edge will bite in and not slip off your nail. Of course, you could hurt yourself doing this, too. Or, at the very least, wreck your nail polish.\nAny slick, slightly rounded surface will do. Take, for example, a plastic pen, stand it at a 30-45 degree angle on a countertop and lay the knife edge straight up and down on the plastic. Pull the edge from heel to tip. If it bites in, you\u0092ve set your edge correctly. If it slides off, you have some more work to do. The sharper the blade, the smaller you can make the angle before it slips.\nAnother test is to take a Q-tip and push the fuzzy head over the edge. Any nicks or burrs will pull the cotton fibers loose from the head. The Q-tip will also reveal any rough spots in the edge. A well-sharpened edge will feel smooth. This test is more effective for polished edges.\nRazor Edge Systems makes an Edge Tester for this very purpose. It is widely used in the meat cutting industry to check edges to see if they need sharpening (or if the meat cutter is just goofing off).\nAnother check is the \u0093Samurai Hair Test.\u0094 Lay the knife nearly flat against the hair on the back of your head and pull gently down. Very gently. An aggressive, keen edge will readily grab the hair. A dull edge will simply slide off. Don\u0092t shave the back of your head. Just pull gently down to see if the edge catches and tugs. I don\u0092t want any irate calls from your barber or hairstylist.\nThe classic test of sharpening is shaving the hair of your arms. This has several problems, not the least of which is that the hair might not grow back or could come in coarser and darker than the surrounding hair. And if you have a lot of knives to test you\u0092ll end up looking like you have mange.\nThe real problem with shaving, though, is that shaving is push cutting. A highly polished edge will readily push cut, but, as we\u0092ve discovered, you don\u0092t always want a highly polished edge. A slightly coarse edge that tugs the hair but doesn\u0092t shave will actually slice better than the polished edge. Thus, shaving isn\u0092t the best test for many knives.\nThere are other opinions on shaving as a test. Cliff Stamp said, \u0093Coarse edges can easily shave, Joe Talmadge was one of the first guys to comment on this. A lot of people think they can't and thus sharpen them pretty sloppily. The more coarse an edge you form, the sloppier you can get and still have decent cutting ability. However you can get better cutting ability but keeping the edge crisp and aligned. This edge will then have a much higher level of push cutting ability, overall durability and edge retention, as well as a slightly higher level of slicing aggression. I have seen edges formed from a 100 grit AO belt that would still shave. This is more coarse than a x-coarse DMT hone.\u0094\nSlicing newsprint is a pretty good test. Both highly polished edges and toothier edges (as long as they\u0092re not overly coarse) will readily slice a piece of newspaper held lightly between your fingers.\nThe best test, though, is actually using the knife for its intended purpose. If you have a slicing knife, try a soft tomato or plum. A keen, toothy edge can bite into the tomato with little or no pressure, just a light draw across the skin. If you have polished your santoku to a mirror-like edge, try dicing a few carrots or potatoes. The reduced effort will be immediately noticeable. And greatly appreciated if you have 50 pounds of beets to get through before service.\nA thin, slightly coarse slicing knife will cut a soft tomato with a light pull and nearly no pressure on the blade.\n"}, {"score": 282.57822, "uuid": "00adae45-97d8-5e7e-8c0f-bf00f6b672d3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0502wb-14-13002", "target_hostname": "www.cheftalk.com", "target_uri": "http://www.cheftalk.com/t/63843/new-to-cheftalk-looking-for-a-new-knife", "page_rank": 1.2233943e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "new to ChefTalk, looking for a new knife", "snippet": "I&#x27;m not 100% certain <em>I</em> want to go to Japanese <em>steel</em>. <em>I</em> do have some sharpening skills, but not with Japanese water stones.

I'm Michael and\u00a0new to this forum; stumbled across it searching for info on knives. I've only just found this place and have done some looking at older threads, so please bear with me as I get to know my way around and what has already been discussed!\nI've been a serious home cook for 20+ years since college, and a private chef for the past couple. I've gotten by with an ad hoc collection of knives. For the past 8 years or so, a Wusthof 12\" Classic has been my main knife. I got it at a cutlery store close-out - I wasn't really looking for a knife that big, but it's certainly awesome! Now that I'm doing more and more\u00a0cooking, it's time to move on...\nI'm not 100% certain I want to go to Japanese steel. I do have some sharpening skills, but not with Japanese water stones. Mostly I've sharpened my knives w/ inexpensive oil stones, ceramic rods and a steel. I can set a pretty sharp edge on most of my knives, especially the 12\". I've been happy w/ German steel up until now, but I'm realizing a sharper knife may be to my liking - and definitely lighter!\nWhat I like about German steel is the all-purpose durability and ease of maintenance and sharpening. I'm intrigued by the harder Japanese steel and steeper edge angles, and the sharpness they can achieve.\nCompletely on the fence about handle style of riveted western vs round/D-shaped Japanese (Wa?).\nAt the moment I'm looking to upgrade my main chef's knife, with a few others to follow, like a paring knife, 6\" slicing/utility knife, etc.\nI'm leaning towards a riveted handle; doesn't necessarily have to be western though, and this is not a deal killer\nA knife with some heft and not too fragile, too light, too bendy or whippy\nsomething hard, but not impossible to sharpen, not like a 65RC; maybe something like 61-64?\na 10\" / 270mm\nI'm not too attached to any brand, but I would like to get as many knives from the same company/line for consistency (plus I'm finicky like that)\nI do have some sharpening skills, and I'm not opposed to getting into some good Japanese water stones and new tourniquets\nI like stainless for the ease of care, but do not have to have it - would be nice bonus if other factors are there\nBrands I've considered (I've read some posts by DBL that have been extremely informative - thanks in advance!);\nShun - not opposed to them, but not at all attached; I've fondled a coupe and haven't been overly impressed\nShun Elite - I've actually ordered a couple and are on their way.

Thanks in advance for any help and opinions! Cheers!!! mpp\nBDL will probably be along soon to give you advice -- betcha he plumps for the MAC -- but I do have two remarks here about your general questions.\n1. Handles\nIt doesn't matter much, really. There are only a couple of good grips to use, and none of them really gets into the handle, so it ends up being largely aesthetic. I switched from Western to Japanese-style handles when I was in Japan, and was very surprised to find that I barely noticed. The one place I for one would hold out for the Western handle no matter what is with a paring/petty knife, because one is often holding that really by the handle, up off the board, and Japanese handles can twist on you a hair more easily. Since you don't seem to have much of a preference, I'd suggest dropping this from the equation.\n2. Durability\nWith double-beveled knives, there are, among Japanese knives, basically three types: garbage, good, and \"laser.\" You don't want the first, obviously. The \"laser\" thing refers to knives that are ludicrously thin, almost anorexic. That has some advantages, but durability isn't one of them. Otherwise, if you get a good knife, sharpen it appropriately, and use it appropriately, durability is far less of an issue than you think. (Everyone has this confusion, initially, it's not just you.) Frankly, these knives are quite tough -- they just don't seem like they could be, because they're so light. That's an illusion.\nThere are some techniques about which you will need to be mildly careful, which may or may not mean changing your arsenal. If you mince piles of herbs in the classic French manner, holding the tip down and guillotine-ing up and down with the handle, rotating the knife around the curve of the tip as you go, you may find a problem: specifically, the curve of the tip will embed itself in the board and then, as you rotate, will pick up micro-chips. There are three solutions: stop using this method, use a much tougher knife for this one technique, or learn a very light touch. In general, I think the third is the right answer, because I do not think most people should plan to make dramatic changes in technique to suit new equipment, but should rather buy equipment that suits their technique (assuming, of course, that the technique in question is basically decent). But personally I've actually completely changed all my technique, from soup to nuts, to suit wildly different equipment than I used to use. So, whatever.\nYou must be very careful around bone, but principally for the same reason. It's not hitting bone that will screw up these knives -- they're tough -- it's twisting. What these knives really don't like is crosswise force at the edge.\nMy recommendation would be to keep that Wustie as your chef de chef, i.e. your brutality knife, then buy a 270mm gyuto. A decent petty knife to back that up and you're in business.\nBut I'll let BDL tell you which brands....\nSelect All Posts By This User\nThanks for the info, CL!\nAs you described, that's how I do most of my chopping/slicing - tip on the board w/ a rocking motion. I use a rotating slicing action for most of this type of work, not a straight up-and-down chopping like a\u00a0paper cutter - the knife cuts better when a slicing motion is added to the chopping motion. Since I'm used to such a big heavy knife, I know I'll have to change some of my techniques/habits w/ J-steel. I know the J-steel doesn't like twisting, but didn't know about the edge micro-chipping from a tip down rocking motion - I will take extra care on that!\u00a0Just not sure I want to radically change all of my techniques. Someday I'll put a laser in my kit, and for that, sure, I'll use it appropriately.\nA couple of concerns re: handles. First is durability of construction. When I see a handle with a full tang and rivets, I think that it will never become loose. I can't imagine though, that a traditional Japanese handle of good craftsmanship will ever come loose, despite the rattlings in my head. The other concern is with the grip - with my 12\" W, if I grab it too for forward of the handle the base of my index finger will hit a squared off part of the knife where it transitions into the spine, and if I have a big job to do w/ lots of cutting/chopping/slicing I'll get a blister. Maybe in part due to poor technique. Or that it a large heavy knife that needs a lot of force. I'm concerned w/ J-knife handle and a pinch grip that I'll be getting more of the same issue. Maybe I should just change my technique to suit the tool... Thanks again! mpp\nSelect All Posts By This User\nI just wrote a long reply which my stupid mousepad-bug managed to delete for me ;P But in short, any of the knife brands you've picked out manufactures truely good knives. And on the handle side of things, picking out the right for you is impossible for us. You have to go out and try the knives yourself for that\nAnd im pretty sure you'll adapt your technique to the new lightness and\u00a0 sharpness of a knife pretty fast.\nSelect All Posts By This User\nHandles: don't sweat it. If the handle is seated right, it won't come off, and you're talking about good manufacturers who aren't going to sell you mis-seated handles. Whether you'll like the handles is another matter.\nTechnique: these knives are a great deal tougher than you'd think. Don't agonize. Don't change your technique immediately, just think \"light touch, light touch, light touch.\" If you still get microchipping, then, yes, start thinking about what you want to do -- change technique, change knives, or what?\nBlister: a chef acquaintance of mine in Kyoto, a guy who basically scored 2.9 Michelin stars (they actually told him he was right on the edge of three and ought to push just that little bit harder for next time around), told me that the true mark of a kaiseki chef is a callus on the middle finger in between the lowest two knuckles (i.e. the part closest to the hand). That's because when you hold an usuba correctly -- which every kaiseki chef does about half of his life -- that part of the finger is jammed hard up against the knife. You're not using an usuba, fortunately, but perhaps the principle is worth considering.\nSelect All Posts By This User\nHere's a brief update;\nI got the Shun Elite chef knife in, along with a couple others, and didn't like it. There are some nice features about it, but more features about it that I didn't like it enough to keep it. Basically, I thought the handle design was a little clunky; however, I did like the bolster design in how it was curved for the fingers and it was one piece of the outer layers of steel, rather than being two separate pieces welded onto each side of the blade. The shape of the chef's knife was as BDL describes - an awkward version of a German style blade w/ too much curve for my taste on the bottom edge. I've come to the conclusion\u00a0 that Shun knives are over-hyped over-expensive Japanese-style\u00a0knives designed for mass market appeal. Not bad knives at all, but not what I'm looking for.\nI've since order the Hattori Forum JCK FH 270 gyuto from JCK\u00a0and the Blazen 270 gyuto from EE. Very excited about both, but will only be able to keep one. I'm leaning towards the FH due to the handle design, but I'll in person soon. Very excited!\nIn the meantime, I've been playing w/ a Moritaka 270 kiritsuke from CKTG. It's san-mai construction w/ AS steel. First impression are - WOWWWWWW!!!!! I'm so not used to a knife like this! It's nearly polar opposite the 12\" W I've been using and have become accustomed to. It's so much sharper and lighter, and the shape and handle are completely new to me. It was sharp OOTB, but I lightly put it on a fine oil stone I have and a few light passes on my new MAC black ceramic steel and the edge is quite good - will cut hair but not give a close shave. I'm going through a big learning curve on using a knife like this - I love it so much, and am willing to change and adopt some new techniques suited to this type of knife.\nOne of the biggest differences is the handle - I've never used a Wa handle before, and it's interested. Overall I think I prefer a western handle (which is why I'm really looking forward to the Hattori FH). Since the Moritaka kirit is lighter and nimbler, I don't have to grip it so hard, which is nice. I'm just not used to holding the knife so far up on the handle to get a pinch grip on the blade with the thumb and fore finger, and it feels a bit awkward but at the same time it feels like what it most practical.\nSelect All Posts By This User\nThe Hattori FH is a beautiful knife with near perfect ergonomics.\u00a0 I think you'll like it very much.\u00a0 The Blazen will almost certainly exhibit superior edge retention vs the Hattori.\u00a0 I have to agree with you re the Shun Elite...just not worth it.\u00a0 The fit and finish is great and the knife is well made but the design is all \"wrong.\"\u00a0 The Moritaka \"kiritsuke\" is an interesting one; it's not a true Kiritsuke (they're double beveled) but shaped like one with a 50/50 edge.\u00a0 While I haven't used that one I did get to spend some time using a 270mm Moritaka gyuto and I fell in love with it.\u00a0 It was thin, light & beautiful and the Aogami core takes a superb edge.\u00a0 If you work diligently on sharpening it will give you an edge that's quite likely to be superior to anything you've ever seen before.\nSelect All Posts By This User\nThanks for the feedback Phaedrus!\u00a0I realize the Moritaka kiritsuke is not a true kiritsuke since it's got a double bevel, but that's fine by me.

Is it because of the SG2 steel being harder than the VG-10 steel?\nEven in the last few days of waiting delivery of the SS knifes and playing around w/ the carbon Moritaka, I'm not really interested in SS anymore. The more I read and learn, it seems real blade fanatics are fans of carbon steel, and I'm starting to see why. Maintenance is not an issue for me - I have always meticulously cleaned and cared for my knives; I'm more interested in the performance of the blade's ability to take and hold an edge, and how it feels in my hand.\nSaying that, I'm now thinking I want a carbon steel knife w/ a western handle. I use a pinch grip, but hold my thumb and forefinger around the bolster, not on the blade. I'm a little awkward using the wa handle on the Moritaka. When I picked up the Blazen today it felt familiar and comfortable. I'm not opposed to adapting to a wa handle, this is just where I'm at at the moment... and that may change again in a few days...\nSelect All Posts By This User\nSo here's a couple questions about steels and knives;\nAny recommendations on a 270 gyuto carbon w/a\u00a0 western handle? That's somewhat reasonable, say under $400? So far I'm come up with the Hiromoto Tenmi Jyuraku Aogami Super Series f/ JCK. The CarboNext isn't hard enough... I'm looking for something hard now...\nI'm confused about Aogami Super Steel and it's hardness. Some inconsistencies from site to site and maker to maker. I know there are different grades with different hardnesses. For instance; Mark @ CKTG states that the Moritaka knives (both the kuroichi and Damascus) knives are made from the high end AS w/ a hardness of 65. JCK says the Hiromoto AS are HRC62-63. On zknives.com, he states that Aogami Super is HRC61, Aogami 1 & 2 seem to both be HRC65 with 1 having better wear resistance and 2 being tougher. Can anyone shed some light?\nI think I'm willing to give up on the western handle in order to get something like AS HRC65 at a reasonable price... the Moritaka knives are very nice, super sharp, hard steel, and they offer several different styles and sizes that I'm looking for, without breaking the bank...\nSelect All Posts By This User\nThere is no single inherent hardness level for any given steel.\u00a0 Nearly all have a relatively wide hardness range to which they can be taken by varying temperatures and quench.\u00a0 Obviously there are tradeoffs to be made; too hard and a steel may be brittle, or fragile.\u00a0 Aogami seems to be pretty successful at fulfilling it's role when hardened up til at least 64 RC.\u00a0 That said, I don't think there's any reason to get overly obsessed with the number listed.\u00a0 Hardness is a factor in the performance of a steel but hardly the only one- maybe not even the most important.\nSelect All Posts By This User\nWas reading on your concerns with HRC ratings and wanted to comment as I had let this become an overwhelming thought for myself as well.\nA few things I learned in relation to hardness is that not every single knife of the same model will have exactly the same hardness (should be close, but it can vary), not every mfg gets the same performance from a similar HRC rating because how they harden and the actual steel used can have a larger effect on performance than the actual hardness etc\nSomething that is also confusing is that it is seeming to be difficult to compare \"specs\" on J knives because there are so many factors involved it just does not seem to work. An example is how moly steel blades that are slightly softer than say VG10 can not only often be easier to sharpen \"properly\" but also more forgiving in respect to micro chipping. They may not be as hard, and not hold an edge as long, but still get razor sharp, and will stay that way a long time, but you will not have as many concerns with chipping from unintentional or even intentional twisting on the board.\nIt also is seeming to be that everything here is just like most things in life in that there are trade offs. Too soft has it share of problems and benefits, and so does too hard as well. Another poster had made a great point about the best all around blade may very well be one with a mid graded HRC as it would still have enough hardness to take a good edge while not having as strong of a concern for chipping etc.\u00a0 The more time I spend with my new J knives the more I am understanding this.\nI am very interested in your thoughts on the Hattori when you receive it as that model is currently on my short list for when I upgrade or add to the collection so please let us know what you think.\nQuote:\nOriginally Posted by carvingtool\nThanks for the feedback Phaedrus!\u00a0I realize the Moritaka kiritsuke is not a true kiritsuke since it's got a double bevel, but that's fine by me.

I am not really sure I need the added benefit any more than $200+ Hattori, but every time I see any of you praising the carbons it just raises my curiosity etc.\nSounds like you already found your preference in handles, and that can help you to narrow down future decisions as it cuts the herd pretty much almost in half. When I was going through this about a month and a half ago I did the same as it was just too much with all the different steels, profiles, designs, price levels and the like.\nQuote:\nIn the meantime, I've been playing w/ a Moritaka 270 kiritsuke from CKTG.

Yes just think of that!!\nThe others here were great in helping me to better understand properly sharpening J knives, and I am sure they will be a big help for you as well. Just be prepared to be surprising yourself with what you thought was sharp in the past, and the edge you will be able to produce in the future, and then improve on that etc.\nSounds like you are getting in enough very different knives to allow yourself to be able to get a feel for the different styles, profiles, steels etc and this is a great thing because it allows to compare and really know your happy with your final decisions.\nLooking forward to hearing your comparisons etc.\nCarving Tool --\nYou've got a lot of good questions -- some of which are very general interest.\nThere are a lot of very good choices at far less than the top of your price range, and the knives get better still (although a fewer on the ground) as you approach it.\nI doubt you'd realize any practical advantages at RCH 65 as opposed to 60-61; but am interested in what you think they might be.\u00a0 I smell\u00a0 \"teaching moment,\" one useful for a lot of people who lurk here.\nThere is no \"right\" hardness for Aogami Super; and you can't trust manufacturers to report the numbers in a way which allows valid comparison.\u00a0 61-62ish is\u00a0pretty good for most AS knives.\nAs long as he's using something good, the knife maker has a lot more to do with the quality of the knife than the particular alloy.\u00a0 If you're looking for\u00a0carbon, there's no need to restrict yourself to AS.\u00a0 There are great knives made in\u00a0both whites, all three blues, and at least one of the Swedish carbons -- not to mention the tool steels.\u00a0 In fact, if you're looking for something very hard and tough you might want to consider one of the wa-handled, tsuchime, Yoshikane knives -- even though it's semi-stainless and not carbon.\nYou really have to figure out whether you're going yo or wa.\u00a0 There are plenty of great knives either way.\u00a0 For yo-carbon, the Masamoto HC (probably V2C steel) is very good; The Tadatsuna White #2 is still better -- and might well be the very best carbon yo-gyuto at any price; and the Misono Sweden is just a step below but a heckuva lot cheaper.\u00a0 For wa-carbon, the Masamoto KS is as good as a gyuto gets.\u00a0\u00a0Takeda is very good and so is Moritaka.\u00a0 But, if you like lasers, the Tadatsuna White #2, and the Konoskue White #2 are also excellent.\nSetting you up with the knife which best matches your desires shouldn't be too difficult.\nBDL\nHey BDL - thanks for jumping in on this thread. I've read a lot of you replies in other threads, and I really appreciate your input!\nHere's an update... and it got long winded...\nAfter more time w/ the Moritaka 270 kiritsuke, I now realize it's not a true replacement for a gyuto/chef's knife. I also realize it's not a true kiritsuke since it's 50/50 bevel, more of a western-gyuto-styled kiritsuke. It doesn't have much of a curve to the blade edge, therefore it's not very good for any type of rocking motion. It's got a little curve at the tip, so the handle can be lifted off the board w/ the tip down a little bit, but lift the handle too high and the tip bites into the board. I'm getting used to using a blade w/ such a straight edge, but I'm finding it's got it's niche. Still love it though!\nNeedless to say, I've been obsessing over knives for some time now... researching and reading more trying to get a hold on who makes what with what for what price...\nI received the Hattori FH - still in the box, unused. First impressions are it's extremely well made and BEAUTIFUL! I've run the knife on the board for a couple of light passes along side the Blazen, and I can immediately tell the difference between a single steel blade and a san-mai blade - I much prefer the liveliness and feed-back of the single steel blade. Not that I dislike the san-mai blades, maybe it's the after using German steel for so long the FH feels more familiar. Regardless, I'm now leaning towards a single-steel blade, and that narrows my search down even more. As I understand it, from BDL and others on the internets, Hattori makes VG-10 as good as it can get.\nThe Blazen feels a little bit like a German knife, but with less feed back - it's feels large and solid with a handle that you can take a firm grip on. The FH feels lighter and nimbler in the hand - more precise. I really appreciate the shape of the FH blade - it shows that a lot of thought went into it's design. On the Blazen, the back end of the blade it perfectly flat, while on the FH the heel has a very slight upward curve. This gives each knife a very different feel on the board in a push-cut; the Blazen feel has more of an abrupt transition from the downward slicing motion to the forward forward motion; the FH seems to be smoother due the upward curve in the heel. Both are beautiful, but very different.\nMaybe the only thing I don't like about the FH is that it's got a lot of sharp corners. The steel bolster has flat edges as opposed to the inward curving edges on the Blaze; the top of the spine and choil\u00a0are dead square right angles, where as the Blazen is very nicely rounded. Not a deal breaker to me, but I can see after a long cutting session those edge could raises some blisters. The crisp edges show off the precision and quality of fabrication, but honestly do not seem practical to me.\nI've also come to realize that the ultimate hardness is not the ultimate factor in the blade; how the maker works with the steel has more to do with the knife's performance. From what I've read, it\u00a0 seems that White Steel will take a sharper edge than Blue steel, but Blue Steel will retain it's edge better.\u00a0The reason I'm drawn to Aogami Super Steel is edge retention and resistance to chipping for it's hardness. I'm still not too clear on who uses what steel, particularly when blue steel is discussed. As far as I understand, there is Blue #1, Blue #2 and Blue Super; who uses what is sometimes a mystery to me as some sellers/makers simply refer to the steel as Blue. White steel seems to be more clearly defined.\nAfter having used the Moritaka AS blade for it's first dinner party, the benefits of stainless are more apparent than ever. I was very careful to wipe the blade after each use and not leave it wet or with acid on it. Still, it had faint rust on it rather quickly. That came off with a light scrubbing so it doesn't seem to be a big deal. But if I'm cooking for clients and cranking along, I'm not going to have the time or mind set to wipe and dry the blade after every cutting job. That's not to say that I'm ruling out carbon over stainless, but stainless is now more in the picture.\nHandles I'm still up in the air on, but I really like the feel of the FH. I guess I'm more interested in the blade performance regardless of the handle - I'll happily use either if the blade is what I want. BDL's recommendations have really caught my attention - the Masamoto KS looks like it's simply magnificent, and the Konosuke HD and Tadatsuna White #2 are intriguing options as well because they are (I believe) single steel blades. I'm more inclined to have one of these over the Blazen. I can't seem to find a Tadatsuna White Steel #2 w/ a yo-handle... \u00a0If I could drop the coin, I think I'd go for a honyaki AS knife, not sure from who... maybe this Monzaburo? If Hattori ever does the Forum designed knives in Cowry-X that could be orgasmic!\nQuote:\nThere are a lot of very good choices at far less than the top of your price range, and the knives get better still (although a fewer on the ground) as you approach it.\nOK - I'm all ears!\n"}, {"score": 276.97034, "uuid": "65ef3fb6-a536-5b9c-8ab1-c11585ec02a6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1909wb-93-31337", "target_hostname": "jugalbandi.info", "target_uri": "http://jugalbandi.info/2009/11/gifts-for-the-foodiephotographerfitness-freak/", "page_rank": 1.2007261e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Gifts for the foodie/photographer/fitness freak | jugalbandi", "snippet": "<em>I</em> <em>should</em> go and check the websites now!

Majority of the peelers I&#x27;ve seen so far are much worse.", "explanation": null, "document": "Home > Knives > Kitchen Knives > Peeler Reviews\nIn case you are wondering how did a mere peeler end up on my website, in knives section, I'll have to say that the peeler is one of the most underappreciated, yet intensively used and abused, very useful cutlery item. Phew. I figure that summarizes it :) Seriously. I donno about you, but with all my passion and interest in knives I hate peeling potatoes, apples and anything else for that matter with a knife. So daunting. Peeler, on the other hand does the job a lot faster, efficiently, less efforts and so on. Besides it is a knife in a way. If you check Webster for the definition of a knife, it says a cutting instrument consisting of a sharp blade fastened to a handle;. Sounds exactly like a peeler to me. Anyway, enough about that. Let's get to Crosswise. I got it together with another kitchen knives, and it was a lucky buy as it turned out later. I'll describe details below.\nGeneral\n- Rosle's Crosswise peeler is well designed and made tool. Sturdy, pretty versatile for a peeler. Majority of the peelers I've seen so far are much worse. That applies to all aspects, quality and design, and functionality. Although, as usual you get what you pay for :) If an average peeler out there costs anywhere from 2$ to 7$ for kindda good one, and Kyocera Ceramic peelers have hefty price tag of 12$ slapped on them(discounted BTW, MSRP is higher, 17$ or so), Crosswise costs 20$(also discounted ;). Nevertheless, that was one of my best buys for my kitchen, and one of the most useful cutters in there.\nPeeler features brushed stainless steel handle to improve grip, and polished stainless sleet blade and business end, apparently to improve friction properties, i.e. reduce it. Overall, no complaints from me regarding either quality or functionality. Does exactly what a good peeler should do, and doesn't require intensive maintenance.\nSharpening\n- The best thing, about this peeler is (unknownst to me at the time of buying) its blade attachment method to the handle. It is not a solid piece, like in just about every other peeler I've seen so far. Crosswise blade comes off real easy, all you have to do is to unscrew 2 small screws holding the blade in place. Now, why is it so important to me? Because like any other cutting instrument, that is used, peeler too needs sharpening. And removable blade makes sharpening very easy, and much more efficient than sharpening a peeler with non-removable blade on Spyderco Sharpmaker .\nI know, this sounds weird to most of the non-knife people, and some of the knife nuts would be surprised at this too, but the point is that, this peeler can be sharpened much better than other designs. Sal Glaser of Spyderco mentioned in his Sharpmaker video, that it is a shame so few people know that their peelers can and should be sharpened. I totally agree with that statement. The difference between the sharp, and dull peeler is very significant. Don't forget, as usual peelers are used to deal with fruit and vegetable skin, which while being soft, isn't always cleanest, and often has dirt on it. That can easily deform or damage the edge, which is inevitable, but one thing you can do is sharpen it later, otherwise it's pretty much useless in a few months. Though, people keep peeling/tearing with them for years, and it takes more and more force to skin that damn potato, but still you push... Go to gym, if you want to work out. Well, I guess eventually, one would throw it away and get a new peeler.\nIf you know, how to sharpen your peeler, you can always get is much sharper, than the new one in the box. Mine was pretty sharp, but not shaving, though that's hardly a requirement for the peeler, the use is quite specific. However, one I got it and discovered that the blade was removable, I removed the blade and sharpened it on the 8000 grit flat ceramic stone. Since the peelers have pretty much chisel blade, it was real easy, although, hard to hold that tiny blade. Back side, which is completely flat is real simple to sharpen, no skills required, just make circular or linear motions on the stone. I got mine mirror polished. Next was the edge side, some efforts, and it was pretty close to mirror polish too. The difference in terms of cutting performance was dramatic, to say at least. The thing, just glides through any skin it's being used on.\nAn update to the above. I'd like to add that last time I've sharpened the blade using 1000 and 2000 grit automotive shadnaper consequently, on the hard surface, followed by 5\u00b5m and 2\u00b5m microabrasive films, finished with stropping on CrO loaded leather strop. Perhaps the last step was excessive, but I just wanted true mirror polish. The result is noticeably better. This refers to polish ;) Cutting-wise, of course it is better, but hardly one would feel the difference with hand, comparing the tiny blade sharpened on 1000 grit stone vs. 2000 sandpaper. On the other hand the blade sharpness, to be precise, its greater sharpness could be felt with the fingernain and shaving tests. In the end, the point is, microabrasives were easier to sharpen with.\nUsage\n- Well, I've been using Crosswise for 2+ years and all the positive impressions. Considering that this is a tool with very narrow specialization I don't have too much to say, it's been a trustworthy worker all this time, never failed me even in the most critical situations ;), like peeling a dozen potatoes. Maintenance-wise, I have to sharpen it once in 2-3 months, at the rate I use it. Not that much, as you can see.\nRelated reading:\n"}, {"score": 265.31454, "uuid": "c739f197-420a-58f2-8366-fa1f27a31a23", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0711wb-31-29425", "target_hostname": "zknives.com", "target_uri": "http://zknives.com/knives/kitchen/ktknv/shun/shunpk103.shtml", "page_rank": 1.2839161e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "Shun Classic DM0716 103mm(4in) Paring Japanese Kitchen Knife Review", "snippet": "Personally, <em>I</em> wouldn&#x27;t <em>buy</em> it, only because VG-10 <em>steel</em> is of no interest to me, <em>I</em> got one VG-10 <em>steel</em> paring knife already, Tojiro flash, which is a little harder than the Shun parer, plus a few other small <em>knives</em>, like Watanabe Ko-Deba knife and Watanabe kamagata paring knife from Shirogami <em>I</em> <em>steel</em>", "explanation": null, "document": "Shun Classic DM0716 103mm(4\") Paring\nJapanese Kitchen Knife Review\nHome > Knives > Kitchen Knives > Kitchen Knife Reviews > Shun\nBy the year of 2011, quite a few Shun knives have passed through my hands, index of the Shun Kitchen Knives reviews is constantly growing. Although, none of them were mine, all of them were loaners from different people. So was the DM0716 paring knife. Almost a year ago I've had its little brother - Shun DM0700 paring knife . This time, friend of mine picked up DM0716, and eventually I got a chance to borrow the knife, to sharpen and play with it. Unlike most of other Shun knives, this one ended up in my hands in a very good shape, just medium dull, but no severe edge damage case like others specimens, there was nothing interesting on the edge to photograph under the microscope and put up in the Damaged Edges macro photography gallery . Obviously, that was a good news, less sharpening work and all that.\nGeneral\n- Shun classic DM0716 paring knife is the second smallest paring knife in Shun's classic series. As you might already know, classic series knives are sort of westernized Japanese kitchen knives, like most of the Shuns. Classic series are damascus clad Warikomi Awase knives. Cladding is stainless damascus steel, and the core is VG-10 steel . Add pakkawood, D shape handle to the package and you get the Shun classic series knife. The DM0716 paring knife is a medium side blade, relatively light for its size. Fit and finish are what you'd expect from Shun. In other words, build quality is very good. Parts are precisely ground and machined, fit together perfectly, no gaps anywhere. Blade finish is very good and the edge out of the box is one of the best on production knives I have ever seen. I'm just stating the facts as they are, even though I am no big fan of Shun's designs. I didn't like their designs, most of them to be precise, and that's my personal take, which you may or may not share. Still, my taste has nothing to do with the knife quality, or blade steel properties, so you have ot decide that part for yourself. I mean whether you like the design or not. For the record, as far as the blade design goes, I did like DM0716 paring knife.\nBlade\n- The blade geometry of the Shun DM0716 paring knife is quite typical utilitarian shape, drop point blade, can't call it neither Japanese nor western. Rather universal, quite widespread shape. The blade measures 103.00mm(4.06\") in length, at its widest it's 22.40mm and thickness at the blade heel was 1.83mm measured using digital calipers. As I said in many other reviews, Shun knives tend to be on the thinner side, and this paring knife is no exception. The blade is mare using traditional Japanese cladding construction, as described above. Jigane or soft cladding is SUS 401 stainless steel, 32 layers, and hard inner core, hagane is made out of Takefu VG-10 steel at 60-61HRC. The steel itself is nothing new, very solid performer, and very widely used in Japanese and western high end knives. This is not another wonder/super steel, but does the job. I wouldn't place it on top of the list, but for most of the people, who are not into exotic, latest super duper alloy experiments like me, VG-10 is a good one. The edge on all Shuns is ground to 16\u00b0 per side. And on all the Shun knives I have seen the edge was nicely polished. Well, at least whatever was left of the original edge, on some of the borrowed knives. As for the blade usability, compared to other paring knives, I find it to be more useful as a paring knife than its smaller version DM0700 paring knife . I haven't compared them directly, as I had them at different times, but based on the use of each one, plus the fact that when I had the DM0700 parer, I also had 4\" long Tojiro flash paring knife , which is sort of similar with Shun DM0716. Based on all that experience, I couldn't really find any paring/peeling job when the small one felt much better than the 4\" knife. In other situations, 3\" blade was definitely lacking. Other than that, there isn't much t say about the blade. Whatever fits better your cutting job and style :)\nHandle\n- The handle on the Shun DM0716 paring knife is the standard pakkawood D-shape handle found on all classic and some other series knives. The bolster, nicely made connects the blade to the handle and at the end, there's a stainless steel buttcap, which on occasion comes handy in crushing garlic, or even small nuts. Although, I myself crush garlic with using the blade of the gyuto or chukabocho , whichever I am using at the moment. Anyway, back to the paring knife, the handles on some of the Shun knives are the biggest reason I dislike them. On Shun classic santoku and Shun Elite Santoku it is way too thick and disproportional, I felt the same way about Shun elite honesuki and Shun DM0702 classic utility knife . Well, perhaps I could go on, but anyway, you get my drift. However, I am happy to report that the handle on DM0716 parer is mucho better and proportionally designed compared to the other knives listed above. I'm no big fan of the D type handles, but given the fact that there is no other choice for Shun classic line, it'll have to do. May be you'll like them more than I do, or you are not as picky about the handles as I am. Well, I do use that type of handles on the knives, it's not like it'll give you cramps :) It's just a matter of convenience for me, and as usual I replace D handles with octagonals. As for the positives, pakkawood is a really good choice for the kitchen knife handle. While it's still wood and isn't impervious to elements, still it's a dense wood, has a nice feel to it, and as far as wood goes, it is quite resilient.\nUsage\n- As with most of the paring knives, I don't get much of the use out of them. I try to test them as much as I can, but by design those are quite limited use, and I don't see the benefits of peeling potatoes or apples for 2-3 hours in a row. So, like with other parers, I just tried a few different fruits, a potato, and I have to say, I really hate peeling potatoes with a paring knife, peelers are much faster. Yes, I do realize that doesn't give me much credit as a \"knife operator\", but I still do it for testing purposes, as a truly dedicated knife tester ;) Anyhow, apples and a single potato were peeled very successfully, I didn't cut myself either. Strangely enough, in last 6 years most of the time I cut myself with kitchen knives, it is on small ones. I guess wielding supersharp 10\"-12\" inspires a lot more respect ;) As for the DM0716 parer, I managed fine, no cuts.\nOne other task that I usually perform, and I don't like doing it as well - peeling avocados. However, for the testing purposes, it is a good validation of the grip security. Once you peel a few avocados, no matter how you try, the knife, gets covered in the really slippery paste, and eventually the handle and my hands are real slippery too. May be you can do it real clean, but I can't, still the purpose is to test the handle security with wet and slipper hands. under those extreme conditions the handle was still manageable, with proper care. There aren't any handle materials that will be 100% secure in those conditions, you'd have to glue the handle to your palm, but for what it was, pakkawood did pretty good, even in D shape. Other testing included using the parer as a small utility knife. Well, go and define the difference between \"utility\" and paring jobs. As far as I am concerned, if you do it off the board, it's paring anyway. just miscellaneous small things, cutting the ends of the green onions, Italian parsley bunches and so on. 4\" is a little small for those jobs, still manageable. One other test was cutting the ends of the Brussels sprouts, but even though, theoretically it's a paring job, except, those things are rather harsh, and for me it's easier to do that on the board, using a larger knife than doing the same in the air with a small paring knife. Again, that's just me. Few other, minor cutting chores, like cutting red radish leaves and cleaning broccoli stems. Radish was ok, broccoli stems were not. Well, both are easily explained by the blade size, no real surprises there. That's pretty much it for the usage and testing the DM0716 parer. No other ideas what to do with the paring knives :) Obviously, cardboard and cables were out of question.\nConclusions\n- Well, simply put, I don't really like Shun knives because of their designs. No complaints about their build quality, or their performance. So, you should draw your conclusions based on that. For what it's worth, I did like DM0716 paring knives better then its smaller cousin, both by design and for its performance. Personally, I wouldn't buy it, only because VG-10 steel is of no interest to me, I got one VG-10 steel paring knife already, Tojiro flash, which is a little harder than the Shun parer, plus a few other small knives, like Watanabe Ko-Deba knife and Watanabe kamagata paring knife from Shirogami I steel, which performs considerably better compared to VG-10, but it is not stainless and requires more care than VG-10. So, the bottom-line is that if you are interested in exotic, latest super duper steels like me, then you might wanna skip this knife. On the other hand, if you just want a good, working kitchen knife and you are ok with the design and the price, then Shun parer might be the one. Easy to maintain, good performer, very well made knife. Just keep mind, this is a Japanese knife, not a western one, so be a little more careful with it.\nSpecifications:\n"}, {"score": 265.09952, "uuid": "842b7ac9-7b61-51f7-b431-8734b9e29694", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0712wb-91-23888", "target_hostname": "zknives.com", "target_uri": "http://zknives.com/knives/kitchen/ktknv/misc/calsk207.shtml", "page_rank": 1.286614e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Calphalon KNSR0102C Slicer 207.00mm(8in) Kitchen Knife Review Page 1", "snippet": "Then, one day friend of mine asked to sharpen a few kitchen <em>knives</em> for him, and as usual <em>I</em> view that as an opportunity to a) practice my sharpening skills; b) evaluate and play with the <em>knives</em> <em>I</em> wouldn&#x27;t <em>buy</em> myself and review them. So, that&#x27;s how the very first Calphalon knife ended up in my hands.", "explanation": null, "document": "Home > Knives > Kitchen Knives > Kitchen Knife Reviews > Miscellaneous\nUp until 2009 I haven't really heard of Calphalon knives. I've seen their cookware on websites and that was pretty much it. Then, one day friend of mine asked to sharpen a few kitchen knives for him, and as usual I view that as an opportunity to a) practice my sharpening skills; b) evaluate and play with the knives I wouldn't buy myself and review them. So, that's how the very first Calphalon knife ended up in my hands. On the side not I can mention Calphalon 115mm paring knife that I got as a present and will be subject to Calphalon Experiment. Anyway, the first one was the 207mm(8\") slicer and I've had it for about two weeks, sharpened, used, sharpened again and finally returned to its rightful owner.\nGeneral\n- Like many, or should I say, most of the loaner knives arrived to me, this slicer was really beat up. There was not much of the edge left on it, and as far as the sharpness went, in my estimation the back of the knife was slightly duller than the place where the edge used to be. Well, that's no biggie, the steel is soft, and unless it's too soft, it's real easy and fast to regrind a new bevel and put it back into shape. However, this poor blade had a bigger problem, the tip was bent. And the bend wasn't in a single place, at least two bends, creating a little wavy shape on the tip. By the way, this one was a good illustration of the differences between Japanese and Western knives. Simply put, should one try to bend the tip of the knife like that on Japanese knife, it'd break. Arguably, broken the tip is better than the bent one but, not everyone agrees. At any rate, I couldn't really sharpen the knife with a bent tip, so I had to fix that somehow. I didn't have blacksmith equipment, since I am just a programmer after all, so I did the best I could with the hammer and a metal plate. I can't commend myself for an excellent job, but the knife was more or less sharpenable.\nAs far as general characteristics of the Calphalon slicer go, it's a medium size slicer from Calphalon's Contemporary series. 207mm(8\") blade may not seem so medium to a lot of people, but for a slicer it is either small or at best medium length. Fit and finish are pretty good for 45$ knife, well to be precise for 45$ you get that slicer and a carving fork. Judging from another Calphalon knife, that parer I mentioned above, Calphalon is your typical western low budget kitchen knife. The initial edge is around 40\u00b0 total. Full tang blade, with polyresin handle and a bolster for whatever reason. Being a slicer, it's just 3mm thick. I'd consider that as a thick one for the slicer, especially 207mm(8\") long. For comparison, Watanabe Pro Sujihiki or Watanabe Kintaro Ame Sujihiki are respectively 2.5mm and 3mm thick, both being 300mm(12\") long. Therefore, it's also quite heavy, 224g(7.57oz). On the other hand, compared to 4-5mm thick western chefs knives of the same length, this slicer can be characterized as slim and slander.\nBlade\n- As mentioned above, the blade on Calphalon slicer is 207.00mm(8\") long. Blade geometry is simple, and very symmetrical drop point. Being a slicer, this knife is designed for rather specific tasks, and as such if doesn't need wide blade, so, not surprisingly the width of the blade at its widest point (the heel) is only 30mm. I've discussed its 3mm thickness in the paragraph above, so we can skip that part here.\nThe steel used in this knife isn't exactly specified. As Calphalon states it is - \u00abHigh-carbon German steel with Molybdenum and Vanadium\u00bb. So, doing a little scientific guessing, and knowing that German steels start with the letter X and they use Mo and V to indicate the presence of Molybdenum and Vanadium respectively in the alloy I run the following query - X*Mo*V* on the Knife Steel Chart . Query returned 7 different alloys, and from what I can tell it's either X45CrMoV15 or X50CrMoV15 . Either one is very similar to 440A steel , which isn't anything to be excited about. Still, for the price, it's not that bad, and most certainly beats the hell out of Cutco, which is the same 440A steel, except sold for few times the price. Hardness isn't specified, but judging from the knife sharpening experience and other kitchen knives from that material, and a knife size it's pretty accurate to say that the hardness for the knife of this size, from 440A or similar steel would be around 54-56HRC. Actually for larger knives it's very much likely to be on 54HRC side, or even 52-54HRC range. Smaller knives get heat treated to higher Rockwell Hardness , because they're less likely to receive the abuse larger knives would. So, in the end, summary is 440A class steel, around 54HRC.\nHandle\n- As Calphalon proudly tells us, the slicer knife sports full tang handle with a buttcap, which is wrapped in a fiberglass polyresin, complete with bolster. So, in other words it has all three features the hypothetical good kitchen knife must have according to knife marketing. In reality, neither one makes a good kitchen knife, nor any of that is required to make a truly good kitchen knife, and you can read more about that in the How To Choose Kitchen Knife article, particularly, in the Don't Fall For the Marketing Hype section. Anyway, whatever that handle is, it is a pretty good handle. I did quite a bit of slicing and dicing with this knife while I had it and I felt it was doing ok. It's a little bulky compared to what I am used to, but nothing unmanageable. One more good thing about the handle is that it doesn't have all sorts of weird curves and protrusions in the name of ergonomics. Relatively simple handle and quite solid. I've used buttcap few times as a garlic crusher, and it did pretty good with that. Since the handle is polyresin, the grip security is high.

Make sure you do not run the sponge\u2014<em>or</em> your hand\u2014directly along the blade at any time.", "explanation": null, "document": "General Questions\nWhat's the correct way to pronounce Shun?\nSay, \u201cShoon\u201d (rhymes with moon). Shun is the Japanese concept of eating fresh, local, and in-season\u2014when food is at the peak of perfection. At Kai, we work hard to live up to that tradition everyday, making fine kitchen cutlery that is always at the peak of its perfection, too.\nWhat is the Shun Honing Steel made of?\nHoning steel is used to realign the micro edge of the knife. With Shun knives, the VG-10 cutting core is so hard that it stays sharp longer than other knives. Depending on how often you use your Shuns, you may wish to hone your knives only once a week or so. The Shun Honing Steel has a micro-ridged stainless-steel rod that is used to gently realign the knife\u2019s edge. It features a premium moisture-resistant PakkaWood\u00ae handle with a built-in 16\u00b0 honing guide to help you hone to the correct angle easily.\nAre the Shun Classic\u2019s D-shaped handles only for right-handed users?\nNo. The D-shape of the Shun Classic handles was designed to tuck into the palm of a right-handed user and provide more control by leaving less space between handle and hand. That said, many left-handers find that the handle works just as well for them. The best way to know whether a knife is right for you is to actually hold the knife in your hands before making your purchase.\nAre the Pure Komachi 2 knives ceramic?\nNo, they\u2019re not. Our Pure Komachi 2 blades are made of high-carbon stainless steel with a food-safe, FDA-approved resin coating. This non-stick coating (similar to Teflon\u00ae) provides the eye-catching color, resists corrosion, makes cleaning simple, and helps the knife glide through food with ease.\nCan I buy direct from you?\nYes, you may purchase Shun knives directly from us at Kai USA. However, we always charge the MRSP (Manufacturer\u2019s Recommended Selling Price), which will normally be higher than what many of our dealers charge for the same products. We do this because we want to support the dealers who carry our quality products by not undercutting their prices. While we would be happy to sell you our products directly\u2014just give us a call\u2014you will usually find a much better price from one of our terrific dealers. And be assured that the Shun product you purchase through our authorized dealers will be fully backed by our famous Lifetime Warranty.\nUse and Care\nHow can I help maintain the life of my knife?\nIf you use your Shun knife correctly, it can be an heirloom possession for you. Using your knife correctly isn\u2019t just about how to maintain the edge and how to sharpen the blade; it\u2019s about how you use the knife on a daily basis.\nPlease do not push straight down on your blades, Not only will this result in arm fatigue for you, it can also be hard on your blades. When you cut, it\u2019s important to use a \u201clocomotive\u201d motion. Move the blade in either a forward or backward direction. By pushing the blade forward when you chop, rather than pushing straight down, the blade does the work instead of having to use your muscle to cut. The same applies pulling back on the knife. This slicing motion will cut down on muscle pain and keep your blade in excellent condition.\nIs there anything Shun knives shouldn\u2019t be used on?\nPlease do not use Shun knives on bones or joints. These knives are designed for precision slicing rather than chopping through bones.\nHow should I store my knives?\nStore your knives in a block, a knife case, a drawer wood holder, a sheath, a magnetic bar, or back in its original box. If your knives are just thrown in a drawer, they can get dulled or chipped, as well as being a potential hazard when you reach into the drawer.\nWhat are appropriate cutting surfaces?\nOne key to keeping a Shun (or any other knife) sharp is to use an appropriate cutting surface. These include wood, bamboo, and polypropylene, all of which are softer materials and will \u201cgive\u201d under the blade. If the knife can leave a cut line in the board, your cutting board is sufficiently soft. Please do not cut on tile, ceramic plates, marble, granite, or acrylic. All of these surfaces will dull your blade very quickly.\nWhat is the proper way to hone a Shun blade?\nTo maintain the life of your blade and for optimal performance, it\u2019s important to keep your knife honed. But remember that there\u2019s a big difference between honing and sharpening.\nHoning maintains your blade. It simply realigns the micro edge of your blade to give you the best performance possible\u2014until your knife is ready for re-sharpening. Sharpening actually removes metal from the blade, putting a fresh edge on the knife. If you hone regularly, you\u2019ll cut down on the need for sharpening and extend the life of your knife.\nYou can easily hone your knives with the Shun Honing Steel. Our Honing Steel has a built-in honing guide set to the correct Shun 16\u00b0 angle. Line your knife up with the guide, then make a few light strokes on each side of the blade. That\u2019s all it takes to maintain the edge. (Please do not use a diamond steel for regular honing. Diamond steels are for sharpening and will remove metal from your knife before it is necessary.)\nWhat's the best way to sharpen my knives?\nAs of April 1st, 2011, Shun Cutlery is offering the highest quality knife sharpening and restoration services through our partnership with Perfect Edge Sharpening. Prices for sharpening and restoration services have been negotiated at a substantially reduced cost for Shun knife owners. Get complete information here\nA second sharpening option is to purchase a whetstone or electric sharpener . Shun offers several whetstones as well as a three-piece Sharpening System that includes hone, whetstone, and a bamboo stand angled to 16\u00b0 that makes sharpening easy.\nFor an electric sharpening option we recommend the Shun electric sharpener which matches the 16\u00b0 angle of our cutlery.\nBut please remember that sharpening is not something that should be done on a weekly basis. Sharpening actually removes some of the metal from the blade, so sharpening too frequently may reduce the life of your knife.\nCan I wash my knives in the dishwasher?\nWe recommend that you do not wash your knives in the dishwasher. Here\u2019s why: The dishwasher can be hard on all your dishes, but it can be especially hard on knives because they tend to get knocked around during the cycle. Conversely, sharp knives can put \u201cdings\u201d in your dishwasher, too. In addition, when you wash different grades of metal together, brown spotting may occur on the higher quality metals (such as Shun blades). These spots can be difficult, if not impossible, to remove. Finally, many dishwashing detergents contain corrosive agents. Not only can this cause unnecessary wear on your dishes, it can also cause pitting or corrosion on your Shun knives.\nFor all these reasons, we recommend that you protect your investment by handwashing your knives with a gentle dish soap that contains no bleach or citrus extracts.\nWhat should I keep in mind when handwashing my knives?\nThe best and easiest method is simply to wash the knife using a damp sponge and mild soap right after you use it. Make sure you do not run the sponge\u2014or your hand\u2014directly along the blade at any time. Thoroughly towel-dry the knife and let it air dry for a few minutes before returning to its proper storage.\nPlease do not leave your knife sitting in a sink full of water. Not only can it be dangerous if you reach into the sink without seeing the knife; it can also be hard on any knife blade and handle if left soaking in water for an extended period of time.\nWarranty Information\nWhere do I ship my knife for warranty service?\nPlease see the Warranty Shipping Form Instructions and Form to send back any KAI-USA, LTD knives for warranty service: WARRANTY SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS AND FORM\nCan I have my old knife back if you choose to replace it?\nWe're sorry, but we cannot replace a knife and return the old one.\nI shipped my knife to you for repair. Have you received it yet?\nWe encourage you to ship via UPS or Fed-Ex as these companies automatically provide a tracking number. The tracking number allows you to easily verify your knife's arrival at our facility. If you prefer mailing the knife to us via the post office, we suggest insuring the package and using the Delivery Confirmation service. Again, this will provide a tracking number for verification of the arrival of the knife. Please note that Shun will not notify you of the arrival of your knife at our facility; having a tracking number from your carrier will enable you to check with your carrier to ensure your package\u2019s arrival.\nHow will I know if my knife is covered under warranty?\nPlease provide your phone number and the best time to call you in your letter of information. If there is any problem with your coverage, we will call you to discuss your knife. Otherwise, we will repair your knife within our usual turnaround time.\nCan I send my knife back to you for routine sharpening?\nAs of April 1st, 2011, Shun Cutlery is offering the highest quality knife sharpening and restoration services through our partnership with Perfect Edge Sharpening.

I knew Fallkniven long before K2 was introduced. I have been using and carrying their A1 Swedish Survival Knife(review) in the trunk of my car for a while by then. Overall I am really positive about that company. Without excessive hype, they produce reliable and dependable knives. Not all too fancy, but real world cutting tools. Surely, they are influenced by market demands, but still. In my opinion they're the good guys :) Back their warranty, provide objective data regarding their knives and testing them and so on.\nOnce I was out to buy kitchen knives one of the choices I've had to make was to stick to Global knives only, or to try other things as well. I've already had some experience with Henckel, Wusthoff and Globals , and made my decision in favor of Globals. So, naturally, I'd have to buy Santoku from Global. After all, it[Santoku knife] is of Asian origin.\nNevertheless, I choose to buy Santoku from Fallkniven. Few reasons for that. One, it doesn't really matter who makes a knife even if it is not their native style. Two, and most important, K2 uses the VG-10 steel that is better then CROMOVA 18 used by Global in their blades. The major deciding factor was the steel hardness. Globals are 56-58 HRC, and Fallkniven specs their blades at 59 HRC exactly. I'll discuss this subject a little bit later, in Steel section. One more reason was that it's thinner than Global Santoku.\nUpdate - Later, however I did get different santoku by Global, the G-48 Hollow Edge only because of the granton edge and it's benefits.\nBlade\n- 7\" long, typical santoku style blade. Rounded tip, wide, straight blade, slight curve towards the tip. Worth noting, K2 came in a nice wooden box. Out of the box sharpness was excellent. Definitely on par with Globals. Convex edge, mirror polished, spooky sharp(that means slicing through the free hanging paper and shaving hair effortlessly). Santokus are wide blades as usual. So is the K2. It measures 47mm in width, at its widest part. At its thickest part blade measures 2.5 mm. Globals Santokus are well over 3 mm. Obviously those are heavier as well.\nFor a lot of people heavier Santoku is preferable, because heavy weight does make chopping easier. However, I was more interested in harder and thinner blade. Given the advantages offered by thinner blade I figured that after all I wouldn't be chopping wood or bones with this knife, and soft stuff such as vegetables don't need excessive force in general, or if needed I could use other knife. Eventually all that worked out. For harsher vegetables I'd use either Global GF-33 Forged Chef's Knife or one of my field knives. But for usual vegetable cutting K2 works like a charm. Thin, super sharp blade just glides through.\nOne more detail, K2 has black Teflon coating over the blade. Primary reason for applying that coating is to protect the blade from the destructive forces of the elements(water, air, stains, etc). Second, which is probably a side effect, Teflon improves friction properties, to be precise reduces friction because it is so slippery. So, whatever you cut, will stick less to the blade. The drawback with Teflon coating is that it is very \"fragile\". While it's pretty much intact on my K2, which is only because I take good care of it, Teflon gets real messed up on the field knives. Basically after first or second use it gets all scratched up. According to Benchmade scratches don't really affect corrosion protective properties of Teflon coating, as it goes into metal pores, but sure thing that affects the looks ;) If that matters to you - beware.\nAs Fallkniven states they've run marathon tests on the coating in a dishwasher with no visible defects upon the surface.. However I would sincerely warn you against sticking your K2 in the dishwasher. one thing is a single knife for testing purposes in there, another is a dishwasher full of pots, pans and god knows what else with a knife in it. After all, the test doesn't tell you how did the edge survive, or if it survive at all ;) And no other quality knife should end up in the dishwasher. I wrote about that in Kitchen Knife Maintenance Tips . Aside of the reasons listed in that section, remember, the blade is covered, but the edge is not. You can clearly see bare metal on the picture. In the end Teflon does have few pluses, especially if you have to cut something real acidic, but don't count on it too much. You still have to wash your blade.\nGiven the harder edge, Teflon coating and because it is a Santoku knife that 99% of the time I am using for push cutting I constantly maintain mirror polished, very sharp edge on this knife. Final finish is done with 3000 grit polishing tape and then stropping on the CrO loaded leather strop. Splits hair before even touching it ;)\nSteel\n- The steel is the VG-10 stainless, as I've mentioned that above. I've already commented regarding VG-10 steel and its use by Global in GF-33 Forged Chef's knife review . Initially, I got the wrong info about Global using VG-10 in their blades. Later turned out that, CROMOVA 18 used by Yoshikin in their Global knives is a different steel, even though VG-10 contains all three elements, Chromium, Molibdenuim and Vanadium. I've made some comments comparing those two steels in GF-33 Forged Chef's knife review . In short I think VG-10 is better then CROMOVA 18. At least for my usees. I do take care of my knives, don't leave them dirty or wet, maintain edge, wash by hand, etc. And more importantly I cut stuff with theright knives. So, I don't have much use of Global knives increased toughness (due to lower hardness) or stain resistance(thanks to 18% Chromium). On the other hand, I clearly enjoyed better edge holding on K2. More on kitchen cutlery steels in Kitchen Knife Steel FAQ .\nOne thing I'd have to note here is the ease/difficulty of sharpening. Lower hardness in general means easier sharpening. However, during more than 3 years of use both K2 and G-48 Hollow Edge(review) I didn't really notice that VG-10 at 59HRC was much harder to sharpen than Global's CROMOVA 18 at 56-58HRC. VG-10 does get sharper though. It has different feel when sharpening, hard to explain how it is different, but sharpens differently and gives keener edge. Thanks to higher rockwell hardness K2 can maintain thinner edge noticebly longer than Global G-48 santoku .\nEven if it was the same steel for those 2 santokus, the difference in hardness is 1 point at best, or 3 points at worst. All things equal, 1 HRC difference in hardness can amount up to 20% increase or decrease in wear resistance, depends from what side you look at it. In short, theoretically if you had 2 identical knives, one at 58 HRC, another at 59 HRC and set to cut the same materials, applying the same force second one would cut 20% more material before dulling as the 1st. Of course in reality things are far more complicated. Heat treatment is more important than 1 HRC difference, but granted that both makers do know their stuff, I wasn't afraid of bad heat treating. Identical forces are also hard to apply, but more or less, a person would cut same materials with roughly the same force, but not identical. Obviously, santoku from Global is a different knife than santoku from Fallkniven, blade geometry is similar but not identical, thickness, etc.\nThe relationship between hardness and toughness is not simple either. But in general the harder the blade is, closer to its limits, easier it will chip or fracture instead of denting and rolling. 59HRC that Fallkniven used in K2 is pretty much close to upper limit for VG-10, but definitely not the limit. I'd have much lower chances chipping 56 HRC blade, but the loss of wear resistance would've been very significant. So, all those things considered, and also the fact that I was counting on myself that I could take care of my knives and use them properly I went for K2 White Whale. If you use hard blade for cutting right materials(not necessarily soft, can be abrasive, but not harder than the metal itself), it'll last you a lot longer and will require less maintenance(doesn't mean no maintenance at all).\nHandle\n- Officially K2 uses Black Thermorun. I have no idea what exactly that is. Some sort of polymer I guess. the tang is fully covered, no exposed metal. Handle itself is pretty comfy in standard grip. Not all that good in reversed grip, but on the other hand, you won't be using santoku in reversed grip anyways, or you're asking for trouble. As of the grip security, no problem with it. I've used it with oily hands, with wet hands, sliced and push cut with it, no slippage.\nAs far as the comfort goes, K2 handle is a good one. I've cut with it for quite long periods of time, around 25-30 minutes, sometimes more. No sore spots on my palms, never felt uncomfortable. Overall, it may not be the best handle there is, but definitely a very good one.\nUsage\n- Well, I've pretty much covered this topic above. To summarize shortly I'd have to say that I use K2 only for vegetable cutting. Because I keep it always very sharp the cutting process with K2 is a joy. Few times for experimenting I've tried to use it to cut other stuff, for the few things performed well, for others not so good. Surprisingly it was real good with cheese, which is one of the worst things to cut out of all foods, and real hard on the blade. Not good for peeling anything, due to its size and blade geometry. Good slicer, but it has a polished edge, so at this point Globals with rougher 600 grit edged perform better in that area than K2 with the edge above 3000 grit.\nSpecifications:\n"}, {"score": 259.333, "uuid": "1633160a-ce49-586c-8b38-3d1d72cb8db2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0710wb-94-06849", "target_hostname": "zknives.com", "target_uri": "http://zknives.com/knives/kitchen/ktknv/wusthof/wustgpsk200.shtml", "page_rank": 1.3593767e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Wusthof Grand Prix 4189 170.00mm(7in) Santoku Kitchen Knife Review", "snippet": "Nothing interesting <em>or</em> different to speak of.

Came to me with bunch of other knives to be sharpened and played with. To be honest, I wasn't all that excited with the prospect, just my curiosity of a knife nut and reviewer. One way or another, Wusthof kitchen knives are one of the most widespread knives in the world, at least western world and making their way into Asia as well. Although, that's not to say they don't have their share of problems, mainly related to the same style and steel for decades. Well, we'll talk about that later. The knife was given to me for sharpening and I had it for about 2 weeks. Can't say I've used it all the time, but I've had a few cutting sessions with it, one of them was mandatory(for reviews) approximately hour and a half long vegetable cutting session. Other cutting sessions were shorter, but in the end it was more than enough to get the feel for this knife and form an opinion. After all, it wasn't a new type and I didn't have to learn how to use it properly.\nGeneral\n- Wusthof Grand Prix 4189 knife is your typical western santoku , even if that's an oxymoron. To be precise, it is a granton edge santoku, which is increasingly popular in western and Asian knives of all types. I've had my fair share of Santoku knives reviewed , and Wusthof's santoku wasn't something extraordinary compared to those. Most closely it resembled another German made(surprise!) santoku knife - Henckels Granton Edge santoku . Overall, it is a medium size knife, about 300g(12oz) heavy, wide blade, polypropylene handle. For the santoku knife it is almost as big as it gets, 170.00mm(6.69\") long blade, the biggest santoku I've ever seen or heard of was 180mm long. Nothing else to speak of, fit and finish are ok, and the same complaint as with the Henckels granton edge santoku, the scalloping is not very evenly spaced from the edge, and in some places too close to the edge. That poses knife life expectancy issue, in simpler words after N number of sharpenings, the edge will be hitting the scalloped sections and the knife will be pretty much useless and not really sharpenable either. Given the X50CrMoV15 steel, which is hardened at 54-56 HRC, it'll need sharpening quite frequently. Japanese knives I've tested and examined always had better and more even alignment of the scalloping, e.g. Tojiro Flash Santoku Knife . Well, the Wusthof costs less than half of that too.\nBlade\n- Wusthof Grand Prix 4189 santoku has 170.00mm(6.69\") blade, which is ~2.8m thick, not very thin compared to other santokus I have seen, but not the thickest either. Henckels was thicker at 3.17mm, Tojiro, Fallkniven, Henckels Miyabi santoku were al thinner. I've already commented on the placement and quality of granton feature of the edge, Other than that, it is a typical santoku blade geometry. Nothing interesting or different to speak of. The steel used in the Wusthof santoku is the good old X50CrMoV15 stainless steel , used in majority of mid/high range western kitchen knives. I've commented on that steel quite a bit in kitchen knife steel FAQ and other reviews. For details - X50CrMoV15 steel composition and alternate names .\nSharpening\n- As far as sharpening goes, X50CrMoV15 is quite easy, I never had any problems with it, although it never has problem dulling rather quick on me either. I've used standard set of sharpeners, except didn't go with 0.25\u00b5m diamond loaded strop, stopped at 0.3\u00b5m and stropped on the plain leather. So, the procedure included: 1200 grit King whetstone , followed 3000 grit synthetic (blue) aoto waterstone and, few strokes per side on the 5000 grit Naniwa Chosera waterstone and 10000 grit Naniwa Chosera Super Finishing waterstone . For the record, I had to keep 40\u00b0 total angle on the edge, since the knife wasn't mine and I wasn't counting on original owner's intention to use it very carefully.\nHandle\n- Simply put plastic handle, more precisely Polypropylene if that makes any difference for you. It is not dishwasher safe that much is clear. As for the ergonomics, it's pretty simple handle, not as complicated or ergonomic as the one on Henckels granton edge santoku. From what I remember about using Henckels santoku, I can't say it was better than Wusthofs, but as far as comparisons go, I do prefer both Miyabi and Tojiro handles over the Wusthof handle. They feel a lot more solid and comfy in hand. Grip security is ok, the surface isn't very smooth to become slippery. Although, when I rubbed some olive oil on my palm to test the grip, it was problematic. Anyway, that was a test, and in general you should avoid working with oily hands on knife.\nUsage\n- As mentioned above, the longest session was my relatively standard veggie cutting test, which includes about 20 different vegetables and lasts anywhere from an hour to hour and a half. Given the variety of the ingredients and the fact that Santoku is more or less general purpose knife, that is a pretty good test of its abilities. I figure, I have to mention again, Santoku is not a dedicated vegetable knife, as many western knife manufacturers and dealers claim, Nakiri and Usuba are dedicated vegetable knives, but Santoku is a general purpose knife, closer to Gyuto or a chef's knife. Anyway, the test started with the broccoli. I've chopped and minced it. The stems became more challenging compared to the gyuto knives I use routinely. Mainly because of the lack of the length, and consequent lack of slicing ability. So, I had to rely on push cutting more. Except X50CrMoV15 and any other steels hardened to 54-56HRC will not have great edge stability and the edge holding suffers form that. Things went better with Brussels sprouts, because they are smaller. Green onions and parsley were also ok to chop and mince, but the celery was a trouble, it's rather harsh, and the knife was struggling if I tried to chop few stems together, so I had to work with them individually and therefore spend more time on the job. Radish and artichoke hearts went easy, with asparagus same story as with celery, had to work on small bunches, as soon as the stack was higher than ~3 inches the knife was too short to slice down and I had to switch to push cutting. Julienne from Basil was easy, the knife has wide enough blade and length was no problem either. Carrots were a trouble, at least when I was cutting batonnet. Just slicing off circles was alright, but batonnet was more problematic, thicker edge than what I am used to, half the length...\nI've used Wusthof Santoku few more times, but mostly on the items that it worked well for in the tests described above. I can't say I really enjoyed using it, partly because santokus are not my favorites to begin with, partly because of the thicker edge and frankly edge holding isn't that great. Nothing specific to this particular Wusthof 4189 santoku though, it's the steel and heat treatment. At the end of the first cutting session which lasted a little over an hour and a half I could tell the edge degraded considerably from the original sharpness. It's on par with Henckels granton edge santoku if you want the closest match.\nConclusions\n- Well, it's not too bad, not too good either. I wouldn't buy it for myself unless I was constrained somehow. Besides, I figure it is not even produced anymore, although Wusthof introduced subsequent model, 4173. There are better choices out there and even if they cost more those are better knives. So, basically consider this a budget, entry level santoku. Sure, there are much cheaper ones as well, but that probably goes into junk category anyway.\nSpecs:\n"}, {"score": 251.04327, "uuid": "47e3d745-1fb9-5a4d-ac70-329056a9a1e6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0711wb-05-20878", "target_hostname": "zknives.com", "target_uri": "http://zknives.com/knives/kitchen/ktknv/wusthof/wustclbk140.shtml", "page_rank": 1.315193e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Wusthof 4306 140.00mm(5.5in) Classic Flexible Boning Kitchen Knife", "snippet": "<em>I</em> didn&#x27;t <em>buy</em> it though.", "explanation": null, "document": "Wusthof 4306 140.00mm(5.5\") Classic Flexible Boning\nKitchen Knife Review\nHome > Knives > Kitchen Knives > Kitchen Knife Reviews > Wusthof\nThat's one rather old knife that ended up with me. I didn't buy it though. The original owner picked up the Global GF-31 boning knife and this one was retired, not completely, used for the random cutting jobs, obviously, as it happens those somewhat retired and many other kitchen knives too, those cutting jobs were not exactly what the knife was designed for. Therefore, it wasn't a surprise that the knife was completely dull. Plus numerous sharpenings, some by me and some by its owner. You can see on the photo, the edge is quite worn out. Granted the knife was anything but useless, I've asked the owner if I could take the knife for testing and experimenting and I got the yes as an answer and a knife with it. I'll talk about the planned experiment later in this review, but for now let's move to the knife itself.\nGeneral\n- As the knife description says, this is a flexible boning knife. Typical western boning knife. Complete with all the goodies knife marketing loves to make noise about, specifically full tang, bolster and triple riveted slabs onto that full tang handle. You're all set aren't you ;) Anyway, I wrote in quite a good detail about usefulness of those features in the How to Choose Kitchen Knives article , you can get that info over there. Other that that, it's a medium size boning knife, with polypropylene handle and weighing about 117g(4oz). I figure originally it was a little heavier, but all the sharpenings would remove a few grams of metal. As for the flexibility, I wouldn't say it's too flexible, but does have some flexibility in the tip area. 1.8mm thickness it pretty good for the thickness. The blade still has sufficient strength around the heel to go through the joints if necessary, but generally boning knives are designed to work around and in between the bones, not chop through them. If you have to cut through the bones, then either use western style meat cleaver, or alternatively, use Japanese Deba type knife . Other than that, fit and finish were ok in the beginning and the knife was still in a pretty good shape when I got it. I was rather surprised to see the handle slabs quite intact, even after multiple washes in a dishwasher. As usual they crack and become loose. Although, please don't take this comment as an encouragement to put your Wusthof or any other knife in a dishwasher. And the experiment I am conducting is a good argument against dishwasher use too, link below.\nBlade\n- The blade has quite standard western boning knife geometry. 140.00mm(5.51\") long, 1.8mm thick and about 20mm wide at its widest. As usual, my main problem is the bolster, but this narrow boning knife is one of those cases when it makes some sense, protecting fingers from slipping down on the edge. Even for experienced people bolstered knives are no joy to sharpen. Inexperienced folks, especially the ones with electric grinders simply ruin them. Anyway, you can work around those bolsters just fine, it's more work. Original blade had about 40\u00b0 inclusive angle, or 20\u00b0 per side. That's also typical for western knives and given the steel used in the Wusthof boning knife - X50CrMoV15 to be precise, plus the designed use, which implies occasional bone contact, can't avoid that completely... So, 40\u00b0 is more or less reasonable edge sharpening for the X50CrMoV15 steel, at 54-56HRC. As usual I'd consider that thick of edge to be a problem, but ok, softer steel, probable bone contact, you need thicker edge.\nHandle\n- As you already know, slabs are plastic, attached to the full tang using three rivets. It's an ok handle. I don't use Wusthof boning knife regularly, so may be I've missed some issues with it, but generally there doesn't appear to be many. It's neither something outstanding, nor something really bad. Just an average handle. Doesn't bother during work, no slippage issues. Not being a butcher I have no serious use for boning knives, so I can't comment on prolonged use. I've used it twice, instead of my own Global GF-31 boning knife, and that was about it. So, my impressions on handle comfort are limited, based on just those two occasions. Haven't heard any complaints from the original owner either, who managed to use it as a multi purpose knife, and I have no idea how that works with boning knife :) As in, it's hard to imagine chopping vegetables with this knife, but bunch of people still do it.\nUsage\n- Two sessions, both for its dedicated use. Once it was lamb rack and another time it was pork ribs. The knife performed ok, although I am used to thinner edged. I was careful not to hit the bones, but one way or another bone contact still happens. Still, the edge held up pretty good, no chipping, minor rolling. Considering the short amount of time for each session, the result doesn't give reason to commend the edge durability. Anyway, by now I can honestly say I am familiar with X50CrMoV15 steel performance capabilities, I've used it from many makers, in all sorts of knives. It's quite old steel, typically gets hardened to 54-56HRC. In longer knives and those designed for harsher use, and that included boning knives makers tend to make softer, so it's a safe bet to assume the knife is closer to 54HRC than its upper range. Sharpening is easy, save for the arch formed by the bolster. Long story short, this is your average western boning knife and it can take some beating. if you are not very demanding about your knife edge holding ability and sharpness, this one will fit the bill, if the price is right.\nI mentioned above, the knife was intended for experimenting, and eventually I'll probably break it or destroy in some other way, depends what kind of data I will be gathering. As of now, which is summer 2010, the knife is a subject to the rust in a dishwasher experiment. Simply put, I keep dishwashing Wusthof boning knife repeatedly, although in part one, which is commencing at this time, I don't use it for food, just wash it in a dishwasher and dry it. Rust appeared quite quickly and keeps developing. I suspect the knife will rust even quicker if I use it for cutting food and then dishwash it, that's a part two of the experiment. The detailed log and photos of the test is in the Stainless Steel Knives In A Dishwasher, Why You Should Avoid it article.\nSpecs:\n"}, {"score": 255.78763, "uuid": "a1d9d0ef-e289-55ee-929c-e12d8d2e2b8f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1315wb-88-13768", "target_hostname": "www.jesseshunting.com", "target_uri": "http://www.jesseshunting.com/forums/showthread.php/211722-Work-Sharp-sharpening-system", "page_rank": 1.1711655e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Work Sharp, sharpening system", "snippet": "[&#x2F;QUOTE]OK..........explain to me why a finer edge would last longer if it wasn&#x27;t for the hardness of the <em>steel</em>.

Sorry, but I disagree with you.\nFrom knife-making-supplies.net website:\n\"If a knife is not sharp enough to cut what you need to cut then it is useless. The edges have to be sharp throughout the life of the knife, but it is not so. If you see the cutting edge of a knife closely with the help of a magnifying glass or a microscope, you could see there are small teeth that make the look of a saw. This is what makes the knife sharp and useful. On using a knife repeatedly it becomes blunt. If you look at a blunt knife with a magnifying glass you could see that the saw like cutting edges are bent and not in alignment. You have to make them straight to be useful again.\nThe effort you take to sharpen a knife depends on the hardness of the blade that is used in the knife. If the hardness is more then it takes more effort to sharpen the cutting edges and the knife would retain the sharpness for longer time. If the hardness of the blade is less then it is easy to sharpen the knife and it will lose the sharp edge sooner. A Rockwell scale is used to measure the hardness of the metal that is used in the blade of the knife.\"\nLast edited by 700x4me; 09-26-2011 at 03:52 PM.\nGun control means hitting what you shoot at!\n334\nThanked 93 Times in 78 Posts\nActually you are both correct, It depends on blade angle and what you are using the cutting tool for.

If polishing does the trick, then why don't they make knives & cutting tools out of Aluminum or Brass or Copper? Because they aren't hard enough. You could polish the edge on them 'til it shined, but it still wouldn't hold an edge. So, hardness is the main factor for cutting tools. Oh & by the way, I've been sharpening tools for the last 50 years or so being a Carpenter, so I do have a little knowledge about sharpening tools & knives. Sorry!

All you need are 3-4 ingredients: Flour, butter, salt, and sugar (optional).\nThe key to getting your pie crust to turn out nice and light and flaky is in keeping everything cold. Your water should be ice cold to start. Your mixing bowl should be chilled. And your butter should be frozen.\nThat\u2019s right, frozen. Frozen butter makes great pie crust.\nThere are two methods to getting the butter just right for your homemade pie crust. I\u2019ll show you both ways here.\nJen\u2019s Flaky Pie Crust\nIngredients\n1/2 C Unsalted Butter (1 stick), frozen\n1/2 C Water, chilled\n1 tsp. Sugar (optional)\nDirections\nIn a chilled mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. Place the bowl back in the refrigerator.\nTake your butter out of the freezer and chop it into tiny little pieces. As I mentioned before, there are two methods of doing this.\n1) The cheese grater method\nUse a dishtowel or potholder to hold the butter as you grate it on your cheese grater\u2019s largest setting. This will help prevent melting from the warmth of your hands.\nAs little piles of butter flakes build up, use a knife to transfer them onto a plate and stick them back in the freezer. Continue this process until the whole stick of butter has been grated.\n2) The chopping method\nAs you can imagine, you don\u2019t need a cheese grater to get small chunks of butter. You can use your regular knife to chop it up into small pieces.\nJust be mindful that you\u2019re chopping frozen butter, which is much harder than room temperature or refrigerated butter (aka, be careful with your knife).\nI like to use my chopping knife from Shenzhen Knives for this step. The ceramic blade doesn\u2019t stick to the butter, which is important since I want to cut through it as quickly as possible without touching it to get it off the knife (that transfers heat, which will make the butter melt.) It\u2019s also very lightweight and easy to cut with.\nOnce your butter is chopped into small cubes, place it back in the freezer for a minute or two.\nGrab your bowl of dry ingredients and your butter. Add the butter to the dry ingredients by \u201ccutting in\u201d \u2013 adding the butter a little at a time and using a knife or spatula to cut it apart as you mix it.\nAfter your butter has been mixed in, slowly add your cold water to the mixture, 1 Tablespoon at a time. Add just enough water to make a dough ball that isn\u2019t too sticky.\nFlour your work surface and quickly knead your pie crust dough until it starts to smooth out. It\u2019s helpful if you chill your hands before working with the dough.\nLightly flour the dough ball and cover it with plastic wrap. Allow it to chill in the refrigerator for at least one hour, up to 12 hours. (I usually skip this step and my pies still turn out great.)\nRoll out your pie crust on a generously floured work surface. This recipe is supposed to make one 9\u201d pie crust, but I find that it makes one nice bottom crust, and just enough for a very loose lattice on top. You can freeze your pie crusts to use later or use immediately for a delicious, flaky treat.\nWant to win a ceramic Shenzhen knife like the one I used to chop my butter in the recipe above?\nJust head on over to my Current Giveaways page to enter.\nMore about Shenzhen Knives :\nShenzhen Ceramic Knives can be used by anyone for most slicing and cutting needs. These ceramic knives are made of an advanced ceramic called\nzirconia, the second hardest material known to man next to diamond.\nThe material\u2019s properties make it particularly resistant to wear and tear, which means that a ceramic blade can hold its edge much longer than a steel blade without the need for re-sharpening as often as steel knives.\nThey are rust-proof and have no metallic smell or taste. They do require a little bit of extra care, and technically, you\u2019re not supposed to use them to slice frozen foods. I was still able to slice through my butter, since butter doesn\u2019t have much water content so it doesn\u2019t freeze completely solid. I do love it for other cooking needs, like slicing vegetables and meat.\n"}, {"score": 253.94295, "uuid": "6232023b-fbc4-548a-af43-698b53f1a53f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0004wb-13-14702", "target_hostname": "housewares.about.com", "target_uri": "http://housewares.about.com/od/knifereviews/fr/ginsuchikara12pcblockset.htm", "page_rank": 1.2242446e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Ginsu Chikara Knife Set - Ginsu Chikara Series 12-Pc Block Cutlery Set", "snippet": "<em>I</em> was very surprised at how comfortable these handles actually are and they&#x27;re not slippery when wet.

The Japanese style handles, rich (darker) grain of the block and its slanted and stepped design, all enhance the look of the set. The whole cutlery set is well-balanced - it includes the common variety of knives as well as steak knives, a Santoku , a steel and utility shears.\nHandles are slightly tapered easy-care resin with a modified oval design that is well scaled to the size and weight of the knife blades and that gives them very good balance and control. There's a smooth transition from handle to bolster to blade, with no sharp edges. I was very surprised at how comfortable these handles actually are and they're not slippery when wet.\nBlades are quality forged steel, extremely sharp with full tang. All knives except one utility knife, have fine straight edges, including the steak knives. The nice keen edged steak knives sliced cleanly and easily through even tough cuts of meat and easily doubled as utility knives. As far as performance, all knives in this set exceeded our expectations. We were able to easily slice a tomato with any of them. The Santoku is tops for chopping and dicing. It and the paring knife quickly became favorites.\nThe steel rod is of reasonable quality with an adequate finger guard. The block actually has a kinder-on-the blades softwood center with a Bamboo veneer and slots that are open through to the bottom which is good - it allows residue or dust to flow through, rather than build up in the slots.\nOverall Impression\nThe Ginsu Chikara cutlery not only looks beautiful but performs much better than expected. It has the makings of a durable, high-quality knife set with blades that will hold their edges well and look nice for a long time. The entire set is a very convenient mix of common practical knives as well as specialty cutlery.\nThe 12-pc Chikara Set is ideal as a quality starter cutlery set because it includes most essential kitchen knives, plus a few extras. It's also a good choice if you want to upgrade your assorted older knives to an affordable large block set. It presents well and would make a lovely affordable gift.\nI like the look, feel and efficiency of these knives. You can't beat the value, quality and variety you get with this set for the price. The free lifetime sharpening is also very nice.\nRelated Resources\n"}, {"score": 253.83214, "uuid": "47450310-da53-5070-9ff1-f4ef379531b7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1716wb-85-02634", "target_hostname": "www.bladeforums.com", "target_uri": "http://www.bladeforums.com/forums/showthread.php/634739-Microbevels/page5", "page_rank": 1.1801531e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Microbevels - Page 5", "snippet": "Using what <em>I</em> call the better angle choice ZDP is a very good <em>steel</em> IMO. <em>I</em> will say that <em>I</em> NEVER got the chipping on any other <em>steel</em> I\u2019ve used like <em>I</em> did with ZDP-189. Of the <em>knives</em> <em>I</em> have now my favorite <em>steel</em> is CPM-S30V and CPM-M4.", "explanation": null, "document": "Originally Posted by nccole\nWhat I write is in red.\nAlright, I decided to play with this micro-beveling some more. I took my Sage 2 which I had always put a 38 degree inclusive and ground away with my diamond stones using the sharpie on the edge extensively. I think the sharpie trick helped me understand this more. I decided to put a 22 degree inclusive back grind on it to maximize my chances at seeing it when I was done and understanding how to accomplish it more. First off, is that combination ok? Yes. That is a pretty low back bevel but using S30V and the Sage2 as an EDC knife it sounds fine to me. Excellent slicer. I wouldn\u2019t use that angle combo with S30V and use it as a camp knife though. OTOH, it may hold up fine. I like and trust S30V a whole lot even though I don\u2019t use knives hard any more very often. Maybe a 38/28 inclusive combo would be safer for a hard use knife when camping/hiking, hunting, etc. Especially if you frequently put a lot of side to side stress on the knife edge. I see a lot of 40/30 combinations and I think I ground at 11 degrees per side for a while, then came back at 19 per side. I also changed up the order in how I did it. Instead of using all four at one angle and then coming back with all four at the other angle I did one diamond/stone at both angles then moved onto the next diamond/stone , and there is where my sharpie mark really helped me. I could see the sharpie line disappear at the edge only with the 19 degree and then more of the sharpie mark towards the spine at 11 degrees. About the 40/30 angle combination. Most people who have been using/sharpening knives for many years hold to this tried and true edge angle combination. The Spyderco Sharpmaker is set with those two angles. Unless a knife has specific uses requiring something else those angles on an edge is fine for an EDC knife. But, the improvement in knife blade steels in the past several years enable the blade to be strong enough to sharpen at lower angles and maintain the strength for less chance of chipping and also maintain good edge retention. So, now we try to get as low as we can for better cutting performance. About the order of stones/angles we choose to do next. I\u2019ve seen people decide to work through stones and angles in different order. I don\u2019t think it matters at all as long as you understand the reasons for choosing a particular order of stone/angle progression to get the result you want. All we are really doing is removing unwanted steel from the razor sharp edge that is inside every knife blade.\nYou probably know this but I\u2019ll mention it anyway. When working on one side of a knife edge, completing maybe 90% of the work that side needs then doing the same to the other side there is the potential of moving the edge off center of the blade. That\u2019s assuming the edge was centered to begin with. Personally, I work with the same stone at the same angle on both sides of the edge, then move to the next stone at the same angle. By working in this sequence I complete (almost) the lowest back bevel angle all the way through getting a mirror finish if I want on that bevel. Then I move back to a coarser stone for the next higher bevel angle I\u2019m putting on the knife. Most of the time it\u2019s one back bevel then the edge bevel. Two (or three) back bevels can create a convex edge shape (sort of). Is that beneficial? Who knows.\nSome people swear convex edges slice better. I\u2019ve wondered if you blindfolded one of these people and had them cut the same material with the same type knife, one with one flat bevel (on each side) and the other a convex edge would they be able to consistently feel which one they were cutting with. Just because we know one is better based on scientific data obtained in laboratory testing doesn\u2019t mean it will make a big difference in every day life. When I\u2019m finished with a knife edge I want both sides to look like siamese twins joined at the edge. Maybe not identical twins but twins just the same. I took my time and went super light on the ceramic and this is definitely the sharpest I have gotten this knife yet.\nJackknifeh:\nI think I may do this to my Caly 3, I like how it turned out. Is this about what your zdp looks like? My picture is not great, but you can make out the edge bevel as more of a shadow. Yeah, I put some scratches where I did not mean to.\nMy ZDP blades looked a lot like the edge in your picture right at the edge. From the picture the back bevel looks more like a convex shape than a flat bevel which is cool. I\u2019ve never used a Gatco sharpener but it sounds like you can get a good range of consistent angles with it. I free-hand sharpen and have gotten good enough to sharpen at angles with accuracy at about .1 degree margin of error on every stroke. That\u2019s a lie. Sorry. I use an Edge Pro because other than touching up an edge I stink at re-profiling a knife edge free hand. For touch-ups I use fine and UF ceramic stones and strops. I liked a back bevel of 26 deg inclusive and an edge bevel of 38 deg inclusive for ZDP-189 blades. The edge bevel was wide enough to be seen easily, like yours is. With my first ZDP knife I thought I was going to be able to sharpen at very low angles and maintain great edge retention because the steel was so hard (64-66 Rc). My first task was replacing an electric outlet in my house. Using the knife to cut the insulation around the copper wires resulted in a couple of very tiny chips in the very edge. You could barely see the chips but could easily feel them when cutting phone book paper or running your finger nail along the edge. The micro chips as I called them didn\u2019t hurt cutting performance at all but I figured when using ZDP on tougher work the low angle edges may chip with larger, visible dings in the edge. These chips even occurred when cutting and peeling potatoes when the ZDP was at an edge angle lower than 30 deg inclusive. So, I always sharpened my ZDP edges at 38 degrees inclusive no matter what back bevel angle I used on a knife. I used 38 because when I touch up on a fine or UF stone I could hit the edge around 40 degrees and quickly get the hair shaving edge back. Using what I call the better angle choice ZDP is a very good steel IMO. I will say that I NEVER got the chipping on any other steel I\u2019ve used like I did with ZDP-189. Of the knives I have now my favorite steel is CPM-S30V and CPM-M4. I can peel potatoes and cut them into french fries with either steel and not have any chips in the edge at all. Edge retention is great with these steels also. All of my knives have an edge bevel between 30 and 38 degrees inclusive. My back bevels can go as low as 24 inclusive but normally around 28. I don't really want the 20 degree inclusive angles. I don't cut anything where angles that low would be of any benifit I don't think.\nI hope this was informative and not too boring. I get long winded. I\u2019ve gotten interested in sharpening, trying to get the ultimate razor sharp edge in the past five or six years. Mirror finish on the bevels also is something I\u2019m getting pretty good at. You need the correct, good quality sharpening tools to make things easier (or even possible). I can stand outside and see the reflection of the tree branches above my head in the bevel of some of my knives. Once I had a saber grind VG-10 Spyderco Endura that I put an edge bevel of 40 degrees. Then I lowered the back bevel to 36, then 32, 28 and stopped on 24 degrees (I think, might have stopped after 28) inclusive. It really looked nice. I had 4 or 5 flat bevels along the edge that were even and very visible as you rotated the blade slowly under the light. But the cutting performance didn\u2019t improve enough to do this all the time. I don\u2019t know if it improved cutting performance that much anyway for EDC cutting. It was cool just for fun though. You\u2019re thinking I have too much time on my hands aren\u2019t you.\nSorry to be so long winded.\nJack\n"}, {"score": 251.03421, "uuid": "4ed1729a-5cfa-5470-9439-a2ad4a0caccc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1315wb-52-28048", "target_hostname": "www.knife-depot.com", "target_uri": "http://www.knife-depot.com/knife-185492.html", "page_rank": 1.1895466e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Boker Leo Damascus Letter Opener", "snippet": "Today, Boeker <em>knives</em> range from 320-layer Damascus <em>steel</em> to very modern <em>ceramics</em>, with handles ranging from high-quality mother-of-pearl to Thuya root wood and state-of-the-art synthetics...

It is durable and very sharp. Before this I used a special opener that was made out of plastic. It was a piece of crap - kept tearing the envelope. My Boker Leo Damascus Letter Opener cuts through envelopes like a knife through butter. It was well worth the money I paid plus it is durable (should last forever) and it looks good, too. It is very stylish.\nA giant chestnut tree, shading the small Boeker tool factory in Remscheid in the 17th century, is the oldest traceable symbol connected with the Boeker name. Apparently, Boeker tools were very successful, since they were among the leading products in Germany and neighboring countries 100 years later.\nDue to the increasing demand in a restless political era, Hermann and Robert Boeker decided in 1829 to begin with the production of sabers. As early as September 1830, the accounting records indicate a weekly production of 2,000 items, made by 64 smiths, 47 grinders and a large number of unskilled laborers. In view of the constantly increasing variety of tools and cutting instruments and the good opportunities for worldwide sales, the family realized that the individual steps in the manufacturing process had to be spread out for optimal realization of its interests. As a result, Hermann Boeker emigrated and founded H. Boeker & Co. in New York. Young Robert developed his enterprise in Canada, founding a branch in Mexico later in 1865. This branch is still a market leader in its country under the name of Casa Boeker.\nHeinrich crossed the nearby Wupper river and went to Solingen, where the German industry of cutting tools was growing by leaps and bounds at that time. In 1869, he founded Heinr. Boeker & Co. with Hermann Heuser, a well-known specialist in the field of cutting tools. The Boeker family in Remscheid and their overseas cousins had a lot of interest in and a great demand for shaving blades, scissors and pocket knives from Heinrich's new enterprise. They had to identify their products for the overseas markets in a simple way, since many customers and consumers had problems with the German name Boeker ? not considering the fact that illiteracy was widely spread. In Heinrich's opinion, the chestnut tree near the Remscheid facility represented an ideal, easy-to-remember symbol. This brand symbol was owned by the Remscheid company, together with a second logo, the arrow. One of the few valuable documents that survived the total destruction of WWII is an ad by Boeker, Remscheid, from the year 1874, showing both logos.\nThe relationship between the two Boeker companies had always been extremely friendly. Therefore, Heinrich was allowed to take the tree symbol across the river with him ? without any big fight or cost. Since then, not a single Boeker article has left the Solingen factory without being identified by the tree symbol. After more than 100 years of existence the old chestnut tree was the victim of lightening. In 1925 a talented artist carved a copy of the majestic tree on a piece of the trunk. This original piece of art decorates the boss' office in the Boeker plant.\nAs early as 1900, the majority of articles produced by Boeker were distributed in the US market. H. Boker & Co. in New York concentrated primarily on cutting tools from Solingen. Soon pocket knives became more important than scissors, shaving blades and eating utensils. The demand increased even more rapidly than Solingen was able to supply, so that the Americans in New York began their own production of pocket knives. A little later, pliers were included as well. Since the tree symbol had become well known by then and the various branches of the international Boeker family enjoyed an excellent relationship among each other, it was not difficult to receive permission from the Solingen relatives to use the tree symbol also for the American products. Since that time, two different lines of Boeker knives have been on the American market with the same brand symbol, sometimes even with the same article numbers, but one line was made in the USA and the other in Solingen. Only the declaration of marketability clarified that one line was from Boker USA and the other from H. Boker Improved Cutlery Solingen. The relationship was interrupted during WWII. The Solingen factory burned down completely. None of the equipment, tools, catalog materials or samples was spared. Those few originals from the past we have today survived the war in private homes and were made available to the company. The firm lost one of its most valuable assets: the registration of the tree symbol for the American market was confiscated pursuant to American law. John Boker Jr. acquired it in New York, in order to secure it for the distribution of the American and German products. Soon after the war, the destroyed factory was rebuilt. Those loyal skilled workers who had survived the war, returned and helped with the reconstruction of the building as well as the production, gradually regaining the previous high standard of quality.\nThe American cousins renewed their business contact with Solingen and started to place orders. Within a few years Boker, New York, had again become the principal customer. Models like the 7588 and 7474 and the most expensive item, the sports knife \"Flagship Model 182\" could not cross the ocean fast enough to reach B\u00f6ker friends all over the country.\nIn the early 60s, Boker USA was sold and eventually acquired by the well-known scissors manufacturer Wiss & Sons. Wiss retained the manufacture of Boeker knives and sold them together with Solingen products. Of course, this meant that the Boeker scissors ceased to be competitors of the Wiss line in the American market. In the early 70s, Wiss sold to Cooper Industries, a multinational company. This new change in America proved to be advantageous for Boker.\nA very close business, as well as personal relationship developed with this industrial giant. Due to its strength on the market, Cooper was able to restore the original magnitude of the Boeker name. Thanks to the very lively business activities with Cooper for eight years, the Solingen facility could streamline its production and develop new, modern products. Without exaggeration, Boker manufactures the largest assortment of high-quality knives for sportsmen and collectors with an unsurpassed variety of materials for blades and handles. Today, Boeker knives range from 320-layer Damascus steel to very modern ceramics, with handles ranging from high-quality mother-of-pearl to Thuya root wood and state-of-the-art synthetics...\nIn 1983 Cooper discontinued its own knife production. Models still in demand are being manufactured in Solingen today. As a result of friendly negotiations, Cooper restored the American trademark rights three years later, providing Solingen with the opportunity to become self-reliant in the huge American market. Thus, in 1986, Boker USA, Inc. was created in Denver, Colorado. Chuck Hoffman, the man who was involved with the company then, was active as CEO until 2007, working with a young, energetic team. The current CEO is Dan Weidner.\nThe great importance of Boeker in the South American markets (Argentina and Chile) and in Mexico is due to the efficient men of the Boeker family, who were active for us in these countries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Today's trademark includes the terms TREEBRAND and ARBOLITO. Since the Argentinian market in particular is subject to extreme economic and political fluctuations, the good name ARBOLITO was in danger of being forgotten. In 1983, Boeker Arbolito S. A. was founded jointly with the Salzmann family primarily to manufacture household and work knives in Argentina. Thanks to the constant modernization and expansion of product lines the company in Buenos Aires is able to compete worldwide with selected products today.\n<a href=\"/custom/boker_warranty.doc\">Boker Warranty Information</a>\n<a href=\"/custom/boker_ceramic_info.doc\">Boker Ceramic Knife Information</a>\nKnife Depot Special Offers\nThrough April 30, take $5 off any order over $100.

Select style to narrow the results.\nWondering how to decorate your table top? It may seem daunting, but it doesn\u2019t need to be. In general, table tops consist of dinnerware, flatware, glassware and accessories. If you break down each step you\u2019ll find a visually delightful table setting.\nOn a mission to create the perfect table? Consider the following advice:\nFirst, tips on purchasing dinnerware:\nWhat types of dinnerware are available? Oftentimes, people have two dish sets: one for formal situations, and one for everyday use. Read below to learn more about each.\nFormal: More commonly known as fine china, formal dinnerware is usually sold to serve either four or eight people. Place settings generally include five basic pieces: a dinner plate, salad plate, soup bowl, cup and saucer. Some sets also come with bread and dessert plates, a teapot and a serving platter. These are delicate items, so be sure to skip the dishwasher and wash and dry by hand.\nCasual: Casual sets usually come with dinner plates, salad plates, glasses and bowls, however, some will include saucers, a second small bowl or serveware. These are easier to maintain and will hold up in the dishwasher, and are usually sold as a package to serve four.\nWhat styles of dinnerware should you consider? With an endless amount of options, choosing the right dishes can easily feel overwhelming. However, it really comes down to preference and how you plan to use it. Choose a casual, colorful dish set to add a vibrance to a neutral kitchen. Perhaps you want to consider hand-painted fine china to add an touch of elegance to your formal dining room. Not sure if you want to commit to a color or pattern? Ivory or white sets are timeless and classic, and will match anything for years to come. Or, create an eclectic vibe on your tabletop by mixing and matching different complementary dinnerware sets.\nWhat materials might you choose from? Materials will likely differ between formal and casual dinnerware sets. For the more casual look, you might find styles in melamine, which is made of plastic resin. Or, you might come across pottery or stoneware dinnerware, which are two types of clay fired at different temperatures. Pottery and stoneware dishes are shiny and waterproof due to eventual glazing. However, if you\u2019re intending to purchase a more formal set, you\u2019ll likely find yourself looking into porcelain or bone china options. Porcelain is a bitter or sometimes translucent variety of stoneware, while bone china is porcelain made with bone ash and refined clay.\nHow many place settings should you buy? On average, it\u2019s advisable that your dinnerware collection be comprised of 8 to 12 place settings. Even if you have a small family, you\u2019ll want to be prepared for entertaining larger groups.\nSecond, tips on purchasing flatware:\nWhat types of flatware are available? Like dinnerware, people often have two sets: one for formal situations, and one for everyday. More formal flatware, or silverware is usually made from sterling silver, and is usually heavier. The spoons, forks and knives are often more traditionally styled and should be hand-washed. More formal flatware sets often include a dinner and salad fork, dinner, butter, fish and steak knives, soup, dessert, tablespoon and teaspoon, and serving pieces. Casual flatware is available in a wide range of styles, can be heavy or light and can be safely cleaned in the dishwasher. These sets usually include a dinner fork, salad fork, dinner knife, teaspoon and tablespoon.\nWhat styles of flatware should you consider? Seek out a flatware set that complements your dinnerware set. If you have a more traditional, bone china flatware set, pair it with sterling silver for a look of grandeur. Or, if your dishware is casual, white and classic, consider something with a contemporary handle design for an unexpected flair.\nWhat materials might you choose from? Usually, the choice is between sterling silver or stainless steel flatware. Silver is generally used for more occasional, formal situations, while stainless steel is suitable for everyday. In terms of stainless steel flatware, seek out sets that are rust and stain resistant for easier maintenance and durability. Regardless of whether you choose silver or stainless steel, you still want to ensure you\u2019re purchasing a quality set that will last you for some time.\nHow many sets should you buy? On average, it\u2019s advisable that your flatware collection be comprised of eight to 12 place settings. Even if you have a small family, you\u2019ll want to be prepared for entertaining larger groups.\nThird, tips on purchasing glassware:\nWhat types of glasses are available? In the world of glassware, it\u2019s quite possible there is a glass for everything. When deciding what types work for you, consider what kind of drinks you like to make and what you may be serving to your family or to your guests. See below for an overview of the available types.\nStemware: These are your basic wine glasses, champagne flutes, snifters, martini glasses, and margarita glasses. Are you more of a wine drinker? Maybe wine glasses are all you need. Do you plan to entertain in your backyard over the summer? Maybe margarita glasses would be a fun addition to your collection.\nBeer glasses: These include pilsner, pint and beer stein glasses. Often, certain glasses go with certain beers, so think about your favorites to drink and serve to help you decide on what to buy.\nTumblers: Highball, Collins and old-fashioned glasses make up the tumblers family. The main difference in these is height.\nEveryday glassware: Everyday glassware includes things like drinking glasses and coffee mugs. Also, you might want to consider purchasing shot glasses to measure liquor while making mixed drinks.\nWhat styles of glassware should you consider? Glassware styles are truly far and wide, ranging from casual to formal. You could purchase colorful, inexpensive martini glasses for a casual dinner party, or serve your guests with crystal champagne flutes for a more formal occasion. Consider mixing and matching your everyday glasses and coffee mugs for a fun, unexpected look.\nWhat materials might you choose from? This depends on the type of glass, but glassware materials generally range from glass, crystal, plastic, melamine or ceramic. Cups made from glass range from everyday to formal in style, while plastic glasses are great choices for the kids. Ceramic is advised for anything that will hold hot liquid, such as coffee.\nHow many glasses should you buy? On average, it\u2019s advisable that your glassware collection be comprised of eight to 12 place settings. Even if you have a small family, you\u2019ll want to be prepared for entertaining larger groups.\nAnd lastly, how can you accessorize your table top?

What is this?", "explanation": null, "document": "We've taken the heat out of shopping for cookware.\nOur product guide will help you find the perfect ingredients.\nGet cooking! Easier said than done, isn't it? Great cookware is one of the best investments you can make, but with so many choices, how do you know what you're supposed to use? Breathe easy. We're making it a little less intimidating. First, think about the kind of cooking you want to do, how many people you'll be cooking for and your level of expertise. Build your collection by choosing the basics, then by adding all the specialty pans your little heart desires.\nWhatcha' got cookin'? Nothing if you don't have the proper material. The number one thing to look for in a great cookware set is the construction. No single metal is ideal for all types of cooking applications. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. An essential quality you should look for in all cookware is weight. A heavy pot or pan will sit securely on the burner. Just make sure it's light enough for you to lift easily.\nWith that said, here are the main ingredients for selecting the type of material your cookware is constructed of.\nTypes of Cookware Materials:\nAluminum\nAluminum is probably the most popular material in cookware with lots of upsides. It is an excellent heat conductor that spreads heat evenly throughout the pan. And the thicker the aluminum, the more evenly the heat spreads. Aluminum can be anodized to harden the surface. Hard-anodized cookware is harder than steel and is extremely durable. Plus, aluminum is dishwasher safe. It's also relatively inexpensive compared to other materials. The downside? Untreated aluminum is prone to staining and reacting with foods. For this reason, we recommend aluminum with a nonstick interior because it's much less likely to discolor or react with foods.\nCarbon Steel\nCarbon Steel can produce both the most expensive cookware or the least expensive. Maintained like cast iron, but lighter in weight, it's good for cooking that requires quick heat changes because it maintains temperature well. The most common pans made out of this material are Woks or Stir-Fry pans. It's rare in a lot of other cookware because stainless steel provides the same function, without the high maintenance.\nCast Iron\nCast Iron is very thick and heavy duty. Although it is slow to heat up, cast iron has the ability to retain and evenly disburse heat. This means that it's an excellent choice for browning, drying, braising, stewing, slow cooking and baking foods. Cast iron comes in either bare iron or with enamel coating. Bare iron needs to be \"seasoned\" before it is used. To season it, thoroughly wash and dry the pan, lightly rub shortening on the surface and bake it in the oven at 300 degrees for about 60-75 minutes. The seasoning process will give your pots and pans a nonstick surface that lasts forever! Once your pots and pans are seasoned, you should avoid soaking and washing them with soap. The best way to clean is to just wipe it with a cloth (you actually want to leave the grease on them). Enamel-coated cast iron provides all the benefits of cast iron, but it requires less maintenance and cleanup is easier.\nHowever, some foods do not cook well in cast iron. Acidic foods will react with it\nand will strip off the coating. If that should happen, don't panic, just season your\npan again!\nCeramic\nCeramic cookware is a great insulator, so it does not react quickly to heat. It can usually be found in the form of a casserole dish or other shapes that are great for cooking slowly at constant temperatures. It's lighter than cast iron, but it is also more fragile. It can be characterized under different categories, including: porcelain, stoneware and earthenware.\nPorcelain, the strongest of the three, is fired to become very hard and durable. This type can usually be used on the stove, in ovens and microwaves.\nEarthenware, on the other hand, is less strong and often prone to chipping and scratching. Decorative and very pleasing, this type of material is often used as serveware.\nClad\nClad cookware is developed by using two types of cookware materials together to get all the benefits of both materials. Most of the time, stainless steel is clad with aluminum. This gives you the thickness and excellent heat conductivity of aluminum and the easy-to-maintain, corrosion resistance of stainless steel. Quality clad cookware will last through a lifetime of cooking, so if you're looking for true investment pieces, then this might be your best material. The downside of this type of cookware is that it is generally heavy and expensive.\nCopper\nCopper is the very best conductor of heat. Because of this, it is especially great when cooking on top of the range where the food must be cooked at precisely controlled temperatures. Copper can, however, react with foods and be toxic in large amounts. Therefore, copper pots and pans are usually lined with another material like stainless steel. Traditionally, they were lined with tin, but the tin tended to wear out too quickly. The biggest disadvantage of using copper cookware is the maintenance. Copper can discolor from being air dried and washed in a dishwasher. Polishing it will remove the discoloration. Also, copper dents and scratches easily.\nStainless Steel\nStainless Steel is a very good all-around general-purpose cookware. It's lightweight, durable and easy to care for. Plus, it won't corrode or tarnish, and its nonporous surface is resistant to wear. It is, however, a poor conductor of heat and does not distribute heat evenly. Because of this, many stainless steel pots and pans are made with a copper or aluminum disc in the bottom to help absorb more heat evenly. Because of its smooth surface, stainless steel is easy to clean and maintain. Plus, it's dishwasher safe. If discoloration occurs, a stainless steel cleanser can be used to restore the natural luster. Stainless steel is great on the range top or in the oven. If your application calls for changes in the temperature while cooking, it's the perfect choice! Metal utensils can be used on stainless steel or aluminum surfaces.\nNonstick\nNonstick cookware has a coating on the interior surface that makes it difficult for foods to stick to it. This makes it very easy to cook healthy, nonfat foods. Plus, since foods don't stick to the surface, cleanup is a breeze! Nonstick cookware can be found in combination with many metals that produce cookware. There is, however, one disadvantage to nonstick cookware. The nonstick coating can be easily scratched. Stainless steel or other metal utensils can scratch the surface. Nylon utensils are recommended when cooking with this type of surface.\n"}, {"score": 242.63046, "uuid": "a9239c9a-817b-5bb4-a770-4c6993007664", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1101wb-22-08390", "target_hostname": "www.chefsworld.net", "target_uri": "http://www.chefsworld.net/news_details.asp?NewsID=fVxQ", "page_rank": 1.1723595e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "The Cutting edge - How to pick a chef Knife - ChefsWorld -Chefs Jobs,", "snippet": "A high carbon stainless <em>steel</em> blade is an alloy combining the best of both worlds: It doesn&#x27;t discolor <em>or</em> corrode, sharpens easily and holds an edge. <em>Ceramic</em> <em>knives</em> came on the scene about 10 years ago, and are prized for their sharpness and precision.", "explanation": null, "document": "Coming Soon\nThe Cutting edge - How to pick a chef Knife\nAfter reading that local chefs Rita Calvert and Ken Upton described a good knife as their most treasured kitchen tool, several of my friends and neighbors asked me if knives are truly important. My answer is a definitive yes.\nAlmost every recipe in a cook's repertoire involves cutting of some type, making a knife the most frequently used tool in the kitchen. To be effective, a cook should have quality, reliable tools, especially when it comes to knives, which are inherently risky if uncomfortable to use, dull or inefficient. Professional knives, which by their manufacture and design are sharp and well balanced, do just one thing very well: They cut.\nOf course, having a knife and using it well are two different things. Being able to handle a knife effectively can be the determining factor in the taste, texture and presentation of a dish. Here is a very brief primer on how knives are made, how to buy a knife and how to use it.\nWhat makes a good knife?\nKerry Smith, owner of A Cook's Revenge on Main Street in downtown Annapolis, provided an insightful refresher course on knives. He reminded me that you don't have to spend a lot of money to get a good knife. The veritable scimitars you may see wielded by chefs on television are jokes to many restaurant and food service chefs. These brilliant cooks who actually use knives every day, all day, frequently rely on off-brand knives (found at restaurant supply stores) that are as comfortable, sharp and reliable as some of the fancier varieties you may see for hundreds of dollars at the mall.\nOf course, after toiling in the dregs of a hot kitchen all day, professional chefs do like to retreat to the luxurious solitude of their home kitchens, where the tools are their own, individually chosen with love. According to Mr. Smith, this affection for enduring quality will cost in the range of $50 to $150, with more expensive models being sheer luxury.\nMuch of the cost of a knife is determined by its manufacture, including composition and design. The design of a knife directly affects its balance, sharpness and longevity. Stamped blades are cut from a thin ribbon of steel using a template, much like a cookie cutter. The blades are tempered, sharpened and finished, usually by machine. The blade of a stamped knife is fitted into its handle, so the knife is not considered one fluid and integral piece. While usually thinner and lighter, the design of stamped knives requires a firmer grip and more pressure when chopping, mincing and dicing. They are usually priced lower than forged cutlery.\nForged knives offer the top of the line in quality. During production, a steel bar is heated to a very high temperature, set into a die and hammered to form a blade. It is then crafted by hand through tempering, sharpening and finishing, sometimes in up to 50 separate steps. Forged knives will always include a bolster and a tang. Knives that are \"fully forged\" are formed from one piece of metal and produce the strongest and sharpest blade.\nMr. Smith noted that while the design of the knife is important, you should also consider the composition of the blade specifically.\nCarbon steel blades are an alloy of carbon and iron. They sharpen easily, but are prone to corrosion and discoloration.\nStainless steel blades won't rust or corrode, but are more difficult to sharpen. Once properly sharpened, however, stainless does hold a good edge.\nA high carbon stainless steel blade is an alloy combining the best of both worlds: It doesn't discolor or corrode, sharpens easily and holds an edge.\nCeramic knives came on the scene about 10 years ago, and are prized for their sharpness and precision. They are 10 times sharper than steel with no surface tension. They aren't cheap, however, and given their brittle nature, they may break and chip more easily than a carbon stainless blade.\nMr. Smith highlighted the five most important factors to consider when purchasing a professional knife:\nThe knife should be comfortable to hold: It should feel substantial but not too heavy, which can lead to fatigue and strain. It should be well balanced in your hand with ease of cutting motion.\nIt should have a full tang (see diagram at left), (as opposed to a 3/4 or \"rattail\" tang), which provides optimal support, strength and balance.\nThe bolster should be integrated into the blade, not as a separate collar, so that it can provide adequate protection to fingers and knuckles.\nThe handle should be made of moisture-proof polypropylene or stainless steel with a smooth finish. Gaps or seams in the handle or between the parts of the knife will cause deterioration and can also harbor harmful bacteria.\nA good knife will be durable: It should last for years with proper maintenance and regular sharpening.\nWhen you prepare to purchase a good knife, hold it in each hand to consider its weight, balance and comfort. Ask the salesperson to try the knife; it should cut through office paper without pressure or resistance.\nMr. Smith doesn't advocate purchasing knife block sets sold by mass retailers. According to him, these sets contain many knives you don't need and may never use due to lack of comfort or knowledge. Instead, focus on purchasing just two good knives: a French or chef's knife and a paring knife. A serrated slicer makes cutting bread or tomatoes easier, but isn't necessary if you have a good, sharp chef's knife. Ditto with a boning knife.\nKnife safety\nKnives should come with one of those universal disclaimers stating the obvious: Improper use can lead to serious injury. Holding the knife correctly is vital for safe and efficient cutting.\nWhen researching this article I turned to Chef John Toohey of Whole Foods Market for advice on knife skills. Mr. Toohey graduated from the Culinary Institute of America, where a stray cut could lead to an apoplectic professor, much less a failed class. He reminded me that when taking the rigorous Master Chef exam, many applicants have been rejected based on their knife skills alone.\nMr. Toohey teaches two ways to hold a knife, whether by the tang or the blade. Test which method feels comfortable to you using a back-and-forth or up-and-down motion. When cutting, always hold the knife with your dominant hand, using the fingertips of your opposite hand to hold the object you are cutting. Curl your fingers inward toward your palm with your thumb well away from the blade, using your knuckles as a guide for the knife. When held properly, the blade will rest lightly against your knuckles, ensuring a consistent cut and intact, whole fingertips.\nMaking the cut\nOnce you know how to hold your knife, it's time to practice cutting skills. Chef Rita Calvert has mentioned to me many times that practicing her knife skills is a mentally and spiritually therapeutic exercise. She relishes an opportunity to appreciate the rhythm of her work and the beauty of the food, and so should you.\nGood knife skills are important, largely because the size, shape and consistency of cut foods determine cooking time, and thereby the taste, texture and even presentation of a dish. Imagine how chopped shallots taste, look and feel differently than minced. Or how chunks of vegetables floating in a silky soup would perhaps be better as a small dice. There are numerous basic knife cuts, too many to mention here, so Mr. Toohey identified the most important:\nA mince is a very fine, even cut appropriate for herbs, garlic and shallots. Use it when you want the object to be physically minimized in the dish.\nJulienne and battonet are long, rectangular cuts of even length and width. Julienne produces thin strips appropriate for garnish (crudites) or frying (french fries). Battonet can be used similarly, but produces a thicker cut. To julienne vegetables of an uneven shape, such as carrots, trim the vegetable so that the sides are straight, which will make future cuts much easier. Slice the vegetable lengthwise, then stack the slices, align the edges, and make parallel cuts of the same thickness through the stack.\nA dice is a cube-shaped cut used in making everything from croutons to soup and salads. It is perhaps the most familiar, although most frequently poorly executed shape. Dice an onion too big and you may have salsa rather than dip; slice it too small and you may have charred bits rather than savory silkiness.\nThere are four basic sizes of dice. To master the cut, properly julienne the fruit or vegetable, then cut crosswise at evenly spaced intervals to make a cube. Brunoise is a very small dice, precisely 1/8 inch on each side. Small dice is a bit larger at 1/4 inch, while medium dice is 1/3 inch and large dice is 3/4 inch.\nA chiffonade cut produces long, thin ribbons of leafy vegetables or herbs and is frequently used for garnish. To chiffonade basil leaves, stack the leaves on top of each other, then make fine parallel cuts across the leaves to produce fine shreds.\nPractice makes perfect\nNow that you have a good knife, know how to hold it and have memorized shapes and sizes of cuts, it's time to get to work. These recipes should help you practice your knife skills, use some of those vegetables you purchased over the weekend at the market, and encourage some culinary meditation.\nRATATOUILLE AND GOAT CHEESE SALAD WITH PESTO VINAIGRETTE\nFrom Epicurious.com\n3/4 cup packed fresh basil leaves\n1/2 tablespoon minced garlic\n1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan\n1 tablespoon pine nuts, toasted golden\n1 1/2 tablespoons white-wine vinegar\n1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil\nFor ratatouille:\n1 long narrow Japanese eggplant\n1 small zucchini\n1 small red bell pepper\n1 small green bell pepper\n3 tablespoons olive oil\n1 small red onion, chopped fine\n1 medium vine-ripened tomato, seeded and pureed (about 1/2 cup)\n2 teaspoons minced garlic\n3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley leaves\n2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil leaves\n1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves\n12 ounces soft mild goat cheese at room temperature\n8 ounces mesclun (mixed baby greens)\nTo make vinaigrette: In a blender or small food processor, blend all vinaigrette ingredients with salt and pepper to taste until smooth.

And it doesn't take months, or even weeks: A knife can go dull in just a few minutes, especially if you're cutting through tough materials, such as bone.\nWhat's the best way to maintain that snappy edge that makes light work of chopping and slicing? First, it's important to note that there's a difference between tuning up a relatively sharp knife and sharpening a dull knife. A so-called sharpening steel, the metal rod sold with most knife sets, doesn't sharpen at all: It's a tune-up device. As you cut with a sharp knife, the thin cutting edge of the blade can actually turn to the side, making your blade seem duller than it is. Running the knife blade over the steel, as most professional chefs do each time they're about to use a knife, simply realigns that edge and makes it straight again. It can't reshape a truly dull blade that's rounded and worn down. That's when you need a sharpener that can cut away metal and restore the standard 20-degree angle of each side of the edge.\nTo reshape the edge of a dull knife, you have a few choices, depending on the amount of effort, skill, and money you want to invest. You can send it out (inconvenient, even if you can find someone to do it). You can use a whetstone (very difficult for anyone but a professional). But the best option for most home cooks is to buy a tool (either electric or manual) that does most of the work for you.\nMost sharpeners, both electric and manual, start their work with a coarse material and progress through stages of finer material to polish the edge. In general, the hardest material is diamond, followed by tungsten carbide, followed by high-alumina ceramic, followed by steel. Hardness isn't everything, though; the material is only as good as the angle of the knife being swiped against it, so the design of the sharpener is important. Some models guarantee that even an inexperienced user will get the right angle; other models make this more a matter of chance.\nMost of the electric sharpeners we found to be up to the job. They did differ on how quick and easy they were to use. In addition to taking less time and trouble to reach a fine edge, newer models feature spring-loaded blade guides that allow no ambiguous wiggle room as they hold the blade against the sharpening wheels at the proper angle, replacing the trickier magnetic guides on older models. The sharpening wheels on newer models also reach closer to the edge of the machine, ensuring that the sharpening extends all the way to the end of a knife.\nShould you bother buying a manual knife sharpener? The better options will help you maintain new knives and are fine with moderately dull blades. But be prepared to pay a professional to handle your more challenging sharpening needs. In the long run, an electric sharpener is a good investment, if you can make the initial cash outlay. If not, pick up a cheap manual sharpener. The best ones are far superior to steeling rods and will keep many of your knives in decent shape.\nTry AmericasTestKitchen.com\nStart Your 14-Day Free Trial Membership\nGet all 12 years of America\u2019s Test Kitchen:\nFull access to 12 seasons of America\u2019s Test Kitchen recipes.\nComplete 12 year video library \u2014 watch entire episodes or individual clips.\nUp-to-date results for all our Taste Tests & Equipment Reviews.\nEasy to print shopping lists, and more.\nHow we use your e-mail address\nDear Friend,\nIt is hard to believe, but 2012 marks the twelfth anniversary of the America\u2019s Test Kitchen television show.

a common \"knife sharpening stone\" won't do, they are usually far too coarse for this job even if they have a side described as \"fine\".\u00a0 There are several ways to obtain a suitable hone.\u00a0 You can get what's called an \"Arkansas stone\", which is sold in fine knife stores; an Arkansas stone is typically used after a regular stone when sharpening knives because it is very fine-grained and applies a very smooth finish to the cutting edge.\u00a0 An Arkansas stone may be difficult to find, though.\u00a0 If you get one, be sure to get some honing oil to use with it.\u00a0 They sometimes are sold together -- along with a coarse stone -- as a \"knife sharpening kit\".\nAnother route would be to purchase a diamond hone for sharpening knives, but you need to make sure to get a very fine one, 600 grit or thereabouts.\u00a0 Harbor Freight Tools sells a couple of models, including some with three or four grits on the same block.\u00a0 The problem with these things is that they typically have rows of holes all over the surface, which may help sharpening knives somehow but it just causes grief honing gouges.\u00a0 Still, often such diamond hones will have a flat area uninterrupted by holes at each end that's large enough for our purposes.\nContrary to the Arkansas stone, a diamond hone works best dry.\u00a0 A diamond hone also seems to get finer with use, apparently as the high points of the grit get broken off the surface, but it keeps on working.\u00a0 It actually works a little better for this task after it's been worn a little bit.\nYet another way to go would be to use a piece of 600-grit sandpaper taped down onto a flat surface such as a piece of glass.\u00a0 This may sound like the quick and easy route, but it's more difficult to obtain a good edge with sandpaper.\u00a0 If at all possible, the above two methods are preferred.\u00a0 If you choose to use sandpaper, be sure to pull your gouge across the sandpaper rather than push it; pushing can cause the sandpaper to curl up a bit just ahead of the gouge and dull it rather than sharpen it.\nThere are other ideas that might work.\u00a0 A ceramic or stone coaster might work -- that's right, the disc your drink is sitting on while you read this.\u00a0 It must have a flat surface and a fine grain -- ceramic will usually be smooth enough, but many of the stone coasters are too coarse.\u00a0 The surface obviously can't be coated with paint or glazing.\u00a0 If it's painted or engraved on top, you might try flipping it over and peeling that cork layer off the bottom.\u00a0 Using the bottom is also less likely to incur the wrath of your significant other for ruining one of your coasters.\nBesides the hone, you will also need a ceramic knife.\u00a0 It's possible you've never heard of such a thing; they are a fairly recent technology.\u00a0 Basically it's a knife with a blade made of bright white ceramic rather than steel.\u00a0 The reason:\u00a0 ceramic is much harder than steel, so it will hold an edge better -- and for this task, it means it can be used to hone the inside edge of your hardened steel gouge without the knife itself getting polished instead.\u00a0 The good news is that you can buy a ceramic knife at Harbor Freight Tools.\u00a0 They carry three sizes, a 3\" paring knife, a 5\" utility knife, and a 6\" chef's knife.\u00a0 Any size will work here, but once you have this knife you'll want to put it to use in the kitchen, too -- trust me, these are great knives -- so choose the size that would best fit your kitchen needs.\nYou can also buy a ceramic knife at Walmart.\u00a0 Side note:\u00a0 A ceramic knife will cut most anything, and that includes your fine china!\u00a0 Don't use one as a steak knife -- you'll notice that Harbor Freight Tools doesn't offer a steak knife version -- because diners would be cutting your plates as well as the steak.\u00a0 Use a ceramic knife only on a cutting board or similar surface.\nIf you can't find a ceramic knife the only possible substitute known is a Flexcut Slipstrop, which is a honing kit designed specifically for sharpening carving tools.\nI haven't used one, but I understand they are made of wood and use a fine rouge or polishing compound to provide a cutting action.\u00a0 What's important here is that it have a razor-sharp edge; a sharp edge is essential to make your gouge better rather than worse when sharpening.\u00a0 If the wood in the Slipstrop has a sharp edge that'll be good, but if that edge gets dull with use you're either going to have to figure out how to sharpen it or keep buying new Slipstrops every now and then.\u00a0 It's probably cheaper and easier to buy the ceramic knife, since it'll last essentially forever -- and if it does get dull, you can sharpen it with a diamond hone (but not an Arkansas stone; rub your ceramic knife against an Arkansas stone and the stone loses!).\nThere is one other thing you might want to make use of, and that's a grinder of some sort or another.\u00a0 Something powered by electricity.\u00a0 Basically, anything with a flat grinding surface will do, and that includes a drill or Dremel with a flat disk chucked up in it.\u00a0 Honestly, if you're only working on one or two gouges, a power tool is scarcely worth the trouble; it's more important when Webfoot ships you a box of 120 gouges she wants modified!\u00a0 For just a couple of gouges, you can accomplish the same tasks by hand using the various honing tools described above.\u00a0 Using one of the coarser grits on a diamond knife hone works especially well.\u00a0 So, in the instructions that follow, when it says to use your grinder, remember that you can just do the job by hand if you prefer.\u00a0 If you are using a powered grinder, please note that the tip of a gouge is pretty tiny and will overheat quickly if you're not careful.\u00a0 Always have a cup of water handy and dunk it regularly during grinding to keep it cool.\nINSPECTING YOUR GOUGE: If we could presume that your gouge was properly shaped at the factory, we could proceed directly to sharpening.\u00a0 Experience has shown, though, that a large percentage of both Speedball and Staedtler gouges were not properly shaped at the factory.\u00a0 So, using strong magnification -- a loupe or other 10X magnifier if you have it -- and good light, look at the tip of your gouge.\u00a0 There are two common faults to look for:\u00a0 First, are the two sides of the cutting edge the same length?\u00a0 If one protrudes forward farther than the other, we'll have to fix that before we proceed.\nThe other common problem is the profile of the cutting face when viewed from the side; the actual cutting edge should form a straight line.\u00a0 If it seems to round the corner at the bottom of the V, we'll need to fix that, too.\nNote that the bottom of the tip, below the actual cutting edge, is typically rounded.\u00a0 This is not a problem.\u00a0 It's when the cutting edge itself curls back toward the handle that's the problem.\u00a0 In other words, the grinding done to round the area below the cutting edge went too far.\nWhat follows is a procedure for cleaning up that tip so it's straight before sharpening.\u00a0 If you happen to be one of the lucky souls with a gouge that was shaped right to begin with, you can skip down to \"SHARPENING\" below.\nCREATING A PROPER TIP: The following process will fix whatever's wrong with your gouge short of having been run through a garbage disposal.\u00a0 Step 1:\u00a0 Holding the handle (not the tip!) perpendicular to the grinding surface, grind the front of the nib a little bit.\nLooks like you're ruining your gouge, doesn't it?\u00a0 Aaaaack!\nAfter you've ground just a bit, take a look at it end-on with a light positioned to reflect off the tip.\u00a0 The grinding you have done will have created a shiny area -- or perhaps two shiny areas.\u00a0 If you had the rounded bottom problem, you'll probably get shiny spots at the top of the V, but they don't connect at the bottom.\u00a0 If you had one side longer than the other, you probably got a shiny spot on that side only.\u00a0 You need to continue this grinding until the shiny area forms a complete V.\u00a0 Don't go overboard and try to make it a pretty or uniform V, only go far enough that there are no gaps in the V.\u00a0 It will probably look something like this:\nNow, for Step 2 you will grind the outside along one side of that V parallel to the inside surface of the tip:\nYou need to know more than this illustration shows, though; you need to know how steep to make that cut.\u00a0 The best way I can describe it is:\u00a0 With the side of the tip against the grinding surface, the butt end of the handle should be about 2\" to 2-1/2\" above the grinding surface.\u00a0 This is presuming a Staedtler handle, which is about 6\" long overall.\nDon't try to grind the side of the gouge all the way to a sharp edge just yet.\u00a0 For one thing, if you're using a powered grinder, you'll most certainly burn the metal; the thinner the edge gets, the easier it is to overheat it.\u00a0 For now, just put a nice bevel on the outside surface of the gouge while leaving a narrow band of the original shiny surface remaining.\nNow, obviously, flip it over and do the other side the same way:\nWhen you're done with these flats, the gouge viewed from the side should have a flat that looks like this:\nNote that if the ground surface isn't shaped pretty much like that, you probably did something wrong.\nNext, hold the gouge right side up with the bottom of the nib against the grinding surface, with the end of the gouge almost flat against the surface -- just slightly nose-down, so the tip contacts first.\nWhile holding this position, grind just enough to create a flat on the bottom that is shaped like an elongated diamond.\u00a0 Do not, repeat DO NOT grind enough that you break through to the inside of the V at the tip!\u00a0 You do want to grind until the elongated diamond you are creating extends right up to the front of the nib, though, where the two sides you ground meet at the bottom of the V.\nNote:\u00a0 Both Staedtler and Speedball nibs come with the bottom ground to a rounded shape.\u00a0 In cutting this flat, I am recommending a departure from the original configuration.\u00a0 I have tried both ways, with a flat bottom and with a rounded bottom, and in my opinion the flat bottom works as well or even slightly better; the gouge has less tendency to fall into the groove you just cut.\u00a0 It's also much easier to grind a flat than a curved surface.\u00a0 You may, however, opt to roll the gouge side-to-side during this step to round the bottom the way the manufacturer did it.\nAfter you've finished this step, you're done with the grinder for now.\nSHARPENING: Hold the gouge with the tip against the surface of the hone and rolled onto one side, so that one side of the V is flat against the hone.\u00a0 The tip of the handle should be perhaps 2-1/2\" to 3\" above the honing surface, which you'll note is a bit higher than it was held in the grinding steps described above.\u00a0 This will have you honing just at the cutting edge rather that trying to move the entire bevelled surface.\nThe trick here is to have good light and good magnification to see what you're doing, and hold the gouge in one hand and the hone in the other.\u00a0 Firmly establish the position that you will be holding both.\u00a0 Bring them together and begin a honing motion (back and forth, circles, doesn't matter much) without changing those positions.\u00a0 Periodically stop and look at the polished area you have created, making sure that it is uniform along the edge and not concentrating too much at one corner or the other.\u00a0 If you find you've been leaning a bit crooked one way or the other, adjust and continue.\nIf you have ground a new tip on the gouge as described above and left a narrow strip of the flat front face during grinding, now is the time to bring that bevelled surface all the way to meet the inside surface of the V.\u00a0 Note that as you get close to the inside surface of the V you need to be applying only very light pressure on the hone.\u00a0 Too much pressure will push the thin edge right over.\u00a0 Even if it doesn't permanently deform it, it can bend it enough that the hone isn't creating the edge you're looking for; it's not polishing the edge itself because the edge has moved out of the way.\u00a0 Very light pressure is the secret to success here; let the hone and the motion do the work, don't try to rush it or force it.\nNote:\u00a0 If you have experience sharpening knives, you're probably alarmed at how steep these angles are.\u00a0 If you honed a knife at similar angles, it would end up with a pretty blunt edge indeed and wouldn't cut well at all.\u00a0 If you try to use the shallow angles commonly used in knife sharpening on a gouge, you'd end up with a very sharp gouge -- and you'd bend the edge over as soon as you tried to carve with it.\u00a0 The cutting edge on a gouge nib needs to have comparatively blunt angles to be strong enough to push into rubber and pry pieces out without getting damaged.\u00a0 The fact that the tip doesn't have that razor sharpness you get from honing at shallow angles isn't a problem because it's not difficult to push a gouge through rubber anyway.\nObviously, once done with one side of the V, roll the gouge the other way and do the other side.\nOnce you have both sides honed to form an actual cutting edge at the face of the V, you will know perfectly well how to hold the gouge with one side or the other against the hone while rubbing.\u00a0 Now do one more trick:\u00a0 While holding one side of the gouge against the hone and rubbing, slowly roll the gouge over to the other side, continuing the honing motion all the way.\u00a0 Keep the handle at about the same height through this process.\u00a0 When honing a Staedtler, the entire roll should take no more than a few seconds; it takes a bit longer on a Speedball because the bottom of the V isn't as crisply formed.\u00a0 When done, you can look at the bottom of the V and see what you've done.\u00a0 This step will round the corners where the flats on the sides and the elongated diamond flat on the bottom meet.\u00a0 This is a minor and quick step, but it makes all the difference in how well your gouge will carve because it's this area that slides across the rubber when carving.\nThe next step is to take your ceramic knife and position the edge of the knife down in the bottom of the V.\u00a0 The tip of the knife should be pointing toward the handle of the gouge.\u00a0 With the ceramic knife held in this position, roll it until one side of the knife is sitting flat against one side of the V of the gouge.\u00a0 Slide the knife in and out of the tip of the gouge a couple of times; the blade will probably come close to contacting the handle of the gouge.\u00a0 You may notice a gray smudge appearing on the white ceramic knife; that's metal particles being rubbed away.\u00a0 Roll the knife over the other way and polish the other side of the V the same way.\u00a0 And, just for good measure, stand the ceramic knife up straight, centered between the two sides of the V, and make a few more in-and-out sliding motions with the sharp edge of the knife working on the bottom of the V only.\nThis treatment with the ceramic knife only takes ten seconds or so.\u00a0 Two or three slides each way is plenty.\u00a0 It absolutely must be the last thing done to the cutting edge of the gouge, though.\u00a0 If you decide the work on the outside isn't quite right and you want to go back and hit it some more, be sure to repeat the inside honing with the ceramic knife when you're done.\nA MINOR GOUGE MODIFICATION: Your gouge is done, but I recommend one more step.\u00a0 Hold your gouge with one side of the tip against a grinder or hone (either works here) as shown:\nYou'll need to use the corner of a grinder or hone for this task, because you need to get down low enough that both the broad part of the nib and the handle would be contacting the grinding surface.\u00a0 Grind away the side of the tip as shown.\u00a0 When viewed from the side, the resulting flat will be a triangle with a long straight side along the top edge of the gouge tip and the peak pointing downward.\u00a0 The forward end of this triangle should not meet the cutting edge!\u00a0 Get it up close to the cutting edge and quit.\u00a0 Obviously, repeat for the other side.\nThese cuts do not affect the cutting edge at all; the cutting edge is not involved -- that's why it doesn't matter if you use the hone or grinder.\u00a0 What this modification does is make the tip visibly narrower, which means it's easier to see what you're carving because there's less gouge in your line of sight.\u00a0 You'll be surprised at how much it helps.\u00a0 And it's quick and easy to do.\nThe completed gouge should have 5 \"facets\" around the outside.\u00a0 Two triangles, two trapezoids, and one elongated diamond.\nYou're done.\u00a0 Using a scrap piece of carving rubber, take a couple of trial cuts and see how it works.\u00a0 I usually start by jamming the tip deep into the rubber to clean it; pull it out of the rubber and it leaves smudges of metal particles all around the cut.\u00a0 If you have a jeweler's loupe or similar 10X magnifier, you can inspect your work.\u00a0 The important thing is that you haven't left any of the original shiny flat face, which would be dull.\u00a0 It's pretty easy to tell if you have, though, by holding the gouge in such a way that your light would shine on it.\u00a0 When there's no more shine, you know you're looking at a sharp edge.\n"}, {"score": 240.30966, "uuid": "c28c03da-1fa4-5fa9-b554-7d28d6228231", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0107wb-31-33916", "target_hostname": "www.elighters.com", "target_uri": "http://www.elighters.com/vash901.html", "page_rank": 1.3629092e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Visol &quot;Maho&quot;

Don&#x27;t drop them in the sink <em>or</em> use them to open can lids, you&#x27;ll break them.", "explanation": null, "document": "There are a lot of kitchen gadgets out there. Honestly, although neat, you don't need the mass majority of them.\u00a0 Contained in this list are the basic items I think every vegan should have to create great meals.\nCast Iron Skillet\nTired of your tofu sticking? Worried you aren't getting enough Iron in your diet? Don't have time to go to the gym and lift weights? A good cast iron skillet is the solution! Why people ever stopped using them for everyday use I'll never understand. They work best for browning, frying, camp cooking, and pretty much anything else you'd use a skillet for. They do require a bit of extra care to maintain the \"seasoning\" that keeps them non-stick, but trust me, it's worth it. Both Lodge and Le Creuset make great pre-seasoned options. Invest a few dollars in a good quality one, plus take the 30 extra seconds after washing, to oil the surface and you'll have it for a lifetime. You can also find them at second hand stores, if you don't mind the extra work of re-seasoning them.\nGood Quality Kitchen Knives\nEven if you only purchase a Chef's Knife and Paring Knife, please buy good quality blades. You'll save yourself time, effort, money in the long run, and yourself from possible trips to the emergency room. There are several great companies out there but, Wusthof , J.A. Henckels , and Kyocera , are my favorites. If you go with traditional stainless steel blades, be sure to purchase a sharpener by the same company. Their sharpeners are set to hone the edge to the specific angle of their knives. Using a sharpener from a different company will offset your blade. If you aren't interested in having to maintain your blades, Kyocera Ceramic Knives are a great option, as the non-porous material doesn't dull like steel. The big drawback of ceramic is that they're a bit delicate. Don't drop them in the sink or use them to open can lids, you'll break them.\nFood Processor\nHow on earth I went so many years without a food processor in my kitchen, I'll never know. Its easily the hardest working small appliance in my house. I use it for sauces, dips, dough, chopping, mincing, slicing, and blending. Again this is something you want to invest some money in. You really can't go wrong with a Cuisinart , considering they introduced the world to the food processor. They have several size and function options to choose from. My personal favorite is their Prep 11 Plus, its basic, but it has everything you need. Kitchenaid also has several good options. I recently got to demo their new 13 Cup with ExactSlice, and if you plan to do a lot of slicing, this is the one to go with. It works amazing and you can control the slice thickness with an exterior switch instead of the hassle of taking it apart.\nStock Pot\nA good stock pot is a wonderful thing. For everyday use an 8 quart is the perfect size. It's just right for soups, pasta sauce, rice, mashed potatoes, etc... Look for a pot that has a heavy bottom, as this will cut down on any sticking. I like Calphalon's Simply Calphalon 8 qt. Multi-purpose Stockpot, as it comes with a steamer basket and pasta insert for a reasonable price. If you'd like to get into canning, look for a 20 quart pot, like this one from Nordic Ware.\nBamboo Steamer\nWant perfectly steamed veggies, dumplings, or a great way to keep tortillas warm for burritos? Grab a 10 inch Bamboo Steamer from Joyce Chen. They're inexpensive and seriously come in handy. I use mine for steaming homemade seitan, savory and sweet dumplings, and for quick and easy steamed veggies on nights when I'm not in a cooking mood.\nI also suggest some heavy duty baking sheets and pans, a silicone collapsible strainer, a counter top compost bin, and a good quality blender. You'll find you have little use for much else and don't have to replace things as often, if at all, when you invest in a few quality items.\nAshley Kiefer | Facebook | Blog\nRapid City, SD Ashley is is an artist and avid vegan cook.

As Emerson -\nThe #1 Hard Use Knife In The World\n, I sortta disagree on that one, but I'll discuss it a little bit later :) High end, quality(which sometimes is not a match to its retail price), rather expensive production knife. Materials used in Commander are pretty much standard in today's high-end knives, such as ATS-34 steel (now 154CM steel ) steel blade, G-10 scales & titanium liners, and of course the price tag, with retail at hefty 220$ :), As usual, you can get one much cheaper on the net - around 150$, though you're out of luck if you wanted a left handed model, my understanding is Emerson doesn't allow dealers to sell left handed version. By now, which is 2001 you can get roughly the same package (G10+ATS-34/154CM/Ti LinerLock) a lot cheaper, but it obviously won't be\nThe Emerson\n, in case that is important to you.\nBlade\n- I like Commander's recurve blade. It is rather wide. Matter of fact, out of all my folding knives, Commander has the widest one, even though the blade itself is relatively short, only 3.75 inches long, it is thick & it is wide. It sure looks impressive :). At the base it is has the same thickness as BM 710 Axis Lock , but closer to the tip it is still thick unlike 710, although for example Cold Steel Gunsite has even thicker base. Given all that, I think the blade has to be quite strong, and will probably withstand significant loads, not so sure about the handle the liner lock. In general recurve blade improves cutting ability, although they are more difficult to sharpen, but Edge-Pro Apex , Spyderco Sharpmaker 204 , or a simple ceramic sharpening rod will do the job.\nOne well known problem is that the pivot screw has a tendency to get loose over time. Happens on many other folders as well, but on the Emerson seems to be more frequent, and part of the design. The fix is theoretically easy, adjust it and apply the loctite. BTW applying loctite doesn't seem to be a good solution for the Commander at least. According to EKI the slotted screws are used for ease of maintenance and field stripping. In short either that pivot screw gets loose occasionally, or you give up the field striping ability. Although, to be honest, I am not entirely convinced, well, rather suspicious about the usefulness of the folding knife field stripping ability at all. During the time this site has been up, that's over 12 years by now, I've had numerous email exchanges with deployed servicemen, LEOs and other knife collectors and enthusiasts, don't really remember anyone giving prize to any folder for the ease of field stripping, simply because it's really unusual to do that with a folding knife. The need of the field stripping is highly unlikely in other words. I agree, it's very easy to loosen that screw without proper tools, but the only thing you will remove is the blade, and in the field conditions putting those washers back, plus you can't remove the smaller screws without a screwdriver anyway. My Commander has another problem too. Whenever I adjust the pivot to eliminate horizontal blade play, it becomes difficult to open with one hand. That problem has its solution as well, which was covered on Bladeforums, to overcome the opening difficulties and have no blade play you'll have to adjust second ball detent. I haven't tried that one, too much hassle for a knife that I don't use.\nWhat I dislike the most is the chisel edge on the Commander's blade. EKI website states that the blade is V ground, which is correct, but somewhat misleading to many. The edge is a chisel ground , in other words only one side (unfortunately left) is sharpened. Back then, in 2001 when I wrote the initial review, I was quite unhappy with the chisel grind edges. Since then, I've learned how to use them properly, thanks to my interest in Japanese Kitchen Knives , since most and the best of them do sport chisel grind edges. However, my initial assessment and complaint still stands. While chisel grind itself is not a real problem, even though there is a learning curve, it's not neither steep nor long, mainly making straight cuts is an issue, but EKI puts the edge on the wrong side. And we're back to square one. It doesn't make much difference if you are using this knife for stabbing type motions, but for cutting, it is a problem. Outdoor knife as usual means something used mainly for cutting, not just stabbing/fighting.\nI don't want to discuss here pros and cons of a chisel grind. This topic has been discussed numerous times on the Bladeforums. Most of the chisel opponents agree that when the chisel grind is on the proper side for the user(that'd be your working hand side), it can be very useful for certain cutting applications, e.g. Japanese chef's knives with right sided chisel blades used for slicing fish etc. Otherwise chisel edges are in general weaker, and more importantly, it's more difficult to make straight cuts with chisel edges. Quoting the famous knifemaker R.J. Martin:\nFor a right handed user, the grind should be on the Right hand side of the blade. This is based on the fact that most cutting is done away from the user, holding the item being cut in the left hand. For food preparation, a chisel grind done on the right hand side is ideal, because the flat side of the blade goes up against the fingertips of the left hand, and the slices of food being cut are pushed off to the right.\nI think that summarizes chisel thing very well. Unfortunately, in many production and non production chisel ground blades the picture is exactly the opposite - the edge is on the left side, thus making it very inconvenient for the right handed public. As of why it is there, explanations vary ;)\nAnd finally the Emerson Knife company in their FAQ states their opinion:\nQ. Why do you put the chisel on the front or left side of the blade?\nThis is an Emerson signature. Being the knifemaker who brought the chisel grind to worldwide recognition, we are often asked; Why do you put the grind on the opposite side of a traditional Japanese Chef's knife? The answer is simple....We are not making chef's knives. Our knives are hard knives meant for hard users. We do not cut many tomatoes. Our tests and those of a major government agency determined that there was no difference between right and left side grinds for use as a tool or weapon. The left side was chosen for purposes of visual cue and reference.\nSome of it sounds quite entertaining :)\nOur Tests\n, and that mysterious\nmajor government agency\n... I have no idea, who was testing and in what manner is was done, so that he(or they) couldn't tell the chisel grind edge was on the wrong side :), especially when referring to the use of a knife as a tool. Anyways, in the end it says it, for visual cue. Since the maker's logo is on the left side traditionally, you put the edge there and make look good on the pictures. Obviously that will not add anything to knife's cutting ability and overall performance. Well, until it sells and has it's customers why not :). In the end, it's up to you to decide, for more info check the Bladeforums. And last, but not the least, for the maker the chisel edges are easier and cheaper to produce. Only one side to grind.\nLock\n- For the tactical knife (or fighting, or whatever marketing term you use for it) one would definitely want a stronger locking mechanism than the liner lock Commander has. IMHO the knife which is marketed as a tactical should perform according to certain requirements. Potentially that includes strong impacts, excessive lateral loads, torqueing, etc. I mean, if you engage in knife fight you can't really predict what's gonna happen. Unfortunately the liners are too thin(0.050\" or 1.15 mm) on the Commander, which compromises the strength of the lock. Considering that a lot of folks consider liner locks excessively failure prune(and there are too many reports of all sorts of liner lock failures too prove the point), the overall picture doesn't look promising. Here's Emerson knives official position:\n\"... 0.050\" is the industry standard...\"\n. Personally I have hard time believing in that. None of my folders have liners that thin. Even 40$ Beretta Airlight folder has thicker, hardened steel liners, let alone Benchmade Ares , 710 Axis Strider, REKAT, MT SOCOM etc. Most of the folders listed have hardened steel liners thicker than 0.050\" (bear in mind to make something as strong from Titanium you'll need approx. twice as much of Ti), and some even have aluminum handles. Anyway, your fingers are your business, so don't take my word for it, check different knife forums to hear all sides :)\nCoating\n- Some claim that the Teflon coating on the Commander blade is better than Benchmade BT-2 . I have no idea why would that be, theoretically, it's something based on the same teflon. I haven't used my Commander as much as my Benchmade folding knives , so no direct comparison. Got some stains on it after piercing a can of coke with my Commander, that's it.\nHandle\n- One of the good things of this knife is the handle ergonomics :) Very, very good. Really comfortable, provides excellent grip. The finger groove & the notched thumb ramp(which is the wave, or a part of it) are really nice additions. G10 scales have no sharp edges, and the texture is well defined, yet very comfortable(not excessively abrasive like e.g. Strider Buck ). On the downside have to mention the thin liners. Haven't seen myself but 98/99 Commanders had the thicker liners and in general, 0.062\" vs. 0.050\". Therefore stronger handles. Not sure why Emerson choose to thin the liners, probably to resolve the thick handle issue, if there was one. Here's a quote from the thread linked below:\nthe liners are so thin you can easily bend the knife with your bare hands. During a trip visiting a huge knife wholesaler, I inspected over a dozen of them and the blade scraped the liner when opening with the thumbstud on every one due to the flimsy construction\n.\n- And the best part of this knife, the Wave. Quoting Emerson:\nThe Emerson Wave (patent pending) makes it the fastest deploying knife ever.\n, basically what it does is allows you to deploy your knife using your pocket, or a sheath, looks like a bottle cap opener, but does the job very well. BTW frequently\nWaving\nwhile being addictive, is very destructive to your pockets ;). Some question what advantage does those milliseconds give in the combat situation, considering that you still have to get the proper grip etc. If you are interested, I guess you should check out one of the many tactical forums. Anyway, it's a cool feature :). If you don't want to use the Wave or flick, then there's a disk opener. Many find it more comfortable than studs and opening hole. The stud on my Commander got loose after wave openings, nothing lethal, the problem can be fixed with a drop of the loctite, but anyway. There were other reports with the same issue, you can check bladeforums and rec.knives newsgroup for that matter. According to Emerson enthusiasts the problem has been fixed since then.\nSummary\n- Well, in the end I am not exactly excited about Commander. It was not a good idea to buy it before handling it. On the other hand, it's ok for the collection and for learning ;) I have several reasons that make Commander not suitable for everyday carry to me:\nSize - Commander is some wide piece for a folding knife, wearing it in your jeans pocket is quite inconvenient.\nBlade grind- Chisel grind, that Commander is featuring, is not exactly suited for the utility use, although it's good for self defense, still normal V grind would've been more preferable.\nLock - I do not like linerlocks. I've discussed other issues with Commander locks above. The complaint is about liner locks in general, and multiples reports regarding liner lock failures on different knives including Emerson's, do not inspire any confidence in them.\nLength - One more thing about the blade, IMHO 3.75 inches is too small for the blade length. some extra .20-.25 inches at least could make a good difference.\nWell, basically that's all regarding Emerson Commander as my personal EDC issues, obviously you will have yours, not necessarily matching mine :). Overall, personally to me, it is a cool looking knife, but practically useless for utility purposes(which are primary for me). For some people Emerson knives are #1 hard use knives, and Emerson is\nthe most respected knifemaker on the earth\nas he declared himself ;) I don't believe in either, IMHO it's mainly hype. I like several of Emerson designs a lot, but then again, liner locks, chisel grind edges on the wrong side, thin liners :(((\nSpecifications:\n"}, {"score": 237.72452, "uuid": "146c622d-223f-5080-bb4a-54991e3e69df", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1711wb-37-03491", "target_hostname": "wickededgeusa.com", "target_uri": "http://wickededgeusa.com/index.php?page=shop.product_details&category_id=65&flypage=flypage.pbv.v1.tpl&product_id=180&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=82&showall=1", "page_rank": 1.2285322e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "Wicked Edge Precision Sharpener", "snippet": "<em>I</em> started with the vise, red, yellow, blue diamond files and a set of strops.

Best of all there is absolutely no learning\ncurve; you will achieve phenomenal results right out of the box!!! It is quick and convenient and there is no fuss or mess and it is very easy to\nuse. You do not need any practice or special skills to get a razor edge right out of the box. You are sharpening both sides of the blade at once so it\neasily cuts the time in half of what it would take you with other sharpeners. You can change a diamond grit in the blink of an eye! One of the very\nbest features is that you can place a knife back into the sharpener in the exact same position each and every time, which is great for quick edge\ntouch ups. This is paramount when touching up your edge. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to start at square one with a coarse diamond grit each time you place\nthe blade in the sharpener. This is key to a long service life of the knife. The Wicked Edge allows you to maintain a razor edge while shaving off the\nleast amount of metal each time. Additionally, you are not limited by just a few blade angles as with other sharpeners, you have a wide range of 15 to\n30 degrees. I now maintain a log with all my knifes and the specific information for each knife to be placed in the exact location on the sharpener\neach and every time it is loaded. If any of this seems complicated, it is not, it is all intuitive. You will find yourself so pleased with the\nresults that you will be calling your friends to sharpen their knifes! Believe me, this is one fantastic sharpener! If you are serious about having\nthe sharpest edge possible on your knives then this is the sharpener you need to own! No more shipping your knifes back to the factory to get that\nrazor edge! As far as I am concerned, The Wicked Edge Team are the village wizards! I tip my hat to the designers of this sharpener, so simple, yet\nhighly functional and ultra effective! It is well made and sturdy, truly the last sharpening system I will ever have to or need to purchase. n\nnWhere can I buy some stock!

The design makes the best and longest lasting edge that I have ever seen. I have used several\ndifferent sharpeners with marginal success and marginal edges. Anyone can sharpen a razor edge on any knife in very little time. As a professional\nhunting guild I had to carry four or five knifes before the wicked edge knife sharpener came into my life, now I carry one and can do several elk at a\ntime without stopping to reshape the edge. I love it. I have even sharpened all of my kitchen knives as well. Now I look for any excuse to touch up my\nknives. The wicked edge knife sharpener makes sharpening a fun and quick job.

I have been using it now for all of three days and I already have the hang of it. I started on my knives to learn on then\nwent strait for my Wife's twin-man professional Henckels. Long story short, my wife is super pleased with how they turned out (translation: money well\nspent according to the Boss!). The quality of the sharpener is second to none and after each use I am more pleased with it. As I have used other\nclamp/vice type sharpening products in the past, I was a little bit concerned that the clamp might not hold the blade straight and in the same\nposition every time, but you guys nailed that one in spades- the WE clamp is so adjustable and versatile. I tried blades of varying thicknesses from\nless than 1/8th inch thick to around a quarter inch thick with varying taper angles. Your clamp held them perfectly and snugly with no room for error.\nI can't wait till you develop the chisel attachment. Thanks again, and God bless. nCapt Tom Brannan USMC\njim.stevenson\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nClay; I have received the remaining stones and Strops for my Wicked Edge.

I purchased the WE this past weekend at the Colorado Springs Gun Show (April 6 09). I have read books on knife sharpening, I have\ndiamond, ceramic and Arkansas stones of all grades of grit, I have all kinds of steels and other sharpening devices. At best I can get a decent edge\nusing these but they don't compare or come close to the razor edge the WE gives. The fine ceramic stones were not in stock but I plan to purchase\nthose when they become available. I was given the leather strops as part of the purchase. I would consider those essential to a fine edge and assume\nthe fine ceramic stones will become essential once I have them.

Finally a system to fulfill my quest for the perfect edge. Years have been spent and many systems have been bought.\nYet perfection was never attained until now. Wicked edge has perfected a system to put a razor sharp edge on most of my knives. The key is its\ninherrent quality construction which allows the diamond stones to be applied at the precise angle on both sides of the blade. Furthermore, Wicked Edge\nhas eliminated user error with a system that insures consistancy by only a modicum of skill on behalf of the operator. I believe a certain amount of\nskill is necessary, in that the left hand needs to replicate the movement of the right (for a right handed person) however this can quickly be learned\nand is fun once the proper rythym is achieved. The one drawback with this system however would be its inability to sharpen serrated and concave\nblades. So I guess I'll have to keep my Spyderco Sharpmaker. Overall though I'm extremely happy with the Wicked Edge Sharpener, so much so that I\norder both the extra rough and fine stones to get an even sharper edge. Hey, that says it all in my opinion.\nhharris\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nWicked Edge Customer Service is superlative!

My frustration was the ability to get the perfect edge and sharpness. At the NRA\nConvention in Phoenix I was very impressed with the Wicked Edge Sharpener I bought one on the spot and have ordered the additional accessories. After\nthey arrived, I got busy and I have to say that I am totally blown away at the quality and ease of putting that perfect edge on my knife. I took my\nfavorite knife that had a 25 degree edge and decided to change it to a 23 degree edge. At first I was ready to cry once I saw what the quick results\nof the coarse stone did (which is the way it was designed)but in very short order progressing through the finer stones I achieved that perfect edge\nand a mirror finish on the blade. I have nothing but positive things to say about this knife sharpener. The only thing that would make this better is\nto have an IPO and go public as I would buy your stock.\ninfo\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nVery nice sharpener, was able to put a razor sharp edge on every knife in my house the afternoon that I received it. The only drawbacks that I see at\nthis point are: 1) I'm unable to sharpen some of my smaller pocket knives (ie. Buck Deuce) because the top of the blade doesn't clear the top of the\nclamp enough. 2) haven't found a way to hold a few blades that are only sharpened on one side--the clamp holds the blade at an angle. In these two\ncases, I can't use it, but I hardly use those anyway, for the knives I actually use, this puts a very usable/repeatable edge on them quite quickly.\nrdkoontz\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nI am very happy with the Wicked Edge Sharpener, it is the best sharpener that I have. nI have tried many other sharpeners, the other two best\nsharpeners I used to use was the Lansky and Tormek both had flaws for me. The Lansky had issues of not holding on to the blade and it would move\naround and the bevel on both sides would not come out even. The Tormek which now sells for in the $500 neighborhood, would grind to high a bevel on\nthe tips of smaller knives. The Tormek messed up the bevel at the tip of a Chris Reeves small Sebenza knife I had to send it back to Chris to have it\nfixed. n I also want to mention the customer service of Wicked Edge is excellent even after I have purchased the system and had it for awhile, I sent\ne-mail requesting help and they have always answered my e-mails with helpful information. I would recommend this system to anyone who is looking for a\nreally good sharpener. I am a knife collector, and make knives, so I am always looking for the ultimate knife sharpening system.

So I began reading about the art of knife sharpening on the internet\nand suddenly realized there was an overload of information. Everyone had opinions about what was the best way to do the job. Since I have gotten to be\nan senior citizen and my hands are a little shakey I decided on getting some sort of sharpening guide and purchased a Lansky standard diamond system.\nImmediately realized that the principal was great, but there had to be a more user friendly device out there some where, Back to the internet I go and\nnarrow my choices to the Edge Pro Apex and the Wicked Edge system. About the time I was poised to make the purchase I happened upon a You Tube demo of\na highly dissatisfied Wicked Edge customer and was almost completely turned off to the Wicked Edge system. I called and talked to Clay Allison at\nWicked Edge and got his side of the story and decided to make the purchaseand I couldn't more pleased with the decision. The Wicked Edge system has\nmade a knife sharpener out of me and if it has done that for me it can do it for anyone. If you have been turned of by the You Tube slamming of the\nWicked Edge. Think about this, the guy has been offered his money back and still wants to keep the system. If it was as bad as he claims why would he\ndo that. I also find that the customer service and shipping is top notch at Wicked Edge. Put me down on the satisfied customer list and for sure I\nhave not been paid or coerced to make this statement.\njbaltzley\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nJoe, I purchased the wicked edge mainly to get my D2 steel hunting knives sharp...a task I had trouble with previously. I started with the vise, red,\nyellow, blue diamond files and a set of strops. The darn thing works so well, I bought a base and ceramics and well, I am out of stuff to buy.\nAnecdotally, I skinned and boned three deer without sharpening my two knives (caping and large hunting). Not until about halfway through the last deer\ndid I start noticing my knives getting dull. Just touching hair with them, caused it to pop away freely. Cutting the skin around the ankles was very\neasy to do and this is a task that can be a little difficult with a dull knife. I will have to adjust to using a knife this sharp. What a pleasure. So\nmany times I will purchase a product with hopes that it will work. So many times it doesn't work. I want you to tell your customers that this product\nWORKS. It will quickly make their knives scalpel sharp. Once sharpened, a knife can be retuned very quickly with minimal metal removal. I haven't\ntried the ceramics, but I would not be happy with the result without use of the strops after finishing with the purple stone. I haven't used smaller\nthan 10um media on mine and it only takes a few strokes to get the edge I desire. Todd\nebuckner\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nAwesome!! I have bought every possible sharpener on the market. Sharpmaker, Lansky deluxe diamond system, Apex edge pro. ect.... The Wicked edge hands\ndown beats them all. At least for me. I'm not a person with a lot of finesse when it comes to using my left hand. With this, the use of my non\ndominate hand is limited and controlled. Set up is way easy and the learning curve is excellent! The other sharpeners are fine products but the wicked\nedge is the one for me. Do yourself a favor and include the granite base. No lie, this is the best money I've ever spent on a sharpener.\nfree122\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nDear Clay, n nThe new arms are awesome. What a difference! Thank you for the arms and new vise. n nI sharpened a knife for a guide in Ohio, on 154\nsteel, and the knife is still sharp after 5 deer! He can't believe it. n nI can actually sharpen knives to a point where I am able to pick out and\ncut individual hairs on my arm. Last night, I collected all my previous sharpeners to give or throw away. n nI typically don't get this excited, but\ndull knives and butchered sharpening jobs by \"professionals\" have been a frustration of mine for 26 years of hunting, and now that issue has been\nsolved conclusively. Whether hunting knives or kitchen cutlery, you can't beat the product. n nThat's it-I'm done, but I did want to express my\nhappiness with your product and service.\njacklinda\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nDear Clay, nI'm always the skeptic unless proven wrong--and this time I've been proven WRONG. I think I've owned every sharpening system out there,\nEdge Pro, Tormek, Lansky, etc; but none of them have really grasped the engineering concept that you have to maintain a consistant edge on both sides\nas you have. I know it is easy now to produce a quality edge on the average knife, so when I got mine the other day I decided to put it to the \"real\ntest\" of some of the type of knives I own, that heretofore, have been difficult to get a respectable edge on--consistently respectable edge. n nI\ndon't know if you are familiar with Talonite? A different steel that is not know for easy sharpening. The diamond stones (from anybody) will cut\nTalonite, but the precise engineering of the knife holder and the dual adjustable cutting degrees of your product is what will set you above the rest!\nI've sharpened my Talonite folder and developed a better edge than when it came new! Any BG42 grind will challenge a sharpening system, especially\nwhen the factory grind was offset in the first place! No sweat with the Wicked Edge! Finally, I had purchased a damascus folder that for the life of\nme I couldn't get a decent edge on. I gave up on it as an every day carry simply because I couldn't get it sharpened to what I thought it should be.\nOnce again no sweat with the Wicked Edge! n nOthers can comment on the price you charge but until they put this one in their shop, talk is cheap. I'm\na knife maker for over 20 years and always knew I could get a better edge on my hunting knives, but most was hit and miss. Now there is no miss! this\none is spot on target. Build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door! Your biggest problem will be keeping sufficient stock on\nhand. Congratulations! n nI've just ordered the last of the stones that you offer with this package and I am very happy with your product! Anyone who\nhas dealt with the myriad of sharpeners on the market can use yours and instantly see the time and added expense your team took to deliver a product\nthat will last. I am most impressed with the precise engineering. Feel free to post this if you chose on your testimonial page, as I am one happy\ncamper with your product. n nDan M nOverland Park, KS\ns_olson23\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nClay, I received my order Thursday thanks! I'm leaving for my fishing trip tomorrow but I just had to take a moment to write you. I tried the Wicked\nEdge on my lockblade and I can finally say for the FIRST time in my life that I have truly sharpened a knife. Shaving sharp is an understatement. When\nI tested the edge, the hair on my arm just fell away. My wife is laughing at me because I don't have any hair left on my arms to test with; think I'll\ntry shaving the dog next. I'm an avid outdoorsman and I have sharpened my fair share of knives. I've owned all kinds of sharpeners and have NEVER\nachieved an edge that even comes close to what I was able to do with the Wicked Edge. Operator error is virtually removed from the process; my 11-year\nold sharpened his small bait knife and produced the same 'wicked' result as me. He was upset with me because I insisted on dulling the edge before\ngiving it back to him. You have designed and built one fine piece of equipment, I couldn't be more satisfied.\nsincorvaia72159\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nThis review comes after over a year of use during which I have used my Wicked Edge Sharpener to set edge angles on 2 Swamp Rat Waki swords, 2 Busse\nNMSFNOs, 2 Busse SAQs, 1 Busse SAR5, plus 4 other Bussekins, and a number of custom made and production hard use knives, such as Strider and Landi,\nand 9x 154CM fighters. Setting an edge angle takes a great deal of work when you have uneven factory edges on HARD - hard use knives that vary. Each\nWaki took around 2 days of work to get to a 25 degrees shaving sharp even edge. Never in that time did the Wicked Edge not perform as advertised. Now\nit takes me less than 5 mins in total to maintain each of my blades, keeping them sharp and ready. The best part is that this outstanding performance\ncomes with a warranty that matches my knives, and with a level of customer service and support that is simply outstanding.\ninfo\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nMy sharpener arrived yesterday, and to say I was excited is an understatement. After years of inability on my part to get a truly sharp edge on my\nknives, that all changed after about 6 minutes of use with this rig. I put my prize Fallkniven PXL folder in the vise and closely followed Clay's\nexcellent instructions.The results were amazing...this blade made of very hard (Rockwell 62)laminated 3G powder steel came out hair-popping sharp\nafter the final lapping with the leather hones.It sliced paper and para cord with an aplomb that was truly satisfying. At last, a sharpener that does\neverything advertised and does it in spades. Awesome! The term scary sharp now has new meaning to me! nMy total experience with the Wicked Edge from\nstart to finish has been extremely positive. As if it isn't enough that the shapener itself is wonderful, the service rendered by Clay is excellent\nand way beyond what one has come to expect in this day and age. Wonderful service Clay and a truly wonderful tool you and your partner have given to\nall of us frustrated knife owners! Frustrations be gone! nNow on to the rest of my knives. More later! nWith many thanks, nLeo\nDStrickland\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nI hope you don't mind part 2 reviews Clay but I think this one is important.Use it if you want. nAfter the success of my first knife sharpening, today\nI went on my merry way with my second sharpening and the knife edge was simply miserable! What had I done wrong? I went back and analyzed my actions\nand I was shame-faced to find I had broken almost every instruction given by Clay. nFirst I over-tightened the top screw which led to the knife not\nholding its position it slipped after the first few strokes. Once I got that fixed, I went on not reading the instructions and did not raise a burr\nproperly...I didn't check with a cotton swab to see if the burr was there neither on the right nor the left side of the bevel. Then to top off my\ncarelessness, I had not set the angle adjusting screw tightly into the detente dimple at the 20 degree mark and so I was merrily stroking the blade\nwhile the right hand angled rod was moving freely at various positions. I couldn't have been more careless. nI went back and did the whole thing over\nagain and this time followed the instructions to the letter...a piece of cake and another smooth, slicing blade, especially after using the leather\nstrops and Diamond Paste. Excellent stuff. Thanks again Clay! Leo July 24 2010 Ontario, Canada\ninfo\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nClay, n Thanks so much. I finally got my sharpener from ordering it at the blade show. It's everything I thought it would be and more. I've been a\nLansky user for over 25 years. The Wicked Edge Sharpener is the ULTIMATE in knife sharpening. n I can't say enough about the versatility and adjust\nability of your (my) Sharpener. I was really excited to get the WEPS, but after using it the first day, I'm more impressed than I ever thought I would\nbe. The WEPS trues up every bevel and tip to perfection! Unbelievable! I new you had a great product when I saw it and talked to you at the Blade\nShow, but it has far exceeded all of my expectations. n Thanks Again, now I will make sure I have the rest of your accessories. Please make a travel\ncase to hold everything, as I need to take it everywhere I go.\nsnctool\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nI have a bag of quality knives, in particular sevaral hard steel Knives of Alaska and my vintage case hardened Buck Pathfinder, circa 1968. These old\nBucks were represented by the company with a logo showing a hammer punching them through bolts of steel (Buck abandoned the logo with the\nmodernization and softer steel). These hard Bucks can be sharpended but usually wore down poor stones, only hard Arkansas with hours of precision\nhoning would sharpen these. I am skilled and practiced at knife sharpening with the old Buck Hone Master and Arkansas stones. It takes a steady hand\nand constant angle. My knives were always razor sharp. Now they are sharper, all in one afternoon. nThis machine is incredible the impossible to\nsharpen Buck sharpened up in 15 minutes at 18 degrees with the extra stones and strops, The hair did not shave off me, it rolled and peeled off my\nhair shins as if it melted. Paper peeled off the blade with no resistance at all, no drag, not even the slightest. nI always wear two steel/kevlar\ngloves,even in the field this knife is sharper than surgical scapels right now. Never use a knive this sharp without protecting yourself against a\nslip. nWhen I clean fish it often enough is 50 or so 4-5#, It takes 5 or 6 different knives, each for a particular cut and job. nI am not the average\nknife user and appreciate the personal advice and tutoring and recommended stones and process, thank you, Clay. nThe world, in my view, has been\nwaiting 42 years for this device. $400 well spent, order #613.\ninsnekamkze86\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nGreat system, but extremely disspointed in the service of this company.

First, I had an issue with notification and shipping, and I\nmust say that WE has some of the best customer support I have ever dealt with. They not only met my expectations in this area, but also exceeded them.\nTop notch company with regards to customer service. Second, they didn't have a base in stock when I originally ordered, so I made my own.\nUnfortunately, it wasn't perfect and I had an issue or two getting a really good edge on the knives I was trying to sharpen. Clay sent me another link\nor two with more information and perhaps another video to watch. I readjusted my mounting surface and tried again. The results are sensational. I'm a\nknife sharpening idiot. Plain & simple. nThis Wicked Edge system is revolutionary! Within 3 minutes, using just the 100/200, 400/600 stones, and both\nsets of strops, my pocket knife's edge is keen enough to shave arm smooth. And this is with a home made mount that isn't perfect. I recently ordered\nthe super fine ceramic stones and a real base to mount the system to. All I need now is for them to get the 800/1000 grit stones in stock, and I'm\nquite confident I'll be able to slice & dice my veggies like the pros, with a Wicked Edge of my own on all my knives. Thanks again for creating a\nproduct that is so simple to use, so precise, that I get a Wicked Edge every time. Sincerely, Roger Morris\njim\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nMy dad purchased this knife sharpening system for himself and for me to use (son). I am a cook and always have a knife in my hand. I can't explain how\nimportant a sharp knife is. We have all stones from 100 grit to the super fine ones. I have the sharpest knife you have ever seen or used. I'm\nactually sharpening the other cooks knives now. I can get a week of non stop use before having to resharpen and it only takes minutes! This system is\ngreat. I would say that if you are going to use it as much as I do, you need a better grade tightening bolts. The other ones strip easy. Overall, this\nis a great system and I plan on getting one for myself in the near future.\nmschroeder\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nI have always prided myself in my knives being sharp. I went to a store in Arizona and some guy offered to sharpen my knife, he swore by this system.\nSure enough that SOB had my knife sharper, and quicker then I could have done it using my free stones. I purchased one of these sharpening systems\nsoon after and I have not been let down this product is amazing. My only complaint is that my very small knives (pocket knives) I cannot use in this\nsystem without roughing the edges on the tip of this. But other than that this works amazing for my hunting knives and fillet blades. My buddies are\nin awe about how sharp my knives are at all times now... Thank you so much for making this product and striving to always improve it. I had a slight\ndelay in shipping back in June, but Wicked edge was more than polite and kept me up to date with my purchase.

It is extremely simple to use and it's much faster and more precise than anything else I've\nused to date. My knives are sharper than they have ever been and that's in half the time that it usually takes. The only reason I am giving this four\nstars instead of five is that the thumb screws seem to loosen sometimes. That is just as much user error as anything else because I need to be\nchecking the angle constantly, but I sometimes forget to and I will look down and see that the sharpening angle is about ten degrees different than\nwhat I started with. Overall, the best sharpening system out there. Really, nothing beats it.\nfaschn\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nIt seems highly suspicious that all the reviews have 5-stars.

(The video shows most everything except how to mount the knife - about as difficult as turning a screwdriver.)\nEngineering is solid!\narcticdreamer\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nRazor sharp, (hair shaving) edges that are acquired quickly and conveniently with no hassle or mess!!! Best of all there is absolutely no learning\ncurve; you will achieve phenomenal results right out of the box!!! It is quick and convenient and there is no fuss or mess and it is very easy to\nuse. You do not need any practice or special skills to get a razor edge right out of the box. You are sharpening both sides of the blade at once so it\neasily cuts the time in half of what it would take you with other sharpeners. You can change a diamond grit in the blink of an eye! One of the very\nbest features is that you can place a knife back into the sharpener in the exact same position each and every time, which is great for quick edge\ntouch ups. This is paramount when touching up your edge. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to start at square one with a coarse diamond grit each time you place\nthe blade in the sharpener. This is key to a long service life of the knife. The Wicked Edge allows you to maintain a razor edge while shaving off the\nleast amount of metal each time. Additionally, you are not limited by just a few blade angles as with other sharpeners, you have a wide range of 15 to\n30 degrees. I now maintain a log with all my knifes and the specific information for each knife to be placed in the exact location on the sharpener\neach and every time it is loaded. If any of this seems complicated, it is not, it is all intuitive. You will find yourself so pleased with the\nresults that you will be calling your friends to sharpen their knifes! Believe me, this is one fantastic sharpener! If you are serious about having\nthe sharpest edge possible on your knives then this is the sharpener you need to own! No more shipping your knifes back to the factory to get that\nrazor edge! As far as I am concerned, The Wicked Edge Team are the village wizards! I tip my hat to the designers of this sharpener, so simple, yet\nhighly functional and ultra effective! It is well made and sturdy, truly the last sharpening system I will ever have to or need to purchase. n\nnWhere can I buy some stock! I missed out on Microsoft so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to miss out on this! n nRick DeRoberto, New Hampshire\ntroyandelle\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nClay, Greetings, I met you at the Atlanta Buckarama when I was there working with my friends outfitter store here in Stockbridge(Atlanta Suburb). I\nwas walking through checking out everything when my son and I stopped at your booth where you gladly sharpened my small pocket knife. I was sort of in\na time crunch and promised to come back and see about purchasing a sharpening set from you. Unfortunately I got stuck back in our corner working on\nbows and was not able to get back over to you in time. I would like to see about purchasing one and taking it to the shop to show folks how\nincredible your product is. I have NEVER had a edge of that quality put on any knife of mine. I have already been asked how I got my knife that sharp\nand it would be a lot easier to show them instead of trying to explain it.

I have spent too many dollars to recount on sharpening tools over the years. This is the first product that creates a\nconsistent, razor-sharp edge on every knife I've set in the device. And it achieves results quickly. Wicked Edge has done its homework and designed a\ngreat tool that is not encumbered by the shortcomings of nearly every tool I've encountered. Great job Wicked Edge! Thanks for making a product that\nwarrants me spending my hard-earned dollars on.\nehill\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nThis is truly the greatest knife sharpener ever created. The design makes the best and longest lasting edge that I have ever seen. I have used several\ndifferent sharpeners with marginal success and marginal edges. Anyone can sharpen a razor edge on any knife in very little time. As a professional\nhunting guild I had to carry four or five knifes before the wicked edge knife sharpener came into my life, now I carry one and can do several elk at a\ntime without stopping to reshape the edge. I love it. I have even sharpened all of my kitchen knives as well. Now I look for any excuse to touch up my\nknives. The wicked edge knife sharpener makes sharpening a fun and quick job. I now enjoy sharpening knifes and demo the WEKS every chance I get.\np.fronteddu\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nDevin, nI went right home, put it together and got right down to sharpening.

I think you have hit the design/function vs price ncurve\nright at moa. nThe only suggestion I would offer is an upgrade to the glue you use to hold nthe stones in their trays....sharpening away, had a stone\nfall out. No nbiggie, no damage, just interrupted my meditation. A little Elmer's and I nwas back at it. If/when that fails, I'll upgrade my own glue.\nnThat is my first impression of a fine product....I'm off to Mom's to make nher kitchen drawer a dangerous place and change up the edge on my Silver\nnStag Damascus. nThanks for dreaming up this goofy thing that is an engineer's delight, works ngreat and is a work of art.

I have been using it now for all of three days and I already have the hang of it. I started on my knives to learn on then\nwent strait for my Wife's twin-man professional Henckels. Long story short, my wife is super pleased with how they turned out (translation: money well\nspent according to the Boss!). The quality of the sharpener is second to none and after each use I am more pleased with it. As I have used other\nclamp/vice type sharpening products in the past, I was a little bit concerned that the clamp might not hold the blade straight and in the same\nposition every time, but you guys nailed that one in spades- the WE clamp is so adjustable and versatile. I tried blades of varying thicknesses from\nless than 1/8th inch thick to around a quarter inch thick with varying taper angles. Your clamp held them perfectly and snugly with no room for error.\nI can't wait till you develop the chisel attachment. Thanks again, and God bless. nCapt Tom Brannan USMC\njim.stevenson\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nClay; I have received the remaining stones and Strops for my Wicked Edge.

The main problem is that in camp I am spending all my time sharpening everyone else's knives. Well\nit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy with Wicked edge and I enjoy watching My hunting partners face when the lick their arm and shave the hair off with ease. nThanks\nagain for the fool proof sharpener. nShaun M.

I purchased the WE this past weekend at the Colorado Springs Gun Show (April 6 09). I have read books on knife sharpening, I have\ndiamond, ceramic and Arkansas stones of all grades of grit, I have all kinds of steels and other sharpening devices. At best I can get a decent edge\nusing these but they don't compare or come close to the razor edge the WE gives. The fine ceramic stones were not in stock but I plan to purchase\nthose when they become available. I was given the leather strops as part of the purchase. I would consider those essential to a fine edge and assume\nthe fine ceramic stones will become essential once I have them. The WE is a flawlessly designed and high quality product, It deserves \"Invention of\nthe Year Award.\"\ntstoming\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nUnbelievable. I threw all my other sharpeners in the trash after sharpening my first knife with this. Up until now, with my considerable collection of\nfine knives, I have been careful \"using\" some of my better knives due to that fact that I could never get anything close to a factory edge back on the\nknife(I have always been somewhat challenged with sharpeing). Now, I can put a scalpel like edge on any knife.

Finally a system to fulfill my quest for the perfect edge. Years have been spent and many systems have been bought.\nYet perfection was never attained until now. Wicked edge has perfected a system to put a razor sharp edge on most of my knives. The key is its\ninherrent quality construction which allows the diamond stones to be applied at the precise angle on both sides of the blade. Furthermore, Wicked Edge\nhas eliminated user error with a system that insures consistancy by only a modicum of skill on behalf of the operator. I believe a certain amount of\nskill is necessary, in that the left hand needs to replicate the movement of the right (for a right handed person) however this can quickly be learned\nand is fun once the proper rythym is achieved. The one drawback with this system however would be its inability to sharpen serrated and concave\nblades. So I guess I'll have to keep my Spyderco Sharpmaker. Overall though I'm extremely happy with the Wicked Edge Sharpener, so much so that I\norder both the extra rough and fine stones to get an even sharper edge. Hey, that says it all in my opinion.\nhharris\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nWicked Edge Customer Service is superlative! All new, innovative products have glitches that get worked out with time. I had stripped one of the\nadjusting screws on my sharpener - twice! you graciously replaced the part once and I stripped that one too. I was pretty convinced I was doing\nsomething wrong since the device was otherwise excellent. I visited your booth at the Blade Show in Atlanta and mentioned the problem expecting to be\ntold that I was doing abusing the sharpener. Instead you opened up a new box and handed me upgraded replacement parts including new, improved rods!\nOutstanding! I know it costs you something to support your product at that level but I trust that success will result from that kind of amazing\ncommitment to your customers. I placed an order for ceramic stones and leather strops today - just my way of saying thanks and expressing my\nconfidence in a well-supported product. Keep up the good work!

My frustration was the ability to get the perfect edge and sharpness. At the NRA\nConvention in Phoenix I was very impressed with the Wicked Edge Sharpener I bought one on the spot and have ordered the additional accessories. After\nthey arrived, I got busy and I have to say that I am totally blown away at the quality and ease of putting that perfect edge on my knife. I took my\nfavorite knife that had a 25 degree edge and decided to change it to a 23 degree edge. At first I was ready to cry once I saw what the quick results\nof the coarse stone did (which is the way it was designed)but in very short order progressing through the finer stones I achieved that perfect edge\nand a mirror finish on the blade. I have nothing but positive things to say about this knife sharpener. The only thing that would make this better is\nto have an IPO and go public as I would buy your stock.\ninfo\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nVery nice sharpener, was able to put a razor sharp edge on every knife in my house the afternoon that I received it. The only drawbacks that I see at\nthis point are: 1) I'm unable to sharpen some of my smaller pocket knives (ie. Buck Deuce) because the top of the blade doesn't clear the top of the\nclamp enough. 2) haven't found a way to hold a few blades that are only sharpened on one side--the clamp holds the blade at an angle. In these two\ncases, I can't use it, but I hardly use those anyway, for the knives I actually use, this puts a very usable/repeatable edge on them quite quickly.\nrdkoontz\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nI am very happy with the Wicked Edge Sharpener, it is the best sharpener that I have. nI have tried many other sharpeners, the other two best\nsharpeners I used to use was the Lansky and Tormek both had flaws for me. The Lansky had issues of not holding on to the blade and it would move\naround and the bevel on both sides would not come out even. The Tormek which now sells for in the $500 neighborhood, would grind to high a bevel on\nthe tips of smaller knives. The Tormek messed up the bevel at the tip of a Chris Reeves small Sebenza knife I had to send it back to Chris to have it\nfixed. n I also want to mention the customer service of Wicked Edge is excellent even after I have purchased the system and had it for awhile, I sent\ne-mail requesting help and they have always answered my e-mails with helpful information. I would recommend this system to anyone who is looking for a\nreally good sharpener. I am a knife collector, and make knives, so I am always looking for the ultimate knife sharpening system. Being able to put a\nrazor sharp edge on a knife is very important to me.\njoe.cathey\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nFor years I have tried to freehand sharpen my knives without allot of success. So I began reading about the art of knife sharpening on the internet\nand suddenly realized there was an overload of information. Everyone had opinions about what was the best way to do the job. Since I have gotten to be\nan senior citizen and my hands are a little shakey I decided on getting some sort of sharpening guide and purchased a Lansky standard diamond system.\nImmediately realized that the principal was great, but there had to be a more user friendly device out there some where, Back to the internet I go and\nnarrow my choices to the Edge Pro Apex and the Wicked Edge system. About the time I was poised to make the purchase I happened upon a You Tube demo of\na highly dissatisfied Wicked Edge customer and was almost completely turned off to the Wicked Edge system. I called and talked to Clay Allison at\nWicked Edge and got his side of the story and decided to make the purchaseand I couldn't more pleased with the decision. The Wicked Edge system has\nmade a knife sharpener out of me and if it has done that for me it can do it for anyone. If you have been turned of by the You Tube slamming of the\nWicked Edge. Think about this, the guy has been offered his money back and still wants to keep the system. If it was as bad as he claims why would he\ndo that. I also find that the customer service and shipping is top notch at Wicked Edge. Put me down on the satisfied customer list and for sure I\nhave not been paid or coerced to make this statement.\njbaltzley\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nJoe, I purchased the wicked edge mainly to get my D2 steel hunting knives sharp...a task I had trouble with previously. I started with the vise, red,\nyellow, blue diamond files and a set of strops. The darn thing works so well, I bought a base and ceramics and well, I am out of stuff to buy.\nAnecdotally, I skinned and boned three deer without sharpening my two knives (caping and large hunting). Not until about halfway through the last deer\ndid I start noticing my knives getting dull. Just touching hair with them, caused it to pop away freely. Cutting the skin around the ankles was very\neasy to do and this is a task that can be a little difficult with a dull knife. I will have to adjust to using a knife this sharp. What a pleasure. So\nmany times I will purchase a product with hopes that it will work. So many times it doesn't work. I want you to tell your customers that this product\nWORKS. It will quickly make their knives scalpel sharp. Once sharpened, a knife can be retuned very quickly with minimal metal removal. I haven't\ntried the ceramics, but I would not be happy with the result without use of the strops after finishing with the purple stone. I haven't used smaller\nthan 10um media on mine and it only takes a few strokes to get the edge I desire. Todd\nebuckner\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nAwesome!! I have bought every possible sharpener on the market. Sharpmaker, Lansky deluxe diamond system, Apex edge pro. ect.... The Wicked edge hands\ndown beats them all. At least for me. I'm not a person with a lot of finesse when it comes to using my left hand. With this, the use of my non\ndominate hand is limited and controlled. Set up is way easy and the learning curve is excellent! The other sharpeners are fine products but the wicked\nedge is the one for me. Do yourself a favor and include the granite base.

I think I've owned every sharpening system out there,\nEdge Pro, Tormek, Lansky, etc; but none of them have really grasped the engineering concept that you have to maintain a consistant edge on both sides\nas you have. I know it is easy now to produce a quality edge on the average knife, so when I got mine the other day I decided to put it to the \"real\ntest\" of some of the type of knives I own, that heretofore, have been difficult to get a respectable edge on--consistently respectable edge. n nI\ndon't know if you are familiar with Talonite? A different steel that is not know for easy sharpening. The diamond stones (from anybody) will cut\nTalonite, but the precise engineering of the knife holder and the dual adjustable cutting degrees of your product is what will set you above the rest!\nI've sharpened my Talonite folder and developed a better edge than when it came new! Any BG42 grind will challenge a sharpening system, especially\nwhen the factory grind was offset in the first place! No sweat with the Wicked Edge! Finally, I had purchased a damascus folder that for the life of\nme I couldn't get a decent edge on. I gave up on it as an every day carry simply because I couldn't get it sharpened to what I thought it should be.\nOnce again no sweat with the Wicked Edge! n nOthers can comment on the price you charge but until they put this one in their shop, talk is cheap. I'm\na knife maker for over 20 years and always knew I could get a better edge on my hunting knives, but most was hit and miss. Now there is no miss! this\none is spot on target. Build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door! Your biggest problem will be keeping sufficient stock on\nhand. Congratulations! n nI've just ordered the last of the stones that you offer with this package and I am very happy with your product! Anyone who\nhas dealt with the myriad of sharpeners on the market can use yours and instantly see the time and added expense your team took to deliver a product\nthat will last.

I'm leaving for my fishing trip tomorrow but I just had to take a moment to write you. I tried the Wicked\nEdge on my lockblade and I can finally say for the FIRST time in my life that I have truly sharpened a knife. Shaving sharp is an understatement. When\nI tested the edge, the hair on my arm just fell away. My wife is laughing at me because I don't have any hair left on my arms to test with; think I'll\ntry shaving the dog next. I'm an avid outdoorsman and I have sharpened my fair share of knives. I've owned all kinds of sharpeners and have NEVER\nachieved an edge that even comes close to what I was able to do with the Wicked Edge. Operator error is virtually removed from the process; my 11-year\nold sharpened his small bait knife and produced the same 'wicked' result as me. He was upset with me because I insisted on dulling the edge before\ngiving it back to him. You have designed and built one fine piece of equipment, I couldn't be more satisfied.\nsincorvaia72159\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nThis review comes after over a year of use during which I have used my Wicked Edge Sharpener to set edge angles on 2 Swamp Rat Waki swords, 2 Busse\nNMSFNOs, 2 Busse SAQs, 1 Busse SAR5, plus 4 other Bussekins, and a number of custom made and production hard use knives, such as Strider and Landi,\nand 9x 154CM fighters. Setting an edge angle takes a great deal of work when you have uneven factory edges on HARD - hard use knives that vary. Each\nWaki took around 2 days of work to get to a 25 degrees shaving sharp even edge. Never in that time did the Wicked Edge not perform as advertised. Now\nit takes me less than 5 mins in total to maintain each of my blades, keeping them sharp and ready. The best part is that this outstanding performance\ncomes with a warranty that matches my knives, and with a level of customer service and support that is simply outstanding.\ninfo\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nMy sharpener arrived yesterday, and to say I was excited is an understatement. After years of inability on my part to get a truly sharp edge on my\nknives, that all changed after about 6 minutes of use with this rig. I put my prize Fallkniven PXL folder in the vise and closely followed Clay's\nexcellent instructions.The results were amazing...this blade made of very hard (Rockwell 62)laminated 3G powder steel came out hair-popping sharp\nafter the final lapping with the leather hones.It sliced paper and para cord with an aplomb that was truly satisfying. At last, a sharpener that does\neverything advertised and does it in spades. Awesome! The term scary sharp now has new meaning to me! nMy total experience with the Wicked Edge from\nstart to finish has been extremely positive. As if it isn't enough that the shapener itself is wonderful, the service rendered by Clay is excellent\nand way beyond what one has come to expect in this day and age.

What had I done wrong? I went back and analyzed my actions\nand I was shame-faced to find I had broken almost every instruction given by Clay. nFirst I over-tightened the top screw which led to the knife not\nholding its position it slipped after the first few strokes. Once I got that fixed, I went on not reading the instructions and did not raise a burr\nproperly...I didn't check with a cotton swab to see if the burr was there neither on the right nor the left side of the bevel. Then to top off my\ncarelessness, I had not set the angle adjusting screw tightly into the detente dimple at the 20 degree mark and so I was merrily stroking the blade\nwhile the right hand angled rod was moving freely at various positions. I couldn't have been more careless. nI went back and did the whole thing over\nagain and this time followed the instructions to the letter...a piece of cake and another smooth, slicing blade, especially after using the leather\nstrops and Diamond Paste. Excellent stuff. Thanks again Clay! Leo July 24 2010 Ontario, Canada\ninfo\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nClay, n Thanks so much. I finally got my sharpener from ordering it at the blade show. It's everything I thought it would be and more. I've been a\nLansky user for over 25 years. The Wicked Edge Sharpener is the ULTIMATE in knife sharpening. n I can't say enough about the versatility and adjust\nability of your (my) Sharpener. I was really excited to get the WEPS, but after using it the first day, I'm more impressed than I ever thought I would\nbe. The WEPS trues up every bevel and tip to perfection! Unbelievable! I new you had a great product when I saw it and talked to you at the Blade\nShow, but it has far exceeded all of my expectations. n Thanks Again, now I will make sure I have the rest of your accessories. Please make a travel\ncase to hold everything, as I need to take it everywhere I go.\nsnctool\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nI have a bag of quality knives, in particular sevaral hard steel Knives of Alaska and my vintage case hardened Buck Pathfinder, circa 1968. These old\nBucks were represented by the company with a logo showing a hammer punching them through bolts of steel (Buck abandoned the logo with the\nmodernization and softer steel). These hard Bucks can be sharpended but usually wore down poor stones, only hard Arkansas with hours of precision\nhoning would sharpen these. I am skilled and practiced at knife sharpening with the old Buck Hone Master and Arkansas stones. It takes a steady hand\nand constant angle. My knives were always razor sharp. Now they are sharper, all in one afternoon. nThis machine is incredible the impossible to\nsharpen Buck sharpened up in 15 minutes at 18 degrees with the extra stones and strops, The hair did not shave off me, it rolled and peeled off my\nhair shins as if it melted. Paper peeled off the blade with no resistance at all, no drag, not even the slightest. nI always wear two steel/kevlar\ngloves,even in the field this knife is sharper than surgical scapels right now. Never use a knive this sharp without protecting yourself against a\nslip. nWhen I clean fish it often enough is 50 or so 4-5#, It takes 5 or 6 different knives, each for a particular cut and job. nI am not the average\nknife user and appreciate the personal advice and tutoring and recommended stones and process, thank you, Clay. nThe world, in my view, has been\nwaiting 42 years for this device. $400 well spent, order #613.\ninsnekamkze86\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nGreat system, but extremely disspointed in the service of this company. After multiple promises to replace the angle bar that constantly slips, with a\nnew design, still nothing. I am sure it works as advertised, I just cant maintain an angle with in inferior product.\ndoug.granade\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nClay Allison has truly made the most effective knife sharpener on the market.

Suffice to say I now have the sharpest knife I have ever had; in ten\nminutes work; the very first try. If you cannot shave with your knife using the Wicked Edge sharpener, then do yourself a favor and throw all your\nknives away! The 10 micron paste left a mirror polish on the edge of the blade. Wow! Now I have to get back to work putting every blade in the kitchen\nback into working order. --Scott\nmeetskari\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nThe finest knife sharpening system I have ever owned, and I've wasted money on too many others. Mirrorlike edges in minutes. Never buy a razor again,\njust use your pocket knife!\njvshuford\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nI finally found time to write a quick review of the Wicked Edge (WE) sharpening system. First, I had an issue with notification and shipping, and I\nmust say that WE has some of the best customer support I have ever dealt with. They not only met my expectations in this area, but also exceeded them.\nTop notch company with regards to customer service. Second, they didn't have a base in stock when I originally ordered, so I made my own.\nUnfortunately, it wasn't perfect and I had an issue or two getting a really good edge on the knives I was trying to sharpen. Clay sent me another link\nor two with more information and perhaps another video to watch. I readjusted my mounting surface and tried again. The results are sensational. I'm a\nknife sharpening idiot. Plain & simple. nThis Wicked Edge system is revolutionary! Within 3 minutes, using just the 100/200, 400/600 stones, and both\nsets of strops, my pocket knife's edge is keen enough to shave arm smooth. And this is with a home made mount that isn't perfect. I recently ordered\nthe super fine ceramic stones and a real base to mount the system to. All I need now is for them to get the 800/1000 grit stones in stock, and I'm\nquite confident I'll be able to slice & dice my veggies like the pros, with a Wicked Edge of my own on all my knives. Thanks again for creating a\nproduct that is so simple to use, so precise, that I get a Wicked Edge every time. Sincerely, Roger Morris\njim\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nMy dad purchased this knife sharpening system for himself and for me to use (son). I am a cook and always have a knife in my hand. I can't explain how\nimportant a sharp knife is. We have all stones from 100 grit to the super fine ones. I have the sharpest knife you have ever seen or used. I'm\nactually sharpening the other cooks knives now. I can get a week of non stop use before having to resharpen and it only takes minutes! This system is\ngreat. I would say that if you are going to use it as much as I do, you need a better grade tightening bolts. The other ones strip easy. Overall, this\nis a great system and I plan on getting one for myself in the near future.\nmschroeder\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nI have always prided myself in my knives being sharp. I went to a store in Arizona and some guy offered to sharpen my knife, he swore by this system.\nSure enough that SOB had my knife sharper, and quicker then I could have done it using my free stones. I purchased one of these sharpening systems\nsoon after and I have not been let down this product is amazing. My only complaint is that my very small knives (pocket knives) I cannot use in this\nsystem without roughing the edges on the tip of this. But other than that this works amazing for my hunting knives and fillet blades. My buddies are\nin awe about how sharp my knives are at all times now... Thank you so much for making this product and striving to always improve it. I had a slight\ndelay in shipping back in June, but Wicked edge was more than polite and kept me up to date with my purchase. I will be doing more business with them.\nTop notch in customer service and one great product.\nmountain4\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nI have been a person who could never sharpen a knife and would leave it to the people who could.

Don Gustafson nOakland, CA\njameskampf\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nWell I just had to write and tell you how pleased I am. After spending literally thousands on every known sharpening method known to man the WICKED\nEDGE finally came through for me. In your video I saw a Dino-Lite Microscope so after a little research I ordered one to view the edge of my knifes.\nThe scope shows a perfect edge the full length of the blade. For the first time I can truly put a razor edge on my set of Global and Ikon knifes.\nAfter a little work I actually tried shaving with a small pocket knife after stropping and I was actually able to shave with it. I never write to\nanyone thanking them for a product but I find it impossible to not say thank you for this product. Respectfully, James M.

Now all my knives are razor\nsharp better then the factory edge that came on the knives. I have a lot of recurve blades (zt-300,Emerson commander etc) and I was worried about\nsharpening them with the regular stones but it worked great and now they all have mirror finishes. Im a member of USN forum and i told everyone about\nit that's how impressed I am with this sharpener and the customer service is awesome infact the best I have ever dealt with. Thank you WEPS\nggreenberg\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nThis sharpener is phenomenal. I was a die-hard SharpMaker user until I heard about this on the USN. After considering the Wicked Edge or the Edge Pro,\nI decided to go with the Wicked Edge and I am happy I did. It is extremely simple to use and it's much faster and more precise than anything else I've\nused to date. My knives are sharper than they have ever been and that's in half the time that it usually takes. The only reason I am giving this four\nstars instead of five is that the thumb screws seem to loosen sometimes. That is just as much user error as anything else because I need to be\nchecking the angle constantly, but I sometimes forget to and I will look down and see that the sharpening angle is about ten degrees different than\nwhat I started with. Overall, the best sharpening system out there. Really, nothing beats it.\nfaschn\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nIt seems highly suspicious that all the reviews have 5-stars. I see that reviews will require approval before they will be displayed. Why review them?\nAnd why not display bad reviews? Knowing what others truely think or what they were disappointed in might be helpful. For example, I know WEPS can't\ndo seraded edges (its sort of a no brainer) but if someone posted \"I was disappointed because it didn't do seraded edges.\" I'd know this product\nwasn't for me. I'm not saying that you should post all \"smack talk\" kinds of posts but posting only good, 5-star posts make you look aweful\nsuspicious! I'd like to hear why others might have been disappointed with what they purchased.\nfpandrieni\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nThis is without doubt the finest product of its type. Its biggest advantage is getting professional results without needing to have the type of skills\nthat stones demand. Knives are as sharp with this device as you will ever see. Well done\nbpwhitehair\u00a0\u00a0(Thursday, 26 May 2011)\nRating:\nThis is the without a doubt the best sharpener I have used or even seen. The results are great every time.
