It departs from classical mechanics primarily at the atomic and subatomic scales. In advanced topics of QM, some of these behaviors are macroscopic and only emerge at very low or very high energies or temperatures.\nThe name, coined by Max Planck, derives from the observation that some physical quantities can be changed only by discrete amounts, or quanta, as multiples of the Planck constant, rather than being capable of varying continuously or by any arbitrary amount. For example, the angular momentum, or more generally the action, of an electron bound into an atom or molecule is quantized. While an unbound electron does not exhibit quantized energy levels, an electron bound in an atomic orbital has quantized values of angular momentum. In the context of QM, the wave-particle duality of energy and matter and the uncertainty principle provide a unified view of the behavior of photons, electrons and other atomic-scale objects.\n(1 votes, average: 5.00 out of 5)\nLoading ...\nFor a generally accessible and less technical introduction to the topic, see Introduction to quantum mechanics.\nQuantum mechanics\nQuantum chaos \u00b7 Quantum field theory\nQuantum information science\nBell \u00b7 Bohm \u00b7 Bohr \u00b7 Born \u00b7 Bose\nde Broglie \u00b7 Dirac \u00b7 Ehrenfest\nt\ne\nQuantum mechanics (QM - also known as quantum physics, or quantum theory) is a branch of physics dealing with physical phenomena where the action is on the order of the Planck constant. Quantum mechanics departs from classical mechanics primarily at the quantum realm of atomic and subatomic length scales. QM provides a mathematical description of much of the dual particle-like and wave-like behavior and interactions of energy and matter.\nIn advanced topics of quantum mechanics, some of these behaviors are macroscopic and only emerge at extreme (i.e., very low or very high) energies or temperatures. The name quantum mechanics derives from the observation that some physical quantities can change only in discrete amounts (Latin quanta), and not in a continuous (cf. analog) way. For example, the angular momentum of an electron bound to an atom or molecule is quantized.[1] In the context of quantum mechanics, the wave\u2013particle duality of energy and matter and the uncertainty principle provide a unified view of the behavior of photons, electrons, and other atomic-scale objects.\nThe mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are abstract. A mathematical function called the wavefunction provides information about the probability amplitude of position, momentum, and other physical properties of a particle. Mathematical manipulations of the wavefunction usually involve the bra-ket notation, which requires an understanding of complex numbers and linear functionals. The wavefunction treats the object as a quantum harmonic oscillator, and the mathematics is akin to that describing acoustic resonance. Many of the results of quantum mechanics are not easily visualized in terms of classical mechanics - for instance, the ground state in a quantum mechanical model is a non-zero energy state that is the lowest permitted energy state of a system, as opposed a more \"traditional\" system that is thought of as simply being at rest, with zero kinetic energy. Instead of a traditional static, unchanging zero state, quantum mechanics allows for far more dynamic, chaotic possibilities, according to John Wheeler.\nThe earliest versions of quantum mechanics were formulated in the first decade of the 20th century. At around the same time, the atomic theory and the corpuscular theory of light (as updated by Einstein) first came to be widely accepted as scientific fact; these latter theories can be viewed as quantum theories of matter and electromagnetic radiation, respectively. Early quantum theory was significantly reformulated in the mid-1920s by Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Wolfgang Pauli and their collaborators, and the Copenhagen interpretation of Niels Bohr became widely accepted. By 1930, quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by the work of Paul Dirac and John von Neumann, with a greater emphasis placed on measurement in quantum mechanics, the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality, and philosophical speculation about the role of the observer. Quantum mechanics has since branched out into almost every aspect of 20th century physics and other disciplines, such as quantum chemistry, quantum electronics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. Much 19th century physics has been re-evaluated as the \"classical limit\" of quantum mechanics, and its more advanced developments in terms of quantum field theory, string theory, and speculative quantum gravity theories.\nContents\n3 Mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics\n4 Interactions with other scientific theories\n4.1 Quantum mechanics and classical physics\n4.2 Relativity and quantum mechanics\n4.3 Attempts at a unified field theory\n5 Philosophical implications\n7.4 Particle in a box\n7.5 Finite potential well\nHistory\nMain article: History of quantum mechanics\nThe history of quantum mechanics dates back to the 1838 discovery of cathode rays by Michael Faraday. This was followed by the 1859 statement of the black body radiation problem by Gustav Kirchhoff, the 1877 suggestion by Ludwig Boltzmann that the energy states of a physical system can be discrete, and the 1900 quantum hypothesis of Max Planck.[2] Planck's hypothesis that energy is radiated and absorbed in discrete \"quanta\" (or \"energy elements\") precisely matched the observed patterns of blackbody radiation. According to Planck, each energy element E is proportional to its frequency \u03bd:\nwhere h is Planck's constant. Planck (cautiously) insisted that this was simply an aspect of the processes of absorption and emission of radiation and had nothing to do with the physical reality of the radiation itself.[3] However, in 1905 Albert Einstein interpreted Planck's quantum hypothesis realistically and used it to explain the photoelectric effect, in which shining light on certain materials can eject electrons from the material.\nThe 1927 Solvay Conference in Brussels.\nThe foundations of quantum mechanics were established during the first half of the 20th century by Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, Louis de Broglie, Albert Einstein, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Max Born, John von Neumann, Paul Dirac, Wolfgang Pauli, David Hilbert, and others. In the mid-1920s, developments in quantum mechanics led to its becoming the standard formulation for atomic physics. In the summer of 1925, Bohr and Heisenberg published results that closed the \"Old Quantum Theory\". Out of deference to their particle-like behavior in certain processes and measurements, light quanta came to be called photons (1926). From Einstein's simple postulation was born a flurry of debating, theorizing, and testing. Thus the entire field of quantum physics emerged, leading to its wider acceptance at the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927.\nThe other exemplar that led to quantum mechanics was the study of electromagnetic waves, such as visible light. When it was found in 1900 by Max Planck that the energy of waves could be described as consisting of small packets or \"quanta\", Albert Einstein further developed this idea to show that an electromagnetic wave such as light could be described as a particle (later called the photon) with a discrete quantum of energy that was dependent on its frequency.[4] This led to a theory of unity between subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves, called wave\u2013particle duality, in which particles and waves were neither one nor the other, but had certain properties of both.\nWhile quantum mechanics traditionally described the world of the very small, it is also needed to explain certain recently investigated macroscopic systems such as superconductors and superfluids.\nThe word quantum derives from the Latin, meaning \"how great\" or \"how much\".[5] In quantum mechanics, it refers to a discrete unit that quantum theory assigns to certain physical quantities, such as the energy of an atom at rest (see Figure 1). The discovery that particles are discrete packets of energy with wave-like properties led to the branch of physics dealing with atomic and sub-atomic systems which is today called quantum mechanics. It is the underlying mathematical framework of many fields of physics and chemistry, including condensed matter physics, solid-state physics, atomic physics, molecular physics, computational physics, computational chemistry, quantum chemistry, particle physics, nuclear chemistry, and nuclear physics.[6] Some fundamental aspects of the theory are still actively studied[7]\nQuantum mechanics is essential to understanding the behavior of systems at atomic length scales and smaller. For example, if classical mechanics truly governed the workings of an atom, electrons would rapidly travel toward, and collide with, the nucleus, making stable atoms impossible. However, in the natural world electrons normally remain in an uncertain, non-deterministic, \"smeared\", probabilistic wave\u2013particle wavefunction orbital path around (or through) the nucleus, defying classical electromagnetism.[8]\nQuantum mechanics was initially developed to provide a better explanation of the atom, especially the differences in the spectra of light emitted by different isotopes of the same element. The quantum theory of the atom was developed as an explanation for the electron remaining in its orbit, which could not be explained by Newton's laws of motion and Maxwell's laws of (classical) electromagnetism.\nBroadly speaking, quantum mechanics incorporates four classes of phenomena for which classical physics cannot account:\nThe quantization of certain physical properties\nWave\u2013particle duality\nMain article: Mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics\nSee also: Quantum logic\nIn the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics developed by Paul Dirac[9] and John von Neumann,[10] the possible states of a quantum mechanical system are represented by unit vectors (called \"state vectors\"). Formally, these reside in a complex separable Hilbert space - variously called the \"state space\" or the \"associated Hilbert space\" of the system - that is well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the projective space of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system - for example, the state space for position and momentum states is the space of square-integrable functions, while the state space for the spin of a single proton is just the product of two complex planes. Each observable is represented by a maximally Hermitian (precisely: by a self-adjoint) linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. If the operator's spectrum is discrete, the observable can only attain those discrete eigenvalues.\nIn the formalism of quantum mechanics, the state of a system at a given time is described by a complex wave function, also referred to as state vector in a complex vector space.[11] This abstract mathematical object allows for the calculation of probabilities of outcomes of concrete experiments. For example, it allows one to compute the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus at a particular time. Contrary to classical mechanics, one can never make simultaneous predictions of conjugate variables, such as position and momentum, with accuracy. For instance, electrons may be considered (to a certain probability) to be located somewhere within a given region of space, but with their exact positions unknown. Contours of constant probability, often referred to as \"clouds\", may be drawn around the nucleus of an atom to conceptualize where the electron might be located with the most probability. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle quantifies the inability to precisely locate the particle given its conjugate momentum.[12]\nAccording to one interpretation, as the result of a measurement the wave function containing the probability information for a system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator representing the observable\u00a0\u2014 which explains the choice of Hermitian operators, for which all the eigenvalues are real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is represented by the statement that the operators corresponding to certain observables do not commute.\nThe probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement. This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand. It was the central topic in the famous Bohr-Einstein debates, in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of thought experiments. In the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a \"measurement\" has been extensively studied. Newer interpretations of quantum mechanics have been formulated that do away with the concept of \"wavefunction collapse\" (see, for example, the relative state interpretation). The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wavefunctions become entangled, so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity. For details, see the article on measurement in quantum mechanics.[13]\nGenerally, quantum mechanics does not assign definite values. Instead, it makes a prediction using a probability distribution; that is, it describes the probability of obtaining the possible outcomes from measuring an observable. Often these results are skewed by many causes, such as dense probability clouds. Probability clouds are approximate, but better than the Bohr model, whereby electron location is given by a probability function, the wave function eigenvalue, such that the probability is the squared modulus of the complex amplitude, or quantum state nuclear attraction.[14][15] Naturally, these probabilities will depend on the quantum state at the \"instant\" of the measurement. Hence, uncertainty is involved in the value. There are, however, certain states that are associated with a definite value of a particular observable. These are known as eigenstates of the observable (\"eigen\" can be translated from German as meaning \"inherent\" or \"characteristic\").[16]\nIn the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of everything (every observable) as being in an eigenstate. Everything appears to have a definite position, a definite momentum, a definite energy, and a definite time of occurrence. However, quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values of a particle's position and momentum (since they are conjugate pairs) or its energy and time (since they too are conjugate pairs); rather, it only provides a range of probabilities of where that particle might be given its momentum and momentum probability. Therefore, it is helpful to use different words to describe states having uncertain values and states having definite values (eigenstates). Usually, a system will not be in an eigenstate of the observable (particle) we are interested in. However, if one measures the observable, the wavefunction will instantaneously be an eigenstate (or \"generalized\" eigenstate) of that observable. This process is known as wavefunction collapse, a controversial and much-debated process[17] that involves expanding the system under study to include the measurement device. If one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement, one will be able to compute the probability of the wavefunction collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates. For example, the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wavefunction that is a wave packet centered around some mean position x0 (neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum). When one measures the position of the particle, it is impossible to predict with certainty the result.[13] It is probable, but not certain, that it will be near x0, where the amplitude of the wave function is large. After the measurement is performed, having obtained some result x, the wave function collapses into a position eigenstate centered at x.[18]\nThe time evolution of a quantum state is described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, in which the Hamiltonian (the operator corresponding to the total energy of the system) generates the time evolution. The time evolution of wave functions is deterministic in the sense that - given a wavefunction at an initial time - it makes a definite prediction of what the wavefunction will be at any later time.[19]\nDuring a measurement, on the other hand, the change of the initial wavefunction into another, later wavefunction is not deterministic, it is unpredictable (i.e. random). A time-evolution simulation can be seen here.[20][21]\nWave functions change as time progresses. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes how wavefunctions change in time, playing a role similar to Newton's second law in classical mechanics. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation, applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle, predicts that the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity (like a classical particle with no forces acting on it). However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more uncertain with time. This also has the effect of turning a position eigenstate (which can be thought of as an infinitely sharp wave packet) into a broadened wave packet that no longer represents a (definite, certain) position eigenstate.[22]\nFig. 1: Probability densities corresponding to the wavefunctions of an electron in a hydrogen atom possessing definite energy levels (increasing from the top of the image to the bottom: n = 1, 2, 3, ...) and angular momenta (increasing across from left to right: s, p, d, ...). Brighter areas correspond to higher probability density in a position measurement. Wavefunctions like these are directly comparable to Chladni's figures of acoustic modes of vibration in classical physics, and are indeed modes of oscillation as well, possessing a sharp energy and, thus, a definite frequency. The angular momentum and energy are quantized, and take only discrete values like those shown (as is the case for resonant frequencies in acoustics)\nSome wave functions produce probability distributions that are constant, or independent of time - such as when in a stationary state of constant energy, time vanishes in the absolute square of the wave function. Many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such \"static\" wave functions. For example, a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus, whereas in quantum mechanics it is described by a static, spherically symmetric wavefunction surrounding the nucleus (Fig. 1) (note, however, that only the lowest angular momentum states, labeled s, are spherically symmetric).[23]\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation acts on the entire probability amplitude, not merely its absolute value. Whereas the absolute value of the probability amplitude encodes information about probabilities, its phase encodes information about the interference between quantum states. This gives rise to the \"wave-like\" behavior of quantum states. As it turns out, analytic solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation are only available for a very small number of relatively simple model Hamiltonians, of which the quantum harmonic oscillator, the particle in a box, the hydrogen molecular ion, and the hydrogen atom are the most important representatives. Even the helium atom - which contains just one more electron than does the hydrogen atom - has defied all attempts at a fully analytic treatment.\nThere exist several techniques for generating approximate solutions, however. In the important method known as perturbation theory, one uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to generate a result for a more complicated model that is related to the simpler model by (for one example) the addition of a weak potential energy. Another method is the \"semi-classical equation of motion\" approach, which applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces only weak (small) deviations from classical behavior. These deviations can then be computed based on the classical motion. This approach is particularly important in the field of quantum chaos.\nMathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics\nThere are numerous mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics. One of the oldest and most commonly used formulations is the \"transformation theory\" proposed by the late Cambridge theoretical physicist Paul Dirac, which unifies and generalizes the two earliest formulations of quantum mechanics - matrix mechanics (invented by Werner Heisenberg)[24] and wave mechanics (invented by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger).[25]\nEspecially since Werner Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932 for the creation of quantum mechanics, the role of Max Born in the development of QM has become somewhat confused and overlooked. A 2005 biography of Born details his role as the creator of the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. This fact was recognized in a paper that Heisenberg himself published in 1940 honoring Max Planck.[26] and In the matrix formulation, the instantaneous state of a quantum system encodes the probabilities of its measurable properties, or \"observables\". Examples of observables include energy, position, momentum, and angular momentum. Observables can be either continuous (e.g., the position of a particle) or discrete (e.g., the energy of an electron bound to a hydrogen atom).[27] An alternative formulation of quantum mechanics is Feynman's path integral formulation, in which a quantum-mechanical amplitude is considered as a sum over all possible histories between the initial and final states. This is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the action principle in classical mechanics.\nInteractions with other scientific theories\nThe rules of quantum mechanics are fundamental. They assert that the state space of a system is a Hilbert space, and that observables of that system are Hermitian operators acting on that space - although they do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators. These can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system. An important guide for making these choices is the correspondence principle, which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical mechanics when a system moves to higher energies or - equivalently - larger quantum numbers, i.e. whereas a single particle exhibits a degree of randomness, in systems incorporating millions of particles averaging takes over and, at the high energy limit, the statistical probability of random behaviour approaches zero. In other words, classical mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large systems. This \"high energy\" limit is known as the classical or correspondence limit. One can even start from an established classical model of a particular system, then attempt to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit.\nUnsolved problems in physics\nIn the correspondence limit of quantum mechanics: Is there a preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics? How does the quantum description of reality, which includes elements such as the \"superposition of states\" and \"wavefunction collapse\", give rise to the reality we perceive?\nWhen quantum mechanics was originally formulated, it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was non-relativistic classical mechanics. For instance, the well-known model of the quantum harmonic oscillator uses an explicitly non-relativistic expression for the kinetic energy of the oscillator, and is thus a quantum version of the classical harmonic oscillator.\nEarly attempts to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved the replacement of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a covariant equation such as the Klein-Gordon equation or the Dirac equation. While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles. A fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of quantum field theory, which applies quantization to a field (rather than a fixed set of particles). The first complete quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics, provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction. The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems. A simpler approach, one that has been employed since the inception of quantum mechanics, is to treat charged particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical electromagnetic field. For example, the elementary quantum model of the hydrogen atom describes the electric field of the hydrogen atom using a classical\nCoulomb potential. This \"semi-classical\" approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role, such as in the emission of photonss by charged particles.\nQuantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons. The weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak theory), by the physicists Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg. These three men shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for this work.[28]\nIt has proven difficult to construct quantum models of gravity, the remaining fundamental force. Semi-classical approximations are workable, and have led to predictions such as Hawking radiation. However, the formulation of a complete theory of quantum gravity is hindered by apparent incompatibilities between general relativity (the most accurate theory of gravity currently known) and some of the fundamental assumptions of quantum theory. The resolution of these incompatibilities is an area of active research, and theories such as string theory are among the possible candidates for a future theory of quantum gravity.\nClassical mechanics has also been extended into the complex domain, with complex classical mechanics exhibiting behaviors similar to quantum mechanics.[29]\nQuantum mechanics and classical physics\nPredictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy. According to the correspondence principle between classical and quantum mechanics, all objects obey the laws of quantum mechanics, and classical mechanics is just an approximation for large systems of objects (or a statistical quantum mechanics of a large collection of particles). The laws of classical mechanics thus follow from the laws of quantum mechanics as a statistical average at the limit of large systems or large quantum numbers.[30] However, chaotic systems do not have good quantum numbers, and quantum chaos studies the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions in these systems.\nQuantum coherence is an essential difference between classical and quantum theories, and is illustrated by the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. Quantum interference involves adding together probability amplitudes, whereas classical \"waves\" infer that there is an adding together of intensities. For microscopic bodies, the extension of the system is much smaller than the coherence length, which gives rise to long-range entanglement and other nonlocal phenomena that are characteristic of quantum systems.[31] Quantum coherence is not typically evident at macroscopic scales - although an exception to this rule can occur at extremely low temperatures (i.e. approaching absolute zero), when quantum behavior can manifest itself on more macroscopic scales (see macroscopic quantum phenomena, Bose-Einstein condensate, and Quantum machine). This is in accordance with the following observations:\nMany macroscopic properties of a classical system are a direct consequence of the quantum behavior of its parts. For example, the stability of bulk matter (which consists of atoms and molecules which would quickly collapse under electric forces alone), the rigidity of solids, and the mechanical, thermal, chemical, optical and magnetic properties of matter are all results of the interaction of electric charges under the rules of quantum mechanics.[32]\nWhile the seemingly \"exotic\" behavior of matter posited by quantum mechanics and relativity theory become more apparent when dealing with particles of extremely small size or velocities approaching the speed of light, the laws of classical Newtonian physics remain accurate in predicting the behavior of the vast majority of \"large\" objects (on the order of the size of large molecules or bigger) at velocities much smaller than the velocity of light.[33]\nRelativity and quantum mechanics\nMain articles: Quantum gravity and Theory of everything\nEven with the defining postulates of both Einstein's theory of general relativity and quantum theory being indisputably supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence and while they do not directly contradict each other theoretically (at least with regard to their primary claims), they have proven extremely difficult to being incorporated within one consistent, cohesive model.[34]\nEinstein himself is well known for rejecting some of the claims of quantum mechanics. While clearly contributing to the field, he did not accept many of the more \"philosophical consequences and interpretations\" of quantum mechanics, such as the lack of deterministic causality. He is famously quoted as saying, in response to this aspect, \"My God does not play with dice\". He also had difficulty with the assertion that a single subatomic particle can occupy numerous areas of space at one time. However, he was also the first to notice some of the apparently exotic consequences of entanglement, and used them to formulate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox in the hope of showing that quantum mechanics had unacceptable implications. This was 1935, but in 1964 it was shown by John Bell (see Bell inequality) that - although Einstein was correct in identifying seemingly paradoxical implications of quantum mechanical nonlocality - these implications could be experimentally tested. Alain Aspect's initial experiments in 1982, and many subsequent experiments since, have definitively verified quantum entanglement.\nAccording to the paper of J. Bell and the Copenhagen interpretation - the common interpretation of quantum mechanics by physicists since 1927 - and contrary to Einstein's ideas, quantum mechanics was not, at the same time:\na \"realistic\" theory\nand\na local theory.\nThe Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox shows in any case that there exist experiments by which one can measure the state of one particle and instantaneously change the state of its entangled partner - although the two particles can be an arbitrary distance apart. However, this effect does not violate causality, since no transfer of information happens. Quantum entanglement forms the basis of quantum cryptography, which is used in high-security commercial applications in banking and government.\nGravity is negligible in many areas of particle physics, so that unification between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not an urgent issue in those particular applications. However, the lack of a correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in cosmology and the search by physicists for an elegant \"Theory of Everything\" (TOE). Consequently, resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th and 21st century physics. Many prominent physicists, including Stephen Hawking, have labored for many years in the attempt to discover a theory underlying everything. This TOE would combine not only the different models of subatomic physics, but also derive the four fundamental forces of nature - the strong force, electromagnetism, the weak force, and gravity - from a single force or phenomenon. While Stephen Hawking was initially a believer in the Theory of Everything, after considering G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem, he has concluded that one is not obtainable, and has stated so publicly in his lecture \"G\u00f6del and the End of Physics\" (2002).[35] One of the leading authorities continuing the search for a coherent TOE is Edward Witten, a theoretical physicist who formulated the groundbreaking M-theory, which is an attempt at describing the supersymmetrical based string theory. M-theory posits that our apparent 4-dimensional spacetime is, in reality, actually an 11-dimensional spacetime containing 10 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension, although 7 of the spatial dimensions are - at lower energies - completely \"compactified\" (or infinitely curved) and not readily amenable to measurement or probing.\nAttempts at a unified field theory\nMain article: Grand unified theory\nThe quest to unify the fundamental forces through quantum mechanics is still ongoing. Quantum electrodynamics (or \"quantum electromagnetism\"), which is currently (in the perturbative regime at least) the most accurately tested physical theory,[36][unreliable source](blog) has been successfully merged with the weak nuclear force into the electroweak force and work is currently being done to merge the electroweak and strong force into the electrostrong force. Current predictions state that at around 1014 GeV the three aforementioned forces are fused into a single unified field,[37] Beyond this \"grand unification,\" it is speculated that it may be possible to merge gravity with the other three gauge symmetries, expected to occur at roughly 1019 GeV. However\u00a0\u2014 and while special relativity is parsimoniously incorporated into quantum electrodynamics\u00a0\u2014 the expanded general relativity, currently the best theory describing the gravitation force, has not been fully incorporated into quantum theory.\nPhilosophical implications\nMain article: Interpretations of quantum mechanics\nSince its inception, the many counter-intuitive aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debates and many interpretations. Even fundamental issues, such as Max Born's basic rules concerning probability amplitudes and probability distributions took decades to be appreciated by society and many leading scientists. Indeed, the renown physicist Richard Feynman once said, \"I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.\"[38]\nThe Copenhagen interpretation - due largely to the Danish theoretical physicist Niels Bohr - remains the quantum mechanical formalism that is currently most widely accepted amongst physicists, some 75 years after its enunciation. According to this interpretation, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but instead must be considered a final renunciation of the classical idea of \"causality\". It is also believed therein that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the complementarity nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations.\nAlbert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, disliked this loss of determinism in measurement. Einstein held that there should be a local hidden variable theory underlying quantum mechanics and, consequently, that the present theory was incomplete. He produced a series of objections to the theory, the most famous of which has become known as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. John Bell showed that this \"EPR\" paradox led to experimentally testable differences between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories. Experiments have been performed confirming the accuracy of quantum mechanics, thereby demonstrating that the physical world cannot be described by any local realistic theory.[39] The Bohr-Einstein debates provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an epistemological point of view.\nThe Everett many-worlds interpretation, formulated in 1956, holds that all the possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes.[40] This is not accomplished by introducing some \"new axiom\" to quantum mechanics, but on the contrary, by removing the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet. All of the possible consistent states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus (including the observer) are present in a real physical - not just formally mathematical, as in other interpretations - quantum superposition. Such a superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an entangled state. While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we can observe only the universe (i.e., the consistent state contribution to the aforementioned superposition) that we, as observers, inhabit. Everett's interpretation is perfectly consistent with John Bell's experiments and makes them intuitively understandable. However, according to the theory of quantum decoherence, these \"parallel universes\" will never be accessible to us. The inaccessibility can be understood as follows: once a measurement is done, the measured system becomes entangled with both the physicist who measured it and a huge number of other particles, some of which are photons flying away at the speed of light towards the other end of the universe. In order to prove that the wave function did not collapse, one would have to bring all these particles back and measure them again, together with the system that was originally measured. Not only is this completely impractical, but even if one could theoretically do this, it would destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place (to include the physicist's memory).[citation needed]\nApplications\nQuantum mechanics had enormous[41] success in explaining many of the features of our world. The individual behaviors of the subatomic particles that make up all forms of matter (elections, protons, neutrons, photons, and others) can often only be satisfactorily described using quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics has strongly influenced string theories, candidates for a Theory of Everything (see reductionism), and the multiverse hypotheses.\nQuantum mechanics is also critically important for understanding how individual atoms combine covalently to form molecules. The application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is known as quantum chemistry. Relativistic quantum mechanics can, in principle, mathematically describe most of chemistry. Quantum mechanics can also provide quantitative insight into ionic and covalent bonding processes by explicitly showing which molecules are energetically favorable to which others, and the magnitudes of the energies involved.[42] Furthermore, most of the calculations performed in modern computational chemistry rely on quantum mechanics.[43]\nA working mechanism of a resonant tunneling diode device, based on the phenomenon of quantum tunneling through potential barriers\nA great deal of modern technological inventions operate at a scale where quantum effects are significant. Examples include the laser, the transistor (and thus the microchip), the electron microscope, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study of semiconductors led to the invention of the diode and the transistor, which are indispensable parts of modern electronics systems and devices.\nResearchers are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating quantum states. Efforts are being made to more fully develop quantum cryptography, which will theoretically allow guaranteed secure transmission of information. A more distant goal is the development of quantum computers, which are expected to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical computers. Another active research topic is quantum teleportation, which deals with techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances.\nQuantum tunneling is vital to the operation of many devices - even in the simple light switch, as otherwise the electrons in the electric current could not penetrate the potential barrier made up of a layer of oxide. Flash memory chips found in USB drives use quantum tunneling to erase their memory cells.\nWhile quantum mechanics primarily applies to the atomic regimes of matter and energy, some systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects on a large scale - superfluidity, the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near absolute zero, is one well-known example. Quantum theory also provides accurate descriptions for many previously unexplained phenomena, such as black body radiation and the stability of the orbitals of electrons in atoms. It has also given insight into the workings of many different biological systems, including smell receptors and protein structures.[44] Recent work on photosynthesis has provided evidence that quantum correlations play an essential role in this basic fundamental process of the plant kingdom.[45] Even so, classical physics can often provide good approximations to results otherwise obtained by quantum physics, typically in circumstances with large numbers of particles or large quantum numbers.\nExamples\nFree particle\nFor example, consider a free particle. In quantum mechanics, there is wave-particle duality, so the properties of the particle can be described as the properties of a wave. Therefore, its quantum state can be represented as a wave of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a wave function. The position and momentum of the particle are observables. The Uncertainty Principle states that both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be measured with complete precision simultaneously. However, one can measure the position (alone) of a moving free particle, creating an eigenstate of position with a wavefunction that is very large (a Dirac delta) at a particular position x, and zero everywhere else. If one performs a position measurement on such a wavefunction, the resultant x will be obtained with 100% probability (i.e., with full certainty, or complete precision). This is called an eigenstate of position - or, stated in mathematical terms, a generalized position eigenstate (eigendistribution). If the particle is in an eigenstate of position, then its momentum is completely unknown. On the other hand, if the particle is in an eigenstate of momentum, then its position is completely unknown.[46] In an eigenstate of momentum having a plane wave form, it can be shown that the wavelength is equal to h/p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the eigenstate.[47]\n3D confined electron wave functions for each eigenstate in a Quantum Dot. Here, rectangular and triangular-shaped quantum dots are shown. Energy states in rectangular dots are more \u2018s-type\u2019 and \u2018p-type\u2019. However, in a triangular dot, the wave functions are mixed due to confinement symmetry.\nStep potential\nMain article: Solution of Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a step potential\nScattering at a finite potential step of height V 0, shown in green. The amplitudes and direction of left- and right-moving waves are indicated. Yellow is the incident wave, blue are reflected and transmitted waves, red does not occur. E > V 0 for this figure.\nThe potential in this case is given by:\nThe solutions are superpositions of left- and right-moving waves:\n,\nwhere the wave vectors are related to the energy via\n, and\nand the coefficients A and B are determined from the boundary conditions and by imposing a continuous derivative on the solution.\nEach term of the solution can be interpreted as an incident, reflected, or transmitted component of the wave, allowing the calculation of transmission and reflection coefficients. In contrast to classical mechanics, incident particles with energies higher than the size of the potential step are still partially reflected.\nRectangular potential barrier\nMain article: Rectangular potential barrier\nThis is a model for the quantum tunneling effect, which has important applications to modern devices such as flash memory and the scanning tunneling microscope.\nParticle in a box\n1-dimensional potential energy box (or infinite potential well)\nMain article: Particle in a box\nThe particle in a one-dimensional potential energy box is the most simple example where restraints lead to the quantization of energy levels. The box is defined as having zero potential energy everywhere inside a certain region, and infinite potential energy everywhere outside' that region. For the one-dimensional case in the\ndirection, the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written as:[48]\nWriting the differential operator\nthe previous equation can be seen to be evocative of the classic kinetic energy analogue\nwith\nas the energy for the state\n, whioch in this case coincides with the kinetic energy of the particle.\nThe general solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the particle in a box are:\nor, from Euler's formula,\nThe presence of the walls of the box determines the values of C, D, and k. At each wall (x = 0 and x = L), \u03c8 = 0. Thus when x = 0,\nand so D = 0. When x = L,\nC cannot be zero, since this would conflict with the Born interpretation. Therefore, sin kL = 0, and so it must be that kL is an integer multiple of \u03c0. And additionally,\nThe quantization of energy levels follows from this constraint on k, since\nFinite potential well\nMain article: Finite potential well\nThis is generalization of the infinite potential well problem to potential wells of finite depth.\nHarmonic oscillator\nMain article: Quantum harmonic oscillator\nSome trajectories of a harmonic oscillator (i.e. a ball attached to a spring) in classical mechanics (A-B) and quantum mechanics (C-H). In quantum mechanics, the position of the ball is represented by a wave (called the wavefunction), with the real part shown in blue and the imaginary part shown in red. Some of the trajectories (such as C,D,E,and F) are standing waves (or \"stationary states\"). Each standing-wave frequency is proportional to a possible energy level of the oscillator. This \"energy quantization\" does not occur in classical physics, where the oscillator can have any energy.\nAs in the classical case, the potential for the quantum harmonic oscillator is given by:\nThis problem can be solved either by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation directly, which is not trivial, or by using the more elegant \"ladder method\", first proposed by Paul Dirac. The eigenstates are given by:\nwhere Hn are the Hermite polynomials:\nand the corresponding energy levels are\n.\nThis is another example which illustrates the quantization of energy for bound states.\nNotes\n^ The angular momentum of an unbound electron, in contrast, is not quantized.\n^ J.

Quantum mechanics is required to analyze the behavior of molecules, atoms, and nuclei.\nBlackbody radiation\nA blackbody is an ideal thermal object that absorbs all radiation falling on it at low temperatures and is also a perfect radiator. The curves of radiation intensity versus wavelength could not be explained by classical physics. Max Planck (1858\u20131947) developed an equation for blackbody radiation that agreed with the data. This derivation required two assumptions:\nThe vibrating molecules emitting the radiation could have only certain discrete amounts of energy, given by E n = nhf, where n is called a quantum number, F is the frequency, and h is Planck's constant given by h = 6.626 \u00d7 10\u221234 joule-seconds.\nMolecules emit energy in units called quanta, now called photons. They do this by jumping from one energy state to another. The energy of the light quanta emitted by the jump between energy states is given by E = hf, or in terms of wavelength,\nThe radical nature of Planck's vision is the assumption of quantized energy states. The terms discrete and quantum referred to considering the energy as coming in packets instead of as a continuous flow; thus, the molecule will change energy states only if the amount of energy absorbed or radiated is a discrete amount of energy.\nPhotoelectric effect\nThe photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons from certain metals when light shines on the metallic surface. The emitted electrons are called photoelectrons. A number of aspects of the effect were puzzling:\nFor a given metal, the light has to be of at least a minimum frequency, called the cutoff frequency or the threshold frequency.\nThe kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is not dependent upon the intensity of the light causing the photoelectric effect.\nThe maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons increases with increasing light frequency.\nElectrons are emitted almost immediately from the surface; that is, no build-up of energy flowing into the molecules is necessary. Figure 1 shows a sketch of the maximum kinetic energy versus the frequency of light incident upon the metal.\nFigure 1\nThe photoelectric effect.\nEinstein explained the photoelectric effect, using Planck's quantum hypothesis and the conservation of energy. His equation is K.E. max = hf \u2212 Q, where Q is called the work function. The work function is the energy required to release the electron from a particular metal. The energy of the incoming photons, or quanta, is hf; therefore, the photoelectric equation simply states that the energy of the ejected electrons is the difference between the energy absorbed from the quanta of light and the energy required to escape from the material.\nThe unexplained observations described above can be illuminated by the following arguments.\nA certain threshold frequency of the incident light is necessary to provide a quanta of sufficient energy to eject an electron.\nAs the intensity of the incident light increases, so will the number of emitted electrons, but their kinetic energies will not increase.\nAs the frequency increases, so does the energy of the photons so that the ejected electrons will have greater kinetic energy.\nA low-light intensity indicates few quanta, but if those are of sufficient energy, some electrons will be emitted immediately.\nCompton scattering\nAdditional evidence for the quantized nature of electromagnetic waves came from the Compton effect, named for Arthur Compton (1892\u20131962). Compton scattering involves the scattering of a high-energy, e-ray photon and an electron. The scattered photon has less energy than the original photon, which can be seen as a change in wavelength. Compton explained this by assuming that the photon behaves like a particle when interacting with the electron. The conservation of momentum and energy used for elastic collisions of billiard balls could mathematically explain the experimental observations. The scattering effect is dependent upon the angle but not the wavelength. The small shift in wavelength would be too difficult to detect with less energetic photons, such as light photons.\nParticle-wave duality\nThe photoelectric effect and the Compton effect again point to the duality of the nature of electromagnetic radiation. The models of light as a wave and also as a particle complement each other. When the photons of electromagnetic radiation are of relatively high energy, the wavelengths are short. Then the photon acts more like a particle than a wave. For example, the Compton photons were high-energy x-rays. When the photons of electromagnetic radiation have relatively low energy, the wavelengths are long. Radio waves are an example of less energetic photons that act more like waves than particles.\nDe Broglie waves\nLouis de Broglie (1892\u20131987) postulated that because photons have both wave and particle characteristics, perhaps particles also have wave characteristics. From the energy of the photon,\nthe momentum of a photon can be derived:\nDe Broglie hypothesized that material particles with momentum p should have a wave nature and a corresponding wavelength given by his equation:\nNote that the de Broglie wavelength is directly proportional to h, which is a constant to the \u201334 power. With the relatively large masses and velocities of ordinary life, the de Broglie wavelengths are so small that they are virtually undetectable.\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg (1901\u20131976), states that it is impossible to simultaneously measure a particle's position and velocity exactly. Specifically, the uncertainty in the measurements are given by\nAnother form of the expression refers to the uncertainty in measurements of energy and time\nIn principle, it is possible to make exact measurements in classical physics; however, even in principle making exact measurements is not possible in quantum mechanics. Consider finding the exact position of a charged particle that produces a spot of light when hitting a phosphor. The exact position is known, but information about the particle's momentum has changed. Or consider viewing an object under a microscope. In order to see the object, some photons must reflect off it to the eye of a viewer. These incident photons will cause uncertainties in the measurement. In other words, the very act of the measurement procedure in quantum mechanics introduces uncertainty into the data collected.\n"}, {"score": 3222.0015, "uuid": "eee5a31e-82ca-5f65-9fbe-26093d5d24b0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1205wb-01-11484", "target_hostname": "www.new-science-theory.com", "target_uri": "http://www.new-science-theory.com/string-theory.php", "page_rank": 1.2550604e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "String Theory, <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em> <em>and</em> <em>physics</em> today.", "snippet": "<em>The</em> observed behaviour of gravity <em>is</em> certainly very similar to that of <em>the</em> other forces, but does any <em>physics</em> fully explain <em>the</em> similarities <em>and</em> <em>the</em> <em>differences</em> ?!", "explanation": null, "document": "----\n----\nEnglish ----> Espa\u00f1ol ---- Deutsch ---- Fran\u00e7ais ---- Italiano ---- Portugu\u00eas ...

So characteristic of this new apex of modern arrogance is the inability to comprehend the obvious in physics: That we don't know what we are talking about.\nLast December ('05), physicists held the 23rd Solvay Conference in Brussels, Belgium. Amongst the many topics covered in the conference was the subject matter of string theory. This theory combines the apparently irreconcilable domains of quantum physics and relativity. David Gross a Nobel Laureate made some startling statements about the state of physics including: \"We don't know what we are talking about\" whilst referring to string theory as well as \"The state of physics today is like it was when we were mystified by radioactivity.\"\nThe Nobel Laureate is a heavyweight in this field having earned a prize for work on the strong nuclear force and he indicated that what is happening today is very similar to what happened at the 1911 Solvay meeting. Back then, radioactivity had recently been discovered and mass energy conservation was under assault because of its discovery. Quantum theory would be needed to solve these problems. Gross further commented that in 1911 \"They were missing something absolutely fundamental,\" as well as \"we are missing perhaps something as profound as they were back then.\"\nComing from a scientist with establishment credentials this is a damning statement about the state of current theoretical models and most notably string theory. This theoretical model is a means by which physicists replace the more commonly known particles of particle physics with one-dimensional objects which are known as strings. These bizarre objects were first detected in 1968 through the insight and work of Gabriele Veneziano who was trying to comprehend the strong nuclear force.\nWhilst meditating on the strong nuclear force Veneziano detected a similarity between the Euler Beta Function, named for the famed mathematician Leonhard Euler, and the strong force. Applying the aforementioned Beta Function to the strong force he was able to validate a direct correlation between the two. Interestingly enough, no one knew why Euler's Beta worked so well in mapping the strong nuclear force data. A proposed solution to this dilemma would follow a few years later.\nAlmost two years later (1970), the scientists Nambu, Nielsen and Susskind provided a mathematical description which described the physical phenomena of why Euler's Beta served as a graphical outline for the strong nuclear force. By modelling the strong nuclear forces as one dimensional strings they were able to show why it all seemed to work so well. However, several troubling inconsistencies were immediately seen on the horizon. The new theory had attached to it many implications that were in direct violation of empirical analyses. In other words, routine experimentation did not back up the new theory.\nNeedless to say, physicists romantic fascination with string theory ended almost as fast as it had begun only to be resuscitated a few years later by another 'discovery.'

Unfortunately, the graviton has never ever been detected; it is as previously indicated a 'mythical' particle that fills the mind of the theorist with dreams of golden Nobel Prizes and perhaps his or her name on the periodic table of elements.\nBut back to the historical record. In 1974, the scientists Schwarz, Scherk and Yoneya reexamined strings so that the textures or patterns of strings and their associated vibrational properties were connected to the aforementioned 'graviton.' As a result of these investigations was born what is now called 'bosonic string theory' which is the 'in vogue' version of this theory. Having both open and closed strings as well as many new important problems which gave rise to unforeseen instabilities.\nThese problematical instabilities leading to many new difficulties which render the previous thinking as confused as we were when we started this discussion. Of course this all started from undetectable gravitons which arise from other theories equally untenable and inexplicable and so on.

However, what they could not anticipate is that the theory that they hoped would produce a theory of everything would leave them more confused and frustrated than they were before they departed from particle physics.\nThe end result of string theory is that we know less and less and are becoming more and more confused. Of course, the argument could be made that further investigations will yield more relevant data whereby we will tweak the model to an eventual perfecting of our understanding of it.

In this paper, I suggest how the mind and brain might fit together intimately while still maintaining distinct identities. The connection is based on the correspondence of similar functions in both the mind and the quantum-mechanical brain.\nThe Mind-Brain Problem\nThe problem of the relation between mind and body is well known as a difficult 'world knot'. Over the centuries various monistic and dualistic theories have been proposed, and the subject has had renewed interest as we try to assimilate the implications of quantum physics. These implications may make us reexamine our views of brains and bodies, but it is still not clear what consequences they have for our understanding of minds.\nEarlier in the interpretation of quantum mechanics, it appeared that the problem of measurement could only be solved by introducing some basic notion of an observer, presumably a conscious observer. Many scientists and philosophers (e.g. Wigner (1962) Eccles and Popper (1977), Faber (1986), Toben (1974), Squires (1990), Donald (1990) among others) have taken this solution to indicate an essential role of consciousness in the physical world. Consciousness, to solve the measurement problem, must initiate the transition from quantum potentialities to definite actualities. It would not have to select which actuality, but merely cause some actuality to be produced. Squires and Donald accept this merely 'collapse prompting' role of consciousness, and their position has the advantage of requiring no changes to quantum theory, as consciousness then makes no change to any predicted probability. Squire's conclusion, unfortunately, does not yield any functional role which may be important in mental and/or physiological processes in the brain. Donald (1990) does go on to give circumstances in which 'measurement collapses' are important for the function of neural cells, but their effects are simply to reinstate the 'classical' on/off nature of the sodium switches even when there are quantum uncertainties.\nSince, moreover, it is possible that the 'measurement problem' can be solved within physics (see e.g. Maxwell, 1988), the role of consciousness in measurement has little direct bearing on the problem of how the mind and brain function together. In order to say something relevant to the brain sciences, we have to go beyond conventional quantum mechanics (of whatever interpretation), and make new hypotheses with definite empirical content. We have to postulate that 'consciousness' (whatever that may turn out to be) influences the actual outcome of neural events, and does not just observe them as if disinterestedly.\nQuantum Brains\nIt is well known that there is a residual indeterminism of quantum mechanics in making predictions of physical processes. Quantum mechanics is also 'non-local', as described for example by Bell's inequalities. If either of these two phenomena are displayed in the brain as described by quantum physics, then this may be relevant to the problem of consciousness.\nBiased Probabilities:\nOne proposal (from Walker (1970) and later Eccles (1977)) has been that mental events influence at least some physical outcomes within the range allowed by quantum mechanics. This idea has to supplemented by an account of how these small effects are amplified to affect macroscopic outcomes, and recently possible accounts have been presented, Eccles (1989). Eccles requires that the options of a single vesicle discharging or not discharging both have non-zero quantum probabilities, so that such neural events are genuinely under-determined by quantum mechanics, and the way is open for them to be determined by the mind.\nBose-Einstein Condensates:\nAnother proposal by Marshall (1989) is that the mental and bodily realms derive directly from a quantum realm, as separate appearances of an underlying structure given by quantum mechanics. Since the unity of mental experience is one of its outstanding features, the proposal is that consciousness arises from a quantum mechanical structure which shows remarkably unity, namely Bose-Einstein condensates. This therefore requires not only that the brain amplifies quantum indeterminism, but also that long-range and long-time correlations of quantum phases are set up in the brain, by means for example of a structure proposed by Fr\u00f6hlich.\nBoth these proposals go some way toward connecting the apparently disparate realms of mind and brain. From the physics side, both have quantum mechanics holding virtually unchanged. They furthermore then both require that neuro-physiological processes are in some essential way 'quantum processes'. They require then that the peculiarly quantum features of matter become much more spatially spread out in the brain than is usually admitted. In the language of physics, Marshall requires that non-local correlations (of the kind described by Bell's Inequalities) are set up between parts of the brain that are very far apart on the atomic scale, and hence that the brain exhibits some of the characteristics of 'quantum computers' as described by Deutsch (1985). There is a difficulty that this implies much larger quantum effects than have ever been observed in materials at room temperature. There is evidence of unusual microwave absorption, but it is not clear whether this really demonstrates quantum correlations as distinct from sets of coupled classical (non-quantum) oscillations.\nEccles' proposal is weaker than Marshall's, as he only requires that for some brief time the non-local correlations extend between the options of a single vesicle discharging or not discharging, so there can exist a coherent superposition of these two states. Eccles does not require that the two options remain coherent for any duration after the event (as Marshall would require to obtain widespread and persisting quantum phase coherences).\nBoth proposals are made less likely by the fact that Plank's constant, which sets the scale for quantum processes, is so small. It is not impossible that there are genuinely undetermined neural events in the brain, and/or that there are large scale quantum coherent effects, but these are difficult to set up in the noisy room-temperature non-crystalline system of the brain. Psychological ConsiderationsThere are also questions from the psychological point of view. Eccles' proposal tells us very little about the structure of the mind, apart from the fact that it must be able to predict and control the amazingly complicated system of many of the random discharges in the brain. There is little indication from what psychologists know about the mind that it has anything like the required analytical and motor capacities. The mind is best dealing with at most 5 to 8 items, and is completely swamped when it tries to understand massively parallel systems directly. A way of avoiding these difficulties will be discussed below .\nMarshall's proposal seems to tell us more about the mind, namely that it arises whenever quantum mechanics gives suitable Bose-Einstein condensates. However, all psychological details of mental structure and operations would then be derived from this quantum structure. That is, he would have to claim that all human life (from mathematics and logic to arts to psychopathology) is implicit in Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. Personally, I find it extremely implausible that the quantum mechanics of patterns of excitations of Bose-Einstein condensates exactly and mechanically determines the interaction patterns of ideas, images and meanings in the human mind. There are certainly similarities between the two, but these do not imply identity. To talk of similarity without giving evidence for identity leads to another approach, as we see next.\nA Different Approach\nDespite the apparently smallness of quantum effects in the brain, I still believe that quantum physics is important in our understanding of its function. To show this, I am going to take a different approach. I am going to assume, in a non-reductionist way, as Eccles and others do, that the mind is (in some way) distinct from the brain. But I want to then see how they could be intimately connected again. Psychologists and psychiatrists are aware of the close functional dependence of minds and brains, so that physiological changes very readily affect the mind in many ways, and mental intentions and attitudes affect both the normal and abnormal functioning of the nervous system.\nI am going to take a 'top-down' to the problem of interaction, and will suggest how it may usefully be organised, from the functional point of view. I am not going to assume that quantum mechanics must be unchanged; I am therefore going to follow the 'spirit' if not the 'letter' of quantum physics. The aim is to motivate a plausible general view which will make predictions about what goes on. Afterwards I will discuss the origins of this general view.\nThe guiding principle I use is that the mind and brain are similar in structure and function, and that they need each other to operate. They are not identical, but are similar in the sense of 'resonating' or 'corresponding' to each other from the functional point of view. In order to see how the mind and brain are similar and fit together in this general way, we do need to remember quantum physics.\nSimilarity of Minds and (Quantum) Brains\nI am here going to draw analogies between mental and quantum phenomena. If you already know something about minds, these may help you understand quantum physics! Some of these have been pointed out by Bohm (1951, \u00a7 8.27ff) and more recently by Jahn & Dunne (1986) and Zohar (1990) (although perhaps understood in different ways: see later discussion).\nJahn and Zohar have tended to concentrate on the analogies between mental structures, and the structure of matter entailed by quantum mechanics. They look at analogies between, for example, minds and quantum systems, and then especially analogies between how minds interact and how quantum systems interact. I will be looking rather at analogies between individual mental processes within minds and individual quantum processes. I believe that only when we understand the elementary processes of both the mind and quantum matter, can we more completely understand complex systems of either kind.\nIn order to make analogies with quantum physics, I am going to assume something like the 'propensity interpretation' of Maxwell (1988) and others (Thompson, 1988). I am also going to assume a view of mind that is in part phenomenological (after Bergson especially), and in part influenced by (a few of) the aims of artificial intelligence (AI) and the recognition of the complexity of even apparently elementary mental processes. On this basis, we can draw analogies between the fundamental processes of quantum physics and the fundamental processes of mental activity:\nQuantum objects do not evolve uniformly in time, but as a succession of 'states' between intermittently 'actualising' to one outcome of a certain range.\nMental entities do not evolve uniformly in time, but in a succession of 'specious presents' between intermittent changes of state.\nThe state of a quantum object is not a static configuration of elements, but a 'state of propensity' for possible virtual proceses, possible interactions and possible actual (observable) outcomes.\nThe state of a mind is not static, but more a 'state of propensity': it is a continual recollection of past events and continual anticipation of future possibilities.\nThe state of a quantum object may be described by a wave function distributed is space, but this does not mean that the quantum object is composed of elements so distributed. Rather, it has a basic unity in that it will always act as a whole. These spatial distributions merely describe where it can actualise.\nThe state of a mind has a similar basic unity. The thoughts in the mind may be diverse, and each may implicitly contain diverse elements (usually the better for doing so), but if they lead to action these diverse elements were merely describing where the mind could have operated.\nThe driving impetus of quantum processes are not external, but the very propensities of which quantum objects are forms. These propensities operate according to the (spatiotemporal) circumstantial relations with other objects.\nThe driving motivation of mental processes are not external, but the very motivational loves which underly all psychic activities. These motivations operate according to the circumstances at each time.\nBehind the apparently continuous evolution of the Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, there is a progressive multitude of 'virtual events' whose operation forms the potential term in Schr\u00f6dinger's equation.\nAs a consequence of simulation efforts in AI, we know that the operation of even seemingly simple events such as the perception of solid objects must involve 'behind the scenes' a great deal of information processing which is not apparent in the act of perception itself.\nIn view of these analogies, and also those given later , it unlikely that the mental and physical processes are independent, and merely interact with each other at certain 'mental-neural' events (Eccles, 1989). We could hold that they both derive from a 'quantum realm', but I hold to a more radical (but simpler) idea that the propensities for physical processes derive from mental processes, which in turn always act according to past physical events. This idea, explained further in the next section, means that the mental and physical realms are far from separable, but are intimately related in a very systematic manner. Thus, although the basic idea may not be exactly fashionable these days, it is an idea with significant predictive power and good empirical content. Nevertheless, as explained later, it has a long and venerable history, and deserves closer consideration.\nHow Minds and (Quantum) Brains Fit Together\nIn order for people to have functioning minds, their minds must at least be able to\nimplement intended functions using the motor areas,\nestablish permanent memories, presumably by means of permanent physiological changes,\nform perceptions using information from the visual & auditory (etc.) cortexes,\nbe able to follow 'internal' trains of thought/feeling/imagining without necessarily having any external effects.\nOne way that these requirements can be most simply accomplished is by means of the idea above, formulated in the following three principles:\nI.\nThat the mind predisposes the physical/physiological potentialities (both deterministic or indeterministic according to quantum physics).\nII.\nThat the 'predispositional' capacities of the mind are consequentially restricted (and hence conditioned) by their actual effect.\nIII.\nThat the pattern of I and II is repeated for individual stages of more complex processes.\nThese principles together give what can be called 'conditional forward causation', or 'top-down causation'. Note that we do not have a fourth 'bottom-up' principle that neural events directly cause events to occur in the mind. We do not have general matter $\\rightarrow$ mind causation, although something resembling this does arise, namely 'selection'. This is not causation in the primary sense of 'principal causation' as 'producing or generating the effect'. It is more in the secondary sense of 'instrumental causation' as 'providing a necessary prerequisite'.\nA strong argument for these three principles is that they are already similar to what is known already to happen in quantum physics, in quantum field theory to be precise. According to that theory, there is a class of events called 'virtual events' which select and predispose the ordinary quantum wave function. These virtual events operate deterministically, and describe the operation of the electric, magnetic, nuclear and gravitational forces. They are not the 'final' actual events of quantum mechanics (those are the definite outcomes of events like observations). Rather, they are a 'prior level' of 'implicit events' whose operation is needed in order to produce the potentialities for events like observations. The principle (I) states the analogical result that mental events themselves are a 'prior level' of 'implicit events' whose operation is needed in order to produce the potentialities for physical events.\nThe argument for the principle (II) is more general. Whenever any potentiality is exercised to produce a particular outcome, future potentialities must depend on the detailed outcome. Suppose for example that at the moment, I have the potentialities of moving left or right; if I actually move left, say, then this influences (by restriction to a fixed history) of what I can do from now on. This second principle can also be seen as a 'law of karma': your future life is restricted and influenced by your past actions (by selection). Physical events are in this way the necessary foundations for permanent mental history and structure.\nPrinciple (III) has an important corollary\nIIIb.\nThat the mind predisposes the brain to carry out those functions which 'mirror' or 'correspond to' the mind's own functions.\nThis is because mental functions involve intermediate steps, and these intermediate mental steps predispose suitable intermediate physical steps (by I), and are in turn conditioned or confirmed by them (by II). Thus the sequence of physical steps will follow the sequence of mental steps, and the overall function of the physical process will be analogous (in some sense) to the overall function of the mental process. Examples of this 'mirroring' or 'corresponding' have already been illustrated by the similarities between minds and brains listed in the previous section. Examples of correspondences of complex processes in the mind with those of physics will be given below .\nLet us then see how these principles enable the mind and brain to function together:\nThe particular functions selected by the mind to be carried out by the brain will be the establishment of spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity that may then be 'decoded' in the motor cortex to lead to the desired activities, by the principle (I). Principle (IIIb) establishes a criterion for the overall functioning of this decoding.\nPermanent physiological changes lead to permanent memories in the mind, by the principle (II). (It is an empirical question, which physiological changes are relevant, but principle (IIIb) will be a guide.)\nPerceptions are formed by the sensory cortex areas deterministically forming particular patterns of neural activity, so that these physiological effects can select the subsequent perceptual content of the mind. The process here is rather subtle. The mind must have a 'general disposition' to see/imagine any of its possible percepts; the role of the sensory cortex is to select the particular content, by means of principle (II). Thus we have the general psychological observation that 'we see only what we are capable of and disposed to see'.\nTo be able to follow 'internal' trains of thought/feeling/imagining without necessarily having any external effects, the mind must be able to produce physiological effects which do not have any significant consequences. Presumably, much of the cerebral cortex can function in a 'loosely connected' way, in order to provide the foundation for a set of permanent mental structures.\nMind and Brain as 'Hand and Glove'\nThis theory of mind and brain connection establishes in intimate relation between them. It is not a relation of identity, or a relation of aspects or points of view. It is more a relation of inner and outer, or cause and effect: propensities in the brain are the causal product of mental actions. As put in by Bawden (1947), 'the role of the psychical in relation to the physical (in the living organism) is essentially the relation of the potential or incipient to kinetic or overt action'.\nThe mind and brain fit together by approximate analogy with hand and glove, or, better, with tissue and skin. The analogy (by principle IIIb) is most precisely with the functions of tissue & skin, and not so much with their material shape. The mind provides all the directed activity of the brain, just as the tissue of the hand provides all the directed activity of the skin of the hand. When we look at the head, we only see the brain, just as we only see skin when we look at the hand. It appears that the skin of the hand does all the work, but we don't assume that that is all there is. It appears that the skin has life, but we know that all but the simplest life comes from the underlying tissue. The skin (as does the brain) has simple capacities for action and reactions, but it is a mistake to imagine that all capacities for activity and information processing belong to the skin (or the brain).\nPsychology\nOnce we have the basic idea of functional correspondences between physical and mental systems based on their causal interrelations, then we have a fertile source for exploring the detailed structure of one using what we know about the other.\nPsychology of Stages\nBecause there are 'prior' and 'post' levels of events even within physics, by the correspondence principle IIIb, there must also be prior and post levels of events within the mind. Piaget's theory of stages of development is relevant here.

Mensky (World Scientific Publishing Company) The phenomenon of consciousness includes mysterious aspects providing a basis for many spiritual doctrines (including religions) and psychological practices. These directions of human knowledge are usually considered to contradict the laws of science. However, quantum mechanics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in a sense, the mysterious direction of science \u00e2\u0080\u0094 allows us to include the phenomena of consciousness and life as well as the relevant phenomena in the sphere of science.\nWolfgang Pauli, one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics, together with great psychologist Carl GustavJung, guessed about the relation between quantum mechanics and consciousness in the beginning of the twentieth century. However, only \"many-worlds\" interpretation of quantum mechanics, proposed in 1957 by Hugh Everett Ill, gave the real basis for the systematic investigation of this relation.\nRoger Penrose, one of the apologists of the relation between quantum mechanics and consciousness, claimed in his Last book \"The Road to Reality\" that the Everett's interpretation may be estimated only after creating the theory of consciousness. There against, the author has proposed in 2000 and further elaborates in this book, the so-called Extended Everett's Concept, that allows one to derive the main features of consciousness and super-consciousness (intuition, or direct vision of truth) from quantum mechanics. This is exposed in this book in a form intelligible for a wide audience.\nThe phenomenon of consciousness demonstrates mystical features that are experienced by some people. All religions and spiritual schools that exist for thousands of years include the mystical component as a necessary part of their message and make use of mystical features of consciousness in their practice.\nNowadays the interest to these phenomena is widespread. It is natural in this situation that actually becomes the question whether the mystical features of consciousness are compatible with science. It turns out that the compatibility is justified if the specific features of quantum mechanics are taken into account.\nThese special features of quantum mechanics are known as \"quantum reality\", i.e. the different concept of reality accepted in quantum mechanics as compared with classical physics. The most adequate expression of the concept of quantum reality is the so-called \"Many-Worlds\" interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed by Everett in 1957. According to this version of quantum mechanics, our world is quantum, and its state is adequately presented by the set of many classical worlds (alternative classical realities), that are equally real (coexist) while existing of only one reality is nothing else than illustion of our consciousness.\nJust this picture of our (quantum) world as the set of parallel (classical) worlds is the key point. The commonly accepted assumption is that the only real (existing) world is that which is subjectively perceived by our consciousness. All considerations become radically different if, instead of this, one accept is that all possible classical states of our world (all alternative realities) parallely exist. This concept allows one to understand what is consciousness and to explain why it possesses mystical features.\nThis book is a review of the author's research on the conceptual structure of quantum mechanics and its connection with the phenomena of\nconsciousness and life. The main ideas are expressed in the book in the simple terms such as parallel worlds (presenting the alternative realities), so that the book is targeted at a wide audience. Those chapters of the book that require special knowledge are notified as written for professional physicists. These chapters may be skipped without detriment for understanding the main line of consideration. Moreover, these chapters may also be skipped by physicists in the first reading of the book.\n\"A Law of Minimization of Mystery: consciousness is mysterious and quantum mechanics is mysterious, so maybe the two mysteries have a common source.\"\nDavid Chalmers\nThe specific quantum approach to the phenomenon of cousciousness (in-ding its mystical abilities) is called Quantum Concept of Consciousness CC). More general considerations concerning the phenomenon of life are toted by the term Quantum Concept of Life (QCL). Nevertheless, when exposing these subjects for physicists with elements of mathematical formalism, we prefer to use the term Extending Everett's Concept (EEC) in ler to underline that the whole approach appeared as a generalization of known interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed by Everett.\nThe interrelations of the three terms may be presented by the following scheme:\nQCC C QCL = EEC\nMost of the material presented in the book is available for people having special knowledge. Some chapters are oriented on professional physicists, t we tried to make this clear from the titles and introductory words of\nchapters. These chapters may be skipped (even by physicists) without triment for understanding the main points of the theory.\nBecause of the attempt to make the book available and interesting both for professional physicists and general audience, some considerations are posed repeatedly. In these cases the style of presentation, its level and\ncontext are different in different parts of the book, so that the repetition should make understanding of difficult ideas easier.\nThe present Foreword briefly explains the specific features of the author's approach for the readers-physicists. Those who are not professional physicists may skip the Foreword and go over to Introduction.\nThis book is about connection between quantum mechanics at one side and the phenomena of consciousness and life at the other side. Assumption about the connection of such different objects as quantum mechanics and consciousness, seems strange and for many people even impossible. Yet it has been discussed from the very moment of creation of quantum mechanics and became very popular in the last decades.\nMost of those who in our time discuss the connection of consciousness with quantum mechanics, look for some quantum effects in the brain that could play a role in the phenomenon of consciousness. For example they may consider the hypotheses that some material structures in the brain operate in fact as a quantum computer. Such an approach is explicitly or implicitly based on the conviction that consciousness is a product of the brain. But is it? What do we know about the nature of consciousness? The thorough analysis shows that we know nothing at all about this important issue.\nThe idea underlying the author's approach is to make no a priori assumption about the nature of consciousness, but rather to describe functions of consciousness in terms which are characteristic of quantum theory (deriving this description from the logical analysis of the concept of \"quantum reality\") and only after this, a posteriori, to judge about the nature of consciousness.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nThe question about the nature and characteristic features of consciousness became important nowadays. The issue of consciousness has been attacked from various directions, but without great success in the important aspects of this issue. The most evident way to clarify the nature of consciousness is investigating the brain that seems to be the origin of consciousness. However, just now, when the instruments for the investigation of the brain became very efficient, it is becoming more and more clear that this direction of research cannot discover the actual nature of consciousness.\nUnexpectedly for many people, the problem of consciousness has been attacked from the viewpoint of quantum mechanics and was connected with the conceptual problems of the quantum mechanics itself. In the course of the research it became clear that this direction is not at all novel. It was initiated as early as in the first quarter of the 20th century by the founding fathers of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrodinger, Wolfgang Pauli and others. However, these genius thinkers had no adequate instruments in their disposal.\nSuch instruments appeared later in the works of Albert Einstein (Einsten\u00e2\u0080\u0094Podolsky\u00e2\u0080\u0094Rosen paradox), John Bell (Bell's theorem), and especially Hough Everett (Everett's, or \"Many-Worlds\" interpretation of quantum mechanics).\nThe proposal of Everett is especially important because it supplies an adequate language for the strange concept of quantum reality, counterintuitive and yet proved to be valid in our world. After Everett, one may say that actual (quantum) reality may be expressed in terms of many coexisting (parallel) classical worlds. This essentially simple (although not very easy for accepting it because of the classical prejudice) presentation of quantum reality allows one to naturally include it in the consideration.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nMost attempts to give quantum explanation for consciousness reduce to looking for the material structures in the brain that could work in quantum coherent regime. This is difficult (and probably impossible) to do because quantum coherence is rapidly destroyed by the process of the inevitable decoherence.\nThe approach proposed by the present author and supported in the present book radically differs from this. We do not make any definite assumption about the nature of consciousness beforehand, particularly we do not assume that consciousness is produced by the brain. Instead we start with the analysis of the logical structure of quantum mechanics and make use of the fact that the concept of \"consciousness of an observer\" necessarily arises in quantum mechanics (in the analysis of the concept of quantum reality) and is adequately formulated in the Everett's \"Many-Worlds\" interpretation of quantum mechanics. Then, on the basis of this logical structure, we make an additional assumption that allows us to formulate the phenomenon of consciousness in terms of the concepts typical for quantum mechanics and simultaneously simplifies the logical structure of quantum mechanics itself.\nOnly after this the question of the nature of consciousness may be posed and resolved. It turns out that the brain does not produce consciousness but is rather an instrument of consciousness. Important processes (first of all super-intuition), that are starting and finishing in consciousness, are performed nevertheless in the unconscious state.Quantum coherency is achieved in these processes because they deal with the quantum reality, i.e. with the whole quantum world. The obstacle of decoherence does not appear in this case because the quantum world as a whole has no environment that could cause decoherence.\nTherefore, starting from functions rather than material carriers of functions turns out the only efficient approach. One of the astonishing conclusions is that some functions have no concrete material carriers or, alternatively, have the whole world as their carrier. This leads in fact to the unification of the sphere of material with the spiritual sphere.\nThe idea that this approach may be fruitful appeared during the preparation of the review at the famous Ginzburg's seminar in Moscow. The aim of the review was the novel applications of quantum mechanics called quantum information. However, this issue is closely connected with the foundations of quantum mechanics. In the process of work on this topic it unexpectedly occurred to me that the main features of consciousness including its mystical abilities are explained if a simple logical construction is added to conventional quantum mechanics. Especially exciting was that this additional assumption actually simplified the logical structure of quantum mechanics.\nThis was astonishing and led to further investigations that revealed the deep interconnection between the concept of quantum mechanics and the phenomena characteristic for life. It turned out that mysterious character of life explains those features of quantum mechanics that are counter-intuitive and vice versa. The most deep theory of inanimate matter expressed in the form of quantum mechanics supplies just those notions and abilities that are necessary for understanding of the (otherwise mysterious) phenomena of consciousness and life.\nThe central role in this internal connection is the so-called \"quantum reality\" . This counter-intuitive concept was investigated in various ways beginning from the famous Einstein\u00e2\u0080\u0094Podolsky\u00e2\u0080\u0094Rosen paradox and ending by Everett's interpretation.\nThe Everett's picture of actually quantum world as the set of many coexisting parallel worlds (alternative classical realities) expresses the concept of quantum reality in the most transparent way. If one thinks about consciousness, keeping in mind that actual reality is not a single classical world but many equally real (although subjectively seeming to be alternative, excluding each other) classical worlds (as alive and dead Scr\u00f6dinger cat), he/she understands what is consciousness including its mystical features (super-intuition, or direct vision of truth, and even how one may \"manage reality\" ).\nThis conclusion appeared unexpectedly, but actually it has been prepared by the long history of insights of genius physicists into the internal sense of quantum mechanics. It seems that now we are also close to the better understanding of what is quantum mechanics. It is exciting that this new level of understanding is directly connected with the phenomena of life and consciousness.\nPhysicists do not usually recognize that the character of their work may depend on their philosophical position. The majority of physicists looks at the philosophy condescendingly, considering it not as science but the skill of the manipulation by words. However, the interrelation of physics and philosophy become significant for physicists and are actively discussed at the key moments of the development of physics.\nTwo aspects of these interrelations are then important. First, physicists discover that their specific philosophical views (or at least the methodological principles accepted by them) nevertheless influence their work (first of all this concerns the methods of interpreting experimental results. Second, the qualitatively new achievements of physics change the philosophical position occupied by most of physicists. These processes are tightly connected with a change in the methodology, which turns out to be necessary in connection with the new achievements. All this together is the passage to a new paradigm in the science.\nThe period of creating quantum mechanics (the first third of 20th century), which coincided with the period of creating special and general theory of relativity, was such critical epoch in physics. These enormous developments in physics, especially quantum mechanics, overturned the world view of physicists, particularly forcing them to abandon too limited understanding of materialism.\nApparently, physics experiences now a similar period of an active change in the paradigm, and particularly in philosophy of physics. The change is necessary because of realizing the close connection of quantum theory with the phenomenon of consciousness.\n11.4.1 Wigner\nIn the seminal paper [Wigner (1961)] the prominent physicist E.P.Winer wrote:\n\"Until not many years ago, the \"existence\" of a mind or soul would have been passionately denied by most physical scientists. The brilliant successes of mechanistic and, more generally, macroscopic physics and of chemistry overshadowed the obvious fact that thoughts, desires, and emotions are not made of matter, and it was nearly universally accepted among physical scientists that there is nothing besides matter. The epitome of this belief was the conviction that, if we knew the positions and velocities of all atoms at one instant of time, we could compute the fate of the universe for all future. Even today, there are adherents to this view though fewer among the physicists than - ironically enough -among biochemists.\"\nThe final conclusions made by Wigner were not so close to the modern view on consciousness. Yet the paper of Wigner was very important because he was bold enough to refute traditional materialistic dogmas. He wrote:\n\"The principal argument against materialism is not that illustrated in the last two sections: that it is incompatible with quantum theory. The principal argument is that thought processes and consciousness are the primary concepts, that our knowledge of the external world is the content of our consciousness and that the consciousness, therefore, cannot be denied. On the contrary, logically, the external world could be denied \u00e2\u0080\u0094 though it is not very practical to do so. In the words of Niels Bohr, \"The word consciousness, applied to ourselves as well as to others, is indispensable when dealing with the human situation.\" In view of all this, one may well wonder how materialism, the doctrine that \"life could be explained by sophisticated combinations of physical and chemical laws,\" could so long be accepted by the majority of scientists.\nPhilosophers do not need these illusions and show much more clarity on the subject. The same is true of most truly great natural scientists, at least in their years of maturity. It is now true of almost all physicists \u00e2\u0080\u0094 possibly, but not surely, because of the lesson we learned from quantum mechanics. It is also possible that we learned that the principal problem is no longer the fight with the adversities of nature but the difficulty of understanding ourselves if we want to survive.\"\nWigner remarked that the experience of quantum mechanics is compatible even with solipsism, but not with materialism. I think that such statements had very strong influence on physicists working on the\nconceptual problems of quantum mechanics. Even if they had not immediately great response, they much widened radically the spectrum of possible ways of thinking on the problems of quantum mechanics.\nIt cannot be said that Wigner was the first, who expressed doubt about the applicability of the materialism (in that understanding of this term, which had been accepted among the physicists) for the interpretation of quantum mechanics. On the contrary, all, who seriously thought on the philosophical aspects of quantum mechanics, saw that the traditional approach of physicists must be radically changed (see for example the statement of Pauli cited below in Sect. 11.5.1 at page 233). But Wigner, apparently, went in this direction most boldly.\nAs to my own opinion, the word \"materialism\" may be well-applied even to the combined theory of material and living systems, but the meaning of this world must be very wide. In this case what was traditionally referred as idealism, in many cases may be treated as widely understood materialism. However, to be honestly, the concepts of idealism and materialism become relative and loss their importance.\n11.4.2 Objective and subjective\nThe central point of the methodology of physics and more generally of natural sciences is the objective character of their laws. However, in the framework of quantum mechanics this became doubtful, because the conceptual problems (paradoxes) of quantum theory could not be removed without explicit inclusion of consciousness in the theory.\nThe formulation of quantum mechanics as the purely objectivistic science encountered formidable difficulties. The artificial character of this formulation is clearly seen, for example, in the following explanation given by Schr\u00f6dinger:\n\"Without being aware of it, we exclude the Subject of Cognizance from the domain of nature that we endeavour to understand. We step with our own person back into the part of an onlooker who does not belong to the world, which by this very process becomes an objective world.\" ([Schrodinger (1958)], page 38)\nThe difficulties with objective formulation was a hint that quantum theory, to be logically closed, should include not only objective, but also subjective elements. True, the probabilistic predictions of the behavior of quantum systems could be confirmed by repeated experiments and therefore were objective. But the results of each of the observation (measurement) could be fixed only subjectively, by the observer's consciousness.\nThis hint, treated in the framework of the Everett's Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, became the starting point for formulating the basic points of theory of the conscious itself, as they are presented by Extended Everett's Concept, of Quantum Concept of Consciousness, suggested by the present author.\nFor estimating this theory we need new methodology including both objective and subjective elements. This implies the quite new situation when the new theory either should be treated as not including in the scope of various areas of physics or being included in physics but with the extended notion of physics supplied by the new (extended) methodology, recognizing subjective methods of investigation (observation of the observers own consciousness and transitions between conscious and unconscious states).\nLet us remark in this connection that there is one more area of physics which also needs extended methodology. This is quantum cosmology. This branch of physics has been greatly developed in the last decades, because applying cosmic apparata for research of the cosmic background radiation (issued at the very early stage of the Universe's evolution).\nIt is sometimes said that quantum cosmology (treating early Universe as a quantum system) became an experimental science. This is because the character of Universe' behavior at the very early times after Big Bang (when Universe was quantum) following from the purely theoretical considerations, may now be confirmed by the characteristic features of the background radiation.\nThus obtained confirmation of theory by observations was great sensation some two decades ago. Yet the thorough analysis shows that the results of the observations may be considered to be confirmation of the theory only if the extended methodology is applied that admits as the criterion of truth not only series of repeated measurements but also single events (but having complicated structure). If not extend the methodology in this way, then the observation of the properties of Universe (for example the properties of the background radiation) cannot prove or disprove the laws of quantum cosmology. For reliable proof we need then a series of observations with many identical universes that is evidently impossible [Panov (2010)].\nNevertheless, the results of the observation of the background radiation and their agreement with theoretical predictions were so convincing that most people consider these observations to be the reliable evidence of the theory being valid (at least in general features). Yet, the fact of this agreement \"being convincing\" is not more than the subjective impression. In this case therefore a subjective convincing of something makes\nThe Quantum Concept of Consciousness (QCC) is based on this definition of consciousness. The detailed analysis of this concept shows that thus determined consciousness possesses mystical abilities (super-intuition and the ability to create probabilistic miracles). Thus, starting from the purely materialistic theory (quantum mechanics), we come to the ideal concept of consciousness and to the conclusion that the phenomenon of consciousness must possess mystical features, which are at first glance not at all compatible with the materialism.\nIt is obvious that the Quantum Concept of Consciousness (and in the more general Quantum Concept of Life) contains, in the close unity, as indivisible from each other, the elements, which traditionally are treated correspondingly as material and ideal. From the point of view of this concept, materialism and idealism lose previous meaning, they become relative.\nThe philosophical system, which is compatible with QCC and QCL, can be, if it is convenient, named materialism, but only if we radically broaden understanding of materialism. In any case, this is such materialism, which essentially includes subjective. Soft unification of quantum mechanics with mystical features of consciousness (sphere of science with spiritual sphere) makes uncertain, fuzzy, the boundary between material and ideal.\n11.5 From quantum mechanics to consciousness\nLet us comment on some points in history of ideas that made finally possible formulating Quantum Concept of Consciousness. We shall not follow this history in all its detail, but mention only the issues that illustrate, in some way or another, the status of our Concept.\n11.5.1 Pauli and Jung\nThe basic idea of this book lies in the fact that the mysterious, mystical possibilities of our consciousness are explained by correctly understanding objective reality. The naive understanding of reality, which is based on the everyday experience and which is successfully adapted in classical physics, occurred to be erroneous. It is only quantum mechanics that gives correct understanding of what actually exists and what is only an illusion of our consciousness.\nFrom the first years of existence of quantum mechanics this was manifested in the paradoxes. The paradoxes appeared in quantum mechanics,\nthe physicists to depart from the commonly accepted methodology of the objectivistic science, to extend the methodology.\nThus, consideration of the features of background radiation as a confirmation of the laws of quantum cosmology is meaningless from the point of view of the standard physical methodology [Smolin (2009)], but rejecting these data as the evidences for quantum cosmology seems absurd and is not accepted by the most of the physicists working in this area. They prefer to extend the methodology, although they do not always clearly understand that they do this.\nTherefore, the accepted methodology is not an inviolable law, its extension is possible when the subject of the theory is widen. In case of theory of matter and consciousness, or matter and life, the extension of the subject is much more radical than have ever took place in physics or other natural science. However, this extension is quite reasonable because its results turn out to agree with the whole experience of the mankind (although this is the experience in the spiritual sphere).\n11.4.3 Material and ideal\n\"Consciousness\", \"subjective\" are the concepts which evidently belong to the sphere of ideal. The numerous attempts to explain the phenomenon of consciousness as the result of the work of the brain, are in reality unfounded, if we have in mind the fundamental level of this phenomenon. Various rational thought processes, which occur against the background of consciousness, can be explained by the work of the brain as a material system performing a kind of computational operations. For fulfilling these operations the brain has, of course, the units for input and output of information as well as loops of feedback. However, this does not help to understand what is consciousness (otherwise it would be necessary to say that the computers possess consciousness too, which is intuitively incorrect).\nFrom the other side, the analysis of the logical structure of quantum mechanics shows that it has in it the hint for the possible definition of consciousness, which will be ideally coordinated with this structure, makes it possible to simplify this structure, and moreover, gives interesting consequences. According to this definition, consciousness is the separation of\nI alternatives. Then consciousness is something which leads from quantum\nI reality (co-existence of parallel worlds) to the classical reality (subjective\nperception of only one of these worlds). This is just what may be expected\nas the ability of something that may be called consciousness: the passage\nfrom quantum reality to the classical perception. 1\n\u00e3\u0080\u0080\n4\ncould not be removed and were invariably connected with measurements or observations. Therefore, the paradoxes appeared just when the physicists tried to describe how objectively existing reality may be reflected in the subjective perception of this reality by an observer.\nDespite the fact that the corresponding questions were set already at the dawn of quantum mechanics, answers to them required many decades of experiments and several fundamentally new approaches, connected with the names of the outstanding physicists, beginning from Einstein. It is only in our days that the outlines of the concept appear, which makes it possible to answer these questions.\nThe key idea of this concept is that the phenomenon of consciousness can be explained only with the aid of the statements of quantum mechanics. The resulting theory indicates that the consciousness must possess mystical features, which are substantially connected with the unconscious. This theory, or Quantum Concept of Consciousness, outlined in this book, became possible only after the essential features of quantum reality having been formulated by Everett in the language of parallel worlds.\nThis makes really astonishing that one of the creators of quantum mechanics, Wolfgang Pauli, sufficiently accurately expressed the central idea of the quantum approach to theory of consciousness even before the appearance of the Everett's interpretation. Pauli arrived at this idea in the process of collaboration with the great psychologist Carl Gustav Jung.\nApparently, colleagues of Pauli considered his thoughts (concerning the direct connection of quantum mechanics with the phenomenon of consciousness) to be distrustful. It is possible that also himself considered these issues insufficiently investigated. In any case, Pauli never expressed himself on this question in scientific articles. His considerations concerning this question are known only from his letters to colleagues\u00e2\u0080\u0094physicists. Here are some of them.\nIn 1952, in Pauli's letter to Rosenfeld he wrote:\n\"For the invisible reality, of which we have small pieces of evidence in both quantum physics and the psychology of the unconscious, a symbolic psychophysical unitary language must ultimately be adequate, and this is the far goal which I actually aspire. I am quite confident that the final objective is the same, independent of whether one starts from the psyche (ideas) or from physis (matter). Therefore, I consider the old distinction between materialism and idealism as obsolete.\"\n[Letter by Pauli to Rosenfeld of April 1, 1952. Letter 1391 in [Meyenn (1996)], p. 593. Translated by Harald Atmanspacher and Hans Primas in [Atmanspacher and Primas (2006)]]\nStill earlier he wrote to Pais [Letter by Pauli to Pais of August 17, 1950. Letter 1147 in [Meyenn (1996)], p. 152. Translated by Harald Atmanspacher and Hans Primas in [Atmanspacher and Primas (2006)]]:\n\"The general problem of the relation between psyche and physis, between inside and outside, can hardly be regarded as solved by the term (psychophysical parallelism' advanced in the last century. Yet, perhaps, modern science has brought us closer to a more satisfying conception of this relationship, as it has established the notion of complementarity within physics. It would be most satisfactory if physis and psyche could be conceived as complementary aspects of the same reality.\"\nThese and close to them ideas of Pauli, expressed by him only very briefly and only in the letters, were very long practically unknown. Only in recent years, in connection with the increased interest in the quantum theory of consciousness, they became popular, so that articles and books (see for example [Atmanspacher and Primas (2006)] and [Enz (2009)]). The author of the present book learned about the statements of Pauli only in 2008, when several articles and a book on Quantum Concept of Consciousness were already published by him. The surprising agreement of this concept with the visionary thoughts of Pauli is additional confirmation for it.\n11.5.2 Penrose\nThe well-known mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose was one of those, who in the recent decades made much in order to establish the connection between phenomenon of consciousness and quantum mechanics. However, he thought (and apparently thinks until now) that there are more questions than answers in this area. In the foreword to the book [Abbot, Davies, and Pati (2008)] he wrote:\n\"There is, indeed, a distinct possibility that the broadening of our picture of physical reality that may well be demanded by these considerations is something that will play a central role in any successful theory of the physics underlying the phenomenon of consciousness.\"\nAnd further, characterizing this possibility more concretely, Penrose writes:\n\"... are the special features of strongly quantum-mechanical systems in some way essential? If the latter, then how is the necessary isolation achieved, so that some modes of large-scale quantum coherence can be maintained without their being fatally corrupted by environmental decoherence? Does life in some way make use of the potentiality for vast quantum superpositions, as would be required for serious quantum computation?\"\nIn this statement of Penrose possibility is examined that something similar to a quantum computer may exist in brain. At the same time he sees the difficulties, confronting this hypothesis. Further on Penrose considers possibility of more radical withdrawal from the standard quantum mechanics:\nDo we really need to move forward to radical new theories of physical reality, as I myself believe, before the more subtle issues of biology-most importantly conscious mentality-can be understood in physical terms? How relevant, indeed, is our present lack of understanding of physics at the quantum/classical boundary? Or is consciousness really \"no big deal,\" as has sometimes been expressed?\nIt would be too optimistic to expect to find definitive answers to all these questions, at our present state of knowledge, but there is much scope for healthy debate, and this book provides a profound and very representative measure of it.\nHere Penrose does not discuss the possible role in the explanation of the phenomenon of consciousness, which may be played by the Everett's interpretation (as this is assumed in our Quantum Concept of Consciousness). In the book [Penrose (2004)] he concerns this question. His conclusion, however, is that, earlier than speaking about the usage of the Everett's interpretation, it is necessary to construct theory of consciousness.\nThis is the fundamental difference between the views, which are presented in our book, and by the point of view of Penrose. Instead of independently building theory of consciousness and examining the Everett's interpretation after this, the author of the present book proposed (in 2000) to extract the gists of theory of consciousness from the analysis of the Everett's interpretation. This way proved to be successful, because it led to the logically simple concept of consciousness, which explains the large number of phenomena, which are conventionally considered inexplicable from the scientific point of view.\n11.5.3 Why Quantum Concept of Consciousness was successful\nDuring last decades many attempts were undertaken to explain the phenomenon of life and in particular the phenomenon of consciousness on the basis of quantum mechanics. Studies in this direction were started already in Schr\u00f6dinger [Schr\u00f6dinger (1958)]. Schr\u00f6dinger, in particular, for the first time indicated the important role of quantum mechanics in the fact that in the living systems can have stable discrete characteristics, which are necessary for the transmission of hereditary information. The contemporary survey of different approaches to this problem can be found, for example, in the book [Abbot, Davies, and Pati (2008)].\nExamination and attempts to understand from the point of view of quantum mechanics such uncommon phenomenon as consciousness, is of course especially complex problem. One of the ideas, which they attempt to use for this purpose, is the assumption that some structures in the brain work as a sort of quantum computer.\nIn our view, numerous attempts to explain the phenomenon of consciousness, even with the attraction of quantum mechanics, gave much less impressive results, than the presented in this book Quantum Concept of Consciousness (QCC). This is due to the uncommon approach that has been used in the construction of this concept. This approach was completely not characteristic for physicists, but it proved to be successful for the solution of this problem.\nAttempting to explain the phenomenon of consciousness, physicists go along the way, which is customary for them and seems the only possible. Explicitly or implicitly, they assume that consciousness is a function of the brain, which, therefore, can be explained, relying on the laws of motion of the matter, of which the brain consists. Maximum, that quantum mechanics can give with this approach, is an attempt to consider the brain not as usual (classical) computer, but as a quantum computer. 5 In this case purely physical problem appears \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to explain, why decoherence does not appear, which unavoidably would destroy quantum coherence and convert quantum computer in a classical one. However, even if we are ignore this\n5Versions of this type of construction may exist, but they do not differ qualitatively.\nproblem, it is not nevertheless obvious that the functioning of the brain as a quantum system explains consciousness.\nDuring the construction of QCC (or Extended Everett's Concept, as otherwise this approach is called) reasoning was quite different. Not material objects, but functions were examined in the stage of constructing QCC. We analyzed those functions that have to exist in the theory in order to explain, first, that we know about our world from physics, and second, as we subjectively perceive this world. The basic function, which in this case must be explained, is consciousness, i.e., the appearance of the actually observed subjective picture of the world, on the assumption that objectively the world is such as it is described in physics, which is rested on the enormous experimental material.\nFurther, we can and must, it goes without saying, rest on the subjective idea about the consciousness, which each person from his daily experience has. But from the other side that function, which we want to name consciousness (and which consists of the transfer of the objectively existing world into the subjectively perceived one) must be described also in the terms, characteristic for physics. To accomplish this, the analysis of quantum physics was performed in order to find in it something that could play the role of this function. It turned out that this may be absolutely naturally and unambiguously found within the framework of the Many-World interpretation of quantum mechanics (Everett's interpretation).\nThe analysis of what can follow from this definition of consciousness, gives the unexpected result. It occurs that turning consciousness off (in the state of sleep, trance or meditation) or even simply its disconnection from a certain object makes it possible to go beyond the framework of that subjectively received and to obtain access to the entire objectively existing world. Then the super-intuition, or super-consciousness, appears, i.e. the information becomes accessible, which is principally inaccessible in the completely conscious state.\nAfter thus determined function, named consciousness, is described, the process of constructing the theory could be finished. All necessary already exist in the theory of consciousness. But for comparing this theory with other approaches it is one may raise the question about what role the brain plays. And it occurs that the brain does not generate consciousness, but the brain is a tool of the consciousness. Besides usual functions of information processing, the brain forms the queries, which the super-intuition must answer, and interprets in the usual symbols and by the usual means the information, which appears as answers to these queries.\nThe starting point for the reasoning was the circumstance, that 1) our world is objectively quantum and therefore it must be described in the terms of quantum reality (i.e., its state is described by a superposition of parallel, Everett's, worlds), but 2) subjectively only classical reality is perceived (the illusion appears, that there exists only one of the parallel worlds). The function, named consciousness, consists then of the separation of alternative (Everett's) worlds. The disconnection of this function (sinking into the unconscious) removes the separation, so that the access to the entire set of the parallel worlds appears. This gives the information, which is inaccessible in a single one of these worlds (that subjectively perceived). So we inevitably come to the conclusion that the consciousness (but more precisely, the complex of consciousness and unconscious) possesses mystical properties.\nIf we now look at the final construction (which arose with the analysis of functions), then it appears that the elements of two types coexist and are tightly interlaced in it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 those, which are customary assumed to be material, and those, which are usually treated as ideal. It becomes understandable, why it would be difficult to come to this picture, if we assumed from the very beginning that there were only material objects (molecules, atoms, elementary particles) and everything else might be derived from the properties of these objects. Consciousness and life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this is what cannot be simply derived from the laws of material world (although existence of living systems does not, it goes without saying, contradict these laws). They must be postulated independently (in our scheme, as the corresponding functions).\nBut is not it nevertheless possible to formulate this concept, considering the laws of natural sciences fundamental? Yes, it is possible, but we have then to define life as a special phenomenon, which is presented by the subset of all possible scenarios of the evolution of matter. This subset is called sphere of life. It can be determined by the condition that all scenarios included in the subset (belonging to the sphere of life) satisfy the criteria of life, first of all \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the criterion of survival.\nThis formulation (Quantum Concept of Life, or QCL) may be easily given after we have already arrived at it, having preliminarily constructed the theory (concept) of consciousness. Using this intermediate stage (QCC), we attain that the construction becomes quite plausible and the way leading to this construction practically inevitable. In this way only two arbitrary\n6or, if you want, hypothesis, but which is confirmed by entire experience of quantum mechanics\nassumptions have to be accepted, which form very rigid and simple logic scheme, but they give the huge amount of consequences as a result. These consequences are immediately identified with the well-known facts. True, these are facts from the sphere of spiritual knowledge, but in view of its millennial existence this sphere, in its main points, is not less reliable than the much younger (although supplied by precise methodology) field of natural sciences.\n11.6 Second Quantum Revolution\nThe appearance of quantum mechanics at the beginning of the 20th century was the most great scientific revolution, which affected not only strictly physical laws, but world view of physicists, their philosophical positions. By the great merit of the creators quantum mechanics headed by Nils Bohr was that they succeeded in formulating the so-called Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics. It included the clear rules, which made it possible to make calculations of concrete quantum systems, laying aside the philosophical questions, which are concerned the philosophical comprehension of what stands after these calculations.\nAfter obtaining the possibility to work, without worrying about the deep philosophical comprehension of this work, physicists nevertheless continued the attempts to improve the philosophical aspect of quantum mechanics. This led finally to the concept of quantum reality, i.e., to the understanding, that the idea about what \"real existence\" means, is in the quantum world something different than in the classical world. Finally the Multi-World interpretation of quantum mechanics (Everett's interpretation) was created, which suggests a convenient mathematical apparatus, which expresses quantum reality.\nSeveral decades went by before the Everett's interpretation obtained the acknowledgment of the sufficiently large number of physicists. This occurred, in particular, because the new purely physical tasks, which were appeared in the field of quantum mechanics (first of all, the new kind of its applications, named quantum information theory), directly exploited the specific features of quantum reality. Quantum reality became necessary for the physicists practically, even at the engineering level. This required the comparatively simple formulation of what is understood under quantum reality, and many people understood that the Multi-World interpretation is such a formulation.\nThe mastery of Multi-World interpretation, experience of working with it, made it possible to understand how this interpretation is organic for describing the quantum world when it is necessary to keep your mind on the most striking specific features of this world, quantum reality.\nIn particular, this made it possible to more deeply understand the long ago confronting question about the role of the observer's consciousness in quantum mechanics. After this the question about what is consciousness as such, has been raised in a new way. And then completely unexpectedly the new possibility (actually even need) was opened - to directly connect quantum mechanics with the theory of consciousness. Moreover, it turned out that the direct connection appears between the laws of material world and the laws, long ago formulated in the studies about the spiritual sphere. Any reason disappears for the confronting between matter and spirit, materialism and idealism. On the contrary, it becomes clear that these two spheres of human knowledge require each other not only on the culturological level, but also in the gnosiological aspect.\nAs a result, the new understanding not only of consciousness and spiritual sphere of human, but also of the phenomenon of life is gradually coming.\nWork on the mastery of these new possibilities, new directions for research, by no means finished. It only begins and undoubtedly requires great efforts of the specialists of various profiles. However, it cannot be overestimated that the very posing of the questions in the plan of the unification of material and spiritual, became now completely real. Besides, the powerful conceptual apparatus, developed in quantum mechanics can be used in this work.\nSumming up the above said, one may with the complete right to conclude that the work on the improvement of the interpretation of quantum mechanics lifted in our time to the new level. Some fundamental questions, which appeared already in the period of the creation of quantum mechanics, remained not solved almost entire century. But now they gradually obtain their solutions, leading in this case to the enormous shift in the world view - to the direct unification of the material and spiritual.\nThere is no doubt that we become the witnesses of new scientific revolution. It can be estimated as the completion of that scientific revolution, which began in the period of the creation of quantum mechanics. Instead of this the new stage of quantum mechanics with the complete right can be named the Second Quantum Revolution.\nHeadline 3\n"}, {"score": 2988.4663, "uuid": "4aff040d-7438-551d-9b56-8224fcfbfc76", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1806wb-98-06835", "target_hostname": "wordtrade.com", "target_uri": "http://wordtrade.com/science/physics/quantumconsciousness.htm", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "<em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em> <em>and</em> Consciousness", "snippet": "<em>The</em> naive understanding of reality, which <em>is</em> based on <em>the</em> everyday experience <em>and</em> which <em>is</em> successfully adapted in classical <em>physics</em>, occurred to be erroneous.

Mensky (World Scientific Publishing Company) The phenomenon of consciousness includes mysterious aspects providing a basis for many spiritual doctrines (including religions) and psychological practices. These directions of human knowledge are usually considered to contradict the laws of science. However, quantum mechanics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in a sense, the mysterious direction of science \u00e2\u0080\u0094 allows us to include the phenomena of consciousness and life as well as the relevant phenomena in the sphere of science.\nWolfgang Pauli, one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics, together with great psychologist Carl GustavJung, guessed about the relation between quantum mechanics and consciousness in the beginning of the twentieth century. However, only \"many-worlds\" interpretation of quantum mechanics, proposed in 1957 by Hugh Everett Ill, gave the real basis for the systematic investigation of this relation.\nRoger Penrose, one of the apologists of the relation between quantum mechanics and consciousness, claimed in his Last book \"The Road to Reality\" that the Everett's interpretation may be estimated only after creating the theory of consciousness. There against, the author has proposed in 2000 and further elaborates in this book, the so-called Extended Everett's Concept, that allows one to derive the main features of consciousness and super-consciousness (intuition, or direct vision of truth) from quantum mechanics. This is exposed in this book in a form intelligible for a wide audience.\nThe phenomenon of consciousness demonstrates mystical features that are experienced by some people. All religions and spiritual schools that exist for thousands of years include the mystical component as a necessary part of their message and make use of mystical features of consciousness in their practice.\nNowadays the interest to these phenomena is widespread. It is natural in this situation that actually becomes the question whether the mystical features of consciousness are compatible with science. It turns out that the compatibility is justified if the specific features of quantum mechanics are taken into account.\nThese special features of quantum mechanics are known as \"quantum reality\", i.e. the different concept of reality accepted in quantum mechanics as compared with classical physics. The most adequate expression of the concept of quantum reality is the so-called \"Many-Worlds\" interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed by Everett in 1957. According to this version of quantum mechanics, our world is quantum, and its state is adequately presented by the set of many classical worlds (alternative classical realities), that are equally real (coexist) while existing of only one reality is nothing else than illustion of our consciousness.\nJust this picture of our (quantum) world as the set of parallel (classical) worlds is the key point. The commonly accepted assumption is that the only real (existing) world is that which is subjectively perceived by our consciousness. All considerations become radically different if, instead of this, one accept is that all possible classical states of our world (all alternative realities) parallely exist. This concept allows one to understand what is consciousness and to explain why it possesses mystical features.\nThis book is a review of the author's research on the conceptual structure of quantum mechanics and its connection with the phenomena of\nconsciousness and life. The main ideas are expressed in the book in the simple terms such as parallel worlds (presenting the alternative realities), so that the book is targeted at a wide audience. Those chapters of the book that require special knowledge are notified as written for professional physicists. These chapters may be skipped without detriment for understanding the main line of consideration. Moreover, these chapters may also be skipped by physicists in the first reading of the book.\n\"A Law of Minimization of Mystery: consciousness is mysterious and quantum mechanics is mysterious, so maybe the two mysteries have a common source.\"\nDavid Chalmers\nThe specific quantum approach to the phenomenon of cousciousness (in-ding its mystical abilities) is called Quantum Concept of Consciousness CC). More general considerations concerning the phenomenon of life are toted by the term Quantum Concept of Life (QCL). Nevertheless, when exposing these subjects for physicists with elements of mathematical formalism, we prefer to use the term Extending Everett's Concept (EEC) in ler to underline that the whole approach appeared as a generalization of known interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed by Everett.\nThe interrelations of the three terms may be presented by the following scheme:\nQCC C QCL = EEC\nMost of the material presented in the book is available for people having special knowledge. Some chapters are oriented on professional physicists, t we tried to make this clear from the titles and introductory words of\nchapters. These chapters may be skipped (even by physicists) without triment for understanding the main points of the theory.\nBecause of the attempt to make the book available and interesting both for professional physicists and general audience, some considerations are posed repeatedly. In these cases the style of presentation, its level and\ncontext are different in different parts of the book, so that the repetition should make understanding of difficult ideas easier.\nThe present Foreword briefly explains the specific features of the author's approach for the readers-physicists. Those who are not professional physicists may skip the Foreword and go over to Introduction.\nThis book is about connection between quantum mechanics at one side and the phenomena of consciousness and life at the other side. Assumption about the connection of such different objects as quantum mechanics and consciousness, seems strange and for many people even impossible. Yet it has been discussed from the very moment of creation of quantum mechanics and became very popular in the last decades.\nMost of those who in our time discuss the connection of consciousness with quantum mechanics, look for some quantum effects in the brain that could play a role in the phenomenon of consciousness. For example they may consider the hypotheses that some material structures in the brain operate in fact as a quantum computer. Such an approach is explicitly or implicitly based on the conviction that consciousness is a product of the brain. But is it? What do we know about the nature of consciousness? The thorough analysis shows that we know nothing at all about this important issue.\nThe idea underlying the author's approach is to make no a priori assumption about the nature of consciousness, but rather to describe functions of consciousness in terms which are characteristic of quantum theory (deriving this description from the logical analysis of the concept of \"quantum reality\") and only after this, a posteriori, to judge about the nature of consciousness.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nThe question about the nature and characteristic features of consciousness became important nowadays. The issue of consciousness has been attacked from various directions, but without great success in the important aspects of this issue. The most evident way to clarify the nature of consciousness is investigating the brain that seems to be the origin of consciousness. However, just now, when the instruments for the investigation of the brain became very efficient, it is becoming more and more clear that this direction of research cannot discover the actual nature of consciousness.\nUnexpectedly for many people, the problem of consciousness has been attacked from the viewpoint of quantum mechanics and was connected with the conceptual problems of the quantum mechanics itself. In the course of the research it became clear that this direction is not at all novel. It was initiated as early as in the first quarter of the 20th century by the founding fathers of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrodinger, Wolfgang Pauli and others. However, these genius thinkers had no adequate instruments in their disposal.\nSuch instruments appeared later in the works of Albert Einstein (Einsten\u00e2\u0080\u0094Podolsky\u00e2\u0080\u0094Rosen paradox), John Bell (Bell's theorem), and especially Hough Everett (Everett's, or \"Many-Worlds\" interpretation of quantum mechanics).\nThe proposal of Everett is especially important because it supplies an adequate language for the strange concept of quantum reality, counterintuitive and yet proved to be valid in our world. After Everett, one may say that actual (quantum) reality may be expressed in terms of many coexisting (parallel) classical worlds. This essentially simple (although not very easy for accepting it because of the classical prejudice) presentation of quantum reality allows one to naturally include it in the consideration.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nMost attempts to give quantum explanation for consciousness reduce to looking for the material structures in the brain that could work in quantum coherent regime. This is difficult (and probably impossible) to do because quantum coherence is rapidly destroyed by the process of the inevitable decoherence.\nThe approach proposed by the present author and supported in the present book radically differs from this. We do not make any definite assumption about the nature of consciousness beforehand, particularly we do not assume that consciousness is produced by the brain. Instead we start with the analysis of the logical structure of quantum mechanics and make use of the fact that the concept of \"consciousness of an observer\" necessarily arises in quantum mechanics (in the analysis of the concept of quantum reality) and is adequately formulated in the Everett's \"Many-Worlds\" interpretation of quantum mechanics. Then, on the basis of this logical structure, we make an additional assumption that allows us to formulate the phenomenon of consciousness in terms of the concepts typical for quantum mechanics and simultaneously simplifies the logical structure of quantum mechanics itself.\nOnly after this the question of the nature of consciousness may be posed and resolved. It turns out that the brain does not produce consciousness but is rather an instrument of consciousness. Important processes (first of all super-intuition), that are starting and finishing in consciousness, are performed nevertheless in the unconscious state.Quantum coherency is achieved in these processes because they deal with the quantum reality, i.e. with the whole quantum world. The obstacle of decoherence does not appear in this case because the quantum world as a whole has no environment that could cause decoherence.\nTherefore, starting from functions rather than material carriers of functions turns out the only efficient approach. One of the astonishing conclusions is that some functions have no concrete material carriers or, alternatively, have the whole world as their carrier. This leads in fact to the unification of the sphere of material with the spiritual sphere.\nThe idea that this approach may be fruitful appeared during the preparation of the review at the famous Ginzburg's seminar in Moscow. The aim of the review was the novel applications of quantum mechanics called quantum information. However, this issue is closely connected with the foundations of quantum mechanics. In the process of work on this topic it unexpectedly occurred to me that the main features of consciousness including its mystical abilities are explained if a simple logical construction is added to conventional quantum mechanics. Especially exciting was that this additional assumption actually simplified the logical structure of quantum mechanics.\nThis was astonishing and led to further investigations that revealed the deep interconnection between the concept of quantum mechanics and the phenomena characteristic for life. It turned out that mysterious character of life explains those features of quantum mechanics that are counter-intuitive and vice versa. The most deep theory of inanimate matter expressed in the form of quantum mechanics supplies just those notions and abilities that are necessary for understanding of the (otherwise mysterious) phenomena of consciousness and life.\nThe central role in this internal connection is the so-called \"quantum reality\" . This counter-intuitive concept was investigated in various ways beginning from the famous Einstein\u00e2\u0080\u0094Podolsky\u00e2\u0080\u0094Rosen paradox and ending by Everett's interpretation.\nThe Everett's picture of actually quantum world as the set of many coexisting parallel worlds (alternative classical realities) expresses the concept of quantum reality in the most transparent way. If one thinks about consciousness, keeping in mind that actual reality is not a single classical world but many equally real (although subjectively seeming to be alternative, excluding each other) classical worlds (as alive and dead Scr\u00f6dinger cat), he/she understands what is consciousness including its mystical features (super-intuition, or direct vision of truth, and even how one may \"manage reality\" ).\nThis conclusion appeared unexpectedly, but actually it has been prepared by the long history of insights of genius physicists into the internal sense of quantum mechanics. It seems that now we are also close to the better understanding of what is quantum mechanics. It is exciting that this new level of understanding is directly connected with the phenomena of life and consciousness.\nPhysicists do not usually recognize that the character of their work may depend on their philosophical position. The majority of physicists looks at the philosophy condescendingly, considering it not as science but the skill of the manipulation by words. However, the interrelation of physics and philosophy become significant for physicists and are actively discussed at the key moments of the development of physics.\nTwo aspects of these interrelations are then important. First, physicists discover that their specific philosophical views (or at least the methodological principles accepted by them) nevertheless influence their work (first of all this concerns the methods of interpreting experimental results. Second, the qualitatively new achievements of physics change the philosophical position occupied by most of physicists. These processes are tightly connected with a change in the methodology, which turns out to be necessary in connection with the new achievements. All this together is the passage to a new paradigm in the science.\nThe period of creating quantum mechanics (the first third of 20th century), which coincided with the period of creating special and general theory of relativity, was such critical epoch in physics. These enormous developments in physics, especially quantum mechanics, overturned the world view of physicists, particularly forcing them to abandon too limited understanding of materialism.\nApparently, physics experiences now a similar period of an active change in the paradigm, and particularly in philosophy of physics. The change is necessary because of realizing the close connection of quantum theory with the phenomenon of consciousness.\n11.4.1 Wigner\nIn the seminal paper [Wigner (1961)] the prominent physicist E.P.Winer wrote:\n\"Until not many years ago, the \"existence\" of a mind or soul would have been passionately denied by most physical scientists. The brilliant successes of mechanistic and, more generally, macroscopic physics and of chemistry overshadowed the obvious fact that thoughts, desires, and emotions are not made of matter, and it was nearly universally accepted among physical scientists that there is nothing besides matter. The epitome of this belief was the conviction that, if we knew the positions and velocities of all atoms at one instant of time, we could compute the fate of the universe for all future. Even today, there are adherents to this view though fewer among the physicists than - ironically enough -among biochemists.\"\nThe final conclusions made by Wigner were not so close to the modern view on consciousness. Yet the paper of Wigner was very important because he was bold enough to refute traditional materialistic dogmas. He wrote:\n\"The principal argument against materialism is not that illustrated in the last two sections: that it is incompatible with quantum theory. The principal argument is that thought processes and consciousness are the primary concepts, that our knowledge of the external world is the content of our consciousness and that the consciousness, therefore, cannot be denied. On the contrary, logically, the external world could be denied \u00e2\u0080\u0094 though it is not very practical to do so. In the words of Niels Bohr, \"The word consciousness, applied to ourselves as well as to others, is indispensable when dealing with the human situation.\" In view of all this, one may well wonder how materialism, the doctrine that \"life could be explained by sophisticated combinations of physical and chemical laws,\" could so long be accepted by the majority of scientists.\nPhilosophers do not need these illusions and show much more clarity on the subject. The same is true of most truly great natural scientists, at least in their years of maturity. It is now true of almost all physicists \u00e2\u0080\u0094 possibly, but not surely, because of the lesson we learned from quantum mechanics. It is also possible that we learned that the principal problem is no longer the fight with the adversities of nature but the difficulty of understanding ourselves if we want to survive.\"\nWigner remarked that the experience of quantum mechanics is compatible even with solipsism, but not with materialism. I think that such statements had very strong influence on physicists working on the\nconceptual problems of quantum mechanics. Even if they had not immediately great response, they much widened radically the spectrum of possible ways of thinking on the problems of quantum mechanics.\nIt cannot be said that Wigner was the first, who expressed doubt about the applicability of the materialism (in that understanding of this term, which had been accepted among the physicists) for the interpretation of quantum mechanics. On the contrary, all, who seriously thought on the philosophical aspects of quantum mechanics, saw that the traditional approach of physicists must be radically changed (see for example the statement of Pauli cited below in Sect. 11.5.1 at page 233). But Wigner, apparently, went in this direction most boldly.\nAs to my own opinion, the word \"materialism\" may be well-applied even to the combined theory of material and living systems, but the meaning of this world must be very wide. In this case what was traditionally referred as idealism, in many cases may be treated as widely understood materialism. However, to be honestly, the concepts of idealism and materialism become relative and loss their importance.\n11.4.2 Objective and subjective\nThe central point of the methodology of physics and more generally of natural sciences is the objective character of their laws. However, in the framework of quantum mechanics this became doubtful, because the conceptual problems (paradoxes) of quantum theory could not be removed without explicit inclusion of consciousness in the theory.\nThe formulation of quantum mechanics as the purely objectivistic science encountered formidable difficulties. The artificial character of this formulation is clearly seen, for example, in the following explanation given by Schr\u00f6dinger:\n\"Without being aware of it, we exclude the Subject of Cognizance from the domain of nature that we endeavour to understand. We step with our own person back into the part of an onlooker who does not belong to the world, which by this very process becomes an objective world.\" ([Schrodinger (1958)], page 38)\nThe difficulties with objective formulation was a hint that quantum theory, to be logically closed, should include not only objective, but also subjective elements. True, the probabilistic predictions of the behavior of quantum systems could be confirmed by repeated experiments and therefore were objective. But the results of each of the observation (measurement) could be fixed only subjectively, by the observer's consciousness.\nThis hint, treated in the framework of the Everett's Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, became the starting point for formulating the basic points of theory of the conscious itself, as they are presented by Extended Everett's Concept, of Quantum Concept of Consciousness, suggested by the present author.\nFor estimating this theory we need new methodology including both objective and subjective elements. This implies the quite new situation when the new theory either should be treated as not including in the scope of various areas of physics or being included in physics but with the extended notion of physics supplied by the new (extended) methodology, recognizing subjective methods of investigation (observation of the observers own consciousness and transitions between conscious and unconscious states).\nLet us remark in this connection that there is one more area of physics which also needs extended methodology. This is quantum cosmology. This branch of physics has been greatly developed in the last decades, because applying cosmic apparata for research of the cosmic background radiation (issued at the very early stage of the Universe's evolution).\nIt is sometimes said that quantum cosmology (treating early Universe as a quantum system) became an experimental science. This is because the character of Universe' behavior at the very early times after Big Bang (when Universe was quantum) following from the purely theoretical considerations, may now be confirmed by the characteristic features of the background radiation.\nThus obtained confirmation of theory by observations was great sensation some two decades ago. Yet the thorough analysis shows that the results of the observations may be considered to be confirmation of the theory only if the extended methodology is applied that admits as the criterion of truth not only series of repeated measurements but also single events (but having complicated structure). If not extend the methodology in this way, then the observation of the properties of Universe (for example the properties of the background radiation) cannot prove or disprove the laws of quantum cosmology. For reliable proof we need then a series of observations with many identical universes that is evidently impossible [Panov (2010)].\nNevertheless, the results of the observation of the background radiation and their agreement with theoretical predictions were so convincing that most people consider these observations to be the reliable evidence of the theory being valid (at least in general features). Yet, the fact of this agreement \"being convincing\" is not more than the subjective impression. In this case therefore a subjective convincing of something makes\nThe Quantum Concept of Consciousness (QCC) is based on this definition of consciousness. The detailed analysis of this concept shows that thus determined consciousness possesses mystical abilities (super-intuition and the ability to create probabilistic miracles). Thus, starting from the purely materialistic theory (quantum mechanics), we come to the ideal concept of consciousness and to the conclusion that the phenomenon of consciousness must possess mystical features, which are at first glance not at all compatible with the materialism.\nIt is obvious that the Quantum Concept of Consciousness (and in the more general Quantum Concept of Life) contains, in the close unity, as indivisible from each other, the elements, which traditionally are treated correspondingly as material and ideal. From the point of view of this concept, materialism and idealism lose previous meaning, they become relative.\nThe philosophical system, which is compatible with QCC and QCL, can be, if it is convenient, named materialism, but only if we radically broaden understanding of materialism. In any case, this is such materialism, which essentially includes subjective. Soft unification of quantum mechanics with mystical features of consciousness (sphere of science with spiritual sphere) makes uncertain, fuzzy, the boundary between material and ideal.\n11.5 From quantum mechanics to consciousness\nLet us comment on some points in history of ideas that made finally possible formulating Quantum Concept of Consciousness. We shall not follow this history in all its detail, but mention only the issues that illustrate, in some way or another, the status of our Concept.\n11.5.1 Pauli and Jung\nThe basic idea of this book lies in the fact that the mysterious, mystical possibilities of our consciousness are explained by correctly understanding objective reality. The naive understanding of reality, which is based on the everyday experience and which is successfully adapted in classical physics, occurred to be erroneous. It is only quantum mechanics that gives correct understanding of what actually exists and what is only an illusion of our consciousness.\nFrom the first years of existence of quantum mechanics this was manifested in the paradoxes. The paradoxes appeared in quantum mechanics,\nthe physicists to depart from the commonly accepted methodology of the objectivistic science, to extend the methodology.\nThus, consideration of the features of background radiation as a confirmation of the laws of quantum cosmology is meaningless from the point of view of the standard physical methodology [Smolin (2009)], but rejecting these data as the evidences for quantum cosmology seems absurd and is not accepted by the most of the physicists working in this area. They prefer to extend the methodology, although they do not always clearly understand that they do this.\nTherefore, the accepted methodology is not an inviolable law, its extension is possible when the subject of the theory is widen. In case of theory of matter and consciousness, or matter and life, the extension of the subject is much more radical than have ever took place in physics or other natural science. However, this extension is quite reasonable because its results turn out to agree with the whole experience of the mankind (although this is the experience in the spiritual sphere).\n11.4.3 Material and ideal\n\"Consciousness\", \"subjective\" are the concepts which evidently belong to the sphere of ideal. The numerous attempts to explain the phenomenon of consciousness as the result of the work of the brain, are in reality unfounded, if we have in mind the fundamental level of this phenomenon. Various rational thought processes, which occur against the background of consciousness, can be explained by the work of the brain as a material system performing a kind of computational operations. For fulfilling these operations the brain has, of course, the units for input and output of information as well as loops of feedback. However, this does not help to understand what is consciousness (otherwise it would be necessary to say that the computers possess consciousness too, which is intuitively incorrect).\nFrom the other side, the analysis of the logical structure of quantum mechanics shows that it has in it the hint for the possible definition of consciousness, which will be ideally coordinated with this structure, makes it possible to simplify this structure, and moreover, gives interesting consequences. According to this definition, consciousness is the separation of\nI alternatives. Then consciousness is something which leads from quantum\nI reality (co-existence of parallel worlds) to the classical reality (subjective\nperception of only one of these worlds). This is just what may be expected\nas the ability of something that may be called consciousness: the passage\nfrom quantum reality to the classical perception. 1\n\u00e3\u0080\u0080\n4\ncould not be removed and were invariably connected with measurements or observations. Therefore, the paradoxes appeared just when the physicists tried to describe how objectively existing reality may be reflected in the subjective perception of this reality by an observer.\nDespite the fact that the corresponding questions were set already at the dawn of quantum mechanics, answers to them required many decades of experiments and several fundamentally new approaches, connected with the names of the outstanding physicists, beginning from Einstein. It is only in our days that the outlines of the concept appear, which makes it possible to answer these questions.\nThe key idea of this concept is that the phenomenon of consciousness can be explained only with the aid of the statements of quantum mechanics. The resulting theory indicates that the consciousness must possess mystical features, which are substantially connected with the unconscious. This theory, or Quantum Concept of Consciousness, outlined in this book, became possible only after the essential features of quantum reality having been formulated by Everett in the language of parallel worlds.\nThis makes really astonishing that one of the creators of quantum mechanics, Wolfgang Pauli, sufficiently accurately expressed the central idea of the quantum approach to theory of consciousness even before the appearance of the Everett's interpretation. Pauli arrived at this idea in the process of collaboration with the great psychologist Carl Gustav Jung.\nApparently, colleagues of Pauli considered his thoughts (concerning the direct connection of quantum mechanics with the phenomenon of consciousness) to be distrustful. It is possible that also himself considered these issues insufficiently investigated. In any case, Pauli never expressed himself on this question in scientific articles. His considerations concerning this question are known only from his letters to colleagues\u00e2\u0080\u0094physicists. Here are some of them.\nIn 1952, in Pauli's letter to Rosenfeld he wrote:\n\"For the invisible reality, of which we have small pieces of evidence in both quantum physics and the psychology of the unconscious, a symbolic psychophysical unitary language must ultimately be adequate, and this is the far goal which I actually aspire. I am quite confident that the final objective is the same, independent of whether one starts from the psyche (ideas) or from physis (matter). Therefore, I consider the old distinction between materialism and idealism as obsolete.\"\n[Letter by Pauli to Rosenfeld of April 1, 1952. Letter 1391 in [Meyenn (1996)], p. 593. Translated by Harald Atmanspacher and Hans Primas in [Atmanspacher and Primas (2006)]]\nStill earlier he wrote to Pais [Letter by Pauli to Pais of August 17, 1950. Letter 1147 in [Meyenn (1996)], p. 152. Translated by Harald Atmanspacher and Hans Primas in [Atmanspacher and Primas (2006)]]:\n\"The general problem of the relation between psyche and physis, between inside and outside, can hardly be regarded as solved by the term (psychophysical parallelism' advanced in the last century. Yet, perhaps, modern science has brought us closer to a more satisfying conception of this relationship, as it has established the notion of complementarity within physics. It would be most satisfactory if physis and psyche could be conceived as complementary aspects of the same reality.\"\nThese and close to them ideas of Pauli, expressed by him only very briefly and only in the letters, were very long practically unknown. Only in recent years, in connection with the increased interest in the quantum theory of consciousness, they became popular, so that articles and books (see for example [Atmanspacher and Primas (2006)] and [Enz (2009)]). The author of the present book learned about the statements of Pauli only in 2008, when several articles and a book on Quantum Concept of Consciousness were already published by him. The surprising agreement of this concept with the visionary thoughts of Pauli is additional confirmation for it.\n11.5.2 Penrose\nThe well-known mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose was one of those, who in the recent decades made much in order to establish the connection between phenomenon of consciousness and quantum mechanics. However, he thought (and apparently thinks until now) that there are more questions than answers in this area. In the foreword to the book [Abbot, Davies, and Pati (2008)] he wrote:\n\"There is, indeed, a distinct possibility that the broadening of our picture of physical reality that may well be demanded by these considerations is something that will play a central role in any successful theory of the physics underlying the phenomenon of consciousness.\"\nAnd further, characterizing this possibility more concretely, Penrose writes:\n\"... are the special features of strongly quantum-mechanical systems in some way essential? If the latter, then how is the necessary isolation achieved, so that some modes of large-scale quantum coherence can be maintained without their being fatally corrupted by environmental decoherence? Does life in some way make use of the potentiality for vast quantum superpositions, as would be required for serious quantum computation?\"\nIn this statement of Penrose possibility is examined that something similar to a quantum computer may exist in brain. At the same time he sees the difficulties, confronting this hypothesis. Further on Penrose considers possibility of more radical withdrawal from the standard quantum mechanics:\nDo we really need to move forward to radical new theories of physical reality, as I myself believe, before the more subtle issues of biology-most importantly conscious mentality-can be understood in physical terms? How relevant, indeed, is our present lack of understanding of physics at the quantum/classical boundary? Or is consciousness really \"no big deal,\" as has sometimes been expressed?\nIt would be too optimistic to expect to find definitive answers to all these questions, at our present state of knowledge, but there is much scope for healthy debate, and this book provides a profound and very representative measure of it.\nHere Penrose does not discuss the possible role in the explanation of the phenomenon of consciousness, which may be played by the Everett's interpretation (as this is assumed in our Quantum Concept of Consciousness). In the book [Penrose (2004)] he concerns this question. His conclusion, however, is that, earlier than speaking about the usage of the Everett's interpretation, it is necessary to construct theory of consciousness.\nThis is the fundamental difference between the views, which are presented in our book, and by the point of view of Penrose. Instead of independently building theory of consciousness and examining the Everett's interpretation after this, the author of the present book proposed (in 2000) to extract the gists of theory of consciousness from the analysis of the Everett's interpretation. This way proved to be successful, because it led to the logically simple concept of consciousness, which explains the large number of phenomena, which are conventionally considered inexplicable from the scientific point of view.\n11.5.3 Why Quantum Concept of Consciousness was successful\nDuring last decades many attempts were undertaken to explain the phenomenon of life and in particular the phenomenon of consciousness on the basis of quantum mechanics. Studies in this direction were started already in Schr\u00f6dinger [Schr\u00f6dinger (1958)]. Schr\u00f6dinger, in particular, for the first time indicated the important role of quantum mechanics in the fact that in the living systems can have stable discrete characteristics, which are necessary for the transmission of hereditary information. The contemporary survey of different approaches to this problem can be found, for example, in the book [Abbot, Davies, and Pati (2008)].\nExamination and attempts to understand from the point of view of quantum mechanics such uncommon phenomenon as consciousness, is of course especially complex problem. One of the ideas, which they attempt to use for this purpose, is the assumption that some structures in the brain work as a sort of quantum computer.\nIn our view, numerous attempts to explain the phenomenon of consciousness, even with the attraction of quantum mechanics, gave much less impressive results, than the presented in this book Quantum Concept of Consciousness (QCC). This is due to the uncommon approach that has been used in the construction of this concept. This approach was completely not characteristic for physicists, but it proved to be successful for the solution of this problem.\nAttempting to explain the phenomenon of consciousness, physicists go along the way, which is customary for them and seems the only possible. Explicitly or implicitly, they assume that consciousness is a function of the brain, which, therefore, can be explained, relying on the laws of motion of the matter, of which the brain consists. Maximum, that quantum mechanics can give with this approach, is an attempt to consider the brain not as usual (classical) computer, but as a quantum computer. 5 In this case purely physical problem appears \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to explain, why decoherence does not appear, which unavoidably would destroy quantum coherence and convert quantum computer in a classical one. However, even if we are ignore this\n5Versions of this type of construction may exist, but they do not differ qualitatively.\nproblem, it is not nevertheless obvious that the functioning of the brain as a quantum system explains consciousness.\nDuring the construction of QCC (or Extended Everett's Concept, as otherwise this approach is called) reasoning was quite different. Not material objects, but functions were examined in the stage of constructing QCC. We analyzed those functions that have to exist in the theory in order to explain, first, that we know about our world from physics, and second, as we subjectively perceive this world. The basic function, which in this case must be explained, is consciousness, i.e., the appearance of the actually observed subjective picture of the world, on the assumption that objectively the world is such as it is described in physics, which is rested on the enormous experimental material.\nFurther, we can and must, it goes without saying, rest on the subjective idea about the consciousness, which each person from his daily experience has. But from the other side that function, which we want to name consciousness (and which consists of the transfer of the objectively existing world into the subjectively perceived one) must be described also in the terms, characteristic for physics. To accomplish this, the analysis of quantum physics was performed in order to find in it something that could play the role of this function. It turned out that this may be absolutely naturally and unambiguously found within the framework of the Many-World interpretation of quantum mechanics (Everett's interpretation).\nThe analysis of what can follow from this definition of consciousness, gives the unexpected result. It occurs that turning consciousness off (in the state of sleep, trance or meditation) or even simply its disconnection from a certain object makes it possible to go beyond the framework of that subjectively received and to obtain access to the entire objectively existing world. Then the super-intuition, or super-consciousness, appears, i.e. the information becomes accessible, which is principally inaccessible in the completely conscious state.\nAfter thus determined function, named consciousness, is described, the process of constructing the theory could be finished. All necessary already exist in the theory of consciousness. But for comparing this theory with other approaches it is one may raise the question about what role the brain plays. And it occurs that the brain does not generate consciousness, but the brain is a tool of the consciousness. Besides usual functions of information processing, the brain forms the queries, which the super-intuition must answer, and interprets in the usual symbols and by the usual means the information, which appears as answers to these queries.\nThe starting point for the reasoning was the circumstance, that 1) our world is objectively quantum and therefore it must be described in the terms of quantum reality (i.e., its state is described by a superposition of parallel, Everett's, worlds), but 2) subjectively only classical reality is perceived (the illusion appears, that there exists only one of the parallel worlds). The function, named consciousness, consists then of the separation of alternative (Everett's) worlds. The disconnection of this function (sinking into the unconscious) removes the separation, so that the access to the entire set of the parallel worlds appears. This gives the information, which is inaccessible in a single one of these worlds (that subjectively perceived). So we inevitably come to the conclusion that the consciousness (but more precisely, the complex of consciousness and unconscious) possesses mystical properties.\nIf we now look at the final construction (which arose with the analysis of functions), then it appears that the elements of two types coexist and are tightly interlaced in it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 those, which are customary assumed to be material, and those, which are usually treated as ideal. It becomes understandable, why it would be difficult to come to this picture, if we assumed from the very beginning that there were only material objects (molecules, atoms, elementary particles) and everything else might be derived from the properties of these objects. Consciousness and life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this is what cannot be simply derived from the laws of material world (although existence of living systems does not, it goes without saying, contradict these laws). They must be postulated independently (in our scheme, as the corresponding functions).\nBut is not it nevertheless possible to formulate this concept, considering the laws of natural sciences fundamental? Yes, it is possible, but we have then to define life as a special phenomenon, which is presented by the subset of all possible scenarios of the evolution of matter. This subset is called sphere of life. It can be determined by the condition that all scenarios included in the subset (belonging to the sphere of life) satisfy the criteria of life, first of all \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the criterion of survival.\nThis formulation (Quantum Concept of Life, or QCL) may be easily given after we have already arrived at it, having preliminarily constructed the theory (concept) of consciousness. Using this intermediate stage (QCC), we attain that the construction becomes quite plausible and the way leading to this construction practically inevitable. In this way only two arbitrary\n6or, if you want, hypothesis, but which is confirmed by entire experience of quantum mechanics\nassumptions have to be accepted, which form very rigid and simple logic scheme, but they give the huge amount of consequences as a result. These consequences are immediately identified with the well-known facts. True, these are facts from the sphere of spiritual knowledge, but in view of its millennial existence this sphere, in its main points, is not less reliable than the much younger (although supplied by precise methodology) field of natural sciences.\n11.6 Second Quantum Revolution\nThe appearance of quantum mechanics at the beginning of the 20th century was the most great scientific revolution, which affected not only strictly physical laws, but world view of physicists, their philosophical positions. By the great merit of the creators quantum mechanics headed by Nils Bohr was that they succeeded in formulating the so-called Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics. It included the clear rules, which made it possible to make calculations of concrete quantum systems, laying aside the philosophical questions, which are concerned the philosophical comprehension of what stands after these calculations.\nAfter obtaining the possibility to work, without worrying about the deep philosophical comprehension of this work, physicists nevertheless continued the attempts to improve the philosophical aspect of quantum mechanics. This led finally to the concept of quantum reality, i.e., to the understanding, that the idea about what \"real existence\" means, is in the quantum world something different than in the classical world. Finally the Multi-World interpretation of quantum mechanics (Everett's interpretation) was created, which suggests a convenient mathematical apparatus, which expresses quantum reality.\nSeveral decades went by before the Everett's interpretation obtained the acknowledgment of the sufficiently large number of physicists. This occurred, in particular, because the new purely physical tasks, which were appeared in the field of quantum mechanics (first of all, the new kind of its applications, named quantum information theory), directly exploited the specific features of quantum reality. Quantum reality became necessary for the physicists practically, even at the engineering level. This required the comparatively simple formulation of what is understood under quantum reality, and many people understood that the Multi-World interpretation is such a formulation.\nThe mastery of Multi-World interpretation, experience of working with it, made it possible to understand how this interpretation is organic for describing the quantum world when it is necessary to keep your mind on the most striking specific features of this world, quantum reality.\nIn particular, this made it possible to more deeply understand the long ago confronting question about the role of the observer's consciousness in quantum mechanics. After this the question about what is consciousness as such, has been raised in a new way. And then completely unexpectedly the new possibility (actually even need) was opened - to directly connect quantum mechanics with the theory of consciousness. Moreover, it turned out that the direct connection appears between the laws of material world and the laws, long ago formulated in the studies about the spiritual sphere. Any reason disappears for the confronting between matter and spirit, materialism and idealism. On the contrary, it becomes clear that these two spheres of human knowledge require each other not only on the culturological level, but also in the gnosiological aspect.\nAs a result, the new understanding not only of consciousness and spiritual sphere of human, but also of the phenomenon of life is gradually coming.\nWork on the mastery of these new possibilities, new directions for research, by no means finished. It only begins and undoubtedly requires great efforts of the specialists of various profiles. However, it cannot be overestimated that the very posing of the questions in the plan of the unification of material and spiritual, became now completely real. Besides, the powerful conceptual apparatus, developed in quantum mechanics can be used in this work.\nSumming up the above said, one may with the complete right to conclude that the work on the improvement of the interpretation of quantum mechanics lifted in our time to the new level. Some fundamental questions, which appeared already in the period of the creation of quantum mechanics, remained not solved almost entire century. But now they gradually obtain their solutions, leading in this case to the enormous shift in the world view - to the direct unification of the material and spiritual.\nThere is no doubt that we become the witnesses of new scientific revolution. It can be estimated as the completion of that scientific revolution, which began in the period of the creation of quantum mechanics. Instead of this the new stage of quantum mechanics with the complete right can be named the Second Quantum Revolution.\nHeadline 3\n"}, {"score": 2983.846, "uuid": "f5597264-8789-5b32-8e2f-0e0541cea599", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1204wb-69-01236", "target_hostname": "www.newdualism.org", "target_uri": "http://www.newdualism.org/papers/K.Ludwig/psyche-2-16-ludwig.html", "page_rank": 1.1778908e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Why <em>the</em> <em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em> <em>Quantum</em> <em>and</em> Classical <em>Physics</em> <em>is</em> Irrelevant", "snippet": "First, I present an account of <em>what</em> that problem <em>is</em>, how it can be motivated independently of <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> classical <em>and</em> <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em>, <em>and</em> <em>what</em> <em>the</em> basic logical options are in responding to it.", "explanation": null, "document": "Henry Stapp's book Mind, Matter, and Quantum Mechanics may be purchased\nfrom Amazon.Com\nWhy the Difference Between Quantum and Classical Physics is Irrelevant to the Mind/Body Problem\nKirk Ludwig\nCopyright (c) Kirk Ludwig 1995\nPSYCHE, 2(16), September, 1995\nhttp://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/v2/psyche-2-16-ludwig.html , archived at www.newdualism.org\nKEYWORDS: Consciousness, eliminativism, emergentism, mind/body problem, quantum mechanics, reductionism.\nPSYCHE, 2(5)\n.\nABSTRACT: I argue that the logical difference between classical and quantum mechanics that Stapp (1995) claims shows quantum mechanics is more amenable to an account of consciousness than is classical mechanics is irrelevant to the problem.\n1. Introduction\n1.1 Henry Stapp (1995) argues that \"classical mechanics is not constitutionally suited to accommodate consciousness, whereas quantum mechanics is\" (abstract). This, he asserts, is because of \"certain logical deficiencies\" that are not present in quantum mechanics (1.3). The ground advanced for this claim is that classical mechanics holds that a \"physical system is to be conceived of as fundamentally a conglomerate of simple microscopic elements each of which interacts only with its immediate neighbors\" (2.12). In particular, a classical description of a system will include a description of field values at points in the system, but these descriptions record only what is going on at each of the points, and not features of the system as a whole. Stapp adds, \"One may, of course,\npostulate\nsome extra notion of 'emergence'. But nature must be able to confer some kind of beingness beyond what is entailed by the precepts of classical mechanics in order to elevate the brain correlate of a belief to the status of an ontological whole\" (2.12). As I understand Stapp, the crucial difference between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics is supposed to be that in the latter the basic vector description of the system can include information about the whole of the system and not just about points in the system: \"each of the 2 x (2L+1)^(M x N)^ registers in the quantum mechanical description of the computer/brain corresponds to a possible correlated state of activity of the\nentire\nclassically-conceived computer/brain\" (3.10).\n1.2 I contend that this difference between classical and quantum mechanics is irrelevant to the traditional mind/body problem, of which the problem of understanding the relation between consciousness and our bodies is one part. First, I present an account of what that problem is, how it can be motivated independently of the difference between classical and quantum mechanics, and what the basic logical options are in responding to it. Second, I show that the difference between classical and quantum mechanics that Stapp focuses on does not distinguish between the various logical options in responding to the problem, and thus that it does not in itself provide any solution to it. Third, I argue that any solution that is open to the quantum theorist is equally open to the classical theorist.\n2. The Mind/Body Problem\n2.1 There are many different mind/body problems, so it would be a mistake to try to describe 'the' mind/body problem. But the problem I will present has been a central problem in the tradition in the philosophy of mind, and is one of the central problems about the relation of mental to non-mental properties and phenomena, and it is the one in particular with which Stapp is concerned. The problem is generated by a set of propositions all of which can be given strong motivations, and yet which are jointly inconsistent.\nSome objects have mental properties.\nThe fundamental constituents of objects (i.e., the objects to be listed in the catalog of particle physics) do not have mental properties.\nMental properties are not conceptually or definitionally reducible to non-mental properties.\nEvery feature of every object is deducible from a complete description of it in terms of its fundamental constituents and their properties and relations.\nThe problem is that from (2)-(4) we can deduce the negation of (1). That is the mind/body problem. (The consciousness/body problem is the mind/body problem restricted to mental properties the possession of which entail that their possessor is conscious or potentially conscious.)\n2.2 Responses to the mind/body problem can be classified according to which of the above four jointly inconsistent propositions they reject. For example, the Cartesian substance dualist rejects (2), by arguing that there are objects which have mental properties which are not composite. (This is the ancient view that the mind or soul is a simple substance.) The panpsychist, who holds that all non-complex objects have mental properties also rejects (2) (e.g., Leibniz--see Nagel for a recent discussion). The eliminativist (e.g., Churchland) rejects (1). The reductionist (e.g., the functionalist) rejects (3). Finally, the emergentist rejects (4).\n2.3 The problem can be motivated independently of concern for the differences between classical and quantum mechanics. To motivate (1), we need only the assumption that we know that we have mental states. To motivate (2), we need only the following two assumptions. The first is that no basically new sorts of entities have come into existence since the Big Bang--i.e., the list of fundamental physical particles has not changed since the Big Bang, or, at least, no new sorts of particles have appeared which cannot be characterized in terms of the same family of properties which we draw on in describing those originally present. <1> The second is that at some time in the past no objects had mental properties. To motivate (3), we can appeal to the apparent conceivability of non-material thinking beings. Finally, to motivate (4), we can appeal to the success of science in explaining the behavior of complex systems in terms of laws governing their constituents. These are all powerful motivations. That is why the mind/body problem is so hard. But none of these motivations depend on the features of physical theory that distinguish classical from quantum mechanics. Thus, we should be skeptical of any claim that a solution to our problem is to be found by focusing on such differences.\n3. Quantum Mechanics and the Mind/Body Problem\n3.1 Any solution to the mind/body problem must reject one of the assumptions that generate it. Our first question is whether the difference Stapp points to between classical and quantum mechanics shows that if one accepts one or the other of these theories one must reject one or another of the assumptions that generate the problem. The answer is 'no' because the difference Stapp points to, as he acknowledges, is purely a logical one. The difference hinges on whether the vectors in the basic description of a physical system contain information only about points or also contain information about the whole system. Nothing about that difference bears on whether any of the elements in the vectors entail that the system has mental properties, or that it does not. So this difference between classical and quantum mechanics makes no difference with respect to propositions (1) and (2). As a matter of fact, of course, neither classical nor quantum mechanics assigns mental properties to the basic constituents of objects. But this has nothing to do with whether vectors in the basic physical description of a system encode information only about points in the system or about the system as a whole as well. The logical difference likewise does not speak to the conceptual relations between mental and physical properties, and so does not bear on proposition (3). Nor does the logical difference bear on whether or not the theories are complete, and so it does not bear on proposition (4). Therefore the difference which Stapp identifies in the structure of classical and quantum mechanics is logically irrelevant to the mind/body problem.\n3.2 Our second question is whether one of the solutions to the mind/body problem is more problematic for classical than for quantum mechanics. If so, then there would still be an important point to focusing on the details of each for the purposes of resolving the mind/body problem. But precisely because of the independence of the logical structure of each from the above four propositions, there is no solution that the quantum theorist could adopt which the classical theorist could not adopt as well, and vice versa.\n3.3 Let us leave aside dualism and panpsychism, which, although logical options, have little more to recommend them, either on the classical or quantum mechanical view. That leaves us with eliminativism (rejecting (1)), reductionism (rejecting (3)), or emergentism (rejecting (4)).\n3.4 Clearly, if eliminativism is an option for either view, it is an option for both. The issue here is basically epistemic. Is our evidence for the existence of mental state epistemically prior to our evidence that our physical theories are complete, even in the event that they do not make room for any mental properties? Since our evidence for any theory in part depends on our sensory experience, and, indeed, to be in a position to theorize at all requires having beliefs and desires, eliminativism is self-defeating. We could embrace it only at the cost of making incoherent our justification for believing the theories which are supposed to support it. But in any case it is clear that the issue is independent of the differences between quantum and classical mechanics.\n3.5 What about reductionism? The main contender for an adequate reductionist theory of mind nowadays is functionalism (see Dennett, e.g.), or a combination of functionalism with externalism (the view that what thoughts we have depends on our relations, particularly our causal relations, to things in our environments). However, quantum mechanics offers no advantage over classical mechanics here, since the terms required for defining the relevant functional organizations and relations are no more than those required to describe, e.g., the functional organization of a computer, and its causal relations to macroscopic objects, which can be accomplished independently of how our fundamental physics works out. That leaves conceptual reduction of mental properties to physical properties at the level of basic theory, but this is equally implausible on either classical or quantum mechanics.\n3.6 The only hope, then, of finding a position that quantum mechanics favors over classical mechanics lies in emergentism. I assume that emergentism is in fact the position which Stapp adopts. But emergentism is as much an option for the classical view as it is for the quantum view. Indeed, emergentism first became prominent in the latter part of the 19th Century (though, in fact, both functionalism and emergentism were anticipated by the Ancients). The point which Stapp seems to think favors quantum mechanics over classical mechanics here has to do with whether the vectors of the description of a physical system themselves contain information about the whole system. But this is relevant only if one thinks that in describing how mental properties are related to physical properties on the emergentist view one must (a) treat the emergent property as a property of an aggregate of particles and (b) treat the emergent property (as seems reasonable) as nomically dependent on some property of the whole system it is a property of and (c) require that the property be one information about which can be recovered from that contained in a vector in the basic physical description of the system. We can grant the first two requirements, but there is no justification for the third. Even if a vector description of a classical system does not contain in each vector information about the whole system, from the complete description of the system one can of course recover information about the whole system. There is no conceptual or logical difficulty in an emergent property nomically supervening on a property ascribed to a system by a description of it in terms of vectors which record information only about points in or elements of the system. (A property P supervenes on a family of properties B (B1,...,Bn) if and only if for any object x, and any property Bi in B, it is nomically necessary that if x has Bi, then x has P, and for any object x, it is nomically necessary that if x has P, then x has one of the properties in the family B. That one property (merely) nomically supervened on another (or family of others) would not be a fact that emerged from an examination of the physics of the fundamental constituents of matter.) There is no interesting sense, then, in which quantum mechanics is more friendly to emergentism than is classical mechanics.\n3.7 I conclude that the difference between quantum and classical physics is irrelevant to the mind/body problem.\nNotes\n<1> I am indebted to Scott Hagan for drawing my attention to the need for this qualification.\nReferences\nChurchland, P.

Initially the theory used the ideas of classical (Newtonian) mechanics to explain several features exhibited by the hydrogen atom. In addition to the rules of classical mechanics, there was one extra rule that was \"tacked on\". The extra rule said that a certain property, called the \"action\", of a closed path for a classical particle must be an integer multiple of a constant called \"h-bar\". Basically, the idea is that if a particle (like an electron in an atom) travels in a circle then that circular path must have an action equal to h-bar, or 2 h-bar, or 3-hbar, etc. This turned out to be sufficient to explain the hydrogen atom, but it could not explain many other atomic phenomena.\nEventually, a new theory was developed that could account for all of the observed atomic phenomena. This theory came in two different forms: one described an atomic system using something called a wavefunction, the other described the system using matrices. The two versions turn out to be equivalent to each other. In addition to providing a mathematical way to describe an atomic system, this new theory also provided a set of rules to determine the behavior of the quantum system in much the same way that Newton's Laws determine the behavior of a classical system. However, this new theory of quantum mechanics is by no means equivalent to Newton's Laws. There are some major differences between classical and quantum mechanics, and these differences are important for our discussion of quantum chaos.\nMajor Differences Between Newton's Laws and Quantum Mechanics\nIn classical mechanics a particle can have any energy and any speed. In quantum mechanics these quantities are quantized. This means that a particle in a quantum system can only have certain values for its energy, and certain values for its speed (or momentum). These special values are called the energy or momentum eigenvalues of the quantum system. Associated with each eigenvalue is a special state called an eigenstate. The eigenvalues and eigenstates of a quantum system are the most important features for characterizing that systems behavior. There are no eigenvalues or eigenstates in classical mechanics.\nNewton's Laws allow one, in principle, to determine the exact location and velocity of a particle at some future time. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, only determines the probability for a particle to be in a certain location with a certain velocity at some future time. The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics makes it very different from classical mechanics.\nQuantum mechanics incorporates what is known as the \"Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle\" . This principle states that one cannot know the location AND velocity of a quantum particle to infinite accuracy. The better you know the particle's location, the more uncertain you must be about its velocity, and vice versa. In practice, the level of uncertainty that is required is so small that it is only noticeable when you are dealing with very tiny things like atoms. This is why we cannot see the effects of the Uncertainty Principle in our daily lives.\nQuantum mechanics permits what are called \"superpositions of states\". This means that a quantum particle can be in two different states at the same time. For instance, a particle can actually be located in two different places at one time. This is certainly not possible in classical mechanics.\nQuantum mechanical systems can exhibit a number of other very interesting features, such as tunneling and entanglement. These features also represent significant differences between classical and quantum mechanics, although they will not be as important in our discussion of quantum chaos.\nThat is a pretty brief introduction to the ideas of quantum mechanics and many important features have been skipped.

A cat is penned up in a steel chamber, along with the following diabolical device (which must be secured against direct interference by the cat): in a Geiger counter there is a tiny bit of radioactive substance, so small that perhaps in the course of one hour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability, perhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a relay releases a hammer which shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic acid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed. The first atomic decay would have poisoned it. The Psi function for the entire system would express this by having in it the living and the dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal parts.\nIt is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy originally restricted to the atomic domain becomes transformed into macroscopic indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct observation. That prevents us from so naively accepting as valid a ``blurred model'' for representing reality. In itself it would not embody anything unclear or contradictory. There is a difference between a shaky or out-of-focus photograph and a snapshot of clouds and fog banks[ 45 ].\nSchr\u00f6dinger's cat is neither dead nor alive. It is in a superposition of possibilities until someone takes a peak. Neils Bohr , the author of the Copenhagen Interpretation , thought that that there were two separate domains: the macroscopic world of every day experience and the quantum domain. Events only occurred at the macroscopic level. Consciousness is the link between these domains. Conscious observations force a collapse of the quantum wave function to accord with the observation. Prior to that the wave function embodied all the possible states that might be observed including even a live and dead cat.\nIf you think this is nonsense you are not alone. There are competing interpretations. The most popular is \"shut up and calculate .\" This says do not worry about interpretations. The mathematics must compute probabilities that conform to experimental observation. That is what is important.\nA popular interpretation among physicists is called `Many Worlds'. It assumes all the possibilities exist physically in different realities. It takes the wave function as the primary reality and experimental observations as secondary. To take the mathematical models one has created as the primary reality is a violation of the spirit of science which makes nature the final arbiter through experiments.\nFundamental physical models are the simplest possible descriptions of what we have observed experimentally. We have no way of knowing how accurately they reflect the true structure of physical reality. It is possible to construct radically different models that give nearly identical experimental predictions. Physics was able to progress only by ignoring the religious dogma of the day. Unfortunately each new generation of scientists in every field has a tendency to create new dogmas.\nTo conclude we have gone beyond classical logic or mathematics requires compelling experimental evidence. Problems that suggest this possibility are for more likely to be a product of the limitations of our existing understanding. Philosophies that magnify those limitations into new realities disguise rather than confront our limitations.\nEinstein always felt that the problem was not finding a correct interpretation but in developing a more complete theory. As mentioned in Section 7.1 Einstein came to suspect near the end of his life that a more complete theory must move away from continuous structures. In the next two section we outline a possible approach to developing a more complete theory.\nThis discussion of a more complete theory is speculative and intuitive. Developing properties of discrete models on a scale that could describe the fundamental particles of physics is far beyond existing technology and available mathematical techniques. Speculation is valuable in suggesting alternative possibilities. This can influence how one looks at existing experimental results and the priorities given to future experiments.\nQuantum mechanics was developed by theoreticians and experimenters working together. Results from each side influenced the other. It is inconceivable that a theory as strange and remarkable as quantum mechanics could have emerged as a complete theoretical structure that only needed verification as was the case with special and general relativity.\nDeveloping a more complete theory will almost certainly require a similar collaborative effort of experimentalists and theoreticians feeding each others understanding and intuition. If the more complete theory requires `digital' space-time than this is almost certainly true. Thus speculation that might help generate experiments that point in a new direction may be essential. Bell's Theorem (see Section 8.4 ) establishes that a more complete theory of the sort Einstein sought will be experimentally distinguishable from quantum mechanics. It will be not just more complete but correct in instances when quantum mechanics makes incorrect predictions. Recognizing that there is a direction that may lead to an alternative theory can influence how one evaluates the existing experimental tests of Bell's Inequality (see Section 8.6 ).\n"}, {"score": 2884.7747, "uuid": "3a21236a-b512-5339-a6f0-ab05056d24a4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0005wb-51-32974", "target_hostname": "physics.about.com", "target_uri": "http://physics.about.com/od/quantumphysicsbooks/tp/quantumbooks.htm", "page_rank": 1.2796958e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "<em>Quantum</em> <em>Physics</em> Books - books about <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em> - list of <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em>", "snippet": "<em>Quantum</em> <em>physics</em> <em>is</em> one of <em>the</em> most complex concepts in modern <em>physics</em> <em>and</em> a number of books have come out in an effort to explain these <em>quantum</em> concepts to <em>the</em> general public.

This was a very perplexing problem, and still remains so if we try to visualize what matterenergy looks like at the elementary level. A particle is localized in spacetime -- it can be assigned very distinct coordinates, and even thought of as stationary and static. A wave is not localized and cannot be static.\nThe wave-particle duality is one of the best examples of the complementarity principle in quantum theory. An electron, for example, will either act like a particle or a wave, but never both at the same time. If we use a particle detector to see the electron, it will be a particle, and if we use a wave detector, it will be a wave. Somehow, we must think of the electron as being both, but in its ability to display both modes of mutually exclusive states of being, it is actually neither. The essence of what the electron really is must be something else entirely. Whatever that is, is quite impossible to visualize, and has been dubbed a wavicle.\nQuantum Mechanics\nCREDITS: Fermilab, images and text\nMuch of the work in particle physics is guided by the principles of quantum mechanics. Originally devised to explain the way the atom works, the theory underlies most of the ideas that define how scientists view the world of subatomic physics.\nThe basic postulates of quantum mechanics:\n\u0095Particles actually have a wave nature and can be described as a wave function of any of their coordinates (position, momentum, angle, energy) so that if the wave function is squared, it represents a probability function of that coordinate.\n\u0095If you prepare two samples, each having a wave function that demands the probability of a certain outcome, then if the samples are totally identical in every way, the wave functions must be added first, and then squared. Because part of the wave function is imaginary, any phase difference between the two functions (regardless of the amplitude) will result in an effect on the result whereas if one squares and then adds, the phase difference is washed out. This is the principle of interference and is common to all wave phenomena. In quantum mechanics however, the square of the wave function represents a probability as opposed to an actual distribution of some quantity.\nThe wave function of a particle must satisfy boundary conditions. The diagram at left shows three simple functions which fit exactly an integer number of wavelengths between the two walls.\nSince there are usually conditions at boundaries that the wave function must obey, a string being tied at both ends for example, the wave function is constrained. This will allow only certain wavelengths to exist. The walls in quantum mechanics are actually potential energy wells. The probability of a particle to exist outside of its potential well boundary must drop to zero in some way. This is the principal of quantization.\nThis is true for all quantum systems. Interesting phenomena arise when we introduce special relativity into quantum mechanics. One of these is spin. Particles revolving around one another can have what is known as angular momentum, and particles with a size can spin like a top. Although the spin in quantum mechanics can be described similarly, it is not the same as ordinary spin. For example, the electron has no size, it is a point particle, but it has a quantity known as spin which is different from the classical notion of spin. Spin is important in classifying the various particles and in how they interact with each other.\nThe ElectroWeak Force\nCREDITS: Fermilab\nOne of the major goals of elementary particle science is showing that even though particles may interact in somewhat different ways, they are utterly controlled by the same guiding principles. During the early part of the 20th century, as the first particles were discovered, the forces acting on them were eventually classified as electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear. As time went on, scientists realized that the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces were really one and the same force. The electroweak force fully explains the interactions (very well) of all the known leptons at the energy scales attainable so far.\nIt is hard to detect this at small energies, but as accelerators allowed the scientists to use more energetic interactions, the evidence became clear that forces would unify at a larger energy. On the other hand, a difficulty arose in that the gauge bosons or force carrying particles of the weak nuclear force have large masses. The force carrying particle of the electromagnetic force is the photon which is massless. Since it is massless, two bare electric charges can interact over an infinite distance (if they are the only charges around). The weak nuclear force can only act over a distance on the order of magnitude of the nuclear size.\nBoth the electromagnetic and weak force arise from gauge theories. This means the particles are \"representations of a group\" - or they define a mathematical structure whose elements interact in a definite way governed by the transformations of the group. When two different groups are combined together, they don't always form a composite group. In the electroweak case, fortunately, they do.\nOne of the interesting phenomenon about this force is CP violation. This is one of the spacetime symmetries which is violated at the energies seen in the lab and has been experimentally observed but is postulated to be recovered as very high energies are attained. The mechanism by which the violation is though to occur is by a Goldstone boson known as the Higgs particle. Through the process, both the weak force carriers (W+,W-,Z), and the Higgs boson itself acquire a large mass.\nQuantum Chromodynamics\nCREDITS: Fermilab, images and text\nThe color force, also known as the strong nuclear force, gets its name not from any real color that we can see, but because scientists could not think of what to call it. The force itself is real though. It is a property of quarks and gluons, responsible for binding quarks together to form protons and neutrons and binding quark-antiquark pairs to form mesons.\nAn interesting property of particles with color is their confinement within the proton. Quarks come in three shades, (call them red, blue, green for convenience). If you combine a red quark and an anti-red anti-quark, the net object is colorless. If you combine red, blue, and green together, the net object (proton for example) is also colorless. A bare quark or gluon (with a net color) has never been observed. The interaction of bare partons (quarks or gluons) with incoming projectiles such as electrons has been inferred through\nThe color force is an example of a gauge theory, a theory using relativistic quantum mechanics and principles of symmetry to summarize how particles with a charge interact. Particles with color charge interact via the color force although they may have other charges such as an electric charge. Therefore there may be multiple forces acting on the particle. Electromagnetism can be formulated as a U(1) type gauge theory under the banner of Quantum Electrodynamics. The color force is an SU(3) type gauge theory. The U(1) and SU(3) correspond to the symmetry governing the interactions.\n"}, {"score": 2870.046, "uuid": "218e5ea5-c6bc-5444-b714-73eae134a30f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1712wb-99-24169", "target_hostname": "www.statemaster.com", "target_uri": "http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia/Quantum-mechanics", "page_rank": 1.3127847e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "StateMaster - Encyclopedia: <em>Quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em>", "snippet": "Main <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> classical <em>and</em> <em>quantum</em> theories have already been mentioned above in <em>the</em> remarks on <em>the</em> Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.", "explanation": null, "document": "Search encyclopedia, statistics and forums:\n(* = Graphable)\nFor a generally accessible and less technical introduction to the topic, see Introduction to quantum mechanics .\nQuantum mechanics\nIntroduction to...\nMathematical formulation of...

In quantum mechanics, it refers to a discrete(separate) unit that quantum theory assigns to certain physical quantities, such as the energy of an atom at rest (see Figure 1, at right). The discovery that waves have discrete energy packets (called quanta ) that behave in a manner similar to particles led to the branch of physics that deals with atomic and subatomic systems which we today call quantum mechanics. It is the underlying mathematical framework of many fields of physics and chemistry , including condensed matter physics , solid-state physics , atomic physics , molecular physics , computational chemistry , quantum chemistry , particle physics , and nuclear physics . The foundations of quantum mechanics were established during the first half of the twentieth century by Werner Heisenberg , Max Planck , Louis de Broglie , Albert Einstein , Niels Bohr , Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger , Max Born , John von Neumann , Paul Dirac , Wolfgang Pauli and others .

Below is a list of famous physicists. ...\nIt is currently necessary to use quantum mechanics to understand the behavior of systems at atomic length scales and smaller. For example, if Newtonian mechanics governed the workings of an atom, electrons would rapidly travel towards and collide with the nucleus .

The nucleus of an atom is the very small dense region, of positive charge, in its centre consisting of nucleons (protons and neutrons). ...\nQuantum mechanics was initially developed to provide a better explanation of the atom, especially the spectra of light emitted by different atomic species . The quantum theory of the atom developed as an explanation for the electron's staying in its orbital , which could not be explained by Newton's laws of motion and by Maxwell's laws of classical electromagnetism.

Maxwells equations are the set of four equations, attributed to James Clerk Maxwell (written by Oliver Heaviside), that describe the behavior of both the electric and magnetic fields, as well as their interactions with matter. ...\nIn the formalism of quantum mechanics, the state of a system at a given time is described by a complex wave function (sometimes referred to as orbitals in the case of atomic electrons), and more generally, elements of a complex vector space . This abstract mathematical object allows for the calculation of probabilities of outcomes of concrete experiments. For example, it allows one to compute the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus at a particular time. Contrary to classical mechanics, one can never make simultaneous predictions of conjugate variables , such as position and momentum, with arbitrary accuracy. For instance, electrons may be considered to be located somewhere within a region of space, but with their exact positions being unknown. Contours of constant probability, often referred to as \u201cclouds\u201d may be drawn around the nucleus of an atom to conceptualize where the electron might be located with the most probability. It should be stressed that the electron itself is not spread out over such cloud regions. It is either in a particular region of space, or it is not [citation needed]. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle quantifies the inability to precisely locate the particle.

In quantum physics, the outcome of even an ideal measurement of a system is not deterministic, but instead is characterized by a probability distribution, and the larger the associated standard deviation is, the more uncertain we might say that that characteristic is for the system. ...\nThe other exemplar that led to quantum mechanics was the study of electromagnetic waves such as light. When it was found in 1900 by Max Planck that the energy of waves could be described as consisting of small packets or quanta, Albert Einstein exploited this idea to show that an electromagnetic wave such as light could be described by a particle called the photon with a discrete energy dependent on its frequency. This led to a theory of unity between subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves called wave\u2013particle duality in which particles and waves were neither one nor the other, but had certain properties of both. While quantum mechanics describes the world of the very small, it also is needed to explain certain \u201c macroscopic quantum systems\u201d such as superconductors and superfluids .

Fig. ...\nRelativity and quantum mechanics\nThe modern world of physics is notably founded on two tested and demonstrably sound theories of general relativity and quantum mechanics \u2014theories which appear to contradict one another. The defining postulates of both Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum theory are indisputably supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence. However, while they do not directly contradict each other theoretically (at least with regard to primary claims), they are resistant to being incorporated within one cohesive model.\nEinstein himself is well known for rejecting some of the claims of quantum mechanics. While clearly inventive in this field, he did not accept the more philosophic consequences and interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as the lack of deterministic causality and the assertion that a single subatomic particle can occupy numerous areas of space at one time. He also was the first to notice some of the apparently exotic consequences of entanglement and used them to formulate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, in the hope of showing that quantum mechanics has unacceptable implications. This was 1935, but in 1964 it was shown by John Bell (see Bell inequality ) that Einstein's assumption that quantum mechanics is correct, but has to be completed by hidden variables, was based on wrong philosophical assumptions: according to the paper of J. Bell and the Copenhagen interpretation (the common interpretation of quantum mechanics by physicists for decades), and contrary to Einstein's ideas, quantum mechanics is It has been suggested that Quantum coherence be merged into this article or section. ...

Thus, the current logic of correspondence principle between classical and quantum mechanics is that all objects obey laws of quantum mechanics, and classical mechanics is just a quantum mechanics of large systems (or a statistical quantum mechanics of a large collection of particles). Laws of classical mechanics thus follow from laws of quantum mechanics at the limit of large systems or large quantum numbers. In physics, the correspondence principle is a principle, first invoked by Niels Bohr in 1923, which states that the behavior of quantum mechanical systems reduce to classical physics in the limit of large quantum numbers. ...\nMain differences between classical and quantum theories have already been mentioned above in the remarks on the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox . Essentially the difference boils down to the statement that quantum mechanics is coherent (addition of amplitudes), whereas classical theories are incoherent (addition of intensities). Thus, such quantities as coherence lengths and coherence times come into play. For microscopic bodies the extension of the system is certainly much smaller than the coherence length; for macroscopic bodies one expects that it should be the other way round. In quantum mechanics, the EPR paradox is a thought experiment which challenged long-held ideas about the relation between the observed values of physical quantities and the values that can be accounted for by a physical theory. ...

One of the oldest and most commonly used formulations is the transformation theory proposed by Cambridge theoretical physicist Paul Dirac , which unifies and generalizes the two earliest formulations of quantum mechanics, matrix mechanics (invented by Werner Heisenberg ) [2] and wave mechanics (invented by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger ). The term transformation theory refers to a procedure used by P. A. M. Dirac in his early formulation of quantum theory, from around 1927. ...

Examples of observables include energy , position , momentum , and angular momentum . Observables can be either continuous (e.g., the position of a particle) or discrete (e.g., the energy of an electron bound to a hydrogen atom). Probability densities for the electron at different quantum numbers (l) In quantum mechanics, the quantum state of a system is a set of numbers that fully describe a quantum system. ...

In mathematics, a continuous function is a function for which, intuitively, small changes in the input result in small changes in the output. ... Discrete mathematics, also called finite mathematics, is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete, in the sense of not supporting or requiring the notion of continuity. ...\nGenerally, quantum mechanics does not assign definite values to observables. Instead, it makes predictions about probability distributions ; that is, the probability of obtaining each of the possible outcomes from measuring an observable. Naturally, these probabilities will depend on the quantum state at the instant of the measurement. There are, however, certain states that are associated with a definite value of a particular observable. These are known as \"eigenstates\" of the observable (\"eigen\" can be roughly translated from German as inherent or as a characteristic). In the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of everything being in an eigenstate of every observable. Everything appears to have a definite position, a definite momentum, and a definite time of occurrence. However, quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values for the position or momentum of a certain particle in a given space in a finite time; rather, it only provides a range of probabilities of where that particle might be. Therefore, it became necessary to use different words for (a) the state of something having an uncertainty relation and (b) a state that has a definite value. The latter is called the \"eigenstate\" of the property being measured. A probability distribution describes the values and probabilities that a random event can take place. ...\nFor example, consider a free particle . In quantum mechanics, there is wave-particle duality so the properties of the particle can be described as a wave. Therefore, its quantum state can be represented as a wave , of arbitrary shape and extending over all of space, called a wave function . The position and momentum of the particle are observables. The Uncertainty Principle of quantum mechanics states that both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be known with infinite precision at the same time. However, one can measure just the position alone of a moving free particle creating an eigenstate of position with a wavefunction that is very large at a particular position x, and almost zero everywhere else. If one performs a position measurement on such a wavefunction, the result x will be obtained with almost 100% probability. In other words, the position of the free particle will almost be known. This is called an eigenstate of position (mathematically more precise: a generalized eigenstate ( eigendistribution ) ). If the particle is in an eigenstate of position then its momentum is completely unknown. An eigenstate of momentum, on the other hand, has the form of a plane wave . It can be shown that the wavelength is equal to h/p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the eigenstate . If the particle is in an eigenstate of momentum then its position is completely blurred out. In physics a free particle is a particle that is never under the influence of an external force Classical Free Particle The classical free particle is characterized simply by a fixed velocity. ...

In linear algebra, the eigenvectors (from the German eigen meaning inherent, characteristic) of a linear operator are non-zero vectors which, when operated on by the operator, result in a scalar multiple of themselves. ...\nUsually, a system will not be in an eigenstate of whatever observable we are interested in. However, if one measures the observable, the wavefunction will instantaneously be an eigenstate (or generalized eigenstate) of that observable. This process is known as wavefunction collapse . It involves expanding the system under study to include the measurement device, so that a detailed quantum calculation would no longer be feasible and a classical description must be used. If one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement, one will be able to compute the probability of collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates. For example, the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wavefunction that is a wave packet centered around some mean position x0, neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum. When one measures the position of the particle, it is impossible to predict with certainty the result that we will obtain. It is probable, but not certain, that it will be near x0, where the amplitude of the wave function is large. After the measurement is performed, having obtained some result x, the wave function collapses into a position eigenstate centered at x. In certain interpretations of quantum mechanics, wavefunction collapse is one of two processes by which quantum systems apparently evolve according to the laws of quantum mechanics. ... The wave packet is one of the most widely misunderstood and misused concepts in physics. ...\nWave functions can change as time progresses. An equation known as the Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes how wave functions change in time, a role similar to Newton's second law in classical mechanics. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation, applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle, predicts that the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity, like a classical particle with no forces acting on it. However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more uncertain. This also has the effect of turning position eigenstates (which can be thought of as infinitely sharp wave packets) into broadened wave packets that are no longer position eigenstates. For a non-technical introduction to the topic, please see Introduction to quantum mechanics. ... Newtons laws of motion are the three scientific laws which Isaac Newton discovered concerning the behaviour of moving bodies. ...\nSome wave functions produce probability distributions that are constant in time. Many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such \"static\" wave functions. For example, a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus , whereas in quantum mechanics it is described by a static, spherically symmetric wavefunction surrounding the nucleus ( Fig. 1 ). (Note that only the lowest angular momentum states, labeled s, are spherically symmetric). For other uses, see Electron (disambiguation). ... For other uses, see Atom (disambiguation). ...

During a measurement , the change of the wavefunction into another one is not deterministic, but rather unpredictable, i.e., random . This article is about the general notion of determinism in philosophy. ...

Random redirects here. ...\nThe probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement. This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand. It was the central topic in the famous Bohr-Einstein debates , in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of thought experiments. In the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a \"measurement\" has been extensively studied. Interpretations of quantum mechanics have been formulated to do away with the concept of \"wavefunction collapse\"; see, for example, the relative state interpretation . The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wavefunctions become entangled , so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity. For details, see the article on measurement in quantum mechanics . Probability is the likelihood that something is the case or will happen. ...

The framework of quantum mechanics requires a careful definition of measurement, and a thorough discussion of its practical and philosophical implications. ...\nMathematical formulation\nSee also: Quantum logic\nIn the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics, developed by Paul Dirac and John von Neumann , the possible states of a quantum mechanical system are represented by unit vectors (called \"state vectors\") residing in a complex separable Hilbert space (variously called the \"state space\" or the \"associated Hilbert space\" of the system) well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the projectivization of a Hilbert space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system; for example, the state space for position and momentum states is the space of square-integrable functions, while the state space for the spin of a single proton is just the product of two complex planes. Each observable is represented by a maximally-Hermitian (precisely: by a self-adjoint ) linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. If the operator's spectrum is discrete, the observable can only attain those discrete eigenvalues. The mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics is the body of mathematical formalisms which permits a rigorous description of quantum mechanics. ... In mathematical physics and quantum mechanics, quantum logic can be regarded as a kind of propositional logic suitable for understanding the apparent anomalies regarding quantum measurement, most notably those concerning composition of measurement operations of complementary variables. ...

For a non-technical introduction to the topic, please see Introduction to quantum mechanics. ... The quantum Hamiltonian is the physical state of a system, which may be characterized as a ray in an abstract Hilbert space (or, in the case of ensembles, as a trace class operator with trace 1). ... In mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, an operator is a linear transformation from a Hilbert space to itself. ...\nThe inner product between two state vectors is a complex number known as a probability amplitude . During a measurement, the probability that a system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate is given by the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator - which explains the choice of Hermitian operators, for which all the eigenvalues are real. We can find the probability distribution of an observable in a given state by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is represented by the statement that the operators corresponding to certain observables do not commute . In mathematics, an inner product space is a vector space with additional structure, an inner product (also called a scalar product), which allows us to introduce geometrical notions such as angles and lengths of vectors. ... In quantum mechanics, a probability amplitude is a complex-valued function that describes an uncertain or unknown quantity. ...

In mathematics, the commutator gives an indication of the extent to which a certain binary operation fails to be commutative. ...\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation acts on the entire probability amplitude, not merely its absolute value. Whereas the absolute value of the probability amplitude encodes information about probabilities, its phase encodes information about the interference between quantum states. This gives rise to the wave-like behavior of quantum states. This article is about a portion of a periodic process. ... For other uses, see Interference (disambiguation). ...\nIt turns out that analytic solutions of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation are only available for a small number of model Hamiltonians , of which the quantum harmonic oscillator , the particle in a box , the hydrogen-molecular ion and the hydrogen atom are the most important representatives. Even the helium atom, which contains just one more electron than hydrogen, defies all attempts at a fully analytic treatment. There exist several techniques for generating approximate solutions. For instance, in the method known as perturbation theory one uses the analytic results for a simple quantum mechanical model to generate results for a more complicated model related to the simple model by, for example, the addition of a weak potential energy . Another method is the \"semi-classical equation of motion\" approach, which applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces weak deviations from classical behavior. The deviations can be calculated based on the classical motion. This approach is important for the field of quantum chaos . The field of quantum mechanics is based on solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is often represented (in its non-relativistic form) as Where is the wavefunction of the system, H is the Hamiltonian operator, and T and V are the operators for the kinetic energy and potential energy...

Richard Feynman Richard Phillips Feynman (May 11, 1918\u2013February 15, 1988) (surname pronounced FINE-man) was one of the most influential American physicists of the 20th century, expanding greatly the theory of quantum electrodynamics. ... This article or section is in need of attention from an expert on the subject. ... In physics, the action principle is an assertion about the nature of motion from which the trajectory of an object subject to forces can be determined. ...\nInteractions with other scientific theories\nThe fundamental rules of quantum mechanics are very broad. They assert that the state space of a system is a Hilbert space and the observables are Hermitian operators acting on that space, but do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators, or if it even exists. These must be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system. An important guide for making these choices is the correspondence principle , which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical physics when a system moves to higher energies or equivalently, larger quantum numbers. In other words, classic mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large systems. This \"high energy\" limit is known as the classical or correspondence limit. One can therefore start from an established classical model of a particular system, and attempt to guess the underlying quantum model that gives rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit The mathematical concept of a Hilbert space (named after the German mathematician David Hilbert) generalizes the notion of Euclidean space in a way that extends methods of vector algebra from the plane and three-dimensional space to spaces of functions. ...

While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles. A fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of quantum field theory , which applies quantization to a field rather than a fixed set of particles. The first complete quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics , provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction .

A series of quantum explained phenomena are also described.\nA Little History on Mechanics\nClassical or Newtonian mechanics appeared on the 17th century and was very successful in describing the physics of the macroscopic world. However, in the beginning of the 20th century, experiments revealed a series of atomic and subatomic phenomena that could not be explained by the old theory. This triggered the development of Quantum mechanics.\nMain Principles of Classical Mechanics\nIn classical mechanics a system can be described by a number of dynamic variables. The goal is to be able to calculate the exact values of these variables at any given time and determine how these values evolve as a function of time t. Once the position x(t) of a particle within an one-dimensional system is known, a series of other variables such as the velocity \u03bd(t), acceleration \u03b1(t), momentum p(t), potential V and kinetic energy K can be calculated. Newton's Law is the basis of classical mechanics:\nF = m\u03b1 or F = dp/dt\nwhere F is the force acting on the particle and m the mass of the particle\nMain Principles of Quantum Mechanics\nClassical mechanics failed to describe an atomic system using the above principles, and further attempts and experimental observations led to the development of quantum theory. Given the new theory, a system can now be described by a state function \u03a8 and not a set of dynamic variables. This complicated wave function is the solution of Schr \u00f6dinger's equation , the equivalent to Newton's Law in classical mechanics.\nThe statistical nature of the state function indicates the probability of finding a particle within a spatial range, in contrast to the Newtonian mechanics where a particle's position can be accurately defined.\nQuantum mechanics also accepts the quantization of energy, momentum, etc, when the classical view can only accept a continuous range of values for each variable. In addition, a particle in Quantum mechanics contains an amount of energy even at ground state. This is due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, where the exact values of two complimentary variables can never be measured simultaneously. The energy at ground level for the classical mechanics is always zero.\nThe Double Slit Experiment of Young Showing the Dual Nature of Electrons\nPhenomena Explained by the Quantum Theory\nQuantum Mechanics became fundamental in the modern world after having explained a series of phenomena:\nBlackbody radiation: The classical approach could not predict and explain the spectrum curve of the blackbody radiation in the UV frequencies. This is also known as the \u201cUV catastrophe.\u201d Max Planck assumed that the oscillators' energy takes discrete instead of continuous values. The quantization of energy gave a new prediction that matched the experimental values.\nPhotoelectric effect: From a classical point of view, light behaves as an electromagnetic wave that induces the ejection of electrons from a metal's surface due to the oscillations caused by the incident wave. However, the experiment showed that the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons could not be calculated accurately by the wave theory. Einstein introduced the idea of quantized packets of energy; the photons and discovered that the electrons' kinetic energy is a function of the photon energy and a material's constant.\nDuality of wave/particle: Apart from photons, electrons can also behave as particles or waves, depending on the situation. This duality, accepted only by quantum mechanics, explained the interferences phenomena occurring in Young's Double Slit experiment.\nOther phenomena such as the Tunnel ing Effect are only possible if we accept that the subatomic world is ruled by quantum laws.\nQuantum Mechanics Explain the Tunelling Effect Where a Particle is Possible to Pass Through a Classically Impenetratable Barrier\nClassical or Quantum?\nThe classical view is still successful when referring to large and low velocity systems.

In my paper I show that Kipling was not completely right. I try to show the common ground between Buddhist philosophy and quantum physics. There is a surprising parallelism between the philosophical concept of reality articulated by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and the physical concept of reality implied by quantum physics. For neither is there a fundamental core to reality; rather, reality consists of systems of interacting objects. Such concepts of reality cannot be reconciled with the substantial, subjective, holistic or instrumentalistic concepts of reality that underlie modern modes of thought.\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna's concept of reality\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna was the most significant Buddhist philosopher of India. According to Etienne Lamotte he lived in the second part of the third century after Christ (Lamotte 1949 -1980, Tome III, IX). His philosophy is of great topical interest. Right to this day it determines the thinking of all the traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. We have no assured biographical knowledge about him, other than various legends that I will not enter into here. The authenticity of 13 of his works is nevertheless regarded as established by the scholastic research. The Danish scholar Ch. Lindtner was particularly concerned with the examination and translation of these 13 works (Lindtner 2002 ). N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's main work, Mulamadhyamaka-karika (MMK), is translated into German, English, French and other European languages (Kalupahana 1999 ; Garfield 1996 ). N\u0101g\u0101rjuna is the founder of the philosophical school Madhyamaka or Middle Way. The Middle Way indicates a spiritual and philosophical path that aspires to avoid extreme metaphysical concepts, particularly the concepts of substantial and subjective thinking in their various forms. In his main work (MMK), the Middle Way is described as follows: 24.18 'What arises dependently [pratityasamutpada] is pronounced to be substancelessness [sunyata]. This is nothing but a dependent concept [prajnapti]. Substancelessness [sunyata] constitutes the middle way' (chapter 24, verse 18).\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna's philosophy consists principally of two aspects. The first aspect is an exposition of a concept of reality (sunyata, pratityasamutpada), according to which fundamental reality has no firm core and does not consist of independent, substantial components but of two-body-systems - of material or immaterial bodies that reciprocally affect each other. This concept of reality is diametrically opposed to one of the key concepts of traditional Indian metaphysics: 'svabhava' or 'own being'. The second aspect is an answer to the inner contradictions of four extreme concepts of reality that are not exhaustively presented but only indicated in principle. Nevertheless, it is easy to recognize the systems of thought to which these indications relate. This is important as it is from this recognition that we can identify those aspects of our extreme metaphysical positions that make it impossible for us to recognize the nature of reality. This is not only a debate within the traditional metaphysics of India. I relate these four extreme propositions to the substantial, subjective, holistic and instrumentalist modes of thought found in the modern world. In order to effectively undermine these modes of thought, one first has to recognize them as such. Therefore, without any claim to completeness, I will give a brief outline of these four modes of thought:\nSubstantialism. Substance is something that has independent existence (Webster's New World Dictionary, New York, 1968). In Europe, substantialism is at the centre of traditional metaphysics, beginning with pre-Socratic philosophers (such as Parmenides and Heraclitus, two critics of substantial thought) through Plato, up to Immanuel Kant. According to traditional metaphysics, substance or own being is something that has independent existence, something unchangeable, eternal and existing by itself. Substance is the underlying basis for everything else, the non-material foundation of the world in which we live. Plato made a distinction between two forms of being. Particularly in the second part of his 'Parmenides' he distinguished between, on the one hand, singular objects, which exist exclusively through participation and in so far as this is the case they have no own being, and on the other hand ideas that do have an own being. Traditional metaphysics adopted this dualism from Plato. An independent own being is characterized in traditional metaphysics as something that, as an existing thing, is not dependent on anything else (Descartes), existing by itself, subsisting through itself (More), which is completely unlimited by others and free from any kind of foreign command (Spinoza), and exists of itself without anything else (Schelling). In traditional metaphysics, the highest substance was often understood as God or as a divine being. Since Kant's so called 'Copernican revolution', the primary question of philosophy is no longer to know reality, but rather to know mind or the source of perception and knowledge. For this reason the traditional metaphysics has lost ground in the modern world. In fact, the central concepts of the traditional metaphysics such as being, substance, reality, essence, and so forth, had been replaced by the reductionist modes of thought of modern sciences. Now atoms, elementary particles, energy, fields of force, laws of nature, and so on, are seen as the fundamental ground for everything else.\nSubjectivism. By subjectivist modes of thought I understand the turning of attention to the subject that resulted from the changes created by Ren\u00e9 Descartes. According to this doctrine, consciousness is that which is primarily existent, and everything else is merely content or a form or a creation of that consciousness. The high point of this kind of subjectivism is represented by the idealism of Berkeley. The ideas of Kant can be considered as a moderated subjectivism or idealism. Since Ren\u00e9 Descartes, subjectivity or self-awareness has become the fulcrum for modern philosophical thought lending evidential proof and certainty of reality. This view has been continually brought into doubt by the modern physical sciences; however, these doubts have not led to a new and complementary concept of reality but to a calamitous separation between philosophy and the modern physical sciences. It has served only to sharpen that dualism that preoccupies modern thought. According to the physicist P.C.W. Davies ( 1986 ), electrons, photons or atoms do not exist, they are nothing but models of thought.\nHolism. This is the view that an organic or integrated whole has a reality independent of and greater than the sum of its parts (Webster's Dictionary, New York, 1968). This third approach tries to avoid the calamitous either-or scheme of the first two approaches by fusing subject and object into one whole, such that there are no longer any parts but only one identity: all is one. That whole is made absolute and is mystified. It becomes an independent unity that exists without dependence on its parts. Wholeness is understood as something concrete, as if it were an object of experience. As a philosophical approach found in great periods of European history of philosophy, this view is connected with names like Thomas Aquinas, Leibniz, Schelling. In quantum physics, holism is represented by David Bohm. 1\nInstrumentalism. The fourth approach consists of refuting or ignoring the existence of subject and object. Instead of favouring either one or the other or the two together, this metaphysical approach refutes them both. The search for reality is according to this viewpoint insignificant or meaningless. Instrumentalism is very modern, intelligent (e.g., in the person of Ernst Cassirer), and sometimes somewhat captious. It is difficult to disengage from it. As an extension of subjectivism it consists of regarding thinking as thinking in models, which is regarded as a working with information without concern as to what phenomena the information is about. It inherits this problem from subjectivism, about which the philosopher Donald Davidson wrote: 'Once one makes the decision for the Cartesian approach, it seems that one is unable to indicate what ones proofs are evidence for' (1988, 90). Instrumentalism is a collective term that denotes a variety of scientific approaches. They have the common feature of considering the totality of human knowledge, including scientific constructs, statements and theories, as not at all or sometimes merely not primarily, realistic reproductions of the structure of reality. Rather it considers them to be the result of humans' interactions with nature for the purpose of establishing theoretically and practically successful models. For instrumentalism theories are not a description of the world but are an instrument for a systematic classification and explanation of observations and for the predictions of facts. The instrumentalist approach is outlined by the experimental physicist Anton Zeilinger. Zeilinger stated in an interview: 'In classical physics we speak of a world of things that exists somewhere outside and we describe their nature. In quantum physics we have learned that we have to be very careful about this. Ultimately physical sciences are not sciences of nature but sciences of statements about nature. Nature in itself is always a construction of mind. Niels Bohr once put it like this: There is no world of quantum, there is only a quantum mechanical desciption'. 2\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna presents these four extreme concepts of reality in a scheme that is in Sanskrit called catuskoti and in Greek tetralemma. In a short form they can be expressed as follows - Things do not arise substantially: 1. either out of themselves, 2. nor out of something else, 3. nor out of both, 4. nor without a cause. Behind this scheme there are, as mentioned before, four concepts of reality that can be related to substantial, subjective, holistic and instrumentalist modes of thought in the modern world. It would be difficult to find a modern person who does not, in his own way, hold one of these four extreme views. This shows that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's philosophy is very up to date. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna did not (1) refute the substantial modes of thought in order to end up in (2) subjectivism, even though this is often claimed against him. Nor did he refute the either-or mode of thought in order to end with a view of (3) holism, identity, or wholeness, which some benevolent interpreters say of him. Nor did he refute holism in order to end up at (4) instrumentalism, as is believed by many modern interpreters in imitation of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna does not fall into any of these extremes because these are the exact four extreme metaphysical concepts that he systematically refutes.\nAlready in the very first verse of the MMK, he points out not only the dilemma but the whole tetralemma of our thinking. That verse states: 'Neither from itself nor from another, nor from both, nor without a cause does anything whatever anywhere arises' (Garfield's translation). This verse can be understood as the principal statement of the MMK: the refutation of the four extreme metaphysical views, which cannot be reconciled with the dependent arising of things. If this is the case, the remainder of the MMK would be merely a clarification of this first verse. Therefore this requires careful examination. What is the assertion made by this verse? That nothing can be found; that there is nothing; that nothing exists? Was N\u0101g\u0101rjuna denying the external world? Did he wish to refute that which evidently is? Did he want to call into question the world in which we live? Did he wish to deny the presence everywhere of things that somehow arise? If by 'arise' we understand the notion of the empirical arising of things, then we are obliged to argue that if a thing does not arise out of itself, it must arise out of something else. So we should ask: what is the significance of the concept 'to arise'?\nIn another text, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna himself gives some indication of how to understand this concept. He writes in his work Yuktisastika: '19. That which has arisen dependently on this and that that has not arisen substantially [svabhavatah]. What has not arisen substantially, how can it literally [nama] be called \"arisen\"?'. 'That which originates due to a cause and does not abide without [certain] conditions but disappears when the conditions are absent, how can it be understood as \"to exist\"?' (Lindtner 2002 , 109, 113). By the concepts of 'arising' and 'exist' N\u0101g\u0101rjuna does not mean the empirical but the substantial arising or existence. When in many other passages of the MMK N\u0101g\u0101rjuna states that things do not arise (MMK 7.29), they do not exist (MMK 3.7, MMK 5.8, MMK 14.6), they are not to be found (MMK 2.25, MMK 9.11), they are not (MMK 15.10), they are unreal (MMK 13.1), then clearly this has the meaning: Things do not arise substantially, they do not exist out of themselves, their independence cannot be found, they are dependent and in this sense they are substantially unreal. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna only refutes the idea of a substantial arising of things, of an absolute and independent existence. He does not refute the empirical existence of things. This is what he is explaining when he states: 'MMK 15.10 \"It exists\" implies grasping after eternity. \"It does not exist\" implies the philosophy of annihilation. Therefore, a discerning person should not decide on either existence or non-existence'. For N\u0101g\u0101rjuna the expression 'to exist' has the meaning 'to exist substantially'. His issue is not the empirical existence of things, but the idea of a permanent thing and of things having a substance. Only the idea of an own being, without dependence to something else, is refuted by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. Things do not arise out of themselves, they do not exist absolutely, their permanent being is not to be found, they are not independent but they are dependently arising.\nThe many interpretations of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna that claim that he is also refuting the empirical existence of objects are making an inadmissible generalization that suggests N\u0101g\u0101rjuna approaches subjectivism or instrumentalism. Such interpretations originate in metaphysical approaches that themselves have a difficulty in recognizing the empirical existence of the presenting data, which is not at all the case with N\u0101g\u0101rjuna.\nHow does N\u0101g\u0101rjuna present the dependence of phenomena? The starting point of the MMK is the double nature of phenomena. These fundamental two-body systems cannot be further analytically divided. The two bodies constitute a system of two material or immaterial components that complement each other. One of the components cannot exist without the other one; each forms the counterpart of the other. In the MMK, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna concerns himself with such concrete two-body systems as: a thing and its conditions, a walking person and the way to be walked, seer and seen, cause and effect, an entity and its characteristics, a passion and a passionate person, arising and conditions of arising, agent and action, fire and fuel. Some examples of this dependence of the two parts are discussed below.\nIn this way we are led into the centre of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's philosophy. In the first 10 chapters, and some subsequent chapters, of MMK, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna emphasizes one central idea: material or immaterial bodies of two-body systems are not identical nor can they be separated. The most important characteristic of phenomena is their interdependence and the resultant - substancelessness: the impossibility of existing individually or independently. This is the meaning of sunyata: phenomena are without own being and without independence. Reality does not consist of single, isolated material or immaterial components; phenomena arise only in dependence on other phenomena. They do not arise substantially because dependent phenomena can have no independent existence.\nA thing is not independent of its conditions, nor is it identical with them. Walking does not exist without the way to be walked. The walking person and the way are not one. A seer is not the same as the seen object, but a seer without an object does not exist. There can be no cause without an effect, or an affect without a cause. The concept 'cause' has no meaning without the concept 'effect'. Cause and effect are not one, but they cannot be separated into two independent concepts. Without a characteristic we cannot speak of a characterized, or of a characterized without a characteristic. How could there be a passionate person without passion? When there are no conditions of arising there is no arising, neither exists standing alone. Without action there can be no agent; without fire there can be nothing designated as fuel.\nThe material or immaterial components of a two-body system do not exist in isolation, they are not one and yet they are not independent of each other: and because of this they are not 'real'. For two complementary phenomena or for double concepts, the nature and the existence of each are dependent on the other. The one arises with the other and disappears with the other. This is why a thing arises substantially, neither out of itself, nor out of another one, nor out of both, nor without a cause. There is no fundamental core to reality; rather, reality consists of systems of interacting bodies.\nThis concept of reality is initially merely an idea; a pointer to the reality that cannot be described in words. One who can speak about concept-free reality has not experienced it. For the Buddhist tradition based on N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, the yogic experience of substancelessness, the ascertainment of dependent arising, the direct perception of reality as it is, all presuppose a high level of a spiritual realization that entails the abandonment of extreme views and the dissolution of the whole edifice of dualistic thought. To experience sunyata or the substancelessness of phenomena means to become free of all entanglements to this world. Nirvana is simply another expression for this.\nInterpretations\nFor N\u0101g\u0101rjuna the primary question was not about mind, nor about the origin of knowledge, but about reality. Such subjective interest applies more readily to the Yogacara School and the philosophical base of tantric Buddhism. But the interpretations of the most important work of Yogacara are controversial because they can be understood in an ontological sense that is denying the external world and is adopting the view of idealism or in an epistemic sense for the study of the nature of knowledge where perception is a projection of mind. What in Yogacara is termed 'alayavijna' or the fundamental mind, or in tantric Buddhism 'clear light' or 'Mahamudra', refers to the knowledge of reality. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's philosophy is referring to sunyata itself. In 2003 Tarab Tulku Rinpoche presented an all encompassing position. He says 'that everything existing partakes in a fundamental \"mind-field\", which is the basic \"substance\" from which basis mind in a more individual way and the individual body develop' (Tarab Tulku Rinpoche, 2006 ; see also Keown 2003 ; Rabten 2002 , 255).\nIn order to emphasize that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna does not speak only about concepts without substance but also about objects without substance, I compare his concept of reality with the concept of reality suggested by quantum physics. Physics is not only about concepts but also about the conditions of physical reality. Undoubtedly physics only creates models, and thus examines only realities that had been posited by physics itself. Nevertheless, we should not go so far as to consider all our perceptions and thought models to be purely adventitious. While the constructions of our mind are not directly identical with reality, they are not purely coincidental and normally they are not deceptive (Rock 1995 ). Behind these models are empirical objects and there is some approximation of a structural similarity between a good physical model and the corresponding physical reality.\nMetaphysical foundations of quantum physics\nThis is not a presentation or criticism of quantum physics but a discussion of the metaphysical mindsets and principles that underlie quantum physics. The concept of reality in quantum physics can be expressed by the key words 'complementarity', 'four interactions' and 'entanglements'. (Entanglements will not be explained in this short paper. According to Roger Penrose, 'quantum entanglement is a very strange type of thing. It is somewhere between objects being separate and being in communication with each other' (2000, 66).)\nIn the long prehistory of quantum physics it could not be proved experimentally whether the smallest elements of light were particles or waves. Many experiments argued in favour of one or the other assumption. Electrons and photons sometimes act like waves and sometimes like particles. This 'behaviour' was named a wave-particle dualism. The idea of dualism was therein understood as a logical contradiction, in that only one or the other could actually apply; but paradoxically both appeared. According to this understanding electrons and photons cannot be both particles and waves. This is the understanding according to atomism. According to atomism, a scientific explanation consists of a reduction of a variable object into its permanent components or mathematical laws that apply to it. This is the fundamental dualistic concept that modern atomism has adopted from the natural philosophy of the ancient Greeks: according to this, substance and permanence cannot be found in objects of perception of the world in which we live, but can be found in the elementary elements making up objects and the mathematical order applying to them. These material and immaterial foundations hold the world together, they do not change, although everything else changes.\nAccording to the expectation of atomism it should be possible to reduce an object to its independent elements or to its mathematical laws or to its simple and fundamental principles, and according to these the fundamental elements must be either particles or waves, not both.\nWhat is to be understood by independent elements? As I have mentioned before, Plato made a distinction between two forms of being. Particularly in the second part of his 'Parmenides' he distinguished between, on the one hand, singular objects, which exist exclusively through participation and in so far as this is the case they have no own being, and on the other hand ideas that do have an own being. Traditional metaphysics adopted this dualism from Plato. An independent own being is characterized in traditional metaphysics as something that, as an existing thing, is not dependent on anything else (Descartes), existing by itself, subsisting through itself (More), which is completely unlimited by others and free from any kind of foreign command (Spinoza), and exists of itself without anything else (Schelling). Albert Einstein ( 1948 ) was following this metaphysical tradition when he wrote 'For the classification of things that are introduced in physics, it is essential that these things have for a certain time an independent existence, in so far as these things lie \"in different parts of space\". Without the assumption of such an independent existence [So-sein, suchness] of things which, in terms of ordinary thought are spatially distant from each other, physical thought in the usual sense would not be possible'.\nThis idea of an independent reality was projected on to the basic element of the world of matter by atomism. For atomism, a scientific explanation means to reduce the variability and variety of objects and conditions to their permanent, stable, independent, indivisible elements or to their conformity with mathematical laws. According to the expectations of atomism, all variations in nature can be explained in terms of separation, association and movements of unchanging, independent atoms or still more elementary particles. These particles and their conformity to mathematical laws constitute the core of things, underlie everything and hold the world together. The question of whether the fundamental objects are waves or particles was an explosive issue: at stake were the traditional metaphysical concepts of reality available to quantum physics. It became evident that the fundamental reality could not be grasped by traditional concepts of reality. What is the explanatory worth of atomism if it becomes clear that there are no independent, stable atoms or elementary particles and that objects have no stable core? Were these quantum objects objective, subjective, both, or neither? What is reality? Is the quantum world distinct from the world in which we are living?\nNiels Bohr\nIn 1927, the physicist Niels Bohr introduced the concept of complementarity into quantum physics. According to this concept the wave form and the particle form are not two separate forms that contradict and exclude each other, but are mutually complementary forms that only together can provide a complete description of physical manifestations. According to Bohr, complementarity meant that in the quantum world it is impossible to speak about independent quantum objects because they are in an interactive relationship with each other, as well as with the instrument of measurement. Bohr emphasized that this interaction between the quantum object and the instrument of measurement was an inseparable element of quantum objects, because it plays a major part in the development of several features of quantum objects. Certain measurements establish electrons or photons as particles and destroy the interference that distinguishes the object as a wave. Other measurements establish the object as a wave. This was Bohr's new concept of reality. From the insight that the quantum object and the instrument of measurement could not be separated, Bohr did not conclude that there are no quantum objects. At least he did not do so when he was arguing in terms of physics. When he spoke about the metaphysics of quantum physics he sometimes took an instrumentalist approach. 3 For Niels Bohr the fundamental physical reality consists of interacting and complementary quantum objects.\nInteraction in the standard model of quantum physics\nIn the meantime the concept of the four interactions was introduced into the standard model of quantum physics. These four elementary interactions or four forces obstruct the reduction of quantum objects into independent objects - as Democritus had suggested. The interactions, the forces that operate between the quantum objects, are added to the quantum objects. Instead of singular, independent objects, two-body systems or many-body systems were established as the base of matter. Between the bodies, interacting forces are effective in keeping the bodies together. 4 These interactions are a composite of the bodies. Mostly they are forces of attraction, and in the case of electro-magnetic forces they can also be forces of repulsion. One visualizes the interaction between the elementary particles as an interchange of elementary particles. The physicist Steven Weinberg writes about this:\nAt the present moment the closest we can come to a unified view of nature is a description in terms of elementary particles and their mutual interactions [\n] The most familiar are gravitation and electromagnetism, which, because of their long range, are experienced in the everyday world. Gravity holds our feet on the ground and the planets in their orbits. Electromagnetic interactions of electrons and atomic nuclei are responsible for all the familiar chemical and physical properties of ordinary solids, liquids and gases. Next, both in range and familiarity, are the 'strong' interactions, which hold protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus. The strong forces are limited in range to about 10-\u00a013 centimeter and so are quite insignificant in ordinary life, or even in the scale (10-\u00a08 centimeter) of the atom. Least familiar are the 'weak' interactions. They are of such short range (less than 10-\u00a015 centimeter) and are so weak that they do not seem to play a r\u00f4le in holding anything together. (1974, 50)\nIn this respect the explanations enter into very difficult and subtle particulars. How, for example, can an electron that consists only of one particle have an interaction with another quantum object? What part of itself can it emit if it consists only of one particle? This question can be answered by the concept of interactions. In fact, an electron does not exist of only a single particle exactly because the interaction of the electron is a part of it. In an article from 1978 about super-gravitation the two physicists Daniel Z. Freedman and Pieter von Nieuwenhuizen wrote about it as follows: 'The observed electron mass is the sum of the \"bare mass\" and the \"self-energy\" resulting from the interaction of the electron with its own electromagnetic field. Only the sum of the two terms is observable' (Friedman and Niuwenhuizen 1978 , 132).\nWhat quantum physics knows about interactions is here summarized in the words of the physicist Gerhard 't Hooft, who writes: 'An electron is surrounded by a cloud of virtual particles, which it continually emits and absorbs. This cloud does not consist of photons only, but also of pairs of charged particles, for example electrons and their anti-particles, the positrons' [\n] 'Even a quark is surrounded by a cloud of gluons and pairs of quark and anti-quark' (t'Hooft 1995 , 42, 46).\nSingular, isolated, independent quarks have never been observed. In the new research this phenomenon is called 'confinement'. This means quarks are captives, they cannot appear as a single quark but only as one of a pair or as one of a trio. When you try to separate two quarks by force, there will appear new quarks between them, which combine into pairs and trios. Claudio Rebbi and other physicists have reported: 'Between the quarks and gluons inside an elementary particle, additional quarks and gluons are continuously formed and after a short time again subside'. 5 These clouds of virtual particles represent or produce interactions.\nWe now arrived at the central core of quantum physics. It consists of a new concept of reality, which no longer perceives singular, independent elements as the fundamental unit of reality, but rather two-body systems or two states of a quantum object or two concepts - such as earth and moon, proton and electron, proton and neutron, quark and anti-quark, wave and measuring instrument, particle and measuring instrument, twin photons, superpositions, spin up and spin down, matter and anti-matter, elementary particle and field of force, low of nature and matter, symmetry and anti-symmetry, and so on. These systems cannot be separated into independent parts. They cannot be reduced to two separate, independent bodies or states, nor is one fundamental and the other derived as the metaphysical either-or scheme that substantialism or subjectivism usually try to establish. Nor are they joined into a seamless unity; they are not the same, they are not identical, they are not a mysterious wholeness as holism indicates. Nor can one claim that they are nothing but mathematical models that we have constructed and that do not correspond to physical reality, as instrumentalism claims.\nIn physics there is a fundamental reality that is not a one-body system but a two-body system or an assembly of bodies, a cloud of virtual particles, which surround the central or the 'naked' body. Between these bodies there is an interaction that is one of the composite of these bodies. This understanding of physics cannot be dislodged and yet all our metaphysical schemata struggle against it. This cloud does not conform to our traditional metaphysical expectations of that which should delineate and underpin stability, substantiality and order. How can clouds be what we are used to calling the basic elements of matter? How can this small vibrating something be what generations of philosophers and physicists have been searching for in order to arrive at the core of matter or at the ultimate reality? Is this supposed to be it? From these little clouds we attempt to use metaphysical interpretation to distil something that has substance and that endures. Entirely within the sense of the substance metaphysics of Plato, Werner Heisenberg said that the mathematical forms are the idea of elementary particles and that the object of elementary particles is corresponding to this mathematical idea. Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker called mathematics 'the essence of nature'. According to the physicist Herwig Schopper, fields of force are the ultimate reality. 6 Some of us want to see reality as a mysterious whole (holism), or dismiss them as a construction without any correspondence to empirical reality (instrumentalism). All of this only because we do not find it easy to admit that the complex interactions of the world in which we live have their roots in a reality that is itself a complex reality. It is impossible to escape from the entanglement of this world by quantum physics. It is impossible to find an elementary quantum object that is not dependent on other quantum objects or dependent on parts of itself. It is impossible to dissolve the double-sided character of quantum objects. The fundamental reality of our physical world consists of clouds of interacting quantum objects.\nResults\nReality is not static, solid or independent. It does not consist of singular, isolated material or immaterial factors, but of systems of dependent bodies. (I use the expression 'body' synonymously like 'quantum object' or 'particle' or 'field' or 'system' or 'entity'. There is just a small difference between these expressions that can be neglected.) The systems mostly consist of more than two components, but there are no systems that consist of less than two components. In quantum physics we call such fundamental two-body systems earth and moon, electron and positron, quark and anti-quark, elementary particle and field of force. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna calls his systems or dependent pairs walking person and way to be walked, fire and fuel, agent and action, seer and object of seeing. Both of these models describe two-body systems or two entities that have bodies neither properly separate nor properly joined together. They do not fall into one, nor do they fall apart. These bodies are not independent and they cannot be observed singly because in their very existence and constitution they are dependent on each other and cannot exist or function independently of each other. They are entangled by interactions, even in a far distance. One of them cannot be reduced to the other; it is not possible to explain one of them on the basis of the other. The resultant systems have a fragile stability, the components of which are maintained by interactions and mutual dependencies that are sometimes known, sometimes not fully known and sometimes, as with entangled twin photons for example, totally unknown.\nWhat is reality? We have become accustomed to firm ground beneath our feet and fleeting clouds in the sky. The concept of reality of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's philosophy and the concepts of complementarity and interactions of quantum physics teach us something quite different that one could express metaphorically: everything is built on sand, and not even the grains of sand have a solid core or nucleus. Their stability is based on the unstable interactions of their component parts.\nNotes\n1. See Bohm ( 2000 ). Bohm's key word that expresses his holism is 'holomovement'.\n2. Anton Zeilinger, interview at the German newspaper Tagesspiegel, 20 December 1999. Steven Hawkings is defending a very similar position. He says: 'I, on the other hand, am a positivist who believes that physical theories are just mathematical models we construct, and that it is meaningless to ask if they correspond to reality, just whether they predict observations' (Stephen Hawkings in Penrose 2000 , 169). It is not meaningless to ask about the correspondence between a model and object, because if a model is correct then it has structural similarities with the phenomena that it is reconstructing; otherwise it can lead to predictions for which there are no meaningful physical explanations, because they have no correspondence to experimental data. See also Fraassen ( 1980 , 1989 ).\n3. Bohr ( 1985 , 103): 'I do not know what quantum mechanic is. I think we are dealing with some mathematical methods which are adequate for description of our experiments' [1927].\n4. 'The most convenient context for investigating the forces of nature is a system of two objects bound together by mutual attraction. The earth and the moon, for example, constitute the most readily accessible system in which to observe the gravitational force. The hydrogen atom, consisting of an electron and a proton, has long been an essential testing ground for theories of the electromagnetic force. The deuterion, made up of a proton and a neutron, represents a model system for studies of the forces in the atomic nucleus. Now there is a bound system in which to investigate the force that acts between quarks, the constituents of protons, neutrons and many related particles. The system is called quarkonium, and it consists of a heavy quark bound to an equally massiv antiquark. The force at work in quarkonium is the strongest one known; it has come to be called the color force, and it is now thought to be the basis of all nuclear forces. Of the various two-body systems the simplest in some respects is the artificial atom called positronium' (Bloom and Feldman 1982 , 42).\n5.

Why is it more complicated than a regular computer? As a scientist in this field myself, I can\u2019t help but feel bad about the confusion surrounding this topic. People are really just curious about the potential of this cool sounding technology, and although news reports continue to promise the appearance of these machines very soon, the exact definition of a quantum computer still seems to be elusive.\nI\u2019m going to try and explain one of the main problems in the field of quantum computing today through the use of a visual analogy. The following explanation gets to the heart of a real disagreement, even between experts in the field. There are heated debates in the scientific community over this problem (yes, scientists get into dogfights too). So be aware that you\u2019re getting some juicy inside knowledge here about what really stumps even expert scientists! Of course we don\u2019t often want to shout about the fact that we get stumped by things\u2026 but it is true\nI should mention that this explanation is a very conceptual and abstract way to look at quantum computing so there won\u2019t be any implementations or specific algorithms discussed. It compares the \u2018conventional\u2019 approach of quantum computing with a new approach, called \u2018Natural Quantum Computing\u2019 (NQC). The quantum computers built by D-Wave are of the NQC type.\n.\nBuilding blocks \u2013 in theory and in practice\nLet\u2019s begin with some background. When engineers and scientists build a new technology, there are two factors that come into play. There\u2019s the theoretical model of the technology or system, and then there\u2019s the practical implementation of that technology or system. These two companions are like yin and yang, both are necessary for the whole to function, yet they are forever competing with one another, two sides of the same coin.\nIn my analogy, my yin and yang are going to be represented by circles:\n.\n.\nWhich circle is better? You might argue that the perfect yin circle is mathematically more beautiful, but if it is never found in nature, then is it really of any use to us? The more natural yang circle has its own bumpy beauty in that it really represents the true nature of what we see around us. You just don\u2019t see perfect circles in nature.\nNow, what does this have to do with computing? Well, when we want to build a system, we build it out of bumpy circles (we have to, as they are the only things we can find around us). But we understand it \u2013 and predict how it will behave mathematically \u2013 by approximating it with perfect circles, because those are easier for us to calculate with. So, let\u2019s pretend that our circles are now building blocks:\n.\n.\nIn most cases, this works pretty well. Our mathematical models now predict the behaviour of the circles pretty much the same way as they behave in nature (if you\u2019d like to think about this system \u2018behaving\u2019 dynamically, imagine removing one of the circles on the lower layer and trying to predict where they would all end up). Our model of the circles would probably get it roughly right.\nWhen we try to understand classical digital circuits, the same thing happens. We build a \u2018model\u2019 of a classical digital computer, like the picture above, and that model behaves in a similar way to its real-world counterpart.\n.\nBuilding a \u2018conventional\u2019 Quantum Computer using circles\nHowever, (and here begins the juicy bit) \u2013 quantum computers don\u2019t work like that. At least, not the ones that people have been trying to build up to now. I\u2019m going to use the phrase \u2018conventional QC\u2019 to describe those, because there IS a different way of doing things which I\u2019ll describe later. It turns out that in a conventional QC that slight difference between the yin and yang descriptions really does make ALL the difference.\nWhat would a conventional quantum computer look like if we used the circle analogy to describe it? Well our mathematical yin model of it would probably look something like this:\n.\n.\nWhat happens when you try and build this model using real, bumpy, yang circles? Well, you can try\u2026\n.\n.\nOops! What happened? It didn\u2019t work like we thought it would. The imperfections in the circles just made our delicate system come crashing down. Try again? The same thing happens. You can never get those circles to behave like their yin counterparts. The bumpiness just makes it impossible.\nThis is exactly what happens when we try to build a quantum computer. Our theories tell us that if we can just get 50, or 100, or maybe 500 of those darned circles to balance on top of one another then our technology will be able to fulfil our every dream! But we just can\u2019t do it in real life \u2013 the thing keeps falling over! That is exactly what is meant by a system undergoing \u2018decoherence\u2019 if you are familiar with quantum computing parlance.\nWell, something has to be done about this. We still want to be able to build a quantum computing system, right?\nYes \u2013 but there is an important problem to be addressed here. Who is at fault? Something didn\u2019t add up, and blame must be assigned! Most people blame the yang engineers of the system for using bumpy circles: \u201cYour circles are not perfect enough. Your system falls over. You\u2019re not trying hard enough.\u201d\nSo the diligent engineers try to find ways to make their circles more and more smooth. Little by little, they are able to balance one or two more on top of each other, for a little longer. But the circles can never be exactly perfect \u2013 so although that mathematically stable equilibrium of hundreds of balanced circles can be easily be modelled in theory, it is questionable as to whether it can it ever be built.\nThe interesting thing is that the question is almost never asked the other way round:\nAre the yin circles perhaps too perfect?\nIn other words: Why do we create models of things that we then can\u2019t ever practically make for real? All approximate models break down at some point, but the difference is usually small enough to still be able to inform our practical building of things. But in this case the model seems useless for anything we try to build that is more complex than a few building blocks!\n.\nNatural Quantum Computation\nThere is another way to build quantum computers that DO behave like their models. There is a type of quantum computing known as Natural Quantum Computing (NQC). This is a way of using quantum systems that we CAN build, in a way that is practical, and doesn\u2019t go against what nature intended to happen to those circles.\nA natural quantum computer system would be represented more like this:\n.\n.\nNow the bumpiness doesn\u2019t matter as much, because once again our model behaves a lot more like the real thing we are building. We have attacked the problem from both sides here \u2013 we have taken a reality check on our expectations of building with bumpy circles, and we have designed a mathematical model that respects that. We can still build up our quantum computer to be bigger and bigger using this method, and to do more and more, but it now captures the essence of how nature\u2019s elements really do behave. Now this should answer the question about why different people have built quantum computers with different numbers of \u2018qubits\u2019 (quantum bits) \u2013 try and balance them using the conventional approach, and it depends how well you smooth out your bumpy circles. You might be able to get four, five, or even seven wobbling precariously on top of one another. People are working all over the world on trying to improve what nature has given to us, to get those circles smoother and smoother.\nBut using Natural QC and you can easily build systems with hundreds of bits. The system works differently, and it doesn\u2019t fall over so much!\n.\nSo why isn\u2019t everyone taking this Natural QC approach?\nSome people feel that it is better to just keep trying to make the circles ever smoother, because people are very familiar with the theoretical \u2018yin model\u2019 and have worked with this system mathematically for many years, developing algorithms to allow such a system (once built) to solve problems very quickly. But natural quantum computing is also very good at solving specific types of problems, like those in artificial intelligence and optimization. I myself feel that these NQC-suited problems are more interesting. Given that we also know that it is much easier to build these natural quantum computers, for me it\u2019s really a no-brainer! But some people still like the idea of building the precariously-balancing conventional type of quantum computer. And it\u2019s a matter of opinion about whether or not you believe that it is possible to make those circles smooth enough to get them to balance. But that\u2019s half the fun in science \u2013 there are some questions that just haven\u2019t been answered yet!\nEven so, I think that we are sometimes a little too biased towards the yin theoretical description of a perfect system, hypnotized by the beauty and simplicity of our mathematical models. And we become disheartened and frustrated when real systems don\u2019t behave like this. But this is not necessarily a problem with nature; it can also be thought of as a problem with our models! Sure, we can make nature behave more like our models by polishing those bumpy circles. But we can also make our models behave more like nature too. We can meet half way, and have the best of both worlds. And personally I\u2019d rather build problem solving things (and models of them!) with natural bumpiness than spend my entire life trying to polish circles to an unachievable smoothness.\n"}, {"score": 2788.589, "uuid": "095d4ec6-57e9-522e-b409-76092797140c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700wb-41-09284", "target_hostname": "www.spaceandmotion.com", "target_uri": "http://www.spaceandmotion.com/quantum-mechanics-richard-feynman-quotes.htm", "page_rank": 1.2457102e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "<em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>: Richard Feynman", "snippet": "<em>The</em> only <em>difference</em> <em>is</em> that <em>the</em> angels sit in a different direction <em>and</em> their wings push inward.

Klemm and William H. Klink\nAbstract. We present a model of a fundamental property of consciousness as the capacity of a system to opt among presented alternatives. Any system possessing this capacity is \u0093conscious\u0094 in some degree, whether or not it has the higher capacity of reflecting on its opting. We argue that quantum systems, composed of microphysical particles, as studied by quantum mechanics, possess this quality in a protomental form. That is, such particles display the capacity to opt among alternatives, even though they lack the ability to experience or communicate their experiences. Human consciousness stands at the opposite end of the hierarchy of conscious life forms as the most sophisticated system of which we have direct acquaintance. We contend that it shares the common characteristic of a system capable of opting among alternatives. Because the fundamental property of consciousness is shared by human beings and the constituents of elementary matter in the universe, our model of consciousness can be considered as a modified form of panpsychism.\nKeywords: freedom; hierarchy of matter; models of consciousness; opting from alternatives; panpsychism; quantum mechanics; Sartre and spontaneity; subjectivity\nIn its widest connotation, consciousness \u0093includes all experiences\u0094 (Husserl 1976, 113). To be conscious of something means to be immediately aware of it, in the sense of having direct acquaintance with it in one\u0092s own mind. Consciousness has a qualitative dimension, because immediate awareness involves more than passive reception of sensory data. Consciousness is active in its meaning-giving and meaning-receiving functions. In directing its \u0093mental look\u0094 toward selected contents, which are uniquely \u0093appreciated\u0094 or \u0093valued\u0094 in their actuality, consciousness makes choices among possible alternatives (Husserl 1976, 117, 122\u009623). Consciousness also has a subjective dimension, because in becoming conscious of something I also am immediately aware that this act is \u0093mine,\u0094 that \u0093I\u0094 am conscious of it.\nIn this essay we propose a model for a fundamental property of consciousness that can account for what David Chalmers has called the \u0093hard problem\u0094 of consciousness, namely, the twofold problem of what consciousness is\u0097its essential nature\u0097and how it came to be (Chalmers 1997, 1).1 On the first issue, we argue that the fundamental property of consciousness is the capacity of a system to opt among alternatives, such that the outcomes are neither determined (wholly predictable) nor random (although they may be given by probabilities). The capacity to opt among alternatives is presupposed by the meaning-giving, meaning-receiving function of consciousness, because every meaning in consciousness is the actualization of one potentiality among many. On the second issue, we claim that the fundamental property of consciousness is ingredient in elementary physical particles, the basic constituents of matter, from the beginning. Consequently, our model opens the possibility of explaining the origins of consciousness as the organic development of a potentiality already found in the deepest structure of matter. Moreover, our model points toward a way that avoids the opposition between ontological dualism and all forms of materialism or naturalism. Indeed, our model implies a modified form of panpsychism, one based on scientific rather than on metaphysical grounds (contra Griffin 1998, for example).\nOur philosophical orientation in this essay is to modern European thought in the traditions of phenomenology that run from Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and G. W. F. Hegel, through Edmund Husserl and his immediate followers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricoeur, Emmanuel Levinas, and others. This broad tradition has defined itself as a study of consciousness in its peculiarly human manifestation as self-consciousness. The reason for this focus on consciousness is, as contemporary German philosopher Manfred Frank said in a 1994 lecture, that \u0093modern thinkers again and again held self-consciousness to be an indubitable principle. It counted as the fundamentum inconcussu from which intelligibility one hoped to be able to deduce all other insights, step by step.\u0094 In other words, modern European philosophy has grounded itself on the self-evident givenness of consciousness, which, as Descartes demonstrated, cannot be denied without being affirmed. In this tradition, consciousness is the meaning-constituting element in any possible experience or knowledge of the objective world and so should be the first topic of philosophical inquiry. Phenomenology is the philosophical effort to reflect rigorously on the first-person experiences of conscious states for the purpose of attending to phenomena in their modes of givenness. Its central question is: How does consciousness constitute objectivity by, in, and for consciousness?\nContravening this major tradition is the modern scientific view of the purely material universe, which operates strictly according to principles derived through induction from empirical observation. The modern scientific view has no need for either universal mentalism or dualism in philosophy.2 Its explanations of phenomena (and all phenomena are, according to modern science, in principle physical phenomena) are entirely naturalistic. Consider Newtonian mechanics, through which the modern scientific view of the universe became compelling and dominant in the Western tradition, rendering the Cartesian line of thought an idiosyncratic branch of speculative philosophy that scientists can well ignore. In their initial reception, the principles of Newtonian mechanics seemed utterly universal and necessary. Their many successes raised the question: Do Newtonian principles exhaustively explain all of reality, including mental reality? If so, phenomenology and its domain\u0097the first-person experience of conscious states\u0097lose their viability. Instead, the prospect looms of a deterministic, utterly material universe, completely knowable and predictable by science.\nWe argue the contrary. In our view, consciousness in its subjective dimension remains an anomaly for the materialistic view of the world, even with the advent of neuroscience. Even if the scientific program that began with Newtonian mechanics could successfully be applied to such conscious activities as thinking and perceiving, reducing them to neuronal mechanisms, the felt experiences or qualia of thinking and perceiving would be left unexplained (see Chalmers 1997, 10). The reason for the inexplicability of experience is that the I of a conscious individual\u0097the one who experiences sensations, emotions, thoughts, and the like\u0097necessarily escapes scientific analysis, because the immediacy of first-person experience is not a sensibly observable object, even in the form of a neural process, but an \u0093inner life\u0094 that accompanies these other activities of consciousness. This inner life is constituted by an awareness of \u0093what it is like to be\u0094 a conscious organism (Nagel 1974). It is an immediate consciousness that \u0093I\u0094 have of how it is with me. Any attempt to objectify my inner life misses the phenomenon, which recedes behind the effort to objectify it and thus systematically eludes objectification. Given this situation, we are left with the \u0093hard problem\u0094 (Chalmers 1997, 11): \u0093Why should physical processing give rise to a rich inner life at all?\u0094 The materialistic program seems incapable of resolving this anomaly of subjectivity.\nBefore continuing, let us clarify what we mean by the latter term. Subjectivity means the principle of the individualized origin point and owner of experiences as \u0093mine.\u0094 Every individual who says \u0093I\u0094 uniquely reveals the phenomenon of subjectivity. Using Kant\u0092s terminology (1965, 329, 167\u009671), we say that subjectivity has both empirical and transcendental dimensions. The empirical subject is the immediate subject of first-order empirical experiences, in which \u0093I\u0094 relate to things, other persons, my own mental states, or even reflective objects such as truth, goodness, or beauty. The transcendental subject is the subjective principle of the unity of consciousness over time in relating to its own first-order experiences. The transcendental I relates not to first-order things, persons, and so forth but rather as a second-order possibility to its own relations to things (for example, as theoretical, practical, or aesthetic relations). It is the condition of the possibility of unifying diverse conscious experiences into a continuous narrative account that is \u0093mine.\u0094\nFrank makes the point that subjectivity resists materialistic reductions of all kinds. He cited the linguistic example of the subjective use of the first-person pronoun I. When used, the indexical I necessarily discloses its referential object (me, myself, as subject), yet the reached I is not a possible object of scientific inquiry but the subject of any such activities as scientific inquiry. Frank\u0092s general claim is that the subjective perspective, the inner experience of the I, is irreplaceably necessary for any situating of the self in the world as origin point of practical interactions with the world. I would not know how meaningfully to use the indexical I apart from my own inner acquaintance with myself as the one denoted by the first-person pronoun. According to Frank, the materialist cannot even mount a refutation of the ontological irreducibility of subjectivity without situating herself in the world as an I and assuming responsibility as an I for the refutation. The refutation of subjectivity therefore entails the assertion of subjectivity, which makes the refutation self-contradictory.\nIs the systematically elusive I necessarily immaterial? If the criterion for materiality is to be a possible object of scientific inquiry, the I as such is immaterial. Accordingly, Husserl conceives of phenomenology as \u0093a science of concrete, transcendental subjectivity\u0094 (1960, 30) that is altogether different from the naturalistic science of psychology. Psychology is an objective science in that it limits itself to \u0093worldly\u0094 subjectivity\u0097that is, subjectivity that one encounters within the world. The transcendental subject, which is \u0093phenomenology\u0092s sole theme,\u0094 is extramundane individuality in that the I is neither simply a piece of the world (the person) nor a \u0093universal subject\u0094 disembodied from the world. The transcendental subject combines these two elements: pure consciousness, which is \u0093absolute in itself,\u0094 comes into \u0093empirical relation to the body,\u0094 becoming \u0093real in a human and animal sense, and only thereby does it win a place in Nature\u0092s space and time\u0094 (Husserl 1976, 164). This interweaving of pure, transcendental consciousness with corporeal being occurs in \u0093apperception,\u0094 with a twofold point of view: The apprehending glance both turns toward perceived objects and passes back \u0093to the pure apprehending consciousness itself\u0094 (1976, 165\u009666).\nThe accomplishment of Husserl\u0092s phenomenology is to display the essential structures of consciousness for analysis. According to Husserl, consciousness has the structure of intentionality, which means that consciousness intends an object that is distinct from the activity of consciousness. Consciousness is always \u0093a consciousness of something\u0094 (1976, 120). Hence, we have on one side the intentional act and on the other side the intentional object. Intentional objects are \u0093unities of meaning\u0094 (p. 168) as \u0093modally determined\u0094 (for example, as a natural object or as an object of value) (p. 367). The important point for our argument is that for Husserl all reality exists through the conferring of meaning, and the transcendental subject is the originating source of meaning-giving consciousness (Husserl 1960, 7\u009626; 1976, 168).\nHusserlian phenomenology thereby has a solution to the \u0093hard problem\u0094 of consciousness: Mental activities, such as thinking and perceiving, do not, strictly speaking, \u0093give rise\u0094 to the elusive phenomenon of inner, conscious life; rather, both mental activities and the inner life that accompanies them (determinations of self-apperception, immediate self-consciousness) are grounded in and arise from transcendental subjectivity. There is a cost, however, for this answer. The phenomenological tradition thereby rests on the foundations of an otherworldly transcendental ego. Descartes\u0092 substance dualism, or, in an extreme interpretation, perhaps even Fichte\u0092s subjective idealism (universal mentalism) are corollaries of phenomenology. The rub for this tradition is that if transcendental subjectivity as the constituting origin of consciousness is an unnecessary theoretical construct, the phenomenological solution to the problem of consciousness evaporates.\nWe offer an alternative answer. We argue for a model of consciousness that preserves the experience of subjectivity and in this regard still stands in the tradition of phenomenology just outlined. But our model redefines subjectivity in terms of the capacity to opt among alternatives, which connects subjectivity to elemental properties of matter at the microphysical level. We speak of a minimal \u0093subjectivity of opting,\u0094 which abandons the foundational and constitutive role of the transcendental ego. The thought of Sartre\u0097himself a phenomenologist who was profoundly critical of certain elements of Husserl\u0092s classical presentation of phenomenology\u0097proves instrumental for us in this regard. As such, our model of consciousness breaks from classical phenomenological approaches by entailing neither dualism nor idealism. At the same time, by connecting to quantum mechanics through the subjective phenomenon of opting among alternatives, our model avoids all forms of materialism. As we shall explain, by virtue of its connection with quantum mechanics, our model instead implies a modified form of panpsychism, a third option in the current standoff between dualism and materialism.\nQUANTUM MECHANICS AS A THEORY OF ALTERNATIVES\nQuantum mechanics is one of the most successful physical theories ever created by human beings. Our society is dominated by devices whose structure and function is governed by quantum mechanics. Examples include almost all electronic devices that one can buy today, many devices in medical science such as PET scanners and magnetic resonance devices, and nuclear fusion and fission devices such as nuclear reactors. Were not quantum mechanics a fundamentally correct theory, these devices would not function properly. It is an incredibly successful theory, particularly in the areas of atomic, molecular, and solid state physics, where the interactions between the constituents (primarily electrons and nuclei) are electromagnetic interactions.\nStill, there are many open and puzzling questions in quantum mechanics. These have primarily to do with nuclear and gravitational interactions, whose nature is not as well understood as electromagnetic ones. They also have to do with phenomena dealing with particles whose velocities are close to the speed of light, in which case Einstein\u0092s theory of relativity must be incorporated into the quantum mechanical framework. But in the domain of what is called nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, dealing with phenomena that are mediated by the electromagnetic interactions, theory and experiment are in excellent agreement.3\nIn spite of the spectacular successes of quantum mechanics, it is very difficult to be able to say what quantum mechanics really means\u0097what it tells us about the nature and behavior of matter. Quantum mechanics is able to predict with uncanny accuracy what the observable quantities in an experiment will be and with what probabilities these observable quantities will occur, but it gives no insight as to why or how individual outcomes occur. The remarkable feature of quantum behavior is that unpredictable outcomes of individual systems between clear alternatives occur for microphysical systems, and the best that quantum mechanics can do is to predict probabilities. We propose that individual microphysical systems are making unpredictable \u0093choices\u0094 between alternatives open to them. We use the word opting to denote these acts of \u0093choosing\u0094 that are not individually predictable, even though they confirm the probabilities. Such opting at the microphysical level, we want to maintain, signifies the presence of protomental conscious life that underlies the phenomena explained by quantum theory. Thus, we are arguing for a way of understanding quantum theory that makes clear why the structure of quantum theory cannot in general deal with the behavior of individual quantum systems.\nIn this section we present arguments that quantum mechanics is a theory that specifies the alternatives that are open to a quantum system. The reason that quantum mechanics is unable to specify beyond probability why a quantum system opts for certain available outcomes is that these systems express a primitive property of consciousness, which is a fundamental aspect of the quantum world that cannot be reduced to any more basic category. In other words, quantum systems display the fundamental property that is characteristic of consciousness.\nTo spell out what this means and the implications it has for our model of consciousness, it is necessary to review some of the main tenets of quantum theory.4 We begin with the idea of the state of a system and show how it is linked to the notion of symmetry. The further consequences of symmetry lead then to the peculiarities that arise in the evolution of states using the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nQuantum mechanics begins with the notion of the state of a system\u0097 that is, the maximum amount of information available about it. Quantum mechanics is not unique in beginning with states; all physical theories begin with some similar notion. For example, in classical Newtonian physics, the state of an object, such as a basketball, is given by specifying its position relative to some coordinate axis and its velocity.5 Quantum mechanics differs from other physical theories such as Newtonian theory in delimiting what are possible states of a system. In particular, quantum mechanical states have the property that a quantum system cannot have both a well-defined position and velocity. It may have one or the other but not both. This deviation from classical mechanics is a consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations.\nWhen quantum mechanics was first developed in the 1920s, it was not always clear how the possible states of a quantum system should be specified. Pioneering work by Eugene Wigner provided a means for specifying what the possible set of states should be through the notion of symmetry. The word as it is used today in physics refers to transformations in the description of a system that entail no change in that system. A snowflake, when rotated through certain angles about its center, is transformed into itself. The set of all such symmetry transformations is called a symmetry group, or sometimes just a group. A sphere, such as a basketball with no markings on its cover, exhibits a larger symmetry than the snowflake symmetry in that there are many more transformations about the center of the sphere (in fact there are an infinite number) that leave the sphere unchanged.\nWhat is important here is that theories also can exhibit symmetries. A theory exhibits symmetry if under the group of symmetry transformations the form of the theory remains unchanged. For example, the Newtonian equation F=ma has the property that under transformations from one inertial frame to another its form does not change. Similarly, Einstein discovered that Maxwell\u0092s equations, which relate electric and magnetic fields to charged particles, have a symmetry different from Newtonian symmetry. This discovery led to the creation of the special theory of relativity.\nSymmetry plays an even more important role in quantum mechanics than in classical mechanics, for the equations of quantum theory should have the property that probabilities expressed in one inertial frame are the same as in any other inertial frame. A first consequence of symmetry in quantum theory is that it generates the possible set of states of a system. That is, if the structure of quantum theory is to have the same form in all inertial reference frames, there is a unique way of specifying what the possible states of a system are, and the manifold of these states (called a Hilbert space) follows from the structure of the symmetry group.\nA second and equally important consequence of symmetry in quantum mechanics is that it generates the quantities that are observable for a quantum system. These quantities are called operators because they operate in a definite manner on the possible states of the system and specify the alternatives open to it. The most important such operator is the energy operator. For a given quantum system, an important goal is to specify the energy operator and then extract from it the possible energy values (alternatives) open to the system.6 One early success of quantum theory in the 1920s was computing the possible energy levels of the hydrogen atom and seeing that they agreed with the experimentally known levels.\nOperators are of two types: those that are invariant (or unchanged) under transformations from one inertial frame to another, and those that are changed. The observables connected with operators that are invariant include the mass, spin, and charge of a given particle. For example, every electron in the universe has the same mass, spin, and charge; they have no alternatives open to them with regard to these observables. The values of these quantities identify an object as being an electron rather than a proton or a hydrogen atom (which is the bound state of an electron and proton). A proton has the same spin as an electron, but it differs in mass and charge, whereas all protons in the universe have the same mass, spin, and charge (as well as other intrinsic properties).\nA third consequence of symmetry in quantum mechanics is that the set of states of composite systems (such as the hydrogen atom) are products of the set of states of their constituents. This consequence means that the set of states of composite systems is richer than the possible states of the individual particles making up the composite system. For example, the hydrogen atom is a composite system, made out of an electron and a proton. Its structure is richer than either the electron or proton in that it has many more invariant quantities associated with it than the electron or proton by itself. It has a ground and many higher-level (excited) energy states, with different possible spins, whereas the electron (or proton) has only one mass and spin. This principle\u0097that composite systems are richer in invariant observables\u0097continues in the hierarchy through atoms and molecules and up into biological systems. We will see that this has important consequences for our model of consciousness.\nBesides the invariant operators generated by the symmetry group, there also are noninvariant operators, such as the position or velocity operators, whose form does change under transformations from one inertial frame to another. But the form of these operators also is given by the symmetry group, and the possible outcomes of measurements of observables related to such noninvariant operators is specified by the symmetry group. Although no alternatives are open to objects such as electrons as regards their mass, spin, and charge, the noninvariant operators, such as position, do provide observables for which there are alternatives. For composite systems such as the hydrogen atom, both the invariant and noninvariant operators provide alternatives that are open to the system, indicating a richer set of alternatives as compared with the fundamental objects making up the system.\nTo predict the outcomes from measuring some observables of a system, it is necessary in any scientific theory to know the state of the system before the measurement is made. In quantum measurements, an ensemble of identical systems is prepared in such a way that its state is known. For example, a beam of electrons is prepared so that its velocity is centered around a given prescribed value. Such is the case in electron accelerators, where the electron beams are then scattered off targets to learn something about the nature of the target particles. The velocity of an electron beam is a noninvariant property of electrons. Other electron beams may have different velocities, but all electron beams consist of electrons with the same mass and spin.\nIf the state of a system is known at some time, it may evolve into another state at a later time. The principle by which states of systems evolve in time is called the dynamics of the system and usually is specified by a differential equation. In Newtonian physics the dynamics of the system is governed by the differential equation F=ma. If the position and velocity of a basketball are known at some time, and the forces acting on the basketball are known (mostly gravitational and frictional forces), the state (position and velocity) of the basketball at a later time can be predicted. In quantum mechanics, by contrast, the evolution of states in time is governed by an equation called the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. It is deterministic in that if the state of a system is known at some time, the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation will specify the state of the system at a later time.\nPrecisely at this point in our summary of quantum mechanics a peculiar feature of quantum theory appears that raises the question of what quantum mechanics means. If a measurement is made on the system at a particular time using the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the theory predicts only the probabilities of outcomes of that measurement. Unlike the Newtonian example, where the position and velocity of the basketball at a later time are uniquely specified, quantum theory predicts only probabilities; it says nothing about the outcomes of individual occurrences. The prediction of probabilities of outcomes is tested by doing experiments on ensembles of identically prepared systems with different sets of alternatives. In all known cases, the experimentally measured outcomes agree with the probabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics with high precision.\nTo make this point more concrete, consider the following experiment. A beam of electrons impinges on a gas of hydrogen atoms that are assumed to be in their lowest energy state. An example would be a fluorescent light bulb in which the gas in the bulb is hydrogen. When the current is turned on, the electrons in the current interact electromagnetically with the hydrogen atoms, altering the velocities of the electrons and causing the hydrogen atoms to go to higher (excited) energy states. The excited atoms spontaneously drop to lower energy states by emitting light quanta called photons. This is what happens when the fluorescent bulb is turned on. The important point in this example is that only certain energies (alternatives) are open to the hydrogen atom. When an electron interacts with a hydrogen atom in its lowest energy state, quantum theory can accurately predict the probability of the hydrogen atom\u0092s going to some higher energy state. These probabilities are verified experimentally by counting the number of photons that are emitted from a given energy level of the atom. Yet quantum theory cannot predict the behavior of individual atoms.\nIn this experiment, a finite number of alternatives are open to the hydrogen atoms. Precisely this limited set of alternatives is seen experimentally, and no others. Moreover, other experiments proscribe different sets of alternatives. For example, in the two-slit experiment, a continuous range of alternatives is possible. Consider again a beam of electrons, not in this case interacting with hydrogen atoms but just passing through two slits and then impinging on a screen where their position is recorded. In this situation, the alternatives open to the electrons form a continuum, inasmuch as the electrons can impinge anywhere on the screen. Quantum theory predicts how the probability of an electron impinging on the screen varies from point to point. At some points on the screen the probability of finding an electron is almost zero; at other points it has some maximum value. The alternatives open to the electrons include all points on the screen, but the probabilities vary widely from point to point. Even when such experiments are carried out with different types of particles, such as neutrons or hydrogen atoms, the predicted probabilities always agree with experiment.\nWhat are we to make of such behavior? Why is quantum theory mute with regard to the outcomes of individual events?\nWe argue that quantum theory is a theory of alternatives in that, for a given experiment in which an observable quantity (such as the energy) of a system is measured, it specifies the alternatives that are open to the system. For the example given of the hydrogen atom, only certain values of the energy are possible, and in an experiment measuring the energies of the atom, only these values are available.7 No other alternatives are available to the hydrogen atom as far as the bound-state energy levels are concerned.\nQuantum theory cannot account for why an individual atom opted for one energy state rather than another when it was measured. All quantum mechanics can say is that when the experiment is done repeatedly on an ensemble of identically prepared hydrogen atoms, the probabilities for outcomes of any of the alternatives open to the atoms are specified by the formula given in note 7.\nAlthough the alternatives open to a system are calculated from the operators acting on the states of the system, the probabilities of outcomes are given by both the state of the system at the time of measurement and the projection operator related to a given alternative. This means that states of systems can be so prepared that, even though an alternative is in principle open to the system, the probability of finding a given alternative may be zero. This happens in the two-slit experiment; there are locations on the screen where the probability of finding an electron is essentially zero.\nWe argue that from a given set of alternatives specified by quantum theory, individual quantum systems spontaneously opt for one alternative rather than another, and that this opting is a primitive form of consciousness, not reducible to any more fundamental category. That is, matter at the quantum level exhibits not only material aspects such as the invariant properties of mass, spin, and charge but also protomental properties that are manifested in experiments in which matter opts from a set of alternatives specified by quantum theory.8 Why we call such opting a manifestation of primitive consciousness is discussed in the next section.\nTwo further points must be made here. First, it is clear that many objects exhibit no form of consciousness even though they are made of electrons and nuclei. Rocks, chairs, and basketballs do not seem to exhibit any form of consciousness. Put differently, they do not have alternatives open to them from which they can opt, one over another. In order for our model to be coherent, we must be able to show why many systems in our everyday world exhibit no trace of consciousness. Second, many systems at the macroscopic level do exhibit various forms of consciousness. Relative to plants or other animals, it seems clear that there is hierarchy of matter, starting with basic constituents such as electrons and nuclei, through atoms such as the hydrogen atom (on the ground that composite quantum systems have more alternatives open to them than their constituents do), to molecules (such as the water molecule), and on to more and more complex systems (Sch\u00e4fer 2006, 522). The higher the level in the hierarchy, the more alternatives are in principle open to the system.\nWhy, then, do many macroscopic systems not exhibit quantum behavior? Various answers have been given to this question. Probably it is fair to say that the quantum mechanics of macroscopic systems is not yet fully understood. (This does not affect our model of consciousness, because the reasons that macroscopic systems do or do not exhibit quantum properties are independent of any interpretation of quantum mechanics.) The reason usually given for quantum systems not exhibiting quantum behavior has to do with sizes and orders of magnitude. If one computes the interference pattern that should occur when basketballs are thrown at a wall containing two windows (the two-slit experiment), the spacing between maxima in the probability pattern is so small by orders of magnitude as to be forever immeasurable. Similarly, if one applies the rules of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation to the orbit of a thrown basketball, the uncertainty is so tiny that one can talk with certainty about the orbit of the thrown ball. But such answers do not seem to get at the heart of the matter. They seem only to indicate that the kinds of measurements made on quantum systems, such as electrons or hydrogen atoms, are not possible with macroscopic systems.\nThere are several possible explanations of why many macroscopic systems do not exhibit quantum behavior. The first involves the notion of decoherence. The basic idea is that macroscopic systems are never isolated systems; they are in constant contact with their environment. The environment is constantly and erratically fluctuating, thereby washing out any quantum behavior. Experiments involving electrons and hydrogen atoms succeed so spectacularly in showing quantum behavior precisely because the system is isolated from its surroundings. This condition is almost never met for macroscopic systems. Jitters from earthquakes, random variations of the wind, interactions of light with the system, and the like all contribute to minute fluctuations that wipe out quantum behavior. If an atomic two-slit experiment were not carefully isolated, the interference pattern would be completely washed out.\nOne may object that if electrons and hydrogen atoms can effectively be isolated from their surrounding environment, why can\u0092t basketballs or rocks? That is, under what conditions might macroscopic systems exhibit quantum behavior?\nSeveral conditions are necessary, even when the system is well isolated from its environment. The most important is our second reason: The temperature of the system must be very low so that the thermal motion of the system does not wipe out the quantum effects being sought. As we rise in the hierarchy of matter to systems with more and more constituents, their internal structure accordingly becomes richer. At higher levels of complexity, the spacing between energy levels becomes smaller and smaller. With very small spacings between energy levels it becomes increasingly difficult to keep thermal agitations from eliminating any quantum effects, unless the temperature is very low (Greenstein and Zajonc 2006, 185\u0096214).\nCertain carefully constructed macroscopic systems, such as superconductors, do exhibit quantum behavior which satisfy the conditions just adduced. To the extent that such systems have alternatives open to them, they do indeed, in our model, exhibit primitive forms of consciousness.\nWhy do macroscopic systems such as cats or human beings exhibit consciousness? This question is related to the existence of brains and nervous systems, which seem necessary to produce consciousness of the sort that human beings have, including the rich inner life of experience. Here we simply say that protomental consciousness found in quantum systems is built up into more sophisticated forms of consciousness when the systems become complex enough to have brains and nervous systems. Like all other conscious beings, cats and human beings choose from the alternatives that are available to them. However, they manifest their consciousness in a more sophisticated way than the primitive consciousness found in simple quantum systems without nervous systems or memory.\nSo far in this essay we have argued for the existence of a protomental or primitive consciousness at the level of simple quantum systems, as indicated by the opting of such systems from a manifold of alternatives made available to them by a measuring device. Complex systems are made from simple quantum systems, and there is a hierarchy of more and more complex systems. We hold that these more complex systems split into two branches: the organic branch, whose systems continue to opt from alternatives, and the inorganic branch, whose systems do not. The organic branch has more and more complex alternatives open to it as systems move through simple organisms to ones such as cats and human beings, where brains and nervous systems play a key role. However, as we discuss in the next section, the fundamental property of consciousness is maintained through the whole of the organic hierarchy.\nSARTRE AND THE SPONTANEITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS\nIn 1936, Sartre published a remarkable treatise on consciousness titled The Transcendence of the Ego. Sartre was himself firmly situated within the traditions of Husserlian phenomenology, yet he used Husserl\u0092s own version of Cartesian doubt to deliver a radical critique of the received doctrine of the transcendental subject as ultimate source of the meanings that unify experience. Sartre maintained the fundamental principle of phenomenology conceived as a descriptive science\u0097thinking should orient itself \u0093to the things themselves! (zu den Sachen selbst!)\u0094 Husserl employed this principle in conceiving the intentional structure of consciousness: Consciousness is always consciousness of something and thus has an intentional object.\nSartre continued to think of intentionality as the essential structure of consciousness. As mentioned earlier, however, in his later writings Husserl explained the intentional structure of consciousness with reference to the constituting activity of the transcendental ego. In Husserl\u0092s view, according to Sartre, \u0093It is because all my perceptions and all my thoughts refer themselves back to this permanent seat that my consciousness is unified\u0094 (Sartre [1936] 1957, 37). On this point, Sartre objects to Husserl\u0092s highly theoretical explanation as a departure from his method of strict description. In The Transcendence of the Ego he refutes the later Husserl, arguing that it is not necessary to posit a constituting ego behind consciousness and somehow inhabiting it both materially (as empirical ego) and formally (as transcendental ego) (p. 31).\nWe find Sartre\u0092s analysis to be convincing and incorporate it into our model. Here we show what exactly we take from Sartre\u0092s philosophy of consciousness and how it connects to both the meaning of quantum mechanics and the proposal for a modified panpsychism.\nSartre\u0092s argument is based on rigorous description of what he calls unreflected consciousness, which refers to conscious acts and meanings in their immediate experiential and direct givenness. In his view, unreflected consciousness does exhibit the structure of intentionality, as Husserl set it forth, but with a crucial difference. According to Sartre, the essential nature of unreflected consciousness is that it transcends itself toward its object, and thereby it finds its unity in the object (p. 48). His description of consciousness thus contradicts the received model of consciousness as the act of a transcendental subject constituting the unity of its intentional object by conferring meaning on it. For him, unreflected consciousness is a sheer, spontaneous activity of being outside itself in presence to objects. Consciousness is like a sparkling (Sartre\u0092s term: \u00e9clat) onto the world, like a light focusing on and illuminating objects. In itself it is nothing; onto-logically speaking, consciousness is \u0093being-for-itself,\u0094 which is contingent and dependent on \u0093being-in-itself,\u0094 toward which it erupts (Sartre 1992, 617, 681). In his view, there is no I in unreflected consciousness, inhabiting it and conferring meaning on its contents. For example,\nWhen I run after a streetcar, when I look at the time, when I am absorbed in contemplating a portrait, there is no I. There is consciousness of the streetcar-having-to-be-overtaken, etc., and non-positional consciousness of consciousness. In fact, I am then plunged into the world of objects; it is they which constitute the unity of my consciousnesses; it is they which present themselves with values; with attractive and repellant qualities\u0097but me, I have disappeared; I have annihilated myself. There is no place for me on this level. And this is not a matter of chance, due to a momentary lapse of attention, but happens because of the very structure of consciousness. (Sartre [1936] 1957, 49)\nSartre is clear that unreflected consciousness is, strictly speaking, inaccessible to description. Any description of unreflected consciousness necessarily entails the intrusion of a different form of consciousness\u0097reflecting consciousness\u0097that turns the prior unreflected conscious acts and meanings into \u0093reflected consciousness\u0094 ([1936] 1957, 44\u009648). Reflecting consciousness refers to conscious acts of bending back on prior acts of consciousness in order to understand their intrinsic structure\u0097what any conscious act is and what it means. Unreflected consciousness is always reflected to some degree; hence, it is modified in the act of reflection. Even reflecting consciousness is, in its immediate givenness, a mode of unreflected consciousness that requires a new act of reflection to grasp it ([1936] 1957, 45). However, Sartre holds that in spite of this unavoidable structural limitation we can focus the mind on the immediacy of unreflected consciousness, using memory and imagination to recall the immediate experiences of unreflected consciousness. The intrusion of reflection does not render the intuitive givenness of unreflected consciousness inaccessible or distorted beyond understanding.\nIt is important to recognize that Sartre\u0092s position does not deny Des-cartes\u0092 irrefutable demonstration of the existence of the I in the cogito, ergo sum. In incorporating Sartre\u0092s view of unreflected consciousness into our model we are by no means embracing a postmodern deconstruction of the ego or a version of the narrative expressing the \u0093end of the self.\u0094 Sartre\u0092s point, with which we agree, is a different one: The I does not appear at the level of unreflected consciousness but appears only through the form of reflected consciousness as the source of consciousness ([1936] 1957, 51). In reflected analysis of unreflected conscious acts, we posit the I as source within the structure of intentionality. As such, the I is not given in immediate experience but is posited by reflection as an existent object that is transcendent to the unreflected consciousness (pp. 52\u009653).\nIn understanding human consciousness, it is crucial to understand the difference between the unreflected and reflected levels of consciousness. This distinction has long been known, but only Sartre recognized that the I formally appears only at the level of reflected consciousness. At the level of unreflected consciousness, subjectivity takes the form of immediate, nonthetic self-consciousness, by which he means an immediate awareness of or acquaintance with oneself that does not formally posit the I ( pp. 46\u0096 47). The original field of conscious activity is \u0093pre-personal,\u0094 without an I (p. 36). Formal thinking of the I is always reflected consciousness, for which the I is a transcendent object conceived as the originating unity of states and actions (p. 70).\nMost important for our argument, as we interpret and adapt Sartre, is that the essential feature of unreflected consciousness is \u0093spontaneity\u0094 (pp. 41, 97\u009698). The spontaneity of consciousness is the capacity of being what one does; unreflected consciousness is what it produces through itself (p. 70). Through its spontaneity, consciousness introduces meaning, significance, differentiation, and purpose into being. But this spontaneity of consciousness has no other cause than itself in its freedom as an opting among alternatives. For example, I may say \u0093I like chocolate ice cream but dislike vanilla,\u0094 a statement that reflects an immediate, unreflected state of consciousness. This state has a subjectivity about it; in liking chocolate, there is immediate self-awareness of my own inner life as determined by the feeling. This subjectivity determines itself through its action\u0097it is what it has opted for. Alternatives present themselves: repulsion, attraction, and indifference (not everyone likes chocolate)\u0097but a choice is made spontaneously, based on nothing but the subjectivity of taste. The subjectivity of opting is grounded only on the individuality of being; all that reflection can say to justify the opting is that I am the person I am. Others may like vanilla, or even strawberry, but I like chocolate.\nReflection, of course, still has an important role to play in our model of consciousness. Through reflection on my acts of opting I may seek reasons to justify my specific acts of opting or I may resolve to change my behavior in the future. Reflection can and sometimes should intervene as a determinant of thought, action, and possibly even feeling. Furthermore, I may reflect on the general principles, concepts, and rules of taste or action, and thus I may develop a reflective discipline of aesthetics or ethics. Nonetheless, the phenomenological point is that my liking chocolate appears spontaneously and without reflection. It simply happens through the subjectivity of opting when I taste it. The event is neither random nor determined.\nAccording to Sartre, unreflected consciousness has an ontological priority over reflected consciousness in that the latter is a secondary construction with regard to the former. We agree with this claim. Whatever I may think about my response to chocolate as an immediate state of unreflected consciousness, it remains a fact that at the spontaneous level chocolate attracts me (although it could be otherwise). Ultimately, no reasons can be given why I like chocolate and dislike vanilla; I just do. Psychologists can probably construct experiments according to which they can make accurate probabilistic predictions as to what percentage of people will be repelled, attracted, or indifferent to vanilla or chocolate, just as political scientists can predict voting behavior at election time. But in these cases, as in the case of quantum behavior, the opting behavior of individuals remains inscrutable. No one can predict with certainty how any one person will respond to different flavors.\nQUANTUM MECHANICS AND PANPSYCHISM\nIn this section we come to the perhaps surprising conclusion that our model may in fact be a modified version of panpsychism.9 David Skribina defines panpsychism as follows: \u0093All objects, or systems of objects, possess a singular inner experience of the world around them\u0094 (2005, 16). This definition characterizes the basic doctrine of panpsychism. It means that all objects, or systems of objects, have a mental or protomental quality internal to them that is manifest in a unitary experience or pattern of behavior. Our model is a modified version of panpsychism because, as already stated, not all objects in the world exhibit protoconsciousness according to our criterion of opting. Our modified version has scientific, not metaphysical, warrant. Nonetheless, the discovery of the same structural quality of opting in both higher organisms and the fundamental material constituents of the universe justifies our modified version of panpsychism.\nIn current discussions of mind, arguments sympathetic to a panpsychic form of consciousness have been given by Thomas Nagel, and more recently by William Seager, over against competing theories. In their pared-down forms, the alternatives are dualism, materialism, emergentism, and panpsychism. Dualism is strongly discredited today by philosophers, who point to metaphysical problems in relating mind and matter (among other questions), and by neuroscientists because it lacks scientific warrant. Nonetheless, many philosophers of mind, while rejecting dualism, resist the full-blown reduction of consciousness to material reality.\nEmergentism is one possibility for avoiding both dualism and materialism. It holds that the property of consciousness emerges in biological organisms out of nonconscious biochemical constituents at some point in the history of evolution. The problem with emergentism was well expressed by W. K. Clifford in 1874:\nWe cannot suppose that so enormous a jump from one creature to another should have occurred at any point in the process of evolution as the introduction of a fact entirely different and absolutely separate from the physical fact. It is impossible for anybody to point out the particular place in the line of descent where that event can be supposed to have taken place. (in Seager 1997, 277)\nPanpsychism is the remaining possibility. Nagel\u0092s argument (1979, 181; 1986, 8; 2005, 230\u009631, 234) is that if consciousness is not reducible to configurations of matter, no matter how complex, and if there are no truly emergent properties, a primitive form of consciousness must have been present already in the simple forms of matter that make up the more complex configurations. To quote Seager, \u0093Emergence is impossible, reduction is absurd\u0097so elements of consciousness must be found in the basic construction materials of the universe\u0094 (1997, 277).\nThe main objection to panpsychism is called the combination problem. It is \u0093the problem of explaining how the myriad elements of \u0091atomic consciousness\u0092 can be combined into a new, complex and rich consciousness such as that we possess\u0094 (Seager 1997, 278). The problem can be extended by asking why some macrosystems possess consciousness and others do not. But this is precisely the issue we addressed earlier in explaining why some systems such as rocks or chairs do not exhibit consciousness and others, such as organisms, do. We noted that certain conditions must be met for a macroscopic system to have alternatives. Most systems do not satisfy these conditions. Others, like superconductors or liquid helium, behave like quantum systems. They can be said to exhibit a primitive form of consciousness of the same kind as found in electrons or hydrogen atoms.\nThe harder part of this objection is the question of how atoms and molecules, when combined into complex configurations leading to organic systems, generate more complex forms of consciousness. Although we are not able to answer this question in any definitive way, there are hints as to how richer forms of consciousness might arise. Earlier we discussed decoherence, including the decoherence of systems in an energetic environment, as an important mechanism for wiping out quantum behavior. Some models have been proposed for explaining how quantum coherence may be maintained in organisms. Surely these models must include the emergence of nervous systems and memory storage devices (Hameroff and Pen-rose 1997, 177\u009696). Our point is that whatever the mechanism might be, the property of opting from a set of alternatives remains as a basic feature of consciousness, even at the level of human beings, as seen in the phenomenological analysis of Sartre.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this essay we have presented a model of a fundamental property of consciousness, namely, the capacity to opt from a set of alternatives. We claim that this capacity of opting is common in the hierarchy from nuclei and atoms, governed by quantum mechanics, through simple organisms to higher-level organisms and finally to human beings. We also make a claim concerning how consciousness arises in the world, with respect to both physical conditions and its evolution into higher forms. Briefly, we argue that the fundamental property of consciousness as opting occurs already in the very nature of elemental matter. It continues to manifest itself in increasingly sophisticated and complex forms in organic life, including human beings.\nOur proposal does not obviate the need for research now carried out in neurophysiology and neurobiology. It continues to be mysterious how consciousness as manifested in experience is generated on top of the fundamental property of opting from alternatives. We have argued that neural systems and brains are necessary to produce such further manifestations of consciousness, but how this actually comes about is unknown. The gulf between the protoconsciousness of nuclei and atoms and the consciousness of human beings is immense, and nowhere is this gulf clearer than in saying that atoms opt but human beings also can choose\u0097that is, reflect on the alternatives available to them. Thus, if our model is correct, it has wide-ranging implications for new types of research.\nOur model also has far-reaching implications for a number of areas traditionally associated with consciousness. An algorithmic device can never be conscious in our sense, simply because it has no alternatives open to it; an algorithm is by definition not open to alternatives. Hence, any device such as a computer that embodies the structure of a Turing machine can never be conscious. It may be able to simulate consciousness but can never properly embody it. Further, the Turing test for consciousness cannot be meaningful as originally proposed by Turing, because, even if the device behind the curtain appears to be conscious, if it is algorithmically driven, no matter how sophisticated it may be it can only simulate and never genuinely manifest consciousness.\nWe therefore basically agree with Searle\u0092s Chinese room example (Searle 1980, 417\u009624; 2004, 62\u009664, 69\u009672), which is intended to show the irreducibility of consciousness to programmable functions. The algorithmic aspects of the Chinese language may appear to incorporate meaning, but in principle they never can. More generally, translation devices may, over time, be more and more successful in translating from one language to another, but to the extent that they are algorithmically driven they can never capture the full meaning of statements in the richness of their contexts. Understanding meanings within a language always involves something more than following rules. Even learning machines cannot be said to be conscious if they are driven by higher-level algorithms. Introducing randomness into such machines also will not help, because there is a fundamental difference between devices that incorporate random elements and the spontaneity of opting. Devices that incorporate deterministic and random elements can merely simulate such opting.10\nFinally, our model shows the inadequacy of Colin McGinn\u0092s mysterian position on the problem of consciousness. McGinn (1999, 5 and passim) argues that the human mind has so evolved that it is incapable of understanding the link between the brain as a material system and consciousness; evolution has structured the human brain so that it is well equipped to deal with scientific or mathematical problems, but the hard problem of consciousness is not a problem that the human brain can solve. In this article we have developed a model that shows at least in principle how dualism and materialism can be overcome. Our model points the way to a solution to the hard problem by connecting the phenomenon of opting in matter to the same phenomenon in human spontaneity. It may turn out that our model is wrong or too limited to fully explain consciousness, but the important point is that it is a model. McGinn underestimates the ability of human imagination to create new models for dealing with a wide variety of problems\u0097even the hard problem of consciousness.11\nNOTES\nFor an expanded account of what we mean by a \u0093model,\u0094 see Klemm and Klink 2003.\nDualism claims that the universe, and everything in it, consists of two interrelated principles of mind and matter. Universal mentalism holds that all reality, including material reality, can ultimately be reduced to ideas in human or divine consciousness.\nIn this article we deal only with nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The reason is that, while quantum field theories such as quantum electrodynamics are in excellent agreement with experiment, the bound-state problem in quantum field theory is notoriously difficult, so it is difficult to talk about a hierarchy of matter in quantum field theory.\nThere are a number of ways of grounding nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, including the Feynman path integral approach and the Dirac Poisson bracket approach. We think that the symmetry approach used in this essay is the most conducive to seeing how quantum theory is a theory of alternatives.\nIn Newtonian theory, the state of a solid object is not specified just by its position and velocity, for it may also be spinning about some axis. Strictly speaking, only idealized point masses have states specified by just position and velocity.\nExtracted are the eigenvalues of these operators, which then give the possible outcomes of measurements of the observable.\nThe formula that gives the probability of outcomes is given by the product of the state of the system at the time of measurement times a projection operator related to a possible given outcome; more technically it is given by Tr p(t)P(k), where p(t) is the state of the system at time t (p is called the density matrix), P(k) is the projection operator for the observable value k, and Tr is the trace operation.\nFor important alternative views, see Stapp 1993 and Sch\u00e4fer 2006.\nOn the issue of a panpsychism implied by quantum reality, with a critical perspective on Pierre Teilhard de Chardin\u0092s panpsychist vision of biological evolution, see Sch\u00e4fer 2006.\nThe distinction we are making here can be further elucidated by considering the different ways in which probability arises. When one says that the probability of a thrown die giving the number 2 is 1/6, the probability arises from ignorance. In principle, if all the forces and initial conditions on the die were known, it would be possible to predict the appearance of the number 2. In quantum mechanics, probability does not arise from ignorance but seems absolute. However, Einstein (and others) tried to show that probability in quantum mechanics could also be understood as arising from ignorance. This is the hidden-variables theory of quantum mechanics. Various theorems, including Bell\u0092s theorem, severely reduce the possible class of hidden-variables theories to nonlocal theories. Bohm\u0092s hidden-variables theory is not ruled out by experiment because it is constructed to agree with the predictions of conventional quantum mechanics. But the Bohm theory is very nonlocal and has a number of other deficiencies.\nThe point we are making is that if the capacity to opt among given alternatives is a correct explanation of individual events at the level of microphysical particles, it can be connected all the way up the hierarchy of matter to organic beings and to human freedom. If, however, the hidden-variables interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, so that the appearance of opting actually comes from some underlying determinism, our model could be falsified. We do not presume to demonstrate the correctness of our model, which, like all models, invites criticism through testing. We do propose that the evidence supporting our model is strong enough to deserve further testing.\nREFERENCES\nChalmers, David. 1997. \u0093Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness.\u0094 In Explaining Consciousness, ed.

Left to right: Jack Sarfatti, Saul-Paul Sirag, Nick Herbert, and Fred Alan Wolf (seated)\nDr. Wolf\u2019s importance as a theoretical physicist is underscored by his participation as a core member of the Fundamental Fysics Group of the Lawrence Berkele y Laboratory in the 1970s.\u00a0 The group was started by Elizabeth Rauscher and George Weissmann, both then graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley, to discuss the philosophical implications of quantum theory.\u00a0 The group included many influential physicists, Fritjof Capra,\u00a0John Clauser, Philippe Eberhard,\u00a0Nick Herbert,\u00a0Jack Sarfatti, Saul-Paul Sirag, Henry Stapp, and Fred Alan Wolf.\u00a0 Capra\u2019s book, The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism (1975) is a famous one from that time, exploring the relationships being explored by the Fundamental Fysics Group.\nThis group was very important in the development of San Francisco and the Bay Area\u2019s counterculture, much celebrated as an important part of the Hippie Movement.\u00a0 The movement, of course, had a great many heroes, including Allen Ginsberg , The Grateful Dead, and the City Lights Bookstore .\u00a0 But physics, science, and intellectual thought was to become an important part of San Francisco counterculture, partly through the support of Francis Ford Coppola , who bought City Magazine in 1975.\u00a0 Soon after his purchase, the magazine featured the group, making them local celebrities.\u00a0 However, many in the group were ultimately pushed outside of traditional academia.\nThus, the people who made the video on YouTube, apparently have not only animated Dr. Fred Alan Wolf as he pondered the incongruities of the quantum physics he studied in the 1970s, but they sought to explore the implications that have fascinated so many physicists, scientists, intellectuals, and philosophers since.\u00a0 It is these implications that are extremely important to consider \u2013 not just the truths or facts that seek to explain realities, but the questions and convoluted incongruities that science has a great difficulty explaining.\nThe Double-slit Experiment and the Paradox of Modern Physics\nGoing back to the Double-slit Experiment, we know now that the experiment led to some of the most important scientific principles of contemporary science.\u00a0 Put simply, the experiment is a demonstration that matter and energy can display characteristics of both waves and particles .\u00a0 Electrons, which are defined as very small particles, behave, at times, as both particles (as expected) and (unexpectedly) as waves.\u00a0 The video portrays this confusion quite effectively.\nThe paradox that is at the heart of this confusion is now widely known as the Observer Effect .\u00a0 The term refers to changes that the act of observation will make on the\u00a0phenomenon\u00a0being observed.\u00a0 A common real world example is the checking of tire pressure in a car.\u00a0 The act of checking the tire\u2019s pressure results usually in letting out some of the air, which changes its pressure.\u00a0 This phenomenon occurs repeatedly throughout many domains of physics.\u00a0 In fact, it is very difficult to measure anything very accurately without somehow influencing the result.\nThis is most famously represented in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle .\u00a0 This principle is often confused with the Observer Effect, because the two are very related.\u00a0 The uncertainty principle actually describes how precisely we are able to measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time; the more we increase the accuracy in measuring one, we always lose accuracy in measuring the other. The observer effect, however, relates to the influence an observer has on a system.\nStill, what is clear from both is that the more we try to observe closely a physical phenomenon, our ability to measure accurately what we are seeing can be extremely difficult.\u00a0 In one, the results themselves are changed.\u00a0 In the other, we cannot measure accurately two factors inherent to a particle.\nMy Conclusions\nThe Nobel Award-winning American physicist, Richard Feynman , was apparently fond of saying that all of quantum mechanics can be gleaned from carefully thinking through the implications of this single experiment.\u00a0 While I don\u2019t intend to imply that I have the capability of understanding physics on par with Feynman, I cannot but agree.\nI always have believed that what I observe has a profound effect on what happens.\u00a0 I realize clearly that my presence at my sons\u2019 soccer matches affects their performance, just as knowing my father was in the audience made me remember the lines I had forgotten in the rehearsal of my graduation speech in elementary school.\nSome may dismiss both of these examples as \u201cunscientific\u201d and because they are highly anecdotal.\u00a0 I cannot refute directly such arguments.\u00a0 But the physics I know and understand leads me only to conclude that my participation as an observer in everything I see, record, and attempt to understand and explain has an effect on what actually happens.\u00a0 The effect may be minute and difficult to measure, but I know that that small element exists.\nThat small element, too, just might make a vital difference.\u00a0 It just might stop the violence in a war-stricken nation, or the perpetration of injustice in a so-called democratic power.\nI like that belief.\u00a0 So I observe.\u00a0 I record.\u00a0 I report.\u00a0 I explain what I see.\nAnd, I think to myself, that I can make a difference in the world.\n"}, {"score": 2714.7231, "uuid": "2b8fc9fd-b87b-53dd-913f-7d64522a97e9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1208wb-69-23883", "target_hostname": "brannenworks.com", "target_uri": "http://brannenworks.com/oldquant.html", "page_rank": 1.2114063e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "Classical <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>", "snippet": "This factor comes from <em>the</em> conversion <em>between</em> <em>quantum</em> <em>and</em> classical interference. <em>Quantum</em> interference <em>is</em> defined as a straight subtraction, but classical interference takes <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>and</em> divides by that extra factor of two.", "explanation": null, "document": "Classical Quantum Mechanics\nAbstract\nAn analysis of quantum interference and Schroedinger's equation from a classical point of view suggests that an alternative topology to Minkowski space using hidden dimensions will allow a single relatively simple wave equation to have solutions representing multiple particles with all the features of quantum statistics and spin, as well as wave function collapse, but without the complexity of quantum field theory.\nCarl Brannen,\nApril 10, 2003\n[0] Introduction\nThere are two paths that physics have achieved success in understanding the world. The first, and most common, is in the ability to predict the results of experiments. This branch has had successes in the last century that would have, and did awe the physicists at the beginning of that period. But the other path is in better understanding the nature of physical reality, and in this, physics has not only failed to make much progress, but many of the facts that were known in 1903 have since been shown to be false. The purpose of this short note is to speculate on paths to further this second success. That is, my purpose here is to suggest ways that we might improve our understanding of the fundamental rules of reality, rather than continue to improve our calculations for the (admittedly fascinating) details.\nPhilosophically, the highest success of physics in explaining the fundamental nature of physical reality has to be relativity, which showed that space and time are part of the same object, and gave the rules for converting between them. The incredible successes of quantum mechanics in calculating everything from particle lifetimes to cross sections has not been associated with an equivalent improvement in our understanding of fundamental reality. The reason for this is fairly clear; after most of a century, the interpretations of quantum mechanics are not only still unintuitive, they remain subject to debate. While the nature of the reality behind the experiments is still not just cloudy, but completely opaque, the calculations for those experiments have been markedly accurate. Quantum mechanics has been successful at everything except at being understood.\n[1] Some difficulties in understanding reality.\nHumans have lousy physical intuition.\nThese difficulties are well known to physicists (who are the intended audience of this note). I'm including them so that I can give my particular spin on the interpretation of these conundrums, as well as to bring them to mind.\n[1.a] Wave / particle duality.\nIt's clear that there is both a wave and a particle nature to the world. Relativity works only with particles, quantum mechanics deals with waves or fields.\n[1.b] Proper time vs bizarre time.\nRelativity deals with proper time, quantum mechanics can be made to be Lorentz invariant, but never uses proper time. Instead, quantum mechanics makes a mockery out of time, with particles apparently travelling backwards in time. The usual interpretation of the two slit experiment is that the electron does not have a particular location at a given time. This is in contradiction to either the particle nature of the electron, or the usual understanding of time.\n[1.c] Nonlinearity vs linearty.\nThe mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, eigenvectors and operators, is linear, but quantum mechanics itself is nonlinear. The nonlinearity is expressed in the associated rules, particularly Fermi / Bose statistics, and wave function collapse rules.\n[1.d] Causality vs entanglement.\nWhile relativity restricts influences to the speed of light, quantum mechanics entangles particles over space-like separations. While this is, on the face of it, a violation of the principle that the speed of light is the fastest influence, relativity is fighting a losing battle by claiming that no data can be transferred using entanglement. This may be true (good people are working on it), but as far as the question of the nature of the universe goes, it is clear that causality, as it is usually understood, is at best, \"history\".\n[1.e] Random vs predictable.\nThe usual interpretation of quantum mechanics has the results of measurements generally random. But every now and then the universe provides us with an example where there are correlations that suggest that it isn't quite so simple. The existence of entangled states suggests that what quantum mechanics attributes to \"probability\", could more likely be attributed to \"human inability to unravel complicated entanglement situations\".\n[1.f] Wave mechanics vs operator formalism.\nIf you want to make calculations, the formalism of quantum mechanics is the way to go, but wave equations sure seem like a more realistic description of the universe. The least formal QM equation is Schroedinger's wave equation. More useful theories require, at the very least, spinors, but provide no \"ether\" for those spinors to operate on. Instead, you end up with a wave function where each point in space has associated with it a collection of (complex) numbers. This just doesn't compare to the beauty of general relativity and its geometric objects.\n[2] Bohmian mechanics.\nAt night, the hidden variables that are hiding under lamp posts are the easiest ones to find.\n[2.a] Introduction to Bohmian Mechanics.\nProbably the most popular alternative to the Copenhagen interpretation is \"bohmian mechanics\". When I was a graduate student I had never heard of it, but I understand that it's getting more attention nowadays. But for those who are unaware of it, I'm including a short description here. If you want to learn more about it from a more reputable source, do a search using google for \"bohmian quantum mechanics\" and you will find plenty of hits. If you are not familiar with Bohmian mechanics, here are some web links that will explain the theory in more detail: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/ http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9504010\nBohmian mechanics is an alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics where additional variables are added. The added variables indicate the actual positions of the particles. That is, the particles are assumed to always have precise locations. In order to account for interferences, an additional potential (\"quantum potential\") is added to the usual (classic) potential. Thus a complete description of a particle is its wave function and it's initial position. Note that the wave function does not depend on the initial position, but the particle track depends on both the initial position and the wave function. This is the most (only?) successful hidden variables theory.\nSurprisingly, if you assume that the input states to an experiment follow the usual quantum mechanical distribution, Bohmian mechanics shows that the output states will also follow those distributions. That is, under the assumption that the universe is already follows the usual quantum mechanical distributions, Bohmian mechanics has predictions for the evolution of those distributions that are identical to those of quantum mechanics. In short, Bohmian mechanics reduces quantum mechanics into a branch of statistical mechanics. Maybe it would be the standard theory if it didn't have a few problems.\n[2.b] Problems with Bohmian mechanics.\nThe most difficult to swallow part of Bohmian mechanics is that it is highly non local. The particle is influenced by conditions in regions which it never approached. But since the predictions match that of quantum mechanics, the Bohmian supporters argue that this is not a problem, but is instead a physical necessity. Nevertheless, I find it rather difficult to believe that the universe is set up so that particles know about regions that are far from where they exist.\nBohmian Mechanics' most difficult problem is said to be that it does not yet have a field theory. A recent paper by S. Goldstein, D. D\u00fcrr, R. Tumulka, and N. Zangh\u00ec \"Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory\" gives a simple field theory for Bohmian mechanics, but it has the same disadvantage that regular quantum mechanics has, the particle interactions are handled probablistically. Sheldon Goldstein's articles are linked from his web site here: http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~oldstein/ But if Bohmian mechanics itself is any guide, a deeper understanding of particle interactions (maybe in the form of a wave function) will provide an opportunity to replace these probablities with calculated results from initial conditions. So from the point of view of understanding the physical nature of the world, I don't find the lack of a field theory to be decisive, per se. What is more important is that Bohmian mechanics is not relativistic (but see paper cited above).\nA minor problem with Bohmian mechanics is that it implies that the particle trajectories that it computes turn out to be stationary for some bound states. In particular, the \"s\" states for a central force are purely real, and so have no probability flow. These states (and others) therefore have no electron movement. Of course this is in a playpen version of the theory, and one presumes that an analysis that included a dynamic vacuum would add enough randomness to walk the electron around the nucleus.\nAnd I have a philosophical problem with Bohmian mechanics in that it seems odd that the universe would associate such diverse things as an exact particle position with a wave. For this I have a suggestion, a way of combining these two disparate notions. I'll discuss it in my notes on Schroedinger's equation, but the basic idea is to extend Schroedinger's equation to a single (simple) equation that includes both particle and wave solutions.\n[3] Guidelines for fundamental fields.\nSymmetry is not necessarily simple.\n[3.a] Symmetries can be deceiving.\nSince the discovery of broken symmetries in quantum field theory, it's become clear that the symmetry that nature possesses is not necessarily apparent in what is observed in the physical world. But the situation is worse than that. There are plenty of examples of very unsymmetrical objects which appear to have symmetries that they do not, in fact possess. Even crystals, with their explicit breaking of continuous translational and rotational symmetry, can exhibit (at low energies), isotropic characteristics.\nSymmetries are very attractive to the human brain, and there may be a tendency to exaggerate their importance. Certainly the periodic table of the elements has many beautiful symmetries, but it would be difficult to derive Schroedinger's wave equation from those symmetries. Instead, one would have to happen upon the correct wave equation, and then notice that its solutions possessed the symmetry one observed.\nSymmetries that are apparent at our usual energies may be accidents that obfuscate the underlying simplicity. In a contest between perfect simplicity and perfect symmetry, the place to put your bet is on simplicity. For computing matrix elements, imperfect symmetries are great, but the fact that they are not perfect is an indication that they are probably coincidences, rather than indications of the fundamental reality.\nHistorically, most of the advances in physics have come from rejecting symmetries that were previously assumed clear. The earth was once considered the center of the universe, an obvious symmetry. The planets were assumed to go around the sun in circular (S1) orbits, or in orbits defined by the meshing of spheres. Time and distance measurements were assumed to be everywhere equal. If a Lagrangian possessed a certain symmetry, then it was assumed that its vacuum states would too. Etc.\n[3.b] The mathematics and its interpretation should be very simple, but non linear.\nMost of man's successes in physics can be attributed to the success of linear models. This should not be a surprise; the drunk man tends to look for his wallet under the street lamp first. He does this because he'll find it quickly, if it's there. And naturally it is the linear approximations that have had the most success in physics. In addition, those interpretations will likely appear very strange, as otherwise they would have already been made.\nThe simplicity of the mathematics will imply that it may not be very useful as far as predicting the results of high energy particle experiments. This would be consistent with our present advances in physics. For example, while QED has been very successful at improving calculations for high energy particles, it has not helped improve calculations in more prosaic physics such as band gaps in germanium semiconductors. A new dynamics for extremely high energy situations needs to provide a framework where lower energy dynamics are explained, but it need not improve the calculations for those lower energy situations.\nWhen relativity first appeared nearly 100 years ago, it did not improve calculations for much of physics. It was only with the passage of time that it worked its way into the wide range of physics where it is visible today. We can't expect a new dynamics theory to be a super theory that explains everything, but instead we should expect it to be a simple tool that explains a few of our outstanding mysteries.\n[3.c] Only real functions should be included.\nAny equation that uses complex (or more complicated) numbers can be broken down into real equations. Complex numbers themselves are no more than a particular symmetry, so their inclusion should not be seen as a simplifying assumption any more than SU(6) is simple (g). General relativity, for example, is able to describe the universe rather accurately without the use of complex numbers, and it is this theory that has given us the most significant peek into the nature of the real world.\nI should mention that there is a way of replacing the complex numbers from Schroedinger's equation in a way that produces a simpler equation. The idea is to replace factors of i in the equation with d/ds, where d/ds is a derivative in an extra dimension, and simultaneously add a factor exp(i s) to the wave function. The resulting equation supports all the usual solutions of Schroedinger's equation, but also includes extra solutions which, depending on various choices, correspond to particles with higher mass or coupling constant. I'll include more details further on in this note.\nBy banning complex functions, I don't mean to exclude them where they simplify the mathematics, only to distrust them as far as their being fundamental objects. For example, physicists commonly use exp(it) for a sinusoidal function, taking real parts at the end of the calculation.\n[3.d] It must avoid formalism.\nRather than representations of things, we need to have the thing itself. As an example of this, consider a hydrogen atom. From the point of view of understanding the spectra, the raising and lowering operators are very useful, but from the point of view of understanding the fundamental nature of the universe, Schroedinger's equation, with it's explicit use of space and time is closer to reality.\nOne of the problems with formalism is that they almost always assume the existence of symmetries. By using formal theories, one ends up being unable to produce a theory which violates those symmetries, even if the violation would be below the level detectable with current experiments.\nNoether's theorem, which associates symmetries with conserved quantities, is a good example of the attractiveness of symmetries. The Heisenberg uncertainty relationship suggests that energy is only conserved on a probabilistic basis. A theory which failed to conserve energy (or momentum), in some small amount, would therefore not only be consistent with observational evidence, but the existence of that uncertainty relationship is almost equivalent to a blinking neon sign: \"look over here, no one else did.\" The universe is limited in terms of its age and size, so Heisenberg's uncertainty principle places limits on how accurate it is even theoretically possible to design an experiment intended to test for conservation of energy and or momentum. In other words, not only are energy and momentum not known to be exactly conserved, present theory holds that they are not, in fact, conserved exactly at all. Under this situation, would it not be natural that a fundamental theory would have conservation of these things as an approximate symmetry rather than an exact one? Note: I don't propose to repeal these conservation laws, I am making this point only to give the professional reader a reason to briefly consider theories not written in the formalism of Lagrange or Hamilton, and perhaps not writable at all that way.\n[4] Hypotheses for a fundamental theory of mechanics.\nWhat IS the sound of one hand clapping, and why are we teaching this to our students?\n[4.a] Begin with Bohmian mechanics.\nBohmian mechanics has the advantage of having a single interpretation. The more formal theories have the disadvantage of being too tied into symmetries that at the very least may hide an underlying simplicity, and at the worst may not be exact.\n[4.b] Use hidden dimensions when they simplify the model.\nBy hidden dimensions, I mean stuff along the line of Kaluza-Klein, where relativity plus an added dimension gives electricity and magnetism. String theory has also had some success by bringing in hidden dimensions, but string theory has the same weaknesses as the formalism that gave birth to it. None of the usual quantum mechanical paradoxes is resovled by string theory, except for UV issues.\n[4.c] Let the particle go through both slits.\nIf the underlying mathematics is going to be simple, it's going to have to be interpreted in only one way. In standard Bohmian mechanics, the particle is treated as a point particle with exact positions at any given time. Under this circumstance, it doesn't make much sense that the particle could be influenced by goings on many lightyears away, but if the particle position is treated as the result of the wave function collapse, the theory becomes more intuitive. That is, the paths that the particle can make are influenced by interference, but after the particle makes its choice (which I am guessing has something to do with the proper time experienced by the particle), its path resolves to a single choice. Maybe a way of putting it would be to say that the particle \"thinks\" about going through each slit.\nThis can only be accomplished if our usual understanding of either particles or time is modified. Before the particle actually makes its voyage its wave function is aware of all the choices, but as time goes on, the wave function collapses on to the path actually chosen. The current standard interpretation of Bohmian mechanics makes this possible by by defining the particle to have two parts, a wave function and a position. This is more complicated than I'd like. I think that there is another way of accomplishing the same thing, and that is to consider the position of the particle as defined by a wave collapse that occurs as proper time transpires. This leaves the particle able to be influenced over space-like separated regions before the wave is collapsed, and as time passes, the particle's wave is collapsed down to its position. Long after the experiment has completed, we can observe the particle's track, but we can also see the influences of the wave nature of the particle. The result is that the particle's wave did traverse both slits, but as time progressed, the particle's path became frozen and a particular path was selected.\n[4.d] Use proper time in quantum mechanics.\nIf it is the passage of time that causes a wave function to collapse, then by the principles of special relativity, that time will have to be proper time. But neither quantum mechanics nor relativity include proper time as a dimensional variable. Instead, proper time is a derived quantity. If proper time is how wave functions collapse, then it needs to be brought into quantum mechanics in a more direct way. Under this interpretation (i.e. Bohmian mechanics with proper time as the wave function collapse mechanism), the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics looks only at the physical situation at an \"advanced time\" (to misuse the concept of \"advanced\" somewhat), that is, before the particle traverses the slits, while the particle track exists in \"retarded time\".\nAdding a decay rate that is proportional to proper time does add complexity, but it may be that there is a simple underlying equation that can be interpreted to have a standard quantum mechanical wave part for the time before the particle goes through, and also a decay to a collapsed wave function afterwards. Certainly it's no worse than having things as they now stand, with waves and particles having to share the fundamental spotlight.\nNote that proper time is associated with individual particles. It is not an attribute of a reference frame or a collection of particles, as each of those particles may have different ages.\n[5] Some notes on Schroedinger's equation\nWho taught Mother Nature to do complex arithmetic?\nFor reference, Schroedinger's wave equation for a scalar particle in a potential V(r):\n(5.1) i\nh\n/ 2m \u0394 + V(r)) \u03a8 (r,t) .\nBefore going into further discussion, I should first note that this equation applies only to experiments that have not yet been run. That is, it is a postulate of quantum mechanics that after you run an experiment, the wave function is collapsed into whatever you end up observing. In that sense, the t variable in the above equation can only be interpreted as applying to a time in the future, not the past.\nOver the years more than one mathematician (including my father who bought the copy of Messiah quoted later on) has asked me more than once why it is that the wave function is complex and requires an absolute value and squaring operation before it can be interpreted as a probability. I think this is a useful question to address.\nBefore a student can understand (standard) quantum mechanics, he must first study classical mechanics. Classical mechanics originated with analyzing a collection of masses, with each mass having a position and velocity (or momentum). These are governed by Newton's three laws, which are still taught. In order to more simply analyze situations where particles are constrained (by ropes, for example), and/or where it is desired to use more arbitrary coordinates (spherical coordinates for central forces problems, for example), Lagrange's equations of motion are used. In these 2nd order equations, the positions and velocities become \"generalized coordinates\" and \"generalized velocities\" and the constraint equations are no longer apparent but are implicit. The Lagrangian equations of motion can be transformed to Hamiltonian equations, which replace the 2nd order differential equations with twice as many 1st order equations. It is perhaps indicative of a certain mindset in theoretical physics, that the variables now containing the information about positions and velocities are known in the Hamiltonian formalism as \"canonical coordinates\".\nThe Lagrangian or Hamiltonian formalism can be naturally extended to continuous systems of matter. It is this continuous extension that is directly connected to quantum mechanics.\nThe Hamiltonian formalism for continuous systems requires two functions to describe the field. That there are two functions is why the quantum wave state cannot be described with a single real valued function (though I will later in this chapter show an extension of Schroedinger's equation that does require only a single function). Having a single real valued function could provide a probabilty density, but it would not also be able to provide a velocity at the same time. Yes, I know that this more or less directly contradicts my previous sentence, but to get a velocity out of a real valued function I have to add an extra dimension.\nNote that the Hamiltonian coordinates are generalized coordinates. This means that there is no particular reason why they should correspond to a probability density as opposed to a complex square root of a probability density. In fact, it's easy enough to rewrite Schroedinger's wave equation so that one of the two wave functions is the probability density (as we will see in the next section). These observations suggest that the question of \"why does the quantum wave function require squaring a complex absolute value to get a probability density\" could instead be written: \"why is the complex version of the quantum wave function so simple?\".\nOne of the most fruitful ideas of physics has been the principle of linear combinations. Sine waves are particularly useful in physics because they can be added together in linear combinations to create more sine (or cosine) waves. Another very fruitful assumption in physics has been the principle of perturbations. The combination of these fruitful assumptions suggests that a simple theory of quantum mechanics would arise from equations which (a) support sine waves, and (b) are linear. But sine waves go negative, so they can't be used as probability densities. The simplest way to convert such a wave to a legal probability density is to square it.\nGiven the above, and recognizing the formal nature of quantum theory, it is natural that the quantum wave state be given by a complex valued function. But one might also ask if this is a case of the missing wallet being searched for under the lamppost. The nonlinear, non perturbed parts of physics are the more complicated ones, so it is natural that our dearest successes have been in the areas where linear combinations and perturbation analysis work best. This is not in the region of time where the wave function has collapsed and is concentrated, but instead in the future, where the wave function is as dilute as possible.\nThere is another clue from the above notes, and that is that the formalism of quantum mechanics is based on principles of classical mechanics that involve constraints. This suggests that when we look for more fundamental descriptions of quantum mechanics that involve extra dimensions, we look around for more or less natural constraints that can be added at the same time. In particular, what kind of constraint would turn a simple version of Schroedinger's equation (using the probability density and velocity field version) into a simple but less linear equation perhaps using more dimensions?\n[5.a] Schroedinger's wave equation as an attractor\nSince Schroedinger's wave equation (for scalar particles) is the most simple quantum mechanical wave equation, it is a good idea to understand it thoroughly before trying to replace, say, QED, with something more fundamental. The natural inclination is to convert Schroedinger's complex equation into two equations in the reals. There are two obvious ways that this can be done. We can write \u03a8 = x + i y, or we can write \u03a8 = R exp(i \u03b8). The first way leads to two coupled equations, similar except for a minus sign or two, and no obvious way of interpreting it physically except as two coupled equations. But splitting Schroedinger's wave equation into x + i y and adding a hidden dimension to allow it to be written as a single real equation does lead to some interesting insights, so I've provided some notes on this subject in Appendix B. The second separation, \u03a8 = R exp(i \u03b8), is the more fruitful and it is that separation that I will pursue for most of this paper.\nRather than convert all the gory details into HTML, let me quote Messiah who does pretty much what we want, but uses \u03a8 = A exp(i S/\nh\n) and then goes on to take the classical approximation\nh\n-> 0. My copy is apparently the first English edition (John Wiley ~1961), look in pages 222-224 of volume 1, in the beginning of the section entitled \"Classical Limit of the Schroedinger's Equation\". Making this substitution, and seperating into real and imaginary parts, and multiplying by 2A gives two equations, one for \u2202S/\u2202t [refer (VI.17) in Messiah], the other for \u2202A/\u2202t [refer (VI.19)]:\n(5.2a) \u2202S/\u2202t + grad2 (S) /(2 m) + V = (\nh\n2 / 2m) (\u0394 A) / A,\n(5.2b) m \u2202(A2)/\u2202t + div(A2 grad S) = 0.\nEquation (5.2b) is simply the continuity equation for the probablity density A2. It can be interpreted in a purely classical manner. Messiah interprets S to be a potential that generates a velocity field v for that probability density (where J is the usual probability current density) [refer (VI.21)]:\n(5.3) v = J/A2 = grad(S) / m.\nMessiah then shows that (with\nh\n= 0) the velocity field follows the law of motion for a classical fluid under the influence of the given potential. But if he had not taken the classical limit, the conclusion that S was a potential for a velocity field would have still been valid, as there is no\nh\nin the probability continuity equation (5.2b).\nSince the probability density acts like a classical fluid, as opposed to a gas, it need have only a single velocity defined at each point. This is not what a statistical ensemble of (non interacting) particles with various positions and velocities would give. Such a collection would be a gas, rather than a fluid. Instead, the \"particles\" strongly interact, and they interact in such a way as to allow only a single velocity at each point in space.\nS only shows up with a gradient, except for the term indicating how it changes with time. It is therefore possible to take the gradient of that equation (5.2a), and then make a change of variables to replace grad S with m v:\n(5.4) m \u2202v/\u2202t + grad(v2 / 2m) + grad V = (\nh\n2 / 2m) grad(\u0394 (A) / A).\nAs an aside, you can work the right hand side of the above equation to use A2 instead of A, but the result is about as complicated, and the final result can be written in several distinct ways. Also note that the only term that is not already a gradient is the \u2202v/\u2202t term. This means that the above equation can be used to compute the time evolution of velocity fields which are not the gradient of any S.\nEquation (5.4) is useful in that Schroedinger's equation has automatically built into it the assumption that \u0394 X \u0394 P \u2265\nh\n. So if you wanted to see what the time evolution of a wave state that was initially more tightly concentrated than Heisenberg's uncertainty principle would allow, you cannot evolve the function using Schroedinger's wave equation. That is, if you minimize \u0394X by packing all of A2's support into a very small region, you end up with \u2202/\u2202x being very large. But by using the above equation, you can initialize both the position and the velocities to whatever you like (and use v explicitly for the probability density velocity). Of course if your initial conditions satisfy Schroedinger's wave equation, then the computed evolution will match Schroedinger's. Since all the changes to mv can be written as a gradient, one would expect that the discrepancy between mv and the velocity field that has a potential, and therefore that can be associated with Schroedinger's wave equation would decrease with time as the effects of the initial conditions recede into the past, though I have not derived this.\nEquation (5.4) also suggests a way of combining the particle and wave in Bohmian mechanics, and thereby make more explicit the probability wave collapse. As I mentioned earlier, Schroedinger's wave equation is suitable only for experiments that are in the future. But equation (5.4), which includes Schroedinger's, also has solutions for waves with position and momentum both as accurately described as needed. This makes a wave function that is more compatible with our own intuitive nature of time. Only the future is nebulous, the past cannot be changed. But while we gloss over the transition between past and future, equation (5.4) allows that transition to be made explicit.\nIn this interpretation, the particle's position and momentum were perfectly (at least exponentially perfectly) defined in the far past. The present corresponds to a period where the error in position and momentum exponentially increase, until they knit into the future where Heisenberg's uncertainty principle applies completely. Equation (5.4) supports solutions to the wave equation with this property.\nBut there are problems with equation (5.4), chief among them being that it doesn't have the right statistics or spin. That is, when you translate the interference that we all know that quantum waves experience back into equation (5.4), you end up with a horribly complicated mess. So while (5.4) gives the feel for what I believe we should be searching for, it is not a very direct signpost to that spot. On the other hand, equation (5.4) is compatible with the usual quantum mechanical spin, and it supports solutions with SU(2) symmetry without the need for a complicated or arbitrary topology for space-time, or for functions with more than the usual classical complexity. More on this subject in a later section, where we will look at the classical interpretations of angular momentum and spin.\nI should note that there are undoubtedly a lot of other equations that have Schroedinger's wave equation as an attractor. Maybe one of these is such a simple equation that it is a more natural candidate for a fundamental theory. But given the problems with a non relativistic spinless theory, I'm not inclined to spend a lot of time searching for one.\n[5.b]Interference in Schroedinger's wave equation\nInterference between alternate pathways is one of the primary features of quantum mechanics, and since Schroedinger's wave equation has a classical limit, it makes sense that we should take a look at quantum interference for Schroedinger's.\nThe first thing to note is that \u03a8 is a complex function, so its interference shows up in the form of a complex addition. The addition, when expressed in terms of our real variables A and S, is rather complicated. Why does it work so well? We all know where freshmen in college learn about adding complex numbers, but I fail to see who taught mother nature the details. The explanation that \"mathematics models reality amazingly well\" is true enough, but I'm looking for an understanding of physical reality, not a good model.\nMy guess is that Schroedinger's wave equation is a formalism rather than a fundamental part of nature. That is, the complex numbers are a symmetry that is not necessarily obvious in the underlying fundamental reality. More fundamental theories, like relativity, get by just fine with the reals, quantum mechanics should too. (Try finding a complex number in Misner Thorne and Wheeler's Gravitation.) Unfortunately, with quantum mechanics, Schroedinger's wave equation is the most fundamental object I've got, so any analysis has to start here.\nRather than looking at the 2-slit experiment, I think we will make better progress by looking instead at interference effects between two particles. The interference in the 2-slit experiment is understandable strictly as a wave effect, and as such isn't any more interesting than the similar effects that show up with light. I've already concluded that the fundamental nature of matter is waves, so the 2-slit experiment doesn't surprise.\nBut the interference effects between two (or more) identical or non identical particles are more interesting. There are four cases worth running through the calculations on, identical fermions (two electrons), identical bosons (two pions), distinguishable particles (an electron and a proton), and identical classical particles. Note that all this talk about indistinguishable particles is perfectly consistent with our thinking of them as some sort of waves. Of course waves are indistinguishable. If we instead thought of particles as point particles I would think that they would still be indistinguishable, but by assuming that the fundamental nature of them is a wave this doesn't come up. Waves is waves.\nThe quantum mechanical fundamental description for a single particle consists of its wave function, whose informational content includes a probability density and a velocity potential. The corresponding description for two particles is a joint probability density, and a joint velocity potential. The joint probability density is a function on R3 x R3, as it has to provide a density value for the two particles. The two position coordinates will be called x1 and x2. To be specific, let P(x1, x2) d3x1 d3x2 will be the probability that the the first particle is found within d3x1 of the position x1, and the second particle within d3x2 of the position x2.\nI've already made the more sensitive wince, by refering to \"first\" and \"second\" particles just inches from having previously assumed that they are identical. Because of this defacto enumeration of the particles, most of our calculated probability density values will be 1/2 (for n particles it would be 1/n! ) the literal value, (but they'll be correct when x1 = x2). The reason physicists use this way of counting instead is that it makes the wave functions easier to normalize and calculate with. That is, if our space only had two points, a and b, then we will have P(a,a) + P(a,b) + P(b,a) + P(b,b) = 1.\nWe'll compare the four cases using notation common to the quantum case. So let P1(x) and P2(x) be the the probability densities (i.e. P = A2), and S1(x) and S2(x) be the velocity potentials for the corresponding quantum particles.\nIf the particles are distinguishable, the combined probability density is just the product of the densities:\n(5.5) Pdist(x1, x2) = P1(x1) P2(x2)\nIf the particles are identical, but are classical, we have pretty much the same thing, but since the particles are identical, we have to take this fact into account. Note that the factor of 2 is from our splitting the density for x1 \u2260 x2 into to two parts; the factor which may have caused wincing:\n(5.6) Pclass(x1, x2) = (P1(x1) P2(x2) + P1(x2) P2(x1)) / 2.\nThe formulas for fermions and bosons are more complicated as they also depend on A. In these equations, the \u00b1 indicates bosons (+) or fermions (-):\n(5.7) Pquant(x1, x2) = (P1(x1) P2(x2) + P1(x2) P2(x1)) / 2\n\u00b1 [P1(x1) P1(x2) P2(x1) P2(x2) ]1/2 cos [ ( S1(x1) - S1(x2) ) - ( S2(x1) - S2(x2) )/\nh\n].\nThe complexity of the interference term is consistent with quantum mechanics being a perturbational theory. That is, the theory is beautifully linear as long as no particles risk being put into the same position, but the interaction between two particles is highly non linear.\nNote that S1 or S2 could have a constant added to it with no change in the result. This is a global symmetry of S. But there is also a local symmetry in that local changes to S by multiples of 2\u03c0\nh\nresult in no change in the joint probability density. These observations also apply to the joint velocity potential, Squant(x1, x2). Also note that if P1 and P2 share no support, then the quantum mechanical formula is identical to the classical one, which supports the decision to divide \u03a8 into two real functions.\nThe fact that the joint wave function does not depend, even locally, on changes in S by 2\u03c0\nh\nsuggests that S should not be considered to be a real function. Instead, it's natural range should be S1. This explains, in a circular manner, why it is that mapping of P and S into complex form results in such a simple wave equation.\nAlso note that if one of the two wave functions has a constant added to S, there is no change to the resulting interference effects. That is, S1 only shows up as the difference in its value between two points. A global addition of a constant has no physical effect. This fact suggests that there is a simpler way of looking at spin than to represent it as an SU(2) symmetry.\nFrom the discussion so far, one could get the impression that S can be a well defined real function of real space, but a brief consideration of bound states for the hydrogen atom with non zero angular momentum show that this is not the case. The simplest such state is the p-wave eigenfunction with angular momentum in the z direction of 1. Since life is short and HTML is long, I'm leaving off the normalization factors, and using spherical coordinates:\n(5.8) \u03a8211 = r exp(-r/2a0) sin(\u03b8) exp(i \u03c6).\nNote that the above equation ignores the dependency on t, which I'll include back in later. For now it's sufficient to ignore time dependence, and to look at the interference effects at only a single moment in time. From equation (5.8), it's clear that S211 depends only on \u03c6, and that it depends on \u03c6 in a discontinuous manner. That is, S is discontinuous at \u03c6 = 0 == 2\u03c0. This fact suggests that the natural way to implement Schroedinger's wave equation is with the v variable instead, using equation (5.4).\nSince v is defined by the gradient of S, converting equation (5.4) into an equation for v instead of S requires an integral. Since the integral is a path integral, it's not obvious that the result does not depend on the path chosen. Of course if our solution is also a solution of Schroedinger's equation, then the existence of the velocity potential S implies that there is no path dependency. If we restrict ourselves to cases where x1 and x2 lie on the same trajectory, we can use the trajectory to define S from v without having this worry. But since Schroedinger's has this fact (that an S exists for any \"physically possible\" v) built into its equation, I'll ignore this problem for now. The resulting equation for quantum interference, as defined by velocity instead of velocity potential, is therefore as follows (with a very small amount of arithmetic), and I've chosen to parameterize the path integrals by \u03b7, with units of distance. This way the units are made obvious:\n(5.9) Pquant(x1, x2) = (P1(x1) P2(x2) + P1(x2) P2(x1)) / 2\n\u00b1 [P1(x1) P1(x2) P2(x1) P2(x2) ]1/2 cos [ \u222b12m (v1 - v2)/\nh\n\u2022 d\u03b7 ].\nThat (5.9) seems less complicated than one might expect is a good indication that we're not getting too far away from the trail of a simple equation with Schroedinger's wave equation as a limiting case. But about that cosine function. While a cosine is to be expected in any interference calculation, this interference is not the usual type. To contrast this interference from the type of interference we're used to in classical equations, it's useful to examine a classical interference, say between two cosines simply added together in the usual way. To simplify this a bit, let's take the two waves to both be cosines, both with unity amplitude. The more general case with various amplitudes of sines and cosines gives frequency results that are similar, but this case is sufficient to detail the interference.\n(5.10) cos( A ) + cos( B ) = 2 cos((A + B)/2) cos((A - B)/2).\nEquation (5.10) has the usual interference terms that we come to expect. Two frequencies are present in the combination. The first carries the average frequency and corresponds to a wave with an intermediate wave vector. The second depends on the difference, and is the inteference term.\nComparing to equation (5.9), we see that quantum interference is similar to classical interference, but only the A-B term is present. The two cosines on the left hand side of the equality in (5.10) do not show in (5.9), nor does the A+B term on the right hand side. The missing cosines are present only in the complex description of the wave function, they disappear when the wave function is split into the two classical parts. This is a little confusing, so let me explain further.\nA quantum mechanical plane wave such as exp(i(kx-wt)) represents a steady flow of particles in a single direction, with the particle density everywhere equal. There is no sine or cosine dependence. Another way of describing this is to note that if one slit of the two slit experiment is covered up, the resulting distribution of particles on the screen is even both in space and in time. There is no physical significance to the oscillations in the quantum wave, except when the wave interferes with itself or others. Thus from a physical point of view there are three missing cosines/sines in the equation for quantum interference, as compared to classical interference.\nSo while quantum interference appears to be very distinct from classical interference, the absence of those three cosines may be due to a limitation of Schroedinger's equation. That is, the missing cosines may show up in a more fundamental theory, but are missing in Schroedinger's wave equation because their frequencies are too high. Instead, these very high frequencies may be averaged over in Schroedinger's equation, so only the low frequency interference term cos(A + B) appears.\nSo we go back and look at the interference term in equation (5.9) once more, and look for an alternative explanation for that interference, one more radical than classical wave interference. The explanation has to involve a structure that somehow combines velocities and positions, and it will probably result in either or both of those being quantized.\nWhat's really odd about this interference is that it is completely cyclic in\nh\n. That is, if you are considering points that are at a distance \u0394x, an addition to the momentum mv1 of\nh\n/\u0394x results in the same inteference. What's also significant is that you can change the intervening momenta (that is, the momentum in the positions between x1 and x2), and provided you change it by an amount that integrates out to 2\u03c0, there is no way to detect the difference at the end points.\nOf course it's an accepted fact that angular momentum is quantized. But the cosine factor in equation (5.9) suggests that there is a milder form of a sort of quantization for momentum itself. That is, that momentum integrated over a distance interferes with itself according to multiples of\nh\n. That this relation involves both position and momentum suggests that it is an artifact of a deeper relationship between those two.\n[5.c] Quantum angular momentum and spin\nSometimes things are not as complicated as they seem.\nIt's frequently said that angular momentum in classical mechanics is analogous to quantum mechanical angular momentum, but that spin is a purely quantum effect. Spin adds the complexity of SU(2) symmetry to quantum mechanics, and it does it in a way that is difficult to extract. So to get to the fundamental physics of spin it is best to approach it first from the more convenient study of angular momentum.\nOne of the features of the half integer representations of SU(2) is that they require rotations by 4\u03c0 in order to come back to return to the the unrotated situation. This feature shows up in spinor representations of fermions, and at first glance it suggests that the world is a very odd place. Classically, rotations by 2\u03c0 leave the system unchanged, but with spinors, the wave function is negated.\nClassically we can get along with just positions and velocities, can we achieve quantum spin with just these variables? Or do we have to follow the spinor representation and end up with a multiply valued fundamental representation of reality?\nAs was noted in section [5.b], changes to the wave function by multiplication by a constant do not change the physical situation. They correspond to the addition of a constant to S, and by equation (5.7), there is no resulting interference effect. Moreover, replacing \u03a8 with P and v completely removes the need for the spinor representations. It's easy enough to create a wave in P and v that has spin 1/2, in fact it's all too easy to create waves with perfectly arbitrary spin. Presumably the difference between particles of various spin is in the details of their wave functions. That is, while the Schroedinger wave equation enforces integer spins for (large) composite objects, it's possible that the equation is only a space averaging approximation for an equation that is applicable to smaller dimensions, and includes half integer spins available only in these smaller sizes. Later on in this paper, I'll show just such a space.\nThis all suggests that the R3 that makes up the obvious part of our real world is not the complete (local) topology of the world, but that there is at least one hidden dimension as well. This more complicated topology is going to have to be consistent with relativity, and support the odd quantum interference effects as well. Since we understand the principles of relativity a hell of a lot better than those of quantum mechanics, the place to start looking for this alternative topology is in relativity. Eventually it would be nice to include general relativity and gravitation, but special relativity definitely comes first.\n[6] A Topology for Proper Time.\nTo make an omelette, you will have to start by breaking a few eggs.\nAs discussed in section [4], the fundamental time of the universe appears to be the proper time that is distinct for each individual particle. That is, the global time that we use in our equations seems to have the character of a convenient parameter to integrate over rather than a fundamental part of the world. So our modified topology should include proper time. And as integration is still a useful thing, we'll include global time as well. This suggests that we begin with the standard Lorentz metric, which allows the computation of proper time in terms of position and global time:\n(6.1) ds2 = dt2 \u0096 (dx2 + dy2 + dz2).\nWhile the abover formula is convenient for computing proper time, it doesn't show proper time as a independent dimension, so let's imitate Einstein a bit and instead treat proper time as if it were a spatial dimension. That is, relativity shows that space and global time are mixed by boosts. Our topology will instead mix space and proper time, and leave global time for calculational purposes only. The metric that we'll use is therefore:\n(6.2) dt2 = ds2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2\nThe above relation gives the amount of global coordinate time required by a particle to move (dx, dy, dz) given that it experiences a proper time interval of ds. It has the advantage over (6.1) that it is positive. So the local topology, instead of being Minkowski, will instead be Riemannian. This is a simpler topology than that of (6.1), so we can expect that some of the odd features of the usual topology of special relativity will vanish from the local topology, and will instead show up only in the global topology.\nWith the local topology selected (i.e. equation (6.2) which gives R4), we must now choose the global topology. We have proper time as one of the coordinates (or dimensions), but we have some interpretation issues. Different particles can experience proper time at different rates, but can nevertheless end up at the same positions. So the proper time dimension must be one that is ignored from the point of view of comparing positions. That is, to compare two positions (to see if there is a collision, for example), we must ignore the proper time coordinate.\nGiving the proper time a cyclic coordinate will allow different proper times to be associated with the same (x, y, z) position. More formally, choose S1 as the topology of the proper time dimension, so that the full topology for points in the space such as (x, y, z, s) is R3xS1, with the S1 circle having a circumference of L. In this topology, the shortest (global) distance between two points will be influenced by the hidden dimension only by, at most, L/2, and so will be neglible for sufficiently small L. What's more, an error in distance of the maximum amount will occur only if the points occupy the same real coordinates.\nThe Proper Time topology violates the basic assumption of special relativity that all frames of reference are equivalent. That is, the topology defines a frame of reference that is the prefered one. But since this topology uses the same metric as Minkowski space, the fact that there is a prefered frame of reference may not be observable, but instead is as hidden as the hidden dimensions that allow this topology to function. Special relativity is an approximate symmetry of this topology instead of an exact symmetry, as will be shown later. For those who have trouble accepting that this topology does transform frames of reference the same way as special relativity does, nothing can be more convincing than calculations, which are provided in Appendix A.\nThis Proper Time topology is perhaps more complicated globally than Minkowski space, but since the metric has no minus signs it is a standard differentiable manifold, and is therefore considerably less complicated locally. The standard results of manifold theory will hold in this space. This is exactly the kind of tradeoff that we're looking for. That is, since the electron is (according to current experimental data) a point particle, if we are looking for a version of Schroedinger's wave equation that gives this particle its\nh\n/2 spin, we must add a complexity to the local nature of space, but that complexity must disappear for larger distances.\nIn the Proper Time topology, the magnitude of the velocity of any particle is c (= 1).\n(6.3) |( dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt, ds/dt)| = 1.\nAnother way of deriving the above relation is to note that if the velocity of a particle in the 3 real dimensions is \u03b2 then by time dilation, the ratio of velocity in the proper time dimension is sqrt(1 - \u03b2 2), so the total velocity of the particle is 1. This relation is built into the metric chosen for the topology, so it should not be a surprise. In fact, you could do the same thing with any space with an arbitrary mechanics, provided the particle speeds have an upper bound. What makes this topology useful for our own universe is that proper time is such an important part of special relativity, and the relations that connect proper time to the regular dimensions make the metric particularly simple.\nHaving all particles travel at the same speed (at least locally), is convenient for calculational purposes, and we can expect that some of the relations of special relativity (such as conservation laws) will be simplified in this topology (and the simple derivations will be provided later). Again, this kind of simplification is what we want, and besides, since it is clear that matter is carried by waves, what would be more natural than to have all waves travel at the same speed? Waves, at least conceptually, require an \"ether\" to propagate in, and the most natural ether is one where all waves travel at the same speed. Anything else requires complicated dispersion relationships.\nIn the proper time topology, the proper time experienced by a particle is measured by how far it moves in the s dimension. While the s dimension is only a circle of circumference L, it is possible to go around that circle many times, so very long proper times can be represented by many orbits around that circle.\nThe defining metric for the proper time topology (6.2) is identical to the metric for standard special relativity, and so the two theories give the same answers when computing times and distances, (at least when ignoring very small discrepancies in positions), but for those readers that are unsure of the concept, or for those who want to see how time dilation and length contraction are computed in a proper time topology, as opposed to the global time topology of special relativity, I've included sample calculations for time dilation and length contraction in Appendix A.\n[6.a] Classical Mechanics in the Proper Time Topology.\nBefore we get into looking at how waves interact with the proper time topology, we should take a look at how special relativity looks in it. One expects that the laws of special relativity will be simplified in this topology, if it is a natural one. This would also be a good spot to collect together the correspondences between special relativity and proper time.\nPlease forgive me for setting c = 1, but then later showing it explicitly, in an inconsistent manner, as well as my switching between a space-like and a time-like metric. Proper Time topology eliminates these confusions as the metric is fully positive, and all dimensions are naturally measured as distance.\nSpecial Relativity vs Proper Time\n.\n"}, {"score": 2698.5154, "uuid": "82d45e70-0774-5786-8bb0-fa01e569b82a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1215wb-44-13482", "target_hostname": "physics.uwb.edu.pl", "target_uri": "http://physics.uwb.edu.pl/ptf/fizyka2000/quantumzone/frequency2.html", "page_rank": 1.3519568e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Classical Orbits <em>and</em> <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>", "snippet": "So at very high values of n, <em>the</em> photon&#x27;s frequency would be pretty much <em>the</em> same as <em>the</em> &quot;vibrating frequency&quot; of <em>the</em> electron--which <em>is</em> <em>what</em> Rutherford&#x27;s model predicts! That&#x27;s right; this <em>is</em> where classical <em>and</em> <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em> overlap.", "explanation": null, "document": "Classical Orbits and Quantum Mechanics\nHow does the correspondence principle apply to the Bohr model and the Rutherford model?\nI'll start at the beginning. You know Bohr's basic theory: electrons in atoms can only be at certain energy levels, and they can give off or absorb radiation only when they jump from one level to another. If an electron falls to a lower energy level, a photon escapes; by the conservation of energy, we know that the energy of this photon is equal to the energy the electron lost--that is, the difference between the higher energy level and the lower one. But we also know that the photon's energy is equal to Planck's constant times its frequency; thus, if we know what the energy levels are, we can figure out what the frequency should be.\nYeah, but how do we know which energy levels are allowed?\nWell, Bohr came up with a formula for that. He didn't have much theoretical justification for it, but it agreed quite well with experimental data. In 1885, about 30 years before Bohr's work, J.J. Balmer had studied the frequencies of hydrogen's spectral lines and had discovered a nice equation that fit these frequencies perfectly. Bohr found that his theory agreed precisely with this formula if he assumed that an electron's angular momentum was restricted to a certain set of values. (It had to be an integer multiple of the quantity Planck's constant over 2 pi, or h bar.)\nI can show you what Balmer's formula was and how Bohr derived the electron's angular momentum from it.\nGiven the angular momentum, Bohr could easily find the electron's speed and orbital radius, which would allow him to calculate its kinetic and potential energy. This in turn meant that the difference in energy between any two orbits could be found, so the frequency of he corresponding photon could be calculated.\nOkay...now what's all this about closely packed energy levels?\nAs I said, the angular momentum had to be an integer multiple of h bar; the integer used was known as n. A value of n=1 corresponds to the ground state, where the electron possesses its lowest possible energy. Examining his formula, Bohr noticed that as n grows larger, the difference between consecutive energy levels becomes smaller and smaller; in fact, it approaches zero as n approaches infinity.\nSo the energy levels are \"closely packed\" when n is large. But what does this have to do with the classical model?\nRemember how we can derive the electron's orbital radius and speed from Bohr's formula? These values in turn allow us to calculate its orbital frequency--i.e., the number of orbits it completes per unit time.\nThat's what we called the \"vibrating frequency,\" right?\nCorrect. Now, here's the amazing part: As n gets larger and larger, the difference between the energy levels n and n+1 gets closer and closer to Planck's constant times the orbital frequency at level n.\nWait a second...we said the difference between the energy levels had to be equal to Planck's constant times the photon's frequency. So at very high values of n, the photon's frequency would be pretty much the same as the \"vibrating frequency\" of the electron--which is what Rutherford's model predicts!\nThat's right; this is where classical and quantum mechanics overlap. Another way to think about this is that the frequency of an emitted photon always lies between the orbital frequencies of the two energy levels involved (a fact that can be proved, with a little algebra). When the energy levels get close together, there isn't much \"space\" between them, so the photon's frequency is squeezed closer and closer to the orbital frequency.\nI can show you an algebraic proof of this relationship between the Rutherford and Bohr models.\nThis is great. Now I can see the connection between the classical way of looking at things, which seems to work well for big objects like stars and planets, and the Bohr model, which describes the way things really are on the atomic scale...\nWell, you don't quite have the whole story yet. In fact, no one knows exactly what's \"really\" going on inside an atom, but we do know that the Bohr model isn't quite right; electrons don't go around in orbits at all. The Schr\u00f6dinger model agrees more closely with the experimental evidence we have, so we presume that it comes closer to describing reality.\nOh, not another model! How does the Schr\u00f6dinger model explain radiation from atoms? Does it still fit in with the idea of \"vibrating charges\"?\nWell, that's another story...\n"}, {"score": 2691.6218, "uuid": "14081850-b286-5195-a4f4-8b55ae2a8368", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0008wb-21-29398", "target_hostname": "phycomp.technion.ac.il", "target_uri": "http://phycomp.technion.ac.il/~comphy/technion_projects.html", "page_rank": 1.6579865e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "<em>Physics</em> Projects from <em>the</em> Technion - <em>Mechanics</em>, <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>, Solid", "snippet": "All of them are purposed to find <em>the</em> eigenvalues <em>and</em> eigenvectors of a given matrix but, there are small <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> them. <em>The</em> first one has been written in C++ <em>and</em> has been compiled by Visual Studio.", "explanation": null, "document": "Physics Projects from the Technion\nProjects from 2005 still have to be added, for now they are here and 2006 ones are here .\nThis is an edited subset of projects prepared in the Physics Department at the Technion, in 1997-2005.

The measurement problem\n\n  Paul Budnik paul@mtnmath.com\n\n  The formulation of QM describes the deterministic unitary evolution of\n  a wave function. This wave function is never observed experimentally.\n  The wave function allows us to compute the probability that certain\n  macroscopic events will be observed. There are no events and no\n  mechanism for creating events in the mathematical model. It is this\n  dichotomy between the wave function model and observed macroscopic\n  events that is the source of the interpretation issue in QM. In\n  classical physics the mathematical model talks about the things we\n  observe.  In QM the mathematical model by itself never produces\n  observations.  We must interpret the wave function in order to relate\n  it to experimental observations.\n\n  It is important to understand that this is not simply a philosophical\n  question or a rhetorical debate. In QM one often must model systems as\n  the superposition of two or more possible outcomes. Superpositions can\n  produce interference effects and thus are experimentally\n  distinguishable from mixed states. How does a superposition of\n  different possibilities resolve itself into some particular\n  observation? This question (also known as the measurement problem)\n  affects how we analyze some experiments such as tests of Bell's\n  inequality and may raise the question of interpretations from a\n  philosophical debate to an experimentally testable question. So far\n  there is no evidence that it makes any difference. The wave function\n  evolves in such a way that there are no observable effects from\n  macroscopic superpositions. It is only superposition of different\n  possibilities at the microscopic level that leads to experimentally\n  detectable interference effects.\n\n  Thus it would seem that there is no criterion for objective events and\n  perhaps no need for such a criterion. However there is at least one\n  small fly in the ointment. In analyzing a test of Bell's inequality\n  one must make some determination as to when an observation was\n  complete, i. e. could not be reversed. These experiments depend on the\n  timing of macroscopic events. The natural assumption is to use\n  classical thermodynamics to compute the probability that a macroscopic\n  event can be reversed. This however implies that there is some\n  objective process that produces the particular observation. Since no\n  such objective process exists in current models this suggests that QM\n  is an incomplete theory.  This might be thought of as the Einstein\n  interpretation of QM, i. e., that there are objective physical\n  processes that create observations and we do not yet understand these\n  processes.  This is the view of the compiler of this document.\n\n  For more information:\n\n  Ed. J. Wheeler, W. Zurek, Quantum theory and measurement, Princeton\n  University Press, 1983.\n\n  J. S.

Schrodinger's cat\n\n  Paul Budnik paul@mtnmath.com\n\n\n  In 1935 Schrodinger published an essay describing the conceptual\n  problems in QM[1]. A brief paragraph in this essay described the cat\n  paradox.\n     One can even set up quite ridiculous cases. A cat is penned up\n     in a steel chamber, along with the following diabolical device\n     (which must be secured against direct interference by the cat):\n     in a Geiger counter there is a tiny bit of radioactive\n     substance, so small that perhaps in the course of one hour one\n     of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability, perhaps\n     none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a\n     relay releases a hammer which shatters a small flask of\n     hydrocyanic acid. If one has left this entire system to itself\n     for an hour, one would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile\n     no atom has decayed.  The first atomic decay would have poisoned\n     it. The Psi function for the entire system would express this by\n     having in it the living and the dead cat (pardon the expression)\n     mixed or smeared out in equal parts.\n\n\n     It is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy originally\n     restricted to the atomic domain becomes transformed into\n     macroscopic indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct\n     observation. That prevents us from so naively accepting as valid\n     a ``blurred model'' for representing reality. In itself it would\n     not embody anything unclear or contradictory. There is a\n     difference between a shaky or out-of-focus photograph and a\n     snapshot of clouds and fog banks.\n\n  We know that superposition of possible outcomes must exist\n  simultaneously at a microscopic level because we can observe\n  interference effects from these.  We know (at least most of us know)\n  that the cat in the box is dead, alive or dying and not in a smeared\n  out state between the alternatives. When and how does the model of\n  many microscopic possibilities resolve itself into a particular\n  macroscopic state? When and how does the fog bank of microscopic\n  possibilities transform itself to the blurred picture we have of a\n  definite macroscopic state.  That is the measurement problem and\n  Schrodinger's cat is a simple and elegant explanations of that\n  problem.\n\n  References:\n\n  [1] E.

The Copenhagen interpretation\n\n  Paul Budnik paul@mtnmath.com\n\n  This is the oldest of the interpretations. It is based on Bohr's\n  notion of `complementarity'. Bohr felt that the classical and quantum\n  mechanical models were two complementary ways of dealing with physics\n  both of which were necessary. Bohr felt that an experimental\n  observation collapsed or ruptured (his term) the wave function to make\n  its future evolution consistent with what we observe experimentally.\n  Bohr understood that there was no precise way to define the exact\n  point at which collapse occurred. Any attempt to do so would yield a\n  different theory rather than an interpretation of the existing theory.\n  Nonetheless he felt it was connected to conscious observation as this\n  was the ultimate criterion by which we know a specific observation has\n  occurred.\n\n  References:\n\n  N. Bohr, The quantum postulate and the recent development of atomic\n  theory, Nature, 121, 580-89 (1928), Reprinted in Quantum Theory and\n  Measurement, p 87, (1983).\n\n\n\n  5.  Is QM a complete theory?\n\n  Paul Budnik paul@mtnmath.com\n\n  Einstein did not believe that God plays dice and thought a more\n  complete theory would predict the actual outcome of experiments.  He\n  argued[1] that quantities that are conserved absolutely (such as\n  momentum or energy) must correspond to some objective element of\n  physical reality. Because QM does not model this he felt it must be\n  incomplete.\n\n  It is possible that events are the result of objective physical\n  processes that we do not yet understand. These processes may determine\n  the actual outcome of experiments and not just their probabilities.\n  Certainly that is the natural assumption to make. Any one who does not\n  understand QM and many who have only a superficial understanding\n  naturally think that observations come about from some objective\n  physical process even if they think we can only predict probabilities.\n\n  There have been numerous attempts to develop such alternatives.  These\n  are often referred to as `hidden variables' theories. Bell proved that\n  such theories cannot deal with quantum entanglement without\n  introducing explicitly nonlocal mechanisms[2].  Quantum entanglement\n  refers to the way observations of two particles are correlated after\n  the particles interact. It comes about because the conservation laws\n  are exact but most observations are probabilistic.  Nonlocal\n  operations in hidden variables theories might not seem such a drawback\n  since QM itself must use explicit nonlocal mechanism to deal with\n  entanglement. However in QM the non-locality is in a wave function\n  which most do not consider to be a physical entity. This makes the\n  non-locality less offensive or at least easier to rationalize away.\n\n  It might seem that the tables have been turned on Einstein. The very\n  argument he used in EPR to show QM must be incomplete requires that\n  hidden variables models have explicit nonlocal operations. However it\n  is experiments and not theoretical arguments that now must decide the\n  issue. Although all experiments to date have produced results\n  consistent with the predictions of QM, there is general agreement that\n  the existing experiments are inconclusive[3]. There is no conclusive\n  experimental confirmation of the nonlocal predictions of QM. If these\n  experiments eventually confirm locality and not QM Einstein will be\n  largely vindicated for exactly the reasons he gave in EPR. Final\n  vindication will depend on the development of a more complete theory.\n\n  Most physicists (including Bell before his untimely death) believe QM\n  is correct in predicting locality is violated. Why do they have so\n  much more faith in the strange formalism of QM than in basic\n  principles like locality or the notion that observations are produced\n  by objective processes? I think the reason may be that they are\n  viewing these problems in the wrong conceptual framework. The term\n  `hidden variables' suggests a theory of classical-like particles with\n  additional hidden variables. However quantum entanglement and the\n  behavior of multi-particle systems strongly suggests that whatever\n  underlies quantum effects it is nothing like classical particles.  If\n  that is so then any attempt to develop a more complete theory in this\n  framework can only lead to frustration and failure.  The fault may not\n  be in classical principles like locality or determinism. They failure\n  may only be in the imagination of those who are convinced that no more\n  complete theory is possible.\n\n  One alternative to classical particles is to think of observations as\n  focal points in state space of nonlinear transformations of the wave\n  function. Attractors in Chaos theory provide one model of processes\n  like this. Perhaps there is an objective physical wave function and QM\n  only models the average or statistical behavior of this wave function.\n  Perhaps the structure of this physical wave function determines the\n  probability that the wave function will transform nonlinearly at a\n  particular location. If this is so then probability in QM combines two\n  very different kinds of probabilities. The first is the probability\n  associated with our state of ignorance about the detailed behavior of\n  the physical wave function. The second is the probability that the\n  physical wave function will transform with a particular focal point.\n\n  A model of this type might be able to explain existing experimental\n  results and still never violate locality. I have advocated a class of\n  models of this type based on using a discretized finite difference\n  equation rather then a continuous differential equation to model the\n  wave function[4]. The nonlinearity that must be introduced to\n  discretize the difference equation is a source of chaotic like\n  behavior.  In this model the enforcement of the conservation laws\n  comes about through a process of converging to a stable state.\n  Information that enforces these laws is stored holographic-like over a\n  wide region.\n\n  Most would agree that the best solution to the measurement problem\n  would be a more complete theory. Where people part company is in their\n  belief in whether such a thing is possible. All attempts to prove it\n  impossible (starting with von Neumann[5]) have been shown to be\n  flawed[6]. It is in part Bell's analysis of these proofs that led to\n  his proof about locality in QM. Bell has transformed a significant\n  part of this issue to one experimenters can address. If nature\n  violates locality in the way QM predicts then a local deterministic\n  theory of the kind Einstein was searching for is not possible. If QM\n  is incorrect in making these predictions then a more accurate and more\n  complete theory is a necessity. Such a theory is quite likely to\n  account for events by an objective physical process.\n\n  References: [1] A. Einstein, B. Podolsky and N.

Meadrmead@ocra.st.usm.ed The Transactional Interpreta-\n  tion of Quantum Mechanics\n\n  The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics (J.G. Cramer,\n  Phys. Rev. D 22, 362 (1980) ) has received little attention over the\n  one and one half decades since its conception. It is to be emphasized\n  that, like the Many-Worlds and other interpretations, the\n  transactional interpretation (TI) makes no new physical predictions;\n  it merely reinterprets the physical content of the very same\n  mathematical formalism as used in the ``standard'' textbooks, or by\n  all other interpretations.\n  The following summarizes the TI. Consider a two-body system (there are\n  no additional complications arising in the many-body case); the\n  quantum mechanical object located at space-time point (R_1,T_1) and\n  another with which it will interact at (R_2,T_2). A quantum mechanical\n  process governed by E=h\\nu, conservation laws, etc., occurs between\n  the two in the following way.\n\n  1) The ``emitter'' (E) at (R_1,T_1) emits a retarded ``offer wave''\n  (OW) \\\\Psi.  This wave (or state vector) is an actual physical wave\n  and not (as in the Copenhagen interpretation) just a ``probability''\n  wave.\n\n  2) The ``absorber'' (A) at (R_2,T_2) receives the OW and is stimulated\n  to emit an advanced ``echo'' or ``confirmation wave'' (CW)\n  proportional to \\\\Psi at R_2 backward in time; the proportionality\n  factor is \\\\Psi* (R_2,T_2).\n\n  3) The advanced wave which arrives at 'E' is \\\\Psi \\\\Psi* and is\n  presumed to be the probability, P, that the transaction is complete\n  (ie., that an interaction has taken place).\n\n  4) The exchange of OW's and CW's continues until a net exchange of\n  energy and other conserved quantities occurs dictated by the quantum\n  boundary conditions of the system, at which point the ``transaction''\n  is complete. In effect, a standing wave in space-time is set up\n  between 'E' and 'A', consistent with conservation of energy and\n  momentum (and angular momentum). The formation of this superposition\n  of advanced and retarded waves is the equivalent to the Copenhagen\n  ``collapse of the state vector''. An observer perceives only the\n  completed transaction, however, which he would interpret as a single,\n  retarded wave (photon, for example) traveling from 'E' to 'A'.\n\n  Q1. When does the ``collapse'' occur?\n\n  A1. This is no longer a meaningful question. The quantum measurement\n  process happens ``when'' the transaction (OW sent - CW received -\n  standing wave formed with probability \\\\Psi \\\\Psi*) is finished - and\n  this happens over a space-time interval; thus, one cannot point to a\n  time of collapse, only to an interval of collapse (consistent with\n  relativity).\n\n  Q2. Wait a moment. What you are describing is time reversal invariant.\n  But for a massive particle you have to use the Schrodinger equation\n  and if \\\\Psi is a solution (OW), then \\\\Psi* is not a solution. What\n  gives?\n\n  A2. Remember that the CW must be time-reversed, and in general must be\n  relativistically invariant; ie., a solution of the Dirac equation.\n  Now (eg., see Bjorken and Drell, Relativistic QM), the nonrelativistic\n  limit of that is not just the Schrodinger equation, but two\n  Schrodinger equations: the time forward equation satisfied by \\\\Psi,\n  and the time reversed Schrodinger equation (which has i --> -i) for\n  which \\\\Psi* is the correct solution. Thus, \\\\Psi* is the correct CW\n  for \\\\Psi as the OW.\n\n  Q3. What about other objects in other places?\n\n  A3. The whole process is three dimensional (space). The retarded OW is\n  sent in all spatial directions. Other objects receiving the OW are\n  sending back their own CW advanced waves to 'E' also. Suppose the\n  receivers are labeled 1 and 2, with corresponding energy changes E_1\n  and E_2. Then the state vector of the system could be written as a\n  superposition of waves in the standard fashion. In particular, two\n  possible transactions could form: exchange of energy E_1 with\n  probability P_1=\\\\Psi_1 \\\\Psi_1*, or E_2 with probability P_2=\\\\Psi_2\n  \\\\Psi_2*. Here, the conjugated waves are the advanced waves evaluated\n  at the position of R_1 or R_2 respectively according to rule 3 above.\n\n  Q4. Involving as it does an entire space-time interval, isn't this a\n  nonlocal ``theory''?\n\n  A4. Yes, indeed; it was explicitly designed that way. As you know from\n  Bell's theorem, no ``theory'' can agree with quantum mechanics unless\n  it is nonlocal in character. In effect, the TI is a hidden variables\n  theory as it postulates a real waves traveling in space-time.\n\n  Q5. What happens to OW's that are not ``absorbed'' ?\n\n  A5. Inasmuch as they do not stimulate a responsive CW, they just\n  continue to travel onward until they do. This does not present any\n  problems since in that case no energy or momentum or any other\n  physical observable is transferred.\n\n  Q6. How about all of the standard measurement thought experiments like\n  the EPR, Schrodinger's cat, Wigner's friend, and Renninger's negative-\n  result experiment?\n\n  A6. The interpretational difficulties with the latter three are due to\n  the necessity of deciding when the Copenhagen state reduction occurs.\n  As we saw above, in the TI there is no specific time when the\n  transaction is complete. The EPR is a completeness argument requiring\n  objective reality.  The TI supplies this as well; the OW and CW are\n  real waves, not waves of probability.\n\n  Q7. I am curious about more technical details. Can you give a further\n  reference?\n\n  A7. If you understand the theory of ``advanced'' and ``retarded''\n  waves (out of electromagnetism and optics), many of the details of TI\n  calculations can be found in: Reviews of Modern Physics, Vol. 58, July\n  1986, pp. 647-687 available on the WWW as: http://mist.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_toc.html 9.

Is this a real FAQ?\n\n  Paul Budnik paul@mtnmath.com\n\n  A FAQ is generally understood to be a reasonably objective set of\n  answers to frequently asked questions in a news group. In cases where\n  an issue is controversial the FAQ should include all credible opinions\n  and/or the consensus view of the news group.\n\n  Establishing factual accuracy is not easy. No consensus is possible on\n  interpretations of QM because many aspects of interpretations involve\n  metaphysical questions. My intention is that this be an objective\n  accurate FAQ that allows for the expression of all credible relevant\n  opinions.  I did not call it a FAQ until I had significant feedback\n  from the `sci.physics' group. I have responded to all criticism and\n  have made some corrections. Nonetheless there have been a couple of\n  complaints about this not being a real FAQ and there is one issue that\n  has not been resolved.\n\n  If anyone thinks there are technical errors in the FAQ please say what\n  you think the errors are. I will either fix the problem or try to\n  reach on a consensus with the help of the `sci.physics' group about\n  what is factually accurate.  I do not feel this FAQ should be limited\n  to noncontroversial issues.  A FAQ on measurement in quantum mechanics\n  should highlight and underscore the conceptual issues and problems in\n  the theory.\n\n  The one area that has been discussed and not resolved is the status of\n  locality in Everett's interpretation. Here is what I believe the facts\n  are.\n\n\n  Eberhard proved that any theory that reproduces the predictions of QM\n  is nonlocal[1]. This proof assumes contrafactual definiteness (CFD) or\n  that one could have done a different experiment and have gotten a\n  definite result. This assumption is widely used in statistical\n  arguments.  Here is what Eberhard means by nonlocal:\n\n\n     Let us consider two measuring apparata located in two different\n     places A and B. There is a knob a on apparatus A and a knob b on\n     apparatus B.  Since A and B are separated in space, it is\n     natural to think what will happen at A is independent of the\n     setting of knob b and vice versa.  The principles of relativity\n     seem to impose this point of view if the time at which the knobs\n     are set and the time of the measurements are so close that, in\n     the time laps, no light signal can travel from A to B and vice\n     versa. Then, no signal can inform a measurement apparatus of\n     what the knob setting on the other is. However, there are cases\n     in which the predictions of quantum theory make that\n     independence assumption impossible. If quantum theory is true,\n     there are cases in which the results of the measurements A will\n     depend on the setting of the knob b and/or the results of the\n     measurements in B will depend on the setting of the knob a.[1]\n\n  It is logically possible to deny CFD and thus to avoid Eberhard's\n  proof.  This assumption can be made in Everett's interpretation.\n  Everett's interpretation does not imply CFD is false and CFD can be\n  assumed false in other interpretations.  I do not think it is\n  reasonable to deny CFD in some experiments and not others but that is\n  a judgment call on which intelligent people can differ.\n\n  It is mathematically impossible to have a unitary relativistic wave\n  function from which one can compute probabilities that will violate\n  Bell's inequality. A unitary wave function does satisfy CFD and thus\n  is subject to Eberhard's proof. This is a problem for some advocates\n  of Everett who insist that only the wave function exists.  There is no\n  wave function consistent with both quantum mechanics and relativity\n  and it is mathematically impossible to construct such a function.\n  Quantum field theory requires a nonlocal and thus nonrelativistic\n  state model. The predications of quantum field theory are the same in\n  any frame of reference but the mechanisms that generate nonlocal\n  effects must operate in an absolute frame of reference. Quantum\n  uncertainty makes this seemingly paradoxical situation possible. There\n  is a nonlocal effect but we cannot tell if the effect went from A to B\n  or B to A because of quantum uncertainty. As a result the predictions\n  are the same in any frame of reference but any mechanism that produces\n  these predictions must be tied to an absolute frame of reference.\n\n  There is a certain Alice in Wonderland quality to arguments on these\n  issues. Many physicists claim that classical mathematics does not\n  apply to some aspects of quantum mechanics, yet there is no other\n  mathematics. The wave function model is a classical causal\n  deterministic model. The computation of probabilities from that model\n  is as well.  The aspect of quantum mechanics that one can claim lies\n  outside of classical mathematics is the interpretation of those\n  probabilities.  Most physicists believe these probabilities are\n  irreducible, i. e., do not come from a more fundamental deterministic\n  process the way probabilities do in classical physics. Because there\n  is no mathematical theory of irreducible probabilities one can invent\n  new metaphysics to interpret these probabilities and here is where the\n  problems and confusion rest.  Some physicists claim there is new\n  metaphysics and within this metaphysics quantum mechanics is local.\n\n  References:\n\n  P. H.

The talk is devoted to explaining how great and awesome the inflationary theory is, including the usual reasons it\u2019s believed by many to be correct: it explains the large-scale homogeneity of the universe (by causally connecting in the past regions that are unconnected after the inflationary period) and supposedly predicts a smoothed out geometry with an average mass density close to its critical point (that is, a universe with flat spatial sections). There\u2019s also some talk about eternal inflation and pocket universes, which i didn\u2019t understand well enough to comment on: this article by Guth himself is a good way to learn more.\nDr Guth is extremely happy about the fact that estimates for the ratio of the observed over the critical density (\n) have jumped during the last decade from the 0.2-0.3 range to a value almost exactly equal to 1, which corresponds to the flat model. The correction comes from taking bringing dark energy into the picture, and the second half of the talk is devoted to some speculations as to its mysterious origin. To Guth, the most plausible explanation is that this dark energy corresponds to the vacuum energy density (\n), but there\u2019s this little problem that quantum field theory predicts an infinite value for it. Even if you try to introduce an (arbitrary) ultraviolet cut in the calculation at the usual Plank energy, the value obtained is some 120 orders of magnitude greater than the observed one. String theory and the landscape to the rescue! Which of course explains nothing, in my opinion.\nGuth\u2019s last resort is the anthropic principle, according to which\nis so low because it\u2019s the only way intelligent (?) beings would be here to observe it, and then uses an analogy so broken that i\u2019m sure i\u2019m missing something obvious. It goes as follows: Kepler initially thought that the radius of the orbits of planets in the solar system should have values deducible from geometrical considerations alone, but, as we all know, that\u2019s not the case: their concrete values could be different just by changing the initial conditions leading to the formation of the solar system. So it is with\n: since we have no way of computing its unexpectedly low value, it must be that the reason for it is that we exist. This argument is so plainly wrong that, as i said, i\u2019m sure i\u2019m misunderstanding (perhaps one of my two or three readers will set the record straight in the comments).\nOther than that, and the fact that it feels at times like a commercial (including some arguments pretty close to straw men when he shows the curves matching the observations of the microwave background (without any mention, by the way, to the possible discrepancies for low terms of the multipolar expansion )), the talk is entertaining and gives a good, if quick, overview of commonly accepted wisdom on the field these days. So, if you have a grain of salt handy and don\u2019t mind a bit of hand-waving, just ignore my rants and go for it.\n(While you\u2019re at it, i\u2019ll be giving a try to last year\u2019s winner, Anton Zeilinger, and his talk on quantum information and the foundation of quantum mechanics ).\nTaking issue with String\u00a0Theory\nOctober 7, 2006\nWith the recent publication of Lee Smolin\u2019s and Peter Woit\u2019s books on the troubles of our theories of everything, every blogger in town seems to be talking about the crisis of modern fundamental physics (a.k.a. string theory and, so to speak, friends). Christine has just posted a list of recent posts on the subject. Like her, i\u2019m reading Smolin\u2019s book, courtesy of the publisher, and a review will eventually follow (once i find something to say about it that has not already been said!). In the meantime, i just wanted to add a few links to articles that i like on this pesky matter:\nJim\u2019s Stab at String Theory is a very interesting discussion by Jim Weatherall on why it doesn\u2019t really matters whether string theory is right. There you\u2019ll find also a video interview with Peter Woit, by John Horgan (who is not specially happy with ST, either).\nAmong the free contents of the latest Physics Today issue, Burton Richter takes no prisoners when it comes to describe what\u2019s wrong with all this super stuff.\nI find Richter\u2019s stabs, er, criticisms particularly compelling: his writing is clear and to the point, and his arguments are all but crisp and pungent. It\u2019s curious that, by contrast, Smolin\u2019s delicacy has actually augmented my curiosity on string theory (but i\u2019m just halfway reading his book, so let\u2019s better wait until i\u2019m done).\nOn the other hand, i\u2019m starting to be more and more in agreement with Weatherall\u2019s arguments on the irrelevance of this whole business. At the very least, i\u2019m trying to keep in mind that there\u2019s arguably much more to fundamental physics than this debate. Maybe it\u2019s time for some fresh air.\nNobody expects the Strings\u00a0Inquisition\nJune 13, 2006\nThe recent comments by you-know-who against the positive press that Peter Woit\u2019s book Not Even Wrong is receiving just reminded me (by some weird association of ideas) of this epoch-making gag by Monty Python. I was about to write an entry on my recently ordering this book and planning to read it on a trip next week, but now i\u2019m scared of confessing having bought it! (and, anyway, Christine Dantas has recently put quite nicely almost my exact feelings on this matter). Imagine, i might even like it, and got immediately classified as a crackpot and a nincompoop by the theoretical physics community!\nI\u2019m trying hard to respect string theory and theorists (and even plan on reading Zee, Weinberg and Zwiebach\u2019s books, already waiting on my shelf). Why, i even admire several string theorists. But it would help if someone told me that Motl is not the string community\u2019s spokesman. Or to read every now and then a bit of self-criticism from said community (something in the vein of Smolin\u2019s comments in, say, Three Roads to Quantum Gravity). For if the (so to speak) dialectic battles between those two are to be taken as the kind of discussion we theoretical physicists favour these days, poor Monty Python are just out of business. Paraphrasing Erwin Schrodinger, i wouldn\u2019t like it, and i would be sorry i ever had anything to do with it.\nUpdate: Christine\u2019s again right on the spot . And this is much, much closer to the kind of discussion i was asking for!\nLeibniz\u00a0space-times\nMay 27, 2006\nMore often than not, Lee Smolin\u2019s essays are engaging and thought provoking. I specially appreciate his willingness to tackle conceptual issues, often dismissed as philosophical or uninteresting by a great deal of the physics community (which, in my opinion, should know better). Also of note are his efforts to convey to non-specialists the key ideas and problems faced by modern physics, without unduly over-simplifications or dishonest hype.\nA case in point is his recent essay The Case for Background Independence , where the meaning, virtues and drawbacks of relationist theories of quantum gravity are explored in detail. More concretely, Smolin describes the close relationship between three key issues in fundamental physics, to wit:\nMust a quantum theory of gravity be background independent, or can there can be a sensible and successful background dependent approach?\nHow are the parameters of the standard models of physics and cosmology to be determined?\nCan a cosmological theory be formulated in the same language we use for descriptions of subsystems of the universe, or does the extension of physics from local to cosmological require new principles or a new formulation of quantum theory?\nThe article begins with a brief historical review of relationism, as understood by Leibniz and summarized in his principles of sufficient reason (there\u2019s always a rational cause for Nature\u2019s choices) and the identity of the indiscernible (entities with exactly the same properties are to be considered the same) [1]. These principles rule out absolute space-times (like Newton\u2019s) or a fixed Minkowskian background (like perturbative string theory), since they single out a preferred structure \u2018without reason\u2019, as do theories posing any number of free parameters (think of the much debated landscape) [2]. As is well known, Newton won the day back in the seventeenth century, until Mach\u2019s sharp criticism marked the resurgence of relationist ideas. Mach rejected Newtonian absolute space-time, favouring a purely relational definition of inertia [3], which ultimately would inspire Einstein in his quest for the general theory of relativity [4].\nSmolin\u2019s article continues with a careful definition, in modern terms, of relational space and time, and follows with a discussion of some current theories featuring background independence: general relativity, causal sets, loop quantum gravity, causal dynamical triangulation models and background independent approaches (by Smolin himself) to M-theory. In a nutshell, it is argued that any self-respecting relational theory should comply to three principles:\nThere is no background.\nThe fundamental properties of the elementary entities consist entirely in relationships between those elementary entities.\nThe relationships are not fixed, but evolve according to law. Time is nothing but changes in the relationships, and consists of nothing but their ordering.\nNone of the theories above passes without problems this litmus test of pure relationsm. Take for instance general relativity. To begin with the dimension, topology and differential structure of space-time are givens, and thus play the role of a background. And, on the other hand, only when we apply GR to a compact universe without boundary can we aspire to a relational view, since otherwise we would have arbitrary boundary conditions (partially) determining the structure of space-time. Once you abide to these preconditions, a proper interpretation of general covariance (in which you identify space-times related by arbitrary coordinate transformations) provides a relational description of space-time (for an in-depth discussion of the subtle interplay between gauge invariance and relationsm, see also this excellent article by Lusanna and Pari, and references therein). As a second example, loop quantum gravity is also background dependent: in this case, the topological space containing the spin-networks of the theory. Other than that, loops are an almost paradigmatic case of a relational description in terms of graphs, with nodes being the entities and edges representing their relationships.\nAfter his review of quantum gravity theories, Smolin takes issue with string theory. His subsequent train of thought heavily relies on the fact that relationism, or, more concretely, Leibniz\u2019s principle of the indiscernible, rules out space-times with global symmetries. For if we cannot distinguish this universe from one moved 10 feet to the left, we must identify the two situations, i.e., deny any meaning or reality to the underlying, symmetric structure. But, as is happens, the M-theory programme consists, broadly speaking, in maximizing the symmetry groups of the theories embodied in the desired unified description. More concretely, in background-dependent theories, the properties of elemental entities are described in terms of representations of symmetries of the background\u2019s vacuum state. Each of the five string theories embodied by M-string (should it exist!) has its own vacuum, related with each other via duality transformations (basically, compactifying spatial dimensions one way or the other one is able to jump from one string theory to the next). Thus, M-theory should be background independent (i.e., encompass different backgrounds), but, on the other hand, one expects that the unique unified theory will have the largest possible symmetry group consistent with the basic principles of physics, such as quantum theory and relativity. Smolin discusses some possible solutions this contradiction (which a lack, er, background to comment intelligently), including some sort of (as yet unknown) dynamical mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking (which would result in a Leibniz-compliant explanation for the actual properties\u2013such as masses and coupling constants\u2013that we find in our universe).\nAfter all the fuss, there is disappointingly little to be said about relationist unified theories [5]. Invoking again the principle of the indiscernible, Smolin rules out symmetries that would make (unified) identities undistinguishable (if two entities have the same relationships with the rest, they are the same entity). By the same token, a universe in thermal equilibrium is out of the question. Reassuringly, our universe is not, and the negative specific heat of gravitationally bound systems precludes its evolution to such an state. The case is then made (after casting evolution theory as a relationist one, which is OK by me) for Smolin\u2019s peculiar idea of cosmological natural selection. To my view, it is an overly speculative idea, if only for the fact that it depends on black holes giving rise to new universes when they collapse [6]. If that were the case, and provided that each new universe is created with random values for the free parameters of our theories, one would expect that a process similar to natural selection would lead to universes with its parameters tuned to favour a higher and higher number of black-holes (which seems to be the case in our universe). Nice as the idea is, i think we\u2019re a little far from real physics here.\nThe article closes with a short section on the cosmological constant problem (with the interesting observation than only casual set theory has predicted so far a realistic value ) and relational approaches to (cosmological) quantum theory. Again, the author adheres to non-orthodox ideas. This time, to recent proposals (see here and here ) of hidden-variable theories, albeit they have far better grounds than the reproducing universes idea. The possibility of a relational hidden-variable theory is argued for with a simple and somewhat compelling line of thought. In classical physics, the phase space of a system of N particles is described by a 6N variables, while a quantum mechanical state vector would depend on 3N variables. On the other hand, in a purely relational theory one would need to use N^2 variables, as these are the number of possible relations between N particles. These would be the hidden-variables completely (and non-locally) describing our particles, which would need statistical laws when using just 3N parameters.\nAn amazing journey, by all accounts.\n[1] See here for excellent (and free) editions of all relevant Leibniz works, including his Monadology , and here for commented excerpts of the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence.\n[2] See also here for an interesting take on Leibniz\u2019s principle under the light of G\u00f6del\u2019s and Turing\u2019s incompleteness theorems as further developed by Gregory Chaitin.\n[3] Julian Barbour\u2019s \u201cThe Discovery of Dynamics: A Study from a Machian Point of View of the Discovery and the Structure of Dynamical Theories\u201d is the definitive reference to know more about the history of the absolute/relative divide.

Smolin himself has many an interesting thing to say about Barbour\u2019s timeless Platonia.)\n[4] Barbour argues in his book that Einstein seems to have misunderstood Mach\u2019s discussions on the concept of inertia, taking it for the dynamical quantity entering Newton\u2019s second law instead of the inertial motion caused by space-time according to Newton\u2019s first law.\n[5] I\u2019m also a bit surprised by Smolin\u2019s uncritical acceptance of reductionism, which he simply considers, \u201cto a certain degree\u201d, as common-sense.\n[6] Tellingly, the only reference where this theory is developed is Smolin\u2019s popular science book \u201cThe Life of the Cosmos\u201d .\n"}, {"score": 2668.4585, "uuid": "01ffb750-04c0-5b6e-aee4-8f6aa4efccfa", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1109wb-92-10467", "target_hostname": "phys.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "https://phys.wordpress.com/category/quantum-gravity/", "page_rank": 1.9577304e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "<em>Quantum</em> Gravity \u00ab <em>physics</em> musings", "snippet": "So, if you have a grain of salt handy <em>and</em> don\u2019t mind a bit of hand-waving, just ignore my rants <em>and</em> go for it.

The talk is devoted to explaining how great and awesome the inflationary theory is, including the usual reasons it\u2019s believed by many to be correct: it explains the large-scale homogeneity of the universe (by causally connecting in the past regions that are unconnected after the inflationary period) and supposedly predicts a smoothed out geometry with an average mass density close to its critical point (that is, a universe with flat spatial sections). There\u2019s also some talk about eternal inflation and pocket universes, which i didn\u2019t understand well enough to comment on: this article by Guth himself is a good way to learn more.\nDr Guth is extremely happy about the fact that estimates for the ratio of the observed over the critical density (\n) have jumped during the last decade from the 0.2-0.3 range to a value almost exactly equal to 1, which corresponds to the flat model. The correction comes from taking bringing dark energy into the picture, and the second half of the talk is devoted to some speculations as to its mysterious origin. To Guth, the most plausible explanation is that this dark energy corresponds to the vacuum energy density (\n), but there\u2019s this little problem that quantum field theory predicts an infinite value for it. Even if you try to introduce an (arbitrary) ultraviolet cut in the calculation at the usual Plank energy, the value obtained is some 120 orders of magnitude greater than the observed one. String theory and the landscape to the rescue! Which of course explains nothing, in my opinion.\nGuth\u2019s last resort is the anthropic principle, according to which\nis so low because it\u2019s the only way intelligent (?) beings would be here to observe it, and then uses an analogy so broken that i\u2019m sure i\u2019m missing something obvious. It goes as follows: Kepler initially thought that the radius of the orbits of planets in the solar system should have values deducible from geometrical considerations alone, but, as we all know, that\u2019s not the case: their concrete values could be different just by changing the initial conditions leading to the formation of the solar system. So it is with\n: since we have no way of computing its unexpectedly low value, it must be that the reason for it is that we exist. This argument is so plainly wrong that, as i said, i\u2019m sure i\u2019m misunderstanding (perhaps one of my two or three readers will set the record straight in the comments).\nOther than that, and the fact that it feels at times like a commercial (including some arguments pretty close to straw men when he shows the curves matching the observations of the microwave background (without any mention, by the way, to the possible discrepancies for low terms of the multipolar expansion )), the talk is entertaining and gives a good, if quick, overview of commonly accepted wisdom on the field these days. So, if you have a grain of salt handy and don\u2019t mind a bit of hand-waving, just ignore my rants and go for it.\n(While you\u2019re at it, i\u2019ll be giving a try to last year\u2019s winner, Anton Zeilinger, and his talk on quantum information and the foundation of quantum mechanics ).\nTaking issue with String\u00a0Theory\nOctober 7, 2006\nWith the recent publication of Lee Smolin\u2019s and Peter Woit\u2019s books on the troubles of our theories of everything, every blogger in town seems to be talking about the crisis of modern fundamental physics (a.k.a. string theory and, so to speak, friends). Christine has just posted a list of recent posts on the subject. Like her, i\u2019m reading Smolin\u2019s book, courtesy of the publisher, and a review will eventually follow (once i find something to say about it that has not already been said!). In the meantime, i just wanted to add a few links to articles that i like on this pesky matter:\nJim\u2019s Stab at String Theory is a very interesting discussion by Jim Weatherall on why it doesn\u2019t really matters whether string theory is right. There you\u2019ll find also a video interview with Peter Woit, by John Horgan (who is not specially happy with ST, either).\nAmong the free contents of the latest Physics Today issue, Burton Richter takes no prisoners when it comes to describe what\u2019s wrong with all this super stuff.\nI find Richter\u2019s stabs, er, criticisms particularly compelling: his writing is clear and to the point, and his arguments are all but crisp and pungent. It\u2019s curious that, by contrast, Smolin\u2019s delicacy has actually augmented my curiosity on string theory (but i\u2019m just halfway reading his book, so let\u2019s better wait until i\u2019m done).\nOn the other hand, i\u2019m starting to be more and more in agreement with Weatherall\u2019s arguments on the irrelevance of this whole business. At the very least, i\u2019m trying to keep in mind that there\u2019s arguably much more to fundamental physics than this debate. Maybe it\u2019s time for some fresh air.\nNobody expects the Strings\u00a0Inquisition\nJune 13, 2006\nThe recent comments by you-know-who against the positive press that Peter Woit\u2019s book Not Even Wrong is receiving just reminded me (by some weird association of ideas) of this epoch-making gag by Monty Python. I was about to write an entry on my recently ordering this book and planning to read it on a trip next week, but now i\u2019m scared of confessing having bought it!

Formally, these reside in a complex separable Hilbert space (variously called the \" state space \" or the \"associated Hilbert space\" of the system) well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the projective space of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space . The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system; for example, the state space for position and momentum states is the space of square-integrable functions, while the state space for the spin of a single proton is just the product of two complex planes. Each observable is represented by a maximally Hermitian (precisely: by a self-adjoint ) linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. If the operator's spectrum is discrete, the observable can only attain those discrete eigenvalues.\nIn the formalism of quantum mechanics, the state of a system at a given time is described by a complex wave function , also referred to as state vector in a complex vector space . [11] This abstract mathematical object allows for the calculation of probabilities of outcomes of concrete experiments. For example, it allows one to compute the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus at a particular time. Contrary to classical mechanics, one can never make simultaneous predictions of conjugate variables , such as position and momentum, with accuracy. For instance, electrons may be considered to be located somewhere within a region of space, but with their exact positions being unknown. Contours of constant probability, often referred to as \"clouds\", may be drawn around the nucleus of an atom to conceptualize where the electron might be located with the most probability. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle quantifies the inability to precisely locate the particle given its conjugate momentum. [12]\nAccording to one interpretation, as the result of a measurement the wave function containing the probability information for a system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator representing the observable\u00a0\u2014 which explains the choice of Hermitian operators, for which all the eigenvalues are real. We can find the probability distribution of an observable in a given state by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is represented by the statement that the operators corresponding to certain observables do not commute .\nThe probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement. This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand. It was the central topic in the famous Bohr-Einstein debates , in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of thought experiments . In the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a \"measurement\" has been extensively studied. Newer interpretations of quantum mechanics have been formulated that do away with the concept of \"wavefunction collapse\"; see, for example, the relative state interpretation . The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wavefunctions become entangled , so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity. For details, see the article on measurement in quantum mechanics . [13] Generally, quantum mechanics does not assign definite values. Instead, it makes predictions using probability distributions ; that is, it describes the probability of obtaining possible outcomes from measuring an observable. Often these results are skewed by many causes, such as dense probability clouds [14] or quantum state nuclear attraction. [15] [16] Naturally, these probabilities will depend on the quantum state at the \"instant\" of the measurement. Hence, uncertainty is involved in the value. There are, however, certain states that are associated with a definite value of a particular observable. These are known as eigenstates of the observable (\"eigen\" can be translated from German as meaning inherent or characteristic). [17]\nIn the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of everything (every observable) as being in an eigenstate. Everything appears to have a definite position, a definite momentum, a definite energy, and a definite time of occurrence. However, quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values of a particle's position and momentum (since they are conjugate pairs ) or its energy and time (since they too are conjugate pairs); rather, it only provides a range of probabilities of where that particle might be given its momentum and momentum probability. Therefore, it is helpful to use different words to describe states having uncertain values and states having definite values (eigenstate). Usually, a system will not be in an eigenstate of the observable (particle) we are interested in. However, if one measures the observable, the wavefunction will instantaneously be an eigenstate (or generalised eigenstate) of that observable. This process is known as wavefunction collapse , a controversial and much debated process. [18] It involves expanding the system under study to include the measurement device. If one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement, one will be able to compute the probability of collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates. For example, the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wavefunction that is a wave packet centered around some mean position x0, neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum. When one measures the position of the particle, it is impossible to predict with certainty the result. [13] It is probable, but not certain, that it will be near x0, where the amplitude of the wave function is large. After the measurement is performed, having obtained some result x, the wave function collapses into a position eigenstate centered at x. [19]\nThe time evolution of a quantum state is described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation , in which the Hamiltonian (the operator corresponding to the total energy of the system) generates time evolution. The time evolution of wave functions is deterministic in the sense that, given a wavefunction at an initial time, it makes a definite prediction of what the wavefunction will be at any later time. [20]\nDuring a measurement , on the other hand, the change of the wavefunction into another one is not deterministic; it is unpredictable, i.e. random . A time-evolution simulation can be seen here. [21] [22] Wave functions can change as time progresses. An equation known as the Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes how wavefunctions change in time, a role similar to Newton's second law in classical mechanics. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation, applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle, predicts that the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity, like a classical particle with no forces acting on it. However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more uncertain. This also has the effect of turning position eigenstates (which can be thought of as infinitely sharp wave packets) into broadened wave packets that are no longer position eigenstates. [23]\nFig. 1: Probability densities corresponding to the wavefunctions of an electron in a hydrogen atom possessing definite energy levels (increasing from the top of the image to the bottom: n = 1, 2, 3, ...) and angular momentum (increasing across from left to right: s, p, d, ...). Brighter areas correspond to higher probability density in a position measurement. Wavefunctions like these are directly comparable to Chladni's figures of acoustic modes of vibration in classical physics and are indeed modes of oscillation as well: they possess a sharp energy and thus a keen frequency . The angular momentum and energy are quantized , and only take on discrete values like those shown (as is the case for resonant frequencies in acoustics).\nSome wave functions produce probability distributions that are constant, or independent of time, such as when in a stationary state of constant energy, time drops out of the absolute square of the wave function. Many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such \"static\" wave functions. For example, a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus , whereas in quantum mechanics it is described by a static, spherically symmetric wavefunction surrounding the nucleus ( Fig. 1 ). (Note that only the lowest angular momentum states, labeled s, are spherically symmetric). [24]\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation acts on the entire probability amplitude, not merely its absolute value. Whereas the absolute value of the probability amplitude encodes information about probabilities, its phase encodes information about the interference between quantum states. This gives rise to the wave-like behavior of quantum states. It turns out that analytic solutions of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation are only available for a small number of model Hamiltonians , of which the quantum harmonic oscillator , the particle in a box , the hydrogen molecular ion and the hydrogen atom are the most important representatives. Even the helium atom, which contains just one more electron than hydrogen, defies all attempts at a fully analytic treatment. There exist several techniques for generating approximate solutions. For instance, in the method known as perturbation theory one uses the analytic results for a simple quantum mechanical model to generate results for a more complicated model related to the simple model by, for example, the addition of a weak potential energy . Another method is the \"semi-classical equation of motion\" approach, which applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces weak deviations from classical behavior. The deviations can be calculated based on the classical motion. This approach is important for the field of quantum chaos .\nThere are numerous mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics. One of the oldest and most commonly used formulations is the transformation theory proposed by Cambridge theoretical physicist Paul Dirac , which unifies and generalizes the two earliest formulations of quantum mechanics, matrix mechanics (invented by Werner Heisenberg ) [25] [26] and wave mechanics (invented by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger ). [27] In this formulation, the instantaneous state of a quantum system encodes the probabilities of its measurable properties, or \" observables \". Examples of observables include energy , position , momentum , and angular momentum . Observables can be either continuous (e.g., the position of a particle) or discrete (e.g., the energy of an electron bound to a hydrogen atom). [28] An alternative formulation of quantum mechanics is Feynman 's path integral formulation , in which a quantum-mechanical amplitude is considered as a sum over histories between initial and final states; this is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of action principles in classical mechanics.\n[ edit ] Interactions with other scientific theories\nThe rules of quantum mechanics are fundamental; they assert that the state space of a system is a Hilbert space and that observables of that system are Hermitian operators acting on that space; they do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators. These can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system. An important guide for making these choices is the correspondence principle , which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical physics when a system moves to higher energies or, equivalently, larger quantum numbers (i.e. whereas a single particle exhibits a degree of randomness, in systems incorporating millions of particles averaging takes over and, at the high energy limit, the statistical probability of random behaviour approaches zero). In other words, classical mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large systems. This \"high energy\" limit is known as the classical or correspondence limit. One can even start from an established classical model of a particular system, and attempt to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit.\nUnsolved problems in physics\nIn the correspondence limit of quantum mechanics: Is there a preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics? How does the quantum description of reality, which includes elements such as the \" superposition of states\" and \" wavefunction collapse \", give rise to the reality we perceive?\nWhen quantum mechanics was originally formulated, it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was non-relativistic classical mechanics . For instance, the well-known model of the quantum harmonic oscillator uses an explicitly non-relativistic expression for the kinetic energy of the oscillator, and is thus a quantum version of the classical harmonic oscillator .\nEarly attempts to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved the replacement of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a covariant equation such as the Klein-Gordon equation or the Dirac equation . While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles. A fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of quantum field theory , which applies quantization to a field rather than a fixed set of particles. The first complete quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics , provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction . The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems. A simpler approach, one employed since the inception of quantum mechanics, is to treat charged particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical electromagnetic field . For example, the elementary quantum model of the hydrogen atom describes the electric field of the hydrogen atom using a classical\nCoulomb potential . This \"semi-classical\" approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role, such as in the emission of photons by charged particles .\nQuantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have been developed. The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called quantum chromodynamics , and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles: quarks and gluons . The weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory known as electroweak theory , by the physicists Abdus Salam , Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg . These three men shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for this work. [29]\nIt has proven difficult to construct quantum models of gravity , the remaining fundamental force . Semi-classical approximations are workable, and have led to predictions such as Hawking radiation . However, the formulation of a complete theory of quantum gravity is hindered by apparent incompatibilities between general relativity , the most accurate theory of gravity currently known, and some of the fundamental assumptions of quantum theory. The resolution of these incompatibilities is an area of active research, and theories such as string theory are among the possible candidates for a future theory of quantum gravity.\nClassical mechanics has been extended into the complex domain , and complex classical mechanics exhibits behaviours similar to quantum mechanics. [30]\n[ edit ] Quantum mechanics and classical physics\nPredictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy. According to the correspondence principle between classical and quantum mechanics, all objects obey the laws of quantum mechanics, and classical mechanics is just an approximation for large systems (or a statistical quantum mechanics of a large collection of particles). The laws of classical mechanics thus follow from the laws of quantum mechanics as a statistical average at the limit of large systems or large quantum numbers . [31] However, chaotic systems do not have good quantum numbers, and quantum chaos studies the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions in these systems.\nQuantum coherence is an essential difference between classical and quantum theories, and is illustrated by the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox . Quantum interference involves adding together probability amplitudes , whereas classical waves infer that there is an adding together of intensities. For microscopic bodies, the extension of the system is much smaller than the coherence length , which gives rise to long-range entanglement and other nonlocal phenomena characteristic of quantum systems. [32] Quantum coherence is not typically evident at macroscopic scales, although an exception to this rule can occur at extremely low temperatures, when quantum behavior can manifest itself on more macroscopic scales (see Bose-Einstein condensate and Quantum machine ). This is in accordance with the following observations:\nMany macroscopic properties of a classical system are a direct consequences of the quantum behavior of its parts. For example, the stability of bulk matter (which consists of atoms and molecules which would quickly collapse under electric forces alone), the rigidity of solids, and the mechanical, thermal, chemical, optical and magnetic properties of matter are all results of the interaction of electric charges under the rules of quantum mechanics. [33]\nWhile the seemingly exotic behavior of matter posited by quantum mechanics and relativity theory become more apparent when dealing with extremely fast-moving or extremely tiny particles, the laws of classical Newtonian physics remain accurate in predicting the behavior of the vast majority of large objects\u2014of the order of the size of large molecules and bigger\u2014at velocities much smaller than the velocity of light . [34]\n[ edit ] Relativity and quantum mechanics\nMain articles: Quantum gravity and Theory of everything\nEven with the defining postulates of both Einstein's theory of general relativity and quantum theory being indisputably supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence and while they do not directly contradict each other theoretically (at least with regard to primary claims), they are resistant to being incorporated within one cohesive model. [35]\nEinstein himself is well known for rejecting some of the claims of quantum mechanics. While clearly contributing to the field, he did not accept the more philosophical consequences and interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as the lack of deterministic causality (he is famously quoted as saying in response to this aspect, \"My God does not play with dice\") and the assertion that a single subatomic particle can occupy numerous areas of space at one time. He also was the first to notice some of the apparently exotic consequences of entanglement and used them to formulate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox , in the hope of showing that quantum mechanics had unacceptable implications. This was 1935, but in 1964 it was shown by John Bell (see Bell inequality ) that, although Einstein was correct in identifying seemingly paradoxical implications of quantum mechanical nonlocality , these implications could be experimentally tested. Alain Aspect's initial experiments in 1982, and many subsequent experiments since, have verified quantum entanglement.\nAccording to the paper of J. Bell and the Copenhagen interpretation (the common interpretation of quantum mechanics by physicists since 1927), and contrary to Einstein's ideas, quantum mechanics was not at the same time\na \"realistic\" theory\nand a local theory.\nThe Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox shows in any case that there exist experiments by which one can measure the state of one particle and instantaneously change the state of its entangled partner, although the two particles can be an arbitrary distance apart; however, this effect does not violate causality , since no transfer of information happens. Quantum entanglement is at the basis of quantum cryptography , with high-security commercial applications in banking and government.\nGravity is negligible in many areas of particle physics, so that unification between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not an urgent issue in those applications. However, the lack of a correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in cosmology and physicists' search for an elegant \" theory of everything \". Thus, resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of twentieth- and twenty-first-century physics. Many prominent physicists, including Stephen Hawking , have labored in the attempt to discover a theory underlying everything, combining not only different models of subatomic physics, but also deriving the universe's four forces\u00a0\u2014the strong force , electromagnetism , weak force , and gravity \u2014 from a single force or phenomenon. While Stephen Hawking was initially a believer in the Theory of Everything, after considering G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem , concluded that one was not obtainable, and stated such publicly in his lecture, \"G\u00f6del and the end of physics\" in 2002. [36] One of the leaders in this field is Edward Witten , a theoretical physicist who formulated the groundbreaking M-theory , which is an attempt at describing the supersymmetrical based string theory .\n[ edit ] Attempts at a unified field theory\nMain article: Grand unified theory\nThe quest to unify the fundamental forces through quantum mechanics is still ongoing. Quantum electrodynamics (or \"quantum electromagnetism\"), which is currently (in the perturbative regime at least) the most accurately tested physical theory, [37] [ unreliable source ](blog) has been successfully merged with the weak nuclear force into the electroweak force and work is currently being done to merge the electroweak and strong force into the electrostrong force . Current predictions state that at around 1014 GeV the three aforementioned forces are fused into a single unified field, [38] Beyond this \"grand unification,\" it is speculated that it may be possible to merge gravity with the other three gauge symmetries, expected to occur at roughly 1019 GeV. However\u00a0\u2014 and while special relativity is parsimoniously incorporated into quantum electrodynamics\u00a0\u2014 the expanded general relativity , currently the best theory describing the gravitation force, has not been fully incorporated into quantum theory.\nMain article: Interpretations of quantum mechanics\nSince its inception, the many counter-intuitive results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debate and many interpretations . Even fundamental issues such as Max Born 's basic rules concerning probability amplitudes and probability distributions took decades to be appreciated by the society and leading scientists.\nRichard Feynman said, \"I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.\" [39]\nThe Copenhagen interpretation , due largely to the Danish theoretical physicist Niels Bohr , is the interpretation of the quantum mechanical formalism most widely accepted amongst physicists. According to it, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but instead must be considered to be a final renunciation of the classical ideal of causality. In this interpretation, it is believed that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the complementarity nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations.\nAlbert Einstein , himself one of the founders of quantum theory, disliked this loss of determinism in measurement . (A view paraphrased as \"God does not play dice with the universe.\") Einstein held that there should be a local hidden variable theory underlying quantum mechanics and that, consequently, the present theory was incomplete. He produced a series of objections to the theory, the most famous of which has become known as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox . John Bell showed that the EPR paradox led to experimentally testable differences between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories. Experiments have been performed confirming the accuracy of quantum mechanics, thus demonstrating that the physical world cannot be described by local realistic theories. [40] The Bohr-Einstein debates provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an epistemological point of view.\nThe Everett many-worlds interpretation , formulated in 1956, holds that all the possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes. [41] This is not accomplished by introducing some new axiom to quantum mechanics, but on the contrary by removing the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet: All the possible consistent states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus (including the observer) are present in a real physical (not just formally mathematical, as in other interpretations) quantum superposition . Such a superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an entangled state . While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we can observe only the universe, i.e. the consistent state contribution to the mentioned superposition, we inhabit. Everett's interpretation is perfectly consistent with John Bell 's experiments and makes them intuitively understandable. However, according to the theory of quantum decoherence , the parallel universes will never be accessible to us. This inaccessibility can be understood as follows: Once a measurement is done, the measured system becomes entangled with both the physicist who measured it and a huge number of other particles, some of which are photons flying away towards the other end of the universe; in order to prove that the wave function did not collapse one would have to bring all these particles back and measure them again, together with the system that was measured originally. This is completely impractical, but even if one could theoretically do this, it would destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place (including the physicist's memory).[ citation needed ]\n[ edit ] Applications\nQuantum mechanics had enormous [42] success in explaining many of the features of our world. The individual behaviour of the subatomic particles that make up all forms of matter \u2014 electrons , protons , neutrons , photons and others\u2014can often only be satisfactorily described using quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics has strongly influenced the string theory , a candidate for a theory of everything (see reductionism ) and the multiverse hypothesis.\nQuantum mechanics is important for understanding how individual atoms combine covalently to form chemicals or molecules. The application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is known as quantum chemistry . (Relativistic) quantum mechanics can in principle mathematically describe most of chemistry. Quantum mechanics can provide quantitative insight into ionic and covalent bonding processes by explicitly showing which molecules are energetically favorable to which others, and by approximately how much. [43] Most of the calculations performed in computational chemistry rely on quantum mechanics. [44]\nA working mechanism of a resonant tunneling diode device, based on the phenomenon of quantum tunneling through the potential barriers.\nMuch of modern technology operates at a scale where quantum effects are significant. Examples include the laser , the transistor (and thus the microchip ), the electron microscope , and magnetic resonance imaging . The study of semiconductors led to the invention of the diode and the transistor , which are indispensable for modern electronics .\nResearchers are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating quantum states. Efforts are being made to develop quantum cryptography , which will allow guaranteed secure transmission of information . A more distant goal is the development of quantum computers , which are expected to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical computers . Another active research topic is quantum teleportation , which deals with techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances.\nQuantum tunneling is vital in many devices, even in the simple light switch , as otherwise the electrons in the electric current could not penetrate the potential barrier made up of a layer of oxide. Flash memory chips found in USB drives use quantum tunneling to erase their memory cells.\nQuantum mechanics primarily applies to the atomic regimes of matter and energy, but some systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects on a large scale; superfluidity (the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near absolute zero) is one well-known example. Quantum theory also provides accurate descriptions for many previously unexplained phenomena such as black body radiation and the stability of electron orbitals . It has also given insight into the workings of many different biological systems , including smell receptors and protein structures . [45] Recent work on photosynthesis has provided evidence that quantum correlations play an essential role in this most fundamental process of the plant kingdom. [46] Even so, classical physics often can be a good approximation to results otherwise obtained by quantum physics, typically in circumstances with large numbers of particles or large quantum numbers.\n[ edit ] Free particle\nFor example, consider a free particle . In quantum mechanics, there is wave-particle duality so the properties of the particle can be described as the properties of a wave. Therefore, its quantum state can be represented as a wave of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a wave function . The position and momentum of the particle are observables . The Uncertainty Principle states that both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be measured with full precision at the same time. However, one can measure the position alone of a moving free particle creating an eigenstate of position with a wavefunction that is very large (a Dirac delta ) at a particular position x and zero everywhere else. If one performs a position measurement on such a wavefunction, the result x will be obtained with 100% probability (full certainty). This is called an eigenstate of position (mathematically more precise: a generalized position eigenstate ( eigendistribution )). If the particle is in an eigenstate of position then its momentum is completely unknown. On the other hand, if the particle is in an eigenstate of momentum then its position is completely unknown. [47] In an eigenstate of momentum having a plane wave form, it can be shown that the wavelength is equal to h/p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the eigenstate . [48]\n3D confined electron wave functions for each eigenstate in a Quantum Dot. Here, rectangular and triangular-shaped quantum dots are shown. Energy states in rectangular dots are more \u2018s-type\u2019 and \u2018p-type\u2019. However, in a triangular dot the wave functions are mixed due to confinement symmetry.\n"}, {"score": 2657.8154, "uuid": "0d9b8e13-b10a-5c50-80a4-3e3ff4a4e229", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1407wb-02-16747", "target_hostname": "www.projects.science.uu.nl", "target_uri": "http://www.projects.science.uu.nl/igg/publications/time.html", "page_rank": 1.1718971e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Time in <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>", "snippet": "Much of <em>the</em> confusion about time in <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em> has been caused by not making a proper distinction, in classical as well as in <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em>, <em>between</em> position-variables of particles <em>and</em> coordinates of points of space.", "explanation": null, "document": "Institute for History and Foundations of Science, Utrecht University, The Netherlands\nAbstract\nTime is often said to play in quantum mechanics an essentially different role from position: whereas position is represented by a Hermitian operator, time is represented by a c-number. This discrepancy has been found puzzling and has given rise to a vast literature and many efforts at a solution. In this paper it is argued that the discrepancy is only apparent and that there is nothing in the formalism of (standard) quantum mechanics that forces us to treat position and time differently. The apparent problem is caused by the dominant role point particles play in physics and can be traced back to classical mechanics.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nFrom the early days, the role time plays in quantum mechanics has caused worries. Thus, von Neumann, in his famous book, complains:\n\"First of all we must admit that this objection points at an essential weakness which is, in fact, the chief weakness of quantum mechanics: its non-relativistic character, which distinguishes the time t from the three space coordinates x,y,z, and presupposes an objective simultaneity concept. In fact, while all other quantities (especially those x,y,z closely connected with t by the Lorentz transformation) are represented by operators, there corresponds to the time an ordinary number-parameter t, just as in classical mechanics.\" It is true, of course, that elementary quantum mechanics is not relativistic, but it is not true that the three space coordinates are operators in quantum mechanics.\nSeventy years later little seems to have changed when we read: \"Moreover, space and time are treated very differently in quantum mechanics. The spatial co-ordinates are operators, whereas time is a parameter \"\nMost textbooks of the intervening period tell us that time is exceptional in quantum mechanics and many efforts to deal with this problem have appeared in the literature.\nIn the following I will show that time does not pose a special problem for quantum mechanics.\nII. TIME IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS\nQuantum mechanics was modeled on classical Hamiltonian mechanics. In Hamiltonian mechanics a physical system is described by N pairs of canonical conjugate dynamical variables, Q k and P k , which satisfy the Poisson-bracket relations:\n{Q k , P l}\u00a0= d k l ; {Q k , Ql}\u00a0=\u00a0{P k , P l}\u00a0= 0.\nThese variables define a point of the 2N-dimensional so-called 'phase space' of the system. The time evolution of the system is generated by the Hamiltonian, a function of the canonical variables, H\u00a0=\u00a0H(Q k , P k) :\ndQk/dt = {Q k , H} , dP k/dt = {P k , H}.\n(We assume that H does not explicitly depend on time.)\nThe Qk and P k are generalized variables; they need not be positions and momenta, but may be angles, angular momenta, et cetera. However, if the system is a system of point particles the canonical variables are usually taken to be the positions q n and momenta pn of the particles (three-vectors are in bold type and the subscript denotes the n-th particle). Let us consider the relation of this scheme with space and time.\nIn all of physics, with the exception of Einstein's Theory of Gravity (General Relativity), physical systems are supposed to be situated in a three-dimensional Euclidean space. The points of this space will be given by Cartesian coordinates x = (x,y,z). Together with the time parameter t they form the coordinates of a continuous, independently given, space-time background. How the existence of this space and time is to be justified is an important and difficult problem into which I will not enter; I just take this assumption as belonging to the standard formulation of classical and quantum mechanics and of special relativity.\nThe (3+1)-dimensional space-time must be sharply distinguished from the 2N-dimensional phase space of the system, and the space-time coordinates (x,t) must be sharply distinguished from the dynamical variables (Q k, P k) characterizing material systems in space-time. In particular, the position variable q of a point particle must be distinguished from the coordinate x of the space-point the particle occupies, although we have the numerical relation: qx =\u00a0x, qy =\u00a0y, qz =\u00a0z. A point particle is a material system having a mass, a position, a velocity, an acceleration, while x is the coordinate of a fixed point of empty space. We will see that mixing up q and x is at the very root of the problem of time in quantum mechanics!\nA vital role is played in physics by the symmetries space and time are supposed to possess. It is assumed that three-dimensional space is isotropic (rotation symmetric) and homogeneous (translation symmetric) and that there is translation symmetry in time. In special relativity the space-time symmetry is enlarged by Lorentz transformations which mix x and t, transforming them as the components of a four-vector. (In a relativistic context I shall write 'spacetime' in stead of space-time.)\nFor the following it is important to note that individual physical systems in space-time need not show these symmetries; only the physical laws, that is the totality of physically allowed situations and processes, must show them. A given physical system need not be rotation invariant, and a position variable of a physical system need not be part of a four-vector.\nThe generators of translations in space and time are the total momentum P and the total energy H, respectively. The generator of space rotations is the total angular momentum J. We shall in particular be interested in the behavior of dynamical variables under translations in time and space. For an infinitesimal translation d t in time we have:\n(1) d Q k = {Q k , H}d t , d P k = {P k , H}d t ,\nand for an infinitesimal translation d a in space:\n(2) d Q k = {Q k , P}.d a, d P k = {P k , P}.d a.\nAt this point one may wonder why the Hamiltonian, the generator of time translations, i.e. of the time evolution of the system, is so much more prominent in classical mechanics than is the total momentum, the generator of translations in space. The reason for this is that the dynamical variables of the systems which are traditionally studied in classical mechanics, namely particles and rigid bodies, transform trivially under space translations. For example, for a system of particles, a space translation a\n(3) x \u00ae x + a , t \u00ae t ,\ninduces the simple transformation\n(4) q n \u00ae q n + a , p n \u00ae p n ,\nof the canonical variables. The infinitesimal form of (4) is d q n= d a; d p n = 0 and, comparing this with (2), we find the simple relations:\n{qn,i , Pj} = d ij , \u00a0\u00a0{pn,i , Pj}\u00a0=\u00a00 ; (i, j = x,y,z),\nwith the obvious solution P = S p n.\nIn case there is only one particle and one space dimension, this becomes:\n(5) {q , P}\u00a0=\u00a01, {p , P}\u00a0=\u00a00.\nThe simplicity of behavior under space translations shown by a point particle is not a general feature of the theory. If the physical system is a field, like e.g. an electromagnetic field strength or the density distribution in a fluid, the effect of a translation in space may be as non-trivial as the effect of a translation in time and H and P are equally important. In relativity theory, H and P are combined into the components of a four-vector.\nThe great similarity between the behavior under space translations (and rotations) of the position q of a point particle and the coordinate x of a point of three-dimensional space obscures the conceptual difference between the two, and the wide-spread use of the notation x for the position of a particle has greatly added to this confusion. In many discussions in classical mechanics an explicit distinction between x and q is even never made. Although ignoring the distinction may be innocent when it is sufficiently clear what is meant, it has, nevertheless, caused important misunderstandings of a general kind of which we will see examples here and in the following section.\nIn relativity theory the coordinates x, t transform as the components of a Lorentz four-vector. This has led people into believing that the position q of a particle should also be part of a four-vector with the time coordinate t as the fourth component. But q is a dynamical variable belonging to a material system whereas t is a universal spacetime coordinate. No one would think of adding t to the position variables of an arbitrary physical system, say a rigid body, to form a four-vector. It is only the great resemblance of a point particle to a space point which has misled people in this case. Already the case of a system consisting of several particles should be eye-opening here: in this case one would have to combine the very same t with all position variables.\nAs remarked above, a symmetry of spacetime does not imply the same symmetry of every physical system in spacetime. The point particle is a case in point. It simply does not possess a dynamical variable which may be combined with its position variable to form a four-vector. The position of a point particle is an essentially non-covariant concept. (Its momentum and energy, on the other hand, do form a four-vector.)\nAnother confusion, possibly related to the above one, lies at the root of efforts to include the time parameter t in the set of canonical variables as the partner conjugate to H. Again, since H and t differ conceptually in the same way as do q and t, such efforts are misconceived. In fact, H, being a given function of the original canonical variables, is not an independent canonical variable. Such a manoeuvre, therefore, implies a severe departure from the original scheme. Had the roles of x and P, the analogues of t and H, been more clearly recognized in classical mechanics, the temptation to add t to the canonical variables, while leaving x alone, would probably not have arisen.\nTime as a dynamical variable\nThe above served to stress the conceptual difference between the space-time coordinates and the dynamical variables of physical systems in space-time. In particular, the universal time coordinate t should not be mixed with dynamical position variables. But do physical systems exist that have a dynamical variable which resembles the time coordinate t in the same way as the position variable q of a point particle resembles the space coordinate x? The answer is yes! Such systems are clocks. A clock stands, ideally, in the same simple relation to the universal time coordinate t as a point particle stands to the universal space coordinate x. We may generally define an ideal clock as a physical system which has a dynamical variable which behaves under time translations in the same way as the time coordinate t. Such a variable, which we shall call a \"clock-variable\" or, more generally, a \"time-variable\", may be a pointer position or an angle or even a momentum. Just as a position variable indicates the position of a system in space, a clock-variable indicates the 'position' of a system in time. The closest analogue to (3) and (4) would be a linear clock-variable q with a conjugate momentum h such that a time translation\n(6) x \u00ae x , t \u00ae t + t\ninduces the simple transformation\n(7) h \u00ae h , q \u00ae q +t .\nComparing the infinitesimal form of this transformation with (1), we find:\n(8) {h , H} = 0, {q , H} = 1,\nwhich is the analog of (5) for time-variables.\nThe simplest solution of (8) is H(q ,h ) = h . This is analogous to the case of a single particle where the total momentum P(q,p) coincides with the momentum p. The equation of motion d/dt q =\u00a0{q , H}\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0has the solution q =\u00a0t which is the analogue of the relation q = x for a point particle.\nA model of a linear clock is provided by a particle moving in a constant force field. The momentum of the particle is a linear function of t and furnishes a time-variable. More precisely, starting from the Hamiltonian H(q, p)\u00a0= p2/2m\u00a0-\u00a0Kq of the particle in the field K, we go over to the variables q , h by the canonical transformation:\nq \u00ae q = p/K , p \u00ae h =H= p2/2m\u00a0-\u00a0Kq.\nThen, {q, p}\u00a0=\u00a0{q , h }\u00a0=\u00a01, and H(q ,h ) = h . It follows that d/dt q =\u00a01.\nNote that H is unbounded: it may take on any real value.\nActual clocks are not ideal in the sense of (8); in fact, most real clocks like e.g. a pendulum clock or a quartz clock are not even continuous indicators of time. What the example purports to show is that the Hamiltonian formalism allows for the existence of systems satisfying (8), playing the same role with respect to H and t as point particles do with respect to P and x.\nThe cyclic clock-variable corresponding to our linear clock is an angle variable f with conjugate momentum L and Hamiltonian H(f ,L)\u00a0= L. Here f = t (mod 2p ). We shall come back to these examples in section IV.\nWe conclude that in classical physics a sharp distinction must be made between the universal space-time coordinates and the dynamical variables of specific physical systems situated in space-time. Particles and clocks are physical systems having dynamical variables which behave in much the same way as the space and time coordinates, respectively, and may thus serve to indicate the 'position' of the system in space and in time. Point particles and clocks are non-covariant concepts. If one is to look for physical systems which transform covariantly under relativistic space-time transformations one must consider fields.\nIII. TIME IN QUANTUM MECHANICS\nIn quantum mechanics the situation is essentially not different. The theory supposes a fixed, unquantized space-time background, the points of which are given by c-number coordinates x, t. The space-time symmetry transformations are expressed in terms of these coordinates.\nDynamical variables of physical systems, on the other hand, are quantized: they are replaced by self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space. All formulas of the preceding section remain valid if the Poisson-brackets are replaced by commutators according to {\u00a0,\u00a0} \u00ae (ih ) -1 [\u00a0,\u00a0]. In particular, the canonical variables are replaced by operators satisfying the commutation relations:\n(9) [Qk , P l]\u00a0= ih d kl ; [Qk , Ql]\u00a0=\u00a0[P k , P l]\u00a0= 0.\n(In this section, symbols representing dynamical variables are supposed to be operators.)\nThus, for a point particle,\n(10) [qi , pj] = ih d i\u00a0j ; [qi , qj]\u00a0=\u00a0[pi , pj]\u00a0= 0,\nwhere (i,j = x,y,z) denote the Cartesian components of the position q and momentum p of the particle. These relations have the well-known representation where q is the multiplication operator and p the corresponding differentation operator. Both these operators are unbounded and have the full real axis as their spectrum. However, if the position wavefunctions are required to obey periodic boundary conditions the eigenvalues of p become discrete, and if the position wavefunctions are required to vanish at the endpoints of a finite interval (particle in a box) a self-adjoint momentum operator does not even exist. Corresponding statements hold for q. Similarly, since the wavefunctions of an angle variable must obey a periodic boundary condition, the eigenvalues of the corresponding angular momentum operator are discrete. Discrete energy eigenvalues are of course the hallmark of quantum mechanics. Nobody would conclude from these facts that something is totally wrong with the notions of position, momentum, angular momentum or energy in quantum mechanics. One should keep this in mind when we discuss quantum mechanical time-operators.\nBut first, let us point out some of the confusions which have established themselves in standard presentations of quantum mechanics as a result of mixing up q and x.\nMost texts on elementary quantum mechanics start by considering a single point particle. The particle position is commonly denoted x (instead of q) and the time-dependent wave function is written y (x, t). This notation is misleading in several ways. It gives the false impression that the wave function is just an ordinary wave in three-dimensional space, an impression which is reinforced by the usual discussions of double slit interference, quantum tunneling, et cetera. It seems that even von Neumann, in his quoted statement, has fallen victim to this notation. However, contrary to an ordinary field, like e.g. the electromagnetic field, y is a highly abstract entity, living in an abstract configuration space, carrying no energy and momentum but only information about the results of measurements. Furthermore, the notation suggests that x and t are quantities of the same kind which leads to the question why t, the universal time coordinate, is not an operator like x. The notation y (q, t) for the wave function, where q denotes an eigenvalue of the position operator, would certainly have made this a less obvious question to ask.\nAgain, the idea, criticized in the previous section, that t can be seen as the canonical variable conjugate to the Hamiltonian, leads one to expect t to obey the canonical commutation relation [t,H]\u00a0= ih . But if t is the universal time operator it should have continuous eigenvalues running from -\u00a5 to +\u00a5 and, from this, the same would follow for the eigenvalues of any H. But we know that discrete eigenvalues of H may occur. From this Pauli concluded: \"that the introduction of an operator t is basically forbidden and the time must necessarily be considered as an ordinary number (\"c-number\").\".\nThus, the 'unsolvable' problem of time in quantum mechanics has arisen.\nNote that it is crucial for this argument that t is supposed to be a universal operator, valid for all systems: according to Pauli the introduction of such an operator is basically forbidden because some systems have discrete energy eigenvalues.\nFrom our previous discussion it should be clear that the universal time coordinate t is the partner of the space coordinates x. Neither the space coordinates nor the time coordinate is quantized in standard quantum mechanics. So, the above problem simply doesn't exist! If one is to look for a time operator in quantum mechanics one should not try to quantize the universal time coordinate but consider time-like (in the literal sense) dynamical variables of specific physical systems, i.e. clocks. Since a clock-variable is an ordinary dynamical variable quantization should not, in principle, be especially problematic. One must, however, be prepared to encounter the well-known quantum effects mentioned above: a dynamical system may have a continuous time-variable, or a discrete one or no time-variable at all. But this invalidates the notion of time in quantum mechanics as little as does, say, the discreteness of the energy eigenvalues of a system invalidates the notion of energy. Let us now turn to the quantum version of the clocks considered in section II.\nIV. QUANTUM CLOCKS\nIn section II we have characterized ideal time-variables by their behavior under time translations, i.e. by relations (8). The analogous relations for the corresponding quantum mechanical operators are\n(11) [h , H] = 0, [q , H] = ih .\nThe linear quantum clock\nRelations (11) are satisfied by the quantum version of our simple linear clock if we take q\nto be the multiplication operator, h = -ih d/dq and H\u00a0= h . The operators q and h satisfy [q ,h ]\u00a0= ih . The spectrum of q , h and H is the whole real axis.\nIt is illuminating to compare this result with Pauli's argument above. Our q resembles the universal time parameter t as well as can be and our H has indeed continuous eigenvalues. But this does not imply that the Hamiltonians of other physical systems must have continuous eigenvalues also. It only means that in such systems time-operators either do not exist or cannot resemble t as closely as does our linear clock (although they can come pretty close, as we shall see). It is the supposed universality of the time-operator with is crucial for the validity of Pauli's argument.\nBut here another objection must be mentioned. Most physically interesting systems have Hamiltonians that are bounded from below. In such systems a time-operator having the real axis as its spectrum does not exist. Now, it is sometimes asserted that the Hamiltonian of real physical systems must be bounded from below in order to guarantee the stability of the system. The archetypical example is, of course, the Rutherford atom whose very instability gave rise to Bohr's atomic theory and to the development of modern quantum mechanics. However, the instability of the Rutherford atom is caused by its interaction with the electromagnetic field which allows it to dissipate its energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Without this interaction the atom would be stable because of the conservation of energy. Similarly, in quantum mechanics, the stationary states of the hydrogen atom are indeed stationary as long as the interaction of the atom with the electromagnetic field is not taken into account. So, for an isolated system, the demand that its Hamiltonian has a lower bound is not at all necessary. Thus, from the point of view of the quantum mechanical formalism our linear clock is a completely bona fide system.\nIt is ironic that the demand that H be bounded from below precludes the existence of an acceptable particle position operator in relativistic quantum mechanics (cf. section V).\nThe continuous cyclic quantum clock\nThis clock is characterized by an angle-variablef which will play the role of time-variable.\nIn quantum mechanics f is represented by an operator F . The Hilbert space in the angle representation consists of the square-integrable functions f of f on the interval [0,2p ]. The operators of angle and angular momentum are represented by (h =1):\nF f(f ) = f f(f ),\nL f(f ) = -i\nf(f ).\nThe operator F is self-adjoint on the whole Hilbert space, whereas L is self-adjoint on the subspace of the square-integrable, differentiable functions satisfying f(0) =\u00a0f(2p ). These operators have complete, orthonormal sets of generalized eigenstates |f \u00f1 and |m\u00f1 :\nF |f \u00f1 = f |f \u00f1 , \u00e1 f |f \u00a2 \u00f1 = d (f -f \u00a2 ),\nL |m\u00f1 = m|m\u00f1 , \u00e1 m|m\u00a2 \u00f1 = d m,m\u00a2 ,\nwhere the eigenvalue f runs through the interval [0,2p ] and m\u00a0= 0,\u00a01,\u00a02,\nIn the f -representation the states |f \u00f1 and |m\u00f1 are represented by the wavefunctions \u00e1 f |f \u00a2 \u00f1 = d (f -f \u00a2 ) and \u00e1 f |m\u00f1 =\u00a0(2p )- e-imf , respectively. The situation is very similar to that of the linear clock except for the fact that the interval on which the functions f(f ) are defined is finite. In particular, we have\n(12) |f \u00f1 = (2p )-\n|m\u00f1 ,\nwhere the sum runs over all values of m.\nThe dynamics of the system is introduced by specifying a Hamiltonian; we put H\u00a0= w L, where w is a constant frequency.\nThe operator of translations in time is U(t) = e-iHt, and with the help of (12) we find:\nU(t)|f \u00f1 = e-iHt |f \u00f1 = (2p )- \u00e5 eimf -imw t |m\u00f1 = |f -w t\u00f1\nwhich is precisely the behavior one expects of the hand of a clock: it rotates at constant angular velocity and after an arbitrarily short time an eigenstate |f \u00f1 of the hand position goes over into an orthogonal state. Putting w = 1 we see that f plays the role of a time-variable: under a time translation it behaves exactly as t does. The energy of this continuous clock is unbounded from below but the energy values are discrete. Returning once more to Pauli's argument we see that discrete energy eigenvalues do not rule out the existence of a decent time-operator, even though its spectrum is not the real axis.\nLet us now see what happens if we restrict the energy of our clock.\nThe discrete cyclic quantum clock\nLet us restrict the sum in (12) to values of m satisfying the condition -l \u00a3 m \u00a3 l, where l is a positive integer, and consider the 2l+ 1 orthogonal states\n(13) |f k\u00f1 = (2l+1)-\n|m\u00f1 ,\nwhere f k takes the values\nf k = 2p k/(2l+1), k\u00a0= -l,,l.\nWe may now define a time-operator\nQ \u00ba\nf k |f k\u00f1 \u00e1 f k|.\nThe eigenvalues of Q are the (2l+1) discrete times f k and if the system is in the eigenstate |f k\u00f1 at time t, it will be in the eigenstate |f k+1\u00f1 at time t+2p /(2l+1), as may easily be verified by applying the evolution operator U(t) to |f k\u00f1 . This brings to mind the famous clock in the railway station which can only show discrete times! Note that by allowing l to increase we may approximate a continuous clock as closely as we wish.\nThe uncertainty principle\nTime-operators, being ordinary operators, satisfy uncertainty relations with their canonical conjugates. Thus, for our linear clock it follows from [q ,h ]\u00a0= ih that q and h satisfy the usual Heisenberg uncertainty relation D q D h \u00b3 h . The case of the continuous cyclic clock is mathematically more complicated (just as is the case of angle and angular momentum) and we will not discuss it here. A very nice illustration of the uncertainty principle is provided by the discrete cyclic quantum clock. From (13) we see that in an eigenstate |f k\u00f1 of the time-operator all eigenstates of L appear with equal probability and the converse is also true. This means that if the value of f k is maximally certain, the value of L is maximally uncertain, and conversely.\nNote that in all these examples the conjugate operator of the time-operator coincides with the Hamiltonian. However, this need not be generally so; it is merely due to the simplicity of our examples (compare the case of a single particle where the conjugate momentum p coincides with the total momentum P).\nV. A REMARK ON POSITION IN RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM MECHANICS\nBecause of the dominant role particles and rigid bodies play in classical physics the notion\nof the position of a physical system seemed unproblematic. This is still true in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, although we have seen that position-operators may have discrete eigenvalues (and may not even exist for special systems). However, in relativistic quantum mechanics the concept of a position-operator encounters serious problems. As could have been surmised from our remarks in section II, a point particle can mimic the behavior of a point in space but it cannot mimic the behavior of a point in spacetime. In a famous paper, T.D. Newton and E.P. Wigner showed that the required behavior of a position operator under space translations and rotations almost uniquely determines this operator. However, the resulting operator q is non-covariant and, due to its energy being positive, has the ugly property that a state which is an eigenstate of it at a given time (a so-called 'localized' state) will be spread out over all of space an infinitesimal time later. This result has given rise to an extensive literature on the feasibility of a localizable particle concept in relativistic quantum theory. In the case of a Dirac spin- particle the Newton-Wigner position operator turns out to be identical with the Foldy-Wouthuysen \"mean position\" operator. From our point of view, this case is particularly interesting for when the Dirac-equation was conceived in 1928 the space-part x of the four-vector appearing as the argument of Dirac's four-spinor 'wavefunction' y (x,ct), was identified with the position of the electron. This had the embarrassing consequence that the corresponding 'velocity' of the electron would always be found to be the velocity of light. It took twenty years before this problem was solved and the proper position-operator q was identified. Here again, the notation x for both the particle position and the space-coordinate certainly has obscured the issue.\nIn relativistic quantum field theory neither the position of a particle nor the concept of a clock-variable play a role. There, the basic quantity is the operator field f (x,t) which is parametrized by the c-number coordinates of spacetime points.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nWhen looking for a time-operator in quantum mechanics, a distinction must be made between the universal time coordinate t, a c-number like the space-coordinates, and dynamical time-variables of physical systems situated in space-time. Time-variables stand in a particularly simple relation to t and do exist in specific physical systems: clocks. In the quantum formalism position- and time-variables are not treated differently. Much of the confusion about time in quantum mechanics has been caused by not making a proper distinction, in classical as well as in quantum physics, between position-variables of particles and coordinates of points of space. Dynamical position- and time-variables of material systems are essentially non-covariant quantities. The demands of relativistic covariance are so stringent in quantum mechanics that no concept of a point particle can meet them, rendering the whole discussion about dynamical time- and position-variables somewhat obsolete. The quantum field seems to be the more fruitful concept to incorporate relativistic covariance in quantum physics.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n"}, {"score": 2649.8164, "uuid": "fafd4f25-ffd7-576f-9eac-f354d9e451a6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1612wb-47-15816", "target_hostname": "dipless.hubpages.com", "target_uri": "http://dipless.hubpages.com/hub/Quantum-Physics---Sub-Atomic-particles", "page_rank": 1.4031605e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "<em>Quantum</em> <em>Physics</em> - Subatomic particles", "snippet": "Have you taken a look at my other <em>physics</em> hubs? &#x27;<em>And</em> then a miracle occurs&#x27; - One of my favorite comic - it&#x27;s used for economic, religious, political - <em>and</em> my checking account balance! <em>The</em> relationship <em>between</em> <em>the</em> observer <em>and</em> <em>the</em> observed <em>is</em> <em>the</em> crux of <em>the</em> <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Just how Quantum Physics feels sometimes\nQuarks\nDue to a phenomenon known as color confinement which involves the strong force and was developed in the theory of Quantum chromodynamics (QCD), in order to prevent Pauli exclusion principle being violated (This is very vague and a hub on this will be coming soon). Quarks are never in isolation; they can only be found within hadrons (i.e protons, neutrons etc). For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of the hadrons themselves.\nThere are six different types of quarks, known as flavors: up (u), down (d), charm (c), strange (s), top (t) and bottom (b).\nUp and down quarks have the lowest masses of all quarks and are the most stable and most common in the universe. The other quarks are much bigger, and rapidly decay into the lighter up and down quarks. Due to this, the heavier charm, strange, top and bottom quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions, such as in particle accelerators such as the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) in CERN. They are also produced in collisions involving cosmic rays.\nQuarks have fractional electric charge values, either \u00e2\u0088\u00921\u00e2\u0081\u00843 or +2\u00e2\u0081\u00843 times the elementary charge which is the charge of an electron (e-), depending on flavor: up, charm and top quarks have a charge of +2\u00e2\u0081\u00843, while down, strange and bottom quarks have \u00e2\u0088\u00921\u00e2\u0081\u00843. The common particles (hadrons)\u00c2\u00a0of the neucleus of atoms i.e. the neutron and the protons are made up of three differnet quarks in different combinations. For example the proton is made up of 2 up quarks and a down quark, this can be worked out using the chart above to calculate the charges (2/3 x 2) + -1/3 = +1 the charge of the proton. So what do you think the neutron is made of? (it has a charge of 0)\nSpin is an intrinsic property of quantum particles, and its direction is an important 'degree of freedom'. It is sometimes visualized as the rotation of an object around its own axis (hence the name spin), but this notion is somewhat misguided at subatomic scales because elementary particles are believed to be point-like so have no axis. Spin can be represented by a vector whose length is measured in units of h/(2\u00cf\u0080), where h is the Planck constant. The spin of a quark along any axis is always either \u00c4\u00a7/2 or \u00e2\u0088\u0092\u00c4\u00a7/2; so quarks are classified as 1/2 spin particles.This spin is known as spin-up or spin-down and is used throughout many of the experiments later in the series.\nLeptons and Quarks\nLeptons\nLeptons\nThe first lepton identified was the electron, discovered in 1897. Then in 1930, Wolfgang Pauli predicted the electron neutrino to preserve conservation of energy, conservation of momentum, and conservation of angular momentum in beta decay. Pauli hypothisized that this undetected particle was carrying away the observed difference between the energy, momentum, and angular momentum of the particles. The electron neutrino was simply known as the neutrino back then, as it was not yet known that neutrinos came in different flavours.\nthe muon was discovered in 1936, 40 years after the electron. It was initially categorized as a meson rather than a lepton due to it's massive mass, however it was realized the muon was much more similar to the electron than other mesons, as muons do not experience the strong interaction and hence was re-catorigized. In 1962 it was proved that more than one type of neutrino exists by first detecting interactions of the muon neutrino, which earned Leon M. Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger the 1988 Nobel Prize.\nThe tau was first detected in a series of experiments between 1974 and 1977. Like the electron and the muon, it too was expected to have an associated neutrino. The first evidence for tau neutrinos came from the observation of missing energy and momentum in tau decay, similar to the missing energy and momentum in beta decay leading to the discovery of the electron neutrino. The first detection of tau neutrino interactions was announced in 2000 making it the latest particle of the Standard Model to have been directly observed.\nLeptons are 1/2 spin particles similar to Quarks, so see that section above for more information.\none of the most important properties of the leptons is their charges designated by Q. This charge determines how strong the electromagnetic interactions, the how strongly a particle reacts to a magnetic field and the strength of the magnetic and electrical fields created by these particles. Each group of Lepton's have a particle with a charge of -1 e.g. electron, muon and Tau and one with a charge of 0 the respective neutrino's.\n\u00c2\nPlease take a look at further articles in the series or if you are really interested take a look at some of the great books listed.\n"}, {"score": 2646.1187, "uuid": "caf06200-4668-583a-88a2-9486b208325e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0309wb-59-01579", "target_hostname": "madsci.org", "target_uri": "http://madsci.org/posts/archives/1997-03/853897137.Ph.r.html", "page_rank": 1.1909108e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Re: <em>What</em> <em>is</em> &#x27;<em>Quantum</em> Theory?&#x27;", "snippet": "We call this Wave-Particle duality <em>and</em> it <em>is</em> <em>what</em> led to <em>Quantum</em> Theory being discovered.

It was found that there was no difference between `solid' particles and the waves that make up light. So an Electron can be treated as if it was a wave and light can be treated as if it is a particle, in this case we call light a Photon. We call this Wave-Particle duality and it is what led to Quantum Theory being discovered. I will warn you that Quantum Theory is not easy to understand or appreciate.\nThe word Quantum means `in discrete amounts. What was found is that the energy of an electron, say, can only have whole values 1,2,3,4, or 5, and so on, of a smallest value. You can not have one and half amounts of this value. We would say that the energy is `qauntised'. This is like saying that you can only buy whole bars of Chocolate or Cereals. You can not buy half a bar or half a box. In the same way you can not have half an electron or half a photon. More importantly Quantum Theory says that you can only have sizes of bars of chocolate that are multiples of a fixed amount. I.E. 5 grams, 10 grams, 15 grams, 20 grams, 25 grams and so on. You can not have a bar of chocolate that is 23 grams in weight. Nor can you have a bar that is 4 grams in weight as 5 grams is the smallest allowed value.\nFor a look at the history behind you this I am including a few links I found on the Web.

The examples, however, are not just superficial, but truly do cut to the heart of both quantum physics and theology, providing deep insights into both realms of inquiry.\nAnother shortcoming is that Polkinghorne never really resolves the fundamental difference between science and religion - that science can be replicated, while religion cannot. But, again, this isn't Polkinghorne's point ... but after doing such a good job with the similarities between the two subjects, it would certainly have been nice to have seen him address the fundamental differences as well.\nIt's not that Polkinghorne isn't aware of the differences, but just that it wasn't the point. This book is short, crisp, and on message: theologians, in their own way, use a scientific-like methodology.\nUser Reviews\n"}], [{"score": 2640.633, "uuid": "c6a0034a-68fd-51f6-802a-830a249968e4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1006wb-12-04166", "target_hostname": "h2g2.com", "target_uri": "http://h2g2.com/dna/h2g2/A781823", "page_rank": 1.1882351e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "h2g2 - <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>", "snippet": "This <em>is</em> due to <em>the</em> fact that <em>the</em> properties <em>and</em> behaviour of electrons <em>and</em> nuclei (<em>the</em> building blocks of atoms <em>and</em> molecules) are completely foreign to our everyday experience. <em>The</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> <em>quantum</em> <em>and</em> classical <em>mechanics</em> can be summed up very succinctly.", "explanation": null, "document": "Contact Us\nQuantum Mechanics is the branch of science that deals with extremely small particles. These particles are so incredibly small that they lie completely outside the realm of human experience. Fundamentally, this is why the ideas of quantum mechanics seem so bizarre to us. One of the most beautiful aspects of quantum mechanics is that when the equations are applied to 'normal' sized objects (ie, a bowling ball), you get the same results as you would with Newton's Laws of Motion 1 .\nProblems in quantum mechanics seem to be much more difficult than those in classical (Newtonian) mechanics; but, in general, the judging committee is somewhat biased. Everyone grows up learning classical mechanics from everyday experiences, and this gives us a powerful intuition from which we can start to think about more abstract classical mechanics problems. It is much easier to describe how a building holds up during a hurricane or why helicopters can hover, because everyone has experienced gravity and is familiar with concepts like strength, hardness, wind, etc. It is much more difficult to explain the quantum analogue - for example, why atoms emit radiation, or how molecules form from atoms. This is due to the fact that the properties and behaviour of electrons and nuclei (the building blocks of atoms and molecules) are completely foreign to our everyday experience.\nThe difference between quantum and classical mechanics can be summed up very succinctly. Newton assumed that the position and velocity of any object could be defined with arbitrary precision. This assumption works extremely well for macroscopic objects - like the previously referenced bowling ball. However, there is no basis for this assumption outside of our empirical everyday experiences! Quantum mechanics is simply a formulation of mechanics in which the assumption of arbitrary precision has been thrown out. The consequences, however startling, all derive from this new statement of finite precision. The finite precision is not a result of our inability to make precise measurements; it is a fundamental fact about the nature of particles. The exact extent to which precision is limited is quantified by Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle .\nTunnelling - an Example\nThere is a quantum phenomenon known as tunnelling, which states that it is possible for a particle to end up on the opposite side of a barrier even if it doesn't have enough energy to pass over the barrier. The classical mechanics analogue would involve riding a roller coaster, in which the operator didn't give it enough speed to reach the top of the track. In the classical mechanics world, the coaster would stop near the top (at a point known as the 'classical turning point'), and roll backwards. In the quantum world there is a chance that the 'roller coaster' 2 , would appear on the other side of the crest, at which point it would begin to roll forward as if nothing unusual had just happened.\nThis is a quintessential example of a bizarre quantum phenomenon that has no classical analogue. However, it is easily understood in the context of finite precision of the velocity of the roller coaster. If, for some reason, we were unsure of the velocity that the operator initially gave the coaster, maybe by about plus or minus 10 km/hr, then we would be unable to say whether the coaster was going reach the top and continue, or merely stop and roll backwards. We could make a guess, based on the most probable velocity of the coaster, as to whether or not the coaster would reach the top or fall back, but we couldn't say for certain one way or the other. This is exactly the cause of tunneling in the quantum world: the uncertainty in the velocity (or energy) of a particle makes it possible for an event that should be impossible to occur. Another critical feature of the tunneling problem is the fact that after the tunneling event has occurred, the uncertainty in the coaster's velocity would remain. Intuitively we think that we should know some information about the coaster's velocity if it made it up the other side of the peak, but that is not the case quantum mechanically because the uncertainty in the velocity is fundamental to the nature of all particles!\nThe Maths of Probability\nThe rest of quantum mechanics is just the maths necessary to describe events in terms of probabilities , instead of certainties. There is, however, a direct mathematical connection to classical mechanics, given by Ehrenfest's Theorem. According to this theorem, the maximum limit of the probability distribution for a particle obeys Newton's Laws of Motion. Ehrenfest's theorem is the exact mathematical statement of why quantum mechanics works exactly the same as classical mechanics when applied to large objects. This is a huge boon to people who use quantum mechanics, as it allows them to step back and use their intuition from the classical mechanics world. However, most of the interesting quantum mechanics comes from the shape of the probability distribution, not just the peak, so it is critically important to use the exact quantum formalism when dealing with microscopic particles. It is amazing how much more difficult it is to work with probabilities, but it doesn't appear as if there is any viable alternative. Although many other theories have been proposed to replace quantum mechanics, all have either failed when confronted by experiment, or have proven to be even more cumbersome mathematically.\nAdvanced Concepts in Quantum Mechanics\nThe goal of this section is to very briefly go over some of the maths involved in quantum mechanics. It will not cover the points described above, but is mainly designed to give anyone who remembers their classical mechanics a feel for why quantum mechanical calculations can be so much harder than their classical mechanical equivalents.\nThe big scientific theories are usually composed of laws or postulates. Quantum mechanics is no different. In order to explain these postulates, let's imagine an electron whose motion is confined to some arbitary space. The most common example of this would be the electrons that are in plain, everyday atoms. This confined electron will be our \"system\". The classical mechanics equivalent of this system would be a marble in a large mixing bowl. The marble can roll around in the bowl with all kinds of interesting motion, and will even fly out of the bowl if it gets rolling fast enough. These systems will be critical in explaining the main posulates of quantum mechanics 3 :\nThe fundamental idea behind all quantum mechanics is the concept of using eigenstates to describe systems. There are three main points to make about eigenstates:\nThe energy, velocity, position, etc. of the system is defined by its eigenstates. The energy (and other observables) of each eigenstate usually can only take on discrete, non-continuous values. In the case of our electron, there could be two eigenstates, one with an energy of 1 eV 4 , and another with an energy of 2.5 eV. There would be no eigenstates associated with any other values of the energy. The energy of the electron is then said to be quantized 5 .\nEach eigenstate has associated with it a stationary state wavefunction, \u03c8. There would be one wavefunction for each of the values of the energy listed above (\u03c81 and \u03c82). The square of the wavefunction |\u03c8|2 gives the probability distribution of the eigenstate. The vertical lines denote a special form of squaring:\n|\u03c8| 2 = (\u03c8 *) \u03c8\nwhere \u03c8* is the complex-conjugate of \u03c8 6 . For example, if the vector r denotes the position of the marble within the bowl, or the electron within the atom, then the wavefunction for the marble would be \u03c8(r). The probability of finding the marble (or electron) at a given location would be given by |\u03c8(r)|2. The integral of this function over all space must be 1. This condition is known as normalisation and it is a simple mathematical requirement of any probability distribution - it is the result of the definition of probability.\nThe current state of the system is defined by any linear combination of the eigenstates. This new wavefunction is known as a superposition state. Using our eigenstate wavefunctions from above, a superposition of the system could be defined as:\n\u03a8 = 0.707*\u03c8 1 + 0.707*\u03c8 2\nThe probability function for this superposition state is given by:\n|\u03a8| 2 = |0.707*\u03c8 1 + 0.707*\u03c8 2| 2\nSince this is still a probability distribution, the laws of probability still hold, and it too must be normalized. The odd-looking decimal coefficients are a result of the normalization condition. This state actually corresponds to an equal mixture of the two eigenstates.\nPhysical quantities, such as energy, velocity, position, etc. are determined from wavefunctions by the use of operators 7 . Operators are the equivalent of mathematical commands - for example \"take the derivate with respect to x\" is an operator. The most important operator in quantum mechanics is the energy operator, also known as the Hamiltonian (denoted H). As the name implies, this operator is used to calculate the energy of the system. The actual calculation of a physical quantity involves sandwiching the operator into the probability distribution of the system, and then integrating over all space. This gives the expected value of the physical quantity, or \"expectation\" value. The expectation value of the energy would be denoted as <E> and it would be calculated using:\n<E> = \u222b\u03c8 *H\u03c8 dr\nWhen carrying out an actual experiment, individual measurements will only yield physically observable quantities corresponding to the discrete eigenvalues of one of the possible eigenstates of the system. In the case of our electron in a superposition state, a single measurement of the energy will only yield either a value of 1 or 2.5 eV. This is where the idea of quantization of the electron's energy is actually observed. Usually what happens is that a large number of measurements are made repeatedly on the system, or one measurement is made on a large number of identical systems. In this scenario, the quantization is washed out, and the average energy (1.75 eV in the case of the superposition state above) is observed.\nThe probability of observing one of the allowed energies from the superposition state is given by the square of the coefficient of the corresponding eigenstate. In our example, the coefficient of each state is 0.707, and since (0.707)2 = 0.5, the probability of measuring each energy is \u00bd. In this case measuring the values of the energy is the same as flipping a coin - heads means 1 eV, tails means 2.5 eV.\nAfter carrying out a measurement on a superposition state, the system will no longer be in the superposition state. Instead it will be in the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue that was just measured. In our example, if we measure our system to have an energy of 1 eV, then the system after the measurement is only in the eigenstate which has the wavefunction *\u03c81. Repeated measurements of the exact same system will forever after only yield the energy of 1 eV.\nThe superposition state (and thus the system) evolves in time according to the Schrodinger equation:\ni*(h/2\u03c0)*(\u2202/\u2202t)\u03a8 = H\u03a8\nwhere i is the imaginary number 8 , h is Planck's constant, \u03c0 is the irrational number pi , \u2202/\u2202t is the derivative with respect to time, \u03a8 is the superposition state, and H is the Hamiltonian (energy) operator. Usually this equation must be solved numerically by very large computers for all but the most simple cases.\nThese are the rules which physicists apply to tiny particles to achieve the dazzling and mind-boggling effects of quantum mechanics. Most of them have fairly simple mathematical representations; but, unfortunately, the mathematical quantities being described lie far outside of our everyday experiences.\n1 The quantum calculation would definitely be the hard way of doing things, and is generally not recommended, except for masochists and physics graduate students. If you have your choice, always choose Newton.\n2 An example of an actual quantum system would be an electron moving against an electric field. This is the basis for a technique known as Scanning Tip Microscopy (STM) .\n3 The list of postulates is from Quantum Mechanics by Cohen-Tannoudji, Diu, and Laloe, Chapter 3, pp. 215-22\n4 eV stands for electron-volt, and is a unit of energy typically employed when describing electrons in atoms. It is equal to 1.6 x 10-19 Joules (SI units) or 3.7 x 10-20 calories (English Units).\n5 Which means to limit the possible values of (a magnitude or quantity) to a discrete set of values by quantum mechanical rules.\n6 The complex conjugate is used when dealing with imaginary numbers . It simply means that if the number has an imaginary part, multiply this imaginary part by the quantity -1.\n7 A good mathematical description of an operator is that it is a function whose domain and range are both functions - a mapping from some function-space to some other function-space. This is in contrast to regular transformations (ie, regular functions like z = y + x2), which take some kind of vector space and map into another vector space.\n8 Defined as the square root of -1.\nThis article has not been bookmarked.\nENTRY DATA\n"}, {"score": 2634.7876, "uuid": "db383105-0e60-5dbe-a119-0edbaa85ad4c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0207wb-55-28024", "target_hostname": "www.i-sis.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.i-sis.org.uk/QPAQC.php", "page_rank": 1.1939003e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "<em>Quantum</em> Phases <em>and</em> <em>Quantum</em> Coherence", "snippet": "Both <em>the</em> AB effects <em>and</em> <em>the</em> Berry phases have been incorporated into many fields of <em>physics</em> including optics, nuclear <em>physics</em>, fluid <em>physics</em>, chemistry, molecular <em>physics</em>, string theory, gravitational <em>physics</em>, cosmology, solid-state <em>physics</em>, <em>the</em> foundations of <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em> <em>and</em> <em>quantum</em> computing.", "explanation": null, "document": "ISIS members area log in\nViews and goods advertized are not necessarily endorsed by Science in Society or the Inst. of Science in Society.\nISIS Report 17/03/04\nQuantum Phases and Quantum Coherence\nDr. Mae-Wan Ho investigates the link between quantum phases and quantum coherence, and comes up with the surprising implication that the universe itself may be quantum coherent\nA fully illustrated version of this article with sources is posted on ISIS Members\u0092 website. here .\nQuantum phases\nIn classical electromagnetic theory, the vector and scalar potentials in Maxwell\u0092s equations of the electromagnetic field are purely mathematical entities without physical significance, but not so in quantum mechanics.\nIn 1959, quantum physicists Yakir Aharonov and the late David Bohm at Birbeck College, London University, proposed a thought-experiment in which an electron beam is directed towards a long thin magnetic field trapped inside a tightly-wound coil of electric wire, a solenoid. The beam is split into two so that one passes to the left and the other to the right of the solenoid. Although the magnetic field is zero outside the solenoid, the vector potential associated with the field is not zero. Aharonov and Bohm predicted that, according to quantum theory \u0096 described by Schr\u00f6dinger\u0092s wave function - the two beams, being wave-like, would acquire different phases due to their interaction with the vector potential, even though the field itself was zero, and that the difference between these phases could be detected via interference.\nThe effect was soon observed in experiments. One of the more remarkable experiments to demonstrate the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect was carried out by Akira Tonomura of Hitachi Laboratory in Japan, using microscopic toroidal (doughnut shaped) magnets. In such a magnet, the magnetic field is trapped inside, and no magnetic field exists either in the hole in through the middle or in the space outside the torus. So, electron beams split into components that pass through the middle and the outside would be expected to have a different phase.\nIn the 1970s, Tonomura succeeded in making a highly coherent electron microscope \u0096 with coherence more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of a conventional electron microscope. This was the basis of a technique known as electron holography, an interference electron microscopy that could be used to show up the contour map of the electron phase. This enabled him to pick out perfect magnets that do not leak magnetic fields to the outside.\nIn 1982, using a holography electron microscope Tonomura and his colleagues measured the phase difference in the form of interference fringes produced by two beams of electrons, one passing through the inside and the other passing through the outside of a doughnut-shaped magnet. They clearly showed that there is a phase difference between the two electrons beams passing through regions of space that have no magnetic field, and that the extent of the phase difference precisely matches the predicted value.\nSoon after publishing the results, an objection was raised to this experiment. As the electron beams contacted the magnet, i.e. there were leakage magnetic fields in space, that could have created the phase differential. If so, the experiment did not prove the existence of the AB effect.\nTo settle this dispute, Tonomura and his colleagues made a doughnut-shaped ferromagnet six micrometers in diameter (Fig. 1(a) and (b)), and covered it with a niobium superconductor to completely confine the magnetic field within the doughnut. With the magnet maintained at a temperature of 5 K, they measured the phase difference from the interference fringes between one electron beam passing though the hole in the doughnut and the other passing on the outside of the doughnut. As can be seen in Fig. 1(a), interference fringes are displaced with just half-fringe spacing inside and outside of the doughnut, proving the existence of the AB effect. In other words, electrons passing through regions free of any electromagnetic field, nevertheless interacted with the vector potentials in the regions. Tonomura received numerous prizes for this work.\nFigure 1. Aharonov-Bohm effect caught in the act.\nIndependently in 1984, Michael Berry at Warwick University, Coventry, UK, showed that quantum systems could acquire what is known as a \u0091geometric phase\u0092 under certain conditions. He was studying quantum systems in which the Hamiltonian (energy equation) describing the system is slowly changed so that it eventually returns to its initial form. Berry showed that the \u0091adiabatic theorem\u0092, widely used to describe such systems, was incomplete. In particular he found that the system acquired a \u0091phase factor\u0092 that depended on the path followed, but not on the rate at which the Hamiltonian was changed. This geometric phase factor, now known as the \u0091Berry phase\u0092, was later shown to be a generalization of the AB effect. They arise essentially because of the inherently wave-like character of all quantum systems.\nBoth the AB effects and the Berry phases have been incorporated into many fields of physics including optics, nuclear physics, fluid physics, chemistry, molecular physics, string theory, gravitational physics, cosmology, solid-state physics, the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum computing. Aharonov and Berry eventually shared the 1998 Wolf Prize for their work.\nWhy should quantum phases turn up everywhere, from the microscopic to the macroscopic and even to the cosmological scale? Quantum phases depend ultimately on the coherence of quantum systems; and the fact that they turn up over all scales implies that nature is quantum, and not classical.\nQuantum coherence\nIndeed, quantum coherence (see Box) has come up in cosmology and quantum computation. According to a quantum cosmological model in which the universe comes into being via a period of \u0091cosmic inflation\u0092, the universe will naturally end up in a coherent superposition of classical states; and in quantum computation, people are asking whether anything interesting or useful will result by allowing computers to evolve as coherent superposition of computational states.\nWhat is quantum coherence?\n\u0091Coherence\u0092 is generally understood as \u0091wholeness\u0092, a correlation over space and time. Atoms vibrating in phase, teams rowing in synchrony in a boat race, choirs singing harmony, troops dancing in exquisite formations, all conform to our ordinary notion of coherence.\nQuantum coherence implies all that and more. Think of a gathering of consummate musicians playing jazz together (\u0091quantum jazz\u0092) where every single player is freely improvising from moment to moment and yet keeping in tune and in rhythm with the spontaneity of the whole. It is a special kind of wholeness that maximizes both local freedom and global cohesion.\nFor a succinct technical definition, I like the one offered by cosmologist Andreas Albrecht at University of California at Davis, United States.\n\"Quantum mechanics is different from classical mechanics in several ways. Firstly, the state of a system is defined most fundamentally by probability amplitudes (the \"wavefunction\") which must be squared to get the probabilities. Secondly, the space of possible quantum states is quite different from its classical counterpart. Positions and momenta cannot be both specified precisely..\n\"To the extent that the probabilities are all one needs, I will say one is working with a \"classical\" probability distribution, regardless of whether the actual space of possible states has quantum mechanical features or not. To the extent that one needs to know the initial probability amplitudes (rather than just the probabilities) in order to do the right calculation, I will say that the system exhibits \"quantum coherence\".\nAlbrecht (see Box) is implying that all quantum systems exhibit quantum coherence. And the complex phase of the wave function matters in quantum coherent systems.\nBut why is it, if nature is fundamentally quantum mechanical, that we see it predominantly as classical in our everyday life?\nThat is because a quantum system enters into quantum entanglement with the observer. So, how one chooses to observe the system determines what is being observed. There is a \"very subjective\" element, said Albrecht. We must choose to use an observational basis that reveals the quantum mechanical properties, that preserves quantum coherence, in order to observe them.\nBut there are practical limitations on the types of measurements that are possible in practice, and most measurements will tend to destroy the quantum coherence of the system in any case.\nThe reason it took so long to discover quantum coherence is because there is very good agreement (among observers and environments) as to what basis one uses both to measure and describe the world \u0096 namely a basis which closely approximates wave packets fairly localized both in position and momentum, and is hence classical.\nAs heavy macroscopic things tend to have localized position and momentum, \"the only quantum coherence effects have a natural interpretation in terms of a classical momentum, as long as one sticks to this \"classical\" basis\". Furthermore, as the environment gets correlated with these macroscopic things in the same basis, the effects of decoherence are unimportant. For these reasons, the effects of quantum coherence are definitely not part of everyday experience, and, according to Albrecht, \"it takes clever experimentalists to set up a situation to observe such effects\"\nOne way to observe quantum effects, as we have seen (\" Nature is quantum, really \", this series), is by \"weak measurement\", using very sensitive equipment.\nDoes this not also say something to us about non-invasive, non-destructive and non-violent ways of studying living systems and relating to the world in general?\nI-SIS is a not-for-profit organisation, depending on donations , membership fees, subscriptions , and merchandise sales to continue its work.

In so doing we will encounter new aspects of nature; new in the sense that they have not been systematically discussed in your study of physics heretofore. These aspects of nature are commonly referred to as quantum phenomena, and we, therefore, call the subject matter of this section quantum physics. The currently accepted basic mathematical theory of quantum physics is known as quantum mechanics, although we will not proceed very far along the road toward a full understanding of quantum mechanics, but will try to lay a good basic, experimental and historical foundation for that full understanding, which you may eventually decide you want, or need, to develop. As an additional introductory comment, we should also be sure that you understand that \"quantum physics\" is indeed something which does concern the everyday, macroscopic world. Actually all of the physical description of the actual world is quantum physics; the laws of quantum physics, as we know them today, are our most general set of laws of nature. Therefore, we will also endeavor to explain how it is that the particular sizes of objects and devices in our everyday world make their quantum nature much less obvious.\nThe laws of nature which you have previously discussed in your introductory sequence of physics courses are the laws of classical physics. Generally we can say that classical physics is concerned with those aspects of nature for which the question of the ultimate constitution of matter is not of immediate concern. On the other hand, in our new study, we will specifically ask questions concerning the elementary constituents of matter. We now know that matter is made of a relatively small set of elementary particles; we must therefore also now try to discover the laws which govern the behavior of these particles. We will naturally focus our attention on physical situations in which these laws stand out as clearly as possible; this means that we will study situations involving the interactions of only a few particles at a time. Most of the physics studied in the rest of this course could, therefore, be called \"microphysics\"; the study of \"small\" systems consisting of a relatively small number of elementary particles.\nHowever, if we know the basic laws governing the elementary particles we can also, in principle, predict the behavior of macroscopic physical systems, consisting of a very large number of elementary particles. This means that the laws of classical physics follow from the laws of microphysics, and in this sense quantum mechanics is just as relevant in the macroscopic world as in the microscopic world.\nWhen we apply the laws of classical physics to macroscopic systems, we only try to describe certain gross features of the behavior of the system. We may consider, for instance, the motion of a \"rigid body\" as a whole, but we do not try to discuss the motions of each and every elementary constituent of the body. This approach is a general characteristic feature of classical theories of physics as applied to macroscopic systems; the finer details of the behavior of the system are ignored, and we make no attempt to consider all aspects of the situation. In this sense the laws of classical physics are approximate laws of nature. We should regard them as limiting forms of the more basic and comprehensive laws of physics, which are indeed the laws of quantum physics.\nThe classical theories are, in other words, phenomenological theories. A phenomenological theory attempts to describe and summarize experimental facts within some limited domain of phenomena. It is not intended to completely describe everything in physics, but if it is a good phenomenological theory it does describe everything within the limited domain very accurately. The philosophically-minded reader may want to remark that ultimately every physical theory is \"phenomenological,\" and that the difference between a basic theory and a phenomenological theory is only a question of degree. As physicists we recognize, however, a clear difference between the two kinds of theories. Our basic laws of nature are distinguished by their great generality; we are not aware of any exceptions to what they state. We regard them as true and exact and universally valid, until there is clear experimental evidence that they are false. In contrast to this, the laws contained in a phenomenological theory are recognized not to be of universal validity; we know that they are valid, i.e., sufficiently accurate, only in some limited domain of physics, and outside this domain the phenomenological theory may even be completely meaningless.\nWe should, of course, have no contempt for phenomenological theories. They serve the very useful purpose of summarizing our practical knowledge of the various domains of physics. There ar many instances in physics in which we do believe that we have available a basic theory, but where the complexity of the phenomena prevents us from making accurate predictions based on \"first principles.\" In such a case we try a simplified phenomenological theory which is partly based directly on the experimental facts, and partly based on some general features of the basic theory. We let, in other words, \"the physical systems do some of our theoretical work.\" There are, furthermore, many instances in physics where the basic theory is missing. Any phenomenological theory which we can construct (based on some simple model) is then useful as a stepping stone in the search for a more comprehensive theory.\nWhen we try to understand an unfamiliar physical phenomenon it is clearly rational to try the simplest thing first, i.e., to try a theory, or model, which has worked successfully in a seemingly analogous situation. If our model turns out to be successful we have learned something; but, if it turns out to be unsuccessful we have also learned something. It is an important aspect of the study of physics to learn to use phenomenological models successfully, and to learn to understand their limitations. The important thing to keep in mind is that models are only models, and that all of physics need ot be describe in terms of a single model.\nPeople often talk about the \"revolution\" in physics brought about through the discovery of quantum mechanics. This suggests that something has been completely overturned. However, it should be noted, that the laws of classical physics, as applied to those situations which the classical theory was designed to describe, have not been overturned. The motion of a pendulum, for example, is described today in the same way as it was described in the nineteenth century.\nIt is furthermore the case that classical concepts often can be successfully employed to gain some understanding of phenomena in micro-physics: those concepts are of approximate validity. It is therefore important that we understand the limits of applicability of classical ideas. That the classical theories of physics are not of universal validity has been convincingly established through many experiments performed during the twentieth century. During the remainder of this course we shall present some of the relevant experimental evidence to convince the reader of this fact of life.\nIt is important to realize that whereas the laws of classical physics are good phenomenological laws, they do not tell us everything about macroscopic bodies. We can describe the behavior (motion) of a mechanism consisting of springs, levers, flywheels, etc., if we are given some \"material constants,\" such as the density, the modulus of elasticity, the spring constant, etc. of the materials of which the mechanism is built. However, if we ask why the densities are what they are, why the elastic constants have the values they have, why a rod will break if the tension in the rod exceeds a certain limit, and so on, then classical physics is silent. Classical physics does not tell us why copper melts, why sodium vapor emits yellow light, why hydrogen has the chemical properties it has, why the sun shines, why the uranium nucleus disintegrates spontaneously, why silver conducts electricity, why sulfur is an insulator, nor why permanent magnets can be made of steel. We could go on and on listing everyday observational facts about which classical physics has nothing to tell us. This is an important fact to recognize: there never was any comprehensive classical theory of matter. The reader want to know, then, do we now have a comprehensive theory of matter? The answer is no; we do not have a detailed theory for everything taking place in our world. However, our knowledge about nature has expanded enormously during the last hundred years. We have discovered aspects of nature never dreamed of before, and we have succeeded in solving many old problems. It is, for instance, fair to say that we now understand the facts of chemistry and the properties of matter in bulk quite well: in those domains of physics we can now answer the questions which could not even be truly discussed within classical physics.\nII. \u00a0\u00a0 The Idea of Elementary Particles:\nLet us now talk about the idea of elementary particles. Some ancient Greek philosophers are credited with being the first to introduce the concept of atoms into the theory of matter. It should of course be stated immediately that the \"atoms\" of the ancients are most certainly not the same things as our current conception of atoms. However, the central issue can be stated very simply: Either matter is infinitely divisible, or else, it is not infinitely divisible. If matter is not infinitely divisible, then we must discover, on a sufficiently small scale, elementary constituents of matter, or \"atoms.\" We take a chunk of matter, and we divide it again and again into smaller and smaller pieces. Eventually this splitting comes to an end; we find something which cannot be split further, and that is the \"atom.\" (The Greek word simply means \"not divisible.\")\nThe \"atoms\" of the Greek philosophers do not correspond to our use of the word atoms today, because our atoms are in fact not indivisible; they are instead made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. It is rather the protons, neutrons, electrons, and a whole host of other elementary particles which come closer to playing the role of the Greek \"atoms.\" [On the other hand, for the last, perhaps thirty years, it may well be that the \"quarks\" and \"gluons\" of modern-day particle physics come even closer to being those \"atoms.\" However, for now at least, we will ignore this possibility, and try to concentrate on these slightly more familiar elementary particles, namely the protons, neutrons, and electrons.] What do we actually mean by an \"elementary particle\"? The precise definition of this term is still controversial today; however, for our present purposes we may regard a particle as elementary if it cannot be (usefully) described as a composite system of still more elementary entities. This is more or less the same as saying that an elementary particle has no \"parts\"; i.e., it is not built of anything simpler. With this definition, we will consider the proton, the neutron and the electron as all being elementary, while the hydrogen atom or the uranium nucleus are not.\nHowever, we should now ask the question as to how we can assert that the electron is really elementary? Could it not happen that what is regarded as elementary today is found to be composite tomorrow? After all, the atoms of today were the elementary particles of the nineteenth century; could it not happen that history will repeat itself? There is considerable experimental evidence that suggests the contrary of this, i.e., that the electron will never be found to be composite in the same sense that the hydrogen atom is now thought to be composite. Let us try to describe some of the nature of this evidence.\nIf we now consider the collision of two marbles, with a sufficiently high relative velocity, they will break apart into smaller fragments. In the same way two hydrogen molecules colliding with a high relative velocity will break into fragments. Unless the velocity is very high we will find among the fragments such things as hydrogen atoms, or protons, or electrons; in other words we will find the components of which hydrogen molecules are built. In both these cases it is fair to describe what happened as follows: The violence of the collision overcame the cohesive forces which keep the parts together, in a marble, or in a hydrogen molecule, and the objects therefore broke apart. A similar interpretation can be given to many nuclear reactions. Nuclei are made of protons and neutrons, and if an energetic proton collides with a nucleus it may happen that a few protons and neutrons are knocked out of the nucleus. However, if we study a violent collision of two elementary particles, such as two protons, we discover phenomena which are qualitatively different from the phenomena considered above. For instance, if a proton of very high energy collides with another proton it may happen that the two protons remain after the collision but that in addition we find one, or several, new elementary particles such as pi-mesons, among the reaction products. We say that the pi-mesons are created in the reaction. This is not the only thing that may happen in a proton-proton collision. It may also happen that the protons disappear and instead a number of entirely new particles appear, known as K-mesons and hyperons.\nThe creation and destruction processes which we have mentioned are important aspects of nature. It should be obvious that these phenomena are in no way analogous to the shattering of marbles, and it is also obvious that we would find it difficult to understand what takes place on the basis of classical theories of physics.\nWe are not going to discuss the early history of the atomic theory of matter; but the reader is urged to meditate about the remarkable understanding of natural phenomena which was achieved during the nineteenth century on the basis of the hypothesis that matter is made of atoms. On this assumption we can understand the basic fact of chemistry, namely that a given chemical compound always consists of certain basic chemical elements in fixed, definite proportions, characteristic of that compound.\nExperience shows that we do not overcome our prejudices easily; we resist giving up our erroneous mental images. I want to state that it is not only beginning physics students who have prejudices about physics; the distinguished senior physicists have them as well. Let us consider, through a particular example, how prejudices influence our thinking. Many people have asked, and it may be that some people still do ask: \"Since the electron is a charged particle the different parts of the electron must repel each other. what are the forces that keep the electron together?\" Nobody has been able to \"explain what are the forces that hold the electron together.\" In view of this discouraging circumstance, many physicists have proposed that we should not think about the electron as being a small charged sphere; suppose, instead, that the electron is just a point, a mathematical point with no extent whatsoever. If we do that we get into a different sort of trouble; the Coulomb field around it now becomes infinite, so that the electrostatic energy is infinite.\nIII. \u00a0\u00a0Thoughts about some Experiments beginning Quantum Physics\nLet us now think calmly about all of this. In asking our questions we have clearly made many assumptions which reflect our prejudices. We have assumed (tacitly) that the electron is a small charged sphere and we have assumed that Coulomb's law can be applied to the parts of this sphere. How do we know that Coulomb's law applies to this situation? And what about the idea that a force has to hold together the \"parts\" of the electron against the electrostatic forces of repulsion? We have said earlier that the electron has no parts; it is an elementary particle. If we ask what holds the electron together it means that we contemplate the possibility that it could break into parts, but that is indeed a very questionable idea. Most physicists have realized by now that to try to create some kind of classical model for the electron is an utterly meaningless activity. The electron does not behave like a charged sphere, and all discussions about what would keep it together, if it would be like a charged sphere, are irrelevant in physics.\nNow let us think about the meaning of the word \"particle.\" A particle is an object which behaves in accordance with the ordinary laws of classical mechanics. A particle may be of finite size like a small billiard ball, or we may consider just the abstraction of a point particle. With a moving particle there is associated a trajectory; this trajectory is the curve traced ut by, say, the center of mass of the particle, as it moves in space. Furthermore a particle is something which \"stays together.\" It is some sense a single, localized, coherent object. In particular, if a stream of particles collide in some random fashion with a screen with two holes in it, then each one of the particles can do one of three things. Either the particle is reflected by the screen, or it goes through the first hole, or it goes through the second hole. These three events are mutually exclusive; the particle cannot go partly through the first hole and partly through the second hole.\nLater in this course we shall discuss experiments which have been performed with electrons, and which show that if an electron is incident on a screen with two holes in it, then the electron is partly reflected by the screen, and it goes partly through the first hole and partly through the second hole. \"Impossible\" exclaims the reader immediately. \"How could nature be so contradictory?\" This reaction is in fact correct; without preliminary definition of what a particle is, no particle can go simultaneously through two holes. It is, however, not impossible at all that an electron can go through two holes simultaneously; it if happens experimentally we must accept this fact. The conclusion to be drawn is that an electron is not a particle, in the classical sense of this word. We can then proceed to determine whether or not other objects in the world are particles, or behave like the electron, or perhaps are fashioned in yet some third way. Experimentally, we find that a proton, and in fact, all the objects in nature which we earlier thought were particles are actually not, but, rather, thins which can through two slits simultaneously, like the electron. However, if everything is really one of these new things, then we can go ahead and call them particles, just remembering that the other kind of particles are just something that was made up in the theory of classical physics. In fact, the world contains only one kind of particle, and they can indeed go through two slits at once.\nIt is an important aspect of our study of microphysics to learn to recognize the physical situations in which true particles can be described as if they were classical particles. We will also find, among other things, that true particles also have wave properties; in certain circumstances a true particle can behave like a wave. It would be a big mistake, however, to think that this is all there is to quantum physics; that particles are actually waves, as described by classical wave theory. As we shall see, this is not so; the classical waves are also figments of imagination, just like classical particles. Our prejudices about what a \"particle\" is are probably stronger than what a \"wave\" is, however; therefore, it may perhaps be easier to change your ideas about a wave than about a particle.\nThe important point to remember is that all the true particles in the world behave just as they do behave, and in certain situations their behavior approximates that of a classical, and in other situations their behavior approximates that of a classical particles. In yet other situations, they act like neither!\nadapted from The Berkeley Physics Course: Vol. 4, Quantum Physics, by E. H.

A brief paragraph in this essay described the cat\nparadox.\nOne can even set up quite ridiculous cases. A cat is penned up\nin a steel chamber, along with the following diabolical device\n(which must be secured against direct interference by the cat):\nin a Geiger counter there is a tiny bit of radioactive\nsubstance, so small that perhaps in the course of one hour one\nof the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability, perhaps\nnone; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a\nrelay releases a hammer which shatters a small flask of\nhydrocyanic acid. If one has left this entire system to itself\nfor an hour, one would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile\nno atom has decayed. The first atomic decay would have poisoned\nit. The Psi function for the entire system would express this by\nhaving in it the living and the dead cat (pardon the expression)\nmixed or smeared out in equal parts.\nIt is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy originally\nrestricted to the atomic domain becomes transformed into\nmacroscopic indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct\nobservation. That prevents us from so naively accepting as valid\na ``blurred model'' for representing reality. In itself it would\nnot embody anything unclear or contradictory. There is a\ndifference between a shaky or out-of-focus photograph and a\nsnapshot of clouds and fog banks.\nWe know that superposition of possible outcomes must exist\nsimultaneously at a microscopic level because we can observe\ninterference effects from these. We know (at least most of us know)\nthat the cat in the box is dead, alive or dying and not in a smeared\nout state between the alternatives. When and how does the model of\nmany microscopic possibilities resolve itself into a particular\nmacroscopic state? When and how does the fog bank of microscopic\npossibilities transform itself to the blurred picture we have of a\ndefinite macroscopic state. That is the measurement problem and\nSchrodinger's cat is a simple and elegant explanations of that\nproblem.\n1 E.

The Copenhagen interpretation\nThis is the oldest of the interpretations. It is based on Bohr's\nnotion of `complementarity'. Bohr felt that the classical and quantum\nmechanical models were two complementary ways of dealing with physics\nboth of which were necessary. Bohr felt that an experimental\nobservation collapsed or ruptured (his term) the wave function to make\nits future evolution consistent with what we observe experimentally.\nBohr understood that there was no precise way to define the exact\npoint at which collapse occurred. Any attempt to do so would yield a\ndifferent theory rather than an interpretation of the existing theory.\nNonetheless he felt it was connected to conscious observation as this\nwas the ultimate criterion by which we know a specific observation has\noccurred.\nN. Bohr, The quantum postulate and recent the recent development of\natomic theory, Nature, 121, 580-89 (1928), Reprinted in Quantum Theory\nand Measurement, p 87, (1983).\n5. Is QM a complete theory?\nPaul Budnik paul@mtnmath.com\nEinstein did not believe that God plays dice and thought a more\ncomplete theory would predict the actual outcome of experiments. He\nargued1 that quantities that are conserved absolutely (such as\nmomentum or energy) must correspond to some objective element of\nphysical reality. Because QM does not model this he felt it must be\nincomplete.\nIt is possible that events are the result of objective physical\nprocesses that we do not yet understand. These processes may determine\nthe actual outcome of experiments and not just their probabilities.\nCertainly that is the natural assumption to make. Any one who does not\nunderstand QM and many who have only a superficial understanding\nnaturally think that observations come about from some objective\nphysical process even if they think we can only predict probabilities.\nThere have been numerous attempts to develop such alternatives. These\nare often referred to as `hidden variables' theories. Bell proved that\nsuch theories cannot deal with quantum entanglement without\nintroducing explicitly nonlocal mechanisms2. Quantum entanglement\nrefers to the way observations of two particles are correlated after\nthe particles interact. It comes about because the conservation laws\nare exact but most observations are probabilistic. Nonlocal\noperations in hidden variables theories might not seem such a drawback\nsince QM itself must use explicit nonlocal mechanism to deal with\nentanglement. However in QM the non-locality is in a wave function\nwhich most do not consider to be a physical entity. This makes the\nnon-locality less offensive or at least easier to rationalize away.\nIt might seem that the tables have been turned on Einstein. The very\nargument he used in EPR to show QM must be incomplete requires that\nhidden variables models have explicit nonlocal operations. However it\nis experiments and not theoretical arguments that now must decide the\nissue. Although all experiments to date have produced results\nconsistent with the predictions of QM, there is general agreement that\nthe existing experiments are inconclusive3. There is no conclusive\nexperimental confirmation of the nonlocal predictions of QM. If these\nexperiments eventually confirm locality and not QM Einstein will be\nlargely vindicated for exactly the reasons he gave in EPR. Final\nvindication will depend on the development of a more complete theory.\nMost physicists (including Bell before his untimely death) believe QM\nis correct in predicting locality is violated. Why do they have so\nmuch more faith in the strange formalism of QM than in basic\nprinciples like locality or the notion that observations are produced\nby objective processes? I think the reason may be that they are\nviewing these problems in the wrong conceptual framework. The term\n`hidden variables' suggests a theory of classical-like particles with\nadditional hidden variables. However quantum entanglement and the\nbehavior of multi-particle systems strongly suggests that whatever\nunderlies quantum effects it is nothing like classical particles. If\nthat is so then any attempt to develop a more complete theory in this\nframework can only lead to frustration and failure. The fault may not\nbe in classical principles like locality or determinism. They failure\nmay only be in the imagination of those who are convinced that no more\ncomplete theory is possible.\nOne alternative to classical particles is to think of observations as\nfocal points in state space of nonlinear transformations of the wave\nfunction. Attractors in Chaos theory provide one model of processes\nlike this. Perhaps there is an objective physical wave function and QM\nonly models the average or statistical behavior of this wave function.\nPerhaps the structure of this physical wave function determines the\nprobability that the wave function will transform nonlinearly at a\nparticular location. If this is so then probability in QM combines two\nvery different kinds of probabilities. The first is the probability\nassociated with our state of ignorance about the detailed behavior of\nthe physical wave function. The second is the probability that the\nphysical wave function will transform with a particular focal point.\nA model of this type might be able to explain existing experimental\nresults and still never violate locality. I have advocated a class of\nmodels of this type based on using a discretized finite difference\nequation rather then a continuous differential equation to model the\nwave function4. The nonlinearity that must be introduced to discretize\nthe difference equation is a source of chaotic like behavior. In this\nmodel the enforcement of the conservation laws comes about through a\nprocess of converging to a stable state. Information that enforces\nthese laws is stored holographic-like over a wide region.\nMost would agree that the best solution to the measurement problem\nwould be a more complete theory. Where people part company is in their\nbelief in whether such a thing is possible. All attempts to prove it\nimpossible (starting with von Neumann5) have been shown to be flawed6.\nIt is in part Bell's analysis of these proofs that led to his proof\nabout locality in QM. Bell has transformed a significant part of this\nissue to one experimenters can address. If nature violates locality in\nthe way QM predicts then a local deterministic theory of the kind\nEinstein was searching for is not possible. If QM is incorrect in\nmaking these predictions then a more accurate and more complete theory\nis a necessity. Such a theory is quite likely to account for events by\nan objective physical process.\nReferences: 1 A. Einstein, B. Podolsky and N.

It recognizes that the\nimportant content of QM is the mathematical models and the ability to\napply those models to real experiments. As long as we understand the\nmodels and their application we do not need an interpretation.\nAdvocates of this position like to argue that the existing framework\nallows us to solve all real problems and that is all that is\nimportant. Franson's analysis of Aspect's experiment1 shows this is\nnot entirely true. Because there is no objective criterion in QM for\ndetermining when a measurement is complete (and hence irreversible)\nthere is no objective criterion for measuring the delays in a test of\nBell's inequality. If the demise of Schrodinger's cat may not be\ndetermined until someone looks in the box (see item 2) how are we to\nknow when a measurement in tests of Bells inequality is irreversible\nand thus measure the critical timing in these experiments?\nReferences:\n1 J.

Bohm's theory\nBohm's interpretation is an explicitly nonlocal mechanistic model.\nJust as Bohr saw the philosophical principle of complementarity as\nhaving broader implications than quantum mechanics Bohm saw a deep\nrelationship between locality violation and the wholeness or unity of\nall that exists. Bohm was perhaps the first to truly understand the\nnonlocal nature of quantum mechanics. Bell acknowledged the importance\nof Bohm's work in helping develop Bell's ideas about locality in QM.\nReferences: D.

Lawrence R. Mead rmead@whale.st.usm.ed The Transactional Interpre-\ntation of Quantum Mechanics\nThe transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics (J.G. Cramer,\nPhys. Rev. D 22, 362 (1980) ) has received little attention over the\none and one half decades since its conception. It is to be emphasized\nthat, like the Many-Worlds and other interpretations, the\ntransactional interpretation (TI) makes no new physical predictions;\nit merely reinterprets the physical content of the very same\nmathematical formalism as used in the ``standard'' textbooks, or by\nall other interpretations.\nThe following summarizes the TI. Consider a two-body system (there are\nno additional complications arising in the many-body case); the\nquantum mechanical object located at space-time point (R_1,T_1) and\nanother with which it will interact at (R_2,T_2). A quantum mechanical\nprocess governed by E=h0, conservation laws, etc., occurs between the\ntwo in the following way.\n1) The ``emitter'' (E) at (R_1,T_1) emits a retarded ``offer wave''\n(OW) \\Psi. This wave (or state vector) is an actual physical wave and\nnot (as in the Copenhagen interpretation) just a ``probability'' wave.\n2) The ``absorber'' (A) at (R_2,T_2) receives the OW and is stimulated\nto emit an advanced ``echo'' or ``confirmation wave'' (CW)\nproportional to \\Psi at R_2 backward in time; the proportionality\nfactor is \\Psi* (R_2,T_2).\n3) The advanced wave which arrives at 'E' is \\Psi \\Psi* and is\npresumed to be the probability, P, that the transaction is complete\n(ie., that an interaction has taken place).\n4) The exchange of OW's and CW's continues until a net exchange of\nenergy and other conserved quantities occurs dictated by the quantum\nboundary conditions of the system, at which point the ``transaction''\nis complete. In effect, a standing wave in space-time is set up\nbetween 'E' and 'A', consistent with conservation of energy and\nmomentum (and angular momentum). The formation of this superposition\nof advanced and retarded waves is the equivalent to the Copenhagen\n``collapse of the state vector''. An observer perceives only the\ncompleted transaction, however, which he would interpret as a single,\nretarded wave (photon, for example) traveling from 'E' to 'A'.\nQ1. When does the ``collapse'' occur?\nA1. This is no longer a meaningful question. The quantum measurement\nprocess happens ``when'' the transaction (OW sent - CW received -\nstanding wave formed with probability \\Psi \\Psi*) is finished - and\nthis happens over a space-time interval; thus, one cannot point to a\ntime of collapse, only to an interval of collapse (consistent with\nrelativity).\nQ2. Wait a moment. What you are describing is time reversal invariant.\nBut for a massive particle you have to use the Schrodinger equation\nand if \\Psi is a solution (OW), then \\Psi* is not a solution. What\ngives?\nA2. Remember that the CW must be time-reversed, and in general must be\nrelativistically invariant; ie., a solution of the Dirac equation.\nNow (eg., see Bjorken and Drell, Relativistic QM), the nonrelativistic\nlimit of that is not just the Schrodinger equation, but two\nSchrodinger equations: the time forward equation satisfied by \\Psi,\nand the time reversed Schrodinger equation (which has i --> -i) for\nwhich \\Psi* is the correct solution. Thus, \\Psi* is the correct CW for\n\\Psi as the OW.\nQ3. What about other objects in other places?\nA3. The whole process is three dimensional (space). The retarded OW is\nsent in all spatial directions. Other objects receiving the OW are\nsending back their own CW advanced waves to 'E' also. Suppose the\nreceivers are labeled 1 and 2, with corresponding energy changes E_1\nand E_2. Then the state vector of the system could be written as a\nsuperposition of waves in the standard fashion. In particular, two\npossible transactions could form: exchange of energy E_1 with\nprobability P_1=\\Psi_1 \\Psi_1*, or E_2 with probability P_2=\\Psi_2\n\\Psi_2*. Here, the conjugated waves are the advanced waves evaluated\nat the position of R_1 or R_2 respectively according to rule 3 above.\nQ4. Involving as it does an entire space-time interval, isn't this a\nnonlocal ``theory''?\nA4. Yes, indeed; it was explicitly designed that way. As you know from\nBell's theorem, no ``theory'' can agree with quantum mechanics unless\nit is nonlocal in character. In effect, the TI is a hidden variables\ntheory as it postulates a real waves traveling in space-time.\nQ5. What happens to OW's that are not ``absorbed'' ?\nA5. Inasmuch as they do not stimulate a responsive CW, they just\ncontinue to travel onward until they do. This does not present any\nproblems since in that case no energy or momentum or any other\nphysical observable is transferred.\nQ6. How about all of the standard measurement thought experiments like\nthe EPR, Schrodinger's cat, Wigner's friend, and Renninger's negative-\nresult experiment?\nA6. The interpretational difficulties with the latter three are due to\nthe necessity of deciding when the Copenhagen state reduction occurs.\nAs we saw above, in the TI there is no specific time when the\ntransaction is complete. The EPR is a completeness argument requiring\nobjective reality. The TI supplies this as well; the OW and CW are\nreal waves, not waves of probability.\nQ7. I am curious about more technical details. Can you give a further\nreference?\nA7. If you understand the theory of ``advanced'' and ``retarded''\nwaves (out of electromagnetism and optics), many of the details of TI\ncalculations can be found in: Reviews of Modern Physics, Vol. 58, July\n1986, pp. 647-687 available on the WWW as:\nhttp://mist.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_toc.html\nReferences; Saul Youssef Quantum Mechanics as Complex Probability\nTheory, hep-th 9307019.

Experiments showed that photons sent from a common source to two Swiss villages 18 kilometers apart retained their quantum connection.\nCredit: NASA\nThis might be a rare case about which Einstein was wrong. More than 60 years ago, the great physicist scoffed at the idea that anything could travel faster than light, even though quantum mechanics had suggested such a condition. Now four Swiss researchers have brought the possibility closer to reality. Testing a concept called \"spooky action at a distance\"--a phrase used by Einstein in criticizing the phenomenon--they have shown that two subatomic particles can communicate nearly instantaneously, even if they are separated by cosmic distances.\nAlice's Wonderland had nothing on quantum physics, which describes a bizarre state of matter and energy. Not only can the same atom exist in two locations at once, but merely attempting to observe a particle will alter its properties. Perhaps least intuitive is the characteristic called entanglement. As described by quantum mechanics, it means that two entangled particles can keep tabs on each other no matter how far apart they are. Physicists have been trying for decades to determine whether this property is real and what might cause it. In the process, they've uncovered evidence for it but not much about its properties.\nPhysicist Nicolas Gisin and colleagues at the University of Geneva in Switzerland split off pairs of quantum-entangled photons and sent them from the university's campus through two fiber-optic cables to two Swiss villages located 18 kilometers apart. Thinking of the photons like traffic lights, each passed through specially designed detectors that determined what \"color\" they were when entering the cable and what color they appeared to be when they reached the terminus. The experiments revealed two things: First, the physical properties of the photons changed identically during their journey, just as predicted by quantum theory--when one turned \"red,\" so did the other. Second, there was no detectable time difference between when those changes occurred in the photons, as though an imaginary traffic controller had signaled them both.\nThe result, the team reports in tomorrow's issue of Nature, is that whatever was affecting the photons seems to have happened nearly instantaneously and that according to their calculations, the phenomenon influencing the particles had to be traveling at least 10,000 times faster than light. Given Einstein's standard speed limit on light traveling within conventional spacetime, the experiments show that entanglement might be controlled by something existing beyond it. Gisin says that once the scientific community \"accepts that nature has this ability, we should try to create models that explain it.\"\nAlthough the research doesn't demonstrate spooky action at a distance directly, it does provide \"a lower boundary for the speed\" necessary for the phenomenon, says theoretical physicist Martin Bojowald of Pennsylvania State University in State College. Cosmologist Sean Carroll of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena says that it's \"yet another experiment that tells us quantum mechanics is right\" and that there \"really is an intrinsic connection between entangled particles, not that some signal passes quickly between them when an observation is performed.\" And physicist Lorenza Viola of Dartmouth College says there's much more to be determined. \"I am sure we are not finished unveiling what the quantum [effects] due to entanglement really are and how powerful they can be.\"\n"}, {"score": 2603.626, "uuid": "36b6fdfc-af65-5600-90ee-65001c61d4ae", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1601wb-88-16644", "target_hostname": "www.digitalphilosophy.org", "target_uri": "http://www.digitalphilosophy.org/Home/Papers/DigitalMechanics/Chapter18Quantummechanicsandcommonsense/tabid/125/Default.aspx", "page_rank": 1.5551295e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Chapter 18: <em>Quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em> <em>and</em> common sense", "snippet": "This <em>difference</em> in <em>the</em> concept of causality leads us to hope that one might not need to separate <em>the</em> results of <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em> from simple common sense.", "explanation": null, "document": "Papers\n18.

But thereafter they ignore it, and apparently assume that student misconceptions when learning quantum mechanics are not connected with foundational issues. I argue the contrary, that Feynman's statement should be a central concern in all efforts to improve quantum pedagogy. If we teachers do not understand a topic, we pass our own misconceptions on to our students and make the subject much more difficult for them.\nMany conceptual difficulties, including those Feynman was referring to, arise from the problem of introducing probabilities into quantum theory in a useful and consistent way. Textbooks avoid the problem by assigning probabilities to macroscopic measurement outcomes rather than to microscopic quantum systems. Although that approach avoids inconsistencies, it gives rise to some serious misconceptions: Measurements are somehow special and unrelated to other quantum phenomena; they require a \"classical\" apparatus that functions outside the scope of quantum mechanics (where is one to find such a thing nowadays?); they produce physical effects at long distances; one can say nothing sensible about what a quantum system is doing in the absence of measurements; measurements can be used to predict the future of the measured system but tell us nothing about its past; and so forth. These misconceptions are not unrelated to those that Singh and coauthors have reported.\nStudents learning quantum mechanics could benefit greatly if their instructors used advances in our understanding that have occurred during the 40 years since Feynman unashamedly confessed his perplexity. He seems to have reacted favorably to a preliminary version of the new ideas (see the letter from Murray Gell-Mann and James Hartle in PHYSICS TODAY, February 1999, page 11), so he might have appreciated the more mature form now available. In brief, we now know how to consistently assign probabilities directly to microscopic systems without referring to measurements, and we can show that under appropriate conditions a properly constructed measurement apparatus, described in fully quantum terms, will reveal properties the measured system possessed before the measurement took place. In such circumstances the probabilities of measurement outcomes are the same as those of the measured properties, and measurements are no longer an essential conceptual tool: One can think directly in physical terms about what the quantum system is doing at different times. This gets rid of a major source of student difficulties and misconceptions.\nConsider the example reported by Singh and coauthors in which students used a calculation employing \u27e8A\u27e9\u00a0=\u00a0\u27e8\u03c8|A|\u03c8\u27e9 to find the expectation of an observable A, rather than simply using a probability distribution they had worked out previously. (In that article, A was the energy, but the same principle applies to any observable.) This failure is not surprising given that textbooks lack a good discussion of how to assign probability distributions to observables. So the student memorizes an independent formula \u27e8A\u27e9\u00a0=\u00a0\u27e8\u03c8|A|\u03c8\u27e9, which is a good way of calculating something that comes up in homework and exams, but whose physical significance is not particularly clear (to student or instructor). What the student should be taught is that A is the quantum counterpart of a random variable in ordinary probability theory, and its average can be obtained from its probability distribution in exactly the same way. Defining \u27e8A\u27e9 in this manner before introducing \u27e8\u03c8|A|\u03c8\u27e9 as a convenient formula for calculating it would make things clearer. But quantum textbooks do not contain the necessary tools, and for good reason. With two noncommuting observables A and B, it is easy to poke either of them into the \u27e8\u03c8|A|\u03c8\u27e9 formula, whereas assigning probabilities leads into a vast swamp, which work on quantum foundations has shown to be filled with nasty paradoxes ready to bite the unwary. Retreating to macroscopic measurements allows textbook writers to avoid the swamp, but with a serious loss in clarity of thought and physical intuition. It is better to drain the swamp of its root cause: a failed attempt to meld classical and quantum modes of reasoning, instead of consistently applying quantum concepts at all levels, microscopic and macroscopic, which is something we now know how to do.\nAnother misconception reported in the PHYSICS TODAY article, that measurement of a physical observable causes the system to be stuck forever in the measured eigenstate, is hardly surprising when students are taught that measurements and wavefunction collapse are part of the axiomatic, and thus unanalyzable, structure of quantum theory. Instead, they need to think about measurements as quantum physical processes, governed by the same laws as the rest of the quantum world, and learn how to use conditional probabilities to relate measurement outcomes to the past as well as the future behavior of a measured system. Once again, outdated ideas make the subject harder to learn.\nFor 10 years I have been teaching advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate quantum mechanics courses and courses in quantum information, using the new perspective in which quantum mechanics is based on probabilistic laws of universal validity, with measurements being only one application. Reactions have generally been positive, though the students show signs of shock when I tell them that by the end of the course, provided they do their homework, they will understand some aspects of quantum mechanics better than Feynman did. Presenting the new ideas takes somewhat longer than the material they replace, but not enormously so. Some time will be regained in courses that include an introduction to quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen, since circuitous arguments invoking Bell's inequality and the like, which can leave students quite confused, are replaced by a short, clear treatment of the essentials.\nAlthough I can see the value of computer simulations of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, I think it is more effective to first introduce students to basic quantum dynamics, both unitary and stochastic, through the use of \"toy models.\" I included various examples in Consistent Quantum Theory. 1 The properties of such models are easily worked out with a pencil on a small sheet of paper, like the back of an envelope. Working through them helps students master new concepts and get rid of certain misconceptions about quantum measurements.\nThe fact that students in my courses have been able to learn how to apply probabilities consistently to microscopic systems, in a way that disposes of numerous difficulties and conceptual paradoxes, suggests it might be worthwhile for other teachers to invest some time in learning post-Feynman ideas. The main difficulty is the absence of a textbook. I have used reference 1 as a supplement, though it is not ideal. It has no exercises, although a few are available on the corresponding website. I would be happy to hear from anyone skilled in textbook writing who wants to revise an older one or start something new.\nIn conclusion, I strongly favor every effort to improve students' understanding of quantum mechanics, and I consider the research reported by Singh and coauthors a valuable contribution to that end. However, if we want our students to genuinely understand quantum mechanics and not simply calculate things, I believe a much bigger step forward is possible by combining the efforts reported in the article with advances in quantum foundations.\nReference\n1. R. B. Griffiths, Consistent Quantum Theory, Cambridge U. Press, New York (2002). Some chapters and a few exercises are available at [LINK] .\nRobert B. Griffiths\nCarnegie Mellon University\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nIn their article, Chandralekha Singh, Mario Belloni, and Wolfgang Christian focus exclusively on \"functional understanding of quantum mechanics,\" which they claim \"is quite distinct from the foundational issues alluded to by Feynman.\"\nBut are the foundational and the functional really so distinct? The work of other physics education researchers suggests not. For example, in a classic article, Alan Van Heuvelen discusses students' prevalent and frustrating use of \"primitive formula-centered problem-solving strategies\" 1 and suggests that physical, intuitive understanding developed through qualitative diagrams and models \"must come before students start using math in problem solving. The equations become crutches that short-circuit attempts at understanding.\" Van Heuvelen also urges that \"instead of thinking of [problems] as an effort to determine some unknown quantity, [teachers] might .\u00a0.\u00a0. encourage students to think of the problem statement as describing a physical process\u0097a movie of a region of space during a short time interval or of an event at one instant of time.\" I suspect Singh, Belloni, and Christian would agree with this advice. They comment that such \"qualitative understanding of quantum mechanics is much more challenging than facility with the technical aspects.\"\nBut isn't the main barrier to such intuitive, qualitative understanding the nature of quantum mechanics itself\u0097at least, the version of the theory advocated by Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and virtually every textbook writer since? Why should we expect students to invest the time and energy necessary to, say, visualize the time-dependence of |\u03c8|2 when we also preach the ambiguous and contradictory Copenhagen dogma that \u03c8 does not represent anything physically real, yet still provides a complete description of physical reality? Why are we surprised that students are confused about, and don't take seriously, something that we assure them is, at best, some kind of algorithmic fantasy? Is there really any difference between \"shut up and calculate\" and \"plug and chug\"?\nWhy not teach them Bohmian mechanics\u0097an alternative (deterministic) version of quantum theory in which particles are particles (and really exist, all the time) and the same dynamical laws apply whether anyone is looking or not? 2 About this alternative theory John S. Bell asked, \"Why is [it] ignored in text books? Should it not be taught .\u00a0.\u00a0. as an antidote to the prevailing complacency? To show that vagueness, subjectivity, and indeterminism are not forced upon us by experimental facts, but by deliberate theoretical choice?\" 3\nIf we really want to help students understand quantum mechanics, the first step is to reject the confusion-spawning foundational vagueness, ambiguity, and philosophical absurdity of Copenhagen quantum theory, and adopt a clearer, more scientific, less fuzzy version. (See Sheldon Goldstein's two-part article \"Quantum Theory Without Observers,\" PHYSICS TODAY, March 1998, page 42, and April 1998, page 38.) The first step, in short, is to present them with a theory that can be understood.\nReferences\n1. A. Van Heuvelen, Am. J. Phys. 59, 891 (1991) [SPIN] .\n2. S.

Press, New York (2004), p. 173.\nTravis Norsen\nMarlboro College\nMarlboro, Vermont\nA quite different approach from the one presented by the authors of \"Improving Students' Understanding of Quantum Mechanics\" may be appropriate at least for some classes of students. It might be called the pragmatic approach, teaching students to deal with a wide variety of problems while minimizing philosophical discussion. I took this approach for several years while teaching a course for graduate engineers at Stanford. 1 The resulting course was surprisingly orthogonal to the traditional quantum course. Solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation became a minimal part of the subject; rather, tight-binding expansions allowed the student to use simple algebra to obtain a meaningful understanding of atoms, molecules, and solids. Transition rates and shake-off excitations provided understanding of a wide variety of phenomena.\nI took the defensible stance that all of quantum mechanics is the direct consequence of a single assertion, wave\u2013particle duality. The uncertainty principle and the Pauli principle are consequences, not independent conjectures. Quantum theory does not tell us that there will be a particle of spin with the mass and charge of an electron, but it indicates how such a particle will behave if there is one. When the consequences seem puzzling, it is fair to say that one is simply having difficulty with the starting assertion.\nReference\n1. W. A. Harrison, Applied Quantum Mechanics, World Scientific, River Edge, NJ (2000).\nWalter A. Harrison\nStanford University\nStanford, California\nAuthors Singh, Belloni, and Christian demonstrate how visualizations can help students learn some of the most difficult and counterintuitive principles in the physics curriculum. But as two surveys have shown, there are broader roles for computation in that curriculum that ought to be, but currently are generally not being, used to help prepare physics students for their likely work environments.\nAn August 2002 survey by the American Institute of Physics (available at http://aip.org/statistics/trends/reports/bachplus5.pdf ) looked at physics bachelor graduates in the nonacademic workplace at least five years beyond their graduation. The results revealed a significant gap between their computational preparation as undergraduates and the computational demands of their work. The AIP survey does not detail these demands, but from my own experiences in engineering research and development environments, I've found that they include constructing and validating numerical models as well as interpreting results from running those models. In short, holders of physics bachelor's degrees must be able to think about their physics in computational terms.\nThe other survey, completed by Robert Fuller from the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln, provides some answers to how much computation is included in today's physics curricula of colleges and universities nationwide. The answers indicate wide variability in the degree of computation amid a widespread agreement by faculty on the importance of integrating computation into their courses. Fuller concludes that physics departments in the US generally acknowledge the need for more computation in their curricula, but most are not meeting the need in a systematic way. This gap\u0097between acknowledged need and community response\u0097is consistent with AIP's survey findings. The September/October 2006 issue of Computing in Science and Engineering gives Fuller's report and provides some examples of possible ways to close the gap. They include the \"lone wolf\" who is the sole interested person in the department; the \"persuasive pioneer,\" implementer of a full computational physics undergraduate major; and a range of cases in between.\nI believe the physics community needs to reconceive the canon of the undergraduate physics curriculum to include a significant role for computation. Whether or not they learn their physics principles with computation embedded, students will need to put their knowledge to productive use in their work. Today that usually means through computation.\nNorman Chonacky\n\"Computing in Science and Engineering\"\nNew Haven, Connecticut\nIn their article \"Improving Students' Understanding of Quantum Mechanics,\" the authors present the following survey question: \"By definition, the Hamiltonian acting on any allowed state of the system \u03a8 will give the same state back, i.e., H\u03a8 = E\u03a8.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Explain why you agree or disagree.\" This wording appears to be ambiguous, since an \"allowed state of the system\" seems to connote an eigenstate. Perhaps better wording would be \"the Hamiltonian acting on any wavefunction \u03a8,\" or even better, \"acting on a wavefunction \u03a8 in Hilbert space,\" rather than referring to the state as \"allowed.\"\nPhilip Shemella\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute\nTroy, New York\nI have found the recent articles on improving physics education very helpful\u0097please keep them coming! Although I am a physics undergraduate looking toward a future in research, such articles have influenced me at least as much as your articles on physics innovations.\nI was very lucky to have an outstanding advanced placement physics teacher. His explanations and guidance were simple yet effective, and he led the class through his entire thought process when working out examples. Although most of the students were not going into physics or engineering, almost all were able to understand the material. His brilliant instruction was one of the factors that made me choose to be a physics major.\nOn the other hand, I am privy to the horror stories of my friends taking introductory physics for science majors under other instructors. The range of experiences, from stunning to devastating, have encouraged me to focus on teaching as well as research. Please, keep the physics education articles coming. At a time when our country is facing a lack of science education, how physics is taught may be one of the most important areas to study.\nMichael Saelim\nMichigan State University\nEast Lansing\nSingh, Belloni, and Christian reply: We appreciate the number and quality of the responses to our article. They indicate a strong interest, which we share, in the teaching of upper-level courses such as quantum mechanics. Our article focused on the concept of time evolution to illustrate a variety of difficulties students face; we barely scratched the surface of the breadth and depth of teaching and learning issues in a standard quantum mechanics course.\nWe value highly the perspectives on fundamental issues from Robert Griffiths and Travis Norsen, who raised similar concerns from different viewpoints. Foundational issues in quantum mechanics are not emphasized in most undergraduate or graduate quantum mechanics curricula. Griffiths has argued that the lack of proper grounding in foundational issues is the source of many student misconceptions in quantum mechanics. The consistent histories approach 1 or Bohm's interpretation 2 may be conceptually \"cleaner,\" but our research has shown that many of the difficulties\u0097for example, the confusion between the time-independent and time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation\u0097are not foundational but conceptual.\nAs a practical matter, non-Copenhagen interpretations are not widely incorporated in quantum mechanics textbooks. We have argued that there are ways to improve student understanding within the current framework\u0097surely, these general methods will work if and when the physics community has collectively adopted new ways of thinking about quantum mechanics.\nPhysics education research is well-established now, and a controlled study involving two quantum mechanics classes taught by the same instructor might be worthwhile. One class could use the standard Copenhagen interpretation while the other uses the consistent histories approach. An important question, then, is this: If both classes cover approximately the same amount of material and students in both classes are given the surveys we have developed, do students in one class significantly outperform those in the other? In addition to the written surveys, a subset of students from both classes could be interviewed to further ascertain their level of understanding. If students using the consistent histories approach significantly outperform those learning the standard Copenhagen interpretation, it may be worthwhile to develop interactive tutorials similar to those discussed in the article but using the consistent histories approach.\nIn response to Travis Norsen, we note that we agree with Alan Van Heuvelen, whom Norsen cites, and our approach is consistent with his advice. 3 However, intuition and foundational issues are not exactly the same things. Although a deep understanding of foundational issues may improve intuition, we can help our students develop qualitative, conceptual understanding of many aspects of quantum theory without first having to clarify every foundational issue. Our research suggests that the nature of physical intuition is not well understood, though intuition is important. 4\nAs Philip Shemella has suggested, we have used other wordings for the question of interest, including the wording he recommends. Our findings are unchanged. During interviews, the interviewer has often rephrased the question when a student was unable to answer correctly. The responses were qualitatively unchanged.\nAs Griffiths, Norsen, and Walter Harrison imply, the use of simulations and results from physics education research to address functional issues is just a single prong in what should be a multi-pronged approach to the teaching of quantum mechanics. We agree that addressing foundational issues is just as important.\nIn addition to the approach taken in textbooks by Griffiths and Harrison, Richard Robinett's quantum text 5 relates pedagogical quantum models to modern experimental realizations of these systems and emphasizes connections to classical mechanics.\nWe agree with Norman Chonacky that a discussion of the broader role of computation in the physics curriculum is needed. We encourage interested readers to attend the American Association of Physics Teachers topical conference Computational Physics for Upper Level Courses, to be held in July 2007 (see http://www.opensourcephysics.org/CPC/index.html ). Its purpose is to identify problems in which computation helps students understand key physics concepts.\nReferences\n1. R. B. Griffiths, Consistent Quantum Theory, Cambridge U.

I am by no means an expert but after looking into both sides it seems like he is one step ahead of the other guys and on the right path IMHO. This is a quick overview of the website but please look into what else he has to say, his arguments are very in-depth. If correct, the philosophical implications of what he has found are quite profound.\nQuote:\nA Very Short Summary of the Wave Structure of Matter!\nFirst the error then the simple solution.\nThe Error relates to the metaphysical foundations of Physics, Newton's Mechanics, which tried to describe an interconnected dynamic reality in terms of many discrete inert matter 'particles'. This then required the invention of 'forces / fields' to connect the motion of these 'mass' particles in 'absolute space' and 'absolute time'. Newton (and Einstein) realised that this was just a mathematical solution that did not explain how matter is interconnected across the universe.\nThe solution is obvious once known - just replace the motion of discrete matter particles in space and time with the wave motion of space that causes matter and time. (Schrodinger,Wolff,Haselhurst,WSM theorists). A series of spherical waves that flow in and out through the wave center form a spherical standing wave around this central point in space - the wave center that forms the 'particle'. The spherical in and out waves are both necessarily connected to, and in continual two way communication with all other matter (waves) in the space around them. Matter is a wave structure of the universe. (The wave structure of matter (WSM) is explained in more detail in the physics section below.) To keep this as short as possible I have not included quotes from the philosophers and scientists that support these truth statements. Instead I have linked to the relevant pages where you will find the quotes and a summary of their ideas. I have separated the truth statements by subject - with an explanation at the end of each section. However, our minds are feeble and take time to adjust to new knowledge, you will find this much easier to understand with a second reading. The world around you does exist - the underlying foundations of this physical reality are simple once known - just space and its wave motions. The complications come from our mind, that our senses deceive us into seeing solid separate bodies when in fact there is nothing but waves in space.\nGeoff Haselhurst\nSubject: Re: Quantum mechanics: the wave structure of matter\nWed 12 May 2010, 10:50 pm\nI have never been able to get my head around the entire quantum physics discussion. But I'm certainly interested.\nDo you know if there are any video depicting these spherical waves he is talking about, as I don't seem to be able to visualize them.\nAlso, is there a good documentary around that discussed Schrodinger,Wolff, Haselhurst, and the WSM theorists in simplistic terms?\nI'd like to get to the point where I can understand the theories and how they're twisting them to their own advantage.\n_________________\n\"For every thousand hacking at the leaves of evil, there is one striking at the root.\"\nDavid Thoreau (1817-1862)\nSubject: Re: Quantum mechanics: the wave structure of matter\nFri 14 May 2010, 2:54 pm\nI don't know of any good videos or documentaries unfortunately, I visualize the standing spherical waves as a sonar pattern moving out from a center point in a perfect circle or really a sphere if it was viewed in 3d space.\nThe difference between this theory and the mainstream theory is that mainstream quantum physics looks at \"particles\" as having properties of both a particle and a wave, this theory states that they are simply waves and there is no duality or confusion with how they act when you consider that they are simply waves.\nThere are also large pieces of quantum physics that mainstream physicists admit to not understanding (I don't think anyone would disagree that it is still a highly theoretical science), such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and this theory claims to be able make sense of those irregularities.\nIt makes sense to me from a human perspective when you consider that the particle itself was only \"discovered\" theoretically and quantum physics is the science of trying to understand how these particles interact with each other. What they have been finding hasn't exactly lined up with how they thought a particle \"should\" act, so they say it has a duality nature where it will act like both a particle and a wave - only when they say \"wave\" they are comparing it to other waves, and when they say \"particle\" they are comparing it to a theoretical idea of a particle.\nThe wave structure of matter is really a simple view of quantum physics and really physics in general, however it is difficult to grasp because of assumptions humans have in regard to the world we live in. In classical physics the universe is a very complex place, you have vast areas of empty space, different forces such as gravity, magnetic, etc., and different types o objects - solids, liquids, gases, etc.\nIn the wave structure of matter theory, it is all simplified. What we consider to be empty space is actually the fabric or medium for all other things. Waves are traveling through this medium creating the complexity that we see as the universe. Instead of different forces that follow different rules, they are all they same (gravity, electromagnetic waves, light, etc.) they are all waves with varying degrees of amplitude and frequency. The idea of a particle would be the center point of these waves.\nThis goes against the idea that we have separate bodies in space with \"nothing\" between them - they would be connected, all things would be connected. Philosophical arguments of the mind being separate from reality, or able to exist independent of reality would become moot due to how everything is connected.\nIt does make me think that all life could be part of some greater consciousness, or linked together in a subconscious way.\nSubject: Re: Quantum mechanics: the wave structure of matter\nFri 14 May 2010, 6:32 pm\nCheck this out\nSubject: Re: Quantum mechanics: the wave structure of matter\nMon 17 May 2010, 10:10 am\nKraig wrote:\nIt does make me think that all life could be part of some greater consciousness, or linked together in a subconscious way.\nI don't have enough knowledge about this topic to comment meaningfully, but this direction always makes me nervous.

This is meant to provide you alternative insight about this direction of everything being connected.\n\"We're migrating from a spiritual framework of God working through the individual to a framework where a force acts upon us collectively and externally. This is part of the transition from the individual, as an image of the spirit which has primacy, to an external force where the individual is nothing more than a node in the collective, and the collective has primacy. This is why the transition to \"New Age\" paradigms, as its an essential element in the suppressing of individual human life. Albert Pike starts us down this road in his book, Morals & Dogma (pg 102).\"\n_________________\n\"For every thousand hacking at the leaves of evil, there is one striking at the root.\"\nDavid Thoreau (1817-1862)\nSubject: Re: Quantum mechanics: the wave structure of matter\nMon 17 May 2010, 11:43 am\nWell it is just a thought I have, not much more. I do think this knowledge will fundamentally change humanity in a way that the current way of understanding quantum physics will be viewed in the same way that the idea that the world is flat is viewed now.\nThe flat earth theory is a really good example because it shows how a simple observation that turns into an assumption can be completely different than reality - yet even after knowing the truth, if you look at the horizon it still looks pretty flat.\nWhen you have something like a desk, it of course seems like it is a solid object. So when you start studying the atoms that make up the desk, you would assume that the atoms themselves are also solid objects or have mass - because the desk does. That is why current quantum physics has it so wrong, that are going off of assumptions of what a solid object is and what empty space is. They are looking for an explanation of their assumptions rather than looking for what is really in front of them.\nSo now we have found out that the atoms that make up the desk, or the protons and electrons actually do not have mass. They are not solid objects, they are waves, signals, or energy - passing through what we thought was empty space, but it's really not so empty. So how is it that the desk feels like a solid object? At this point I have to think that it is our mind that allows us to perceive it as a solid object - for both the desk and our own mind and body are waves.\nIt also seems clear to me that I am not living in my own personal mind-simulation. There are rules that apply to all of us, limitations of this \"physical\" world. If it is my mind saying to me via my senses that my hand cannot pass through this desk, how is it that your mind has the same rules? It seems like there would have to be something controlling it from a bigger perspective, which is what I meant by a greater consciousness, or God, who knows.\nAs I said I don't know where this will lead, but I don't think it has to be a suppression of the individual, I actually see it as the opposite of that. We might be connected, but it is still clear that we are different people, living different experiences, and making different choices that lead to further differences of experience based on the choices we make. Society already is setup to where collective has primacy, that is what democracy is all about, which is also what the current propagandized understanding of \"freedom\" is all about, because of course you can't have freedom without democracy. Even outside of democracy, government in general is based on screwing the individual for the sake of some obscure idea of the greater good, or the collective. This is government ideology that dominates the world.\nHaving a collective isn't the same thing as having an existence that is necessarily connected because I think \"collective\" implies that you have completely separate individuals rounded up and turned into the collective. It implies that you have nodes to be sacrificed, and the collective can be okay or even better off because of their suffering. It is very important that the nodes are separated, becuase if they are not when you sacrifice one it could have a harmful effect on the others.\nA connected existence wouldn't be the same thing, because you can't isolate anything, you can isolate a node and screw him over without it having some effect on everything else. You can't enslave and violate one region of people and then have a society that is paradise in another other because they are connected. You can't pollute the air and the earth and then lock it up in some kind of magical box or region and not have it effect everything else. You can't screw over an individual without it having some effect on your own individuality. I think this really applies to the USA because for decades they have been screwing over people in other countries while thinking they lived in the freest country in the world at the same time. Now as it turns out the consequences of that power are starting to make WWII Germany look like a cake walk in some ways when compared to the current USA.\nThat's just where my thinking has been going on this.\n"}, {"score": 2581.4495, "uuid": "cf6866e3-b036-5a33-a565-11a3aa4629c2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1811wb-94-24084", "target_hostname": "www.physlib.com", "target_uri": "http://www.physlib.com/quantum_mechanics.html", "page_rank": 1.1817228e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Introduction to <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>", "snippet": "In <em>what</em> shell around <em>the</em> nucleus <em>the</em> electron <em>is</em>. n <em>The</em> orbital <em>quantum</em> number.

There where problems with classical mechanics, dealing with energy.\nBLACK BODY RADIATION\nA black body is a idealized object that should be a perfect absorber of electromagnetic waves (light for example) meaning it would absorb all electromagnetic waves of all frequencies, in contrast to say a red object that absorb only wave lengths which doesn't correspond to red light, thereby only emitting light from the red spectrum. A box (or any cavity at all) will serve as a good example of a black body since the radiation won't get out of the box, you can say that it has been absorbed by the box:\nYou have a box, the box is filled with electromagnetic waves, which constitutes the temperature inside the box. Now, lets try to divide up the total energy inside the box between the various numbers of electromagnetic waves that would be inside such a box:\nFirst the frequency of the waves can't have any number at all, the waves has to fit between both sides of the box and have a whole number wave length. Then we first have one large wave stretching from one side of the box to the next with one peak, then we can have a wave with two peaks in the same space, three and so on. You can cram what ever amount of peaks between the walls you want, there's no end to it, so there is a infinite numbers of possible waves, with the frequency becoming larger and larger. Now we have an infinite amount of possible waves and since the black body should treat all waves equal, not favoring any of them, the energy has to be divided up equally between all the possible waves. The dilemma is that no matter how small portion of the total energy you give to each wave, because of the total wave number being infinite the energy will also be infinite.\nTHE SPIRALLING ELECTRON\nElectrons orbit the nucleus. This is a well know fact and without it atoms wouldn't exist. Still this isn't possible according to classical physics, instead the electron would lose energy and begin to spiral toward the nucleus. This has to do with the Maxwell's equations (they describe what happens to electromagnetic fields). They say that an electric charge (the electron for example) that is in a non-uniform motion (a.k.a its speed or the direction of its speed changes) should radiate. Therefore an electron, which is going in a circular orbit around the nucleus and therefore has a changing direction of motion, would radiate away its energy, starting to move in a spiraling path until it reaches the nucleus.\nTHE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT\nIn a metal there are electrons, which is very loosely tied to the metal, and when you shine light of the metal the light will knockoff electrons. This means that the light gives of energy to the electrons in the metal thereby making it possible for them to escape. And the more energy the light has, logically the more energy the knocked off electrons will have. This was known, but it was thought that the energy in a light wave depended on two things:\n1. The intensity (amplitude) of the light wave.\n2. The frequency of the light wave.\nThese two together decided what the energy level of the wave would be. That means that if you have a wave with certain energy you could turn down the frequency and turn up the intensity and you would have a wave with the exact same energy level as your original wave, there would be no difference. And then neither would there be any difference in the energy of the electron that was knocked off the metal. But scientists found to their great surprise that only if they turned up the frequency of the light was the energy level of the electrons affected. Instead if they turned up the intensity the number of electrons which where knocked off raised.\nTHE COMPTON EFFECT\nIt was discovered that if you send X-rays toward certain materials the X-rays would loose energy after refraction. And that the steeper angle the incoming X-rays had, the more energy they would loose. This couldn't be understood using a wave model of light.\nTHE SOLUTIONS\nBLACK BODY RADIATION\nIn the wave model of the black body radiation, each electromagnetic wave could carry and arbitrary small amount of the total energy. Which then would lead to an infinite total energy. The man who resolved this, and is considered a founder of quantum mechanics, was Max Planck. He proposed that energy couldn't take on an arbitrary value, but had to come in quanta's or packages which had a specific whole number value and that value depended on the frequency of the wave in question. So now the energy was in packages, which had a minimum energy value. And as we move up to waves with higher and higher frequencies, the quanta also gets a higher energy. But here's the point; when the waves frequency become so high that its quanta's energy exceeds the energy which the energy field they belong to have (e.g. the energy in the box), then it gets counted out. Meaning that quanta's which has to high energies isn't allowed and therefore doesn't come into existence.\nTHE SPIRALLING ELECTRON\nThe problem was that the electron would continuously loose energy and spiral toward the nucleus. But if you quantisize energy, the electron can't loose it continuously. It has to loose it in specific quanta's or not loose it at all. This would keep the electron from slowly spiralling inward, and it explains how it can only jump from one orbit to another. But how does it decide which orbits are allowed, that is were there positions are around the nucleus? At first there wasn't any mechanism for this, but it was found that it could be explained by so called standing waves. A standing wave is when two waves traveling in the opposite direction meet and then create the impression of a wave that is standing still but oscillating:\nThe grey wave moves to the right and the black wave to the left. So they together would look Like one oscillating wave.\nIf you the treat the electron as a wave which produce an standing wave around the nucleus, it can create different interference patterns. A interference pattern arrise when two waves overlap each other.\nAn interference pattern can either be destructive, that's when the peaks and troughs of each wave are turned in opposite direction (as in the pic above). Or reinforcing, when they are turned in the same direction.\nWhen you have the electrons round orbit around the nucleus, the standing wave it produce would also have to be wrapped in a circular shape around the nucleus. It was found that in order not to create a destructive but reinforcing interference pattern when the standing wave was wrapped around the nucleus, the number of oscillations had to be a whole number: 1, 2, 3 etc. If the number of oscillations where a fractal; 1.1, 2.2, 3.3 etc there would be a destructive interference. Thereby the orbits couldn't be anywere around the nucleus, but only at certain positions were they form standing wave with a whole number oscillations. Since if the interference pattern is destructive that orbit is forbidden, since it would be unstable, and nature always strives for stability.\nTHE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT\nThis one can be understood by thinking of light as be made up be photons. The energy of a photon depends only on its frequency(as stated in the black body radiation) and when you turn up the frequency of the light beam you turn up the frequency of the photons in it there by giving them higher energy, and the higher energy they have the more energy can be given to the electrons that they hit, making them more energetic. But if you turn up the intensity of the light beam you turn up the number of photons that is emitted, so a higher amount of photons will hit a higher amount of electrons thereby creating a larger number of electrons being knocked of from the metal.\nTHE COMPTON EFFECT\nIt's easy to see if we consider the X-rays to be made out of particles and the X-ray particles hit the electrons in the material. Then we can treat the X-ray particles as ordinary balls, if you roll a ball directly toward another ball in a head-on collision, it will loose allot of the energy that you originally put into it when you gave it the push. Instead if you roll the ball from a plane angle so it just brushes against the other ball it won't loose that much energy at all.\nIS IT A WAVE? IS IT A PARTICLE? NO IT'S\nSUPERMAN!\n(Or maby wave-partilce duality would be more appropriate)\nAs we've seen from the above examples light and electromagnetic waves in general has to behave like particles, if theory will match reality. But does this mean that light is particles? There is an experiment produced by a fellow named Young, called the double slit experiment. It involves a screen that doesn't let through any light; two parallel slits are cut in it:\nAnd a light source put behind the screen so that light passes through the slits and gets projected against a white screen. If we covered over one stripe is easy to see that on the white screen we would see one bright spot, from the light coming out of the open slit. But if we uncovered the other slit, instead of seeing two bright spots bright and dark stripes would appear, a so-called interference pattern.\nWhy is that?\nIt's easy to understand this if you think of light as waves. As the original wave from the light source goes trough the two slits, it's just as two independent new waves arise from the two slits. Those two waves consist of peaks and troughs, and as the two waves spread out there peaks and troughs will meet, then two basic things can happen:\n1. Two peaks or troughs from each wave can overlap each other. Then they'll reinforce one another, creating a bright stripe.\n2. One peak and one trough from each wave can overlap each other. Then they'll cancel each other out, creating a dark stripe.\nBeneath is a picture showing two peaks overlapping and therefore creating a bright stripe. The red circles are where the two slits are and where the waves come out. The green circle is where the two peaks overlap. To illustrate a dark stripe, where a peak and a trough overlap, simply turn one wave around so the two peaks that now point in the same direction point in opposite.\nNow you should see why there are stripes. Below is a final picture showing the interference pattern. It's a bit difficult understanding what it shows, so you probably have to read this through a couple of times. Lets start from the bottom: First there's a dark grey area, this is a peak. Then a black line that is a border between a peak and a trough and then a light grey area, which is a trough (never mind the meaning of dark and light grey areas as peaks and troughs the meaning of the grey areas will change later, but black lines are still borders). Now, the second black line is a bit different, that's the screen with the slits, the slits being the two openings in it. And from those two openings the two \"new\" waves that create the interference pattern arise. Now remember; the following section is basically divided using black lined half circles, on one side of a black line half circle there's a peak on the other side there's a trough, lets start by saying that the first area emerging from the slit to the left (the area between the left slit opening and the following black lined half circle) is a peak(try to ignore the lines cutting through it), the next one above that is a trough. And it's the next one, the trough that is interesting. Since emerging from the slit right of it is also first a peak and above that a trough. If you follow those two troughs you'll see that they intersect and where they intersect there's a dark grey area (it's right between the two slits and shaped kind of like an egg). This grey are where the two troughs reinforce each other and bright stripe will be.\nLets keep focused one the same left trough as before. On the right side of it, above the trough that we used to earlier there is of course a peak if we follow that peak to where is intersect the trough on the left side, we find a light grey area. This light grey area is where the peak and the trough cancel each other out and creates a dark stripe.\nIf you continue like this, finding the peaks and troughs and see where they intersect, and remember that dark grey areas are where they reinforce and light grey is where they cancel. You'll find the same pattern as the picture shows.\nNow you might ask if this wave isn't made up by the particles, the photon, much like a water wave is made up by atom. This way light would still be trusty old particles traveling in groups that behave like waves.\nThat's easy to test (easy and easy with the right equipment), you turn down the intensity on the light source to just firing one photon, say every second. If we then considered light to be classical particles this would, create just two bright spots of the screen, since the particle now wouldn't have anything to interact with and creating the interference pattern. But what we see now is rather strange; if we say that each photon leaves like a little burn mark where it hits the white screen, and if we left the machine going for quite some time, the same pattern will arise. That's strange, it's as if the photon went through both slits and interacted with it self! This can only be possible if you consider the photon as waves. And in fact you can say that the photons in the light beam, going through the slits doesn't interact with each other they only interact with them self! But there's another troubling thing that we can do to make quantum mechanics even more strange: If we place a photon detector at the screen which examines the way the single photon will go, then the interference patter will disappear. And this is not because the detector blocks of the slit or something, it's because if we know that the particle goes through one of the slits it can't go through the other and so it can't interact with itself. This means that if we want to know which path the particle takes then we can't see the interference patter and vice versa, our measurement forces the particle to take a specific path through space.\nHowever there is something called Feynmans sum-over-histories which treats the photon as a particle. It says that the photon takes every possible path to the target (the white screen) therefore it can take both the paths thru the slits, and may other paths to, however this doesn't say that everything is fine and that light is particles. You can still say that the photon is a wave or that it takes every possible path, non of them are more right then the other and non of them brings everything back to normal since usually things can't travel two places at once.\n(Curiosa: The interference pattern should in fact look slightly different: the should be peaks and troughs already existing should also have peaks and troughs in them. This is because there are actually four wave sources. The incoming wave scatters from the sides of the slits so two slits with two sides makes for four wave sources. I painted each slit as an individual wave source for clarity. It only requires one slit to make the interference in pictured above)\nTHE WORLD OF PROBABILITIES\nTHE HIESENBERGS UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPAL\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principal is often in texts about Quantum Mechanics said to be that the more you know about a particles position the less you can know about its speed(although it's actually momentum, which is speed times mass but for the sake of simplicity I'll only use speed here). This isn't completely true since the uncertainty principal can be applied to many other situations. But what it basically says is that, in the world of particles(on subatomic levels), if you want to know more about one thing, you'll have to forfeit knowledge about another thing. But lets start with the example above:\nWe start of with a simplified billiard ball analogy; if you have a billiard ball and wants to know it's position you could shoot another billiard ball at it and watch it's trajectory. Its trajectory will depend on where it hit the other billiard ball(if it was a direct hit or if it just nudged it) and also the speed of the other billiard ball , so by watching its' trajectory you can find out the other billiard balls' position and speed.\nIf you have a particle and want to know its position you would shine some light on it to see were it is. If we considered light to be waves, then as normal waves do we could say that the light would shatter and form ripples around the particle. But now we want to know which way the photon went(just like in the double slit experiment) so then the light wave collapses into a photon and it can't spread out around the particle, it has to go one-way or another, so which way will it go? This is where the uncertainty comes in; there is no way of telling exactly which way the photon will go or exactly what speed it will have. There is just a set of chances that it will go one way or another. So therefore you can't get an exact answer of the particles' position or speed since there are allot of different scenarios where the photon would have some chance of gaining a similar speed and position as the one you may observe in an experiment. This is one thing that creates uncertainties when looking for a particles position.\nNow, the same thing goes for the particle that the photon will hit, since we now know that matter particles also behave as waves. So when the incoming photon collides with the particle it will give the particle a recoil which also will send it of in a random direction and at a random speed because of its' wave like character.\nIf you want to know the particles' position better you would use light with smaller wavelength, an increase in the wavelength is also an increase in the energy in the photon so this means that it will hit the particle harder. The thing is that if the photon hits the particle very lightly it will move away in a more uncertain way then if the photon would hit it very hard, in which case the particle would be set on the move in a much more predictable way and thereby you'll know it's direction and therefore it's destination better.\nYou can again think of normal billiard balls, if you only nudge the billiard ball the force in it's movement will be so small that any little disturbance in the rug will alter it's trajectory thereby making it hard to predict, but if you hit it hard it will take a large obstacle to stop or alter it's direction of motion. The same goes for particles, if the photon hits it very lightly it will be more easily affected by outside forces the if it were hit very hard.\nNow back to the photon and the particle; if you smack the photon harder into the particle you'll send it of flying which means that you've altered it's speed allot and in a uncertain fashion. However if you just nudge the particle its' speed will hardly change and so it will be more uncertain. BR> So then you can see that this is sort of a trade off between position and speed.\nBut you shouldn't think that it is only because we \"touch\" the particle that this behaviour occurs. Say we put a particle in a shrinking box, the more the box shrink the better we know the particles position(since then we've narrowed down the places were it can exist). But we don't interact with it so therefore we shouldn't change its momentum. Wrong. The smaller the box gets, the more energetic and unpredictable the particles motion gets. This is because, as in black body radiation, the particles wave length has to fit between the sides of the box. So as the box shrinks the wave length has to get smaller and smaller, and a smaller wave length leads to higher energy values, thereby the chaotic motion. So there's no way to get around it.\nTHE WAVE FUNCTION\nThe wave function is a mathematical device for dealing with probabilities. Lets say we haven't measured a particles spin(a particles spin has to do with the particles magnetic properties), its spin can be either up or down. Then we say that its wave function is 50% up and 50% down. You might say that it's completely wrong to say that the particles spin is 50% up and 50% down, clearly the particle already has a determined spin just that we don't know it yet. But this doesn't apply to quantum mechanics, a particle doesn't take on a special attribute until measured. Now we come into something called a superposition. A super position is two or more states which exists simultaneously in an object, e.g. a particle which hasn't got it's spin measured yet to see if it's down or up, is in a superposition of both down and up spin. The wavefunction also applys to a particles position, a particle doesn't have to have a certain position but instead it can have a certain probability of existing on different places(which we'll see later: smeared out electron). And this, again, doesn't mean that the particle really has a certain position but we just don't know about it, it doesn't have any position at all, just probabilities of existing on some locations. When we then measure the particle and get a exact result, we say that its wave function has collapsed, and we now have a certain result without the probabilities.\nIt wasn't very welcome(and still isn't?) in the scientific world that properties didn't exist until measured which meant that we couldn't predict exactly how things worked. And there's a famous experiment devised by Einstein, Poldosky, Rosen to prove that quantum mechanics(or more specific the Copenhagen interpretation which was the leading interpretation at that time) was wrong:\nTHE EPR PARADOX AND BELL'S THEOREM\nYou create two particles that have opposite spin (one have down the other one up) but you don't measure them to see which is which yet. Then you send them off in different directions. Then some were down the line, one of them hits a spin filter then we know its spin; lets say it's down. Then the other ones spin has to be up. This may not seem like a paradox. It's just like if you have two boxes and one has a blue cube in it and the other one a red cube. If you open one of them and find out that it's a blue cube you know the other one has to be red. But this logic can't be transferred to the quantum world, since in our world the red cube is always red and the blue always blue, but a particle spin is neither nor until you measure it. So it seems like when you measure one of the particles you immediately measure the other, and this is an immediate effect is faster then light, or that it's 'non-local', so it goes against relativity, which says that nothing can travel faster then light. Such pairs of particles are called 'entangeled' particles. So now quantum mechanics had to be wrong. Or had it?\nThis was resolved in Bell's theorem or also called Bells inequality. John Bell found that there should be certain differences between a theory, which is local and supposes that everything's predetermined and in and a theory, which is non-local and where things doesn't take on a special attribute until measured. Basicly in a world where every thing is determined you should be able to add together results from two experiments to make a prediction. But if that aren't the case (which is the case in quantum mechanics) then you can't add together results from different experiments since results aren't something constant, but has to be measured before they become something real to use. The verdict came in an experiment by Alain Aspect, and it was in the favour of the non-local. So the attributes of particles are uncertain and have to be measure to become real. But this doesn't mean that quantum mechanics is right, it simply means that our notion of one static world where every thing always exist is wrong, and that we need a new theory.\nQUANTUM TUNNELING\nIf you take a ball and throw it into the wall, it will of course bounce of the wall. But quantum mechanically a small piece of the balls wave function will \"spill\" a bit into the wall(the particles position is also uncertain and has a wave function), but it will not be able to pass through totally. This is because it ball has less energy then the wall.\nBut as said above you can't know an object properties too a 100%. This is also true for the energy level of balls, here it's time and accuracy which is traded for each other. If you want to know the balls energy level with a high accuracy you'll have to examine it under a long time. If you just examine it for a brief period of time the energy level will be less well defined. This means that the balls energy can fluctuate up and down, and that the shorter time span the higher the fluctuations.\nSo in fact there is a small but existing possibility that the ball will momentarily gain enough energy so that a large part of its wave function spills right through the wall and passes right through it. And here comes the strange part; the ball wont really travel through the wall. Instead it will hit the wall and reappear on the other side, faster then light. Note, that balls have little probability to tunnel through anything since all particles in the ball have to gain energy at the same time. But particles do sometimes, e.g in alpha radiation the protons and neutrons which will form the radiation particle tunnels through the nucleus currently in, in order to escape.\nSMEARED OUT ELECTRON\nIn the top of this page where I discuss the problems and solutions, I said that electrons move in circular orbits around the nucleus. This statement isn't entirely correct, see electron aren't as depicted in some elementary text books, little balls flying around the nucleus and there's a lot of empty space between them. In fact there aren't any empty space at all around the nucleus, the electrons occupy it all. This is because the electrons wave function is \"smeared\" out around the nucleus and the electron has a chance of existing a bit everywere, which also has to do with the uncertainty principal. Infact the electron doesn't just have a chance of being somewhere around the nucleus, it has a small but existing probability of being on Pluto or another galaxy even. So does that mean that we can forget the notion of an electron and also the notion of neat orbits around the nucleus? Not really, there are things called orbitals which are volumes of space around the nucleus were the electron has an about 90% chance of being found. Here are some pictures to show you what an orbital might look like:\nImagine the nucleus being in the centre of the shapes.\nNow you might wonder if a electron really can form a standing wave around sucha strange shape. The answer is that it doesn't have to adapt to the orbital, but infact it's the wave functions that arise from treating a electron as a standing wave which leads to the orbitals. But they aren't cicular as in the Bohr model, so then we can say bye bye to having nice division of the areas were the electron can be and not? Again not really, even though they aren't circular it's still largely a division of the areas were the electron can be, although it can as said above be anywhere. But since 90% of it's wave function(E.i it has a 90% chance) is within these orbitals it's still a division which keeps the electrons in place and the atoms functioning.\nAs seen above the orbital can take on different shapes, what shape the orbital has depends on the energy level of the electron or more specific on the three first quantum numbers.

However, the facility is underground and the GPS signals and other data streams had to be cabled down to the experiment, a latency the team are confident they took into account during their calculations.\nPhysicists from other organisations are now attempting to repeat the experiments to see if they get the same results. Whatever the outcome, this type of groundbreaking research is only possible thanks to the accuracy of atomic clocks that are able to measure time to millionths of a second.\nTo synchronise a computer network to an atomic clock you don\u2019t need to have access to a physics laboratory like CERN as simple NTP time servers like Galleons NTS 6001 will receive an accurate source of atomic clock time and keep all hardware on a network to within a few milliseconds of it.\nOddities of Time and the Importance of Accuracy\nWednesday, September 14th, 2011\nMost of us think we know what the time it is. At a glance of our wristwatches or wall clocks , we can tell what time it is. We also think we have a pretty good idea of the speed time move forwards, a second, a minute, an hour or a day are pretty well-defined; however, these units of time are completely man-made and are not as constant as we may think.\nTime is an abstract concept, while we may think it is the same for everybody, time is affected by its interaction with the universe. Gravity, for instance, as Einstein observed, has the ability to warp space-time altering the speed in which time passes, and while we all live on the same planet, under the same gravitational forces, there are subtle differences in the speed in which time passes.\nUsing atomic clocks, scientists are able to establish the effect Earth\u2019s gravity has on time. The high above sea level an atomic clock is placed, the quicker time travels. While these differences are minute, these experiments clearly demonstrate that Einstein\u2019s postulations were correct.\nAtomic clocks have been used to demonstrate some of Einstein\u2019s other theories regarding time too. In his theories of relativity, Einstein argued that speed is another factor that affects the speed at which time passes. By placing atomic clocks on orbiting spacecraft or aeroplanes travelling at speed, the time measured by these clocks differs to clocks left static on Earth, another indication that Einstein was right.\nBefore atomic clocks, measuring time to such degrees of accuracy was impossible, but since their invention in the 1950\u2019s, not only have Einstein\u2019s postulations proved right, but also we have discovered some other unusual aspects to how we regard time.\nWhile most of us think of a day as 24-hours, with every day being the same length, atomic clocks have shown that each day varies. Furthermore, atomic clocks have also shown that the Earth\u2019s rotation is gradually slowing down, meaning that days are getting slowly longer.\nBecause of these changes to time, the world\u2019s global timescale, UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) needs occasional adjustments. Every six months or so, leap seconds are added to ensure UTC runs at the same rate as an Earth day, accounting for the gradual slowing down of the planet\u2019s spin.\nFor technologies that require high levels of accuracy, these regular adjustments of time are accounted for by the time protocol NTP (Network Time Protocol) so a computer network using an NTP time server is always kept true to UTC .\nQuantum Atomic Clocks The precision of the future\nFriday, February 26th, 2010\nThe atomic clock is not a recent invention. Developed in the 1950\u2019s, the traditional caesium based atomic clock has been providing us with accurate time for half a century.\nThe caesium atomic clock has become the foundation of our time \u2013 literally. The International System of Units ( SI ) define a second as a certain number of oscillations of the atom caesium and atomic clocks govern many of the technologies that we live with an use on a daily basis: The internet, satellite navigation, air traffic control and traffic lights to name but a few.\nHowever, recent developments in optical quantum clocks that use single atoms of metals like aluminium or strontium are thousands of times more accurate than traditional atomic clocks. To put this in perspective, the best caesium atomic clock as used by institutes like NIST (National Institute for Standards and Time) or NPL (National Physical Laboratory) to govern the world\u2019s global timescale UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), is accurate to within a second every 100 million years. However, these new quantum optical clocks are accurate to a second every 3.4 billion years \u2013 almost as long as the earth is old.\nFor most people, their only encounter with an atomic clock is receiving its time signal is a network time server or NTP device (Network Time Protocol) for the purposes of synchronising devices and networks and these atomic clock signals are generated using caesium clocks.\nAnd until the world\u2019s scientists can agreed on a single atom to replace caesium and a single clock design for keeping UTC , none of us will be able to take advantage of this incredible accuracy.\nThe Way an Atomic Clock Works\nSaturday, October 24th, 2009\nAtomic clocks are the most accurate chronometers we have. They are millions of times more accurate than digital clocks and can keep time for hundreds of millions of years without losing as much as a second. Their use has revolutionised the way we live and work and they have enabled technologies such as satellite navigation systems and global online commerce.\nBut how do they work? Strangely enough, atomic clocks work in the same way as ordinary mechanical clocks. But rather than have a coiled spring and mass or pendulum they use the oscillations of atoms. Atomic clocks are not radioactive as they do not rely on atomic decay instead they rely on the tiny vibrations at certain energy levels (oscillations) between the nucleus of an atom and the surrounding electrons.\nWhen the atom receives microwave energy at exactly the right frequency, it changes energy state, this state is constant an unchanging and the oscillations can be measured just like the ticks of a mechanical clock. However, while mechanical clocks tick every second, atomic clocks \u2018tick\u2019 several billion times a second. In the case of caesium atoms, most commonly used in atomic clocks, they tick 9,192,631,770 per second \u2013 which is now the official definition of a second.\nAtomic clocks now govern the entire global community as a universal timescale UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) based on atomic clock time has been developed to ensure synchronization. UTC atomic clock signals can be received by network time servers, often referred to as NTP Servers , that can synchronize computer networks to within a few milliseconds of UTC .\nFacts of Time\nThursday, July 2nd, 2009\nFrom wristwatches to atomic clocks and NTP time servers , the understanding of time has become crucial for many modern technologies such as satellite navigation and global communications.\nFrom time dilation to the effects of gravity on time, time has many weird and wonderful facets that scientists are only beginning to understand and utilise. Here are some interesting, weird and unusual facts about time:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Time is not separate from space, time makes up what Einstein called four dimensional space time. Space time can be warped by gravity meaning that time slows down the greater the gravitational influence.\u00a0 Thanks to atomic clocks , time on earth can be measured at each subsequent inch above the earth\u2019s surface. That means that every bodies feet are younger than their head as time runs slower the lower to the ground you get.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Time is also affected by speed. The only constant in the universe is the speed of light (in a vacuum) which is always the same. Because of Einstein\u2019s famous theories of relativity anybody travelling at close to the speed of light a journey to an observer that would have taken thousands of years would have passed within seconds. This is called time dilation.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is nothing in contemporary physics that prohibits time travel both forward and backwards in time.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are 86400 seconds in a day, 600,000 in a week, more than 2.6 million in a month and more than 31 million in a year. If you live to be 70 years old then you will have lived through over 5.5 billion seconds.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A nanosecond is a billionth of a second or roughly the time it takes for light to travel about 1 foot (30 cm).\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A day is never 24 hours long. The earth\u2019s rotation is speeding up gradually which means the global timescale UTC (coordinated universal time) has to have leap seconds added once or twice a year. These leap seconds are automatically accounted for in any clock synchronization that uses NTP (Network Time Protocol) such as a dedicated NTP time server .\nGermans Enter Race to Build the Worlds Most Accurate Clock\nMonday, June 8th, 2009\nFollowing the success of Danish researchers working in conjunction with NIST (National Institute for Standards and Time), who unveiled the world\u2019s most accurate atomic clock earlier this year; German scientist have entered the race to build the world\u2019s most precise timepiece.\nResearchers at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt ( PTB ) in Germany are using use new methods of spectroscopy to investigate atomic and molecular systems and hope to develop a clock based around a single aluminium atom.\nMost atomic clocks used for satellite navigation ( GPS ), as references for computer network NTP servers and air traffic control have traditionally been based on the atom caesium. However, the next generation of atomic clocks, such as the one unveiled by NIST which is claimed to be accurate to within a second every 300 million years, uses the atoms from other materials such as strontium which scientists claim can be potentially more accurate than caesium.\nResearchers at PTB have opted to use single aluminium atoms and believe they are on the way to developing the most accurate clock ever and believe there is huge potential for such a device to help us understand some of the more complicated aspects of physics.\nThe current crop of atomic clocks allow technologies such as satellite navigation, air traffic control and network time synchronisation using NTP servers but it is believed the increases accuracy of the next generation of atomic clocks could be used to reveal some of the more enigmatic qualities of quantum science such as string theory.\nResearchers claim the new clocks will provide such accuracy they will even be able to measure the minute differences in gravity to within each centimetre above sea-level.\nThe Atom and Time keeping\nFriday, May 29th, 2009\nNuclear Weapons, computers, GPS , atomic clocks and carbon dating \u2013 there is much more to atoms than you think.\nSince the beginning of the twentieth century mankind has been obsessed with atoms and the minutiae of our universe. Much of the first part of the last century, mankind became obsessed with harnessing the hidden power of the atom, revealed to us by the work of Albert Einstein and finalised by Robert Oppenheimer.\nHowever, there has been much more to our exploration of the atom than just weapons. The studying of the atoms (quantum mechanics) has been at the root of most of our modern technologies such as computers and the Internet.\u00a0 It is also in the forefront of chronology \u2013 the measuring of time.\nThe atom plays a key role in both timekeeping and time prediction. The atomic clock, which is utilised all over the world by computer networks using NTP servers and other technical systems such as air traffic control and satellite navigation.\nAtomic clocks work by monitoring the extremely high frequency oscillations of individual atoms (traditionally caesium) that never changes at particular energy states. As caesium atoms resonate over a 9 billion times every second and never alters it its frequency it makes the m highly accurate (losing less than a second every 100 million years)\nBut atoms can also be used to work out not just accurate and precise time but they can also be utilised in establishing the age of objects. Carbon dating\u00a0 is the name given to this method which measures the natural decay of carbon atoms. All of us are made primarily of carbon and like other elements carbon \u2018decays\u2019 over time where the atoms lose energy by emitting ionizing particles and radiation.\nIn some atoms such as uranium this happens very quickly, however, other atoms such as iron are highly stable and decay very, very slowly. Carbon, while it decays quicker than iron is still slow to lose energy but the energy loss is exact over time so by analysing carbon atoms and measuring their strength it can be quite accurately ascertained when the carbon originally formed.\nBringing Atomic Clock Precision to your Desktop\nSaturday, May 16th, 2009\nAtomic clocks have been a huge influence on our modern lives with many of the technologies that have revolutionised the way we live our lives relying on their ultra precise time keeping abilities.\nAtomic clocks are far different to other chronometers; a normal watch or clock will keep time fairly accurately but will lose second or two each day. An atomic clock on the other hand will not lose a second in millions of years.\nIn fact it is fair to say that an atomic clock doesn\u2019t measure time but is the foundations we base our perceptions of time on. Let me explain, time, as Einstein demonstrated, is relative and the only constant in the universe is the speed of light (though a vacuum).\nMeasuring time with any real precision is therefore difficult as even the gravity on Earth skews time, slowing it down. It is also almost impossible to base time on any point of reference. Historically we have always used the revolution of the earth and reference to the celestial bodies as a basis for our time telling (24 hours in a day = one revolution of the Earth, 365 days = one revolution of the earth around the Sun etc).\nUnfortunately the Earth\u2019s rotation is not an accurate frame of reference to base our time keeping on. The earth slows down and speeds up in its revolution meaning some days are longer than others.\nAtomic clocks however, used the resonance of atoms (normally caesium) at particular energy states. As these atoms vibrate at exact frequencies (or an exact number of times) this can be used as a basis for telling time. So after the development of the atomic clock the second has been defined as over 9 billion resonance \u2019ticks\u2019 of the caesium atom.\nThe ultra precise nature of atomic clocks is the basis for technologies such as satellite navigation ( GPS ), air traffic control and internet trading. It is possible to use the precise nature of atomic clocks to synchronise computer networks too. All that is needed is a NTP time server (Network Time Protocol).\nNTP servers receive the time from atomic clocks via a broadcast signal or the GPS network they then distribute it amongst a network ensuring all devices have the exact same, ultra precise time.\nNext Generation of Accurate Atomic Clocks Starts Ticking as NIST scientists unveil new strontium clock\nSunday, April 26th, 2009\nThose chronological pioneers at NIST have teamed up with the University of Colorado and have developed the world\u2019s most accurate atomic clock to date. The strontium based clock is nearly twice as accurate as the current caesium clocks used to govern UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) as it loses just a second every 300 million years.\nStrontium based atomic clocks are now being seen as the way forward in timekeeping as higher levels of accuracy are attainable that are just not possible with the caesium atom. Strontium clocks, like their predecessors work by harnessing the natural yet highly consistent vibration of atoms.\nHowever, these new generations of clocks use laser beams and extremely low temperatures close to absolute zero to control the atoms and it is hoped it is a step forward to creating a perfectly precise clock.\nThis extreme accuracy may seem a step too far and unnecessary but the uses for such precision are many fold and when you consider the technologies that have been developed that are based on the first generation of atomic clocks such as GPS navigation, NTP server synchronisation and digital broadcasting a new world of exciting technology based on these new clocks could just be around the corner.\nWhile currently the world\u2019s global timescale, UTC , is based on the time told by a constellation of caesium clocks (and incidentally so is t he definition of a second as just over 9 billion caesium ticks), it is thought that when the Consultative Committee for Time and Frequency at the Bureau International DES Poids et Mesures ( BIPM ) next meets it will discuss whether to make these next generation of atomic clocks the new standard.\nHowever, strontium clocks are not the only method of highly precise time. Last year a quantum clock, also developed at NIST managed accuracy of 1 second in 1 billion years. However, this type of clock can\u2019t be directly monitored and requires a more complex scheme to monitor the time.\nThe Importance of the Atomic Clock\nFriday, March 20th, 2009\nMost people have vaguely heard of the atomic clock and presume they know what one is but very few people know just how important atomic clocks are for the running of our day to day lives in the twenty first century.\nThere are so many technologies that are reliant on atomic clocks and without many of the tasks we take for granted would be impossible. Air traffic control, satellite navigation and internet trading are just a few of the applications that are reliant on the ultra precise chronometry of an atomic clock.\nExactly what an atomic clock is, is often misunderstood. In simple terms an atomic clock is a device that uses the oscillations of atoms at different energy states to count ticks between seconds. Currently caesium is the preferred atom because it has over 9 billion ticks every second and because these oscillations never change it makes them a highly accurate method of keeping time.\nAtomic clocks despite what many people claim are only ever found in large scale physics laboratories such as NPL (UK National Physical Laboratory) and NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Time). Often people suggest they have an atomic clock that controls their computer network or that they have an atomic clock on their wall. This is not true and what people are referring to is that they have a clock or time server that receives the time from an atomic clock.\nDevices like the NTP time server often receive atomic clock signals form places such as NIST or NPL via long wave radio. Another method for receiving time from atomic clocks is using the GPS network (Global Positioning System).\nThe GPS network and satellite navigation are in fact a good example of why atomic clock synchonization is much needed with such high level of accuracy. Modern atomic clocks such as those found at NIST, NPL and inside orbiting GPS satellites are accurate to within a second every 100 million years or so. This accuracy is crucial when you examine how something like a cars GPS satellite navigation system works.\nA GPS system works by triangulating the time signals sent from three or more separate GPS satellites and their onboard atomic clocks. Because these signals travel at the speed of light (nearly 100,000km a second) an inaccuracy of even one whole millisecond could put the navigational information out by 100 kilometres.\nThis high level of accuracy is also required for technologies such as air traffic control ensuring our crowded skies remain safe and is even critical for many Internet transactions such as trading in derivatives where the value can rise and fall every second.\n"}, {"score": 2543.6638, "uuid": "e5557e3f-db55-5ee6-aa9f-2720fd0df446", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1606wb-71-20027", "target_hostname": "lesswrong.com", "target_uri": "http://lesswrong.com/lw/r9/quantum_mechanics_and_personal_identity/", "page_rank": 1.2062069e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em> <em>and</em> Personal Identity - Less Wrong", "snippet": "Then why care about <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em> at all?

The universe just doesn't work in a way which would let us make that interpretation.\nThere are more abstract and philosophical arguments that you could use to rule out atom-following theories of personal identity.\u00a0 But it so happens that we live in a universe where the issue is flatly settled by standard physics.\u00a0 It's like proposing that personal identity follows phlogiston.\u00a0 You could argue against it on philosophical grounds - but we happen to live in a universe where \"phlogiston\" itself is just a mistaken theory to be discarded, which settles the issue much more abruptly.\nAnd no, this does not rely on a woo-woo mysterian interpretation of quantum mechanics.\u00a0 The other purpose of this series of posts, was to demystify quantum mechanics and reveal it as non-mysterious.\u00a0 It just happens to be a fact that once you get to the non-mysterious version of quantum mechanics, you find that the reason why physics once looked mysterious, has to do with reality being made up of different stuff than little billiard balls.\u00a0 Complex amplitudes in configuration spaces, to be exact, though here I jump ahead of myself.\nIf you read all the way to the end, you will, I hope, gain an entirely new perspective on where your \"identity\" is located... once the little billiard balls are ruled out.\nYou will even be able to see, I hope, that if your brain were non-destructively frozen (e.g. by vitrification in liquid nitrogen); and a computer model of the synapses, neural states, and other brain behaviors were constructed a hundred years later; then it would preserve exactly everything about you that was preserved by going to sleep one night and waking up the next morning.\nMind you, my audacious claim is not that uploading preserves identity - this audacious claim has been made many times before.\u00a0 I am claiming that once you grasp modern physics, you can actually see this as obvious, even if it would not be obvious to someone thinking in terms of Newtonian billiard balls in classical physics.\u00a0 This is much more audacious, and I am well aware of how unlikely that sounds; but I believe that I have fully supported that claim... if you read all the way to the end.\nReductionism :\u00a0 We build models of the universe that have many different levels of description.\u00a0 But so far as anyone has been able to determine, the universe itself has only the single level of fundamental physics - reality doesn't explicitly compute protons, only quarks.\nZombies!

Individual configurations don't have physics; amplitude distributions have physics.\u00a0 Quantum entanglement is the general case; quantum independence is the special case.\nFeynman Paths : Instead of thinking that a photon takes a single straight path through space, we can regard it as taking all possible paths through space, and adding the amplitudes for every possible path.\u00a0 Nearly all the paths cancel out - unless we do clever quantum things, so that some paths add instead of canceling out.\u00a0 Then we can make light do funny tricks for us, like reflecting off a mirror in such a way that the angle of incidence doesn't equal the angle of reflection.\u00a0 But ordinarily, nearly all the paths except an extremely narrow band, cancel out - this is one of the keys to recovering the hallucination of classical physics.\nNo Individual Particles : One of the chief ways to confuse yourself while thinking about quantum mechanics, is to think as if photons were little billiard balls bouncing around.\u00a0 The appearance of little billiard balls is a special case of a deeper level on which there are only multiparticle configurations and amplitude flows.\u00a0 It is easy to set up physical situations in which there exists no fact of the matter as to which electron was originally which.\nIdentity Isn't In Specific Atoms , Three Dialogues on Identity : Given that there's no such thing as \"the same atom\", whether you are \"the same person\" from one time to another can't possibly depend on whether you're made out of the same atoms.\nDecoherence : A quantum system that factorizes can evolve into a system that doesn't factorize, destroying the illusion of independence.\u00a0 But entangling a quantum system with its environment, can appear to destroy entanglements that are already present.\u00a0 Entanglement with the environment can separate out the pieces of an amplitude distribution, preventing them from interacting with each other.\u00a0 Decoherence is fundamentally symmetric in time, but appears asymmetric because of the second law of thermodynamics.\nThe So-Called Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle : Unlike classical physics, in quantum physics it is not possible to separate out a particle's \"position\" from its \"momentum\".\u00a0 The evolution of the amplitude distribution over time, involves things like taking the second derivative in space and multiplying by i to get the first derivative in time.\u00a0 The end result of this time evolution rule is that blobs of particle-presence appear to race around in physical space.\u00a0 The notion of \"an exact particular momentum\" or \"an exact particular position\" is not something that can physically happen, it is a tool for analyzing amplitude distributions by taking them apart into a sum of simpler waves.\u00a0 This uses the assumption and fact of linearity: the evolution of the whole wavefunction seems to always be the additive sum of the evolution of its pieces.\u00a0 Using this tool, we can see that if you take apart the same distribution into a sum of positions and a sum of momenta, they cannot both be sharply concentrated at the same time.\u00a0 When you \"observe\" a particle's position, that is, decohere its positional distribution by making it interact with a sensor, you take its wave packet apart into two pieces; then the two pieces evolve differently.\u00a0 The Heisenberg Principle definitely does not say that knowing about the particle, or consciously seeing it, will make the universe behave differently.\nWhere Physics Meets Experience : Meet the Ebborians, who reproduce by fission.\u00a0 The Ebborian brain is like a thick sheet of paper that splits down its thickness.\u00a0 They frequently experience dividing into two minds, and can talk to their other selves.\u00a0 It seems that their unified theory of physics is almost finished, and can answer every question, when one Ebborian asks:\u00a0 When exactly does one Ebborian become two people?\nWhere Experience Confuses Physicists : It then turns out that the entire planet of Ebbore is splitting along a fourth-dimensional thickness, duplicating all the people within it. But why does the apparent chance of \"ending up\" in one of those worlds, equal the square of the fourth-dimensional thickness?\u00a0 Many mysterious answers are proposed to this question, and one non-mysterious one.\nOn Being Decoherent : When a sensor measures a particle whose amplitude distribution stretches over space - perhaps seeing if the particle is to the left or right of some dividing line - then the standard laws of quantum mechanics call for the sensor+particle system to evolve into a state of (particle left, sensor measures LEFT) + (particle right, sensor measures RIGHT).\u00a0 But when we humans look at the sensor, it only seems to say \"LEFT\" or \"RIGHT\", never a mixture like \"LIGFT\".\u00a0 This, of course, is because we ourselves are made of particles, and subject to the standard quantum laws that imply decoherence.\u00a0 Under standard quantum laws, the final state is (particle left, sensor measures LEFT, human sees \"LEFT\") + (particle right, sensor measures RIGHT, human sees \"RIGHT\").\nThe Conscious Sorites Paradox : Decoherence is implicit in quantum physics, not an extra law on top of it.\u00a0 Asking exactly when \"one world\" splits into \"two worlds\" may be like asking when, if you keep removing grains of sand from a pile, it stops being a \"heap\".\u00a0 Even if you're inside the world, there may not be a definite answer.\u00a0 This puzzle does not arise only in quantum physics; the Ebborians could face it in a classical universe, or we could build sentient flat computers that split down their thickness. Is this really a physicist's problem?\nDecoherent Essences : Decoherence is implicit within physics, not an extra law on top of it. You can choose representations that make decoherence harder to see, just like you can choose representations that make apples harder to see, but exactly the same physical process still goes on; the apple doesn't disappear and neither does decoherence.\u00a0 If you could make decoherence magically go away by choosing the right representation, we wouldn't need to shield quantum computers from the environment.\nThe Born Probabilities :\u00a0 The last serious mysterious question left in quantum physics:\u00a0 When a quantum world splits in two, why do we seem to have a greater probability of ending up in the larger blob, exactly proportional to the integral of the squared modulus? It's an open problem, but non-mysterious answers have been proposed. Try not to go funny in the head about it.\nLarge number of posts skipped here, see the main sequence for them.\nMach's Principle: Anti-Epiphenomenal Physics : Could you tell if the whole universe were shifted an inch to the left? Could you tell if the whole universe was traveling left at ten miles per hour?\u00a0 Could you tell if the whole universe was accelerating left at ten miles per hour?\u00a0 Could you tell if the whole universe was rotating?\nRelative Configuration Space : Maybe the reason why we can't observe absolute speeds, absolute positions, absolute accelerations, or absolute rotations, is that particles don't have absolute positions - only positions relative to each other.\u00a0 That is, maybe quantum physics takes place in a relative configuration space.\nTimeless Physics : What time is it?\u00a0 How do you know?\u00a0 The question \"What time is it right now?\" may make around as much sense as asking \"Where is the universe?\" Not only that, our physics equations may not need a t in them!\nTimeless Beauty : To get rid of time you must reduce it to nontime.\u00a0 In timeless physics, everything that exists is perfectly global or perfectly local.\u00a0 The laws of physics are perfectly global; the configuration space is perfectly local.\u00a0 Every fundamentally existent ontological entity has a unique identity and a unique value.\u00a0 This beauty makes ugly theories much more visibly ugly; a collapse postulate becomes a visible scar on the perfection.\nTimeless Causality : Using the modern, Bayesian formulation of causality, we can define causality without talking about time - define it purely in terms of relations.\u00a0 The river of time never flows, but it has a direction.\nTimeless Identity : How can you be the same person tomorrow as today, in the river that never flows, when not a drop of water is shared between one time and another?\u00a0 Having used physics to completely trash all naive theories of identity, we reassemble a conception of persons and experiences from what is left.\u00a0 This is the point at which you become able to see that uploading a person preserves everything of importance about them.\nThou Art Physics :\u00a0 If the laws of physics control everything we do, then how can our choices be meaningful?\u00a0 Because you are physics.\u00a0 You aren't competing with physics for control of the universe, you are within physics.\u00a0 Anything you control is necessarily controlled by physics.\nTimeless Control : We throw away \"time\" but retain causality, and with it, the concepts \"control\" and \"decide\".\u00a0 To talk of something as having been \"always determined\" is mixing up a timeless and a timeful conclusion, with paradoxical results.\u00a0 When you take a perspective outside time, you have to be careful not to let your old, timeful intuitions run wild in the absence of their subject matter.\nLiving in Many Worlds : The many worlds of quantum mechanics are not some strange, alien universe into which you have been thrust.\u00a0 They are where you have always lived.\u00a0 Egan's Law:\u00a0 \"It all adds up to normality.\"\u00a0 Then why care about quantum physics at all?\u00a0 Because there's still the question of what adds up to normality, and the answer to this question turns out to be, \"Quantum physics.\"\u00a0 If you're thinking of building any strange philosophies around many-worlds, you probably shouldn't - that's not what it's for.\n"}, {"score": 2540.0854, "uuid": "20d07b0c-77d9-5bc3-9efb-5abc00d5b9c9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0611wb-19-03962", "target_hostname": "philosophytalk.org", "target_uri": "http://philosophytalk.org/shows/time-space-and-quantum-mechanics", "page_rank": 1.2523809e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Time, Space, <em>and</em> <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em> | Philosophy Talk", "snippet": "For example, <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em> delivers no very clear message about <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> past, present <em>and</em> future. <em>What</em> are <em>the</em> implications for our everyday experience of space <em>and</em> time?", "explanation": null, "document": "Time, Space, and Quantum Mechanics\nWeek of:\n"}, {"score": 2539.0, "uuid": "1c950571-cc99-57f5-a025-a110b3bd4331", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1208wb-68-30666", "target_hostname": "web.fccj.org", "target_uri": "http://web.fccj.org/~ethall/quantum/quant.htm", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Thall&#x27;s History of <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>", "snippet": "Had Hamilton, often considered <em>the</em> &quot;forgotten founder&quot;

It specifies total energy (kinetic & potential) in terms of dynamics, position, and momentum of particles. Hamiltonians are a method for finding the minimum value of a given equation and are used to calculate the path of least action such as orbits and trajectories. Hamilton's unification of dynamics and optics has had a\u00a0 lasting influence on mathematical physics, even though the full significance of his work was not fully appreciated until after the rise of quantum mechanics.\nDavid Hilbert (1862-1943)\nHilbert Space\nDavid Hilbert was one of the outstanding mathematicians of the modern era. He proposed 21 geometry axioms--the greatest influence in geometry since Euclid (325 BC).\u00a0 Hilbert's work on infinite-dimensional space, later called Hilbert space, proved invaluable for quantum mechanics. Today quantum mechanics is said to be a theory set in \"Hilbert Space.\"\u00a0 At the InternationalCongress of Mathematicians in Paris (1900) Hilbert presented the now famous 23 problems which he challenged 20th century mathematicians to solve. In 1915 Hilbert discovered the correct field equations for general relativity before Einstein but never claimed priority.\nAs professor of mathematics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, outstanding scientists of the 20th century (Born, Heisenberg, Jordon, von Neumann to name just a few) studied with Hilbert. Hilbert suggested to Heisenberg that he find the differential equation that would correspond to his matrix equations. Had he taken Hilbert's advice, Heisenberg may have discovered the Schr\u00f6dinger equation before Schr\u00f6dinger. When mathematicians proved Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Schr\u00f6dinger' swave mechanics equivalent, Hilbert exclaimed, \"Physics is obviously far too difficult to be left to the physicists and mathematicians still think they are God's gift to science.\"\nMax Planck (1858-1947)\nQuantum Theory\nMost theoretical physicists usually do their most important work by the age of 25 (Newton, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Dirac, de Broglie, Pauli).\u00a0 This seems to be the ideal age since there is time to learn enough while maintaining revolutionary ideas. What is remarkable about Planck is that at age 42, he explained the puzzle of \" black body radiation. \" Any object with a higher temperature than its surroundings loses heat by radiation. The hotter the object, the more radiation it produces. Since a black body absorbs all frequencies, it should radiate all frequencies equally.\u00a0 Instead, black bodies emit larger quantities of some wavelengths than others. In 1900 Planck proposed that radiant heat energy is emitted only in definite amount called quanta .\nE = hn\u00a0\u00a0 n = frequency of light h = 6.626x10-34 Js\nPlanck maintained that only certain energies could appear and were limited to whole-number multiples of hn.\u00a0 Planck originally called h \"quantum of action\" since the product of energy and time is known as action (based on Hamilton's principle of least action).\u00a0 Today h is known as Planck's constant and symbolizes the revolutionary new physics.\nA young Max Planck was to give a lecture on radiant heat.\u00a0 When he arrived he inquired as to the room number for the Planck lecture.\u00a0 He was told, \"You are much too young to be attending the lecture of the esteemed professor Planck.\"\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955)\nPhotoelectric Effect\n1905 was a good year for Einstein.\u00a0 He managed to solve three of the outstanding problems of physics: the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, and special theory of relativity.\u00a0 These three publications have become known as the \"Einstein trilogy.\"\nPrior to 1905 researchers noted that current was proportional to the intensity of light striking the surface of a metal. The maximum kinetic energy of electron does not depend on intensity but rather on the frequency of the light. Einstein realized Planck's idea of light appearing as quanta (bundles) was the key to understanding this photoelectric mystery.\u00a0 If the wavelength is short enough, the electron cannot escape. The important thing is the energy of the bundle and not number of bundles (brightness). The photoelectric effect is recognized as the first scientific work utilizing quantum mechanics.\nEinstein could never accept some of the revolutionary ideas of quantum mechanics (\"God does not play dice\").\u00a0 When reminded in 1927 that he revolutionized science 20 years earlier, Einstein replied, \"A good joke should not be repeated too often.\"\nNiels Bohr (1885-1962)\nBohr Theory of Atom\nBohr (1913) was the first to apply the quantum theory to atomic structure. The most impressive result of the so-called Bohr theory was the way it accounted for the series of lines observed in the spectrum of light emitted by atomic hydrogen. Bohr was able to determine the frequencies of these spectral lines to considerable accuracy by expressing them in terms of the charge and mass of the electron and Planck's constant. To do this, Bohr also postulated that an atom would not emit radiation while it was in one of its stable states but rather only when it made a transition between states. The frequency of the emitted radiation would be equal to the difference in energy between those states divided by Planck's constant. This meant that the atom could neither absorb nor emit radiation continuously but only in finite steps or quantum jumps. It also meant that the various frequencies of the radiation emitted by an atom were not equal to the frequencies with which the electrons moved within the atom.\u00a0 This was a bold idea that some of Bohr's contemporaries found difficult to accept.\nIn 1916 Bohr was appointed professor to the newly created chair of theoretical physics at the University of Copenhagen and in 1921 the Bohr Institute opened with Bohr as its director. The Bohr Institute became a leading center for quantum physics with young theoretical physicists from all over the world (Pauli, Heisenberg, Dirac, Oppenheimer, and Gamow to name just a few) coming to Copenhagen to work with Bohr.\nThe young physicists would sit at sidewalk cafe discussing the latest quantum theories while applying amusing scientific methods such as describing the women of Copenhagen as they passed by:\nWerner Heisenberg (1901-1976)\nQuantum Mechanics\nMaking use of matrix algebra, Heisenberg (1925) developed a system called matrix mechanics. It consisted of an array of quantities which when appropriately manipulated gave the observed frequencies and intensities of spectral lines.\u00a0 The consequence of Heisenberg's work is his revolutionary (1927) uncertainty principle: DqDp > h\nThe uncertainty of position (Dq) of an electron in an atom multiplied by the uncertainty of its momentum (Dp) must be greater than Planck's constant (h).\u00a0 The uncertainty principle tells us that all observable quantities are subject to changes determined by Planck's constant and we cannot know position and momentum simultaneously. While a photon will not disturb an object like a house, it does alter position and momentum when bounced off an electron.\nHeisenberg is out for a drive when he's stopped by a traffic cop. The cop says, \"Do you know how fast you were going?\"\nHeisenberg says, \"No, but I know where I am.\"\nLouis de Broglie (1892-1987)\nWave Nature of Electron\nAs an undergraduate de Broglie studied medieval history. During World War I he served in a field radio communication unit and this changed his interest from Gothic cathedrals to electromagnetic waves.\u00a0 After the war de Broglie did his doctoral thesis in what has become known as \"de Broglie waves.\" In 1924 de Broglie speculated that nature did not single out light as the only entity to exhibit wave-particle duality. He proposed that ordinary particles such as electrons could also exhibit wave characteristics in certain circumstances. de Broglie assumed that an electron has associated with it a system of \"matter waves.\"\u00a0 These waves possess crests that disappear at one point and appear an instant later at another point.\u00a0 The distance between successive crests (l) is the de Broglie wavelength and it is calculated from l = h/mv, where h is Planck's constant and mv is momentum.\nThe following is taken from Thirty Years that Shook Physics by George Gamow:\nAt our first meeting we started talking physics although de Broglie did not speak any English and my French was rather poor.\u00a0 But somehow I managed to convey to him what I wanted to say and to understand his comments. A year later I was in the audience in London when de Broglie delivered a brilliant lecture in perfect English.\u00a0 Then I understood another of his principles: When foreigners come to France, they must speak French.\nErwin Schr\u00f6dinger (1887-1961)\nWave Equation\nAdopting the proposal by de Broglie that particles of matter have dual nature and in some situations act like waves, Schr\u00f6dinger (1926) produced the basic equation of quantum mechanics. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation treats electrons as matter waves:\nThe only problem with Schr\u00f6dinger's equation was his interpretation of the matter wave was wrong. He described y as the density distribution--some regions rich in electron matter while others scarce. But it was Max Born who figured out what the equation actually predicts.\nIn 1944 Schr\u00f6dinger wrote a short book entitled \"What is Life?\" Schr\u00f6dinger suggests that one of life's essential features is the storage of a genetic code passed from parent to offspring. Because it had to fit in a single cell, Schr\u00f6dinger suggests the code is written at the molecular level. Schr\u00f6dinger's book had a pronounced influence on Crick & Watson, discoverers of DNA.\nThe following is taken from The God Particle by Leon Lederman:\nLeaving his wife at home, Schr\u00f6dinger booked a villa in the Swiss Alps for two weeks, taking with him his notebooks, two pearls, and an old Viennese girlfriend. Schr\u00f6dinger's self-appointed mission was to save the patched-up, creaky quantum theory of the time. The Viennese-born physicist placed a pearl in each ear to screen out any distracting noises.\u00a0 Then he placed the girlfriend in bed for inspiration. Schr\u00f6dinger had his work cut out for him.\u00a0 He had to create a new theory and keep the lady happy.\u00a0 Fortunately, he was up to the task.\nMax Born (1882-1970)\nProbability Density\nIn 1926, after his student Werner Heisenberg had formulated the first laws of quantum mechanics, Born collaborated with him to develop the mathematical formulation that would adequately describe it. When Schr\u00f6dinger put forward his quantum mechanical wave equation, Born showed that the solution of the equation has a statistical meaning of physical significance. Born's interpretation of the wave equation proved to be of fundamental importance in the new theory of quantum mechanics. Schr\u00f6dinger believed that the electron was spread out in space and its density given by the value of y2. Almost immediately Born proposed what is now the accepted interpretation: y2 gives the probability density of finding the electron. The distinction between the two interpretations is important.\u00a0 If y2 is small at a particular position, the original interpretation implies that a small fraction of an electron will always be detected there. In Born's interpretation, nothing will be detected there most of the time, but when something is observed, it will be a whole electron. The concept of the electron as a point particle moving in a well-defined path around the nucleus is replaced in wave mechanics by clouds that describe the probable locations of electrons in different states. Born's probability density is perhaps the most dramatic change in viewing our world since Newton and gravity.\nOther notable contributions by Born include Born-Haber cycle and Olivia Newton-John\nThe following is taken from Men Who Made a New Physics by Barbara Cline:\nBorn has been described as a moody and impulsive person. He would tell his student, \"You must not mind my being rude. I have a resistance against accepting something new.\u00a0 I get angry and swear but always accept after a time if it is right.\"\nWolfgang Pauli (1900-1958)\nExclusion Principle\nPauli proposed a new quantum theory property (1925) called \"two-valuedness.\" Goudsmit and Uhlenberg identified this fourth quantum number as electron spin.\u00a0 The exclusion principle is now stated as, \"No two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers.\"\nThe exclusion principle subsequently has been modified to include a whole class of particles of which the electron is only one member. Subatomic particles fall into two classes: particles obeying the Pauli exclusion principle are fermions and all others are bosons. When in a closed system, such as an atom for electrons or a nucleus for protons and neutrons, fermions are distributed so that a given state is occupied by only one at a time.\nUndergraduate Pauli moderated an Einstein lecture. After Einstein's response to a question Pauli summarized with, \"What Einstein says is not so stupid!\"\nWhen distinguished physicist Paul Ehrenfest told Pauli that he liked Pauli's publications better than he liked Pauli, Pauli replied, \"That's odd, I feel the exact opposite about you!\"\nPaul Dirac (1902-1984)\nQuantum Electrodynamics\nDirac laid the foundations for quantum electrodynamics (1927) with his discovery of an equation\u00a0 incorporating both the quantum theory and the theory of special relativity.\u00a0 Dirac showed that the correct relationship between mass and energy was not Einstein's equation (E = mc2) but actually E2 = m2c4. When solving Dirac's equation, E =mc2 as well as E = -mc2\nBut how can energy of an electron be negative?\nDirac predicted the existence of electrons with positive charge (antielectron or positron).\u00a0 In 1932 Carl Anderson detected positrons.\u00a0 Dirac also predicted every particle possesses an antiparticle (antiproton, antineutron, etc.).\nLocal Interest:\u00a0 Dirac was professor of physics at Florida State University from 1971-1984.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Dirac Science Library is named after him.\nDuring a question and answer period after a lecture Dirac gave at the University of Toronto, an audience member raised his hand and said, \"Professor Dirac, I do not understand how you derived the formula on the top left side of the blackboard.\"\n\"That is not a question,\" snapped Dirac, \"it is a statement.\u00a0 Next question, please.\"\nJohn von Neumann (1903-1957)\nOperator Theory\nEarly quantum theory had two approaches: Matrix mechanics proposed by Heisenberg and wave mechanics developed by Schr\u00f6dinger.\u00a0 Heisenberg found the physical ideas of Schr\u00f6dinger's theory \"disgusting,\" and Schr\u00f6dinger was \"discouraged and repelled\"\u00a0 by lack of visualization in Heisenberg's method.\nvon Neumann was considered the brightest young mathematician in Europe.\u00a0 After hearing Heisenberg lecture on matrix mechanics, von Neumann decided to develop his own version of quantum mechanics--the matrices of Heisenberg were \"too imprecise.\"\u00a0 In his book (1932), The mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, von Neumann invented operator theory (now called Neumann algebras) to explain certain aspects of quantum mechanics.\u00a0 Largely because of his work, quantum physics and operator theory can be viewed as two aspects of the same subject. von Neumann's new mathematics proved Schr\u00f6dinger and Heisenberg theories equivalent mathematically. Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanics eventually became the method of choice because it is less abstract and easier to understand than Heisenberg's matrix mechanics.\nIn 1933 von Neumann solved Hilbert's fifth problem, the case of compact groups. Although he never won Nobel Prize or gained world-wide fame, von Neumann was one of the truly outstanding mathematician/scientists of the 20th century.\n1927 Solvay Conference\nHeld in Belgium, the conference was attended by the world's most notable physicists to discuss the newly formulated quantum theory. Of the 12 individuals cited here in History of Quantum Mechanics, only the three mathematicians were not in attendance: William Hamilton was dead, John von Neumann did not publish his book until 1932, and David Hilbert (\"physics far too difficult for physicists\") probably wasn't invited.\n"}, {"score": 2530.1045, "uuid": "1318afb0-3aa4-5605-8e9c-a68712893f81", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0203wb-85-22938", "target_hostname": "www.ldolphin.org", "target_uri": "http://www.ldolphin.org/qm1.html", "page_rank": 1.188802e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>, Beyond all Reason", "snippet": "Miracles of God&#x27;s providence may find their course in natural circumstance <em>and</em> <em>the</em> line <em>between</em> <em>the</em> natural <em>and</em> <em>the</em> supernatural may not always be fully clear, but <em>what</em> <em>is</em> certain with regard to <em>the</em> God of history <em>is</em> that there <em>is</em> indeed a distinct <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> <em>the</em> two.", "explanation": null, "document": "Quantum Mechanics, Beyond all Reason\nby Paul Ashley *\n\"God doesn't play dice\" were the words voiced by Albert Einstein in his long running debate with Danish physicist Niels Bohr during the late 1920's.

Later Werner Heisenberg would formulate his famous uncertainty principle describing the relationship between inherently unknowable physical quantities. Einstein was disturbed because he could not reconcile such apparent \"chances\" in the nature of the universe. Most other scientists accepted the new theory and welcomed the discoveries of modern physics including the nature of atomic spectra, energy distribution, and particle interaction. Such knowledge eventually led to the development of such technological wonders as transistors and lasers. But Einstein resisted. Was it really because he believed that this inference of quantum mechanics threatened the nature of God? Perhaps R C Sproul in his book Not a Chance admirably refutes chance as a viable attribute of the universe. He writes, \"The mere existence of chance is enough to rip God from his cosmic throne\" (1). As he points out, some scientists, apparently including Bohr, would come to embrace chance as a viable explanation. Still others would go further to even welcome the implications as supportive evidence for a Godless cosmos. Nevertheless, was as some contend, Einstein's opposing alternative to chance intended as supportive of the God of the Bible? Einstein could not believe that God would have created a universe in which if man were smart enough, he could not figure it out. He once wrote, \"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the harmony of all that exists, but not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and action of men\" (2.) Einstein's concept of the world was one which was apparently totally deterministic and followed natural laws which with enough knowledge and reasoning man should be expected to decipher. So strong was that belief that he went against his own admitted better judgment to introduce a \"fudge factor\" called the cosmological constant to his celebrated general theory of relativity (included gravitational effects) in order to preserve the concept of an infinite universe, a universe in steady state. One would reckon then that the alternative to chance is a universe totally determined and free running, governed strictly by laws of nature, hardly needing God, aside from creation. And if argument prevails God may not be needed at all. Both alternatives have indeed been used to espouse a belief in a natural cosmos, one without God. Random chance and strict naturalism... Two extremes which often lead to the same conclusion.\nIs there \"per chance\" an alternative? One which those like Einstein may not have considered a suitable refuge. A cosmos not randomly ruled, though not wholly understandable by human reasoning or definable by laws of nature, at least not of mortal comprehension. I'm speaking of a world in which God plays an active and a personal role. A world in which a violation of the laws of nature does not undermine one's confidence in reality nor does it otherwise make impotent scientific investigation.\nThe laws of nature are established principles constructed of prescribed formalism based upon rules of logic, which are in turn established by reason. The formalism is conceived of the human mind, the logic is borne of human intellect, and the reason is bound by human understanding. For the wisest of men was left to say, \"That which is far off, and exceedingly deep, who can find it out?\" (Ecc. 7:24) and the Apostle later concluded, \"Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and His ways past finding out!\" (Rom. 11:33) Therefore, we can safely apply humanly derived laws of nature only to that which is subject to the laws of nature. If the Bible is to be believed, the vast majority of the cosmos is not likely in this category. That doesn't make the world any less real or unreasonable, only beyond reasoning, human reasoning that is. I can't understand the power of angels nor do I ever expect to, but that doesn't make them any less real. I often speak to non-Christians who possess a scientific background about the things of God and the first point to get across in order to establish a common ground for discussion is their realm of reality. Where is your bound of reality? What do you place inside of it? Does it include only that which is currently understood? Does it include that which you don't understand or believe to be understandable by laws of nature? Further, does it also include that which is not explainable by humanly derived reasoning? Everyone draws the line bounding reality along some defining course. Where that line is drawn makes all the difference in the construction of a concept for the cosmos. Draw the line too broad and random chance makes reality evasive and God irrelevant. Draw the line too narrow and strict determinism makes reality subject to natural limitations and makes a personal God unnecessary.\nIt is easy to lose a proper balance at this point. Herein lies the danger of both extremes. As Sproul points out chance relegates causality to a relatively minor role. However, causality, if limited to the natural, oversteps the bounds of God's transcendent control of the universe. Such natural causality forms the opposite pole of atheistic argument. Evidence of this may be seen by noticing that Sproul was able to enlist many quotes from secular atheistic philosophers and scientists in support of his case against chance. Voltaire, Hume, Descartes, and Sagan all believed in a strict naturalism. If this seems a bit unsettling, notice further that one might equally imagine an atheistic apologist quoting from Not a Chance (out of context, of course) in support of naturalism. One of the few sticking points would be the question of first cause. And if one accepts the logical premise which Sproul develops that the first cause must be self existent and if it is further assumed that no other attribute is required, then the first cause could just as well be a blob of matter and/or energy just before the Big Bang. After all, naturalism does not require intelligent design and neither does a self existent first cause if causality follows blindly.\nYou see it is when other attributes are associated with first cause that the naturalist often objects; when the name God is applied, intelligence and personality are generally implied. But a pantheistic God without these additional attributes would be no problem. The Christian theologian would of course object to such a restricted definition of God, as he should, but he should likewise also object to totally natural causality, for it leads to the same end. It should then not be surprising that many of the arguments of naturalists may be excerpted as strong statements for determinism and against chance.\nUltimate insight into the nature of the cosmos is not to be found in chance nor in natural causality alone. The Bible speaks not just of the natural but of the \"super\" natural as well. Nowhere is it implied that if man were smart enough he could figure it out. It is not simply a lack of knowledge, although that may often times be the case, but it is a matter of reasoning, \"past finding out\". The supernatural is beyond the natural laws as man and science define them. When Jesus healed the lame, or restored sight to the blind, natural laws were violated. Natural causality no longer has meaning. Miracles of God's providence may find their course in natural circumstance and the line between the natural and the supernatural may not always be fully clear, but what is certain with regard to the God of history is that there is indeed a distinct difference between the two. And it is at that line that natural causality ends and supernatural causality begins. As long as the existence of that line is understood there is no conflict with the realm of science. It should not be threatened. Quite the contrary. A realization of that which is beyond the legal jurisdiction of natural laws, if not also the understanding of human reason, is perhaps the greatest advantage of insight and lucidity for the scientist who is also a Christian.\nIt is here that the road of scientific thought truly diverges. The stepping stones of chance and strict determinism or natural causality have both served for paving the path toward naturalism. It is a God both transcendent and personal, the epitome of first cause, that created both the supernatural as well as the natural. And the road to true cosmology is paved with sure and solid stones, both natural and supernatural.\nWhere does such a concept of the universe leave science and scientific investigation? Science is clearly defined by rules of logic generally expressed in mathematical terms. Such formalism is used to describe laws of nature as they are observed and understood through human reason. These laws to the extent to which they are correctly understood are dependable and predictable. They follow rules for natural causality or as commonly referred to, cause and effect. Within the bounds of the natural, scientific investigation may find gainful service. But there is another realm of the universe which the Bible describes that is beyond the natural. Within this realm both science and the foundations of human reasoning may not be expected to appropriately apply.\nRecognizing this grander picture of the universe can make scientific investigation much more insightful. But first one must possess a means of advancement to new knowledge or understanding. In scientific investigation experimental methodology coupled with a theoretical treatment of laws of nature constitute the tools of learning. This is called the scientific method. It is based upon the application of both deductive and inductive reasoning. By contrast, in the sphere of the supernatural a totally different means of achieving knowledge and understanding is necessary. Scientific method obviously no longer applies. But God has provided another method. It is divine revelation. The Bible is the text book as well as the primary reference. The Holy Spirit replaces human reason. The rules of causality apply but they are not the rules of natural causality or the laws of nature. In fact the Bible cautions strongly against the practice of relying upon human reason within this realm. (1 Cor2:10-13)\nRespecting this understanding of the world, the domain of the natural gains a new perspective. With it certain implications are apparent. For example, the Bible is a book of history. The careful reader will recognize that it is filled with historical detail to establish context, setting, and relevance. It's intent for historicity is exhaustive. But the Bible speaks of supernatural effects of worldwide impact such as the creation, the flood, and the long day of Joshua. These are pre-historic events by any other human record. They are beyond observation or laboratory experiment. If indeed the laws of nature were superseded in such events, then the laws of nature cannot be used to extrapolate with precision backwards beyond these particular points in time. And so we would do well to be very careful in applying the laws of nature, limited by human reasoning, to develop any natural picture of the pre-historic world or its chronology. This is not to say that natural laws do not to some extent fill in the picture, but any postulation based purely upon naturalistic reasoning is in danger of great error.\nAnother intriguing inference of this larger world view is that if God is a personal God involved in history as the Bible says and other supernatural beings are part of this world, then the realm of the natural must at some point meet the realm of the supernatural. Furthermore, man is also, as the Bible describes, more than just a physical body. He has a soul or spirit beyond the natural. Therefore it should not be beyond conception to expect a point of departure for the laws of nature. Assuming that point to be observable it might easily be overlooked if one is not cognizant of such a possibility. There are many areas of scientific investigation in which unexplainable phenomena or circumstances have arisen. Throughout history some of these have eventually been reconciled with further knowledge or reasoning. One noteworthy example is the development of relativity theory. Eventually, a number of previously unexplained experimental observations were shown to support the new concept which then led to a significantly new level of understanding. In contrast another development, that of quantum mechanics, led to a circumstance which could not be so easily reconciled. From this mystery emerged the debate over the role of random chance on natural laws to which Neils Bohr and Albert Einstein exchanged volleys. The source of the dilemma was later articulated and formalized by Heisenberg. Reduced to postulate it became known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, bearing his name. In simplest terms the principle states that because of the quantized or discrete nature of energy as presumed by quantum mechanics, the exact properties of matter and energy cannot at the same time be known completely. They may be formalized mathematically only by statistical or probabilistic means.\nFor example, a particle of matter such as an electron may have its position known exactly or its velocity known exactly but not both at the same time. Those who followed Bohr's thinking to its full conclusion would accept that the natural world was governed on some level by purely random phenomena, without causal relationship. On the other hand others, including Einstein, held to the strict belief that there was no place in the universe for non-deterministic phenomena. Either the theory could be harmonized with determinism or it was wrong. Einstein chose that it was wrong. Many conservative theologians and scholars might be tempted to chose the later conclusion also. This would warrant that Quantum mechanics would someday be proven inadequate or even wrong subsequently giving way to a more fitting theory to describe this aspect of the cosmos. And these scholars may well be proven correct. Certainly the former conclusion is not consistent with the God of the Bible. But consider for a moment an alternate conclusion lending itself to the recognition that God made a world of both the natural and the supernatural. Might there then be a point at which our investigation of the universe at its most basic level of understanding leads us to the edge of a cliff as it were. A precipice beyond which we peer, puzzled and confused, not able to apply natural reason any longer. As we look out over the expanse of the unknown we have a choice. To the pragmatic scientist randomness is an acceptable description of what he views. For the pure naturalist his only option is that he cannot yet see clearly; if he could all would be naturally explained. But perhaps rather than being just unknown, what lies beyond the ragged edge is actually unknowable by natural reasoning while still no less causal. The Bible tells us that man was created in the image of God. It also describes man as having a soul apart from the physical and a will to choose right and wrong. In these ways man is distinguished from God's other earthly creatures. Philosophers and theologians have long pondered the essence of man's freedom of will in a world of causality.\nConsider a simple process such as the deliberate moving of the index finger from left to right. One could explain the physical motion by reference to the skeletal and muscular anatomy of the hand. Muscle cells contract on one side of the finger. The muscle in connected to bones which are compelled to a lateral motion. Continuing the physiological trail one would describe the nerves which provided electrical impulses to excite the muscle cells. Along the arm the nerve cells form a chain which sequentially deliver an impulse by electro-chemical action. The appropriate nerve terminates at the base of the brain. From there one finds that the nerve is given its impetus by a further pathway of nerve endings which are connected to tissue in the brain itself. If it were possible, the originating electro-chemical stimulus could be isolated to a cell or group of cells in a motor function area of the brain. Careful investigation might reveal even a particular chemical process in one or more cells where the original physical stimulus emerged. But if one continues with such analysis, one of two conclusions will likely be reached. The first possibility would render the complex process just described completely deterministic, that is to say if one were able to, a naturally causal sequence of events could be found to explain even the origin of the thought process which results in the finger moving from left to right. The implication being that every human action and thought is purely deterministic, natural, instinctive, and a fateful consequence of preceding events. The second possibility would, however, allow that at some point in the previous analysis of motor actions an autonomous thought which is not restricted by natural cause or determinism represents the source stimulus for all further physiological processes. In other words every free human thought which leads to a physical reaction exceeds the bounds of the laws of nature as science is able to define them.\nWhat then of the implication of quantum mechanics? No one can be certain. Just the same it is interesting to consider that the theory of quantum mechanics appears to lead the thoughtful observer to the unnerving cliff, prompting the question of the limits to natural scientific thought. It is not in the question alone but in the possible answers that our concept of the universe is broadened. Certainly not random chance, but perhaps not total determinism either would explain the seemingly irreconcilable difficulty of this unknowable quantum world. It may be at such an end boundary of science where we find the beginning boundary of divine relationship with the world and with man.\nThe mysteries of quantum mechanical theory and its concepts have been characterized both as random chance or inadequate representations of deterministic reality. What appears to some to be random, to others inconsistent or at least lacking, may in actuality be a window between the \"natural\" and that which is beyond nature, the realm where supernatural causality finds expression in the natural, where the divine guides the simple, where freedom of will finds its origin. Such a consideration does not diminish God's sovereignty. Quite the contrary. Freedom of thought or will is a God given attribute. He reigns supreme above this or any marvel of human or even angelic nature. Certainly we will never comprehend, this side of heaven, the full majesty of God's creation. But He has made clear that He is a personal God, interactive with and in the creation. Further, He is a God who lives and dwells within man, \"For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" (Phil. 2:13) However He chooses to accomplish His work, whether through the laws of nature and scientific formalism, whether through humanly discernible reasoning, or through divine \"causality\" beyond man's ability to apply equation or human reason with \"ways past finding out\", God's creation humbles all mortal praise.\nReferences:\n1.

It may be at such an end boundary of science where we find the beginning boundary of divine relationship with the world and with man.\nThe mysteries of quantum mechanical theory and its concepts have been characterized both as random chance or inadequate representations of deterministic reality. What appears to some to be random, to others inconsistent or at least lacking, may in actuality be a window between the \"natural\" and that which is beyond nature, the realm where supernatural causality finds expression in the natural, where the divine guides the simple, where freedom of will finds its origin. Such a consideration does not diminish God's sovereignty. Quite the contrary. Freedom of thought or will is a God given attribute. He reigns supreme above this or any marvel of human or even angelic nature. Certainly we will never comprehend, this side of heaven, the full majesty of God's creation. But He has made clear that He is a personal God, interactive with and in the creation. Further, He is a God who lives and dwells within man, \"For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" (Phil. 2:13) However He chooses to accomplish His work, whether through the laws of nature and scientific formalism, whether through humanly discernible reasoning, or through divine \"causality\" beyond man's ability to apply equation or human reason with \"ways past finding out\", God's creation humbles all mortal praise.\nReferences:\n1.

Taking this metaphor to another level, to a scientist, the whole universe is a colossal party with a cosmic dance on dance fl oors at all levels, ranging from an expanding universe with swirling galaxies, to planets revolving around their suns, to organisms of all shapes and sizes dancing through their life cycles, to molecules in action inside living and nonliving systems, to atoms making and breaking bonds to make molecules and crystals, to electrons dancing around the nucleus of atoms, and so on. The universe and everything in it, living and nonliving, originally started (and still starts) at the microscopic level, a level too small for human senses to resolve. In this book, we focus on the concept of micro in contrast to that of macro; micro means anything small enough not to be seen by the naked eye, including the size scales of micrometers, nanometers, and smaller items. Because the universe and everything in it is comprised of microentities, to fully understand the macro we need to understand the micro.\nHumans, the macrobeings, have evolved to a relatively advanced level. For better or for worse we are late comers to this party of life on Earth. On the scale of a 12 - h clock, if the party started at the hour zero (i.e., midnight) with the solidifi cation of the earth \u2019 s crust, and if it is noon now, we have just arrived at 1:59:59. However, now that we have arrived, we are the most curious and ambitious creatures at the party. We want to know everything about everyone and everything in the party: Who (or what) are you? What are you made of? How did you get here? Where are you from, no I mean where are you originally from? Where are you headed, that is, what is your future?\nof all sciences\nP.1\nTHREE SECRETS OF NATURE\nAll the answers accumulated from our age old queries have uncovered the three most important higher - level secrets of nature, important and general enough that they should become part of the thinking of scientists and students\nAt fi rst glance, the diversity around us is obvious and ubiquitous. However, during the entire history of the development of science, the history of discoveries and inventions, nature has taught us a very powerful lesson over and over again: Look for the underlying unity behind apparent diversity of things and phenomena, and therefore behind the laws governing those things and phenomena. In my opinion, the three most salient of all the secrets of nature that science has discovered so far are the following:\nThere Is an Underlying Unity Behind Apparent Diversity\nThis concept is a\nkey point to understanding not only the things and phenomena around us, but also their diversity. For example, all life is made up of the same basic building block of life: the cell. Most great discoveries and breakthroughs in the history of science have revealed this secret over and over again: unity behind diversity.\nAll Macroscopic Things Are Composed of Smaller Building Blocks\nThis\nPREFACE xxix truth exists at various levels. For example, all materials around us are made up of molecules or crystals, all molecules and crystals are made of atoms, which in turn are made of subatomic particles (proton, neutron, and electron), protons and neutrons are made of quarks, and so on. This is also true about living organisms. For example, we are made of organs, organs are made of tissues, tissues are made of cells, cells are made of and run by the molecules of life and atoms or ions, and the molecules of life are made of atoms, and so on. This structural hierarchy is also apparent in our own inventions, for example, there are rooms contained in buildings, the buildings are contained in neighborhoods, and the neighborhoods make up a City, and so on.\nScale\nThis statement means that if you really want to understand a\nexistence of a microworld\nNature Does Its Most Important and Fundamental Work on a Smaller macroscopic structure, you will need to understand its smaller building blocks. The bottom line is we cannot have the macroworld without the\nThe underlying unity behind diversity has been the key to major breakthroughs in the sciences. The history of physics can be told in terms of discovering the unifi cation of multiple forces. For example, the terrestrial force that keeps us bound to the Earth and the celestial force that keeps the planets bound to the Sun are the same force: gravity. This realization helped Newton formulate the law of universal gravitation that applies to earth - bound problems, as well as explains the empirical laws of planetary motion discovered by Kepler. Unifying theories of electric and magnetic forces into a single theory of a force, called the electromagnetic (EM) force, was another great feat in physics, and the classical theory of EM is based on this unifi cation. We now know from physics that our universe is shaped and governed by four fundamental forces: gravitational, EM, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear forces. For many, this may be unity enough, but the attempts to discover further unifi cation continued, and there is great scientifi c evidence that even these four forces are different low - energy manifestations of a single force that was in action at the very beginning of the creation of the universe.\nThis history of unifi cation of forces is intertwined with the history of discovering and understanding the smaller and smaller building blocks of matter. For example, physicists (and chemists) discovered that all materials around us are made of smaller components called molecules; the molecules are made of even smaller components called atoms; and atoms in turn are made of yet smaller constituents called neutrons, protons, and electrons. Physicists have probed neutrons and protons, and have discovered that they are made of even smaller and more fundamental particles called quarks. Therefore, the path of development that physics, and as a result other disciplines of science, have taken is the path from the macro (large) to the micro (small). As mentioned earlier, the reason for this is that we, the humans, are macrobeings and we\nx PREFACE started observing things with the most primitive tools, our fi ve senses (e.g., our eyes), which were the only tools easily available to us. These tools are limited to the macroworld. However, to our advantage, we humans had a capability that other organisms did not have, and that is, to develop tools and techniques: say technology. The gradual development of technology, and hence better tools (e.g., microscopes), enabled us to continue our journey of understanding and exploration from the macroworld of planets and visible objects around us to the microworld of molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles. In fact, by extending this idea we fi nd there is a feedback loop between technology and basic fundamental science. As science evolves, new technologies emerge and in turn these new technologies allow for the creation of better and more powerful scientifi c tools. These tools in turn allow for new observations that lead to an even better understanding of the microscopic world, and so the cycle goes. For example, the colossal colliders at the particle physics lab at CERN (near Geneva, Switzerland) would not be possible without the capability of tracking particles to the precision of micrometers and microseconds provided by this technology, which itself is based on physics.\nCombining the three secrets of nature, the truths of unifi cation and the unity behind diversity are essential to our journey from the macro to the micro. This relationship among these three secrets of nature is the reason it has taken us this long to fi nd them: the whole history of the development of science on this planet.\nphilosophy\nP.2\nFROM NATURAL PHILOSOPHY TO PHYSICS\nRather ironically, when we had less information and knowledge than we have today, it appeared as if one person could know everything, and there was only one discipline called natural philosophy , the study of nature and the physical universe. Today \u2019 s physics is actually the modern version of natural\nIn olden times, natural philosophy referred to the study of nature and the physical universe. It served as a precursor to developing fi elds of natural sciences led by physics. Rest aside physics, modern notions of science and scientists date only to the nineteenth century. Before then, the word \u201c science \u201d simply meant knowledge and the title scientist did not exist. For centuries, scientists were called natural philosophers, and these practitioners often pursued a wide variety of interests. A remnant of that heritage is a doctorate in physics, or other sciences, which is still called a Ph.D., and is an abbreviation for doctor of philosophy. The title of Isaac Newton \u2019 s scientifi c treatise published in 1687, commonly known as the Principia, is called The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy . So, it is not a coincidence that long - established Chairs of Natural Philosophy at older universities are currently occupied largely by physics professors. The connection between physics and other disciplines of science can also be understood from the fact that all other fi elds of\nPREFACE xxxi science are historically developed from natural philosophy or its descendants. During the fourteenth and fi fteenth centuries, the term natural philosophy was referred to what is now called physical science. By the mid - nineteenth century, with the increase of information and knowledge, it became increasingly clear that it was not generally practical for scientists to contribute to numerous areas. Thus specialization occurred and now there were physicists, chemists, biologists, geologists, and so on.\nP.3\nPHYSICS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE\nBeing the most fundamental of all the sciences, physics has profoundly affected all science fi elds. Given its fundamental nature, students in many fi elds are required to take some physics courses in order to understand the fundamental principles underlying many phenomena across many science disciplines. In this sense, physics is intimately related to other sciences, and also to applied fi elds, such as engineering, medicine, and now nanotechnology. This is because principles discovered in physics apply to all natural sciences. For example, the principle of conservation of energy is common to all physical and chemical systems.\nChemistry is the scientifi c study of matter and materials and the changes that they undergo; matter is anything that exists, has mass, and occupies space; whereas a material is any kind of matter that can be used for something, such as glass. Starting with the macroworld as physics did, early chemistry largely dealt with substances, such as extracting metals from their ores, making pigments for cosmetics and painting, and fermenting beer and wine. Chemistry is the science that not only is most affected by physics, but also overlaps or collaborates with physics in many areas of study, such as atoms, molecules, and collections of atoms and molecules. A great example of the interaction between physics and chemistry is the quantum mechanical explanation of the relationships among chemical elements and the rules of their interaction (reactions) with one another captured in the periodic table.\nBiology is the scientifi c study of life; that is, the study of living things and the phenomena related to them. Like physics and chemistry, biology also began its journey in the macroworld: fi nding and studying things that you can see with your naked eye, doing the counting, classifying them, and so on. By now, however, biology has progressed into the microworld in different disciplines, such as microbiology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. There are an enormous number of physical phenomena involved in developing a single cell into an organism and then maintaining the organism. In order to fully understand life, all these phenomena will be understood in terms of the principles of physics. Many key advances in the biological sciences already have been made possible by physics - based techniques. Some examples being used to study the molecules of life are the optical microscope to study cells, X - ray diffraction used to discover the structure of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\nxi PREFACE molecule, and the electron microscope. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a quantum mechanical phenomenon, is revolutionizing the fi eld of medicine in the form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). With developments in genetics and molecular biology, an overwhelming amount of data is being generated in biology. The only way biologists will be able to fully make sense of these data is by developing a theoretical framework based on physics principles. Quite possibly in this process, we will discover new physics laws, partly because biological systems are generally different in some important ways from the physical systems that led to the current physics laws. After all, during its early days, biology helped physics in the discovery of the principle of conservation of energy. This principle was fi rst realized and proposed by Dr. Julius Robert Mayer, a practicing physician, in terms of the amount of heat taken in and given out by a living body.\nNeedless to say, physics is also at the foundation of engineering and technology. Understanding the application of physics laws is necessary from designing a bike to an interplanetary spacecraft, from typewriters to computers, from a horse and wagon to a sports car, and from a radio to a fl at screen TV. It is the understanding of matter at the atomic level, developed by discovering physics laws, that led to the semiconductor and microchip industry, and subsequently to computing, which led to the Internet revolution and the information age. Information technology has already become the fi ber of all aspects of life in the modern world.\nAlthough understanding the microworld at the atomic level, which was developed by physics, has been used in many fi elds, such as engineering and technology, we could not directly control microobjects, such as molecules and atoms. A big part of the reason is although physics studies in the twentieth century reached the levels of subatomic particles, such as quarks, other fi elds have been taking their time to catch up with molecules and atoms. Toward the end of the twentieth century, however, studies in most science fi elds had reached the level of molecules and gave rise to nanoscience and nanotechnology. This was fi rst envisioned by a great physicist Richard Feynman, and expressed on December 29, 1959 during his talk at the meeting of the American Physical Society at California Institute of Technology titled: There Is Plenty of Room at the Bottom. This event is now considered to be the beginning of nanotechnology. Using nanotechnology, which is the application of nanoscience, enables us to control matter at the level of molecules and atoms: Mind the difference between understanding and controlling. So, welcome to the twenty - fi rst century, the age of molecules.\nP.4\nQUANTUM PHYSICS: THE SCIENCE OF THE\nAs mentioned earlier, all things macro are composed of things micro. It is the same truth that is being told through different stories in different disciplines.\nPREFACE xi\nA chemist will tell us that everything is made of atoms. A physicist will even go farther and tell us that the universe started off from a few fundamental particles, such as quarks and electrons: Quarks combined to make neutrons and protons, which combine to make nuclei. A nucleus combined with electrons to make atoms, which in turn bonded together to make molecules, and so on. A biologist will tell us that life evolved from certain molecules, which combined into the basic unit of life called a cell. Cells evolved into a whole variety of unicellular and multicellular organisms due to mutations in the genes, the source of evolution. These stories are telling us that nature has designed everything in the universe, living and nonliving, at a microscopic level from the bottom up.\nBeing human, our greatest blessing and our greatest curse has been that we are macrobeings, whereas the universe was built from the bottom up, we started investigating it from the top down. Obviously, the fi rst things we saw and tried to understand around us were the macro items: our eyes laid upon stars, not atoms. This is why the history of physics started from planets, or other celestial and terrestrial bodies, and eventually made its way to atoms and subatomic particles. Similarly, the discipline of biology started from the study of living organisms, such as plants and animals, and made its way up to cells and the molecules in the cell. So, we had it backwards, and in this sense we have been very good reverse engineers.\nWe can boast as much as we like about our superiority to other organisms, but the fact remains that we as humans have our own limitations in understanding this universe. First, we can only investigate and understand so many things in our life time. Second, we can only investigate, gather information, obtain knowledge, and develop our understanding piecemeal. Some pieces may look different from each other at the surface. However, they may just be different facets of the same thing at some other level. Having only a partial knowledge, which are in different pieces, helps to obscure the big picture. Nature works the way it does without caring about our limitations. For example, nature did not create and does not need the borders and interfaces between different disciplines of science such as physics, chemistry, biology, and so on. These borders are the creations of our own limitations.\nHere is another problem. Our common sense is built upon our experience with the macroscopic world. Therefore, the physics built from interacting with the macroscopic world, called Newtonian or classical physics (also called Newtonian and classical mechanics) makes sense to us. However, when our scientifi c studies entered the microscopic world, the laws of classical physics collapsed right before our eyes. Quantum physics came to our rescue and to this date has successfully explained microscopic structures and phenomena. Due to our macroscopic common sense and intuition, even the pioneers of quantum physics had, and we continue to have, trouble with digesting quantum physics. Common sense tells us, it only makes sense that it does not make sense to our common sense, because common sense is built from our experience with the macroscopic world. As you will see in this book, quantum phenomena\nxxxiv PREFACE brutally violate our common sense. You will also see that classical physics actually is a special case, an approximation, of quantum physics. This means quantum physics is more fundamental, which is consistent with the fact that the universe is designed at the microscopic level, and is built from the bottom up. Therefore the reality of the macroworld that we experience on a daily basis has its roots in the microworld of atoms and molecules. This is also refl ected by how a human is developed even today: Two half - cells (sperm and egg) join to make a zygote, which divides and develops into an embryo. Embryonic cells differentiate to make different parts of the body, and subsequently we have a full human being within months.\nEven though quantum physics is more fundamental and general and classical physics is only an approximation of quantum physics, classical physics, which is an approximate science, works well in the macroworld. The reason is because those approximations are at the microscale; that is, they are so small they easily go unnoticed. So, while dealing with the macroworld, we can study and use classical physics and leave quantum physics for the microworld.\nHowever, there is a problem with this approach, and hence an opportunity to be captured. As already mentioned, physics and its direct applications, as well as biology, chemistry, materials science, and other fi elds, have already entered the microworld. This situation has two aspects: individual and collective. Individual fi elds are developing their own subfi elds corresponding to the microscale, such as microbiology and molecular biology. All these fi elds are collectively organizing their efforts into what is termed as nanoscience and nanotechnology. For example, the entire fi eld of molecular biology is biology at the microscale, or nanoscale level to be precise: The diameter of a DNA molecule is \u223c 2 nm, for example.\nAs nanoscience and, consequently, nanotechnology are progressing, we are learning how to handle and control molecules and atoms at individual levels. This opens the door to an endless array of opportunities, so much so that many of us are already calling the twenty - fi rst century the nanoage or the molecular age. Quantum physics is the law of the land in the molecular age of the twenty - fi rst century.\nP.5\nWHY THIS BOOK\nBecause everything is made of atoms, the macroscopic reality of our everyday experience in the macroworld has its roots in the microscopic world. So, here is the key to generating new ideas in making progress in all sciences in modern times: There are many things that atoms and molecules do, which cannot be understood in terms of what objects in the macroworld can do; whereas there is nothing that macroobjects do that cannot be understood in terms of what atoms and molecules can do. Quantum physics is the science that helps us to understand what atoms and molecules can do.\nPREFACE xxxv\nWith this realization and with the fact that much of modern science, engineering, and technology are already dealing with molecules and atoms, comes the increased need to learn quantum mechanics even for nonphysics majors, such as chemistry, biology, engineering, materials science, computer science, nanotechnology, and related fi elds. This book, designed as a complete course in quantum mechanics for these nonphysics majors, can be used as a textbook for a stand - alone course in quantum mechanics. It can be part of another course or a series of courses, such as modern physics and physical chemistry, or as a part of a short program, such as nanotechnology. This book presents a rich, self - contained, cohesive, concise, yet comprehensive picture of quantum mechanics for senior undergraduate and fi rst - year graduate student, nonphysics majors, and for those professionals at the forefront of biology, chemistry, engineering, computer science, materials science, nanotechnology, and related fi elds.\nMost, if not all, books on quantum physics written for science students use abstract mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics and leave its implications and connections to the real world often nonintuitive. This kind of framework may be necessary for physics students, but often is a learning hurdle for nonphysics majors. However, the centerpiece of this mathematical system and of quantum mechanics is the wave function. This book begins with the wave function, which the students have already learned about during their introductory course in classical (Newtonian) physics while learning about waves, and uses simple calculus, which most science major students learn in their junior undergraduate years, to develop and explain the concepts and principles of quantum mechanics. Comprehensive coverage of quantum theory, supported by experimental results and explained through applications and examples, is presented without the use of abstract and complex mathematical tools and formalisms, such as bra \u2013 ket vectors, Hilbert space, matrix algebra, or group theory. Other features of this book that help take the mystery out and bring quantum mechanics home for nonphysics students, researchers, scientists, and technologists include the following:\n1\nIt is shown throughout the book how quantum principles generate the\nsame results as classical physics when we move from the micro - to the macroworld. Due to its universal importance across different fi elds, another principle emphasized throughout the book is the natural tendency of systems to be in a state of equilibrium, that is, in a state of minimum energy.\n2\nThroughout the book, concepts and principles of quantum physics are\nexplained in the language of nonphysics majors by presenting examples and applications from nonphysics fi elds including chemistry, biology, nanotechnology, and related fi elds.\n3\nLiving in the Quantum World, a section at the end of each chapter,\nfeatures real - world applications of one or more quantum mechanics principles discussed in the chapter.\n4\nEnough study checkpoints and problems with solutions are presented\nxxxvi PREFACE throughout the book to make diffi cult concepts easy to understand.\n5\nThe interfaces and connections between quantum physics and nonphys-\nics fi elds, such as biology, chemistry, computing, and nanotechnology, are identifi ed or introduced in an easy to understand fashion.\n6\nAll concepts and principles of quantum physics are explained from\nscratch the fi rst time they appear and no prior knowledge of quantum physics is assumed.\n7\nThe material is presented in a logical learning sequence: a section builds\nupon previous sections and a chapter builds upon previous chapters. There is no hopping from topic to topic and no jargon without explanation.\n8\nPictures, illustrations, tables, notes, and cautions are used to help us to\nunderstand the diffi cult and tricky concepts.\n9\nTo ease the reader smoothly into the chapter, each chapter begins with\nan interesting picture with a light amusing note that is in a direct or subtle way related to the main issue in the chapter.\n10\nTo inspire the students, the quantum mechanics related individual\nkeeping the presentation interesting\nachievements within the communal environment are emphasized by presenting brief biographies throughout the book. It also contributes to\nFurthermore, this book takes advantage of the amazing story of how quantum mechanics was developed. The concepts and principles that make the foundation of quantum theory are developed in the context of the history of the gradual development of quantum mechanics, which some of us fi nd as amazing as quantum mechanics itself. This facilitates the introduction of the key concepts and principles of quantum physics as explanations for the results of those historic experiments that could not be explained with classical physics. In doing so, the book illustrates in an interesting way the process of scientifi c discoveries and advances.\nAfter introducing the foundational concepts and principles of quantum mechanics, such as quantization, the uncertainty principle, quantum mechanical tunneling, and wave \u2013 particle duality in the context of explaining the results of historical experiments in the fi rst few chapters, they are woven together in the formalism of quantum mechanics. Subsequently, quantum theory is presented in a single wave equation called the Schr \u00f6 dinger wave equation. The forthcoming chapters demonstrate how the principles of quantum mechanics naturally arise when we apply this wave equation to solve physical problems. The relevance of these types of problems to nonphysics fi elds is demonstrated throughout the book.\nThe application of quantum physics to simple systems, such as the hydrogen atom and the periodic table of the elements, is extended in a logical way to complex systems, such as molecules and the assemblies of molecules. This\nPREFACE xxxvii covers the topics of molecular vibrations, molecular rotations, and quantum statistics of assemblies of molecules. Also covered are the quantum mechanical foundations of modern techniques used across several fi elds, such as atomic and molecular spectroscopy, lasers, NMR imaging, and electron microscopy.\nP.6\nIN THIS BOOK\nThe laws of classical mechanics, or classical physics, were developed over the centuries by many scientists. Astronomers made contributions due to their interest in the heavenly (extraterrestrial or celestial) bodies. For example, the experiments, observations, and their explanation by Galileo Galilei (1564 \u2013 1642) laid the foundations for the important discoveries that were made in the following two centuries. Issac Newton (1642 \u2013 1727), another giant fi gure of those times, clearly understood the relationship among different variables involved in the motion of objects and put the work of centuries into three elegantly simple laws known as Newton \u2019 s laws of motion. Newton \u2019 s greatest contribution was the unifi cation of terrestrial and extraterrestrial (celestial) forces when he pointed out that the motion of planets around the sun can be understood by the same laws that govern the motion on Earth. Newton \u2019 s laws make the foundation of classical physics, which includes Maxwell \u2019 s equation of EM forces, unifying the concept of electric and magnetic forces into one force: the EM force. All these concepts that make up the core of classical physics are reviewed in Chapter 1 in a concise, but cohesive fashion. The core assumption of classical physics is that physical entities exist in two different types: particles and waves. This assumption is clearly refl ected in the fact that classical mechanics (mechanics of particles) and optics (as waves) are two independent disciplines in physics with their own set of principles and laws and with their own series of experiments and course works. So, Chapter 1 is oriented toward making a clear distinction between waves and particles: either you are a particle or you are a wave. This treatment by classical physics of particles and waves as two different types of entities mirrors the physical reality that we experience as macrobeings. It makes sense to us to treat material bodies or objects as particles and to treat some other phenomena as waves that do not fi t into the particle picture, such as a ripple that spreads out from a single point of impact when you throw a little rock into a body of still water.\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, because the objects of the macroscopic world are constituted of the objects of the microscopic world, the physical reality experienced by us in the macroworld has its roots in the microworld. Just before (or during the early days of) probing the microworld, the laws of classical physics were working so well that some scientists toward the end of the nineteenth century were becoming rather smug and making statements such as the one by William Thomson Kelvin in 1900: \u201c There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement. \u201d\nxxxviii PREFACE\nBut even Kelvin knew that there were challenges coming from the microworld, which he referred to in his speech in 1900 to the Royal Institution as \u201c two clouds on the horizon \u201d . The two clouds that Kelvin was referring to were the failure to fi nd a medium through which EM waves would travel and the explanation of black - body radiation. The fi rst cloud gave rise to Einstein \u2019 s theory of relativity, which is very briefl y mentioned in Chapter 1 . The second cloud eventually led to the development of quantum physics. So much for Kelvin \u2019 s prediction of the end of physics.\nChapter 2 describes how the experimental results from experiments, such as black - body radiation and the photoelectric effect, challenged the notion that EM waves (light) were just waves. Black - body radiation was one of the fi rst experiments where classical physics broke down in explaining the results from the microworld. It is shown how quantum concepts were introduced to explain experimental results.\nChapter 3 discusses how another set of experiments challenged the classical notion that particles, such as electrons, are just particles and not waves. It explains how the core assumption of classical physics that particles and waves are two separate components of the physical reality, breaks down in front of experimental results from the microworld. These results can only be explained with the particle \u2013 wave duality of nature: A physical entity acts as a particle under certain conditions and as waves under a different set of conditions.\nWave \u2013 particle duality is at the heart of quantum physics. It gives rise to two very important concepts in quantum physics: probability (or uncertainty) and quantization. An example of probability (or uncertainty) is that you cannot predict with certainty the position and momentum of an entity at a given instant; you can only assign probabilities to different possible values of position and momentum. Quantization means that a confi ned entity, such as an electron in an atom, is only allowed to have certain discreet values of energy. Both of these concepts go against the grain of classical physics, where you can predict the position and momentum of a particle at a given moment and the particle can have any energy, not only certain discrete values of energy. However, as Chapter 4 explains, this quantum picture explains the experimental results well from the study of atoms in terms of Bohr \u2019 s model. His model explains in a somewhat ad hoc way how quantization keeps the electron in the atom from collapsing into the nucleolus as predicted by classical physics. Chapter 4 also describes how Bohr \u2019 s model explains the spectral lines emitted by heated gases, another puzzle that the physicists were facing toward the end of the nineteenth century. The Bohr model, although a semiclassical or semiquantum mechanical model, demonstrates the power of quantization.\nSo, Chapters 2 \u2013 4 introduce in a logical way some fundamentals of quantum mechanics in terms of the hypotheses and laws put forward by different scientists in the beginning of the twentieth century to explain some physical phenomena that classical physics failed to explain. Chapter 5 puts these fundamentals together into a few postulates and develops a minimal formalism of quantum mechanics for the rest of the book. This chapter also shows how\nPREFACE xxxix these postulates can be summed together into one equation: The Schr \u00f6 dinger equation, the fundamental equation of quantum physics.\nChapter 6 is devoted to taking the mystery out of the Schr \u00f6 dinger equation by examining its solutions through its application to simple, but abundantly practical problems, such as confi nement and vibration (or oscillation). Most of the systems in the universe are confi ned or bonded to their environment, such as in electrons in an atom, atoms in a molecule, and so on. It is a natural tendency of a system to be in equilibrium, and when disturbed it will oscillate (or vibrate) about its equilibrium position, such as atoms in a molecule or a crystal. These countless examples in nature can be modeled in various ways, such as a particle in a box (confi nement) and a harmonic oscillator (vibrations about an equilibrium position). While applying the Schr \u00f6 dinger equation to these two situations in Chapter 6 , we demonstrate how solving the Schr \u00f6 dinger equation naturally gives rise to the principles and laws of quantum mechanics discussed in the previous chapters.\nAll matter (living and nonliving) is made up of atoms. Hydrogen, which makes up 9.5% of the human body mass, consists of the simplest atom: A confi ned system of one electron bound to one proton in the nucleus. Chapter 7 demonstrates how applying the Schr \u00f6 dinger equation to this simple system naturally gives rise to some quantum mechanical concepts and principles, such as quantization, principle quantum number, orbital quantum number, magnetic quantum number, and the rules associated with these quantum numbers.\nThe structure and properties of atoms show a pattern displayed in the periodic table of elements. One of the greatest triumphs of quantum mechanics is to present an explanation for this pattern. This topic is discussed in Chapter 8 , which also introduces the quantum mechanical concept of spin and spin quantum number along with Pauli \u2019 s exclusion principle, regarding the occupation of quantum states. The exclusion principle also plays an important role in determining the electronic confi guration of atoms.\nAtoms bound together to make molecules including the molecules of life: carbohydrates, DNA, lipids, and proteins. The quantum states of molecules in terms of rotation and vibration of diatomic molecules are discussed in the framework of molecular spectroscopy in Chapter 9 . There are many physical, chemical, and biological situations in which a large number of atoms or molecules are involved. The behavior of such collections or assemblies and the relationships of individual constituents to the collection are studied in statistical mechanics: statistics fused with mechanical laws. Some basic concepts and principles of statistical mechanics are developed in Chapter 10 , where we clearly explore the interface between classical and quantum statistical mechanics. The vibrations and rotations of molecules are revisited in the collective statistical environment.\nNow that almost all the sciences, including biology, chemistry, materials science, and computer science, that began with macroscopic studies are meeting physics in the microscopic, including the nano, world of molecules and atoms, the twenty - fi rst century is shaping up to be the molecular age. Due to these\nxl PREFACE common issues and problems that scientists are dealing with on this size scale, this area in all sciences is collectively developing as nanoscience. The developing fi eld of nanotechnology, the application of nanoscience, is increasingly allowing us to handle molecules and atoms at individual levels. Chapter 1 discusses quantum mechanics as a common thread through different fi elds of nanoscience and nanotechnology.\nP.7\nBACK TO THE FUTURE\nHistory repeats itself in interesting ways at various levels. As already mentioned, all science disciplines that directly or indirectly emerged from one discipline, which was natural philosophy, are now converging in many ways into one fi eld called nanoscience and its application, which is nanotechnology. Quantum physics, being the science of the small, is the common thread that runs through all these fi elds at the nano and smaller scales.\nFinally, let us borrow a metaphor and its elaboration from Richard Feynman who, once referring to an unknown poet, said \u201c The whole universe is in a glass of wine \u201d . We do not know what the poet really meant by this, but a number of scientists from different disciplines sitting around a wine glass can together actually see the entire universe in it. A biologist, for example, sees the fermentation, the bacteria, and hence life. A chemist sees an interesting array of chemicals, ferments, enzymes, product, whereas a physicist sees the refl ections and refraction in the glass, and the swirling evaporating liquid. Physicists and chemists both see the molecules of alcohol and atoms, such as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; the physicist sees protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the atoms and the quarks from which the atoms are composed. These are the same quarks from which the whole universe is made. Where did the glass come from? Rocks \u2026 fossils \u2026 secrets of life and the universe \u2026 evolution of stars \u2026 we can go on and on. I do not want to spoil the party, but remember, it is our small minds (our limitations), that divide this glass of wine, the universe, into physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and so on; nature sees no such divisions.\nSo, again about this glass of wine in the words of Feynman: \u201c Let \u2019 s put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more fi nal pleasure: drink it and forget it all! \u201d The party of life and the dance of the universe will continue. Take this book as a micro or quantum celebration of this party.\nApril 2010 Silicon Valley, California\nP aul S anghera\n"}, {"score": 2511.5264, "uuid": "e632b9ac-9407-5372-bbe8-b366f2554aa9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0907wb-02-10536", "target_hostname": "terrytao.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/02/26/quantum-mechanics-and-tomb-raider/", "page_rank": 1.7157279e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em> <em>and</em> Tomb Raider \u00ab What\u2019s new", "snippet": "Classical <em>physics</em> <em>is</em> no stranger to probabilities.

It occurred to me that this type of informal, rambling discussion might actually be rather suited to the blog medium, so here goes nothing\u2026\nQuantum mechanics has a number of weird consequences, but here we are focusing on three (inter-related) ones:\nObjects can behave both like particles (with definite position and a continuum of states) and waves (with indefinite position and (in confined situations) quantised states);\nThe equations that govern quantum mechanics are deterministic, but the standard interpretation of the solutions of these equations is probabilistic; and\nIf instead one applies the laws of quantum mechanics literally at the macroscopic scale, then the universe itself must split into the superposition of many distinct \u201cworlds\u201d.\nIn trying to come up with a classical conceptual model in which to capture these non-classical phenomena, we eventually hit upon using the idea of using computer games as an analogy. The exact choice of game is not terribly important, but let us pick Tomb Raider \u2013 a popular game from about ten years ago (back when I had the leisure to play these things), in which the heroine, Lara Croft , explores various tombs and dungeons, solving puzzles and dodging traps, in order to achieve some objective. It is quite common for Lara to die in the game, for instance by failing to evade one of the traps. (I should warn that this analogy will be rather violent on certain computer-generated characters.)\nThe thing about such games is that there is an \u201cinternal universe\u201d, in which Lara interacts with other game elements, and occasionally is killed by them, and an \u201cexternal universe\u201d, where the computer or console running the game, together with the human who is playing the game, resides. While the game is running, these two universes run more or less in parallel; but there are certain operations, notably the \u201csave game\u201d and \u201crestore game\u201d features, which disrupt this relationship. These operations are utterly mundane to people like us who reside in the external universe, but it is an interesting thought experiment (which others have also proposed :-) ) to view them from the perspective of someone like Lara, in the internal universe. (I will eventually try to connect this with quantum mechanics, but please be patient for now.) Of course, for this we will need to presume that the Tomb Raider game is so advanced that Lara has levels of self-awareness and artificial intelligence which are comparable to our own.\nImagine first that Lara is about to navigate a tricky rolling boulder puzzle, when she hears a distant rumbling sound \u2013 the sound of her player saving her game to disk. Let us suppose that what happens next (from the perspective of the player) is the following: Lara navigates the boulder puzzle but fails, being killed in the process; then the player restores the game from the save point and then Lara successfully makes it through the boulder puzzle.\nNow, how does the situation look from Lara\u2019s point of view? At the save point, Lara\u2019s reality diverges into a superposition of two non-interacting paths, one in which she dies in the boulder puzzle, and one in which she lives. (Yes, just like that cat .) Her future becomes indeterministic. If she had consulted with an infinitely prescient oracle before reaching the save point as to whether she would survive the boulder puzzle, the only truthful answer this oracle could give is \u201c50% yes, and 50% no\u201d.\nThis simple example shows that the internal game universe can become indeterministic, even though the external one might be utterly deterministic. However, this example does not fully capture the weirdness of quantum mechanics, because in each one of the two alternate states Lara could find herself in (surviving the puzzle or being killed by it), she does not experience any effects from the other state at all, and could reasonably assume that she lives in a classical, deterministic universe.\nSo, let\u2019s make the game a bit more interesting. Let us assume that every time Lara dies, she leaves behind a corpse in that location for future incarnations of Lara to encounter. (This type of feature was actually present in another game I used to play , back in the day.) Then Lara will start noticing the following phenomenon (assuming she survives at all): whenever she navigates any particularly tricky puzzle, she usually encounters a number of corpses which look uncannily like herself. This disturbing phenomenon is difficult to explain to Lara using a purely classical deterministic model of reality; the simplest (and truest) explanation that one can give her is a \u201cmany-worlds\u201d interpretation of reality, and that the various possible states of Lara\u2019s existence have some partial interaction with each other. Another valid (and largely equivalent) explanation would be that every time Lara passes a save point to navigate some tricky puzzle, Lara\u2019s \u201cparticle-like\u201d existence splits into a \u201cwave-like\u201d superposition of Lara-states, which then evolves in a complicated way until the puzzle is resolved one way or the other, at which point Lara\u2019s wave function \u201ccollapses\u201d in a non-deterministic fashion back to a particle-like state (which is either entirely alive or entirely dead).\nNow, in the real world, it is only microscopic objects such as electrons which seem to exhibit this quantum behaviour; macroscopic objects, such as you and I, do not directly experience the kind of phenomena that Lara does and we cannot interview individual electrons to find out their stories either. Nevertheless, by studying the statistical behaviour of large numbers of microscopic objects we can indirectly infer their quantum nature via experiment and theoretical reasoning. Let us again use the Tomb Raider analogy to illustrate this. Suppose now that Tomb Raider does not only have Lara as the main heroine, but in fact has a large number of playable characters, who explore a large number deadly tombs, often with fatal effect (and thus leading to multiple game restores). Let us suppose that inside this game universe there is also a scientist (let\u2019s call her Jacqueline ) who studies the behaviour of these adventurers going through the tombs, but does not experience the tombs directly, nor does she actually communicate with any of these adventurers. Each tomb is explored by only one adventurer; regardless of whether she lives or dies, the tomb is considered \u201cused up\u201d.\nJacqueline observes several types of trapped tombs in her world, and gathers data as to how likely an adventurer is to survive any given type of tomb. She learns that each type of tomb has a fixed survival rate \u2013 e.g. a tomb of type A has a 20% survival rate, while a tomb of type B has a 50% survival rate \u2013 but that it seems impossible to predict with any certainty whether any given adventurer will survive any given type of tomb. So far, this is something which could be explained classically; each tomb may have a certain number of lethal traps in them, and whether an adventurer survives these traps or not may entirely be due to random chance.\nBut then Jacqueline encounters a mysterious \u201cquantisation\u201d phenomenon: the survival rate for various tombs are always one of the following numbers:\n;\nin other words, the \u201cfrequency\u201d of success for a tomb is always of the form 1/n for some integer n. This phenomenon would be difficult to explain in a classical universe, since the effects of random chance should be able to produce a continuum of survival probabilities.\nHere\u2019s what is going on. In order for Lara (say) to survive a tomb of a given type, she needs to stack together a certain number of corpses together to reach a certain switch; if she cannot attain that level of \u201cconstructive interference\u201d to reach that switch, she dies. The type of tomb determines exactly how many corpses are needed \u2013 suppose for instance that a tomb of type A requires four corpses to be stacked together. Then the player who is playing Lara will have to let her die four times before she can successfully get through the tomb; and so from her perspective, Lara\u2019s chances of survival are only 20%. In each possible state of the game universe, there is only one Lara which goes into the tomb, who either lives or dies; but her survival rate here is what it is because of her interaction with other states of Lara (which Jacqueline cannot see directly, as she does not actually enter the tomb).\nA familiar example of this type of quantum effect is the fact that each atom (e.g. sodium or neon) can only emit certain wavelengths of light (which end up being quantised somewhat analogously to the survival probabilities above); for instance, sodium only emits yellow light, neon emits blue, and so forth. The electrons in such atoms, in order to emit such light, are in some sense clambering over skeletons of themselves to do so; the more commonly given explanation is that the electron is behaving like a wave within the confines of an atom, and thus can only oscillate at certain frequencies (similarly to how a plucked string of a musical instrument can only exhibit a certain set of wavelengths, which incidentally are also proportional to 1/n for integer n). Mathematically, this \u201cquantisation\u201d of frequency can be computed using the bound states of a Schr\u00f6dinger operator with potential . (Now, I am not going to try to stretch the Tomb Raider analogy so far as to try to model the Schr\u00f6dinger equation! In particular, the complex phase of the wave function \u2013 which is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics \u2013 is not easy at all to motivate in a classical setting, despite some brave attempts .)\nThe last thing we\u2019ll try to get the Tomb Raider analogy to explain is why microscopic objects (such as electrons) experience quantum effects, but macroscopic ones (or even mesoscopic ones, such as large molecues) seemingly do not. Let\u2019s assume that Tomb Raider is now a two-player co-operative game, with two players playing two characters (let\u2019s call them Lara and Indiana ) as they simultaneously explore different parts of their world (e.g. via a split-screen display ). The players can choose to save the entire game, and then restore back to that point; this resets both Lara and Indiana back to the state they were in at that save point.\nNow, this game still has the strange feature of corpses of Lara and Indiana from previous games appearing in later ones. However, we assume that Lara and Indiana are entangled in the following way: if Lara is in tomb A and Indiana is in tomb B, then Lara and Indiana can each encounter corpses of their respective former selves, but only if both Lara and Indiana died in tombs A and B respectively in a single previous game. If in a previous game, Lara died in tomb A and Indiana died in tomb C, then this time round, Lara will not see any corpse (and of course, neither will Indiana). (This entanglement can be described a bit better by using tensor products : rather than saying that Lara died in A and Indiana died in B, one should instead think of\ndying in\n, which is a state which is orthogonal to\n.) With this type of entanglement, one can see that there is going to be significantly less \u201cquantum weirdness\u201d going on; Lara and Indiana, adventuring separately but simultaneously, are going to encounter far fewer corpses of themselves than Lara adventuring alone would. And if there were many many adventurers entangled together exploring simultaneously, the quantum effects drop to virtually nothing, and things now look classical unless the adventurers are somehow organised to \u201cresonate\u201d in a special way .\nOne might be able to use Tomb Raider to try to understand other unintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics , but I think I\u2019ve already pushed the analogy far beyond the realm of reasonableness, and so I\u2019ll stop here. :-)\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 2510.2444, "uuid": "3fa67111-003d-58c0-be4c-0d7f408ffb0e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1806wb-27-26180", "target_hostname": "www.philsoc.org", "target_uri": "http://www.philsoc.org/1960Fall/1500transcript.html", "page_rank": 1.1806919e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Sixty Years of <em>Quantum</em> <em>Physics</em>", "snippet": "Looking back over <em>the</em> various possibilities of things that might be suitable to talk about this evening, I thought it would be interesting to review <em>the</em> historical development of <em>what</em> I now would like to call <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em>, rather than <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em>, because it has grown <em>and</em> expanded in such a", "explanation": null, "document": "Sixty Years of Quantum Physics\nBy Edward U. Condon\nWashington University, St. Louis, Missouri\n[Read before the Society December 2, 1960]\nI was invited to speak on the occasion of the 1500th Regular Meeting of the Society, and of course am delighted to be able to come and do it. But those who conveyed the invitation could not refrain from reminding me that I owed the Society a retiring presidential address. I was President, in 1951, and it was in the fall of that year that I departed hastily to go to Corning Glass Works to be Director of Research. That was a very interesting experience, and I am still connected with the glass business, though I am also doing professing. I started my career in experimental physics and lasted one day. When I started work on a doctoral thesis at the University of California in 1925, I had to set up a vacuum system. All experimental physicists in those days had to get a Cenco pump on the floor and glass tubing up to something that was on the table. I started out like all the rest but broke so much glass the first day that they suggested I go into theoretical physics. I told this story at Corning after I became their Director of Research. Mr. Amory Houghton, Chairman of the Board, who is now our Ambassador to France, said, \"Isn't it good that at last you are in a place where you can't possibly break enough glass to make any difference.\"\nLooking back over the various possibilities of things that might be suitable to talk about this evening, I thought it would be interesting to review the historical development of what I now would like to call quantum physics, rather than quantum mechanics, because it has grown and expanded in such a way that it permeates all of modern physics. In fact it is extremely difficult to think of any actively cultivated part of physics that is not directly involved with Planck's quantum constant \"h\". The basic discovery by Planck was made within a week or two of exactly 60 years ago, so I thought it might be interesting to discuss this subject.\nThe subject of quantum physics started with the statistical theory of the distribution of energy in the black-body spectrum. The spectrum of radiated energy in equilibrium with matter in an enclosure is commonly called black-body radiation because it is the kind of radiation that would be emitted by a perfect absorber. The active problem in 1900 was the explanation of the distribution of energy in the spectrum.\nIt is interesting to realize that the subject has quite an ancient history. The first application of thermodynamics to black-body radiation goes back to 1859 when Kirchhoff first developed the ideas of radiative exchanges, and the connections between emission and absorption, rules according to which a good emitter is a good absorber, and a poor emitter is a poor absorber. In 1884 the discovery had been made of what we now call the Stefan-Boltzmann law, that the total radiation goes up as the fourth power of the absolute temperature. It was discovered by Stefan experimentally and interpreted theoretically by Boltzmann, making one of the earliest applications of thermodynamics to radiation after those first ideas of Kirchhoff's.\nIn 1894 came the discovery by Wien of the displacement law, which tells how the distribution of energy over various wavelengths changes with the absolute temperature. The big problem at that time was to try to understand the reason for this distribution. Contrary to the general belief, which has become true in the last 30 years or so, that all physics is really done by young men in their 20's, the discovery of Planck was done when he was at the advanced age of 42. In 1900 he had already put a part of his career of research work behind him and was a professor in the University of Berlin, so that his work on quantum physics was done 21 years after he had received his doctorate for a thesis on the second law of thermodynamics. His thesis, it is interesting to note, was done under Kirchhoff and Helmholtz at Berlin. In his autobiography he says that he is quite confident neither of them ever read it.\nThermodynamics was Planck's first love, his principal love throughout physics. In fact there are many indications that he was rather annoyed with his discovery of the Planck constant of action and did his best for about 15 years or so, on up to about 1915, to find ways of evading his own discovery and reconciling the theory that he had discovered with classical theory. This resembles somewhat the story that I used to hear from Professor Ladenburg at Princeton, about Roentgen. Everybody knows about the great consequences of Roentgen's discovery of the Roentgen rays, or x rays. Ladenburg was a student of Roentgen. He said that Roentgen was annoyed with his x rays because he did not understand what they were and much preferred classical subjects. So the upshot of it was that Ladenburg did a doctoral thesis under Roentgen just a few years after Roentgen had discovered x rays, on the subject of the correction to Stokes' law for a body falling through a viscous medium in a cylindrical tube, allowing for the finite diameter of the tube and the wall effect. They had a long pipe filled with castor oil, which is the traditional viscous material. It reached from the top floor of the laboratory to the basement. He said nothing ever gave Roentgen quite as much pleasure as to see the steel ball arrive down at the basement just when the calculation said it ought to. You can tell by a great deal of Planck's writings and readings that he felt much the same way about classical physics in relation to the modern developments.\nLord Rayleigh had published a theory that was based on the equipartition of energy doctrine, that goes back to Maxwell, Waterston, and Boltzmann, whereby every degree of freedom in the radiation field should have had the energy kT. He knew it did not, because that would have given an infinite or divergent result. But nevertheless that was where the theoretical thinking of that time led, and this served to point up the importance of the quantum modifications that had to be made.\nOne of the things that I found interesting in looking back in the history of this theory is that it has always been referred to as the Rayleigh-Jeans law, and I had supposed that Rayleigh and Jeans had worked together on it. In point of fact Rayleigh derived it and made a mistake by a factor of 8 and Jeans corrected that in a letter to Nature, so that dividing the original Rayleigh formula by 8 was Jeans' contribution.\nIt was an essential contribution because it is a mistake that we all might make very readily. In counting up the degrees of freedom in the radiation field that are associated with frequencies between n and n + dn one has to calculate how many integers there are whose squares add up to a certain value, and it is natural to take the volume of a sphere of a certain radius. But in fact only one takes an octant out of this sphere because the integers, all three of them, have to be positive, and that is where Rayleigh went wrong.\nThe radiation measurements that served to inspire Planck were being made at the Physikalische-Technische Reichsanstalt by some of the great names of early days of radiation measurement work: Lummer, Pringsheim, and Rubens. So that the problem of distribution of energy in the spectrum was very much to the fore and very good measurements were being made.\nIt was on October 19, 1900, that Planck presented his radiation formula to the German Physical Society at a meeting in Berlin, strictly as an empirical interpolation formula between the Rayleigh-Jeans law, which is valid at long wavelengths, and the Wien law, which is valid at short wavelengths. By interpolating in between he had been able to find a simple formula that extended across the whole regime. But at that time he had no theoretical basis for it whatever.\nThat night Rubens took the data to which he had access and made a very careful comparison with Planck's formula\u0097a more careful one than Planck himself had made at that time\u0097and found that it represented the data with extraordinary accuracy, much better than an empirical formula usually does. He called on Planck the next morning with a strong conviction that there was some real fundamental truth in the formula and not just an accidental agreement. Planck then set to work to find a theoretical basis for this formula and worked very hard for quite a while. In his biography he speaks of this as the most difficult period of his whole life.\nThen, just within less than two months, on December 14, 1900\u0097so we are just 12 days ahead of the 60th Anniversary\u0097he presented a paper to the Physical Society of Berlin in which he took the decisive step. By applying the Boltzmann principle for the connection of entropy with probability\u0097which up to that time had hardly been used at all\u0097he was able to work out the spectral distribution of energy that would be in equilibrium with a system of electrical oscillators.\nIn order to get the desired result he had to suppose that the energy of each oscillator was built up in finite steps of energy, whereas in all of physics hitherto energy had been a continuous variable. To agree with the Wien displacement law he then had to assume that the finite size of these steps was proportional to the frequency, and so the energy quanta were hn. In that way he arrived at the famous formula\nUn = 8phn3 / c3 (ehn/kT - 1)\nfor the density of the energy in the spectral frequency range between n and n + dn in black-body radiation at absolute temperature T. As is readily seen, in the limit of hn/kT small compared with 1 this formula transforms into the Jeans formula, and in the limit of hn large compared with kT it becomes the Wien formula and represents the data with great accuracy in between. Additional measurements of the same sort were later made with great precision at the National Bureau of Standards by W. W. Coblentz.\nOne of the most extraordinary things about this is the accuracy with which Planck was able to get these fundamental constants. At that time there was no good value available for Avogadro's number, or for the charge on the electron; and the values that Planck was able to get out of his work were much closer than is usually appreciated. When he first represented the data, in order to obtain a fit with the old black-body data he had to assume that h was 6.885\u00d710-27 erg/sec, and k, which we now call the Boltzmann constant, 1.429\u00d710-16 erg/\u00b0K. The present best value for the first number is 6.6252\u00d710-27 instead of 6.885\u00d710-27 and for the second number, 1.3804\u00d710-16 instead of 1.429\u00d710-16. At that very first time Planck got Planck's constant only about 4.4 percent too high, and Boltzmann's constant about 3.5 percent too high relative to the best modern values.\nThis was actually the first time that the Boltzmann constant had been evaluated. Let me just remind you of its relation with the other basic constants that have so much importance.\nThe gas constant, R, as we ordinarily know it, per gram mole, is equal to the Avogadro number, N, times k; and the Faraday, F, the amount of charge needed to plate out a gram mole of univalent ions, is equal to Avogadro's constant times the charge of the electron. That is R = Nk and F = Ne.\nThese molar quantities, R and F, were well known, and good values for them were available in those days, but what was not known was the Avogadro number N. However, if you know any one of these quantities you can get the other. So that as it turns out, the getting of the Boltzmann constant, k, enabled one to get N by the first equation, and then, using that N in combination with the knowledge of the Faraday, F, one was able to get the charge on the electron.\nThe electron had only been recognized about three years earlier by J. J. Thomson, and while the ratio of its charge to mass was known, its charge by itself was not well known. You will find in the literature of that time values published for e, the charge on the electron, ranging all the way from 1.29\u00d710-10 electrostatic units, on up to 6.5\u00d710-10 electrostatic units, which was given by J. J. Thomson, and a little while later revised back down to 3.4\u00d710-10. In other words, at that time one only knew the charge on the electron to a factor of about 5 or 6.\nOn the other hand if you take the value of the Faraday and the value of k and solve for N from the gas constant and then solve for e, you find, surprisingly enough, that e equals 4.69\u00d710-10 electrostatic units, which is only 2.3 percent below the presently recognized value.\nThus in the space of just a month or two Planck first found an empirical formula which to this day gives the most accurate representation of the spectral distribution of the radiant energy; second, he found a derivation of that formula. In order to get the derivation he had to introduce the extraordinary idea of energy quantization into physics. Third, he obtained an excellent value for the charge on the electron, which everybody was trying to do at that time.\nYou might expect that this would cause a great deal of excitement among physicists at that time, but it did not. If you search through the journals you find that practically nothing is said about Planck in the years 1900 through 1904. I was very much intrigued, therefore, when just before this meeting Mr. Marton recalled that a search of the records of this Society indicated that in 1902 Arthur L. Day gave a report on Planck's work. Thus The Philosophical Society of Washington was one of the earliest to pay attention to it.\nThe first real extension of Planck's work came with Einstein's famous paper of 1905, the paper for which he got the Nobel prize. (It is important to realize that Einstein did not get the Nobel prize for the theory of relativity. They might give it to him now if he were around, but they did not in those days.) Planck wrote only one other paper on the subject in that period between 1900 and 1905 and this was mainly an expository paper. There is one brief mention by Burbury, another paper by van der Waals, Jr., and that is all. In those days Planck was almost completely ignored.\nIn Planck's own autobiography he tells of his own attitude toward the Planck constant, and I thought it would be interesting to read his own words on that, of course translated into English. He said:\nWhile the significance of the quantum of action for the interrelation between entropy and probability was thus conclusively established, the great part played by this new constant in the uniform regular occurrence of physical processes still remained an open question. I therefore tried immediately to weld the elementary quantum of action, h, somehow into the framework of classical theory. But in the face of all such attempts the constant showed itself to be obdurate.\nSo long as it could be regarded as infinitesimally small, i.e., dealing with higher energies and longer periods of time, everything was in perfect order. But in the general case difficulties would arise at one point or another, difficulties which became more noticeable as higher frequencies were taken into consideration. The failure of every attempt to bridge that obstacle soon made it evident that the elementary quantum of action plays a fundamental part in atomic physics and that its introduction opened up a new era in natural science, for it heralded the advent of something entirely unprecedented and was destined to remodel basically the physical outlook and thinking of man which, ever since Leibniz and Newton laid the ground work for infinitesimal calculus, were founded on the assumption that all causal interactions are continuous.\nHe goes on in a more personal vein to say:\nMy futile attempts to fit the elementary quantum of action somehow into the classical theory continued for a number of years [actually until 1915] and they cost me a great deal of effort. Many of my colleagues saw in this something bordering on a tragedy. But I feel differently about it, for the thorough enlightenment I thus received was all the more valuable. I now knew for a fact that the elementary quantum of action played a far more significant part in physics than I had originally been inclined to suspect, and this recognition made me see clearly the need for the introduction of totally new methods of analysis and reasoning in the treatment of atomic problems.\nIn spite of Jeans' intimate association with this problem, you find no reference whatever to the Planck black-body law in the first edition of his Dynamical Theory of Gases, which was published in 1904, four years after Planck's work. In the Landolt-Bornstein Tables, published in 1905, we find an extraordinary thing, namely, that it gives widely different values for what is often called the Loschmidt number, the number of molecules in one cubic centimeter of various gases under standard conditions. Of course this value should be the same for all gases. But they solemnly give you a table with 2.1\u00d71019 for air, 4.2\u00d71019 for nitrogen, 7.3\u00d71019 for hydrogen, and so on. Apparently Landolt and Bornstein did not believe in the Avogadro number. Planck got 2.76\u00d71019 for this number, which as we have seen is a good value.\nJosiah Willard Gibbs was America's first great theoretical physicist. He was elected, I find, to membership in the Washington Academy of Sciences in 1900. He died in 1903 at the age of 64. There is no indication in any of his publications or notes that he left behind that he paid any attention to Planck's work. He had puzzled over the problem of the specific heat of polyatomic gases, which everybody was puzzled about at that time, because it has too low a value to correspond with the equipartition law. There is some indication that he found these difficulties with the equipartition law revealed in the specific heat of gases somewhat depressing, and I find an indication of that perhaps in an interesting paragraph from the preface to his famous work on statistical mechanics, published in 1902, a year before Gibbs' death:\nIn the present state of science it seems hardly possible to frame a dynamic theory of molecular action which shall embrace the phenomena of thermodynamics, of radiation and of the electrical rnanifestations which accompany the union of atoms. Yet any theory is obviously inadequate that does not take account of all these phenomena. [There is a wonderful sentence at the end of this paragraph which I think we all ought to realize was written by Gibbs in 1902.] Certainly one is building on an insecure foundation who rests his work on hypotheses concerning the constitution of matter.\nLord Kelvin's Baltimore lectures, which were delivered at The Johns Hopkins University in 1884, but were not published until 1904, had a great deal of revision up to that time. The preface to these is very interesting to those who have anything to do with editing or getting things through the press. He admits that he had been working on the revision for all of the 19 years. I can well imagine he was a popular fellow around the print shop.\nThat work includes as its appendix B, the famous lecture to which I am sure you have all heard allusions, \"Nineteenth Century Clouds over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light.\" That lecture was delivered in April 1900, some months before Planck's work, and then it was published originally in the Philosophical Magazine of July 1901. It makes no reference to the black-body radiation or to Planck's work, although cloud 2\u0097he had his clouds numbered\u0097was this same concern about the failure of equipartition of energy as evidenced by the specific heats of gases, the same problem that was troubling Gibbs.\nLord Rayleigh's publication of what we now call the Rayleigh-Jeans law was in the Philosophical Magazine in 1900. He did not return to the subject again until 1905 when he wrote several notes in Nature in which he concedes or agrees with the comment that Jeans had made about being wrong by a factor of 8. It is interesting in that he says that he \"has not succeeded in following Planck's reasoning.\" That is how Planck's work was received by Lord Rayleigh, one of the greatest British physicists. Rayleigh actually published papers actively through 1919, but he seems to have had no more to say on black-body radiation than what he said in that one 1905 paper.\nSearch through his published papers reveals two more items relating to modern quantum physics. In the 1906 Philosophical Magazine he comments on the classical radiative properties of the atom models that resemble J. J. Thomson's. However, he goes beyond them in that he regards the negative charge as distributed more like a continuous fluid and studies it as a normal mode of vibration problem. In an editorial note that he adds in his collected papers, written in 1911, he refers back to some old work of an 1897 paper. An interesting thing to me appears in this note when he comments that all kinds of models of normal modes of vibrations of continuous systems always come up with formulas in which the square of the frequency is written additively as the sum of contributions coming from the different degrees of freedom\u0097from what we would now call the different quantum numbers. Rayleigh was wedded to a classical vibration theory model where the squares of the frequencies get in because of the second derivative with regard to the time based on Newton's law of mechanics. Nowadays when we lecture on quantum mechanics we just quietly make the Schr\u00f6dinger equation contain the first time derivative so we will not have this trouble. That is the advantage of making up your equations as you go along as compared with getting them from Newton or somebody like that.\nSteeped in acoustics as he was, Rayleigh does say: \"A partial escape from these difficulties might be found in regarding the actual spectrum lines as due to difference tones from primaries of much higher pitch.\" That is a well-known device that gives physicists license to pass from a square term to a linear term. That is to say, a small change in the square is linear.\nThere is still something else in the 1906 paper which intrigues me. Rayleigh devotes a paragraph to the problem of the sharpness of spectral lines despite the random character of the conditions of excitation and concludes with a paragraph that sounds very modern. I will quote that:\nIt is possible, however, that the conditions of stability or of exemption from radiation may, after all, demand this definiteness, notwithstanding that in the comparatively simple cases treated by Thomson, the angular velocity is open to variation. According to this view, the frequencies observed in the spectrum may not be frequencies of disturbance or of oscillation in the ordinary sense at all, but rather form an essential part of the original constitution of the atom as determined by conditions of stability.\nMaybe one reads into that one's present knowledge of the later developments of quantum theory, but I found that very interesting as a foreshadowing of the way we look at it now.\nEven as late as 1911 we find Lord Rayleigh worrying about Kelvin's cloud 2, the specific heat difficulty, although Einstein had really put that difficulty away in 1907. In 1911 Rayleigh wrote to Walter Nernst to express his concern:\nIf we begin by supposing an elastic body to be rather stiff, the vibrations have their full share of kinetic energy [that is the equipartition law] and this share cannot be diminished by increasing the stiffness\u0085.\nWe all know that increasing the stiffness makes the interval between the vibration quantum levels greater, so that they do not take part practically in the equipartition law simply because they cannot get enough energy to be even excited to the first state.\nHowever, Rayleigh goes on:\nPerhaps this failure might be invoked in support of the views of Planck and his school that the laws of dynamics as hitherto understood cannot be applied to the smallest parts of the bodies. But I must confess that I do not like this solution of the puzzle . . . I have a difficulty in accepting it as a picture of what actually takes place.\nWe do well I think to concentrate attention on the diatomic gaseous molecule. Under the influence of collisions the molecule freely and rapidly acquires rotation. [He knows this from the specific heat.] Why does it not also acquire vibration along the line joining the two atoms?\nIf I rightly understand, the answer of Planck is that in consideration of the stiffness of the union, the amount of energy that should be acquired at each collision falls below the minimum possible and that therefore none at all is acquired [this is of course exactly what we know] an argument which certainly sounds paradoxical.\nThis is the end of it for Rayleigh.\nSo we can see that the acceptance of these ideas was something that came very, very slowly. The examples I have chosen illustrate that very little was stated about the subject at all from 1900 to 1905, and even after that you find the great men of the period hesitant and unwilling to build it into their thinking.\nLet us now turn to Einstein's famous 1905 paper, which I must confess I had not read until I got to thinking over the preparation for this lecture. It is one of the papers we all hear about in school and worship, but do not read. One of the odd things about this paper is that \"h\" is not in it, believe it or not. In the paper Einstein denotes by the letter b what we now would call h/k, and then he writes R/N for what we call k, and thus you find in that paper that the energy of a light quantum is not hn at all. It is Rbn/N, which certainly takes a bit of getting used to.\nThe title of his paper is an interesting one: \"Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Emission and Transformation of Light,\" indicating I think that he meant that there is something in the paper, but he does not quite know what. At least that is what I mean when I say \"heuristic.\" Einstein might, of course, have meant something else. He says:\nThe energy of a ponderable body cannot be divided into indefinitely many indefinitely small parts, whereas the energy emitted by a point light source is regarded on the Maxwell theory or more generally according to every wave theory as continuously spread over a continuously increasing volume.\nSuch wave theories of light have given a good representation of purely optical phenomena and will surely not be replaced by any other theory. [He was right in that. They have not been replaced.]\nHe Continues:\nIt is to be remembered, however, that the optical observations referred to time mean values, not to instantaneous values, and it is quite conceivable that, in spite of complete success in dealing with diffraction, reflection, refraction, dispersion, et cetera, such a theory of continuous fields could lead to contradictions with experience when applied to phenomena of light emission and absorption.\nAfter a little more discussion he makes the key declaration which played such a decisive role in all subsequent developments in which in one sentence he says:\nAccording to the supposition here considered, the energy in the light propagated from rays from a point is not smeared out continuously over larger and larger volumes, but rather consists of a finite number of energy quanta localized at space points, which move without breaking up and which can be absorbed or emitted only as wholes.\nOddly enough, though everybody quotes this paper purely for the photoelectric effect in the discussion nowadays, the photoelectric effect is only one section, paragraph 8, of the whole paper. The first six paragraphs are concerned entirely with another way of looking at the details of the statistical distribution of the black-body radiation law, and the entropy of radiation along the lines of the quantized wave theory.\nFinally paragraph 7 is an interpretation of the Stokes' rules for photoluminescence. In ordinary fluorescence and phosphorescence, Stokes' law, which goes way back to 1860, says that the wavelength of the fluorescent light is always greater than the wavelength of the exciting light, or nearly so. There is some radiation, that is called anti-Stokes radiation, for which the wavelength is a little shorter.\nThat puzzled me, why so little stress in Einstein's paper on the photoelectric effect compared with these other things. Then comes section 8 which deals with the photoelectric effect. So I asked Professor A. L. Hughes, one of the pioneers of photoelectric work, who is at our place\u0097he is emeritus professor in Washington University in St. Louis\u0097how that could be. He told me how very primitive the knowledge of photoelectric effect was at that time. No vacuum work on photoelectricity had been done, and even that which had been done was done with very poor vacuums, under very poor conditions. In point of fact no effort to find out the retarding potential required to stop the photocurrent in a definite circuit had been made.\nWhat had been observed was that if you insulate a metal object and shine light on it, it will build up to a certain potential and then stay at that potential. That is, it builds up its own retarding potential and finally prevents the escape of further electrons just out in the air. Different metals differed in regard to what potential would be built up by certain light, and it was found that as one went to more and more violet light one got a higher potential. But there were only very crude measurements indeed, so crude that one would hardly think that there was any possibility of a fundamental understanding being involved there.\nThat perhaps is the reason why the photoelectric effect was so little stressed in that paper. The Stokes' law argument was a much more direct experimental one and, conversely, it seems rather odd to me as I think about it, that Stokes' law is not more stressed today in teaching the subject.\nIt was in 1907 that the specific heat work of Einstein clarified the problem of low-temperature specific heat.\nIt is fascinating to look up some of the historical information that is available in the literature. I do not mean that one has to go to ancient history, just the history of the last century. For example, in 1904, when the great St. Louis World's Fair was held, various distinguished visitors were giving lectures. Lord Kelvin gave a speech there that was rather suggestive of a sort of inverse neutrino theory. The thing that was bothering him at that time was\u0097this is a little off the subject of quantum theory, but I think it is interesting\u0097the measurement just made by the Curies of the amount of energy being given off by radium per unit time. They had not measured the half life and the energy given off did not show any signs of weakening, and you know that physicists are great on extrapolation. They said that radium gives off energy perpetually\u0097that was the word, perpetually.\nSo the question was, how could anything radiate perpetually at this tremendous rate, unheard of when expressed in terms of energies of usual chemical reactions.\nKelvin had an idea which he propounded at this talk, that perhaps there was some kind of energy that we were not able to detect\u0097like the neutrinos\u0097that was floating around in space, and that radium had the property of absorbing it in that form and then reconverting it, like a fountain, and shooting it out, and that is what we observe. Even in those days people were perfectly willing to balance the books on conservation of energy in ways like that.\nThe next major historical event was the development of the Bohr atom model in 1913.\nAt this point, since we are just talking a little bit of anecdotal material about the history of our subject, I will tell a story that I learned from George Gamow. The young Bohr\u0097he was about 26 at that time\u0097came to England from Copenhagen to work in the Cavendish Laboratory. The great J. J. Thomson was at the height of his powers. Bohr came to the great center to study fundamental atomic physics; but within a few months he left the Cavendish Laboratory and went up to Manchester to work under a relatively unknown fellow named Rutherford. The question is why did he do that? According to Gamow, Bohr had gotten into trouble with \"J. J.\" because he was a little critical of the Thomson atom model, and \"J. J.\" had politely indicated to him that it might be nice if he left Cambridge and went to work with Rutherford. That is how Bohr went to work for Rutherford, which was advantageous, I think, for all. It was not so good for the Thomson model but it was fine for the future development of physics.\nTo bring this story up to date, Gamow told me that in 1928, when he worked on the alpha particle tunneling paper, the basic work which Gurney and I did simultaneously in Princeton, Rutherford sent Gamow to see Bohr and to tell him about this exciting new development. He also wrote him a letter\u0097which Gamow said he still has a copy of\u0097saying, \"Please pay attention to this fellow; there is something in it. It isn't cockeyed. You remember how it was with you when you went to 'J. J.' and he wouldn't listen; so now you listen to Gamow.\" I do not know whether there is any truth in that or not, but at any rate Bohr did listen to Gamow.\nOf course, the most exciting immediate experimental consequence of Bohr's work was, besides the direct interpretation of the spectrum of hydrogen that was well known at that time\u0097I mean the facts of the Balmer series, which went way back into the 19th century\u0097was the interpretation of spectroscopic term values as being energy levels with the associated implication that controlled electron impact would produce controlled excitation of atoms and molecules. This was the work that was immediately followed up by James Franck and Gustav Hertz, and for which they received the Nobel prize in physics in 1926.\nThat work was very quickly taken up here in Washington, in the pioneer work of Paul Foote and F. L. Mohler. At the National Bureau of Standards the accountants were rather stuffy, and had rather sharp lines about appropriations and budgets, so that all the work on critical potentials for which the Bureau of Standards became famous was carried on under a budget number which had something to do with improving pyrometric methods. I am not quite sure whether this work helped much pyrometry but it certainly was a great addition to the development of fundamental science.\nThe period of the second decade of our subject was also characterized by the very first extension of the idea of quantized energy levels to the interpretation of band spectra, rotation and vibration spectra, and infrared.\nA curious thing about the atom model work of Bohr, prior to 1923 or 1924, was that if you look at the current papers you get the impression that everybody in the world was terrifically excited about the Bohr model and believed in it hook, line, and sinker, including the atom orbits as they are used in the ads for the atomic age nowadays. Bohr on the other hand was constantly making remarks, speeches, and admonitions to the effect that this is temporary and we ought to be looking for a way to do it right.\nThe great breakthrough, as the saying goes nowadays, came about 1924,1925, and 1926, when the idea of waves of accompanying electrons was first published by Prince Louis de Broglie as a doctor's thesis, and was again ignored. I do know anybody who read that paper until a year or two later. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger then founded the great discoveries of wave mechanics on de Broglie's work which were published in the spring of 1926 in a series of papers in the Annalen der Physik.\nJust before Schr\u00f6dinger's work in late 1925, Born, Jordan, and Heisenberg had developed the matrix mechanics methods. For about a year they were thought of as two rival and distinct theories, until Schr\u00f6dinger and Carl Eckart, a young physicist in Chicago, who is now in La Jolla, recognized the mathematical identity of the two theories.\nI had the good fortune to get my doctorate in the summer of 1926 when all these things were at their highest peak of excitement, and went to G\u00f6ttingen to work with Born. There was a young graduate student there named Robert Oppenheimer whom I got acquainted with at that time.\nThis was an extremely difficult period because the rate of advance was so great, and the whole subject was so obscure to all of us that it was an extremely difficult thing to keep up with matters. I remember that that fall David Hilbert was lecturing on quantum theory, although he was in very poor health at the time. He had anemia, and liver extract was not available at that time and he was eating a vast quantity of liver every day and saying he would rather not live than eat that much liver. His life was saved by the fact that the liver extract was discovered just about that time. But that is not the point of my story. What I was going to say is that Hilbert was having a great laugh on Born and Heisenberg and the G\u00f6ttingen theoretical physicists because when they first discovered matrix mechanics they were having, of course, the same kind of trouble that everybody else had trying to solve problems and manipulate and really do things with matrices. So they went to Hilbert for help, and Hilbert said the only times that he had ever had anything to do with matrices was when they came up as a sort of by-product of the eigenvalues of the boundary value problem of a differential equation. So if you look for the differential equation which has these matrices you can probably do more with that. They thought that was a goofy idea, and that Hilbert did not know what he was talking about. So he was having a lot of fun pointing out to them that they could have found out Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanics six months earlier if they had paid a little more attention to him.\nI mention some of the things that were occurring during those years because I do not believe that anybody who did not live through that period has quite an appreciation of what a tremendous number of new discoveries were made at that time that are still of fundamental importance, and have blossomed out into whole new areas of physics that are subjects for courses in themselves.\nIn 1926 we had the whole wave mechanics as we know it, and the whole matrix mechanics formulated. And just a little before that, we had the discovery of the electron spin and of the Pauli exclusion principle. In 1927 came the whole theory of the chemical valence bond as a perturbation problem in quantum mechanics with correlations over electron pairs with their spins antiparallel. Then came almost simultaneously with that the whole development of Fermi-Dirac statistics and its clarification of the problems of metal theory. A few months after that, came the Dirac papers on the quantization of the electromagnetic field which explained at last the difference between spontaneous and induced emission and put the two together in a unified theory. Soon after that came the whole Dirac relativistic theory of the electron which later led to the prediction of the positron.\nIt was a little after that, in 1928, that the interpretation of natural alpha radioactivity came as a consequence of the barrier leakage idea, also an essential element of quantum mechanics and an essential element of its statistical or probability interpretation. I think it is fair to say that the barrier leakage idea was the opening of the modern period of the application of quantum mechanics to nuclear physics. Nuclear physics, in terms of real specific models, has never had a classical past. Nobody tried in those days to develop specific models of the structure of a nucleus.\nAnother big year for discoveries was 1932, the year in which heavy hydrogen was discovered, which from a nuclear point of view means the deuteron, the year in which the first production of an artificial nuclear reaction was accomplished by Cockcroft and Walton, and the year in which the positron was discovered, the antiparticle associated with the electron, as we call it nowadays.\nIn that same decade, a few years later, 1936 saw the development of the Fermi theory of beta decay based on the neutrino hypothesis that had been introduced by Pauli, in almost a joking way, a year or two earlier.\nI remember in the summer of 1937 when we had a conference on beta decay theory at Cornell University, and a lot of us were having trouble worrying about it, Fermi was in the audience sitting in the back row just smiling and smiling as he usually did. People tried to get him to comment, and he said, \"I have always been surprised that people take that theory so seriously.\" But, of course, as we know, it has turned out to be remarkably correct; that is, the basic formalism which Fermi developed then for accounting for the four-fermion interactions, even in spite of the great crisis it went through in 1957 with the discovery of nonconservation of parity. The basic formalism, as Fermi first introduced it, has beautifully stood the test of time.\nOf course in the year 1936 you have work which is important to us here because it was done by prominent people in Washington. I refer to the work of Hafstad, Heidenberg, and Tuve in the first real studies of proton-proton scattering, which gave direct evidence of forces between protons other than the Coulomb forces, that is, short-range nuclear forces between protons. The theoretical interpretations of those results was largely done by Gregory Breit and myself up in Princeton, associated with Richard Present, who is now at the University of Tennessee. That gave the first evidence that we had of what is now called the charge independence of nuclear forces, because the additional short-range force that was revealed in this way turned out quantitatively to be very closely the same as the force between a proton and a neutron that is revealed in the normal state of the deuteron.\nFrom about 1932 on we have the whole field of nuclear physics coming into being in a big way with deuterons available, with machines available, both cyclotrons and Van de Graaf machines. In the latter part of that decade we began to have the first theories of Bethe and Marshak on the application of specific models of nuclear reactions to finding satisfactory sources of stellar energy.\nI think perhaps I must give up at this point, because the last two decades have seen such an overwhelmingly rapid and vast amount of progress, spreading out into a great many different fields, that one could not possibly in the short time remaining do more than just mention it.\nWe had, in the decade from 1940 to 1950, the whole development of the modern point of view on quantum electrodynamics. It came rather late in the decade, with the discovery of the Lamb shift and the experimental confirmation of the abnormal magnetic moment of the electron, the fact that it was somewhat off from the original Dirac theory. We had at last the clarification of the puzzling features of the mesons in cosmic rays whereby it turned out that there were the two kinds, the pi mesons and the mu mesons, the pi mesons decaying into the mu mesons. The latter part of the decade represented the beginning of public knowledge of fission, and the engineering and political uses of fission.\nAt the same time, going off in quite another direction, what has turned out to be of equal importance has been the whole wide development of the application of Fermi statistics to electrons in solids, first resulting in the major classification of properties of metals, then of semiconductors, and then finally of really modern tailored effects that led to devices such as transistors and so on.\nThe decade just passed has corresponded to an enormous further development along these same lines. We have the study of nuclear reactions going on up to higher energies of some hundreds of millions of volts, with predominant interest in the study of polarization effects in nuclear reactions as another way of getting at points of detail; the recognition of the nonconservation of parity; the experimental discovery of the neutrino; the recognition that the Fermi interaction that applies in weak interactions is more general than simply the beta decay and also applies to muon decay and other related processes; and the discovery of the strange particles.\nAnd then finally, as a roundup of mentioning things that we do not have time to talk about, the extraordinarily fine extensions that have been made in the last five years of the theory of broad, modern, good perturbation theory methods for dealing with the many-body problem. That involved not only the better calculation of nuclear models but also, at last, after many years of effort, is beginning to provide a real understanding of superfluids.\nIn conclusion I should like to emphasize again that all this scientific activity started almost exactly sixty years ago\u0097barring two weeks\u0097on December 14, 1900, when Planck's constant was first introduced into physics. In the sixty years that have intervened it is now almost impossible to find many papers in physics which do not deal directly or indirectly with phenomena that are fully and basically conditioned by the existence of that one universal constant.\n"}, {"score": 2497.202, "uuid": "d59935dc-7305-5ca1-85b8-b365093f9031", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1012wb-50-10827", "target_hostname": "www.numericana.com", "target_uri": "http://www.numericana.com/answer/quantum.htm", "page_rank": 1.3358249e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "<em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>: Matrix <em>Mechanics</em> <em>and</em> Wave <em>Mechanics</em> - Numericana", "snippet": "Surprisingly enough, when <em>the</em> logical components of an event are only imperfectly observed (with some remaining uncertainty), <em>the</em> probability of <em>the</em> outcome <em>is</em> somewhere <em>between</em> <em>what</em> <em>the</em> <em>quantum</em> rules say <em>and</em> <em>what</em> <em>the</em> classical rules would predict.", "explanation": null, "document": "(\u00a0voice-over by Nancy Thorndike Greenspan, biographer of Max Born\u00a0)\nQuantum Physics\n(2002-11-01) The Quantum Substitute for Logic\nHow is the probability of an outcome computed in quantum theory?\nIf you're not completely confused by quantum\nmechanics, you do not understand it.\nJohn Archibald Wheeler (1911- 2008 )\nFirst, let's consider how probabilities are ordinarily computed:\u00a0 When an event consists of two mutually exclusive events, its probability is the sum of the probabilities of those two events.\u00a0 Similarly, when an event is the conjunction of\u00a0two statistically independent events, its probability is the product of the probabilities of those two events.\nFor example, if you roll a fair die, the probability of obtaining a multiple of 3 is 1/3\u00a0=\u00a01/6+1/6; it's the sum of the probabilities (1/6 each) of the two mutually exclusive events \"3\" and \"6\".\u00a0 You add probabilities when the component events can't happen together (the outcome of the roll cannot be both \"3\" and \"6\").\nOn\u00a0the other hand, the probability of rolling two fair dice without obtaining a\u00a06 is\u00a0\u00a025/36\u00a0=\u00a0(5/6)(5/6); it's the product of the probabilities (5/6\u00a0each) of two independent events, each consisting of not rolling a\u00a06 with each throw.\nQuantum Logic and [Complex] Probability Amplitudes :\nIn the quantum realm, as long as two logical possibilities are not actually observed, they can be neither exclusive nor independent and the above does not apply.\u00a0 Instead, quantum mechanical probability amplitudes are defined as complex numbers whose absolute values squared correspond to ordinary probabilities.\u00a0 The phases (the angular directions)\u00a0 of such complex numbers have no classical equivalents\u00a0 (although they happen to provide a deep explanation for the existence of the conserved classical quantity known as electric charge).\nTo obtain the amplitude of an event with two unobserved logical components:\nFor EITHER-OR (exclusive) components, the amplitudes are added.\nFor AND (independent) components, the amplitudes are multiplied.\nIn practice, \"AND components\" are successive steps that could logically lead to the desired outcome, forming what's called an acceptable history for that outcome.\u00a0 The \"EITHER-OR components\", whose amplitudes are to be added, are thus all the possible histories logically leading up to the same outcome.\u00a0 Following Richard Feynman , the whole thing is therefore called a \"sum\u00a0over histories\".\nThese algebraic manipulations are a mind-boggling substitute for statistical logic, but that's the way the physical universe appears to work.\u00a0 The above quantum logic normally applies only at the\u00a0microscopic level, where \"observation\" of individual components is either impossible or would introduce an unacceptable disturbance.\u00a0 At the macroscopic level, the observation of a combined outcome usually implies that all relevant components are somehow \"observed\" as well (and the ordinary algebra of probabilities applies).\u00a0 For example, in our examples involving dice, you cannot tell if the outcome of a throw is a multiple of 3 unless you actually observe the precise outcome and will thus know if it's a \"3\" or\u00a0a\u00a0\"6\", or something else.\u00a0 Similarly, to\u00a0know that you haven't obtained a\u00a0\"6\" in\u00a0a double throw, you must observe separately the outcome of each throw.\u00a0 Surprisingly enough, when the logical components of an event are only imperfectly observed (with some remaining uncertainty), the probability of the outcome is somewhere between what the quantum rules say and what the classical rules would predict.\n(2007-07-19) On the \"Statistics\" of Elementary Particles\nA direct consequence of quantum logic: Pauli's Exclusion Principle\nIn very general terms, you may call \"particle\" some part of a quantum system. Swapping (or switching) a pair of particles is making one particle take the place of\u00a0the other and vice versa, while leaving everything else unchanged.\u00a0 Although swapping particles may deeply affect a quantum system, swapping twice will certainly not change anything since, by definition, this is like doing nothing at all.\n\"Swapping\" can be defined as something that does nothing if you do it twice.\u00a0 Particles are defined to be \"identical\" if they can be swapped.\nSo, according to the above quantum logic, the amplitude associated with one swapping must have a square of\u00a01.\u00a0 Therefore (assuming that amplitudes are ordinary complex numbers ) the swapping amplitude is either +1 or -1.\nIn the mathematical description of quantum states, swapping is well-defined only for particles of the same \"nature\".\u00a0 Whether swapping involves a\u00a0multiplicative factor of +1 or -1 depends on that \"nature\".\u00a0 Particles for which swapping leaves the quantum state unchanged are called bosons, those for which swapping negates the quantum state are called fermions.\nA deep consequence of Special relativity is that spin determines which \"statistics\" a given type of particles obeys\u00a0 (Bose-Eintein statistics for bosons, Fermi-Dirac statistics for fermion).\u00a0 Part of the angular momentum of a fermion cannot be explained in classical terms\u00a0 (it must include a nonorbital \"pointlike\" component).\u00a0 The spin of a boson is a whole multiple of the quantum of angular momentum h/2p,\u00a0 whereas the spin of a fermion is an odd multiple of the \"half quantum\" h/4p.\nWith the concepts so defined, let's consider a quantum state where two fermions would be absolutely undistinguishable.\u00a0 Not only would they be particles of the same kind (e.g., two electrons) but they would have the same position, the same state of motion, etc.\u00a0 So, the quantum state is clearly unchanged by swapping.\u00a0 Yet, swapping fermions must negate the quantum state...\u00a0 Therefore, it's equal to its own opposite and can only be zero\u00a0!\u00a0 The probability associated to a zero quantum state is zero; this corresponds to something impossible.\u00a0 In other words, two different fermions can't \"occupy\" the exact same state.\nThis result is called Pauli's exclusion principle.\u00a0 It's the reason why all the electrons around a nucleus don't collapse to the single state of lowest energy.\u00a0 Instead, they occupy successively different \"orbitals\", according to rules which explain the entire periodic table of chemical elements .\n(2002-11-01) The Infamous Measurement Problem\nWhat does a quantum observation entail?\nThere are no things, only processes.\nDavid Bohm\u00a0 (1917- 1992 )\nThis is arguably the most fundamental unsolved question in quantum mechanics.\nAccording to the above , one should deal strictly with amplitudes between observations (or measurements), but another recipe holds when measurements are made.\u00a0 That would be fine if we knew exactly what a measurement entails, but we don't...\u00a0 Should we really assume that a system can only be measured by some outside agency (the observer)?\u00a0 If we do, nothing prevents us from considering a larger system that includes this observer as well, and that system's evolution would involve only measurement-free quantum rules.\u00a0 If we don't assume that, we can't avoid the conclusion that a system can observe itself, in some obscure sense.\u00a0 Either way, the simple quantum rules outlined above would have to be smoothly modified to account for a behavior which can be nearly classical for a large enough system.\u00a0 In other words, current quantum ideas must be incomplete, because they fail to describe any bridge between a quantum system waiting only to be observed, and an entity capable of observation.\nOur current quantum description of the world has proven its worth and reigns supreme, just like Newtonian mechanics reigned supreme before the advent of Relativity Theory . Relativity consistently bridged the gap between the slow and the fast, the massive and the massless (while retaining the full applicability of Newtonian theories to the domain of ordinary speeds).\u00a0 Likewise, the gap must ultimately be bridged between observer and observed, between the large and the small, between the classical world and the quantum realm, for there is but one single physical reality in which everything is immersed...\nThis bothers, or should bother, everybody who deals with quantum mechanics:\u00a0 The so-called Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat theme is often used to discuss the problem, in the guise of a system that includes a cat (a \"qualified\" observer) in the presence of a quantum device which could trigger a lethal device.\u00a0 It\u00a0seems silly to view the whole thing as a single quantum system, which would only exist (until observed) in\u00a0some superposition of states, where the cat would be neither dead nor alive, but both at once.\u00a0 Something must exist which collapses the quantum state of a large enough system frequently enough to make it appear \"classical\".\u00a0 It stands to reason that Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat must be dead very shortly after being killed...\u00a0 Doesn't\u00a0it?\n(2005-07-03) Matrix Mechanics\u00a0 (1925)\nPhysical quantities are multiplied like matrices ...\u00a0 Order matters.\nIn 1925, Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976; Nobel 1932 ) discovered that observable physical quantities obey noncommutative rules similar to those governing the multiplication of algebraic matrices.\nIf the measurement of a physical quantity would disturb the measurement of the other, then a noncommutative circumstance exists which disallows even the possibility of two separate sets of experiments yielding the values of these two quantities with arbitrary precision\u00a0 (read this again).\u00a0 This delicate connection between noncommutativity and uncertainty is now known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.\u00a0 In particular, the position and momentum of a particle can only be measured with respective uncertainties\u00a0 (i.e., standard deviations in repeated experiments) Dx\u00a0 and Dpx satisfying the following inequality\u00a0:\nDx Dpx \u00b3 h/4p [where\u00a0 h\u00a0 is Planck's constant ]\nThe early development of Heisenberg's Matrix Mechanics was undertaken by M.\u00a0Born and P.\u00a0Jordan.\nIn March 1926, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger showed that Heisenberg's viewpoint was equivalent to his own \"undulatory\" approach\u00a0 (Wave Mechanics, January 1926)\u00a0 for which he would share the 1933 Nobel prize with Paul Dirac , who gave basic Quantum Theory its current form .\nHeisenberg's Viewpoint\u00a0 [skip on first reading]\nHere is a terse summary of Heisenberg's approach in terms of the Schr\u00f6dinger viewpoint which we adopt here, following Dirac and almost all modern scholars:\nIn the modern Schr\u00f6dinger-Dirac perspective, a ket |y>\u00a0 is introduced which describes a quantum state varying with time.\u00a0 Since it remains of unit length, its value at time t is obtained from its value at time 0 via a unitary operator \u00db.\n| yt > \u00a0 = \u00db (t,0)\u00a0 | y0 >\nThe unitary operator \u00db so defined is called the evolution operator.\nHeisenberg's viewpoint consists in considering that a given system is represented by the constant ket \u00db*\u00a0|y>.\u00a0 Operators are modified accordingly...\nA physical quantity which is associated with the operator \u00c2 in the Schr\u00f6dinger viewpoint (possibly constant with time)\u00a0 is then associated with the following time-dependent operator in the Heisenberg viewpoint.\n\u00db* \u00c2\u00a0 \u00db = \u00db-1 (t,0) \u00c2\u00a0 \u00db (t,0)\n(2002-11-02) The Schr\u00f6dinger Equation\u00a0 (1926)\nThe dance of a single nonrelativistic particle in a classical force field.\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation governs the probability amplitude y of a particle of\u00a0mass\u00a0 m\u00a0 and energy\u00a0 E\u00a0 in a space-dependent potential energy\u00a0 V.\nStrictly speaking,\u00a0 E\u00a0 is the total relativistic mechanical energy\u00a0 (starting at\u00a0 mc2 for\u00a0the particle at rest).\u00a0 However, the final stationary Schr\u00f6dinger equation ( below )\u00a0 features only the difference\u00a0 E-V\u00a0 with respect to the potential\u00a0 V,\u00a0 which may thus be shifted to incorporate the rest energy of a single particle.\nFor several particles, the issue cannot be skirted so easily\u00a0 (in fact, it's partially unresolved)\u00a0 and it's one of several reasons why the quantum study of multiple particles takes the form of an inherently relativistic theory\u00a0 (Quantum Field Theory, which also accounts for the creation and anihilation of particles).\nIn 1926, when the Austrian physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger (1887-1961; Nobel 1933 ) worked out the equation now named after him, he thought that the quantity y which appears in it was somehow related to a density of electric charge...\nInstead, y is now understood to be a probability amplitude,\u00a0 as defined in the above article , namely a complex number whose squared length is proportional to the probability of actually finding the electron at a particular position in space.\u00a0 That\u00a0interpretation of y was proposed by Max Born (1882-1970; Nobel 1954 )\u00a0 the very person who actually coined the term quantum mechanics (Max Born also happens to be the maternal grandfather of Olivia Newton-John ).\nThe controversy about the meaning of y hindered neither the early development of Schr\u00f6dinger's theory of \"Wave Mechanics\", nor the derivation of the nonrelativistic equation at its core:\nA Derivation of Schr\u00f6dinger's Equation :\nWe may start with the expression of the phase-speed, or celerity u = E/p \u00a0 of\u00a0a matter wave, which comes directly from de Broglie's principle , or less directly from other more\u00a0complicated analogies between particles and waves.\nThe nonrelativistic (defining) relations\u00a0 E = V + \u00bd mv 2 and \u00a0 p = mv \u00a0 imply:\np \u00a0 = \u00d6\nTherefore, the wave celerity\u00a0 u = E/p\u00a0 is simply:\nu \u00a0 = \u00a0 E \u00a0/ \u00d6\nNow, the general 3-dimensional wave equation of some quantity j propagating at celerity\u00a0 u\u00a0 is:\n1\n"}], [{"score": 2491.811, "uuid": "6d902f6d-9221-5140-9a8a-8171750d73b3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0302wb-97-14405", "target_hostname": "www.theisticscience.org", "target_uri": "http://www.theisticscience.org/talks/qps1/", "page_rank": 1.3054833e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Are <em>QUANTUM</em> <em>PHYSICS</em> <em>and</em> SPIRITUALITY related?", "snippet": "That <em>is</em> one of <em>the</em> <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> classical <em>and</em> <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em>, because there are tendencies <em>and</em> not just hard <em>and</em> fast limits.", "explanation": null, "document": "E.H. Walker 6\nFigure 1: Suggested means for getting one definite actuality\nThose of you that have read some popular physics will recognise some of these alternatives, and they are all designed to answer the same measurement problem. The first suggestion is called Everett\u0092s many-worlds interpretation, in which there is not any real selection, but all alternatives occur the same time, for example in some set of parallel universes. The second theory of \u0091decoherence\u0092 says that it really like that, but that it appears to a good approximation as if only one outcome occurs. Niels Bohr thought it was the fact that experimental apparatus was \u0091classical\u0092, with no wave behaviour, that gives rise to a particular outcome. We now know that quantum physics applies to the experimental apparatus as well, so that does not really solve the problem. Werner Heisenberg, Eugene Wigner and Henry Stapp have in turn introduced the speculation that selection is something to do with consciousness or mind, and this has given rise to a whole stream of suggestions in which consciousness (or something) has become more and more involved in trying to solve the problem of quantum physics.\nWigner in a paper of 40 years ago suggested that it was the consciousness of the observing scientist, and this idea has been carried on by Stapp, who says that consciousness is actually involved in the brain. Stapp believes that since a quantum brain has many alternate things that can happen, consciousness selects one of these outcomes to produce a result. I have listed other alternatives here, which get progressively more \u0091way out\u0092. A few of these ideas we can imagine being true, for example that \u0091spirit produces nature\u0092, but some people have gone even further than that, and have said that nature is somehow essentially spiritual \u0096 that it is connected with, or equal to, the spiritual. Others have continued this theme to say that quantum physics is a way of learning about spirituality, a way to regain our spirituality. There is a great range of possible solutions here that try to solve the same problem: how something that is described by a wave can produce a definite outcome. The trouble starts from the fact that when physicists think about nature, they only have two ideas in mind: they can think of a wave or a particle 7 . The difficulty is that the objects which quantum physics tells us are in nature are not just waves, and not just particles, so the challenge is to find a new understanding and a new picture.\nAs well as the more extreme ideas above, there are further ideas that have been proposed. James Jeans, the mathematical physicist, wrote 8 about 60 years ago that \u0093the wave function looks like not something solid and substantial, but looks more like an \u0091idea\u0092\u0094. Some (e.g. Zohar 9 ) have taken this to mean that quantum physics tells us about ideas. Others, discussing the putative identity of spirit and nature, have tried to work out various ways for why they appear to be different. They have said that perhaps spirit and nature are different grades of energies, different frequencies, different dimensions, and/or different \u0091fineness\u0092 of material. Those of us with backgrounds from Swedenborg will recognise that suggesting \u0091different dimensions\u0092 here is trying to use spatial analogies (thinking from ideas of space) to distinguish mind from nature. When people try to talk about \u0091different frequencies\u0092, they are using temporal analogies to think about this difference. But we know from Swedenborg that we cannot really use either of these kinds of analogies (TCR 30).\nFrom Swedenborg we think we know which of all the above ideas make sense, that is, which of them could possibly be true. Let us point out which ones these might be, before discussing which ones are true. We know that choosing to do one particular thing cannot be just an illusion, because otherwise it would make a mockery of trying to order one\u0092s life. We know that particular outcomes are chosen, so that it cannot really just be a good approximation that selections do occur. We know that consciousness is perhaps involved. It is not ruled out, because we know from Swedenborg that spirit produces nature, and it may be that consciousness, as part of spirit, is involved. But we know that the last three ideas (9-11) cannot be true, because we know that there is an essential difference between nature and spirit, which means that we have to find a different kind of connection between quantum physics and spirituality, that is not just identity. There must be another kind of connection. Of the next set of ideas, we know that distinctions based on time or dimensions cannot be true. We know that the true distinction is not based on \u0091fineness\u0092 or \u0091subtlety\u0092: Swedenborg has comments to make about that (HH 38, TCR 280). It may be true that the wave function looks like an idea, but that is only true if we take the word \u0091like\u0092 to refer to correspondence rather than to be just equal.\nMultiple Levels\nAll of the above is a very brief and necessarily cursory introduction to how we can use Swedenborg to understand modern physics. I am going to discuss the existence of \u0091multiple generative levels\u0092 or \u0091discrete levels\u0092. Swedenborg makes a great effort to distinguish discrete from continuous levels (HH 38, DLW 184ff), and what I want to show is that there are discrete levels within the natural, that is, within quantum physics. This will help us to understand what is going on in physics. Furthermore, these discrete levels within the natural will correspond to other discrete levels we know about within spiritual processes. Thus, we have this triadic structure within the natural, as well as within the spiritual, and these are linked together by correspondences. This is the overall theme for what follows.\nIf we recapitulate what Swedenborg tells us about how spirit and nature are combined, and if we look at what Swedenborg said after he was told what was actually happening rather than what he tried to guess at in his earlier years, which is quite different, then we see that he later in his life learned that the spirit is an essential means in the creation of nature. Nature is not created immediately from the Infinite, but is created by means of the spirit. He came to see that the natural world is a final effect of causes working in the spiritual world, which themselves manifest certain forms of love. So, as a consequence, this pattern of love > wisdom > effect is the pattern that we can try to use to understand what is happening in quantum physics.\nThis pattern can be summarised in many ways: love > wisdom > effect; or soul > mind > body, as the same triadic pattern. Swedenborg gives us ample reason to show that this is repeated in the soul: we have celestial, spiritual and spiritual-natural. It is repeated in the mind: we have an interior rational, an exterior natural, and a sensory mind. So the question is, it is also repeated in the natural world?\nSwedenborg has a variety of things to say about degrees in the natural world (see e.g Hugo Lj. Odhner\u0092s article 10 ). When Swedenborg started, he had quite a few different ideas that varied from book to book. I am going to talk about his \u0091ethers\u0092, which is something about which he changed his mind a number of times, also concerning how they are related to the spiritual world 11 . If we read from Last Judgement (Posthumous),\n\u0093the three natural atmospheres arising from the sun of the world are the purer ether, which is universal, from which is all gravitation; the middle ether, which forms the vortex around the planets, in which are the moons and the satellites, from which is magnetism; and the ultimate ether which is the air.\u0094 (LJP 320)\nThis is where he talks about three degrees in nature. These days, we don\u0092t believe in \u0091ether\u0092, but the question is whether we can interpret what he says about purer, middle, and ultimate ethers in such a way that makes sense. I am going to assume that these three adjectives refer to different kinds of ethers. He might not have known from the scientific point of view what they were, but they certainly appear to be three different things, and certainly not three different vacuums 12 . But do we recognise this pattern? Does it make sense to us? We have to allow some flexibility in the interpretation of what he meant by ether, but he does tell us what are the functions of these three ethers. He tells us that the first one is to do with gravity, the middle one is to do with magnetism, and the final one is to do with material things. Do those descriptions make sense?\nLet us try and work out what three degrees in the natural might be, if we use New Church principles to work out a priori what those degrees might be expected to consist of. From the correspondences of the natural with the three degrees in the spiritual, then in the natural there must be (a) a way of receiving in the body the intentions of the spirit, furthermore there must be (b) a propagation of causes within the natural, and there must be (c) a way of producing effects in the natural. We can think of these as ends, cause, and effects, all in the natural. This is what we expect to see from Swedenborg\u0092s point of view. Is there a way of looking at the natural that we know about from science, in which we see these three degrees?\nIn modern physics we do not know anything about ends; in fact we deliberately refuse to consider ends in physics, as a rule. But we know a great deal about the propagation of causes in physics: that is what physics does extremely well. It tells us how causes propagate through sequences and the various changes produced. And in physics we know some little about effects. In fact, the irony is that the whole business I talked about earlier, of getting a definite outcome in quantum physics, is precisely because physics does not know enough about the actual effects. So it is clear that contemporary physics knows a lot about propagation of causes, and it knows almost everything about the production of effects, though there is still something missing from what quantum physics tells about the final effects. Thus, if Swedenborg has any light to cast on what these three degrees are, it should help fill in an important lacuna, a noticeable gap in quantum physics, which is the production of effects.\nEnergy\nIf we look at physics, and at what physics regards as part of its central understanding, the important idea in physics is energy. Energy is the theme that goes through contemporary physics. It talks about potential energy, and about kinetic energy: kinetic energy is energy to do with motion, and potential energy is to do with what would happen if the circumstances were right. In classical physics we can go a long way by knowing about conservation of energy (as well as conservation of momentum, angular momentum etc). Energy in quantum physics, the total of the kinetic and potential energies, is converted into what is called the Hamiltonian operator (normally abbreviated H). I will just say that this operator enters into the Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation, which governs all quantum wave forms. It thus generates all fields of probabilities, and hence all time evolution. All of the dynamics in quantum physics is specified by knowing what the initial state is, and what the Hamiltonian operator is. So, energy in some form is very important in both classical and quantum physics.\nThus, whenever I do quantum physics as part of my job in nuclear physics, I first try and find the Hamiltonian, then I solve Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nHY(x,t) = i\u00b6Y(x,t)/\u00b6 t.\nHere, the Hamiltonian H is an operator acting on the wave function which tells us how the wave function changes, by means of the derivative of the wave function with respect to time on the right hand side of the equation. In this way, the Hamiltonian determines all the dynamics, as we can solve this equation to find the wave function at all places x and times t into the future. The central equation in quantum physics is an equation of this form (perhaps the Schr\u00f6dinger or the Dirac equation), which always has a time derivative which tells how the wave function varies with time. Furthermore, once we have this wave function, we can find probabilities by taking its square modulus |Y(x,t)|2. The question is now, do we see a triad of end > cause > effect in this structure? I have just described the structure of quantum physics as every atomic physicist, every nuclear physicist practices it. Do we see the triad there? I claim that we do, if we look properly.\nFigure 2: Correspondences of Quantum and Mental Processes\nThree Quantum Degrees\nI claim that that there are three things. To help you understand, at the bottom of Figure 2, I have drawn the correspondences to what they are in the mind. Those of you that know quantum physics can look up at the top, and those that know Swedenborg can look at the bottom, and then I want to make a connection between these. If you know one, these connections will help you understand the other. Thus, looking again at quantum physics, we have the Hamiltonian which is to do with total energy, which is somehow active, since it is an operator which operates on the wave function and changes it. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is the rule for how the Hamiltonian operator produces what we can call the \u0091tendency wave\u0092: a wave function which is a form of propensities or tendencies for action: a probability wave. Then this wave function (in fact its squared modulus) gives a probability for different outcomes. This is the structure of quantum physics, and in this structure we now see the same kind of structure of triadic degrees that we have in our minds. At the bottom of Figure 2 is a very simple triad from psychology. If we look just in our external mind, then we have intention, thinking about plans, both leading to action. This is the corresponding triad to the processes in quantum physics (of course, not the same triad). From Swedenborg we know about love > wisdom > use (or affection > understanding > decision, or celestial > spiritual > natural) and we have in general correspondences to all these triads. We know that the same pattern repeats itself in the whole, and in each part. I am talking about every single process for every single particle in quantum physics: every time any smallest thing evolves in time, we see the same triadic pattern.\nWe see that there is a correspondence between energy and intention. It is very popular these days to use energy in a very general way to refer to all of intentions in our mind and in our spirit: we talk about mental energy, and about spiritual energy. Many people confuse these: they conflate spiritual energy with physical energy, saying that these are just different kinds of energies. Here we can see that they correspond to each other. Swedenborg would use \u0091heat\u0092 and \u0091light\u0092 (DLW 5), and I think that the word \u0091energy\u0092 is a good general interpretation of the meaning of \u0091heat\u0092 or calor. In the top middle we have waves or field structures, where Swedenborg refers to light, but these waves are waves of energy, that are spreading out and trying to do something. We know that light is a form of energy, while Swedenborg says \u0091wisdom is the form of love\u0092 (AE 1170[6]), or \u0091intentions take form in the understanding\u0092. There are many similarities in the logical structure of the sentences which connect these first two degrees.\nFor those of you who wonder how quantum physics differs from physics that we know, I will just give a brief demonstration of how this makes a difference. Imagine someone roller-skating in a hollow. In classical physics there is a limit, not unexpectedly called the \u0091classical turning point\u0092, at which the kinetic energy runs out, as energy has all turned into potential energy. In quantum theory, by contrast, there is no sharp limit, since everything is based on tendencies, and is not just predetermined and rigid. If this were an electron in an atom, then it appears with a small probability even in what is called the \u0091classically forbidden region\u0092. This is extremely important in quantum physics, and gives rise to what in my mind is interesting about quantum processes. It is essential to understanding things such as transistors, where electrons tunnel through very thin layers, because if you have another dip on the right hand side then they can get through. The same thing appears with radioactive decay, because the proton or alpha particle inside a big nucleus has a big barrier which stops it getting out, but it can still tunnel out with a very small probability and therefore you get a very long lifetime, such as thousands of millions of years, but it still gets out eventually. That is one of the differences between classical and quantum physics, because there are tendencies and not just hard and fast limits. The fact of having tendencies is related to what Swedenborg tells us concerning intentions, or conatus, that produce the results without having a fixed connection between them.\nWhat I have given so far is a brief summary of the correspondence between energy and waves of quantum physics, and intention and thoughts or understanding in the mind. We should really draw the mind above the physical degree, so intention, understanding and effects produce, and correspond to, energy and wave forms.\nQuantum Field Theory\nIn quantum physics, the starting Hamiltonian is composed of kinetic and potential energy. Now the question is, where does the Hamiltonian come from? I\u0092m going to try and describe what is called quantum field theory. You may not follow the details, but it is important to my argument that physics has discovered more of what, so to speak, is \u0091behind\u0092 the Hamiltonian. When quantum physics started 70 years ago, physicists had to invent the Hamiltonian. There were various clues and tricks, and if the results came out right you knew that you were successful. But, in reality, there is some physics behind that. We now know that the potential energy part of the Hamiltonian is not just arbitrary, but comes about from what are called virtual processes. We know that the electromagnetic forces between two charged particles are not just given by Maxwell\u0092s equations, but are given by \u0091virtual photons\u0092 or \u0091gamma rays\u0092 that are exchanged. The nuclear attraction between two protons, or between a proton and a neutron is not just arbitrary, but is given by the exchange of quarks and gluons. Quarks are attracted to each other by exchanging gluons. So there is something going on \u0091behind the scenes\u0092 of what I have described so far, which produces the Hamiltonian. What are these events? Furthermore, the kinetic energy, which is to do with mass, is said by physicists to be \u0091dressed\u0092 by virtual processes. This means, for example, that a bare electron has a cloud of photons that go along with it, because it is continually emitting and receiving photons, and these photons contribute mass via their energy of their own. So even the mass and the kinetic energy are not things that are given immediately, but are also produced from behind the scenes, and appear in the Hamiltonian which contains kinetic and potential energy together.\nFigure 3: Forces from exchange of virtual particles\nI will just mention what some of these virtual processes are, as pictured in Figure 3. This is physics that has been discovered in the last 50 years: that the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles is by exchange of photons; the nuclear forces between protons and neutrons is by exchange of a gluon; the weak interaction is by exchange of \u0091heavy vector mesons\u0092 called the Z and W particles. In physics we say that there are four kinds of interactions altogether. There are these three here: electromagnetism, nuclear and weak forces; and the fourth one is gravity. So far I have not said much about gravity, but will come back to that later. The point I want to make is that all of these things are going on behind the scenes, and physicists say that these are virtual particles. They are not actually happening, but sort of \u0091virtually\u0092 happening. Then there is a challenge to us to understand what on earth is going on? The way I want you to think about it, is that these virtual processes are the means by which plans are produced. Remember I said that we have intention, understand and effects. The understanding has all these plans, but the question is: how are these plans worked out? There must be something to help these be worked out. From Swedenborg we know that all the thoughts to do with this working out come from prior levels (AC 6200). We know that the influx from the heavens is essential for us to even think, to even get our understanding working, and to operate our plans. So, what I propose to help us to understand virtual processes, is that there is another layer of three (triadic) stages as in Figure 4.\nFigure 4: Triads of virtual processes produce actual processes\nNot all of you will have understood exactly what physicists mean by field theory, but what I want to demonstrate is that, by looking at these triadic groups and postulating another prior group, we get some ideas which help us to understand quantum physics. This prior layer describes virtual processes, or potential energies, and the bottom layer is what I had to start with, which deals with the energy, the tendencies and the actual events. The point is that this new layer contains its own autonomous degree of processes, in which virtual events are produced by virtual quantum fields, starting off by what in physics is called the \u0091field Lagrangian\u0092. We don\u0092t really know where the Lagrangian comes from, so again we have the same problem, but at least we can see that the virtual processes help prepare the kinetic and potential energies, and hence help prepare the tendencies. Note that there are virtual processes appearing even if there is nothing actually happening. Even if you take the space in this room between atoms, there are still virtual processes going on. The physicists say that there is \u0091zero point energy\u0092, and that there is a \u0091physical vacuum\u0092 which consists of fluctuations of the zero-point energy. What they imply is that there are virtual fields even though there might not be particle fields, and that these virtual fields produce measurable effects.\nI want now to identify these two layers with the \u0091air\u0092 layer and the \u0091middle ether\u0092 layer of Swedenborg (LJP 320) as shown in the figure, because his middle ether is the one he said was associated with the planets and their magnetism. He knew about magnetism, and he knew about planets. The main function of virtual events is the production of electrostatic attraction & repulsion, and magnetic forces, between charged particles. We now know that magnetism does not exist by itself, and is always combined with electrostatics: we talk of electro-magnetism. So we reinterpret Swedenborg\u0092s \u0091magnetism\u0092 as that with which we know it is unified, namely electromagnetism. This looks like the middle ether. It is in the correct order, and has the correct internal structure, from Swedenborg\u0092s point of view. We have the same pattern: a principle going to causes and then to effects. We do not know where the principle comes from, but we can see that it is a principle. This is the principle that physicists have used until recently as the initial point to describe quantum field theory. They start by writing down the Lagrangian, and look at all the terms in the Lagrangian, to work out all the possible virtual processes. They work out one-step and two-step processes for these virtual events, using for example perturbation theory. Then they work out the potential and kinetic energies, and carry on with the Hamiltonian and wave functions etc. This is all just describing in a simple way what physicists do these days. A picture of this (without the words \u0091middle ether\u0092 or \u0091air\u0092, of course) would be agreeable to my colleagues at work (I have tried it out on them 13 ), so it is sensible from the physics point of view. The only thing that they find a little bit odd is that there is this strict order. There is no sort of give and take, no reciprocal interactions: I have always drawn the arrows \u0091producing\u0092 like to the right or down, so the whole business is that of influx: conditional influx. What you need to receive influx is something I don\u0092t have time to talk about: that is really another talk 14 . At least from Swedenborg we know that there is such an order.\nGravity\nWe have a middle ether, and we have air, so what about gravity? That is the thing that is missing there. Let\u0092s summarise what we know about gravity, very briefly. The best theory of gravity is Einstein\u0092s General Theory of Relativity. It is still the best theory: no-one has disproved it. Physicists are not happy with it, for reasons which I will explain, but it is still the best theory. In this theory, space and time are \u0091curved\u0092 by gravity, according to the distribution of matter. I am not going to write down Einstein\u0092s equations, but his basic idea is that the curvature of spacetime is due to the mass and energy in spacetime. There is no mention of probabilities, so it is again a classical theory. The result of this is that questions of quantum gravity are hotly discussed: the question of how to combine probabilities with the idea of curved spacetime. There have been frequent discussions of how we could possibly have in quantum gravity such a combination. For example, if space and time are somehow probabilistically generated, then how do you talk about probabilities, if we don\u0092t have a distribution of space in which to have probabilities? There must be \u0091alternatives\u0092 of some kind! I hope that if we have insight into these problems of quantum gravity from Swedenborg, then we will be able to cast some light on these fundamental problems.\nAccording to Swedenborg, if we are in the spiritual world, we know that the space and time in the spiritual world are very flexible, let\u0092s put it that way. Space depends on our mental state and our spiritual state. We know that if two people\u0092s loves are similar, then they are close together in the spiritual world. We know that the Sun, the state of the Lord in the heavens, is so different from the state of angels that it appears at an enormous distance from them, shining on them. We also know that time is very flexible in the spiritual world. It seems to be a rule that, if someone asks you to do something, and you say that you are going to do it immediately but you want to do lots of other things beforehand, you always have \u0091time\u0092 for a diversion to do whatever else you wanted to do, and then come back to what the person asked you to do. There is no clock time in the spiritual world: there is only a succession of states. You can always have many successions of states of one kind between successive states of something else, and there is not the same rate of succession in different parts. Again, we see that space and time vary according to loves.\nNow I am going to present some ideas which are not really a theory, but an attempt at a unified view of what is going on, so we can begin to see correspondences. According to Swedenborg, loves dynamically generate the geometry of space and time that we have in the spiritual world (DLW 7, TCR 29). But we know that loves correspond to energies, so let\u0092s take this sentence and translate it by correspondences into physics. We end up with the statement, that the energies dynamically generate the geometry of space and time in the physical world. This is exactly what General Relativity says. We don\u0092t really understand the connections between loves and energies, or how exactly this works, but we can see the beginnings of some ideas which may in the future generate some insights. This suggests that our layers of air and middle ether need to be extended to include what I call a prior \u0091formative\u0092 degree. This is very speculative: I am using ideas of correspondences from Swedenborg to fill in the gaps.\n1 General Principle\n"}, {"score": 2490.8545, "uuid": "4eac5985-73b9-551c-a8f3-49c86e02f247", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0703wb-25-04669", "target_hostname": "www.theisticscience.org", "target_uri": "http://www.theisticscience.org/talks/qps1/index.htm", "page_rank": 1.2258711e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "Are <em>QUANTUM</em> <em>PHYSICS</em> <em>and</em> SPIRITUALITY related?", "snippet": "That <em>is</em> one of <em>the</em> <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> classical <em>and</em> <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em>, because there are tendencies <em>and</em> not just hard <em>and</em> fast limits.", "explanation": null, "document": "E.H. Walker 6\nFigure 1: Suggested means for getting one definite actuality\nThose of you that have read some popular physics will recognise some of these alternatives, and they are all designed to answer the same measurement problem. The first suggestion is called Everett\u0092s many-worlds interpretation, in which there is not any real selection, but all alternatives occur the same time, for example in some set of parallel universes. The second theory of \u0091decoherence\u0092 says that it really like that, but that it appears to a good approximation as if only one outcome occurs. Niels Bohr thought it was the fact that experimental apparatus was \u0091classical\u0092, with no wave behaviour, that gives rise to a particular outcome. We now know that quantum physics applies to the experimental apparatus as well, so that does not really solve the problem. Werner Heisenberg, Eugene Wigner and Henry Stapp have in turn introduced the speculation that selection is something to do with consciousness or mind, and this has given rise to a whole stream of suggestions in which consciousness (or something) has become more and more involved in trying to solve the problem of quantum physics.\nWigner in a paper of 40 years ago suggested that it was the consciousness of the observing scientist, and this idea has been carried on by Stapp, who says that consciousness is actually involved in the brain. Stapp believes that since a quantum brain has many alternate things that can happen, consciousness selects one of these outcomes to produce a result. I have listed other alternatives here, which get progressively more \u0091way out\u0092. A few of these ideas we can imagine being true, for example that \u0091spirit produces nature\u0092, but some people have gone even further than that, and have said that nature is somehow essentially spiritual \u0096 that it is connected with, or equal to, the spiritual. Others have continued this theme to say that quantum physics is a way of learning about spirituality, a way to regain our spirituality. There is a great range of possible solutions here that try to solve the same problem: how something that is described by a wave can produce a definite outcome. The trouble starts from the fact that when physicists think about nature, they only have two ideas in mind: they can think of a wave or a particle 7 . The difficulty is that the objects which quantum physics tells us are in nature are not just waves, and not just particles, so the challenge is to find a new understanding and a new picture.\nAs well as the more extreme ideas above, there are further ideas that have been proposed. James Jeans, the mathematical physicist, wrote 8 about 60 years ago that \u0093the wave function looks like not something solid and substantial, but looks more like an \u0091idea\u0092\u0094. Some (e.g. Zohar 9 ) have taken this to mean that quantum physics tells us about ideas. Others, discussing the putative identity of spirit and nature, have tried to work out various ways for why they appear to be different. They have said that perhaps spirit and nature are different grades of energies, different frequencies, different dimensions, and/or different \u0091fineness\u0092 of material. Those of us with backgrounds from Swedenborg will recognise that suggesting \u0091different dimensions\u0092 here is trying to use spatial analogies (thinking from ideas of space) to distinguish mind from nature. When people try to talk about \u0091different frequencies\u0092, they are using temporal analogies to think about this difference. But we know from Swedenborg that we cannot really use either of these kinds of analogies (TCR 30).\nFrom Swedenborg we think we know which of all the above ideas make sense, that is, which of them could possibly be true. Let us point out which ones these might be, before discussing which ones are true. We know that choosing to do one particular thing cannot be just an illusion, because otherwise it would make a mockery of trying to order one\u0092s life. We know that particular outcomes are chosen, so that it cannot really just be a good approximation that selections do occur. We know that consciousness is perhaps involved. It is not ruled out, because we know from Swedenborg that spirit produces nature, and it may be that consciousness, as part of spirit, is involved. But we know that the last three ideas (9-11) cannot be true, because we know that there is an essential difference between nature and spirit, which means that we have to find a different kind of connection between quantum physics and spirituality, that is not just identity. There must be another kind of connection. Of the next set of ideas, we know that distinctions based on time or dimensions cannot be true. We know that the true distinction is not based on \u0091fineness\u0092 or \u0091subtlety\u0092: Swedenborg has comments to make about that (HH 38, TCR 280). It may be true that the wave function looks like an idea, but that is only true if we take the word \u0091like\u0092 to refer to correspondence rather than to be just equal.\nMultiple Levels\nAll of the above is a very brief and necessarily cursory introduction to how we can use Swedenborg to understand modern physics. I am going to discuss the existence of \u0091multiple generative levels\u0092 or \u0091discrete levels\u0092. Swedenborg makes a great effort to distinguish discrete from continuous levels (HH 38, DLW 184ff), and what I want to show is that there are discrete levels within the natural, that is, within quantum physics. This will help us to understand what is going on in physics. Furthermore, these discrete levels within the natural will correspond to other discrete levels we know about within spiritual processes. Thus, we have this triadic structure within the natural, as well as within the spiritual, and these are linked together by correspondences. This is the overall theme for what follows.\nIf we recapitulate what Swedenborg tells us about how spirit and nature are combined, and if we look at what Swedenborg said after he was told what was actually happening rather than what he tried to guess at in his earlier years, which is quite different, then we see that he later in his life learned that the spirit is an essential means in the creation of nature. Nature is not created immediately from the Infinite, but is created by means of the spirit. He came to see that the natural world is a final effect of causes working in the spiritual world, which themselves manifest certain forms of love. So, as a consequence, this pattern of love > wisdom > effect is the pattern that we can try to use to understand what is happening in quantum physics.\nThis pattern can be summarised in many ways: love > wisdom > effect; or soul > mind > body, as the same triadic pattern. Swedenborg gives us ample reason to show that this is repeated in the soul: we have celestial, spiritual and spiritual-natural. It is repeated in the mind: we have an interior rational, an exterior natural, and a sensory mind. So the question is, it is also repeated in the natural world?\nSwedenborg has a variety of things to say about degrees in the natural world (see e.g Hugo Lj. Odhner\u0092s article 10 ). When Swedenborg started, he had quite a few different ideas that varied from book to book. I am going to talk about his \u0091ethers\u0092, which is something about which he changed his mind a number of times, also concerning how they are related to the spiritual world 11 . If we read from Last Judgement (Posthumous),\n\u0093the three natural atmospheres arising from the sun of the world are the purer ether, which is universal, from which is all gravitation; the middle ether, which forms the vortex around the planets, in which are the moons and the satellites, from which is magnetism; and the ultimate ether which is the air.\u0094 (LJP 320)\nThis is where he talks about three degrees in nature. These days, we don\u0092t believe in \u0091ether\u0092, but the question is whether we can interpret what he says about purer, middle, and ultimate ethers in such a way that makes sense. I am going to assume that these three adjectives refer to different kinds of ethers. He might not have known from the scientific point of view what they were, but they certainly appear to be three different things, and certainly not three different vacuums 12 . But do we recognise this pattern? Does it make sense to us? We have to allow some flexibility in the interpretation of what he meant by ether, but he does tell us what are the functions of these three ethers. He tells us that the first one is to do with gravity, the middle one is to do with magnetism, and the final one is to do with material things. Do those descriptions make sense?\nLet us try and work out what three degrees in the natural might be, if we use New Church principles to work out a priori what those degrees might be expected to consist of. From the correspondences of the natural with the three degrees in the spiritual, then in the natural there must be (a) a way of receiving in the body the intentions of the spirit, furthermore there must be (b) a propagation of causes within the natural, and there must be (c) a way of producing effects in the natural. We can think of these as ends, cause, and effects, all in the natural. This is what we expect to see from Swedenborg\u0092s point of view. Is there a way of looking at the natural that we know about from science, in which we see these three degrees?\nIn modern physics we do not know anything about ends; in fact we deliberately refuse to consider ends in physics, as a rule. But we know a great deal about the propagation of causes in physics: that is what physics does extremely well. It tells us how causes propagate through sequences and the various changes produced. And in physics we know some little about effects. In fact, the irony is that the whole business I talked about earlier, of getting a definite outcome in quantum physics, is precisely because physics does not know enough about the actual effects. So it is clear that contemporary physics knows a lot about propagation of causes, and it knows almost everything about the production of effects, though there is still something missing from what quantum physics tells about the final effects. Thus, if Swedenborg has any light to cast on what these three degrees are, it should help fill in an important lacuna, a noticeable gap in quantum physics, which is the production of effects.\nEnergy\nIf we look at physics, and at what physics regards as part of its central understanding, the important idea in physics is energy. Energy is the theme that goes through contemporary physics. It talks about potential energy, and about kinetic energy: kinetic energy is energy to do with motion, and potential energy is to do with what would happen if the circumstances were right. In classical physics we can go a long way by knowing about conservation of energy (as well as conservation of momentum, angular momentum etc). Energy in quantum physics, the total of the kinetic and potential energies, is converted into what is called the Hamiltonian operator (normally abbreviated H). I will just say that this operator enters into the Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation, which governs all quantum wave forms. It thus generates all fields of probabilities, and hence all time evolution. All of the dynamics in quantum physics is specified by knowing what the initial state is, and what the Hamiltonian operator is. So, energy in some form is very important in both classical and quantum physics.\nThus, whenever I do quantum physics as part of my job in nuclear physics, I first try and find the Hamiltonian, then I solve Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nHY(x,t) = i\u00b6Y(x,t)/\u00b6 t.\nHere, the Hamiltonian H is an operator acting on the wave function which tells us how the wave function changes, by means of the derivative of the wave function with respect to time on the right hand side of the equation. In this way, the Hamiltonian determines all the dynamics, as we can solve this equation to find the wave function at all places x and times t into the future. The central equation in quantum physics is an equation of this form (perhaps the Schr\u00f6dinger or the Dirac equation), which always has a time derivative which tells how the wave function varies with time. Furthermore, once we have this wave function, we can find probabilities by taking its square modulus |Y(x,t)|2. The question is now, do we see a triad of end > cause > effect in this structure? I have just described the structure of quantum physics as every atomic physicist, every nuclear physicist practices it. Do we see the triad there? I claim that we do, if we look properly.\nFigure 2: Correspondences of Quantum and Mental Processes\nThree Quantum Degrees\nI claim that that there are three things. To help you understand, at the bottom of Figure 2, I have drawn the correspondences to what they are in the mind. Those of you that know quantum physics can look up at the top, and those that know Swedenborg can look at the bottom, and then I want to make a connection between these. If you know one, these connections will help you understand the other. Thus, looking again at quantum physics, we have the Hamiltonian which is to do with total energy, which is somehow active, since it is an operator which operates on the wave function and changes it. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is the rule for how the Hamiltonian operator produces what we can call the \u0091tendency wave\u0092: a wave function which is a form of propensities or tendencies for action: a probability wave. Then this wave function (in fact its squared modulus) gives a probability for different outcomes. This is the structure of quantum physics, and in this structure we now see the same kind of structure of triadic degrees that we have in our minds. At the bottom of Figure 2 is a very simple triad from psychology. If we look just in our external mind, then we have intention, thinking about plans, both leading to action. This is the corresponding triad to the processes in quantum physics (of course, not the same triad). From Swedenborg we know about love > wisdom > use (or affection > understanding > decision, or celestial > spiritual > natural) and we have in general correspondences to all these triads. We know that the same pattern repeats itself in the whole, and in each part. I am talking about every single process for every single particle in quantum physics: every time any smallest thing evolves in time, we see the same triadic pattern.\nWe see that there is a correspondence between energy and intention. It is very popular these days to use energy in a very general way to refer to all of intentions in our mind and in our spirit: we talk about mental energy, and about spiritual energy. Many people confuse these: they conflate spiritual energy with physical energy, saying that these are just different kinds of energies. Here we can see that they correspond to each other. Swedenborg would use \u0091heat\u0092 and \u0091light\u0092 (DLW 5), and I think that the word \u0091energy\u0092 is a good general interpretation of the meaning of \u0091heat\u0092 or calor. In the top middle we have waves or field structures, where Swedenborg refers to light, but these waves are waves of energy, that are spreading out and trying to do something. We know that light is a form of energy, while Swedenborg says \u0091wisdom is the form of love\u0092 (AE 1170[6]), or \u0091intentions take form in the understanding\u0092. There are many similarities in the logical structure of the sentences which connect these first two degrees.\nFor those of you who wonder how quantum physics differs from physics that we know, I will just give a brief demonstration of how this makes a difference. Imagine someone roller-skating in a hollow. In classical physics there is a limit, not unexpectedly called the \u0091classical turning point\u0092, at which the kinetic energy runs out, as energy has all turned into potential energy. In quantum theory, by contrast, there is no sharp limit, since everything is based on tendencies, and is not just predetermined and rigid. If this were an electron in an atom, then it appears with a small probability even in what is called the \u0091classically forbidden region\u0092. This is extremely important in quantum physics, and gives rise to what in my mind is interesting about quantum processes. It is essential to understanding things such as transistors, where electrons tunnel through very thin layers, because if you have another dip on the right hand side then they can get through. The same thing appears with radioactive decay, because the proton or alpha particle inside a big nucleus has a big barrier which stops it getting out, but it can still tunnel out with a very small probability and therefore you get a very long lifetime, such as thousands of millions of years, but it still gets out eventually. That is one of the differences between classical and quantum physics, because there are tendencies and not just hard and fast limits. The fact of having tendencies is related to what Swedenborg tells us concerning intentions, or conatus, that produce the results without having a fixed connection between them.\nWhat I have given so far is a brief summary of the correspondence between energy and waves of quantum physics, and intention and thoughts or understanding in the mind. We should really draw the mind above the physical degree, so intention, understanding and effects produce, and correspond to, energy and wave forms.\nQuantum Field Theory\nIn quantum physics, the starting Hamiltonian is composed of kinetic and potential energy. Now the question is, where does the Hamiltonian come from? I\u0092m going to try and describe what is called quantum field theory. You may not follow the details, but it is important to my argument that physics has discovered more of what, so to speak, is \u0091behind\u0092 the Hamiltonian. When quantum physics started 70 years ago, physicists had to invent the Hamiltonian. There were various clues and tricks, and if the results came out right you knew that you were successful. But, in reality, there is some physics behind that. We now know that the potential energy part of the Hamiltonian is not just arbitrary, but comes about from what are called virtual processes. We know that the electromagnetic forces between two charged particles are not just given by Maxwell\u0092s equations, but are given by \u0091virtual photons\u0092 or \u0091gamma rays\u0092 that are exchanged. The nuclear attraction between two protons, or between a proton and a neutron is not just arbitrary, but is given by the exchange of quarks and gluons. Quarks are attracted to each other by exchanging gluons. So there is something going on \u0091behind the scenes\u0092 of what I have described so far, which produces the Hamiltonian. What are these events? Furthermore, the kinetic energy, which is to do with mass, is said by physicists to be \u0091dressed\u0092 by virtual processes. This means, for example, that a bare electron has a cloud of photons that go along with it, because it is continually emitting and receiving photons, and these photons contribute mass via their energy of their own. So even the mass and the kinetic energy are not things that are given immediately, but are also produced from behind the scenes, and appear in the Hamiltonian which contains kinetic and potential energy together.\nFigure 3: Forces from exchange of virtual particles\nI will just mention what some of these virtual processes are, as pictured in Figure 3. This is physics that has been discovered in the last 50 years: that the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles is by exchange of photons; the nuclear forces between protons and neutrons is by exchange of a gluon; the weak interaction is by exchange of \u0091heavy vector mesons\u0092 called the Z and W particles. In physics we say that there are four kinds of interactions altogether. There are these three here: electromagnetism, nuclear and weak forces; and the fourth one is gravity. So far I have not said much about gravity, but will come back to that later. The point I want to make is that all of these things are going on behind the scenes, and physicists say that these are virtual particles. They are not actually happening, but sort of \u0091virtually\u0092 happening. Then there is a challenge to us to understand what on earth is going on? The way I want you to think about it, is that these virtual processes are the means by which plans are produced. Remember I said that we have intention, understand and effects. The understanding has all these plans, but the question is: how are these plans worked out? There must be something to help these be worked out. From Swedenborg we know that all the thoughts to do with this working out come from prior levels (AC 6200). We know that the influx from the heavens is essential for us to even think, to even get our understanding working, and to operate our plans. So, what I propose to help us to understand virtual processes, is that there is another layer of three (triadic) stages as in Figure 4.\nFigure 4: Triads of virtual processes produce actual processes\nNot all of you will have understood exactly what physicists mean by field theory, but what I want to demonstrate is that, by looking at these triadic groups and postulating another prior group, we get some ideas which help us to understand quantum physics. This prior layer describes virtual processes, or potential energies, and the bottom layer is what I had to start with, which deals with the energy, the tendencies and the actual events. The point is that this new layer contains its own autonomous degree of processes, in which virtual events are produced by virtual quantum fields, starting off by what in physics is called the \u0091field Lagrangian\u0092. We don\u0092t really know where the Lagrangian comes from, so again we have the same problem, but at least we can see that the virtual processes help prepare the kinetic and potential energies, and hence help prepare the tendencies. Note that there are virtual processes appearing even if there is nothing actually happening. Even if you take the space in this room between atoms, there are still virtual processes going on. The physicists say that there is \u0091zero point energy\u0092, and that there is a \u0091physical vacuum\u0092 which consists of fluctuations of the zero-point energy. What they imply is that there are virtual fields even though there might not be particle fields, and that these virtual fields produce measurable effects.\nI want now to identify these two layers with the \u0091air\u0092 layer and the \u0091middle ether\u0092 layer of Swedenborg (LJP 320) as shown in the figure, because his middle ether is the one he said was associated with the planets and their magnetism. He knew about magnetism, and he knew about planets. The main function of virtual events is the production of electrostatic attraction & repulsion, and magnetic forces, between charged particles. We now know that magnetism does not exist by itself, and is always combined with electrostatics: we talk of electro-magnetism. So we reinterpret Swedenborg\u0092s \u0091magnetism\u0092 as that with which we know it is unified, namely electromagnetism. This looks like the middle ether. It is in the correct order, and has the correct internal structure, from Swedenborg\u0092s point of view. We have the same pattern: a principle going to causes and then to effects. We do not know where the principle comes from, but we can see that it is a principle. This is the principle that physicists have used until recently as the initial point to describe quantum field theory. They start by writing down the Lagrangian, and look at all the terms in the Lagrangian, to work out all the possible virtual processes. They work out one-step and two-step processes for these virtual events, using for example perturbation theory. Then they work out the potential and kinetic energies, and carry on with the Hamiltonian and wave functions etc. This is all just describing in a simple way what physicists do these days. A picture of this (without the words \u0091middle ether\u0092 or \u0091air\u0092, of course) would be agreeable to my colleagues at work (I have tried it out on them 13 ), so it is sensible from the physics point of view. The only thing that they find a little bit odd is that there is this strict order. There is no sort of give and take, no reciprocal interactions: I have always drawn the arrows \u0091producing\u0092 like to the right or down, so the whole business is that of influx: conditional influx. What you need to receive influx is something I don\u0092t have time to talk about: that is really another talk 14 . At least from Swedenborg we know that there is such an order.\nGravity\nWe have a middle ether, and we have air, so what about gravity? That is the thing that is missing there. Let\u0092s summarise what we know about gravity, very briefly. The best theory of gravity is Einstein\u0092s General Theory of Relativity. It is still the best theory: no-one has disproved it. Physicists are not happy with it, for reasons which I will explain, but it is still the best theory. In this theory, space and time are \u0091curved\u0092 by gravity, according to the distribution of matter. I am not going to write down Einstein\u0092s equations, but his basic idea is that the curvature of spacetime is due to the mass and energy in spacetime. There is no mention of probabilities, so it is again a classical theory. The result of this is that questions of quantum gravity are hotly discussed: the question of how to combine probabilities with the idea of curved spacetime. There have been frequent discussions of how we could possibly have in quantum gravity such a combination. For example, if space and time are somehow probabilistically generated, then how do you talk about probabilities, if we don\u0092t have a distribution of space in which to have probabilities? There must be \u0091alternatives\u0092 of some kind! I hope that if we have insight into these problems of quantum gravity from Swedenborg, then we will be able to cast some light on these fundamental problems.\nAccording to Swedenborg, if we are in the spiritual world, we know that the space and time in the spiritual world are very flexible, let\u0092s put it that way. Space depends on our mental state and our spiritual state. We know that if two people\u0092s loves are similar, then they are close together in the spiritual world. We know that the Sun, the state of the Lord in the heavens, is so different from the state of angels that it appears at an enormous distance from them, shining on them. We also know that time is very flexible in the spiritual world. It seems to be a rule that, if someone asks you to do something, and you say that you are going to do it immediately but you want to do lots of other things beforehand, you always have \u0091time\u0092 for a diversion to do whatever else you wanted to do, and then come back to what the person asked you to do. There is no clock time in the spiritual world: there is only a succession of states. You can always have many successions of states of one kind between successive states of something else, and there is not the same rate of succession in different parts. Again, we see that space and time vary according to loves.\nNow I am going to present some ideas which are not really a theory, but an attempt at a unified view of what is going on, so we can begin to see correspondences. According to Swedenborg, loves dynamically generate the geometry of space and time that we have in the spiritual world (DLW 7, TCR 29). But we know that loves correspond to energies, so let\u0092s take this sentence and translate it by correspondences into physics. We end up with the statement, that the energies dynamically generate the geometry of space and time in the physical world. This is exactly what General Relativity says. We don\u0092t really understand the connections between loves and energies, or how exactly this works, but we can see the beginnings of some ideas which may in the future generate some insights. This suggests that our layers of air and middle ether need to be extended to include what I call a prior \u0091formative\u0092 degree. This is very speculative: I am using ideas of correspondences from Swedenborg to fill in the gaps.\n1 General Principle\n"}, {"score": 2488.7793, "uuid": "47de8580-4e6b-5898-b811-3fc47d5d1a56", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0706wb-44-11877", "target_hostname": "www.theisticscience.org", "target_uri": "http://www.theisticscience.org/talks/qps1/index.html", "page_rank": 1.930427e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Are <em>QUANTUM</em> <em>PHYSICS</em> <em>and</em> SPIRITUALITY related?", "snippet": "That <em>is</em> one of <em>the</em> <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> classical <em>and</em> <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em>, because there are tendencies <em>and</em> not just hard <em>and</em> fast limits.", "explanation": null, "document": "E.H. Walker 6\nFigure 1: Suggested means for getting one definite actuality\nThose of you that have read some popular physics will recognise some of these alternatives, and they are all designed to answer the same measurement problem. The first suggestion is called Everett\u0092s many-worlds interpretation, in which there is not any real selection, but all alternatives occur the same time, for example in some set of parallel universes. The second theory of \u0091decoherence\u0092 says that it really like that, but that it appears to a good approximation as if only one outcome occurs. Niels Bohr thought it was the fact that experimental apparatus was \u0091classical\u0092, with no wave behaviour, that gives rise to a particular outcome. We now know that quantum physics applies to the experimental apparatus as well, so that does not really solve the problem. Werner Heisenberg, Eugene Wigner and Henry Stapp have in turn introduced the speculation that selection is something to do with consciousness or mind, and this has given rise to a whole stream of suggestions in which consciousness (or something) has become more and more involved in trying to solve the problem of quantum physics.\nWigner in a paper of 40 years ago suggested that it was the consciousness of the observing scientist, and this idea has been carried on by Stapp, who says that consciousness is actually involved in the brain. Stapp believes that since a quantum brain has many alternate things that can happen, consciousness selects one of these outcomes to produce a result. I have listed other alternatives here, which get progressively more \u0091way out\u0092. A few of these ideas we can imagine being true, for example that \u0091spirit produces nature\u0092, but some people have gone even further than that, and have said that nature is somehow essentially spiritual \u0096 that it is connected with, or equal to, the spiritual. Others have continued this theme to say that quantum physics is a way of learning about spirituality, a way to regain our spirituality. There is a great range of possible solutions here that try to solve the same problem: how something that is described by a wave can produce a definite outcome. The trouble starts from the fact that when physicists think about nature, they only have two ideas in mind: they can think of a wave or a particle 7 . The difficulty is that the objects which quantum physics tells us are in nature are not just waves, and not just particles, so the challenge is to find a new understanding and a new picture.\nAs well as the more extreme ideas above, there are further ideas that have been proposed. James Jeans, the mathematical physicist, wrote 8 about 60 years ago that \u0093the wave function looks like not something solid and substantial, but looks more like an \u0091idea\u0092\u0094. Some (e.g. Zohar 9 ) have taken this to mean that quantum physics tells us about ideas. Others, discussing the putative identity of spirit and nature, have tried to work out various ways for why they appear to be different. They have said that perhaps spirit and nature are different grades of energies, different frequencies, different dimensions, and/or different \u0091fineness\u0092 of material. Those of us with backgrounds from Swedenborg will recognise that suggesting \u0091different dimensions\u0092 here is trying to use spatial analogies (thinking from ideas of space) to distinguish mind from nature. When people try to talk about \u0091different frequencies\u0092, they are using temporal analogies to think about this difference. But we know from Swedenborg that we cannot really use either of these kinds of analogies (TCR 30).\nFrom Swedenborg we think we know which of all the above ideas make sense, that is, which of them could possibly be true. Let us point out which ones these might be, before discussing which ones are true. We know that choosing to do one particular thing cannot be just an illusion, because otherwise it would make a mockery of trying to order one\u0092s life. We know that particular outcomes are chosen, so that it cannot really just be a good approximation that selections do occur. We know that consciousness is perhaps involved. It is not ruled out, because we know from Swedenborg that spirit produces nature, and it may be that consciousness, as part of spirit, is involved. But we know that the last three ideas (9-11) cannot be true, because we know that there is an essential difference between nature and spirit, which means that we have to find a different kind of connection between quantum physics and spirituality, that is not just identity. There must be another kind of connection. Of the next set of ideas, we know that distinctions based on time or dimensions cannot be true. We know that the true distinction is not based on \u0091fineness\u0092 or \u0091subtlety\u0092: Swedenborg has comments to make about that (HH 38, TCR 280). It may be true that the wave function looks like an idea, but that is only true if we take the word \u0091like\u0092 to refer to correspondence rather than to be just equal.\nMultiple Levels\nAll of the above is a very brief and necessarily cursory introduction to how we can use Swedenborg to understand modern physics. I am going to discuss the existence of \u0091multiple generative levels\u0092 or \u0091discrete levels\u0092. Swedenborg makes a great effort to distinguish discrete from continuous levels (HH 38, DLW 184ff), and what I want to show is that there are discrete levels within the natural, that is, within quantum physics. This will help us to understand what is going on in physics. Furthermore, these discrete levels within the natural will correspond to other discrete levels we know about within spiritual processes. Thus, we have this triadic structure within the natural, as well as within the spiritual, and these are linked together by correspondences. This is the overall theme for what follows.\nIf we recapitulate what Swedenborg tells us about how spirit and nature are combined, and if we look at what Swedenborg said after he was told what was actually happening rather than what he tried to guess at in his earlier years, which is quite different, then we see that he later in his life learned that the spirit is an essential means in the creation of nature. Nature is not created immediately from the Infinite, but is created by means of the spirit. He came to see that the natural world is a final effect of causes working in the spiritual world, which themselves manifest certain forms of love. So, as a consequence, this pattern of love > wisdom > effect is the pattern that we can try to use to understand what is happening in quantum physics.\nThis pattern can be summarised in many ways: love > wisdom > effect; or soul > mind > body, as the same triadic pattern. Swedenborg gives us ample reason to show that this is repeated in the soul: we have celestial, spiritual and spiritual-natural. It is repeated in the mind: we have an interior rational, an exterior natural, and a sensory mind. So the question is, it is also repeated in the natural world?\nSwedenborg has a variety of things to say about degrees in the natural world (see e.g Hugo Lj. Odhner\u0092s article 10 ). When Swedenborg started, he had quite a few different ideas that varied from book to book. I am going to talk about his \u0091ethers\u0092, which is something about which he changed his mind a number of times, also concerning how they are related to the spiritual world 11 . If we read from Last Judgement (Posthumous),\n\u0093the three natural atmospheres arising from the sun of the world are the purer ether, which is universal, from which is all gravitation; the middle ether, which forms the vortex around the planets, in which are the moons and the satellites, from which is magnetism; and the ultimate ether which is the air.\u0094 (LJP 320)\nThis is where he talks about three degrees in nature. These days, we don\u0092t believe in \u0091ether\u0092, but the question is whether we can interpret what he says about purer, middle, and ultimate ethers in such a way that makes sense. I am going to assume that these three adjectives refer to different kinds of ethers. He might not have known from the scientific point of view what they were, but they certainly appear to be three different things, and certainly not three different vacuums 12 . But do we recognise this pattern? Does it make sense to us? We have to allow some flexibility in the interpretation of what he meant by ether, but he does tell us what are the functions of these three ethers. He tells us that the first one is to do with gravity, the middle one is to do with magnetism, and the final one is to do with material things. Do those descriptions make sense?\nLet us try and work out what three degrees in the natural might be, if we use New Church principles to work out a priori what those degrees might be expected to consist of. From the correspondences of the natural with the three degrees in the spiritual, then in the natural there must be (a) a way of receiving in the body the intentions of the spirit, furthermore there must be (b) a propagation of causes within the natural, and there must be (c) a way of producing effects in the natural. We can think of these as ends, cause, and effects, all in the natural. This is what we expect to see from Swedenborg\u0092s point of view. Is there a way of looking at the natural that we know about from science, in which we see these three degrees?\nIn modern physics we do not know anything about ends; in fact we deliberately refuse to consider ends in physics, as a rule. But we know a great deal about the propagation of causes in physics: that is what physics does extremely well. It tells us how causes propagate through sequences and the various changes produced. And in physics we know some little about effects. In fact, the irony is that the whole business I talked about earlier, of getting a definite outcome in quantum physics, is precisely because physics does not know enough about the actual effects. So it is clear that contemporary physics knows a lot about propagation of causes, and it knows almost everything about the production of effects, though there is still something missing from what quantum physics tells about the final effects. Thus, if Swedenborg has any light to cast on what these three degrees are, it should help fill in an important lacuna, a noticeable gap in quantum physics, which is the production of effects.\nEnergy\nIf we look at physics, and at what physics regards as part of its central understanding, the important idea in physics is energy. Energy is the theme that goes through contemporary physics. It talks about potential energy, and about kinetic energy: kinetic energy is energy to do with motion, and potential energy is to do with what would happen if the circumstances were right. In classical physics we can go a long way by knowing about conservation of energy (as well as conservation of momentum, angular momentum etc). Energy in quantum physics, the total of the kinetic and potential energies, is converted into what is called the Hamiltonian operator (normally abbreviated H). I will just say that this operator enters into the Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation, which governs all quantum wave forms. It thus generates all fields of probabilities, and hence all time evolution. All of the dynamics in quantum physics is specified by knowing what the initial state is, and what the Hamiltonian operator is. So, energy in some form is very important in both classical and quantum physics.\nThus, whenever I do quantum physics as part of my job in nuclear physics, I first try and find the Hamiltonian, then I solve Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nHY(x,t) = i\u00b6Y(x,t)/\u00b6 t.\nHere, the Hamiltonian H is an operator acting on the wave function which tells us how the wave function changes, by means of the derivative of the wave function with respect to time on the right hand side of the equation. In this way, the Hamiltonian determines all the dynamics, as we can solve this equation to find the wave function at all places x and times t into the future. The central equation in quantum physics is an equation of this form (perhaps the Schr\u00f6dinger or the Dirac equation), which always has a time derivative which tells how the wave function varies with time. Furthermore, once we have this wave function, we can find probabilities by taking its square modulus |Y(x,t)|2. The question is now, do we see a triad of end > cause > effect in this structure? I have just described the structure of quantum physics as every atomic physicist, every nuclear physicist practices it. Do we see the triad there? I claim that we do, if we look properly.\nFigure 2: Correspondences of Quantum and Mental Processes\nThree Quantum Degrees\nI claim that that there are three things. To help you understand, at the bottom of Figure 2, I have drawn the correspondences to what they are in the mind. Those of you that know quantum physics can look up at the top, and those that know Swedenborg can look at the bottom, and then I want to make a connection between these. If you know one, these connections will help you understand the other. Thus, looking again at quantum physics, we have the Hamiltonian which is to do with total energy, which is somehow active, since it is an operator which operates on the wave function and changes it. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is the rule for how the Hamiltonian operator produces what we can call the \u0091tendency wave\u0092: a wave function which is a form of propensities or tendencies for action: a probability wave. Then this wave function (in fact its squared modulus) gives a probability for different outcomes. This is the structure of quantum physics, and in this structure we now see the same kind of structure of triadic degrees that we have in our minds. At the bottom of Figure 2 is a very simple triad from psychology. If we look just in our external mind, then we have intention, thinking about plans, both leading to action. This is the corresponding triad to the processes in quantum physics (of course, not the same triad). From Swedenborg we know about love > wisdom > use (or affection > understanding > decision, or celestial > spiritual > natural) and we have in general correspondences to all these triads. We know that the same pattern repeats itself in the whole, and in each part. I am talking about every single process for every single particle in quantum physics: every time any smallest thing evolves in time, we see the same triadic pattern.\nWe see that there is a correspondence between energy and intention. It is very popular these days to use energy in a very general way to refer to all of intentions in our mind and in our spirit: we talk about mental energy, and about spiritual energy. Many people confuse these: they conflate spiritual energy with physical energy, saying that these are just different kinds of energies. Here we can see that they correspond to each other. Swedenborg would use \u0091heat\u0092 and \u0091light\u0092 (DLW 5), and I think that the word \u0091energy\u0092 is a good general interpretation of the meaning of \u0091heat\u0092 or calor. In the top middle we have waves or field structures, where Swedenborg refers to light, but these waves are waves of energy, that are spreading out and trying to do something. We know that light is a form of energy, while Swedenborg says \u0091wisdom is the form of love\u0092 (AE 1170[6]), or \u0091intentions take form in the understanding\u0092. There are many similarities in the logical structure of the sentences which connect these first two degrees.\nFor those of you who wonder how quantum physics differs from physics that we know, I will just give a brief demonstration of how this makes a difference. Imagine someone roller-skating in a hollow. In classical physics there is a limit, not unexpectedly called the \u0091classical turning point\u0092, at which the kinetic energy runs out, as energy has all turned into potential energy. In quantum theory, by contrast, there is no sharp limit, since everything is based on tendencies, and is not just predetermined and rigid. If this were an electron in an atom, then it appears with a small probability even in what is called the \u0091classically forbidden region\u0092. This is extremely important in quantum physics, and gives rise to what in my mind is interesting about quantum processes. It is essential to understanding things such as transistors, where electrons tunnel through very thin layers, because if you have another dip on the right hand side then they can get through. The same thing appears with radioactive decay, because the proton or alpha particle inside a big nucleus has a big barrier which stops it getting out, but it can still tunnel out with a very small probability and therefore you get a very long lifetime, such as thousands of millions of years, but it still gets out eventually. That is one of the differences between classical and quantum physics, because there are tendencies and not just hard and fast limits. The fact of having tendencies is related to what Swedenborg tells us concerning intentions, or conatus, that produce the results without having a fixed connection between them.\nWhat I have given so far is a brief summary of the correspondence between energy and waves of quantum physics, and intention and thoughts or understanding in the mind. We should really draw the mind above the physical degree, so intention, understanding and effects produce, and correspond to, energy and wave forms.\nQuantum Field Theory\nIn quantum physics, the starting Hamiltonian is composed of kinetic and potential energy. Now the question is, where does the Hamiltonian come from? I\u0092m going to try and describe what is called quantum field theory. You may not follow the details, but it is important to my argument that physics has discovered more of what, so to speak, is \u0091behind\u0092 the Hamiltonian. When quantum physics started 70 years ago, physicists had to invent the Hamiltonian. There were various clues and tricks, and if the results came out right you knew that you were successful. But, in reality, there is some physics behind that. We now know that the potential energy part of the Hamiltonian is not just arbitrary, but comes about from what are called virtual processes. We know that the electromagnetic forces between two charged particles are not just given by Maxwell\u0092s equations, but are given by \u0091virtual photons\u0092 or \u0091gamma rays\u0092 that are exchanged. The nuclear attraction between two protons, or between a proton and a neutron is not just arbitrary, but is given by the exchange of quarks and gluons. Quarks are attracted to each other by exchanging gluons. So there is something going on \u0091behind the scenes\u0092 of what I have described so far, which produces the Hamiltonian. What are these events? Furthermore, the kinetic energy, which is to do with mass, is said by physicists to be \u0091dressed\u0092 by virtual processes. This means, for example, that a bare electron has a cloud of photons that go along with it, because it is continually emitting and receiving photons, and these photons contribute mass via their energy of their own. So even the mass and the kinetic energy are not things that are given immediately, but are also produced from behind the scenes, and appear in the Hamiltonian which contains kinetic and potential energy together.\nFigure 3: Forces from exchange of virtual particles\nI will just mention what some of these virtual processes are, as pictured in Figure 3. This is physics that has been discovered in the last 50 years: that the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles is by exchange of photons; the nuclear forces between protons and neutrons is by exchange of a gluon; the weak interaction is by exchange of \u0091heavy vector mesons\u0092 called the Z and W particles. In physics we say that there are four kinds of interactions altogether. There are these three here: electromagnetism, nuclear and weak forces; and the fourth one is gravity. So far I have not said much about gravity, but will come back to that later. The point I want to make is that all of these things are going on behind the scenes, and physicists say that these are virtual particles. They are not actually happening, but sort of \u0091virtually\u0092 happening. Then there is a challenge to us to understand what on earth is going on? The way I want you to think about it, is that these virtual processes are the means by which plans are produced. Remember I said that we have intention, understand and effects. The understanding has all these plans, but the question is: how are these plans worked out? There must be something to help these be worked out. From Swedenborg we know that all the thoughts to do with this working out come from prior levels (AC 6200). We know that the influx from the heavens is essential for us to even think, to even get our understanding working, and to operate our plans. So, what I propose to help us to understand virtual processes, is that there is another layer of three (triadic) stages as in Figure 4.\nFigure 4: Triads of virtual processes produce actual processes\nNot all of you will have understood exactly what physicists mean by field theory, but what I want to demonstrate is that, by looking at these triadic groups and postulating another prior group, we get some ideas which help us to understand quantum physics. This prior layer describes virtual processes, or potential energies, and the bottom layer is what I had to start with, which deals with the energy, the tendencies and the actual events. The point is that this new layer contains its own autonomous degree of processes, in which virtual events are produced by virtual quantum fields, starting off by what in physics is called the \u0091field Lagrangian\u0092. We don\u0092t really know where the Lagrangian comes from, so again we have the same problem, but at least we can see that the virtual processes help prepare the kinetic and potential energies, and hence help prepare the tendencies. Note that there are virtual processes appearing even if there is nothing actually happening. Even if you take the space in this room between atoms, there are still virtual processes going on. The physicists say that there is \u0091zero point energy\u0092, and that there is a \u0091physical vacuum\u0092 which consists of fluctuations of the zero-point energy. What they imply is that there are virtual fields even though there might not be particle fields, and that these virtual fields produce measurable effects.\nI want now to identify these two layers with the \u0091air\u0092 layer and the \u0091middle ether\u0092 layer of Swedenborg (LJP 320) as shown in the figure, because his middle ether is the one he said was associated with the planets and their magnetism. He knew about magnetism, and he knew about planets. The main function of virtual events is the production of electrostatic attraction & repulsion, and magnetic forces, between charged particles. We now know that magnetism does not exist by itself, and is always combined with electrostatics: we talk of electro-magnetism. So we reinterpret Swedenborg\u0092s \u0091magnetism\u0092 as that with which we know it is unified, namely electromagnetism. This looks like the middle ether. It is in the correct order, and has the correct internal structure, from Swedenborg\u0092s point of view. We have the same pattern: a principle going to causes and then to effects. We do not know where the principle comes from, but we can see that it is a principle. This is the principle that physicists have used until recently as the initial point to describe quantum field theory. They start by writing down the Lagrangian, and look at all the terms in the Lagrangian, to work out all the possible virtual processes. They work out one-step and two-step processes for these virtual events, using for example perturbation theory. Then they work out the potential and kinetic energies, and carry on with the Hamiltonian and wave functions etc. This is all just describing in a simple way what physicists do these days. A picture of this (without the words \u0091middle ether\u0092 or \u0091air\u0092, of course) would be agreeable to my colleagues at work (I have tried it out on them 13 ), so it is sensible from the physics point of view. The only thing that they find a little bit odd is that there is this strict order. There is no sort of give and take, no reciprocal interactions: I have always drawn the arrows \u0091producing\u0092 like to the right or down, so the whole business is that of influx: conditional influx. What you need to receive influx is something I don\u0092t have time to talk about: that is really another talk 14 . At least from Swedenborg we know that there is such an order.\nGravity\nWe have a middle ether, and we have air, so what about gravity? That is the thing that is missing there. Let\u0092s summarise what we know about gravity, very briefly. The best theory of gravity is Einstein\u0092s General Theory of Relativity. It is still the best theory: no-one has disproved it. Physicists are not happy with it, for reasons which I will explain, but it is still the best theory. In this theory, space and time are \u0091curved\u0092 by gravity, according to the distribution of matter. I am not going to write down Einstein\u0092s equations, but his basic idea is that the curvature of spacetime is due to the mass and energy in spacetime. There is no mention of probabilities, so it is again a classical theory. The result of this is that questions of quantum gravity are hotly discussed: the question of how to combine probabilities with the idea of curved spacetime. There have been frequent discussions of how we could possibly have in quantum gravity such a combination. For example, if space and time are somehow probabilistically generated, then how do you talk about probabilities, if we don\u0092t have a distribution of space in which to have probabilities? There must be \u0091alternatives\u0092 of some kind! I hope that if we have insight into these problems of quantum gravity from Swedenborg, then we will be able to cast some light on these fundamental problems.\nAccording to Swedenborg, if we are in the spiritual world, we know that the space and time in the spiritual world are very flexible, let\u0092s put it that way. Space depends on our mental state and our spiritual state. We know that if two people\u0092s loves are similar, then they are close together in the spiritual world. We know that the Sun, the state of the Lord in the heavens, is so different from the state of angels that it appears at an enormous distance from them, shining on them. We also know that time is very flexible in the spiritual world. It seems to be a rule that, if someone asks you to do something, and you say that you are going to do it immediately but you want to do lots of other things beforehand, you always have \u0091time\u0092 for a diversion to do whatever else you wanted to do, and then come back to what the person asked you to do. There is no clock time in the spiritual world: there is only a succession of states. You can always have many successions of states of one kind between successive states of something else, and there is not the same rate of succession in different parts. Again, we see that space and time vary according to loves.\nNow I am going to present some ideas which are not really a theory, but an attempt at a unified view of what is going on, so we can begin to see correspondences. According to Swedenborg, loves dynamically generate the geometry of space and time that we have in the spiritual world (DLW 7, TCR 29). But we know that loves correspond to energies, so let\u0092s take this sentence and translate it by correspondences into physics. We end up with the statement, that the energies dynamically generate the geometry of space and time in the physical world. This is exactly what General Relativity says. We don\u0092t really understand the connections between loves and energies, or how exactly this works, but we can see the beginnings of some ideas which may in the future generate some insights. This suggests that our layers of air and middle ether need to be extended to include what I call a prior \u0091formative\u0092 degree. This is very speculative: I am using ideas of correspondences from Swedenborg to fill in the gaps.\n1 General Principle\n"}, {"score": 2488.788, "uuid": "88b90d1f-24df-559a-898f-e8b0a0c51cbd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0204wb-75-23144", "target_hostname": "www.niam.com", "target_uri": "http://www.niam.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=112&Itemid=1&quot;&gt;Why%20Ayurveda%20Needs%20Quantum%20Mechanics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Why Ayurveda Needs <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>", "snippet": "<em>The</em> central role of <em>the</em> perceiving mind in <em>the</em> paradigm of <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em> suggests a new philosophical outlook on <em>the</em> relationship <em>between</em> <em>the</em> mind <em>and</em> <em>the</em> universe. <em>Quantum</em> <em>physics</em> reinstated <em>the</em> human mind to <em>the</em> central position it had in <em>the</em> early Vedic world concept.", "explanation": null, "document": "Why Ayurveda Needs Quantum Mechanics\nIntroduction: Back to Our Roots\nThere is an Ayurvedic adage, \u2018To ensure the longevity of a tree one must maintain its roots\u2019. The \u2018root\u2019 I wish to address is the ancient Vedic philosophical foundation of our sacred Ayurvedic tradition.\nThis article is based on the conviction that our roots have been severed and the traditional art of Ayurvedic medicine is dying--both on the subcontinent of India, the main trunk of the tree, and consequently overseas where branches of this venerable tree are trying to grow. This article may indeed seem off-base, written at a time when Ayurvedic administrators in India and around the world are celebrating major advances in the field, such as increasing numbers of students, physicians, research papers, patients, colleges, and hospitals, which all appear to reflect a resurging state of Ayurvedic medicine. We hear misguided advocates shouting at the top of their lungs, the mantra of propagation of Ayurveda. But if we view our tradition as a living organism and listen intently to the deeper layers of its pulse, it becomes evident that the original vitality of the system is waning, though this underlying condition may be masked by a steroidal blush on the surface. Our precious roots have been severed. The true essence of our philosophical foundations has been lost almost in its entirety. At best it has become little more than a collection of unanimated slokas. However, it just may be that the time is right for these roots to re-grow and once again establish Ayurveda\u2019s original connection to the Absolute which for some time has been broken. I will explain what I see to be this auspicious timing in this paper.\nThis paper is also a call for Ayurveda to regain its self-respect. In my opinion, it is one of the most tragic problems of 21th century Ayurvedic medicine that it feels compelled to solicit for legitimacy by only conducting \u201cscientific\u201d research that conforms to the parameters of Western medicine. To illustrate the absurdity that can spring from this situation, I would like to relate an incident that occurred at the National Institutes of Health in 1991.\nThe eminent Ayurvedic physician Dr. V.N. Pandey and I were invited there to present evidence for the efficacy of a certain herbal preparation in reducing the size of uterine fibroid tumors of small to medium size. After several decades of consistently positive outcomes of hundreds of his patients and those of his many colleagues, in addition to the authoritative testimony of the Ayurvedic texts, he decided to bring it to the attention to the modern world, which I facilitated. Our idea was to initially offer the preparation only to patients not in any imminent danger, who had not responded to conventional therapy and for whom there were no remaining options except major surgery. We thought the meticulous case studies presented would have sufficed to get the project started, but now modern procedures demanded that direct action of the herbal preparation on the fibroid tumor in tissue culture must first be verified in a laboratory setting. Dr. Pandey explained that Ayurvedic preparations such as this one did not work directly but rather required an interaction with the entire physiology (i.e immune, endocrine, nervous systems, etc) of the individual to be effective. Also for individuals of different prakritis, the formulation would need to be individualized. Furthermore, this Ayurvedic medicine is designed to pass through the digestive processes of metabolic transformation rather than be applied to fibroid cells in a petry dish (which is essentially what was done). The NIH lab director explained that unless a \u201cdirect effect\u201d effect could be demonstrated, not only would the project be aborted, but that plant species would be ineligible forever from further investigations in his lab. He explained this policy was the NIH\u2019s way of focusing only on plants which, by their criteria, had the most promise.\nTo no one\u2019s surprise, when the assays for direct effect were conducted nothing happened. The project failed to proceed to clinical trials of any kind. This incident exemplified how the elaborate procedures of Western reductionist science can project highly distorted conclusions, producing \u201cscientific\u201d results that are essentially non-scientific. Does not the prolific depth of Ayurvedic medicine present a coherent holistic approach that warrants an effort to work the other way round? Must we always use the scientific method of Western science before we sanctify meditation, herbal medicine, marmas or other aspects of Ayurvedic medicine? Could we not utilize so far inexplicable Ayurvedic concepts such as the Tridosha, Ojas, Ama, and Agni, to actively inspire the nature and direction of modern scientific experiments? As the tradition of Ayurvedic medicine advances into the 21st, it must recapture inner respect for its own wisdom not by inaugurating Ayurvedic schools in foreign lands or fighting for laws which permit the overseas sale of medicines, but rather by revitalizing our connection with our roots, however mystical they might be. Now that the strangeness of quantum mechanics has been discovered and accepted, there couldn\u2019t be a better time for this to happen.\nThe Early Vedic Paradigm: The Art of Healing\nThe initial phase of development of Indian medicine can be traced back to India's Indus River civilization which flourished from about 2700 to 1500 B.C. The cosmology and realizations associated with this civilization were written down as mythico-religious Sanskrit hymns in a quaternary literary achievement known as the four Vedas. Ayurveda is considered an upaveda (\u201capplied knowledge\u201d; upa-near; next to) of the latest of these, the Atharva Veda (1000-1500 B.C.) and thus its teachings considered the highest possible category of knowledge. The rational modern mind, which derives its knowledge either through intellectual reasoning or sensory observation, i.e. metaphysical or scientific method, assumes that the sublime knowledge of the Vedas must have been the result of active metaphysical speculation emerging out of an attempt to intellectualize and elevate the primitively imaginative and raw religious experiences of the Vedic rishis. This assumption is an error caused by the projection of our own modern mental processes into the very different mentality of the Vedic rishis. The higher mental processes of the ancient world were not dominantly intellectual (speculative-based) nor empiric (observation based), but rather intuitive.\nThose uniquely human inner operations, our most transcendent, most brilliant, most incomprehensible processes, are our grandest and most powerful sources of knowledge. However, to the logical reasoning mind, they have a very obscure meaning and doubtful validity. Revelation, inspiration, intuition, and instinctive insight were the foremost processes of ancient enquiry. To the logical reason of modern men revelation is a chimera, inspiration only a selection of thoughts or words wrapped in emotion, intuition a swift and obscure form of reasoning, insight a brilliant and perspicacious method of guessing. But to the Vedic mind they were not only real and familiar, but valid processes of knowing. Our Vedic predecessors held them to be the supreme means of arriving at truth. If someone were to author a true epistemology of Vedic wisdom, it would indeed place the concepts underlying the ancient words dristi, sruti, smriti, shravana, nididhyasana at the center of the analysis. Unless these ideas are appreciated, it is impossible to understand how the old rishis arrived so early in human history at knowledge which, whether accepted or denied, electrify and expand the horizons and admiration of even the most steadfast modern intellectual. How did the ancient Vedic rishis discover ultimate universal truths about reality without laboratories and scientific equipment? The Swetaswatara Upanishad gave us a clue and told us the Supreme Reality can be grasped through a \u201cpure heart, purified intellect, and purified mind\u201d (Hrida manisha manasa abhiclipto).\nThe Later Vedic Paradigm: The Science of Healing\nSo why did the mind of the ancient Vedic rishi operate so differently from the mind of the Ayurvedic healer who followed him a mere thousand years later?\nThe term \u201cparadigm\u201d is used to describe the set of experiences, beliefs and values that affect the way an individual perceives reality and responds to that perception. Paradigms are shaped both by the society\u2019s cultural ideological background and by the presuppositions in the historical foreground. A prevailing scientific paradigm determines not only what features of Nature should be observed and studied but also which questions are even acceptable to even ask. For example, our current scientific paradigm denies the possibility of time travel or non-local psychic phenomena, so therefore these concepts never even arise in the minds of most people to explain observed events. Yet the possibility of life on other galaxies is an accepted question. A paradigm is the conceptual framework and limits within which human thought and ideas evolve. A \"paradigm shift\" denotes a change in what a given society accepts and includes in its understanding of reality. This is precisely what occurred as the Vedic period was drawing to a close approximately 500 BC.\nHistorically, Vedic healers, who clearly contemplated the relationship between mind and the material universe, always understood the role of the intuitive conscious mind to be preeminent. Through insight, revelation and intuition they arrived at the truth that consciousness and matter are not fundamentally distinct but rather are two complementary aspects of one reality. \u201cCharakas\u201d are thought by some to be the general name of the wandering mendicants of this age who became expert in healing and who contributed to the early theory and practice of Ayurveda. These healers integrated their deep knowledge of the local flora and mastery of healing techniques with wisdom they gained by observing priests who specialized in sacrificial rites and the use of efficacious incantations and ceremonies to influence and control the cosmic forces. Towards the end of the Vedic period which flourished for two millennia this all-encompassing view of reality was gradually undermined and eventually got turned on its head by a materialist philosophy which denied any role of consciousness or the mind in the fundamental fabric of reality.\nTraces of materialism appear even in the earliest recordings of Indian thought. Just as the small dots of opposite color nestled within each half of the Taoist \u201cyin-yang\u201d symbol remind us of the interdependent, mutually-arising nature of opposites, the essence of materialism already existed in Vedic spiritualism. There are early Vedic references to a figure known as Brhaspati and his followers who were \u201cunbelievers\u201d. Essentially, Brhaspati espoused an early form of naturalism, which vehemently rejected the existence of a spiritual realm and the eternal nature of reality. It claimed the exclusive epistemological authority of perception. Furthermore, it attempted to explain existence in terms of the four material elements (air, fire, water and earth). This philosophy denied the existence of the Soul or anything immaterial and put forward that the world itself and all material objects of the world are real. Knowledge of reality was valid only through direct perception, and not through inference or intuition. This directly contradicts the orthodox Vedic proclamations, Brahma satyam jagan mithya (Brahman alone is real, the world is unreal) and sarvam khalvidam Brahman (all this that we see in the world is Brahman). On a slightly different note, there was also a decidedly hedonistic aspect to Indian materialistic thought. As a reaction against the ascetic and meditative practices of the religiously devout Brahmins, Indian Materialism celebrated the pleasures of the body. People began gratifying their senses with no restraint and pleasure was asserted as the highest good. Testimony to this is the Kama Sutra, a famous ancient treatise on sexual practices, usually dated to the second century A.D.\nThe spread of Indian Materialism led to the mindset that matter can be of value in itself. Materialist thought dignified the physical world and began to bring authority to the natural sciences. In fact, the Materialist emphasis on empirical validation of truth became the guiding principle of the Scientific Method which has survived to the present day. A thousand years after the emergence of Indian Materialism, John Locke would reformulate it into the beginnings of modern empiricism, which again declared the only valid knowledge humans can have is based upon sensory experience. Whereas the authority of empirical evidence carried little weight in ancient pre-Vedic and Vedic India, modern thought began to value the systematic, logical and cautious epistemology that first appeared as Indian materialist thought. This was the all important change which represented the paradigm shift of the late Vedic period.\nInterestingly, despite the lofty heights of human wisdom that was attained by these pious and contemplative seers, this undermining of Vedic spirituality was achieved with remarkable success and ease. This was because, once initiated, essentially it became a wave that over time engulfed the entire world. The methodology was to separate what hitherto had been indivisible. In the realm of healthcare, it started insidiously in the late Vedic period with categorization and codification of disease entities. The human being was described for the first time in terms of separate organs and systems. A man\u2019s organs, and the man himself, became more and more defined by his separate identity, which he vigorously preserved and protected as never before. He gradually lost his sense of connection to \u201coutside\u201d nature. This was in distinct contrast to the Vedic viewpoint wherein mankind is whole and not \u201coutside\u201d of anything. On the contrary in orthodox Vedanta since Brahman is all-encompassing, as an observer of reality, man is regarded as the mind of the universe observing itself.\nThis understanding began to fade. Codification soon resulted in the emergence of eight \u201csubspecialties\u201d of Ayurveda, including the subspecialty of psychiatry, which singled out the mind. The two famous compendiums of Ayurvedic medicine appeared, the Caraka and Sushruta Samhitas (c. 2nd century AD). The priest-healer who served as a conduit between universal and individual spirit was replaced by the either the gurukulum- or institutionally-trained Ayurvedic physician who now applied academic and ethical standards. Throughout the early AD period and middle ages, there was a fragile thread still connected to the past which acknowledged Atman and the non-material aspect of life. However more and more emphasis was placed on dietary, herbo-mineral medicines, and other physical remedies to promote health. Ritual and mantra faded from the medical mindscape.\nThe medieval period of Indian history extending from the fifth through the fifteenth century A.D. began as a time when India entered into trade contracts with many sovereign foreign lands. These included Arabia, Syria, Babylonia, and later with Rome, Greece, and Africa. Eventually, Muslims from Western Asia not only availed themselves through mutual trade of India\u2019s considerable natural riches, but began to brutally invade, conquer, loot, and annihilate its people. Muslim rule not only dramatically changed Indian culture, literature, traditions, and religion but also impacted its system of medicine. History clearly reveals that Ayurveda though assaulted, weakened and changed throughout this tumultuous millennium, preserved its philosophical roots. Like Hinduism itself, Ayurveda displays great flexibility and resilience which allowed it to adapt to the needs of the time. It adapted by pragmatically assimilating the prevailing medical system of its conquerors, Unani Tibb Medicine, into its dogma. Concurrently, for its survival, Ayurveda relinquished its remaining connection with its early Vedic mythico-magical revealed wisdom. The most important contribution of the medieval period to Ayurveda came in the form of the many Nighantus (expanded commentaries) which were written during this time in a noble attempt by the vaidyas of the time to rescue and arrange the remnants of the surviving literature and knowledge. The subject matter was distinctly practical and material--primarily the addition of many medicinal plants which were not mentioned in the earlier samhitas and treatises. The Sarangadhara Samhita (c. 13th century A.D.) describes the use of opium, mercuric oxides, and stresses the importance of physical examination and pulse interpretation in diagnosis.\nMaterialism Matures and Peaks\nBut the crescendo of the undermining of the mind came in the mid-seventeenth century with the elaboration of the dualistic philosophy of Rene Descartes, which described a complete ontological distinction between the perceived physical universe and the perceiving mind. In formulating his metaphysics Descartes had split reality into two separate realms. On the one hand there was the res extensa: the world of solid bodies extending into space and independent of human mental processes; on the other, the res cogitans, or the inner realm of the perceiving mind. Only the former was capable of consistent mathematical description and was gradually developed into the intricate mechanistic concept of reality: every phenomenon in the universe could eventually be explained in terms of natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter. Mechanism, in turn, logically leads to determinism which, thanks to Newton, says that since all phenomena can be explained entirely through the behavior of matter with physical laws, then just as surely as a billiard ball struck by a cue ball with velocity x at a 45\u00b0 angle will move in an opposite complementary 45\u00b0 angle with velocity y, all phenomena are likewise completely determined by the properties of that matter and the operations of those natural laws. The realm of the mind, in contrast, involved primarily ideas and emotions which precluded strict\nmathematical treatment. Consequently, it was removed from the mainstream of scientific thought for two centuries. Along with the rest of human thought, the original instinctive realized wisdom of Ayurveda became eroded in favor of a more evidence-based, measurement-verified, empirical method of knowledge. The Vedic \u201csvasthya-healer-social body-subjective intuitive\u201d paradigm became metamorphosed into \u201cdisease-curer-individual body-scientific objectivity\u201d of Western or modern medicine.\nNow that this insidious paradigm has been established for more than a thousand years, we find Ayurveda being propagated out into the Western world where it [materialism] is strongest. Isaac Newton\u2019s discovery of the Universal Laws of Motion in the late seventeenth century single-handedly solidified the materialist paradigm started by Brhaspati and elaborated by Descartes. The scientific revolution which treasures its objective observations and experiments was unleashed and had no rival for the next two hundred years. Scientists believed that the connection between any cause and effect could be known by discovering the natural laws which determined it. This belief that natural laws drive every phenomenon has led to modern scientist striving to find the ultimate single universal law or energy behind everything, the so-called unified \u201ctheory of everything\u201d which has eluded scientists. This obsession with cause and effect describes interactions only among material things, and has distanced us even further from including the mind or soul of conscious beings in the modern paradigm.\nThough superficially familiar with terms like Atman, Brahman, agni, prana, ojas, etc. most Western Ayurvedic \u201cpractitioners\u201d and patients despite their best intentions are limited by their conditioned minds in their ability to penetrate the true essence of Ayurveda. Therefore, one consequence of this incomplete understanding and transmission is that today there are sadly many more individuals who are certain of its invalidity than those who resonate with it. Certainly, knowledge obtained through ritual trances, prayer, and revelation would be ridiculed by many and a medical strategy based on such knowledge adopted by few modern patients. But there is another far more troubling consequence: modern Ayurvedic physicians have lost their connection to their original Vedic roots. To the modern Ayurvedist it seems irrelevant to ponder the mysteries of consciousness or mythical imagery from a distant past. Our time is better spent memorizing plant genera and practical treatment protocols.\nBut whatever the validity or the lack of it attached to these ancient methods of knowing, only by somehow reproducing the ancient Vedic process and re-discovering its original starting-point can we recover also what, to the intellect, is hopelessly obscure in Ayurveda and Vedanta.\nThe ancients were not at all concerned with documenting in literal and explicit language their observations of the physical world for posterity as we do today. Their concern was the vast movement of consciousness and the oneness of micro and macrocosm; and the eternal character of the cosmos is what adds an ageless quality to the language of their hymns. That language holds the key to deciphering what appears at first to be cryptic and obtuse writings. However, we must also bear in mind that the Vedas are not textbooks or user manuals. They are collections of prayers and hymns in an impressionistic language whose multi-dimensions are largely ignored today. But in the Vedic Age this language was universal and required no interpretation. To make a connection with that ancient culture, we do not necessarily need to live the exact same inner experience or speak the same ancient language. However, we will be required to leave aside the methods of modern intellectual scholarship for a while, as well as all our conditioned preferences and weltanschauung. If we want those symbols of another age to speak to us once again we will need to accept a new, expanded paradigm of reality.\nBy analogy, if we know of the existence of a lost treasure, but have not a single clue to its exact whereabouts, we could never find it; but if we have a clue, however enigmatic, left behind by the original owners, we can decipher its meaning, set out in the right direction and recover the long lost wealth. What\u2019s more, we do not necessarily need to retrace the exact original steps to arrive at the destination; we may take an entirely different path to get back there. We probably can\u2019t recover ancient Ayurvedic revelations thru primitive Vedic mythico-religious hymns, sacrifices, rituals, etc. or through the intellectual mind. Technology and cultural barriers have now irreversibly developed and become embedded in the fabric of modern life; civilization\u2019s prevailing paradigm is now much more complex.\nUntil recently there was no discernable way back\u2026until the emergence in the early 1900\u2019s of quantum physics\u2026\nQuantum Mechanics\nOne of the earliest and greatest fundamental discoveries of Ayurveda was the Law of Uniformity of Nature or Loka-Purusa-Samanya (CS Sa. 5.1): puruso\u2019 yam lokasammitah---which followed from observations of the intimate relationships between the micro- and macrocosms. It says that the same universal laws which operate on the largest scales of Nature are identical with those at the most minute scales. Minute observations of Nature and its phenomena have opened the doors to theories about gravitation, thermodynamics, electricity, magnetism, and life itself. But it was in our unbridled zeal to use technology and look ever more closely at Nature in a quest to discover the smallest, most fundamental particle of matter that science inadvertently and unwillingly stumbled upon the realm of quantum physics.\nAs the Middle Ages ended knowledge about natural phenomena was rapidly increasing. One remaining debate about the wave vs. particle nature of light was apparently finally settled by Isaac Newton (1642-1727) who had authoritative arguments that light was a stream of minute particles. Here were some of his points. Firstly, light travels in a straight line, like bullets, unless interrupted by some intervening object; second, light reflects off a mirror at the exact angle at which it hits; thirdly when light bounces off an irregular surface it scatters widely; and finally light travels through the vacuum of space from the sun to reach earth. Waves require a medium in which to propagate, particles do not; therefore light cannot be a wave and must be corpuscular. The particle theory of light persisted for more than100 years until Thomas Young\u2019s famous double-slit experiment which he conducted in 1803.\nThe Double-slit Experimen\nIf light travels as particles we can imagine particles of light (photons) as bullets fired from a rifle. Imagine a wall with two holes in it, each the same size and just large enough for the bullets to fit through, with a second wall behind where the bullets will strike. After firing a few rounds you would expect to see on the second wall two clusters of hits in line with the two holes. This is of course precisely what you get with bullets, so if we get the same result with photons we can say they are particles.\nNow, with the same setup, imagine that instead of particles, that light travels as a wave. The wave would reach both holes at the same time and each hole would then act as a new source. Waves would then spread out again from each of the two holes, exactly in phase, and as the waves moved forward, spreading as they go, they would eventually interfere with one another. Imagine for a moment these were water waves. Where both waves are lifting the water surface upward, we get an additive effect and a more pronounced crest; where one wave is cresting and the other is troughing the two cancel out and the water level is undisturbed. The effects are called constructive and destructive interference.\nNow similarly with light waves, the pattern on the second wall would appear as an interference pattern of alternate light and dark bands across the wall. Particles, on the other hand, would produce two separate areas of light (where the bullets would hit). This experiment has in fact been carried out many, many times, with the same results every time, and the results are nothing less than amazing. Here\u2019s why\u2026\nWhen the experiment is set up as shown in the above diagram, with both slits open, the resulting interference pattern clearly shows that light behaves as a wave. Now if that was all there was to it we could say \u2018case closed\u2019 and conclude that light travels as a wave; but there is much more to it than that. This is where the word 'weird' will no doubt occur to you.\nIf the experiment, still with both holes open, is set up to fire individual photons, so that only one photon at a time goes through the set up, we would not expect the same interference pattern to build up; we would surely expect that a single photon would only go through one hole or another, it cannot go through both at the same time and create an interference pattern. So what happens?\nIf we wait until enough (millions) individual photons have passed through to build up a pattern, we do not get two bullet-like clusters opposite the two holes, we get the wave-like interference pattern! It is as if each individual photon 'knows' that both holes are open and gives that result. Each individual photon, passing through the set up will place itself on the second wall in such a position that when enough have passed through they have collectively built up an interference pattern, when there cannot possibly be any interference!\nIf we repeat the experiment, this time with only one hole open, the individual photons behave again like bullets and all cluster round a point on the detector screen directly behind the open hole, just as expected. However, as soon as the second hole is opened they again immediately start to form an interference pattern. An individual photon passing through one of the holes is not only aware of the other hole, but also aware of whether or not it is open! We could try peeking, to see which hole the photon goes through, and to see if it goes through both holes at once, or if half a photon goes through each hole. When detectors are placed at the holes to record the passage of electrons through each of the holes, the result is even more bizarre.\nImagine an arrangement that records which hole a photon goes through but lets it pass on its way to the detector screen. Now the photons behave like normal, everyday particles. We always see a photon at one hole or the other, never both at once, and now the pattern that builds up on the detector screen is exactly equivalent to the pattern for bullets, with no trace of interference. Strangely, we do not need to even place detectors at both holes; we get the same result by watching just one hole. If a photon passes through a hole that does not have a detector, it not only knows if the other hole is open or not, it knows if the other hole is being observed! With no detector at the either hole, it will produce an interference pattern (wave), otherwise, with detectors at either one or both holes, it will act as a particle.\nSummary:\n\uf0b7 When we are watching the holes, we never catch the photon going through both at once--it will only go through one or the other, like particles.\n\uf0b7 When we are not watching the holes, the photon goes through both simultaneously, like a wave!\nSomehow the interaction of the observer with the experiment affects the observed result. When we try to look at the spread-out photon wave, it collapses into a definite particle, but when we are not looking it keeps its spread out wavy nature. Weird!\nWhat the double-slit experiment demonstrates is this: Each photon starts out as a single photon - a particle - and arrives at the detector on the second wall as a particle, but appears to have gone through both holes at once, interfered with itself, and worked out just where to place itself on the detector to make its own small contribution to the overall interference pattern. This observation raises a number of significant problems! Does the photon go through both holes at the same time? How can a single photon go through two holes at the same time? How does it \u201cknow\u201d where to go on the detector to form part of the overall pattern?\nPerhaps the bizarre experimental results are due to the unusual properties of photons themselves. After all photons are massless ephemeral objects and might have other hitherto undiscovered strange properties. However, it turns out electrons have been used instead of photons, and they not only have mass, they have an electric charge, and even move at different speeds depending on circumstances, much like normal everyday objects. The double-slit experiments still gives the same result using electrons as it does using photons; electrons also alter their behavior depending on whether or not they are being observed. The experiment has even been performed using atoms and even small molecules large enough to be individually photographed, again with the same result. These are very real solid objects and this odd behavior of particles is a very real phenomenon.\nThe Return of the Mind\nThese next two paragraphs are the hardest to grasp in this entire article so prepare yourself. The currently accepted interpretation for quantum weirdness concerns the nature of the wave that is passing through the experiment. The key concept of the theory, which forms a central part of the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics, is known as the 'collapse of the wave function'. The theory seeks to explain how an entity such as a photon or an electron, could 'travel as a wave but arrive as a particle'. According to the theory, what is passing through the holes in a double-slit experiment is not a normal material wave at all, but is a 'probability wave'. In other words, the particle does not have a definite location, but has a probability of being here or there, or somewhere else entirely. Some locations will be more probable than others, such as the light areas in the interference pattern for example, and some will be less probable, such as in the dark areas.\nIn this theory, an electron that is not being observed does not exist as a particle at all, but has a wave-like property covering all the areas of probability where it could be found. Until it is observed, it exists simultaneously in two or more places at the same time! The technical quantum mechanical term for this is that the electron is in a \u201csuperposition state\u201d. Once the electron is observed, the \u2018wave function collapses\u2019 into a single location and the electron becomes a particle. Mathematically, \u2018collapse\u2019 means that the probability becomes \u2018one\u2019 for a single location and \u2018zero\u2019 for all others. This theory elegantly explains the behavior of the particles in the double-slit experiment. When we are not looking at the particle, the probability wave, of even a single particle, is spread out and will pass through both slits at the same time and arrive at the detector as a wave showing an interference pattern. When we observe the electron by placing detectors at the slits, it is forced into revealing its location which causes the probability wave to collapse into a particle. If the theory is correct, its implications are staggering. What it suggests is that nothing is real until it has been consciously observed!\nNothing is real until it has been consciously observed! Are we really saying that until a thing has been observed it doesn't exist? This is precisely what the Copenhagen Interpretation is telling us about reality. The central role of the perceiving mind in the paradigm of quantum physics suggests a new philosophical outlook on the relationship between the mind and the universe. Quantum physics reinstated the human mind to the central position it had in the early Vedic world concept. This has caused philosophers and some scientists to ponder the cosmological implications. This could imply that there must actually be something 'outside' the known universe to observe it as a whole and collapse its overall wave function. Another argument that it is in fact the conscious observation of living beings that has collapsed the wave function and brought the universe into existence. If we take this to be true, then the universe only exists because we are looking at it. But if you\u2019ve read this far maybe you\u2019ve already guessed: this is not quite the end of the story, though it took another eighty years after Thomas\u2019s double-slit extravaganza.\nWhat's the photoelectric effect?\nIn 1887 Heinrich Hertz determined experimentally that when light shines on a metal surface, it\u2019s surface emits electrons. In fact you can actually start an electric current in a circuit just by shining a light on a metal plate. How does this happen? When light hits electrons in the atoms of the metal\u2019s surface, it can transfer enough energy to knock some of these electrons out of its atoms.\nHistorically, light had been viewed by some as a particle rather than a wave; Newton, as we\u2019ve said,\nthought of light this way. However this particle view was pretty much discredited with Thomas Young's double-slit experiment, which demonstrated that light had to be a wave. But in the early 20th century, some physicists--Einstein, for one\u2014began to consider the particle view of light again. Einstein used the photoelectric effect to understand whether light consists of particles or waves.\nIt may at first seem that the photoelectric effect would still occur no matter which view is correct. Either way, the light would carry energy, so it would be able to knock electrons around. But the details of the photoelectric effect are completely different depending on whether light consists of particles or waves.\nIf light is a wave, then the energy contained in one of those waves should depend only on its amplitude--that is, on the intensity (brightness) of the light. The light\u2019s frequency (color), should make no difference. So, for example, red light and ultraviolet light of the same intensity should knock out the same number of electrons, and the maximum kinetic energy of both sets of electrons should also be the same. Decrease the intensity (brightness), and you should get fewer electrons, flying out more slowly; if the light is too faint, you shouldn't get any electrons at all, no matter what frequency you're using.\nThat may sound reasonable enough to you at this point. Now let\u2019s see how the effect change would if we assume that light is made of particles.\nFirst we need to briefly understand the work of Max Planck...\nIn 1900, Max Planck was working on the problem of how the radiation an object emits is related to its temperature. He came up with a formula that agreed very closely with experimental data, but the formula only made sense if he assumed that the energy of a vibrating molecule was quantized--that is, it could only take on certain discreet values in discreet steps. The energy emitted was found to be proportional to the frequency of vibration, and it seemed to come in little \"chunks\" of the frequency multiplied by a certain constant. This constant came to be known as Planck's constant, or h, and it has the value 6.62606957(29)\u00d710\u221234 joule sec., an extremely small but important value.\nPlanck actually didn't realize how revolutionary his work was at the time but Albert Einstein did. Einstein proposed that not only radiation but light also delivers its energy in chunks. Einstein proposed that light consists of little particles, or quanta, later named photons, each with an energy equal to Planck's constant times its frequency, E=hf.\nSo in the case of light being photon particles, the frequency of the light would make a difference in the photoelectric effect. Higher-frequency photons have more energy, so they should make the electrons come flying out faster. Now keeping the intensity (brightness) of the light the same but using a higher frequency (color) should increase the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons. But if you leave the frequency the same but crank up the intensity, more electrons should come out (because there are more photons to hit them), but they won't come out any faster, because each individual photon still has the same energy. And if the frequency is low enough, then none of the photons will have enough energy to knock an electron out of an atom. So if you use really low-frequency light, you shouldn't get any electrons, no matter how high the intensity is. Whereas if you use a high frequency, you should still knock out some electrons even if the intensity is very low, i.e. very dim!\nWhich way did it turn out?\nFrequency and not intensity is the important factor. In 1913 R.A. Millikan in a series of extremely meticulous experiments proved that Einstein's predictions about light being composed of photon particles were correct. The extraordinary fact that the ejection energy was independent of the total energy of illumination (i.e. intensity) showed that the effect must be due to a particle which gave all of its energy to the electron! (Einstein actually won the Nobel Prize for his work on the photoelectric effect, not for his more famous theory of relativity)\nBut if light is made of particles what about the double-slit experiment? It proves beyond all possible doubt that light consists of waves. Depending on which experiment you choose to do, you can prove light to be either particles (photoelectric experiment) or waves (double-slit experiment).\nThus was quantum mechanics born from this conundrum and from the ensuing research of Einstein, Planck, de Broglie, Bohr, Schr\u00f6dinger, Bell and others who attempted to explain how electromagnetic radiation can exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior. Precisely because quantum mechanics leads to irrefutably proven yet outrageously counter-intuitive and illogical conclusions that it has perhaps perfectly prepared the world for the true renaissance of Ayurveda. In order to change a prevailing scientific paradigm as entrenched as classical materialistic worldview, we need evidence powerful and earth-shattering enough to create sufficient cognitive dissonance to admit the possibility of another entirely different worldview. Once also counter-intuitive, we no longer believe that the sun and planets revolve around the earth or that the earth is flat. In September 2011 there was even a preliminary report from the esteemed CERN laboratory of an object\u2014a muon neutrino\u2014moving faster than the speed of light, which for 100 years has been held to be an immutable, unsurpassable constant (final confirmation may take several years). Perhaps the time has come, thanks to quantum mechanics, when we will no longer fear the mockery and disdain of the rational materialists as we open our minds once again to the validity of the original intuitive revelations and insights of Ayurveda.\nQuantum Entanglement\nThere is another aspect of quantum mechanics which has equally astonishing implications.\nAtoms can be raised to an excited state from which they quickly return to their ground state in two successive quantum jumps and in so doing, they release two photons. These two \u201ctwin photons\u201d will fly off in different directions but will always have the same polarization (i.e. both vertical, both horizontal, etc.) when they are measured. Until the polarization is actually measured, photons have no polarization. Now if one photon from a twin pair is measured and found to have vertical polarization, its twin\u2014though it could be many miles away or even in another galaxy\u2014will exhibit the same polarization, even though the second photon could not have possibly received any information about the polarization of the first photon. Twin pair photons are entangled in a state of identical polarization but do not have any particular polarization unless and until one of them is measured. Prior to measurement, the polarization of both photons is identical but in a superposition state. Measurement of one of the separated pairs instantaneously collapses both photons to the same polarization.\nIf the objects are indeterminate until one of them is measured, then the question becomes, \"How can we account for an initially indefinite direction of polarization in twin #2 suddenly becoming definite in concert with twin #1 even though no physical interaction between them occurred, and which are sufficiently separated that there was not even sufficient time, if we take c, the speed of light to be a limit, for such an interaction to proceed from the first to the second object?\" The answer to the latter question is counterintuitive, breathtaking, and also repeated proven to be true. We\u2019ve stated it above but it bears repeating. Twin pair photons do not have any specific polarization or any property until one of them is consciously observed. It is the observation of the polarization of one to be, say, vertically polarized that instantaneously collapses both photons to that same vertical polarization. This leads to two irrefutable conclusions:\nOne\u2014the properties and behavior of a single member of a photon twin-pair is spontaneously connected to its twin. This applies not only to photons but to any two objects that have ever interacted; they are eternally entangled and will have mutual influence on each other\u2019s behavior. By the way, this entanglement even exists if two objects have a common interaction with a third object. Thus it points to a universal connectedness reminiscent of that spoken of in the Vedas.\nTwo-- that there is no physical reality to any physical property until it is consciously observed.\nQuantum Mechanics and the Tanmatras\nIn almost all modern textbooks detailing the philosophical origins of Ayurveda darshan, we find a few paragraphs outlining the Samkhya philosophy. Texts commonly include a flow diagram of the 24 tattvas revealing the procession of the creation from immaterial to material, from Purusha (Spirit) to the Panchamahabhutas (Matter). The five Tanmatras appear in the procession as the final immaterial element immediately preceding and creating the five material gross elements.\nIt is here, in the attempts to explain to movement from Tanmatra to Mahabhuta that modern authors\u2019 voices suddenly become silent. For modern authors of Ayurveda know nothing of this moment where consciousness acquires the appearance of a material substance; where the microcosmic realm of Spirit, Thought, and Ideas are transformed into the mundane, solid, tangible macroscopic realm of material objects. That the interface of the Tanmatras and Mahabhutas was an important and mysterious process is clear from its consideration in ancient Vedic texts such as the Brahmanda Purana:\nMano rupeksu kodanda panchatanmatra sayaka \u201cMind is the bow which launches the arrows as five Tanmatras\u201d\nThe Tanmatras are the contribution of the conscious mind to material reality. Quantum mechanics shines its light on this mystifying boundary where we are learning that these two apparently distinct realities are truly one. The external world is a fabrication, a combining, not only of particles and waves, but of realities. The mind creates Maya. It paints the image of a material world upon the canvas of Brahman, the unfathomable eternal substratum of everything. The illusion of Maya is slowly dissolving as quantum mechanics leads us toward the integration of mind, matter, events, consciousness, thought and intuition into one ultimate source.\nConclusion\nThousands of years ago the ancient Vedic priests and Ayurvedic healers realized the fundamental truth that the entire universe is one, interconnected life interpenetrated by the ultimate reality which they named Brahman. Perhaps the most central Vedic teaching is that everything including all human beings are born from Brahman which manifests its connection with us in the form of our individual atman. Their insights were eventually recorded in the Vedas and the essence of these realizations more cogently expressed in the Upanishads. In the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad the sage Yajnavalkya declares \u201cThat Reality, O Gargi, has interpenetrated the whole universe.\u201d The Munduka Upanishad begins with a student\u2019s question to his guru: \u201cBy what, O adorable Sir, having become known, all this is known?\u201d A lengthy series of questions repeatedly seeking kasmin (by what) is steadfastly answered by the emphatic assertion yasmin (by That)\u2014which is Brahmin. Quantum mechanics, specifically its entanglement feature, gives scientific credence to the interconnection between Brahmin and all life forms. Everything that can be apprehended is but one part of a single universal entity. We needed quantum mechanics to be discovered by Humankind to shake off our materialist paradigm and re-mind us of this. Brahmin has always been described as the pure, uninvolved Witness to the creation. Quantum mechanics verifies the universal creative implications of the observer. Perhaps now a new non-denominational version of the bible could be re-written in light of the convergence of Quantum-Vedic wisdom outlined in this paper. It could be called The Tentative Gospel According to Quantum Veda. It could begin, \u201cIn the beginning there was the probability wave. And it was Brahmin\u201d. And from there, it would be only a small step back to our Ayurvedic roots.\n\u00a9 The National Institute Of Ayurvedic Medicine.All Rights Reserved.\n"}, {"score": 2488.6174, "uuid": "72b145bc-db39-588d-af7e-f81813475aad", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0001wb-17-16113", "target_hostname": "highermeaning.org", "target_uri": "http://highermeaning.org/Authors/IJT/qps-art3.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "Are <em>QUANTUM</em> <em>PHYSICS</em> <em>and</em> SPIRITUALITY related", "snippet": "That <em>is</em> one of <em>the</em> <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> classical <em>and</em> <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em>, because there are tendencies <em>and</em> not just hard <em>and</em> fast limits.", "explanation": null, "document": "E.H. Walker 6\nFigure 1: Suggested means for getting one definite actuality\nThose of you that have read some popular physics will recognise some of these alternatives, and they are all designed to answer the same measurement problem. The first suggestion is called Everett\u0092s many-worlds interpretation, in which there is not any real selection, but all alternatives occur the same time, for example in some set of parallel universes. The second theory of \u0091decoherence\u0092 says that it really like that, but that it appears to a good approximation as if only one outcome occurs. Niels Bohr thought it was the fact that experimental apparatus was \u0091classical\u0092, with no wave behaviour, that gives rise to a particular outcome. We now know that quantum physics applies to the experimental apparatus as well, so that does not really solve the problem. Werner Heisenberg, Eugene Wigner and Henry Stapp have in turn introduced the speculation that selection is something to do with consciousness or mind, and this has given rise to a whole stream of suggestions in which consciousness (or something) has become more and more involved in trying to solve the problem of quantum physics.\nWigner in a paper of 40 years ago suggested that it was the consciousness of the observing scientist, and this idea has been carried on by Stapp, who says that consciousness is actually involved in the brain. Stapp believes that since a quantum brain has many alternate things that can happen, consciousness selects one of these outcomes to produce a result. I have listed other alternatives here, which get progressively more \u0091way out\u0092. A few of these ideas we can imagine being true, for example that \u0091spirit produces nature\u0092, but some people have gone even further than that, and have said that nature is somehow essentially spiritual \u0096 that it is connected with, or equal to, the spiritual. Others have continued this theme to say that quantum physics is a way of learning about spirituality, a way to regain our spirituality. There is a great range of possible solutions here that try to solve the same problem: how something that is described by a wave can produce a definite outcome. The trouble starts from the fact that when physicists think about nature, they only have two ideas in mind: they can think of a wave or a particle 7 . The difficulty is that the objects which quantum physics tells us are in nature are not just waves, and not just particles, so the challenge is to find a new understanding and a new picture.\nAs well as the more extreme ideas above, there are further ideas that have been proposed. James Jeans, the mathematical physicist, wrote 8 about 60 years ago that \u0093the wave function looks like not something solid and substantial, but looks more like an \u0091idea\u0092\u0094. Some (e.g. Zohar 9 ) have taken this to mean that quantum physics tells us about ideas. Others, discussing the putative identity of spirit and nature, have tried to work out various ways for why they appear to be different. They have said that perhaps spirit and nature are different grades of energies, different frequencies, different dimensions, and/or different \u0091fineness\u0092 of material. Those of us with backgrounds from Swedenborg will recognise that suggesting \u0091different dimensions\u0092 here is trying to use spatial analogies (thinking from ideas of space) to distinguish mind from nature. When people try to talk about \u0091different frequencies\u0092, they are using temporal analogies to think about this difference. But we know from Swedenborg that we cannot really use either of these kinds of analogies (TCR 30).\nFrom Swedenborg we think we know which of all the above ideas make sense, that is, which of them could possibly be true. Let us point out which ones these might be, before discussing which ones are true. We know that choosing to do one particular thing cannot be just an illusion, because otherwise it would make a mockery of trying to order one\u0092s life. We know that particular outcomes are chosen, so that it cannot really just be a good approximation that selections do occur. We know that consciousness is perhaps involved. It is not ruled out, because we know from Swedenborg that spirit produces nature, and it may be that consciousness, as part of spirit, is involved. But we know that the last three ideas (9-11) cannot be true, because we know that there is an essential difference between nature and spirit, which means that we have to find a different kind of connection between quantum physics and spirituality, that is not just identity. There must be another kind of connection. Of the next set of ideas, we know that distinctions based on time or dimensions cannot be true. We know that the true distinction is not based on \u0091fineness\u0092 or \u0091subtlety\u0092: Swedenborg has comments to make about that (HH 38, TCR 280). It may be true that the wave function looks like an idea, but that is only true if we take the word \u0091like\u0092 to refer to correspondence rather than to be just equal.\nMultiple Levels\nAll of the above is a very brief and necessarily cursory introduction to how we can use Swedenborg to understand modern physics. I am going to discuss the existence of \u0091multiple generative levels\u0092 or \u0091discrete levels\u0092. Swedenborg makes a great effort to distinguish discrete from continuous levels (HH 38, DLW 184ff), and what I want to show is that there are discrete levels within the natural, that is, within quantum physics. This will help us to understand what is going on in physics. Furthermore, these discrete levels within the natural will correspond to other discrete levels we know about within spiritual processes. Thus, we have this triadic structure within the natural, as well as within the spiritual, and these are linked together by correspondences. This is the overall theme for what follows.\nIf we recapitulate what Swedenborg tells us about how spirit and nature are combined, and if we look at what Swedenborg said after he was told what was actually happening rather than what he tried to guess at in his earlier years, which is quite different, then we see that he later in his life learned that the spirit is an essential means in the creation of nature. Nature is not created immediately from the Infinite, but is created by means of the spirit. He came to see that the natural world is a final effect of causes working in the spiritual world, which themselves manifest certain forms of love. So, as a consequence, this pattern of love > wisdom > effect is the pattern that we can try to use to understand what is happening in quantum physics.\nThis pattern can be summarised in many ways: love > wisdom > effect; or soul > mind > body, as the same triadic pattern. Swedenborg gives us ample reason to show that this is repeated in the soul: we have celestial, spiritual and spiritual-natural. It is repeated in the mind: we have an interior rational, an exterior natural, and a sensory mind. So the question is, it is also repeated in the natural world?\nSwedenborg has a variety of things to say about degrees in the natural world (see e.g Hugo Lj. Odhner\u0092s article 10 ). When Swedenborg started, he had quite a few different ideas that varied from book to book. I am going to talk about his \u0091ethers\u0092, which is something about which he changed his mind a number of times, also concerning how they are related to the spiritual world 11 . If we read from Last Judgement (Posthumous),\n\u0093the three natural atmospheres arising from the sun of the world are the purer ether, which is universal, from which is all gravitation; the middle ether, which forms the vortex around the planets, in which are the moons and the satellites, from which is magnetism; and the ultimate ether which is the air.\u0094 (LJP 320)\nThis is where he talks about three degrees in nature. These days, we don\u0092t believe in \u0091ether\u0092, but the question is whether we can interpret what he says about purer, middle, and ultimate ethers in such a way that makes sense. I am going to assume that these three adjectives refer to different kinds of ethers. He might not have known from the scientific point of view what they were, but they certainly appear to be three different things, and certainly not three different vacuums 12 . But do we recognise this pattern? Does it make sense to us? We have to allow some flexibility in the interpretation of what he meant by ether, but he does tell us what are the functions of these three ethers. He tells us that the first one is to do with gravity, the middle one is to do with magnetism, and the final one is to do with material things. Do those descriptions make sense?\nLet us try and work out what three degrees in the natural might be, if we use New Church principles to work out a priori what those degrees might be expected to consist of. From the correspondences of the natural with the three degrees in the spiritual, then in the natural there must be (a) a way of receiving in the body the intentions of the spirit, furthermore there must be (b) a propagation of causes within the natural, and there must be (c) a way of producing effects in the natural. We can think of these as ends, cause, and effects, all in the natural. This is what we expect to see from Swedenborg\u0092s point of view. Is there a way of looking at the natural that we know about from science, in which we see these three degrees?\nIn modern physics we do not know anything about ends; in fact we deliberately refuse to consider ends in physics, as a rule. But we know a great deal about the propagation of causes in physics: that is what physics does extremely well. It tells us how causes propagate through sequences and the various changes produced. And in physics we know some little about effects. In fact, the irony is that the whole business I talked about earlier, of getting a definite outcome in quantum physics, is precisely because physics does not know enough about the actual effects. So it is clear that contemporary physics knows a lot about propagation of causes, and it knows almost everything about the production of effects, though there is still something missing from what quantum physics tells about the final effects. Thus, if Swedenborg has any light to cast on what these three degrees are, it should help fill in an important lacuna, a noticeable gap in quantum physics, which is the production of effects.\nEnergy\nIf we look at physics, and at what physics regards as part of its central understanding, the important idea in physics is energy. Energy is the theme that goes through contemporary physics. It talks about potential energy, and about kinetic energy: kinetic energy is energy to do with motion, and potential energy is to do with what would happen if the circumstances were right. In classical physics we can go a long way by knowing about conservation of energy (as well as conservation of momentum, angular momentum etc). Energy in quantum physics, the total of the kinetic and potential energies, is converted into what is called the Hamiltonian operator (normally abbreviated H). I will just say that this operator enters into the Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation, which governs all quantum wave forms. It thus generates all fields of probabilities, and hence all time evolution. All of the dynamics in quantum physics is specified by knowing what the initial state is, and what the Hamiltonian operator is. So, energy in some form is very important in both classical and quantum physics.\nThus, whenever I do quantum physics as part of my job in nuclear physics, I first try and find the Hamiltonian, then I solve Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nHY(x,t) = i\u00b6Y(x,t)/\u00b6 t.\nHere, the Hamiltonian H is an operator acting on the wave function which tells us how the wave function changes, by means of the derivative of the wave function with respect to time on the right hand side of the equation. In this way, the Hamiltonian determines all the dynamics, as we can solve this equation to find the wave function at all places x and times t into the future. The central equation in quantum physics is an equation of this form (perhaps the Schr\u00f6dinger or the Dirac equation), which always has a time derivative which tells how the wave function varies with time. Furthermore, once we have this wave function, we can find probabilities by taking its square modulus |Y(x,t)|2. The question is now, do we see a triad of end > cause > effect in this structure? I have just described the structure of quantum physics as every atomic physicist, every nuclear physicist practices it. Do we see the triad there? I claim that we do, if we look properly.\nFigure 2: Correspondences of Quantum and Mental Processes\nThree Quantum Degrees\nI claim that that there are three things. To help you understand, at the bottom of Figure 2, I have drawn the correspondences to what they are in the mind. Those of you that know quantum physics can look up at the top, and those that know Swedenborg can look at the bottom, and then I want to make a connection between these. If you know one, these connections will help you understand the other. Thus, looking again at quantum physics, we have the Hamiltonian which is to do with total energy, which is somehow active, since it is an operator which operates on the wave function and changes it. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is the rule for how the Hamiltonian operator produces what we can call the \u0091tendency wave\u0092: a wave function which is a form of propensities or tendencies for action: a probability wave. Then this wave function (in fact its squared modulus) gives a probability for different outcomes. This is the structure of quantum physics, and in this structure we now see the same kind of structure of triadic degrees that we have in our minds. At the bottom of Figure 2 is a very simple triad from psychology. If we look just in our external mind, then we have intention, thinking about plans, both leading to action. This is the corresponding triad to the processes in quantum physics (of course, not the same triad). From Swedenborg we know about love > wisdom > use (or affection > understanding > decision, or celestial > spiritual > natural) and we have in general correspondences to all these triads. We know that the same pattern repeats itself in the whole, and in each part. I am talking about every single process for every single particle in quantum physics: every time any smallest thing evolves in time, we see the same triadic pattern.\nWe see that there is a correspondence between energy and intention. It is very popular these days to use energy in a very general way to refer to all of intentions in our mind and in our spirit: we talk about mental energy, and about spiritual energy. Many people confuse these: they conflate spiritual energy with physical energy, saying that these are just different kinds of energies. Here we can see that they correspond to each other. Swedenborg would use \u0091heat\u0092 and \u0091light\u0092 (DLW 5), and I think that the word \u0091energy\u0092 is a good general interpretation of the meaning of \u0091heat\u0092 or calor. In the top middle we have waves or field structures, where Swedenborg refers to light, but these waves are waves of energy, that are spreading out and trying to do something. We know that light is a form of energy, while Swedenborg says \u0091wisdom is the form of love\u0092 (AE 1170[6]), or \u0091intentions take form in the understanding\u0092. There are many similarities in the logical structure of the sentences which connect these first two degrees.\nFor those of you who wonder how quantum physics differs from physics that we know, I will just give a brief demonstration of how this makes a difference. Imagine someone roller-skating in a hollow. In classical physics there is a limit, not unexpectedly called the \u0091classical turning point\u0092, at which the kinetic energy runs out, as energy has all turned into potential energy. In quantum theory, by contrast, there is no sharp limit, since everything is based on tendencies, and is not just predetermined and rigid. If this were an electron in an atom, then it appears with a small probability even in what is called the \u0091classically forbidden region\u0092. This is extremely important in quantum physics, and gives rise to what in my mind is interesting about quantum processes. It is essential to understanding things such as transistors, where electrons tunnel through very thin layers, because if you have another dip on the right hand side then they can get through. The same thing appears with radioactive decay, because the proton or alpha particle inside a big nucleus has a big barrier which stops it getting out, but it can still tunnel out with a very small probability and therefore you get a very long lifetime, such as thousands of millions of years, but it still gets out eventually. That is one of the differences between classical and quantum physics, because there are tendencies and not just hard and fast limits. The fact of having tendencies is related to what Swedenborg tells us concerning intentions, or conatus, that produce the results without having a fixed connection between them.\nWhat I have given so far is a brief summary of the correspondence between energy and waves of quantum physics, and intention and thoughts or understanding in the mind. We should really draw the mind above the physical degree, so intention, understanding and effects produce, and correspond to, energy and wave forms.\nQuantum Field Theory\nIn quantum physics, the starting Hamiltonian is composed of kinetic and potential energy. Now the question is, where does the Hamiltonian come from? I\u0092m going to try and describe what is called quantum field theory. You may not follow the details, but it is important to my argument that physics has discovered more of what, so to speak, is \u0091behind\u0092 the Hamiltonian. When quantum physics started 70 years ago, physicists had to invent the Hamiltonian. There were various clues and tricks, and if the results came out right you knew that you were successful. But, in reality, there is some physics behind that. We now know that the potential energy part of the Hamiltonian is not just arbitrary, but comes about from what are called virtual processes. We know that the electromagnetic forces between two charged particles are not just given by Maxwell\u0092s equations, but are given by \u0091virtual photons\u0092 or \u0091gamma rays\u0092 that are exchanged. The nuclear attraction between two protons, or between a proton and a neutron is not just arbitrary, but is given by the exchange of quarks and gluons. Quarks are attracted to each other by exchanging gluons. So there is something going on \u0091behind the scenes\u0092 of what I have described so far, which produces the Hamiltonian. What are these events? Furthermore, the kinetic energy, which is to do with mass, is said by physicists to be \u0091dressed\u0092 by virtual processes. This means, for example, that a bare electron has a cloud of photons that go along with it, because it is continually emitting and receiving photons, and these photons contribute mass via their energy of their own. So even the mass and the kinetic energy are not things that are given immediately, but are also produced from behind the scenes, and appear in the Hamiltonian which contains kinetic and potential energy together.\nFigure 3: Forces from exchange of virtual particles\nI will just mention what some of these virtual processes are, as pictured in Figure 3. This is physics that has been discovered in the last 50 years: that the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles is by exchange of photons; the nuclear forces between protons and neutrons is by exchange of a gluon; the weak interaction is by exchange of \u0091heavy vector mesons\u0092 called the Z and W particles. In physics we say that there are four kinds of interactions altogether. There are these three here: electromagnetism, nuclear and weak forces; and the fourth one is gravity. So far I have not said much about gravity, but will come back to that later. The point I want to make is that all of these things are going on behind the scenes, and physicists say that these are virtual particles. They are not actually happening, but sort of \u0091virtually\u0092 happening. Then there is a challenge to us to understand what on earth is going on? The way I want you to think about it, is that these virtual processes are the means by which plans are produced. Remember I said that we have intention, understand and effects. The understanding has all these plans, but the question is: how are these plans worked out? There must be something to help these be worked out. From Swedenborg we know that all the thoughts to do with this working out come from prior levels (AC 6200). We know that the influx from the heavens is essential for us to even think, to even get our understanding working, and to operate our plans. So, what I propose to help us to understand virtual processes, is that there is another layer of three (triadic) stages as in Figure 4.\nFigure 4: Triads of virtual processes produce actual processes\nNot all of you will have understood exactly what physicists mean by field theory, but what I want to demonstrate is that, by looking at these triadic groups and postulating another prior group, we get some ideas which help us to understand quantum physics. This prior layer describes virtual processes, or potential energies, and the bottom layer is what I had to start with, which deals with the energy, the tendencies and the actual events. The point is that this new layer contains its own autonomous degree of processes, in which virtual events are produced by virtual quantum fields, starting off by what in physics is called the \u0091field Lagrangian\u0092. We don\u0092t really know where the Lagrangian comes from, so again we have the same problem, but at least we can see that the virtual processes help prepare the kinetic and potential energies, and hence help prepare the tendencies. Note that there are virtual processes appearing even if there is nothing actually happening. Even if you take the space in this room between atoms, there are still virtual processes going on. The physicists say that there is \u0091zero point energy\u0092, and that there is a \u0091physical vacuum\u0092 which consists of fluctuations of the zero-point energy. What they imply is that there are virtual fields even though there might not be particle fields, and that these virtual fields produce measurable effects.\nI want now to identify these two layers with the \u0091air\u0092 layer and the \u0091middle ether\u0092 layer of Swedenborg (LJP 320) as shown in the figure, because his middle ether is the one he said was associated with the planets and their magnetism. He knew about magnetism, and he knew about planets. The main function of virtual events is the production of electrostatic attraction & repulsion, and magnetic forces, between charged particles. We now know that magnetism does not exist by itself, and is always combined with electrostatics: we talk of electro-magnetism. So we reinterpret Swedenborg\u0092s \u0091magnetism\u0092 as that with which we know it is unified, namely electromagnetism. This looks like the middle ether. It is in the correct order, and has the correct internal structure, from Swedenborg\u0092s point of view. We have the same pattern: a principle going to causes and then to effects. We do not know where the principle comes from, but we can see that it is a principle. This is the principle that physicists have used until recently as the initial point to describe quantum field theory. They start by writing down the Lagrangian, and look at all the terms in the Lagrangian, to work out all the possible virtual processes. They work out one-step and two-step processes for these virtual events, using for example perturbation theory. Then they work out the potential and kinetic energies, and carry on with the Hamiltonian and wave functions etc. This is all just describing in a simple way what physicists do these days. A picture of this (without the words \u0091middle ether\u0092 or \u0091air\u0092, of course) would be agreeable to my colleagues at work (I have tried it out on them 13 ), so it is sensible from the physics point of view. The only thing that they find a little bit odd is that there is this strict order. There is no sort of give and take, no reciprocal interactions: I have always drawn the arrows \u0091producing\u0092 like to the right or down, so the whole business is that of influx: conditional influx. What you need to receive influx is something I don\u0092t have time to talk about: that is really another talk 14 . At least from Swedenborg we know that there is such an order.\nGravity\nWe have a middle ether, and we have air, so what about gravity? That is the thing that is missing there. Let\u0092s summarise what we know about gravity, very briefly. The best theory of gravity is Einstein\u0092s General Theory of Relativity. It is still the best theory: no-one has disproved it. Physicists are not happy with it, for reasons which I will explain, but it is still the best theory. In this theory, space and time are \u0091curved\u0092 by gravity, according to the distribution of matter. I am not going to write down Einstein\u0092s equations, but his basic idea is that the curvature of spacetime is due to the mass and energy in spacetime. There is no mention of probabilities, so it is again a classical theory. The result of this is that questions of quantum gravity are hotly discussed: the question of how to combine probabilities with the idea of curved spacetime. There have been frequent discussions of how we could possibly have in quantum gravity such a combination. For example, if space and time are somehow probabilistically generated, then how do you talk about probabilities, if we don\u0092t have a distribution of space in which to have probabilities? There must be \u0091alternatives\u0092 of some kind! I hope that if we have insight into these problems of quantum gravity from Swedenborg, then we will be able to cast some light on these fundamental problems.\nAccording to Swedenborg, if we are in the spiritual world, we know that the space and time in the spiritual world are very flexible, let\u0092s put it that way. Space depends on our mental state and our spiritual state. We know that if two people\u0092s loves are similar, then they are close together in the spiritual world. We know that the Sun, the state of the Lord in the heavens, is so different from the state of angels that it appears at an enormous distance from them, shining on them. We also know that time is very flexible in the spiritual world. It seems to be a rule that, if someone asks you to do something, and you say that you are going to do it immediately but you want to do lots of other things beforehand, you always have \u0091time\u0092 for a diversion to do whatever else you wanted to do, and then come back to what the person asked you to do. There is no clock time in the spiritual world: there is only a succession of states. You can always have many successions of states of one kind between successive states of something else, and there is not the same rate of succession in different parts. Again, we see that space and time vary according to loves.\nNow I am going to present some ideas which are not really a theory, but an attempt at a unified view of what is going on, so we can begin to see correspondences. According to Swedenborg, loves dynamically generate the geometry of space and time that we have in the spiritual world (DLW 7, TCR 29). But we know that loves correspond to energies, so let\u0092s take this sentence and translate it by correspondences into physics. We end up with the statement, that the energies dynamically generate the geometry of space and time in the physical world. This is exactly what General Relativity says. We don\u0092t really understand the connections between loves and energies, or how exactly this works, but we can see the beginnings of some ideas which may in the future generate some insights. This suggests that our layers of air and middle ether need to be extended to include what I call a prior \u0091formative\u0092 degree. This is very speculative: I am using ideas of correspondences from Swedenborg to fill in the gaps.\n1 General Principle\n"}, {"score": 2486.5818, "uuid": "aaa3fb9c-6eb3-5085-bbc9-d10e9c7e1086", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000wb-15-21356", "target_hostname": "highermeaning.org", "target_uri": "http://highermeaning.org/Authors/IJT/QuantumPS-B.html", "page_rank": 1.2146486e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "Are <em>Quantum</em> <em>Physics</em> <em>and</em> Spirituality related?", "snippet": "That <em>is</em> one of <em>the</em> <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> classical <em>and</em> <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em>, because there are tendencies <em>and</em> not just hard <em>and</em> fast limits.", "explanation": null, "document": "Are Quantum Physics and Spirituality related?\nIan Thompson,\nPhysics Department, University of Surrey, U.K.\nEmail: I.Thompson@surrey.ac.uk\nArticle published in The New Philosophy July-Dec., 2002 and\nbased on a talk given to the Swedenborg Scientific Association, 20 April 2002.\nIt is particularly valuable to discuss questions concerning quantum physics and spirituality together, in order to see the connection between them from the New Church standpoint. There is an urgent reason for discussing this link, because there are people who want to identify these things. There is a widespread feeling that somehow that they are connected, but some \u0091new age\u0092 people want to say that quantum physics tells us about spirituality. We know from Swedenborg that the connection is not quite so simple, so we need to understand in more detail what is going on.\nQuantum Physics and Wave-particle Duality\nTo review where quantum physics comes in, I will remind those of you who have taken physics courses in which quantum physics has been introduced, of some of the problems we have. One of the problems is that the particles discovered in modern physics are not just little lumps that travel around, but behave as waves. The electrons, which we think of as a prime example of a little particle, can be scattered with interference patterns: diffracted through slits, around corners, or from crystals. They can be reflected as a wave. Furthermore, these waves are probability waves, so we do not say that an electron is definitely in one place, but that it has or is a distribution of probabilities. The form of this distribution can be worked out accurately in quantum physics, which makes very precise predictions. But only the probabilities are predicted: physics does not tell us exactly where the particle is. This is one of the puzzles: to understand why and how particles behave as waves.\nThe other side of the coin is that waves, light waves for example, in which colours are described by wavelengths of oscillations, behave like particles. This is the way that quantum physics started. Max Planck, just over 100 years ago, showed that he could solve some of the fundamental problems in physics by assuming that light waves were not just smooth oscillating waves as Faraday, Maxwell and others had thought, but came in lumps of energy which he called quanta. The word \u0091quanta\u0092 comes from \u0091counting\u0092.\nSmall particles in nature are not little solid bodies or corpuscles with rigid edges, the way Newton, Boyle and Locke thought in the 17th century. They are more like clouds of tendencies or propensities. The shape of these clouds is worked out very accurately in quantum mechanics (this shape is what the wave function describes), but they do not just stay dispersed like clouds because they still somehow maintain a unity. So we need a systematic account of how these spread out clouds or fields can yet only act in a single unified way to give one outcome. This selection problem is the measurement problem that quantum physics has tried to solve over the years: to understand how things that are spread out, and behave like waves while they are spread out, can then act only in a single manner with a single response.\nThe combination of these two problems that appear in quantum physics is called the problem of wave-particle duality. The task that quantum physicists now have is to try to understand the connection between those two features of quantum physics. I am not going to explain much more about the physics details, but will return to some of these things in a general way below. We need to ask what is really going on in nature: what is quantum physics telling us?\nForming connections with Swedenborg\nThe way I want to try to answer this question, is by using some ideas of Swedenborg. This is not the way I normally introduce quantum physics, but I am relying on the fact that you may well have some of these ideas already. My basic goal is to draw some correspondences between spirituality and quantum physics: not identity, but correspondences. Thus, those of you who know Swedenborg can use these correspondences to understand quantum physics, and those who know quantum physics can see the reverse connections as well.\nThese spread-out waves, I will suggest below, correspond to us before we decide what to do. Imagine that we are thinking of doing different things. In our minds we entertain possibilities. That is the function of our understanding: is to think about things before we do them. We \u0091entertain\u0092 or consider possibilities \u0096 so the wave pattern in physics is \u0091like\u0092 us when we are entertaining multiple probabilities. Thus, there is something that \u0091corresponds\u0092 between waves and understanding. Furthermore, the physical situation is more like us thinking, rather than an already completed result. Originally, physicists thought that all electrons and atoms were in very precise positions: that is, as if we had already made up our minds what to do. But we know from Swedenborg that we only get a precise outcome at the end of process that involves intention, and understanding, then deciding to act in some way in the natural (DLW 214). I will expand in more detail below, but what I want to show is that these features of quantum physics correspond to processes in our minds. There is a connection of correspondence, as we might naturally expect after Swedenborg. This last paragraph is a preview of the remaining part of this talk. Maybe you don\u0092t understand it now, but I want to give a few ideas to help as I proceed.\nThe selection problem in quantum physics\nOne big problem in physics is that the wave functions that are spread out have a shape which satisfies well-known equations, but it is still not clear, as I said, when and how physics gets just one actual outcome. The electron may have a wave function spread out over the whole room, for example, but if you have detectors in the room, only one of them, at random, will detect the electron. In quantum physics, we do not have a good reason why an electron can only be found in one detector and not somehow in all of them. So there has been a lot of discussion in the past 70 years of how in physics the standard theory with waves just leads to one outcome. This has given rise to very many alternative ideas, and these are listed in Figure 1.\n1. Only an appearance\n2. Occurs to a good approximation\nDecoherence theory,\n9. Nature is essentially spiritual\n\u0091New Age\u0092,\nE.H. Walker 6\nFigure 1: Suggested means for getting one definite actuality\nThose of you that have read some popular physics will recognise some of these alternatives, and they are all designed to answer the same measurement problem. The first suggestion is called Everett\u0092s many-worlds interpretation, in which there is not any real selection, but all alternatives occur the same time, for example in some set of parallel universes. The second theory of \u0091decoherence\u0092 says that it really like that, but that it appears to a good approximation as if only one outcome occurs. Niels Bohr thought it was the fact that experimental apparatus was \u0091classical\u0092, with no wave behaviour, that gives rise to a particular outcome. We now know that quantum physics applies to the experimental apparatus as well, so that does not really solve the problem. Werner Heisenberg, Eugene Wigner and Henry Stapp have in turn introduced the speculation that selection is something to do with consciousness or mind, and this has given rise to a whole stream of suggestions in which consciousness (or something) has become more and more involved in trying to solve the problem of quantum physics.\nWigner in a paper of 40 years ago suggested that it was the consciousness of the observing scientist, and this idea has been carried on by Stapp, who says that consciousness is actually involved in the brain. Stapp believes that since a quantum brain has many alternate things that can happen, consciousness selects one of these outcomes to produce a result. I have listed other alternatives here, which get progressively more \u0091way out\u0092. A few of these ideas we can imagine being true, for example that \u0091spirit produces nature\u0092, but some people have gone even further than that, and have said that nature is somehow essentially spiritual \u0096 that it is connected with, or equal to, the spiritual. Others have continued this theme to say that quantum physics is a way of learning about spirituality, a way to regain our spirituality. There is a great range of possible solutions here that try to solve the same problem: how something that is described by a wave can produce a definite outcome. The trouble starts from the fact that when physicists think about nature, they only have two ideas in mind: they can think of a wave or a particle 7 . The difficulty is that the objects which quantum physics tells us are in nature are not just waves, and not just particles, so the challenge is to find a new understanding and a new picture.\nAs well as the more extreme ideas above, there are further ideas that have been proposed. James Jeans, the mathematical physicist, wrote 8 about 60 years ago that \u0093the wave function looks like not something solid and substantial, but looks more like an \u0091idea\u0092\u0094. Some (e.g. Zohar 9 ) have taken this to mean that quantum physics tells us about ideas. Others, discussing the putative identity of spirit and nature, have tried to work out various ways for why they appear to be different. They have said that perhaps spirit and nature are different grades of energies, different frequencies, different dimensions, and/or different \u0091fineness\u0092 of material. Those of us with backgrounds from Swedenborg will recognise that suggesting \u0091different dimensions\u0092 here is trying to use spatial analogies (thinking from ideas of space) to distinguish mind from nature. When people try to talk about \u0091different frequencies\u0092, they are using temporal analogies to think about this difference. But we know from Swedenborg that we cannot really use either of these kinds of analogies (TCR 30).\nFrom Swedenborg we think we know which of all the above ideas make sense, that is, which of them could possibly be true. Let us point out which ones these might be, before discussing which ones are true. We know that choosing to do one particular thing cannot be just an illusion, because otherwise it would make a mockery of trying to order one\u0092s life. We know that particular outcomes are chosen, so that it cannot really just be a good approximation that selections do occur. We know that consciousness is perhaps involved. It is not ruled out, because we know from Swedenborg that spirit produces nature, and it may be that consciousness, as part of spirit, is involved. But we know that the last three ideas (9-11) cannot be true, because we know that there is an essential difference between nature and spirit, which means that we have to find a different kind of connection between quantum physics and spirituality, that is not just identity. There must be another kind of connection. Of the next set of ideas, we know that distinctions based on time or dimensions cannot be true. We know that the true distinction is not based on \u0091fineness\u0092 or \u0091subtlety\u0092: Swedenborg has comments to make about that (HH 38, TCR 280). It may be true that the wave function looks like an idea, but that is only true if we take the word \u0091like\u0092 to refer to correspondence rather than to be just equal.\nMultiple Levels\nAll of the above is a very brief and necessarily cursory introduction to how we can use Swedenborg to understand modern physics. I am going to discuss the existence of \u0091multiple generative levels\u0092 or \u0091discrete levels\u0092. Swedenborg makes a great effort to distinguish discrete from continuous levels (HH 38, DLW 184ff), and what I want to show is that there are discrete levels within the natural, that is, within quantum physics. This will help us to understand what is going on in physics. Furthermore, these discrete levels within the natural will correspond to other discrete levels we know about within spiritual processes. Thus, we have this triadic structure within the natural, as well as within the spiritual, and these are linked together by correspondences. This is the overall theme for what follows.\nIf we recapitulate what Swedenborg tells us about how spirit and nature are combined, and if we look at what Swedenborg said after he was told what was actually happening rather than what he tried to guess at in his earlier years, which is quite different, then we see that he later in his life learned that the spirit is an essential means in the creation of nature. Nature is not created immediately from the Infinite, but is created by means of the spirit. He came to see that the natural world is a final effect of causes working in the spiritual world, which themselves manifest certain forms of love. So, as a consequence, this pattern of love > wisdom > effect is the pattern that we can try to use to understand what is happening in quantum physics.\nThis pattern can be summarised in many ways: love > wisdom > effect; or soul > mind > body, as the same triadic pattern. Swedenborg gives us ample reason to show that this is repeated in the soul: we have celestial, spiritual and spiritual-natural. It is repeated in the mind: we have an interior rational, an exterior natural, and a sensory mind. So the question is, it is also repeated in the natural world?\nSwedenborg has a variety of things to say about degrees in the natural world (see e.g Hugo Lj. Odhner\u0092s article 10 ). When Swedenborg started, he had quite a few different ideas that varied from book to book. I am going to talk about his \u0091ethers\u0092, which is something about which he changed his mind a number of times, also concerning how they are related to the spiritual world 11 . If we read from Last Judgement (Posthumous),\n\u0093the three natural atmospheres arising from the sun of the world are the purer ether, which is universal, from which is all gravitation; the middle ether, which forms the vortex around the planets, in which are the moons and the satellites, from which is magnetism; and the ultimate ether which is the air.\u0094 (LJP 320)\nThis is where he talks about three degrees in nature. These days, we don\u0092t believe in \u0091ether\u0092, but the question is whether we can interpret what he says about purer, middle, and ultimate ethers in such a way that makes sense. I am going to assume that these three adjectives refer to different kinds of ethers. He might not have known from the scientific point of view what they were, but they certainly appear to be three different things, and certainly not three different vacuums 12 . But do we recognise this pattern? Does it make sense to us? We have to allow some flexibility in the interpretation of what he meant by ether, but he does tell us what are the functions of these three ethers. He tells us that the first one is to do with gravity, the middle one is to do with magnetism, and the final one is to do with material things. Do those descriptions make sense?\nLet us try and work out what three degrees in the natural might be, if we use New Church principles to work out a priori what those degrees might be expected to consist of. From the correspondences of the natural with the three degrees in the spiritual, then in the natural there must be (a) a way of receiving in the body the intentions of the spirit, furthermore there must be (b) a propagation of causes within the natural, and there must be (c) a way of producing effects in the natural. We can think of these as ends, cause, and effects, all in the natural. This is what we expect to see from Swedenborg\u0092s point of view. Is there a way of looking at the natural that we know about from science, in which we see these three degrees?\nIn modern physics we do not know anything about ends; in fact we deliberately refuse to consider ends in physics, as a rule. But we know a great deal about the propagation of causes in physics: that is what physics does extremely well. It tells us how causes propagate through sequences and the various changes produced. And in physics we know some little about effects. In fact, the irony is that the whole business I talked about earlier, of getting a definite outcome in quantum physics, is precisely because physics does not know enough about the actual effects. So it is clear that contemporary physics knows a lot about propagation of causes, and it knows almost everything about the production of effects, though there is still something missing from what quantum physics tells about the final effects. Thus, if Swedenborg has any light to cast on what these three degrees are, it should help fill in an important lacuna, a noticeable gap in quantum physics, which is the production of effects.\nEnergy\nIf we look at physics, and at what physics regards as part of its central understanding, the important idea in physics is energy. Energy is the theme that goes through contemporary physics. It talks about potential energy, and about kinetic energy: kinetic energy is energy to do with motion, and potential energy is to do with what would happen if the circumstances were right. In classical physics we can go a long way by knowing about conservation of energy (as well as conservation of momentum, angular momentum etc). Energy in quantum physics, the total of the kinetic and potential energies, is converted into what is called the Hamiltonian operator (normally abbreviated H). I will just say that this operator enters into the Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation, which governs all quantum wave forms. It thus generates all fields of probabilities, and hence all time evolution. All of the dynamics in quantum physics is specified by knowing what the initial state is, and what the Hamiltonian operator is. So, energy in some form is very important in both classical and quantum physics.\nThus, whenever I do quantum physics as part of my job in nuclear physics, I first try and find the Hamiltonian, then I solve Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nHY(x,t) = i\u00b6Y(x,t)/\u00b6 t.\nHere, the Hamiltonian H is an operator acting on the wave function which tells us how the wave function changes, by means of the derivative of the wave function with respect to time on the right hand side of the equation. In this way, the Hamiltonian determines all the dynamics, as we can solve this equation to find the wave function at all places x and times t into the future. The central equation in quantum physics is an equation of this form (perhaps the Schr\u00f6dinger or the Dirac equation), which always has a time derivative which tells how the wave function varies with time. Furthermore, once we have this wave function, we can find probabilities by taking its square modulus |Y(x,t)|2. The question is now, do we see a triad of end > cause > effect in this structure? I have just described the structure of quantum physics as every atomic physicist, every nuclear physicist practices it. Do we see the triad there? I claim that we do, if we look properly.\nFigure 2: Correspondences of Quantum and Mental Processes\nThree Quantum Degrees\nI claim that that there are three things. To help you understand, at the bottom of Figure 2, I have drawn the correspondences to what they are in the mind. Those of you that know quantum physics can look up at the top, and those that know Swedenborg can look at the bottom, and then I want to make a connection between these. If you know one, these connections will help you understand the other. Thus, looking again at quantum physics, we have the Hamiltonian which is to do with total energy, which is somehow active, since it is an operator which operates on the wave function and changes it. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is the rule for how the Hamiltonian operator produces what we can call the \u0091tendency wave\u0092: a wave function which is a form of propensities or tendencies for action: a probability wave. Then this wave function (in fact its squared modulus) gives a probability for different outcomes. This is the structure of quantum physics, and in this structure we now see the same kind of structure of triadic degrees that we have in our minds. At the bottom of Figure 2 is a very simple triad from psychology. If we look just in our external mind, then we have intention, thinking about plans, both leading to action. This is the corresponding triad to the processes in quantum physics (of course, not the same triad). From Swedenborg we know about love > wisdom > use (or affection > understanding > decision, or celestial > spiritual > natural) and we have in general correspondences to all these triads. We know that the same pattern repeats itself in the whole, and in each part. I am talking about every single process for every single particle in quantum physics: every time any smallest thing evolves in time, we see the same triadic pattern.\nWe see that there is a correspondence between energy and intention. It is very popular these days to use energy in a very general way to refer to all of intentions in our mind and in our spirit: we talk about mental energy, and about spiritual energy. Many people confuse these: they conflate spiritual energy with physical energy, saying that these are just different kinds of energies. Here we can see that they correspond to each other. Swedenborg would use \u0091heat\u0092 and \u0091light\u0092 (DLW 5), and I think that the word \u0091energy\u0092 is a good general interpretation of the meaning of \u0091heat\u0092 or calor. In the top middle we have waves or field structures, where Swedenborg refers to light, but these waves are waves of energy, that are spreading out and trying to do something. We know that light is a form of energy, while Swedenborg says \u0091wisdom is the form of love\u0092 (AE 1170[6]), or \u0091intentions take form in the understanding\u0092. There are many similarities in the logical structure of the sentences which connect these first two degrees.\nFor those of you who wonder how quantum physics differs from physics that we know, I will just give a brief demonstration of how this makes a difference. Imagine someone roller-skating in a hollow. In classical physics there is a limit, not unexpectedly called the \u0091classical turning point\u0092, at which the kinetic energy runs out, as energy has all turned into potential energy. In quantum theory, by contrast, there is no sharp limit, since everything is based on tendencies, and is not just predetermined and rigid. If this were an electron in an atom, then it appears with a small probability even in what is called the \u0091classically forbidden region\u0092. This is extremely important in quantum physics, and gives rise to what in my mind is interesting about quantum processes. It is essential to understanding things such as transistors, where electrons tunnel through very thin layers, because if you have another dip on the right hand side then they can get through. The same thing appears with radioactive decay, because the proton or alpha particle inside a big nucleus has a big barrier which stops it getting out, but it can still tunnel out with a very small probability and therefore you get a very long lifetime, such as thousands of millions of years, but it still gets out eventually. That is one of the differences between classical and quantum physics, because there are tendencies and not just hard and fast limits. The fact of having tendencies is related to what Swedenborg tells us concerning intentions, or conatus, that produce the results without having a fixed connection between them.\nWhat I have given so far is a brief summary of the correspondence between energy and waves of quantum physics, and intention and thoughts or understanding in the mind. We should really draw the mind above the physical degree, so intention, understanding and effects produce, and correspond to, energy and wave forms.\nQuantum Field Theory\nIn quantum physics, the starting Hamiltonian is composed of kinetic and potential energy. Now the question is, where does the Hamiltonian come from? I\u0092m going to try and describe what is called quantum field theory. You may not follow the details, but it is important to my argument that physics has discovered more of what, so to speak, is \u0091behind\u0092 the Hamiltonian. When quantum physics started 70 years ago, physicists had to invent the Hamiltonian. There were various clues and tricks, and if the results came out right you knew that you were successful. But, in reality, there is some physics behind that. We now know that the potential energy part of the Hamiltonian is not just arbitrary, but comes about from what are called virtual processes. We know that the electromagnetic forces between two charged particles are not just given by Maxwell\u0092s equations, but are given by \u0091virtual photons\u0092 or \u0091gamma rays\u0092 that are exchanged. The nuclear attraction between two protons, or between a proton and a neutron is not just arbitrary, but is given by the exchange of quarks and gluons. Quarks are attracted to each other by exchanging gluons. So there is something going on \u0091behind the scenes\u0092 of what I have described so far, which produces the Hamiltonian. What are these events? Furthermore, the kinetic energy, which is to do with mass, is said by physicists to be \u0091dressed\u0092 by virtual processes. This means, for example, that a bare electron has a cloud of photons that go along with it, because it is continually emitting and receiving photons, and these photons contribute mass via their energy of their own. So even the mass and the kinetic energy are not things that are given immediately, but are also produced from behind the scenes, and appear in the Hamiltonian which contains kinetic and potential energy together.\nFigure 3: Forces from exchange of virtual particles\nI will just mention what some of these virtual processes are, as pictured in Figure 3. This is physics that has been discovered in the last 50 years: that the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles is by exchange of photons; the nuclear forces between protons and neutrons is by exchange of a gluon; the weak interaction is by exchange of \u0091heavy vector mesons\u0092 called the Z and W particles. In physics we say that there are four kinds of interactions altogether. There are these three here: electromagnetism, nuclear and weak forces; and the fourth one is gravity. So far I have not said much about gravity, but will come back to that later. The point I want to make is that all of these things are going on behind the scenes, and physicists say that these are virtual particles. They are not actually happening, but sort of \u0091virtually\u0092 happening. Then there is a challenge to us to understand what on earth is going on? The way I want you to think about it, is that these virtual processes are the means by which plans are produced. Remember I said that we have intention, understand and effects. The understanding has all these plans, but the question is: how are these plans worked out? There must be something to help these be worked out. From Swedenborg we know that all the thoughts to do with this working out come from prior levels (AC 6200). We know that the influx from the heavens is essential for us to even think, to even get our understanding working, and to operate our plans. So, what I propose to help us to understand virtual processes, is that there is another layer of three (triadic) stages as in Figure 4.\nFigure 4: Triads of virtual processes produce actual processes\nNot all of you will have understood exactly what physicists mean by field theory, but what I want to demonstrate is that, by looking at these triadic groups and postulating another prior group, we get some ideas which help us to understand quantum physics. This prior layer describes virtual processes, or potential energies, and the bottom layer is what I had to start with, which deals with the energy, the tendencies and the actual events. The point is that this new layer contains its own autonomous degree of processes, in which virtual events are produced by virtual quantum fields, starting off by what in physics is called the \u0091field Lagrangian\u0092. We don\u0092t really know where the Lagrangian comes from, so again we have the same problem, but at least we can see that the virtual processes help prepare the kinetic and potential energies, and hence help prepare the tendencies. Note that there are virtual processes appearing even if there is nothing actually happening. Even if you take the space in this room between atoms, there are still virtual processes going on. The physicists say that there is \u0091zero point energy\u0092, and that there is a \u0091physical vacuum\u0092 which consists of fluctuations of the zero-point energy. What they imply is that there are virtual fields even though there might not be particle fields, and that these virtual fields produce measurable effects.\nI want now to identify these two layers with the \u0091air\u0092 layer and the \u0091middle ether\u0092 layer of Swedenborg (LJP 320) as shown in the figure, because his middle ether is the one he said was associated with the planets and their magnetism. He knew about magnetism, and he knew about planets. The main function of virtual events is the production of electrostatic attraction & repulsion, and magnetic forces, between charged particles. We now know that magnetism does not exist by itself, and is always combined with electrostatics: we talk of electro-magnetism. So we reinterpret Swedenborg\u0092s \u0091magnetism\u0092 as that with which we know it is unified, namely electromagnetism. This looks like the middle ether. It is in the correct order, and has the correct internal structure, from Swedenborg\u0092s point of view. We have the same pattern: a principle going to causes and then to effects. We do not know where the principle comes from, but we can see that it is a principle. This is the principle that physicists have used until recently as the initial point to describe quantum field theory. They start by writing down the Lagrangian, and look at all the terms in the Lagrangian, to work out all the possible virtual processes. They work out one-step and two-step processes for these virtual events, using for example perturbation theory. Then they work out the potential and kinetic energies, and carry on with the Hamiltonian and wave functions etc. This is all just describing in a simple way what physicists do these days. A picture of this (without the words \u0091middle ether\u0092 or \u0091air\u0092, of course) would be agreeable to my colleagues at work (I have tried it out on them 13 ), so it is sensible from the physics point of view. The only thing that they find a little bit odd is that there is this strict order. There is no sort of give and take, no reciprocal interactions: I have always drawn the arrows \u0091producing\u0092 like to the right or down, so the whole business is that of influx: conditional influx. What you need to receive influx is something I don\u0092t have time to talk about: that is really another talk 14 . At least from Swedenborg we know that there is such an order.\nGravity\nWe have a middle ether, and we have air, so what about gravity? That is the thing that is missing there. Let\u0092s summarise what we know about gravity, very briefly. The best theory of gravity is Einstein\u0092s General Theory of Relativity. It is still the best theory: no-one has disproved it. Physicists are not happy with it, for reasons which I will explain, but it is still the best theory. In this theory, space and time are \u0091curved\u0092 by gravity, according to the distribution of matter. I am not going to write down Einstein\u0092s equations, but his basic idea is that the curvature of spacetime is due to the mass and energy in spacetime. There is no mention of probabilities, so it is again a classical theory. The result of this is that questions of quantum gravity are hotly discussed: the question of how to combine probabilities with the idea of curved spacetime. There have been frequent discussions of how we could possibly have in quantum gravity such a combination. For example, if space and time are somehow probabilistically generated, then how do you talk about probabilities, if we don\u0092t have a distribution of space in which to have probabilities? There must be \u0091alternatives\u0092 of some kind! I hope that if we have insight into these problems of quantum gravity from Swedenborg, then we will be able to cast some light on these fundamental problems.\nAccording to Swedenborg, if we are in the spiritual world, we know that the space and time in the spiritual world are very flexible, let\u0092s put it that way. Space depends on our mental state and our spiritual state. We know that if two people\u0092s loves are similar, then they are close together in the spiritual world. We know that the Sun, the state of the Lord in the heavens, is so different from the state of angels that it appears at an enormous distance from them, shining on them. We also know that time is very flexible in the spiritual world. It seems to be a rule that, if someone asks you to do something, and you say that you are going to do it immediately but you want to do lots of other things beforehand, you always have \u0091time\u0092 for a diversion to do whatever else you wanted to do, and then come back to what the person asked you to do. There is no clock time in the spiritual world: there is only a succession of states. You can always have many successions of states of one kind between successive states of something else, and there is not the same rate of succession in different parts. Again, we see that space and time vary according to loves.\nNow I am going to present some ideas which are not really a theory, but an attempt at a unified view of what is going on, so we can begin to see correspondences. According to Swedenborg, loves dynamically generate the geometry of space and time that we have in the spiritual world (DLW 7, TCR 29). But we know that loves correspond to energies, so let\u0092s take this sentence and translate it by correspondences into physics. We end up with the statement, that the energies dynamically generate the geometry of space and time in the physical world. This is exactly what General Relativity says. We don\u0092t really understand the connections between loves and energies, or how exactly this works, but we can see the beginnings of some ideas which may in the future generate some insights. This suggests that our layers of air and middle ether need to be extended to include what I call a prior \u0091formative\u0092 degree. This is very speculative: I am using ideas of correspondences from Swedenborg to fill in the gaps.\n1 General Principle\n"}, {"score": 2468.4011, "uuid": "b92dc947-6deb-53d2-a1c2-75848383e7f0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0305wb-37-08265", "target_hostname": "lesswrong.com", "target_uri": "http://lesswrong.com/lw/r5/the_quantum_physics_sequence/", "page_rank": 1.5116975e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>The</em> <em>Quantum</em> <em>Physics</em> Sequence - Less Wrong", "snippet": "Future of Humanity InstituteSingularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence This <em>is</em> an inclusive guide to <em>the</em> series of posts on <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em> that began on April 9th, 2008, including <em>the</em> digressions into related topics (such as <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> Science <em>and</em> Bayesianism) <em>and</em> some of <em>the</em> preliminary", "explanation": null, "document": "22\nEliezer_Yudkowsky 11 June 2008 03:42AM\nThis is an inclusive guide to the series of posts on quantum mechanics that began on April 9th, 2008 , including the digressions into related topics (such as the difference between Science and Bayesianism) and some of the preliminary reading.\nYou may also be interested in one of the less inclusive post guides, such as:\nAn Intuitive Explanation of Quantum Mechanics (just the science, for students confused by their physics textbooks)\nQuantum Physics Revealed As Non-Mysterious (quantum physics does not make the universe any more mysterious than it was previously)\nAnd the Winner is...

Zombies? and The Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle :\u00a0 Don't try to put your consciousness or your personal identity outside physics.\u00a0 Whatever makes you say \"I think therefore I am\", causes your lips to move; it is within the chains of cause and effect that produce our observed universe.\nBelief in the Implied Invisible :\u00a0 If a spaceship goes over the cosmological horizon relative to us, so that it can no longer communicate with us, should we believe that the spaceship instantly ceases to exist?\nBasic Quantum Mechanics:\nQuantum Explanations :\u00a0 Quantum mechanics doesn't deserve its fearsome reputation.\u00a0 If you tell people something is supposed to be mysterious, they won't understand it.\u00a0 It's human intuitions that are \"strange\" or \"weird\"; physics itself is perfectly normal.\u00a0 Talking about historical erroneous concepts like \"particles\" or \"waves\" is just asking to confuse people; present the real, unified quantum physics straight out.\u00a0 The series will take a strictly realist perspective - quantum equations describe something that is real and out there.\u00a0 Warning:\u00a0 Although a large faction of physicists agrees with this, it is not universally accepted.\u00a0 Stronger warning:\u00a0 I am not even going to present non-realist viewpoints until later, because I think this is a major source of confusion.\nConfigurations and Amplitude :\u00a0 A preliminary glimpse at the stuff reality is made of.\u00a0 The classic split-photon experiment with half-silvered mirrors.\u00a0 Alternative pathways the photon can take, can cancel each other out.\u00a0 The mysterious measuring tool that tells us the relative squared moduli.\nJoint Configurations :\u00a0 The laws of physics are inherently over mathematical entities, configurations, that involve multiple particles.\u00a0 A basic, ontologically existent entity, according to our current understanding of quantum mechanics, does not look like a photon - it looks like a configuration of the universe with \"A photon here, a photon there.\"\u00a0 Amplitude flows between these configurations can cancel or add; this gives us a way to detect which configurations are distinct.\u00a0 It is an experimentally testable fact that \"Photon 1 here, photon 2 there\" is the same configuration as \"Photon 2 here, photon 1 there\".\nDistinct Configurations :\u00a0 Since configurations are over the combined state of all the elements in a system, adding a sensor that detects whether a particle went one way or the other, becomes a new element of the system that can make configurations \"distinct\" instead of \"identical\".\u00a0 This confused the living daylights out of early quantum experimenters, because it meant that things behaved differently when they tried to \"measure\" them.\u00a0 But it's not only measuring instruments that do the trick - any sensitive physical element will do - and the distinctness of configurations is a physical fact, not a fact about our knowledge.\u00a0 There is no need to suppose that the universe cares what we think.\nWhere Philosophy Meets Science :\u00a0 In retrospect, supposing that quantum physics had anything to do with consciousness was a big mistake.\u00a0 Could philosophers have told the physicists so?\u00a0 But we don't usually see philosophers sponsoring major advances in physics; why not?\nCan You Prove Two Particles Are Identical? :\u00a0 You wouldn't think that it would be possible to do an experiment that told you that two particles are completely identical - not just to the limit of experimental precision, but perfectly. You could even give a precise-sounding philosophical argument for why it was not possible - but the argument would have a deeply buried assumption.\u00a0 Quantum physics violates this deep assumption, making the experiment easy.\nClassical Configuration Spaces :\u00a0 How to visualize the state of a system of two 1-dimensional particles, as a single point in 2-dimensional space.\u00a0 A preliminary step before moving into...\nThe Quantum Arena :\u00a0 Instead of a system state being associated with a single point in a classical configuration space, the instantaneous real state of a quantum system is a complex amplitude distribution over a quantum configuration space.\u00a0 What creates the illusion of \"individual particles\", like an electron caught in a trap, is a plaid distribution - one that happens to factor into the product of two parts.\u00a0 It is the whole distribution that evolves when a quantum system evolves.\u00a0 Individual configurations don't have physics; amplitude distributions have physics.\u00a0 Quantum entanglement is the general case; quantum independence is the special case.\nFeynman Paths :\u00a0 Instead of thinking that a photon takes a single straight path through space, we can regard it as taking all possible paths through space, and adding the amplitudes for every possible path.\u00a0 Nearly all the paths cancel out - unless we do clever quantum things, so that some paths add instead of canceling out.\u00a0 Then we can make light do funny tricks for us, like reflecting off a mirror in such a way that the angle of incidence doesn't equal the angle of reflection.\u00a0 But ordinarily, nearly all the paths except an extremely narrow band, cancel out - this is one of the keys to recovering the hallucination of classical physics.\nNo Individual Particles :\u00a0 One of the chief ways to confuse yourself while thinking about quantum mechanics, is to think as if photons were little billiard balls bouncing around.\u00a0 The appearance of little billiard balls is a special case of a deeper level on which there are only multiparticle configurations and amplitude flows.\u00a0 It is easy to set up physical situations in which there exists no fact of the matter as to which electron was originally which.\nIdentity Isn't In Specific Atoms , Three Dialogues on Identity :\u00a0 Given that there's no such thing as \"the same atom\", whether you are \"the same person\" from one time to another can't possibly depend on whether you're made out of the same atoms.\nDecoherence :\u00a0 A quantum system that factorizes can evolve into a system that doesn't factorize, destroying the illusion of independence.\u00a0 But entangling a quantum system with its environment, can appear to destroy entanglements that are already present.\u00a0 Entanglement with the environment can separate out the pieces of an amplitude distribution, preventing them from interacting with each other.\u00a0 Decoherence is fundamentally symmetric in time, but appears asymmetric because of the second law of thermodynamics.\nThe So-Called Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle :\u00a0 Unlike classical physics, in quantum physics it is not possible to separate out a particle's \"position\" from its \"momentum\".\u00a0 The evolution of the amplitude distribution over time, involves things like taking the second derivative in space and multiplying by i to get the first derivative in time.\u00a0 The end result of this time evolution rule is that blobs of particle-presence appear to race around in physical space.\u00a0 The notion of \"an exact particular momentum\" or \"an exact particular position\" is not something that can physically happen, it is a tool for analyzing amplitude distributions by taking them apart into a sum of simpler waves.\u00a0 This uses the assumption and fact of linearity: the evolution of the whole wavefunction seems to always be the additive sum of the evolution of its pieces.\u00a0 Using this tool, we can see that if you take apart the same distribution into a sum of positions and a sum of momenta, they cannot both be sharply concentrated at the same time.\u00a0 When you \"observe\" a particle's position, that is, decohere its positional distribution by making it interact with a sensor, you take its wave packet apart into two pieces; then the two pieces evolve differently.\u00a0 The Heisenberg Principle definitely does not say that knowing about the particle, or consciously seeing it, will make the universe behave differently.\nWhich Basis Is More Fundamental? :\u00a0 The position basis can be computed locally in the configuration space; the momentum basis is not local.\u00a0 Why care about locality?\u00a0 Because it is a very deep principle; reality itself seems to favor it in some way.\nWhere Physics Meets Experience :\u00a0 Meet the Ebborians, who reproduce by fission.\u00a0 The Ebborian brain is like a thick sheet of paper that splits down its thickness.\u00a0 They frequently experience dividing into two minds, and can talk to their other selves.\u00a0 It seems that their unified theory of physics is almost finished, and can answer every question, when one Ebborian asks:\u00a0 When exactly does one Ebborian become two people?\nWhere Experience Confuses Physicists :\u00a0 It then turns out that the entire planet of Ebbore is splitting along a fourth-dimensional thickness, duplicating all the people within it.\u00a0 But why does the apparent chance of \"ending up\" in one of those worlds, equal the square of the fourth-dimensional thickness?\u00a0 Many mysterious answers are proposed to this question, and one non-mysterious one.\nOn Being Decoherent :\u00a0 When a sensor measures a particle whose amplitude distribution stretches over space - perhaps seeing if the particle is to the left or right of some dividing line - then the standard laws of quantum mechanics call for the sensor+particle system to evolve into a state of (particle left, sensor measures LEFT) + (particle right, sensor measures RIGHT).\u00a0 But when we humans look at the sensor, it only seems to say \"LEFT\" or \"RIGHT\", never a mixture like \"LIGFT\".\u00a0 This, of course, is because we ourselves are made of particles, and subject to the standard quantum laws that imply decoherence.\u00a0 Under standard quantum laws, the final state is (particle left, sensor measures LEFT, human sees \"LEFT\") + (particle right, sensor measures RIGHT, human sees \"RIGHT\").\nThe Conscious Sorites Paradox :\u00a0 Decoherence is implicit in quantum physics, not an extra law on top of it.\u00a0 Asking exactly when \"one world\" splits into \"two worlds\" may be like asking when, if you keep removing grains of sand from a pile, it stops being a \"heap\".\u00a0 Even if you're inside the world, there may not be a definite answer.\u00a0 This puzzle does not arise only in quantum physics; the Ebborians could face it in a classical universe, or we could build sentient flat computers that split down their thickness.\u00a0 Is this really a physicist's problem?\nDecoherece is Pointless :\u00a0 There is no exact point at which decoherence suddenly happens.\u00a0 All of quantum mechanics is continuous and differentiable, and decoherent processes are no exception to this.\nDecoherent Essences :\u00a0 Decoherence is implicit within physics, not an extra law on top of it.\u00a0 You can choose representations that make decoherence harder to see, just like you can choose representations that make apples harder to see, but exactly the same physical process still goes on; the apple doesn't disappear and neither does decoherence.\u00a0 If you could make decoherence magically go away by choosing the right representation, we wouldn't need to shield quantum computers from the environment.\nThe Born Probabilities :\u00a0 The last serious mysterious question left in quantum physics:\u00a0 When a quantum world splits in two, why do we seem to have a greater probability of ending up in the larger blob, exactly proportional to the integral of the squared modulus?\u00a0 It's an open problem, but non-mysterious answers have been proposed.\u00a0 Try not to go funny in the head about it.\nDecoherence as Projection :\u00a0 Since quantum evolution is linear and unitary, decoherence can be seen as projecting a wavefunction onto orthogonal subspaces.\u00a0 This can be neatly illustrated using polarized photons and the angle of the polarized sheet that will absorb or transmit them.\nEntangled Photons :\u00a0 Using our newly acquired understanding of photon polarizations, we see how to construct a quantum state of two photons in which, when you measure one of them, the person in the same world as you, will always find that the opposite photon has opposite quantum state.\u00a0 This is not because any influence is transmitted; it is just decoherence that takes place in a very symmetrical way, as can readily be observed in our calculations.\nMany Worlds:\n(At this point in the sequence, most of the mathematical background has been built up, and we are ready to evaluate interpretations of quantum mechanics.)\nBell's Theorem: No EPR \"Reality\" :\u00a0 (Note:\u00a0 This post was designed to be read as a stand-alone, if desired.)\u00a0 Originally, the discoverers of quantum physics thought they had discovered an incomplete description of reality - that there was some deeper physical process they were missing, and this was why they couldn't predict exactly the results of quantum experiments.\u00a0 The math of Bell's Theorem is surprisingly simple, and we walk through it.\u00a0 Bell's Theorem rules out being able to locally predict a single, unique outcome of measurements - ruling out a way that Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen once defined \"reality\".\u00a0 This shows how deep implicit philosophical assumptions can go.\u00a0 If worlds can split, so that there is no single unique outcome, then Bell's Theorem is no problem.\u00a0 Bell's Theorem does, however, rule out the idea that quantum physics describes our partial knowledge of a deeper physical state that could locally produce single outcomes - any such description will be inconsistent.\nSpooky Action at a Distance: The No-Communication Theorem :\u00a0 As Einstein argued long ago, the quantum physics of his era - that is, the single-global-world interpretation of quantum physics, in which experiments have single unique random results - violates Special Relativity; it imposes a preferred space of simultaneity and requires a mysterious influence to be transmitted faster than light; which mysterious influence can never be used to transmit any useful information.\u00a0 Getting rid of the single global world dispels this mystery and puts everything back to normal again.\nDecoherence is Simple , Decoherence is Falsifiable and Testable :\u00a0 (Note:\u00a0 Designed to be standalone readable.)\u00a0 An epistle to the physicists.\u00a0 To probability theorists, words like \"simple\", \"falsifiable\", and \"testable\" have exact mathematical meanings, which are there for very strong reasons.\u00a0 The (minority?) faction of physicists who say that many-worlds is \"not falsifiable\" or that it \"violates Occam's Razor\" or that it is \"untestable\", are committing the same kind of mathematical crime as non-physicists who invent their own theories of gravity that go as inverse-cube.\u00a0 This is one of the reasons why I, a non-physicist, dared to talk about physics - because I saw (some!) physicists using probability theory in a way that was simply wrong.\u00a0 Not just criticizable, but outright mathematically wrong:\u00a0 2 + 2 = 3.\nQuantum Non-Realism :\u00a0 \"Shut up and calculate\" is the best approach you can take when none of your theories are very good.\u00a0 But that is not the same as claiming that \"Shut up!\" actually is a theory of physics.\u00a0 Saying \"I don't know what these equations mean, but they seem to work\" is a very different matter from saying:\u00a0 \"These equations definitely don't mean anything, they just work!\"\nCollapse Postulates :\u00a0 Early physicists simply didn't think of the possibility of more than one world - it just didn't occur to them, even though it's the straightforward result of applying the quantum laws at all levels.\u00a0 So they accidentally invented a completely and strictly unnecessary part of quantum theory to ensure there was only one world - a law of physics that says that parts of the wavefunction mysteriously and spontaneously disappear when decoherence prevents us from seeing them any more.\u00a0 If such a law really existed, it would be the only non-linear, non-unitary, non-differentiable, non-local, non-CPT-symmetric, acausal, faster-than-light phenomenon in all of physics.\nIf Many-Worlds Had Come First :\u00a0 If early physicists had never made the mistake, and thought immediately to apply the quantum laws at all levels to produce macroscopic decoherence, then \"collapse postulates\" would today seem like a completely crackpot theory.\u00a0 In addition to their other problems, like FTL, the collapse postulate would be the only physical law that was informally specified - often in dualistic (mentalistic) terms - because it was the only fundamental law adopted without precise evidence to nail it down.\u00a0 Here, we get a glimpse at that alternate Earth.\nMany Worlds, One Best Guess :\u00a0 Summarizes the arguments that nail down macroscopic decoherence, aka the \"many-worlds interpretation\".\u00a0 Concludes that many-worlds wins outright given the current state of evidence.\u00a0 The argument should have been over fifty years ago.\u00a0 New physical evidence could reopen it, but we have no particular reason to expect this.\nLiving in Many Worlds :\u00a0 The many worlds of quantum mechanics are not some strange, alien universe into which you have been thrust.\u00a0 They are where you have always lived.\u00a0 Egan's Law:\u00a0 \"It all adds up to normality.\"\u00a0 Then why care about quantum physics at all?\u00a0 Because there's still the question of what adds up to normality, and the answer to this question turns out to be, \"Quantum physics.\"\u00a0 If you're thinking of building any strange philosophies around many-worlds, you probably shouldn't - that's not what it's for.\nTimeless Physics:\n(Now we depart from what is nailed down in standard physics, and enter into more speculative realms - particularly Julian Barbour's Machian timeless physics.)\nMach's Principle: Anti-Epiphenomenal Physics :\u00a0 Could you tell if the whole universe were shifted an inch to the left?\u00a0 Could you tell if the whole universe was traveling left at ten miles per hour?\u00a0 Could you tell if the whole universe was accelerating left at ten miles per hour?\u00a0 Could you tell if the whole universe was rotating?\nRelative Configuration Space :\u00a0 Maybe the reason why we can't observe absolute speeds, absolute positions, absolute accelerations, or absolute rotations, is that particles don't have absolute positions - only positions relative to each other.\u00a0 That is, maybe quantum physics takes place in a relative configuration space.\nTimeless Physics :\u00a0 What time is it?\u00a0 How do you know?\u00a0 The question \"What time is it right now?\" may make around as much sense as asking \"Where is the universe?\"\u00a0 Not only that, our physics equations may not need a t in them!\nTimeless Beauty :\u00a0 To get rid of time you must reduce it to nontime.\u00a0 In timeless physics, everything that exists is perfectly global or perfectly local.\u00a0 The laws of physics are perfectly global; the configuration space is perfectly local.\u00a0 Every fundamentally existent ontological entity has a unique identity and a unique value.\u00a0 This beauty makes ugly theories much more visibly ugly; a collapse postulate becomes a visible scar on the perfection.\nTimeless Causality :\u00a0 Using the modern, Bayesian formulation of causality, we can define causality without talking about time - define it purely in terms of relations.\u00a0 The river of time never flows, but it has a direction.\nTimeless Identity :\u00a0 How can you be the same person tomorrow as today, in the river that never flows, when not a drop of water is shared between one time and another?\u00a0 Having used physics to completely trash all naive theories of identity, we reassemble a conception of persons and experiences from what is left.\u00a0 With a surprising practical application...\nThou Art Physics :\u00a0 If the laws of physics control everything we do, then how can our choices be meaningful?\u00a0 Because you are physics.\u00a0 You aren't competing with physics for control of the universe, you are within physics.\u00a0 Anything you control is necessarily controlled by physics.\nTimeless Control :\u00a0 We throw away \"time\" but retain causality, and with it, the concepts \"control\" and \"decide\".\u00a0 To talk of something as having been \"always determined\" is mixing up a timeless and a timeful conclusion, with paradoxical results.\u00a0 When you take a perspective outside time, you have to be careful not to let your old, timeful intuitions run wild in the absence of their subject matter.\nRationality and Science:\n(Okay, so it was many-worlds all along and collapse theories are silly.\u00a0 Did first-half-of-20th-century physicists really screw up that badly?\u00a0 How did they go wrong?\u00a0 Why haven't modern physicists unanimously endorsed many-worlds, if the issue is that clear-cut?\u00a0 What lessons can we learn from this whole debacle?)\nThe Failures of Eld Science :\u00a0 A short story set in the same world as Initiation Ceremony .\u00a0 Future physics students look back on the cautionary tale of quantum physics.\nThe Dilemma: Science or Bayes? :\u00a0 The failure of first-half-of-20th-century-physics was not due to straying from the scientific method.\u00a0 Science and rationality - that is, Science and Bayesianism - aren't the same thing, and sometimes they give different answers.\nScience Doesn't Trust Your Rationality :\u00a0 The reason Science doesn't always agree with the exact, Bayesian, rational answer, is that Science doesn't trust you to be rational.\u00a0 It wants you to go out and gather overwhelming experimental evidence.\nWhen Science Can't Help :\u00a0 If you have an idea, Science tells you to test it experimentally.\u00a0 If you spend 10 years testing the idea and the result comes out negative, Science slaps you on the back and says, \"Better luck next time.\"\u00a0 If you want to spend 10 years testing a hypothesis that will actually turn out to be right, you'll have to try to do the thing that Science doesn't trust you to do: think rationally, and figure out the answer before you get clubbed over the head with it.\nScience Isn't Strict Enough :\u00a0 Science lets you believe any damn stupid idea that hasn't been refuted by experiment.\u00a0 Bayesianism says there is always an exactly rational degree of belief given your current evidence, and this does not shift a nanometer to the left or to the right depending on your whims.\u00a0 Science is a social freedom - we let people test whatever hypotheses they like, because we don't trust the village elders to decide in advance - but you shouldn't confuse that with an individual standard of rationality.\nDo Scientists Already Know This Stuff? :\u00a0 No.\u00a0 Maybe someday it will be part of standard scientific training, but for now, it's not, and the absence is visible.\nNo Safe Defense, Not Even Science :\u00a0 Why am I trying to break your trust in Science?\u00a0 Because you can't think and trust at the same time.\u00a0 The social rules of Science are verbal rather than quantitative; it is possible to believe you are following them.\u00a0 With Bayesianism, it is never possible to do an exact calculation and get the exact rational answer that you know exists.\u00a0 You are visibly less than perfect, and so you will not be tempted to trust yourself.\nChanging the Definition of Science :\u00a0 Many of these ideas are surprisingly conventional, and being floated around by other thinkers.\u00a0 I'm a good deal less of a lonely iconoclast than I seem; maybe it's just the way I talk.\nFaster Than Science :\u00a0 Is it really possible to arrive at the truth faster than Science does?\u00a0 Not only is it possible, but the social process of science relies on scientists doing so - when they choose which hypotheses to test.\u00a0 In many answer spaces it's not possible to find the true hypothesis by accident.\u00a0 Science leaves it up to experiment to socially declare who was right, but if there weren't some people who could get it right in the absence of overwhelming experimental proof, science would be stuck.\nEinstein's Speed :\u00a0 Albert was unusually good at finding the right theory in the presence of only a small amount of experimental evidence.\u00a0 Even more unusually, he admitted it - he claimed to know the theory was right, even in advance of the public proof.\u00a0 It's possible to arrive at the truth by thinking great high-minded thoughts of the sort that Science does not trust you to think, but it's a lot harder than arriving at the truth in the presence of overwhelming evidence.\nThat Alien Message :\u00a0 Einstein used evidence more efficiently than other physicists, but he was still extremely inefficient in an absolute sense.\u00a0 If a huge team of cryptographers and physicists were examining a interstellar transmission, going over it bit by bit, we could deduce principles on the order of Galilean gravity just from seeing one or two frames of a picture.\u00a0 As if the very first human to see an apple fall, had, on the instant, realized that its position went as the square of the time and that this implied constant acceleration.\nMy Childhood Role Model :\u00a0 I looked up to the ideal of a Bayesian superintelligence, not Einstein.\nEinstein's Superpowers :\u00a0 There's an unfortunate tendency to talk as if Einstein had superpowers - as if, even before Einstein was famous, he had an inherent disposition to be Einstein - a potential as rare as his fame and as magical as his deeds.\u00a0 Yet the way you acquire superpowers is not by being born with them, but by seeing, with a sudden shock, that they are perfectly normal.\nClass Project :\u00a0 From the world of Initiation Ceremony. Brennan and the others are faced with their midterm exams.\nWhy Quantum? :\u00a0 Why do a series on quantum mechanics?\u00a0 Some of the many morals that are best illustrated by the tale of quantum mechanics and its misinterpretation.\n"}, {"score": 2464.8726, "uuid": "aefffb39-c6db-5714-a3d4-e2bd8f3d3916", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100wb-50-11485", "target_hostname": "www.aco4u.com", "target_uri": "http://www.aco4u.com/adult/cl/qmech.html", "page_rank": 1.1784445e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "SATAN, SATANIST, <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>", "snippet": "Anyway, <em>Quantum</em> <em>physics</em> or &quot;Magic&quot; <em>is</em> a reality, <em>and</em> if we don\u0092t avail ourselves of it, we are fools.", "explanation": null, "document": "The Sermon Of The Week\nMagic & Quantum Mechanics\nby Father Nate Leved\nof Church Lucifer\nHail Lucifer!

He received the Templeton Prize in March this year upon work that shows how science cannot fully explain reality. The Templeton is the largest prize in the world in terms of monetary value and is annually awarded by the Templeton Foundation to acknowledge work that finds a common ground between science and religion and to individuals who reaffirm the spiritual dimension of life.\nBernard d\u2019Espagnat\u2019s major contribution in science is his work on several aspects of quantum mechanics . It was this work which lead him to explore the nature of reality and to question the disregarding attitude many scientists have towards the philosophical questions thrown up by quantum physics.\nd\u2019Espagnat\u2019s ideas on the doomed division between science and \u2018ultimate reality\u2019\nFrom The Guardian :\n\u201cWhat quantum mechanics tells us, I believe, is surprising to say the least. It tells us that the basic components of objects \u2013 the particles, electrons, quarks etc. \u2013 cannot be thought of as \u201cself-existent\u201d. The reality that they, and hence all objects, are components of is merely \u201cempirical reality\u201d.\nThis reality is something that, while not a purely mind-made construct as radical idealism would have it, can be but the picture our mind forces us to form of \u2026 Of what ? The only answer I am able to provide is that underlying this empirical reality is a mysterious, non-conceptualisable \u201cultimate reality\u201d, not embedded in space and (presumably) not in time either.\u201d\nFrom Princeton University Press (In a review of his book On Physics and Philosophy):\nHis overall conclusion is that while the physical implications of quantum theory suggest that scientific knowledge will never truly describe mind-independent reality, the notion of such an ultimate reality\u2013one we can never access directly or rationally and which he calls \u201cveiled reality\u201d\u2013remains conceptually necessary nonetheless.\nFrom his Templeton page :\n\u201cthe things we observe may be tentatively interpreted as signs providing us with some perhaps not entirely misleading glimpses of a higher reality and, therefore, that higher forms of spirituality are fully compatible with what seems to emerge from contemporary physics.\u201d\nIn a statement prepared for the news conference, d\u2019Espagnat pointed out that since science cannot tell us anything certain about the nature of being, clearly it cannot tell us with certainty what it is not.\nFrom the BBC report on the news :\nHis concept of an ultimate reality \u2013 as he terms it, \u201cthe ground of things\u201d \u2013 is only glimpsed, not explicitly described, by science.\nScience, he said, \u201cis aimed not at describing \u2018reality as it really is\u2019 but at predicting what will be observed in such-and-such circumstances\u201d.\nFrom the statement delivered by d\u2019Espagnat on the prize ceremony:\nAt this point I\u2019d like to draw your attention on the fact that, if true, this conception of mine has two significant consequences.\nOne of them is that if indeed it is our mind that, due to its own structure, carves all objects out of the \u201cground of things,\u201d obviously we cannot any more picture mind to ourselves as being itself an emanation of (some class of) objects. If the notion \u201cemanation\u201d is here to be kept, we may only claim that mind emanates \u201cfrom the ground of things.\u201d As we shall immediately see, the difference is far from being a negligible one.\nFor indeed \u2013 and this is nothing else than the second consequence I just mentioned \u2013 this \u201cground of things,\u201d this Real, quite obviously is not a thing.

The practice of religion is nothing but a ceaseless quest after the facts of the inner life. A dispassionate study of these facts constitutes the science of religion which seeks to unravel the mystery of our inner being- the lights that guide us and the laws that mould us.\nIf 'man, the known', constituted of his body and its environing world, is the subject of study of the natural sciences, 'man. the unknown' is the subject of study of the science of religion. The synthesis of both these sciences is the high function of philosophy as understood in India. It is this function which Vedanta has performed in this country (India), ever since the time of the Upanishads. Exercising a pervasive and effective influence on our national thought and culture, Vedanta has spared us not only the fruitless opposition of reason to faith and vice versa, but also the more dangerous manifestation of this opposition in the form of intolerance, persecution, and suppression of opinion.\nThe need for a Vedantic approach to science and religion is insistent today when both have shed their respective prejudices and come closer to each other, imbued with the passion to serve man and save his civilisation. It is only such a synthesis of philosophy which blends in itself the flavour of the faith of religion and the reason of science that can reconstruct modern man, by restoring to him the integrity of his being and the unity\nThe 'Within' and the 'Without' of Nature\nExplaining this Indian approach to religion and the cause of the misunderstanding between science and religion, Swami Vivekananda said:\n\"Religion deals with the truths of the metaphysical world, just as chemistry and the other natural sciences deal with the truth of the physical world. The book one must read to learn chemistry is the book of (external) nature. The book from which to learn religion is your own mind and heart. The sage is often ignorant of physical science, because he reads the wrong book - the book within and the scientist is too often is ignorant of religion, because he, too, reads the wrong book - the book without\".\nThe practice of religion is a ceaseless quest after the facts of a man's inner life, at the innermost depth of which it finds the truth of God, which it defines as infinite existence, infinite knowledge, and infinite bliss, the Sat-Chit-Ananda Brahman it comes across, at the intermediate depths, and all higher values which find expression in man's ethical, moral, and aesthetic experiences. A dispassionate study of these facts constitutes the science of religion, the science of art of the spiritual life.\nUpanishads grappled with these questions: What is this universe? What is man? What is his destiny? Long ago they discovered that the universe of experience consists of two broad categories, the subjective and the objective. It is important to remember that this idea is basic to an understanding of Vedanta and to an understanding of whither science is going today. Now, when we apply this classification to the whole universe, we get the corollary that modern science is the study of only one of the two categories, namely, the objective field. But modern science is also trying to understand the subjective field.\nPsychology is one such science. But Western psychology has suffered from too great a dominance by psychology . By resorting to time and space methodology, we get a knowledge of the 'without' of things, but not of their 'within'. Much of psychology in the West is behaviouristic psychology: it is a study of the human mind through the study of human behaviour.\nBut Western psychologists have also tried to break from this kind of limitation and have developed, through psycho-analysis, the beginning of what is called depth psychology. This is just the beginning of a great movement in modern psychology which, if continued steadily and penetratingly, will bring it to the truth of the real nature of man which Vedanta reached ages ago in India - the eternal, undying Self of man, the Atman.\nVedanta and modern science are close to each other in spirit and temper. They are close to each other in their objectives and in very many of their conclusions as well. Even in the cosmology of the physical universe, we find so many points of contact. The fundamental position in the cosmology of both science and Vedanta is what Swami Vivekananda calls the postulate of a self-evolving cause. Vedanta says that there is one self-evolving cause, Brahman, behind the universe. Science says that behind this universe there is one self-evolving cause, the background material, in the words of astronomer Fred Hoyle.\nBoth believe in the theory of a cosmic evolution. There are a number of such similarities. The truths expounded in the Upanishads are impersonal, Apauruseya, not deriving sanction from any person. Scientific truths are similarly impersonal, objective, not deriving sanction from any person. Because they are impersonal, they are universal, and provide a clear insight into the nature of the world. That is science.\nWhen we study the development of science during the last hundred years, we can trace the higher reaches of science slowly appearing on the horizon, and trace also the slow emergence of a non-materialistic outlook in science.\nModern Physics and Philosophical Reason\nIn countless ways, every department of physical science today is extending the bounds of man\u0092s knowledge of fundamental unity behind the manifold diversities of the universe. Physical science started with the exploration of the mysteries of external nature; but at the farthest end of this search, it finds itself face to face with the mystery of man, of his mind and consciousness, the deepest mystery of all.\nThe philosophies of the East, particularly the Vedanta of India, including Buddhist thought, directly faced this mystery of man, more than two thousand years ago, by initiating the exploration of the internal world and carrying it through to its depths. And, today, we witness a steady convergence of these two indirect and direct approaches in the steady emergence of a common philosophy of the one behind the many.\nPhysicists of the first quarter of the twentieth century, faced with the challenge of the revolutionary discoveries of relativity and quantum physics, turned into bold philosophical thinkers, initiating the development of reason of physics into Buddhi or philosophical Reason, by transforming it into a critique , not only of the observed sense-data of the physical world, but also of man the observer. Starting with Eddington, Jeans, Max Planck, Einstein, Shrodinger, Niels Bohr, Heisenberg, and other great creators of twentieth-century physics, this philosophical trend has grown through the last five decades, culminating in The Tao of Physics of Berkeley University Physics Professor, Dr.Fritjof Capra.\nConcluding his Space, Time and Gravitation, Eddington hinted at the emergence of the mystery of man from the study of the mystery of physical nature:\n\"The theory of relativity has passed in review the whole subject-matter of physics. It has unified the great laws which, by the precision of their formulation and the exactness of their application, have won the proud place in human knowledge which physical science holds today. And yet, in regard to the nature of things, this knowledge is only an empty shell- a form of symbols. It is knowledge of structural form, and not knowledge of content. All through the physical world runs that unknown content, which must surely be the stuff of our consciousness.\nHere is a hint of aspects deep within the world of physics, and yet unattainable by the methods of physics. And, moreover, we have found that, where science has progressed the farthest, the mind has but regained from nature that which the mind has put into nature. We have found a strange footprint on the shores of the unknown. We have devised profound theories, one after another, to account for its origin. At last, we have succeeded in reconstructing the creature that made the footprint. And lo! It is our own.\"\nHints such as these, given by the earlier philosopher-scientists, have developed into positive affirmations in Dr.Capra. The very title of his book: \u0091The Tao of Physics\u0092, is significant in this connection, apart from the masterly and fascinating exposition he gives, in the course of the book, of his main thesis that:\n\"the basic elements of the Eastern world-view are also those of the world-view emerging from modern physics,\"\nand that:\n\"Eastern thought, and more generally, mystical thought, provide a consistent and relevant philosophical background to the theories of contemporary science.\"\nNoting that, through the two centuries of association with the philosophy of materialism and the contemporary reaction against the ravages wrought by over-technology, the image of science in the eyes of modern man has suffered much damage, Capra seeks to restore the image of pure science as the discipline in the pursuit of truth and human excellence, not in opposition but in tune with the spiritual heritage of man, and more especially, of the spiritual heritage of the East:\nCapra writes:\n\"This book aims at improving the image of science by showing that there is an essential harmony between the spirit of Eastern wisdom and Western science. It attempts to suggest that modern physics goes far beyond technology, that the way\u0096or Tao-of physics can be a path with a heart, a way to spiritual knowledge and self-realisation.\"\nEchoing the voice of Vedanta and all mystical thought that the fundamental search for reality takes man beyond the senses and the sensory world of phenomena, Capra says:\n\"On this journey to the world of the infinitely small, the most important step, from a philosophical point of view, was the first one: the step into the world of atoms. Probing inside the atom and investigating its structure, science transcended the limits of our sensory imagination. From this point on, it could no longer rely with absolute certainty on logic and common sense. Atomic physics provided the scientists with the first glimpses of the essential nature of things. Like the mystics, physicists were now dealing with a non-sensory experience of reality and, like the mystics, they had to face the paradoxical aspects of this experience. From then on, therefore, the models and images of modern physics became akin to those of Eastern philosophy.\"\nReferring to the basic unity of the universe, as upheld in Eastern mysticism and modern physics, Capra says:\n\"The most important characteristic of the Eastern world-view- one could almost say the essence of it- is the awareness of the unity and mutual interrelation of all things and events\u0085. The Eastern traditions constantly refer to this ultimate indivisible reality, which manifests itself in all things, and of which all things are parts. It is called Brahman in Hinduism, Dharmakaya in Buddhism, and Tao in Taoism\u0085\"\n\"The basic oneness of the universe is not only the central characteristic of the mystical experience, but is also one of the most important revelations of modern physics. It becomes apparent at the atomic level, and manifests itself more and more as one penetrates deeper into matter, down into the realm of sub-atomic particles. The unity of all things and events will be a recurring theme throughout our comparison of modern physics and the Eastern philosophy.\"\nBoth speak of reality as transcending space, time, and causality. Referring to this kinship, Dr.Capra says:\n\"The space-time of relativistic physics is a similar timeless space of a higher dimension. All events in it are interconnected, but the connections are not causal. Particle interactions can be interpreted in terms of cause and effect only when the space-time diagrams are read in a definite direction, e.g., from the bottom to the top. When they are taken as four dimensional patterns without any definite direction of time attached to them, there is no \u0091before\u0092 and no \u0091after\u0092, and thus no causation\".\n\"Similarly, the Eastern mystics assert that, in transcending time, they also transcend the world of cause and effect. Like our ordinary notions of space and time, causation is an idea which is limited to a certain experience of the world and has to be abandoned when this experience is extended. In the words of Swami Vivekananda (Jnana Yoga):\n\u0091Time, space, and causation are like the glass through which the Absolute is seen. \u0085 In the Absolute there is neither time, space, nor causation.\u0092 \u0096Swami Vivekananda\nCapra continues:\n\"The Eastern spiritual traditions show their followers various ways of going beyond the ordinary experience of time and of freeing themselves from the chain of cause and effect- from the bondage of Karma, as the Hindus and Buddhists say. It has therefore been said that Eastern mysticism is a liberation from time. The same may be said of relativistic physics.\"\nAgain Capra says:\n\"Subsequent to the emergence of the field concept, physicists have attempted to unify the various fields into a single fundamental field which would incorporate all physical phenomena. Einstein, in particular, spent the last years of his life searching for such a unified field. The Brahman of the Hindus, like the Dharmakaya of the Buddhists, and the Tao of the Taoists, can be seen, perhaps, as the ultimate unified field, from which spring not only the phenomena studied in physics, but all other phenomena as well\"\n\"In the Eastern view, the reality underlying all phenomena is beyond all forms and defies all description and specification. It is, therefore, often said to be formless, empty, or void. But this emptiness is not to be taken for mere nothingness. It is, on the contrary, the essence of all forms and the source of all life. Thus the Upanishads say (Chandogya Upanishad, 4-10-4):\n\u0091Brahman is life, Brahman is joy.\nBrahman is the void.\nJoy ,verily, that is the same as the void.\nThe void, verily, that is the same as joy\u0092\".\nAtomic physics is confronted with the problem of consciousness through the datum of the \u0091observer\u0092 or to use the new, and more meaningful term coined by physicist John Wheeler, \u0091participator.\u0092 Accordingly, Dr.Capra says:\n\"In modern physics, the question of consciousness has arisen in connection with the observation of atomic phenomena. Quantum theory has made it clear that these phenomena can only be understood as links in a chain of processes, the end of which lies in the consciousness of the human observer. In the words of Eugene Wigner (Symmetries and Reflections- Scientific Essays):\n\u0091It was not possible to formulate the laws (of quantum theory) in a fully consistent way without reference to consciousness.\u0092 \u0096 Eugene Wigner\nDr.Capra continues:\n\"The pragmatic formulation of quantum theory used by the scientists in their work does not refer to their consciousness explicitly. Wigner and other physicists have argued, however, that the explicit inclusion of human consciousness may be an essential aspect of future theories of matter.\"\n\"Such a development would open exciting possibilities for a direct interaction between physics and Eastern mysticism. The understanding of one\u0092s consciousness and its relation to the rest of the universe is the starting point of all mystical experience. \u0085 If physicists really want to include the nature of human consciousness in their realm of research, a study of Eastern ideas may well provide them with stimulating new viewpoints.\"\nReferring to spiritual kinship between modern science and ancient Vedanta, Swami Vivekananda said in his speech at the Parliament of Religions held at Chicago in 1893:\n\"Manifestation, and not creation, is the word of science today, and the Hindu is only glad that what he has been cherishing in his bosom for ages is going to be taught in more forcible language, and with further light, from the latest conclusions of science.\"\nConfirming this view of Swami Vivekananda, that the physicist and the mystic reach the truth of unity, though following different approaches, Dr.Capra says:\n\"In contrast to the mystic, the physicist begins his inquiry into the essential nature of things by studying the material world. Penetrating into ever deeper realms of matter, he has become aware of the essential unity of all things and events. More than that, he has also learnt that he himself and his consciousness are an integral part of this unity. Thus the mystic and the physicist arrive at the same conclusion; one starting from the inner realm, the other from the outer world. The harmony between their views confirms the ancient Indian wisdom that Brahman, the ultimate reality, is identical to Atman, the reality within.\"\nConclusion\nUnderstood in this light, there is no conflict between science and religion, between the physical sciences and the science of spirituality. Both have the identical aim of discovering truth and helping man to grow physically, mentally, and spiritually, and achieve fulfilment. But each by itself is insufficient and helpless. They have been tried separately with unsatisfactory results. The older civilisations took guidance mostly from religion; their achievements were partial and limited. Modern civilisation relies solely on science; its achievements also have turned out to be partial and limited.\nThe combination today, of the spiritual energies of these two complementary disciplines in the life of man will produce fully integrated human beings, and thus help to evolve a complete human civilisation, for which the world is ripe and waiting. This is the most outstanding contribution of Swami Vivekananda to human thought today. This synthetic vision of his finds lucid expression in a brief but comprehensive testament of his Vedantic conviction:\n\" Each soul is potentially divine.\nThe goal of life is to manifest this divinity within by controlling nature, external (through physical sciences, technology, and socio-political processes) and internal (through ethical, aesthetic, and religious processes):\nDo this either by work, or worship, or psychic control, or philosophy-by one, or more, or all of these-and be free.\nThis is the whole of religion. Doctrines or dogmas or rituals or books or temples or forms, are but secondary details.\"\n-Swami Vivekananda\nThis science and technique for realising the true glory of man, followed with scientific thoroughness and detachment by the sages of the Upanishads, and revalidated by a succession of spiritual experimenters down the ages from Buddha to Ramakrishna, is glowingly revealed in one of the immortal verses of the Svetasvatara Upanishad:\n\"Hear, ye children of immortal bliss, even ye that reside in higher spheres! I have found the Ancient One, who is beyond all darkness, all delusion; knowing Him alone, you shall be saved from death over again.\"\nRelated articles\n"}, {"score": 2449.6497, "uuid": "fc282cf3-fc81-5455-bac7-8dda3f2c2a76", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0908wb-96-19238", "target_hostname": "www.hinduism.co.za", "target_uri": "http://www.hinduism.co.za/hinduism.htm", "page_rank": 1.5035033e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "Hinduism &amp; <em>Quantum</em> <em>Physics</em>", "snippet": "<em>What</em> <em>is</em> crucial <em>is</em> that, according to <em>the</em> theory of relativity, a sharp distinction <em>between</em> space <em>and</em> time cannot be maintained.

The understanding of one\u0092s consciousness and its relation to the rest of the universe is the starting point of all mystical experience. \u0085 If physicists really want to include the nature of human consciousness in their realm of research, a study of Eastern ideas may well provide them with stimulating new viewpoints.\"\nReferring to spiritual kinship between modern science and ancient Vedanta, Swami Vivekananda said in his speech at the Parliament of Religions held at Chicago in 1893:\n\"Manifestation, and not creation, is the word of science today, and the Hindu is only glad that what he has been cherishing in his bosom for ages is going to be taught in more forcible language, and with further light, from the latest conclusions of science.\"\nConfirming this view of Swami Vivekananda, that the physicist and the mystic reach the truth of unity, though following different approaches, Dr.Capra says:\n\"In contrast to the mystic, the physicist begins his inquiry into the essential nature of things by studying the material world. Penetrating into ever deeper realms of matter, he has become aware of the essential unity of all things and events. More than that, he has also learnt that he himself and his consciousness are an integral part of this unity. Thus the mystic and the physicist arrive at the same conclusion; one starting from the inner realm, the other from the outer world. The harmony between their views confirms the ancient Indian wisdom that Brahman, the ultimate reality, is identical to Atman, the reality within.\"\nConclusion\nUnderstood in this light, there is no conflict between science and religion, between the physical sciences and the science of spirituality. Both have the identical aim of discovering truth and helping man to grow physically, mentally, and spiritually, and achieve fulfilment. But each by itself is insufficient and helpless. They have been tried separately with unsatisfactory results. The older civilisations took guidance mostly from religion; their achievements were partial and limited. Modern civilisation relies solely on science; its achievements also have turned out to be partial and limited.\nThe combination today, of the spiritual energies of these two complementary disciplines in the life of man will produce fully integrated human beings, and thus help to evolve a complete human civilisation, for which the world is ripe and waiting. This is the most outstanding contribution of Swami Vivekananda to human thought today. This synthetic vision of his finds lucid expression in a brief but comprehensive testament of his Vedantic conviction:\n\" Each soul is potentially divine.\nThe goal of life is to manifest this divinity within by controlling nature, external (through physical sciences, technology, and socio-political processes) and internal (through ethical, aesthetic, and religious processes):\nDo this either by work, or worship, or psychic control, or philosophy-by one, or more, or all of these-and be free.\nThis is the whole of religion. Doctrines or dogmas or rituals or books or temples or forms, are but secondary details.\"\n-Swami Vivekananda\nThis science and technique for realising the true glory of man, followed with scientific thoroughness and detachment by the sages of the Upanishads, and revalidated by a succession of spiritual experimenters down the ages from Buddha to Ramakrishna, is glowingly revealed in one of the immortal verses of the Svetasvatara Upanishad:\n\"Hear, ye children of immortal bliss, even ye that reside in higher spheres! I have found the Ancient One, who is beyond all darkness, all delusion; knowing Him alone, you shall be saved from death over again.\"\nRelated articles\n"}, {"score": 2449.4504, "uuid": "092d93e4-5fe4-5681-b75d-19bdccbaf1a5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0104wb-61-17874", "target_hostname": "www.csicop.org", "target_uri": "http://www.csicop.org/si/show/why_quantum_mechanics_is_not_so_weird_after_all/", "page_rank": 1.1864391e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "CSI | Why <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em> <em>Is</em> Not So Weird after All", "snippet": "<em>The</em> headline \u201c<em>Physics</em> Cannot Predict <em>the</em> Future in Detail\u201d should be no great embarrassment. 2) <em>Quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em> means that there <em>is</em> a kind of instant awareness <em>between</em> everything.", "explanation": null, "document": "A full report will be available in the January/February issue of Skeptical Inquirer\nWhy Quantum Mechanics Is Not So Weird after All\nShare:\nVolume 30.4, July / August 2006\nRichard Feynman\u2019s \u201cleast-action\u201d approach to quantum physics in effect shows that it is just classical physics constrained by a simple mechanism. When the complicated mathematics is left aside, valuable insights are gained.\nThe birth of quantum mechanics can be dated to 1925, when physicists such as Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger invented mathematical procedures that accurately replicated many of the observed properties of atoms. The change from earlier types of physics was dramatic, and pre-quantum physics was soon called classical physics in a kind of nostalgia for the days when waves were waves, particles were particles, and everything knew its place in the world.\nSince 1925, quantum mechanics has never looked back. It soon became clear that the new methods were not just good at accounting for the properties of atoms, they were absolutely central to explaining why atoms did not collapse, how solids can be rigid, and how different atoms combine together in what we call chemistry and biology. The rules of classical physics, far from being a reliable description of the everyday world that breaks down at the scale of the atom, turned out to be incapable of explaining anything much more complicated than how planets orbit the sun, unless they used either the results of quantum mechanics or a lot of ad hoc assumptions.\nBut this triumph of quantum mechanics came with an unexpected problem-when you stepped outside of the mathematics and tried to explain what was going on, it didn't seem to make any sense. Elementary particles such as electrons behave like waves, apparently moving like ripples on a pond; they also seem to be instantaneously aware of distant objects and to be in different places at the same time. It seemed that any weird idea could gain respectability by finding similarities with some of the weird features of quantum mechanics. It has become almost obligatory to declare that quantum physics, in contrast to classical physics, cannot be understood, and that we should admire its ability to give the right answers without thinking about it too hard.\nAnd yet, eighty years and unprecedented numbers of physicists later, naked quantum weirdness remains elusive. There are plenty of quantum phenomena, from the magnetism of iron and the superconductivity of lead to lasers and electronics, but none of them really qualifies as truly bizarre in the way we might expect. The greatest mystery of quantum mechanics is how its ideas have remained so weird while it explained more and more about the world around us.\nPerhaps it is time to revisit the ideas with the benefit of hindsight, to see if either quantum mechanics is less weird than we usually think it is or the world around us is more so.\nClassical Mechanics in Action\nFigure 2. Classical mechanics-Maupertuis\u2019 view: the ball moves in a straight line at a constant speed to any given point on its travels, because that is the path of least action between the start and finish.\nWhen we think of planets orbiting the sun, we usually adopt Newton\u2019s view that they are constantly accelerating-in this case changing direction-in response to gravitational forces. From this, we can calculate the motions precisely, and the impressive accuracy of predictions for total solar eclipses shows how well it works.\nThere is, however, another way of thinking about what is happening that gives exactly the same results. Instead of the Principle of Acceleration by Forces, as we might call it, there is an alternative called the Principle of Least Action, or more correctly, Hamilton\u2019s Principle.\nIt is a principle that was first put forward about fifty years after Newton\u2019s, in its earliest form by the Frenchman Pierre Maupertuis, and in its ultimate form by the Irishman William Rowan Hamilton.\nThe general idea is that when a planet travels through space, or a ball travels through the air, the path that is followed is the one that minimizes something called the action between the start and end points. Action, for our purposes here, is just something that can be measured out for some particular object moving along a particular path. It is exactly defined and is measured in units of energy multiplied by time. The details are not important unless you need to make calculations.\nWe therefore have two quite different ways of describing situations in classical physics that are equally good in terms of giving the right answer. To give the simplest possible example, we can think of a golf ball travelling across an idealized, frictionless, flat green. In Newton\u2019s view (figure 1), the ball moves in a straight line at constant speed, because that is what Newton\u2019s Law says it must do. In Maupertuis\u2019 view (figure 2), the ball does this because this path is the one that has the least action between the start and end points. This trivial example can be made more interesting by making the green have humps and dips, which are like having forces acting on the ball, but the principles stay the same.\nHamilton\u2019s Principle is fundamentally equivalent to Newton\u2019s Laws, and comes into its own when solving more advanced types of classical problems. But as an explanation, it has a major flaw-it seems to mean that things need to know where they are going before they work out how to get there.\nActually, this is where classical mechanics makes its first big step toward quantum mechanics, if only we look at it another way. The mathematics of Hamilton\u2019s Principle can be described in words alternatively like this: given its starting points and motion, an object will end up at locations that are connected to its starting point by a path whose action is a minimum compared to neighboring paths. If locations away from the classical path are considered, no such paths exist-there will always be a path with the least action, but this is not a minimum.\nIt is an unfamiliar idea, but well worth a little effort to try and digest. One vital change to note is that, while still being classical physics, the emphasis has moved away from knowing the path that is followed to having a test to check whether possible destinations are on the right track. And the crucial factor is being able to compare the actions of different paths.\nIt leads to a third picture for our moving golf ball, central to the later move to quantum physics, which we can call Feynman\u2019s view of classical physics (figure 3).\nFigure 3: Classical mechanics-Feynman\u2019s view: the ball is found at the black points, which happen to lie on a straight line, and not the white points, because only the black points pass the \u201caction test.\u201d This means that there is a path from the start to the black points whose action is a minimum compared to neighboring paths, but there is no such path from the start to the white spots.\nIf we stay within the world of classical physics, we can choose to ignore this strange new description and stick with the more comfortable idea that things are accelerated along paths by forces, but this would be a personal preference rather than a rational one. The new view prompts the question: \u201cHow do things work out whether possible destinations are linked to the start by a path of minimal action?\u201d We should appreciate, however, that the old Newtonian view prompts equally difficult questions like: \u201cHow do things respond to forces by accelerating just the required amount, instant by instant?\u201d Moreover, as we will see, the action version is the one that the world around us seems to use.\nRoll on, Quantum Mechanics\nSuppose we take the action question seriously and give it a rather simple answer: Nature has to check out all possible destinations to see if they are on the right track. It must do this by trying to find out if there is a path of minimal action to each destination. It uses a device that can measure the action along all possible paths to each destination.\nThe device is a simple surveyor\u2019s wheel for measuring action-just a wheel with a mark on the rim (figure 4). There isn't literally a type of wheel that measures action, but we can imagine that there is. The mechanism assigns probabilities to each destination according to whether, with just this simple measuring tool, it can find a path of minimal action.\nFigure 4: The single most potent image of quantum mechanics- a surveyor\u2019s wheel for measuring action\nWhen the actions it is trying to measure are large compared to the size of the wheel, the system typically works just as classical physics requires. But in some situations the mechanism fails to produce classical mechanics and gives us quantum mechanics instead. We call the circumference of the wheel \u201cPlanck\u2019s constant,\u201d after Max Planck, who discovered its importance by an indirect route in 1900.\nYou may be wondering how exactly the wheel can tell us what we need to know, but we don't need to go into the details here-those interested should read Richard Feynman\u2019s book, QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter, or see the summary given in the box on page 43.\nDifferences from Classical Physics\nAs we might expect, the introduction of a mechanism for carrying out classical mechanics only makes a difference when the mechanism can't do its job properly. Specifically, if we want to check out destinations that are too close to the start, as gauged by the size of the wheel, the mechanism doesn't work. It cannot say where the object should be going, and there is an intrinsic fuzziness associated with it, with a scale set by the amount of action known as Planck\u2019s constant. This is otherwise known as the Uncertainty Principle.\nA second feature arises from the simple circular nature of the measuring device. It cannot tell the difference between paths that differ by an amount of action that is an exact whole number of Planck\u2019s constants. This can lead to patterns of probabilities that look just like classical waves, because the mathematics of waves is very similar to the mathematics of circular motion.\nThe most important change comes when we consider objects in very small orbits, like electrons around nuclei. The mechanism gives zero probability unless the orbit (or more correctly the state) has an action that is an exact multiple of Planck\u2019s constant. This crude mechanism explains why atoms can only shrink to a certain point, to a state with an action of Planck\u2019s constant, where they become stable.\nWith one extra idea, which we will mention later, the mechanism seems to explain the workings of chemistry, biology, and all the other successes of quantum mechanics, without ever really stopping being classical mechanics.\nThree Conceptual Problems with Quantum Mechanics\nThe way it is normally introduced, quantum mechanics is something quite baffling, and certainly stranger than just classical mechanics with a mechanism. It is worth addressing the three most obvious difficulties directly:\n1) Quantum mechanics gives answers that are a set of probabilities all existing at the same time. This is totally unreal. As Schr\u00f6dinger pointed out, quantum mechanics seems to say that you could create a situation where a cat was both alive and dead at the same time, and we never see this. But this is in fact a very curious piece of ammunition to use against quantum mechanics.\nWe already have a very good nontechnical word for a mixture of possibilities coexisting at the same time-we call it the future. Unless we believe that all events are predetermined, which would be a very dismal view of the world, this is what the future must be like. Of course, we never experience it until it becomes the present, when only one of the possibilities takes place, but the actual future-as opposed to our prediction of one version of it-must be something much like what quantum mechanics describes. This is a great triumph for quantum mechanics over classical mechanics, which by describing all events as inevitable, effectively deprived us of a future.\nOf course, there is now a new big question of how one of the possibilities in the future is selected to form what we see as the present and what becomes the past, but we should not see the lack of a ready answer as a fault of quantum mechanics. This is a question that is large enough, encompassing such ideas as fate and free will, to be set aside for another time. The headline \u201cPhysics Cannot Predict the Future in Detail\u201d should be no great embarrassment.\n2) Quantum mechanics means that there is a kind of instant awareness between everything. This is quite true, but by introducing quantum mechanics in the way that we have, the \u201cawareness\u201d is of a very limited kind-limited to the awareness gained through the action-measuring mechanism as it checks all possible destinations. It is very hard to see how the only result of this-a probability associated with each destination-could be used to send a signal faster than light or violate any other cherished principle. It is rather revealing that one of the few novel quantum phenomena is a means of cryptography-a way of concealing a signal rather than sending one.\n3) Quantum mechanics doesn't allow us to say where everything is, every instant of the time. This is the most interesting \u201cfault\u201d of quantum mechanics, and it can be expressed in many ways: particles need to be in more than one place at a time; their positions are not defined until they are \u201cobserved\"; they behave like waves. We will summarize this as an inability to say exactly where particles are all the time.\nThe \u201cclassic\u201d illustration of this is the experiment of passing a steady stream of electrons through two slits (figure 5). Instead of the simple shadows we would expect if the particles were just particles, we see an interference pattern, as if the electrons have dematerialized into a wave and passed through both slits at the same time.\nFigure 5: A schematic diagram of the two-slits experiment\nThere are several ways of coming to terms with this. The first thing to note is that the lack of complete information is not really a problem that arose in quantum mechanics-it originates in the third version of classical mechanics. In the Feynman version, the essence of motion is a process of determining if a destination is on or off the right track. Before the move to quantum mechanics, we can do this as often as we like, so that we can fill in the gaps as closely as we like, but the precedent has been set: physics is about testing discrete locations rather than calculating continuous trajectories. If it is inherent in old-fashioned classical physics, not just \u201cweird\u201d quantum physics, perhaps we can relax a little.\nThe second point is to clarify what the problem is. To take the two-slit example, we never see electrons dematerialize, or rippling through something, we just find it necessary to think that they do to explain the pattern that we see on the screen. If we deliberately try to observe where the electrons go, we see them as particles somewhere else, but the interference pattern disappears. In effect, the problem is that we cannot say what the particles look like only when they cannot be seen.\nNow this is an uncomfortable thought, because all our instincts tell us that particles must be somewhere, even when we cannot see them. But if quantum mechanics can accurately describe all the information we can ever obtain about the outside world, perhaps we are simply being greedy to ask for anything more. The headline \u201cPhysics Fails to Describe Events That Cannot Be Observed\u201d is, again, rather lacking in impact.\nThe final point is a little vague but more fundamental. If we accept that the future is not fixed, we expect it to contain surprises. Crudely speaking, this is not very plausible in a world where particles have continuous trajectories and an infinite amount of information is freely available. It is much more plausible in a world that is in some way discontinuous, where the available information is limited. Even though we have set aside the question of how a future full of possibilities turns into an unchanging past, it must involve something that seems pretty weird compared to our normal experience. Perhaps this example of physics not conforming to our expectations is weirdness of the right sort.\nThe Addition of Spin\nIt was mentioned earlier that another new idea is needed before the classical physics of electrons and nuclei properly turns into chemistry. That idea is spin, a third property of electrons and nuclei alongside mass and electrical charge. Paul Dirac showed that spin is a natural property of charged particles within quantum mechanics. Wolfgang Pauli showed that the spin of the electron prevents more than one electron occupying the same state at the same time-the Exclusion Principle-a fact responsible for the whole of chemistry. The details are not important here, but quantum mechanics with spin seems to account for pretty much all the world we see around us.\nQuantum Mechanics-Bringer of Stability\nOne of the benefits of viewing the quantum world as not fundamentally different from the classical world is that we can imagine how one changes into the other. With a few simple assumptions, a classical world of point-like electrons and nuclei is blindingly chaotic. Atoms are continually trying to collapse, but are prevented from doing so by the huge amount of electromagnetic radiation that is released in the process. It is not the comfortable place that the word classical implies.\nAs we imagine moving to the quantum realm by increasing the size of Planck\u2019s constant from zero, something remarkable happens. At some point, the blinding light disappears to reveal stable atoms, capable of forming molecules. Far from making everything go weird, quantum mechanics makes it go normal. To be sure, if Planck\u2019s constant increases too far, the atoms fall apart and a different form of chaos takes over, but that just makes the story even more interesting.\nSo it seems that quantum physics is not weird and incomprehensible because it describes something completely different from everyday reality. It is weird and incomprehensible precisely because it describes the world we see around us-past, present, and future.\nReference\nFeynman, Richard P. 1985.

For me, it is so reasonable to assume that the photons in those experiments carry with them programs, which have been correlated in advance, telling them how to behave. This is so rational that I think that when Einstein saw that, and the others refused to see it, he was the rational man. The other people, although history has justified them, were burying their heads in the sand.

In the world as it exists apart from observation, matter and energy consist of waves\nthat are deterministically governed by Schr\u00f6dinger's Equation. The waves have an undoubted physical reality because of the interference effects that can be observed, and because the three dimensional size of atoms is due to the state of their electrons as three dimensional standing waves -- otherwise there is nothing to \"fill the space\" of atoms, except particles somehow being everywhere at once, which they can't be because in changing directions to get here and there they would radiate energy. (Fields can be said to fill the space, but this only postpones the problem, since fields in quantum mechanics are exchanges of virtual particles.) On the other hand, the square of the wave function gives a probability distribution for where discrete particles may be found once the wave function is collapsed by an act of observation. The wave function thus contains the sum of all possible states of a system until it is observed. This produces the paradox of Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat, who is both alive and dead at the same time, in just that proportion as each state is probable.\nThe act of observation, which collapses the wave function, is conformable to the Kantian act of synthesis, by which phenomenal objects are introduced into consciousness and subjected to the categories of the understanding. Niels Bohr's own Principle of Complementarity was that matter and energy could exhibit wave properties, or particle properties, but never both at the same time. If what Kantian consciousness requires is discrete actual things in space and time, this is exactly what is delivered in quantum mechanics: Bohr stipulated that observers and their equipment would never be subject to quantum mechanical probability effects. Around us, for Bohr, we maintain a little, discrete, actual, Classical universe.\nKant did not view things-in-themselves as containing the sum of all possibilities, and phenomena all actualities; but this duality is conformable to Kant's metaphysics as to none other. As a contribution to the metaphysics of possibility, the quantum mechanical wave function can easily be seen as complementary to Kant's idea of things-in-themselves, where various kinds of things can happen (like free will) that are not comprehensible in terms of phenomenal reality. Kant would just have to allow that characteristics of physical reality can intrude some depth into things-in-themselves, which he would not have considered -- though we can also handle this by positing an intermediate level of reality,\nbetween true unconditioned things-in-themselves and true discrete phenomenal objects. The wave function straddles the classic Kantian boundary, sharing some properties with phenomena, others with things-in-themselves.\nThus, where Kant would have considered all of phenomena governed by determinism, we now see the wave function as deterministic, while the collapse of waves into particles is random. Although chance in quantum mechanics has often been argued as allowing for free will , a free cause is still a very different thing from a random cause, which doesn't need mind or self or intention. Moral freedom is thus still left among things-in-themselves.\nKant's idea that space and time do not exist among things-in-themselves has been curiously affirmed by Relativity and quantum mechanics. In Relativity, time simply ceases to pass at the velocity of light: \u00a0for photons that have travelled to us as part of the Cosmic Background Radiation, time has stood still for most of the history of the universe. On the other hand, quantum mechanics now posits \"non-locality,\" i.e. physical distances, and so the limitation of the velocity of light in Relativity, don't seem to exist. This means that although time may apply to the wave function, space may not. The full empirical reality of space is only found among discrete particles and objects.\nThis curious result is the consequence of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Paradox, which was intended by Einstein as a reductio ad absurdum of quantum mechanics. If, for instance, a positron and an election are both created from an energetic photon, the conservation of angular momentum requires that one be spinning one way, and the other the other. But the complementary spins are equally probable for each particle. Thus, in quantum mechanical terms, the wave functions of each particle divide without a discrete state being determined. The particles might then separate to even cosmological distances, but as soon as the spin of one particle is observed, the other particle must have the opposite spin, which means that the wave function has collapsed across those cosmological distances and caused the other particle to assume a predictable spin. If this occurs instantaneously, it would violate the limitation of the velocity of light in Special Relativity.\nThis has now been shown to actually occur on the basis of Bell's Theorem (from John Bell, 1928-1990), meaning that Quantum Mechanics does violate Special Relativity by allowing instantaneous interactions across even cosmological distances. However, once observed, processes must still obey Special Relativity and the limitations of spatial distance, creating the kind of duality described by Kant. Bell himself found this result disturbing, but to Kant it would fit in with his own theory that space is only imposed by the representation of phenomenal objects.\nEinstein always objected to quantum mechanics because his metaphysical realism recoiled from the idea that observation would create a different kind of reality than what existed independently. At first Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle could be interpreted as meaning that the act of observation would physically disturb a system in an ordinary and realistic way, but then it soon became evident that strange things were allowed to happen in the wave function that not only could not be observed but could not even be conceived in ordinary and realistic ways. Reality existed in a different way while under observation than it did in itself.\nNow, the original philosophical theory which advocated something of the sort, that observation (the synthesis of objects in consciousness) imposes certain forms and rules before things can appear as phenomenal objects, was indeed that of Kant. Einstein and all his contemporaries must have been aware that there was something familiar about the emerging quantum world. The outright anti-realism of Bohr's Copenhagen Interpretation, although the focus of conflict, was only one historical possibility. Kant's empirical realism and transcendental idealism was another. But I have not noticed Kant receiving any kind of notice or credit for a theory that would address some of the paradoxes produced by quantum mechanics, denying the independence of physical reality from the presence of human consciousness. Since nothing is so characteristic of Kantian philosophy than that principle, perhaps it is only a matter of time before philosophers pull their heads out of the \"post-modernist\" hole in the ground and pay attention. Physicists, of course, don't have to care, unless they hear the call of metaphysics as well as physics.\nSince this page was originally posted, one of the most notable responses was from a correspondent who was indignant that the views of David Bohm (1917-1992) and other alternative theories about quantum mechanics were not presented. The purpose of this site, however, is to develop and apply Kantian and Friesian philosophy, and not necessarily to examine every other theory that other people may find important or definitive. Since Kant's was the original philosophical theory in which the observer imposes conditions on the nature of objects, it is arguably an interpretation with historical and conceptual priority. Thus, since it usually is not given much credit for this, it deserves some extra attention, as provided here.\nNow, however, some additional comment may be in order, after I was struck by the treatment of recent developments in quantum mechanics in a centennial article in the February 2001 Scientific American, \"100 Years of Quantum Mysteries,\" by Max Tegmark and the historic physicist (e.g. a teacher of Richard Feynman ) John Archibald Wheeler (pp.68-75 -- Wheeler died, aged 96, in 2008). According to Tegmark and Wheeler, the recent trend is to try and preserve the determinism of the wave function, substituting for discrete particles more localized waves whose interference or interaction has been aborted by \"decoherence,\" in which superpositions of wave functions are \"dissipated\" by \"tiny interactions with the surrounding environment.\"\nThis is the complete opposite of an approach like that of Bohm, who, like Einstein, believed that discrete particles with definite locations are always present. That would now be called a \"hidden variable\" theory, i.e. that the quantities for the location of the particles are there, but are hidden from observation. It is frequently said that the success of Bell's Theorem rules out all hidden variable theories, but Bohm's is an exception to this. The clarification seems to be that local hidden variable theories were ruled out; but Bohm's is a non-local theory. Bohm postulated a new force, the \"quantum potential,\" to account for the wave-like and interference effects between particles. The \"quantum potential\" itself takes the form of a wave, a \"guide wave\" or \"pilot wave,\" which directs the motion of the particles. Bohm thus combines wave and particle theory, preserving the realism of particles but accounting for wave effects with the action of the pilot wave. The quantum potential field and pilot waves, however, have unique properties. They act non-locally, so that the wave does transmit the EPR information instantaneously without losing any strength, and the wave is able to guide the motion of particles without any energy being involved. As a good quantum theory, the \"quantum potential\" field theory also might be expected to postulate the existence of particles that mediate the field, but this does not seem to be part of it -- and it would be awkward, because even virtual particles, which mediate forces in quantum mechanics, observe the limitations of Relativity. Later, Bohm assimilated the quantum potential into a larger theory of the \"implicate order,\" in which a hidden order, unity, and wholeness underlies all reality and accounts for all quantum effects, including the non-locality evident in the result of Bell's Theorem.

Norton & Company, 2000] describes this as asserting that the separating particles in the EPR case are actually the same particle in a higher dimension [p.77].\nNow, it is a respectable and venerable practice in physics to postulate new forces. For such theories to gain popularity, however, there is a great deal to overcome, not the least of which is just Ockham's Razor. If the main reason to have the \"quantum potential\" is just to preserve a realism and determinism about particles, then most physicists are not going to get too excited. The \"implicate order,\" on the other hand, is a large dose of metaphysics. Just as that may make the theory more attractive to theosophists, it is going to turn off mainstream physics, which is probably why Bohm's name is not even mentioned in Tegmark and Wheeler's article. The implication there is that the hidden variable theories are finished and that the hope for a deterministic quantum mechanics will be found in dealing with the wave function, eliminating discrete particles altogether.\nHowever, it is evident in the article's own terms that even \"decoherence\" doesn't help much with the basic quantum mechanical dilemmas about possibility. Thus, although it does not occur in the main text, the insert on page 73 contains the telling admission, \"Decoherence does not completely eliminate the need for an interpretation such as many-worlds or Copenhagen.\" Indeed. This is because even the \"dissipation\" of superpositions still leaves alternative \"classical\" probabilities. The alternative possibilities are either going to have to separate into different worlds, or they are going to have to collapse into just one particle. The insert on page 74 extends the decoherence of different worlds to the mental states of the observer, who can be both happy and sad about the fall of a playing card without the happy or the sad person being aware of the other. This does not seem to help much in eliminating the strangeness of quantum mechanics or the vast metaphysical overkill of the \"many worlds\" interpretation. If the wave function collapses into one particle, or one mental state, however, then this maintains the metaphysical dualism between wave function and particle that both Bohm and the decoherentists want to eliminate.\nCopyright (c) 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010 Kelley L. Ross, Ph.D. All Rights Reserved\nKantian Quantum Mechanics, Note\nA correspondent helpfully provided some references to recent treatments of Kant in relation to Quantum Mechanics, apparently as closely related to Bohr's antirealism -- references which mostly turned out to be listed at \" Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics .\" In should be remembered in this, however, that Kantianism means empirical realism, while, if the wave function is to be placed at a new level among things in themselves, that introduces another element of realism, i.e. the realistic wave function of de Broglie and Schr\u00f6dinger. Bohr, who says \"Nothing exists until it is measured,\" does not have a realistic interpretation of the wave function -- or, for that matter, of reality in general: \u00a0that is precisely what the \"Copenhagen Interpretation\" is. This is starkly different from what Kant's view would be of things in themselves. Bohr was not a Kantian. That Bohr, or even Einstein and G\u00f6del , knew his Kant does not mean that he (or Einstein and G\u00f6del) agreed with him. Indeed, even apart from Kant, Bohr's dictum is profoundly paradoxical, since, if nothing exists before we measure it, we would not be able to find anything to measure. This is like the Logical Positivists asserting that nothing has meaning unless it can be verified, even though we would need to understand that meaning before we could know whether it could be verified or not. (And since the Positivists supposedly accepted Hume's critique of Induction , they should have known that science cannot actually verify much of anything, leaving all of it meaningless -- no less than the conclusion of the Deconstructionists .)\nReturn to Text\nRichard Feynman's Quantum Mechanics\nNow I know that other old men have been very foolish in saying things like this, and, therefore, I would be very foolish to say this is nonsense. I am going to be very foolish, because I do feel strongly that this is nonsense! I can't help it, even though I know the danger in such a point of view. So perhaps I could entertain future historians by saying I think all this superstring stuff is crazy and is in the wrong direction....\nI don't like that they're not calculating anything. I don't like that they don't check their ideas. I don't like that for anything that disagrees with an experiment, they cook up an explanation -- a fix-up to say, \"Well, it still might be true.\" For example, the theory requires ten dimensions. Well, maybe there's a way of wrapping up six of the dimensions. Yes, that's possible mathematically, but why not seven? When they write their equation, the equation should decide how many of these things get wrapped up, not the desire to agree with experiment. In other words, there's no reason whatsoever in superstring theory that it isn't eight of the ten dimensions that get wrapped up and that the result is only two dimensions, which would be completely in disagreement with experience. So the fact that it might disagree with experience is very tenuous, it doesn't produce anything; it has to be excused most of the time. It doesn't look right.\nRichard Feynman, quoted in Not Even Wrong, The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law, by Peter Woit [Basic Books, 2006, p. 174-175]\nIn Richard Feynman's lectures on Quantum Electrodynamics (QED, The Strange Theory of Light and Matter, Princeton University Press, 1985) we get a certain picture of the behavior of sub-atomic particles and its analysis in quantum mechanics. While there may be other sources expressing Feynman's views, these lectures were delivered in 1983, just five years before his death, and so I take them as representative of his mature thought. While Feynman's theory is sometimes described as an alternative to other attempts to work out the metaphysics of quantum mechanics, I do not think that it is complete or consistent enough to qualify for that description -- though it is definitely a distinct mathematical approach. Nevertheless, it illustrates the approach of a great physicist, one who admittedly was very impatient with philosophical issues and who got a charge out of how odd it all was:\nI'm rather delighted that we must resort to such peculiar rules and strange reasoning in order to understand Nature, and I enjoy telling people about it. [p.78]\nOf course, Feynman admits that we don't \"understand Nature.\" On the page before the quote given he frankly says, \"...the way we have to describe Nature is generally incomprehensible to us\" [p.77]. And at the very beginning he warns the reader/auditor of his presentation, \"You're not going to be able to understand it\" [p.9]. We can easily say about this that we understand some things and don't understand others, which is the normal situation in science. With Feynman, however, we get the picture that the stuff we don't understand he has stopped trying to understand:\nI have pointed out these things because the more you see how strangely Nature behaves, the harder it is to make a model that explains how even the simplest phenomena actually work. So theoretical physics has given up on that. [p.82, boldface added]\nIs it normal in science for someone to say that a major branch of science, even the queen of the sciences, has \"given up on\" a major scientific question? When theory and research reach a dead end, certainly, nothing more can be done for the time being, which can certainly be the case with quantum mechanics; but Feynman seems unusually complacent about this. If you reach a dead end, there may be nothing more to do, but you are ready to leap back at it with the slightest hint of a new approach. As a \"curious character,\" Feynman is someone we would expect to be ever ready and eager for that hint.\nThe truth, I think, is that Feynman seems relatively complacent about this because it involves more of a philosophical issue, more of a metaphysical problem, than he is comfortable with or interested in. He likes what he does, and what he does is physics. You don't need the metaphysics to do the physics, and so Feynman does not feel much loss. And, being a bit of an iconoclast, he delights in the strangeness of it all. On the other hand, Feynman is not some kind of positivist or non-cognitivist. If we don't understand how Nature works, this is not because science is some kind of autistic, masturbatory exercise -- something that we just make up, something that is a mere human convention. If our theories about Nature are strange, it is because Nature is strange. Feynman was also pleased, to be sure, with quantum electrodynamics because of its predictive success (cf. the discussion of the observed and calculated magnetic moment of the electron, pp.6-7), which is what really distinguishes him from the \"theorists\" who don't believe that there is any real evidence for any scientific theory, except the forms of social control that impose theories on the mystified and oppressed (betraying the Marxist origin of this kind of stuff).\nWhat is the most striking in Feynman's version of quantum mechanics is his impatience with the wave-particle duality :\nFor many years after Newton, partial reflection by two surfaces was happily explained by a theory of waves, but when experiments were made with very weak light hitting photomultipliers, the wave theory collapsed: \u00a0as the light got dimmer and dimmer, the photomultipliers kept making full-sized clicks -- there were just fewer of them. Light behaved as particles. [pp.23-24, boldface added]\nThis is the key to Feynman's views: \u00a0he likes particles and is not interested in waves. This puts him more in the metaphysical camp of Einstein and the older realists and out of step with the developments detailed above which try and preserve the determinism of the wave function. He definitely doesn't like duality:\nYou had to know which experiment you were analyzing in order to tell if light was waves or particles. This state of confusion was called the \"wave-particle duality\" of light, and it was jokingly said by someone that light was waves on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; it was particles on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and on Sundays, we think about it! It is the purpose of these lectures to tell you how this puzzle was finally \"resolved.\" [p.23, note]\nThe puzzle, however, was not \"resolved,\" which may be why Feynman here carefully puts that word in \"scare\" quotes. We get a fuller statement here:\n...the wave theory cannot explain how the detector makes equally loud clicks as the light gets dimmer. Quantum electrodynamics \"resolves\" this wave-particle duality by saying that light is made of particles (as Newton originally thought), but the price of this great advancement of science is a retreat by physics to the position of being able to calculate only the probability that a photon will hit a detector, without offering a good model of how it actually happens. [p.37]\nIt is worse than that, since Feynman himself must say that the light goes everywhere at once, follows all possible paths, which is something a single finite particle can't do, regardless of the probability of where it may be found by a detector (cf. p.46, about diffraction gratings). So the wave-particle duality is not so easily \"resolved.\" Indeed, Feynman himself later describes rather well how the wave-particle duality works:\nNature has got it cooked up so we'll never be able to figure out how She does it: \u00a0if we put instruments in to find out which way the light goes, we can find out, all right, but the wonderful interference effects disappear. But if we don't have instruments that can tell which way the light goes, the interference effects come back! Very strange, indeed! [p.81]\nWith this, we don't need the \"Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\" rule. If we know where the particle is, then clearly it can't be everywhere, and the effects that depend on it being everywhere (interference, diffraction), disappear. If we don't know where the particle is, then all the effects explicable by wave mechanics appear. When the cat is away, the mice will play.\nBut Feynman also retreats occasionally from his flat \"light is made of particles\" assertion:\nIn fact, both objects [i.e. electrons and photons] behave somewhat like waves, and somewhat like particles. In order to save ourselves from inventing new words such as \"wavicles,\" we have chosen to call these objects \"particles.\" [p.85]\nSo now they aren't really particles, we have just \"chosen\" to call them that, just to avoid irritating neologisms. This is rather different from the \"the wave theory collapsed\" stage of the account. But are we really dealing with something like \"wavicles\"? No, because these things actually don't behave \"somewhat like waves, and somewhat like particles\" -- they behave entirely like waves in some situations, and entirely like particles in others. And what is the difference? As Feynman understands quite well himself, we get particles with localizing detectors, waves without.\nGiven his preference for particles, what Feynman does is create a mathematical means of duplicating the effects of wave mechanics. His system is called \"summing over histories.\" The \"histories\" are all the possible tracks that a particle can take, like a photon reflecting off of a surface. The Classical rule is that light follows the shortest path, and that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Most possible paths violate both these rules. What Feynman does is that each possible path is represented by a vector. The length of the vector can be the square root of the probability of the particle going that way, but for reflections (in Chapter 2), Feynman makes the arrows of \"arbitrary standard length\" (p.41). What is important is the direction of the arrow, and that is determined by a little \"stopwatch,\" which runs, with the arrow rotating as the hand of the watch, as the particle travels. The direction of the arrow when the watch stops gives us what we need to work with. The vectors of a number of possible paths are then put end to end (\"summed\"). It turns out that vectors for lengthy and improbable paths point in many different directions and result in little net length when put end to end. When we look at the area representing the least distance and the least time, confirming to the classical rules, the vectors point in more or less the same direction; and when they are put end to end add up to a substantial vector, whose square is the overall probability of the particle taking that path. What we get is therefore more or less the Classical result.\nI do not mean that to be a comprehensive explanation, just enough to give us a picture here. Anyone wanting more detail should consult QED itself. The key element is the \"stopwatch,\" which gives us the direction of the vector, which makes it possible that the vectors are going to add up to something or cancel each other out. But this is a very unusual stopwatch. It does not measure time. Feynman says, \"the stopwatch hand turns around faster when it times a blue photon compared to a red photon\" [p.47]. What is it that is \"faster\" about blue light than red light? Not the velocity, not the rate of time itself (no Relativistic effect here), just the frequency. The rate of the \"stopwatch\" is determined by the frequency of the photon.\nBut particles do not have frequencies. Waves do. Feynman's stopwatch corresponds, not to time, like ordinary watches, but to the phase of a wave function. The summing of the vectors reproduces the interference effects of waves.\nThus Feynman is able to smuggle characteristics of waves into a theory that is supposed to be about particles. There seems little pretence here that the \"stopwatch\" represents anything the particle is actualy doing, as a particle. It is simply a mathematical device that gets us good results, and its very abstraction and dissociation obscures its correspondence to the natural characteristics and behavior of waves. Feynman, again, seems to rather enjoy the peculiarity of it. As he says elsewhere:\n...adding arrows for all the ways an event can happen -- there is no need for an uncertainty principle! [p.56]\nBut the uncertainty principle is not eliminated by the little arrows. Not only does it remain uncertain where particles are when they are behaving like waves, but it remains impossible that they should be any one place in particular to do what they do. Feynman's enthusiasm mistakes a mathematical abstraction for a substantive conclusion -- a precise and excellent example of the Sin of Galileo . But Feynman knows better than this. He knows that successful mathematics in a successful theory does not mean that we understand what is going on. But he gets carried away, and it is always a temptation to explain what is not understood as something that cannot and need not be understood. We see that in the following passage:\nI am not going to explain how the photons actually \"decide\" whether to bounce back to go through; that is not known. (Probably the question has no meaning.) [p.24]\nNot only does it have meaning but there is even an answer: \u00a0the photons both bounce back and go through, just as Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat is both dead and alive. They can do that as waves. They can't do that as particles (unless we use an indefinite number of particles, even in single particle experiments, as Feynman does). Which is the problem. What the photon must \"decide\" is where it is going to be when the wave function collapses. This is the crux of quantum indeterminacy, and Feynman simply doesn't want to deal with it.\nBut it is a problem larger than quantum mechanics. It is a problem of the metaphysics of possibility and probability, which no physicist or metaphysician (or physician) has done a very good job of dealing with. When we have just rolled three or four \"boxcars\" in a row (i.e. 12 on the dice), how do the dice then \"know\" that it is time to even out the statistical average by avoiding boxcars for a while in the future? Of course, the dice can't \"know\" because the earlier rolls of the dice have no physical effect on the later ones. But we have similar situations with sub-atomic particles. How do atoms of Uranium \"know\" that enough other atoms have decayed to account for the statistical half-life of the isotope, and that they need to wait, perhaps for millennia, to decay? Again, it looks like they can't \"know,\" but the individual events just happen to conform to the statistical average. The standard response of the mathematician to give up at that point (or say that it is a question that \"has no meaning\") is now troubled by the results of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Paradox, discussed above . Distant particles, whose properties have some indeterminate quantum correlation, \"know\" instantaneously what happens to the other particles, if this implies determinate states. This happens without \"hidden variables,\" i.e. without determinate but unknown properties of the particles. What it means is that the wave function is a physical connection and that its collapse is instantaneous, violating Special Relativity. If we apply this to dice throwing, it could mean that the dice do \"know,\" without any Classical physical connection, what has happened in the past.\nRichard Feynman, of course, has no intention, and really no interest, in getting into such territory. His statement that the question of how particles \"decide\" where to go probably \"has no meaning\" is an afterthought in which fragments of philosophical theory bob like flotsam in the flood. What it would get Feynman, as a theory, is that Nature is incomprehensible because it cannot be understood, i.e. there is no meaning for understanding to get. If true, this would certainly justify his phlegmatic disinterest -- \"theoretical physics has given up on that.\" But Feynman really expresses it more as a wishful thought, or as a decision, than as a real conclusion. It is a limit that he is willing to accept, because what interests him is the mathematical technique that is productive of the predictive results. That is the real stuff, and the philosophical questions, the metaphysics, are less important -- as, in physics, they actually are less important.\nFeynman's quantum mechanics in the end benefits from the abstraction that is possible in scientific theories. Not all questions need to be answered, understood, or even addressed to have a successful theory with dramatic results. It is therefore no disqualification to Feynman's greatness that he didn't resolve the basic philosophical problems of quantum mechanics. Certainly nobody else has. What is of interest is his theory as an example of one direction in which we can go with particles alone, avoiding wave mechanics, even though, in the end, characteristics of wave mechanics (the \"stopwatch\") must be attached, rather extraneously, to the particles. This is revealing -- namely that the physical waves in fact cannot be dispensed with, as Feynman himself occasionally seems aware, as when he says that his \"particles,\" hitherto the vindication of Newton, are actually \"somewhat\" like waves.\n"}, {"score": 2435.7664, "uuid": "21d442da-567d-59b3-b374-f4ce4ba21e7b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0507wb-99-11466", "target_hostname": "www.friesian.com", "target_uri": "http://www.friesian.com/space-2.htm", "page_rank": 1.407367e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Kantian <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>, Metaphysic of Space", "snippet": "If <em>what</em> Kantian consciousness requires <em>is</em> discrete actual things in space <em>and</em> time, this <em>is</em> exactly <em>what</em> <em>is</em> delivered in <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em>: Bohr stipulated that observers <em>and</em> their equipment would never be subject to <em>quantum</em> mechanical probability effects.", "explanation": null, "document": "Kantian Quantum Mechanics\nThe discomfort that I feel is associated with the fact that the observed perfect quantum correlations seem to demand something like the \"genetic\" hypothesis. For me, it is so reasonable to assume that the photons in those experiments carry with them programs, which have been correlated in advance, telling them how to behave. This is so rational that I think that when Einstein saw that, and the others refused to see it, he was the rational man. The other people, although history has justified them, were burying their heads in the sand. I feel that Einstein's intellectual superiority over Bohr, in this instance, was enormous; a vast gulf between the man who saw clearly what was needed, and the obscurantist. So for me, it is a pity that Einstein's idea doesn't work. The reasonable thing just doesn't work.\nJohn Stewart Bell (1928-1990), author of \" Bell's Theorem \" (or \"Bell's Inequality\"), quoted in Quantum Profiles, by Jeremy Bernstein [Princeton University Press, 1991, p. 84]\nNothing exists until it is measured.\nNiels Bohr\nThus many quantum-gravity theorists believe there is a deeper level of reality, where space does not exist...\nThese days, many of us working on quantum gravity believe that causality itself is fundamental -- and is thus meaningful even at a level where the notion of space has disappeared.\nLee Smolin, The Trouble with Physics, The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next [Houghton Mifflin Company, 2006, pp.240, 241].\nClassic quantum mechanics seems to exhibit some of the characteristics that Immanuel Kant described about the relation between phenomenal reality in space and time and things-in-themselves.\nAs interpreted by Roger Penrose , quantum mechanics, first of all, posits a certain metaphysical dualism. In the world as it exists apart from observation, matter and energy consist of waves\nthat are deterministically governed by Schr\u00f6dinger's Equation. The waves have an undoubted physical reality because of the interference effects that can be observed, and because the three dimensional size of atoms is due to the state of their electrons as three dimensional standing waves -- otherwise there is nothing to \"fill the space\" of atoms, except particles somehow being everywhere at once, which they can't be because in changing directions to get here and there they would radiate energy. (Fields can be said to fill the space, but this only postpones the problem, since fields in quantum mechanics are exchanges of virtual particles.) On the other hand, the square of the wave function gives a probability distribution for where discrete particles may be found once the wave function is collapsed by an act of observation. The wave function thus contains the sum of all possible states of a system until it is observed. This produces the paradox of Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat, who is both alive and dead at the same time, in just that proportion as each state is probable.\nThe act of observation, which collapses the wave function, is conformable to the Kantian act of synthesis, by which phenomenal objects are introduced into consciousness and subjected to the categories of the understanding. Niels Bohr's own Principle of Complementarity was that matter and energy could exhibit wave properties, or particle properties, but never both at the same time. If what Kantian consciousness requires is discrete actual things in space and time, this is exactly what is delivered in quantum mechanics: Bohr stipulated that observers and their equipment would never be subject to quantum mechanical probability effects. Around us, for Bohr, we maintain a little, discrete, actual, Classical universe.\nKant did not view things-in-themselves as containing the sum of all possibilities, and phenomena all actualities; but this duality is conformable to Kant's metaphysics as to none other. As a contribution to the metaphysics of possibility, the quantum mechanical wave function can easily be seen as complementary to Kant's idea of things-in-themselves, where various kinds of things can happen (like free will) that are not comprehensible in terms of phenomenal reality. Kant would just have to allow that characteristics of physical reality can intrude some depth into things-in-themselves, which he would not have considered -- though we can also handle this by positing an intermediate level of reality,\nbetween true unconditioned things-in-themselves and true discrete phenomenal objects. The wave function straddles the classic Kantian boundary, sharing some properties with phenomena, others with things-in-themselves.\nThus, where Kant would have considered all of phenomena governed by determinism, we now see the wave function as deterministic, while the collapse of waves into particles is random. Although chance in quantum mechanics has often been argued as allowing for free will , a free cause is still a very different thing from a random cause, which doesn't need mind or self or intention. Moral freedom is thus still left among things-in-themselves.\nKant's idea that space and time do not exist among things-in-themselves has been curiously affirmed by Relativity and quantum mechanics. In Relativity, time simply ceases to pass at the velocity of light: \u00a0for photons that have travelled to us as part of the Cosmic Background Radiation, time has stood still for most of the history of the universe. On the other hand, quantum mechanics now posits \"non-locality,\" i.e. physical distances, and so the limitation of the velocity of light in Relativity, don't seem to exist. This means that although time may apply to the wave function, space may not. The full empirical reality of space is only found among discrete particles and objects.\nThis curious result is the consequence of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Paradox, which was intended by Einstein as a reductio ad absurdum of quantum mechanics. If, for instance, a positron and an election are both created from an energetic photon, the conservation of angular momentum requires that one be spinning one way, and the other the other. But the complementary spins are equally probable for each particle. Thus, in quantum mechanical terms, the wave functions of each particle divide without a discrete state being determined. The particles might then separate to even cosmological distances, but as soon as the spin of one particle is observed, the other particle must have the opposite spin, which means that the wave function has collapsed across those cosmological distances and caused the other particle to assume a predictable spin. If this occurs instantaneously, it would violate the limitation of the velocity of light in Special Relativity.\nThis has now been shown to actually occur on the basis of Bell's Theorem (from John Bell, 1928-1990), meaning that Quantum Mechanics does violate Special Relativity by allowing instantaneous interactions across even cosmological distances. However, once observed, processes must still obey Special Relativity and the limitations of spatial distance, creating the kind of duality described by Kant. Bell himself found this result disturbing, but to Kant it would fit in with his own theory that space is only imposed by the representation of phenomenal objects.\nEinstein always objected to quantum mechanics because his metaphysical realism recoiled from the idea that observation would create a different kind of reality than what existed independently. At first Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle could be interpreted as meaning that the act of observation would physically disturb a system in an ordinary and realistic way, but then it soon became evident that strange things were allowed to happen in the wave function that not only could not be observed but could not even be conceived in ordinary and realistic ways. Reality existed in a different way while under observation than it did in itself.\nNow, the original philosophical theory which advocated something of the sort, that observation (the synthesis of objects in consciousness) imposes certain forms and rules before things can appear as phenomenal objects, was indeed that of Kant. Einstein and all his contemporaries must have been aware that there was something familiar about the emerging quantum world. The outright anti-realism of Bohr's Copenhagen Interpretation, although the focus of conflict, was only one historical possibility. Kant's empirical realism and transcendental idealism was another. But I have not noticed Kant receiving any kind of notice or credit for a theory that would address some of the paradoxes produced by quantum mechanics, denying the independence of physical reality from the presence of human consciousness. Since nothing is so characteristic of Kantian philosophy than that principle, perhaps it is only a matter of time before philosophers pull their heads out of the \"post-modernist\" hole in the ground and pay attention. Physicists, of course, don't have to care, unless they hear the call of metaphysics as well as physics.\nSince this page was originally posted, one of the most notable responses was from a correspondent who was indignant that the views of David Bohm (1917-1992) and other alternative theories about quantum mechanics were not presented. The purpose of this site, however, is to develop and apply Kantian and Friesian philosophy, and not necessarily to examine every other theory that other people may find important or definitive. Since Kant's was the original philosophical theory in which the observer imposes conditions on the nature of objects, it is arguably an interpretation with historical and conceptual priority. Thus, since it usually is not given much credit for this, it deserves some extra attention, as provided here.\nNow, however, some additional comment may be in order, after I was struck by the treatment of recent developments in quantum mechanics in a centennial article in the February 2001 Scientific American, \"100 Years of Quantum Mysteries,\" by Max Tegmark and the historic physicist (e.g. a teacher of Richard Feynman ) John Archibald Wheeler (pp.68-75 -- Wheeler died, aged 96, in 2008). According to Tegmark and Wheeler, the recent trend is to try and preserve the determinism of the wave function, substituting for discrete particles more localized waves whose interference or interaction has been aborted by \"decoherence,\" in which superpositions of wave functions are \"dissipated\" by \"tiny interactions with the surrounding environment.\"\nThis is the complete opposite of an approach like that of Bohm, who, like Einstein, believed that discrete particles with definite locations are always present. That would now be called a \"hidden variable\" theory, i.e. that the quantities for the location of the particles are there, but are hidden from observation. It is frequently said that the success of Bell's Theorem rules out all hidden variable theories, but Bohm's is an exception to this. The clarification seems to be that local hidden variable theories were ruled out; but Bohm's is a non-local theory. Bohm postulated a new force, the \"quantum potential,\" to account for the wave-like and interference effects between particles. The \"quantum potential\" itself takes the form of a wave, a \"guide wave\" or \"pilot wave,\" which directs the motion of the particles. Bohm thus combines wave and particle theory, preserving the realism of particles but accounting for wave effects with the action of the pilot wave. The quantum potential field and pilot waves, however, have unique properties. They act non-locally, so that the wave does transmit the EPR information instantaneously without losing any strength, and the wave is able to guide the motion of particles without any energy being involved. As a good quantum theory, the \"quantum potential\" field theory also might be expected to postulate the existence of particles that mediate the field, but this does not seem to be part of it -- and it would be awkward, because even virtual particles, which mediate forces in quantum mechanics, observe the limitations of Relativity. Later, Bohm assimilated the quantum potential into a larger theory of the \"implicate order,\" in which a hidden order, unity, and wholeness underlies all reality and accounts for all quantum effects, including the non-locality evident in the result of Bell's Theorem. Science writer Martin Gardner [cf. \"David Bohm,\" in Did Adam and Eve Have Navels? Debunking Pseudoscience, W.W. Norton & Company, 2000] describes this as asserting that the separating particles in the EPR case are actually the same particle in a higher dimension [p.77].\nNow, it is a respectable and venerable practice in physics to postulate new forces. For such theories to gain popularity, however, there is a great deal to overcome, not the least of which is just Ockham's Razor. If the main reason to have the \"quantum potential\" is just to preserve a realism and determinism about particles, then most physicists are not going to get too excited. The \"implicate order,\" on the other hand, is a large dose of metaphysics. Just as that may make the theory more attractive to theosophists, it is going to turn off mainstream physics, which is probably why Bohm's name is not even mentioned in Tegmark and Wheeler's article. The implication there is that the hidden variable theories are finished and that the hope for a deterministic quantum mechanics will be found in dealing with the wave function, eliminating discrete particles altogether.\nHowever, it is evident in the article's own terms that even \"decoherence\" doesn't help much with the basic quantum mechanical dilemmas about possibility. Thus, although it does not occur in the main text, the insert on page 73 contains the telling admission, \"Decoherence does not completely eliminate the need for an interpretation such as many-worlds or Copenhagen.\" Indeed. This is because even the \"dissipation\" of superpositions still leaves alternative \"classical\" probabilities. The alternative possibilities are either going to have to separate into different worlds, or they are going to have to collapse into just one particle. The insert on page 74 extends the decoherence of different worlds to the mental states of the observer, who can be both happy and sad about the fall of a playing card without the happy or the sad person being aware of the other. This does not seem to help much in eliminating the strangeness of quantum mechanics or the vast metaphysical overkill of the \"many worlds\" interpretation. If the wave function collapses into one particle, or one mental state, however, then this maintains the metaphysical dualism between wave function and particle that both Bohm and the decoherentists want to eliminate.\nCopyright (c) 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010 Kelley L. Ross, Ph.D. All Rights Reserved\nKantian Quantum Mechanics, Note\nA correspondent helpfully provided some references to recent treatments of Kant in relation to Quantum Mechanics, apparently as closely related to Bohr's antirealism -- references which mostly turned out to be listed at \" Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics .\" In should be remembered in this, however, that Kantianism means empirical realism, while, if the wave function is to be placed at a new level among things in themselves, that introduces another element of realism, i.e. the realistic wave function of de Broglie and Schr\u00f6dinger. Bohr, who says \"Nothing exists until it is measured,\" does not have a realistic interpretation of the wave function -- or, for that matter, of reality in general: \u00a0that is precisely what the \"Copenhagen Interpretation\" is. This is starkly different from what Kant's view would be of things in themselves. Bohr was not a Kantian. That Bohr, or even Einstein and G\u00f6del , knew his Kant does not mean that he (or Einstein and G\u00f6del) agreed with him. Indeed, even apart from Kant, Bohr's dictum is profoundly paradoxical, since, if nothing exists before we measure it, we would not be able to find anything to measure. This is like the Logical Positivists asserting that nothing has meaning unless it can be verified, even though we would need to understand that meaning before we could know whether it could be verified or not. (And since the Positivists supposedly accepted Hume's critique of Induction , they should have known that science cannot actually verify much of anything, leaving all of it meaningless -- no less than the conclusion of the Deconstructionists .)\nReturn to Text\nRichard Feynman's Quantum Mechanics\nNow I know that other old men have been very foolish in saying things like this, and, therefore, I would be very foolish to say this is nonsense. I am going to be very foolish, because I do feel strongly that this is nonsense! I can't help it, even though I know the danger in such a point of view. So perhaps I could entertain future historians by saying I think all this superstring stuff is crazy and is in the wrong direction....\nI don't like that they're not calculating anything. I don't like that they don't check their ideas. I don't like that for anything that disagrees with an experiment, they cook up an explanation -- a fix-up to say, \"Well, it still might be true.\" For example, the theory requires ten dimensions. Well, maybe there's a way of wrapping up six of the dimensions. Yes, that's possible mathematically, but why not seven? When they write their equation, the equation should decide how many of these things get wrapped up, not the desire to agree with experiment. In other words, there's no reason whatsoever in superstring theory that it isn't eight of the ten dimensions that get wrapped up and that the result is only two dimensions, which would be completely in disagreement with experience. So the fact that it might disagree with experience is very tenuous, it doesn't produce anything; it has to be excused most of the time. It doesn't look right.\nRichard Feynman, quoted in Not Even Wrong, The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law, by Peter Woit [Basic Books, 2006, p. 174-175]\nIn Richard Feynman's lectures on Quantum Electrodynamics (QED, The Strange Theory of Light and Matter, Princeton University Press, 1985) we get a certain picture of the behavior of sub-atomic particles and its analysis in quantum mechanics. While there may be other sources expressing Feynman's views, these lectures were delivered in 1983, just five years before his death, and so I take them as representative of his mature thought. While Feynman's theory is sometimes described as an alternative to other attempts to work out the metaphysics of quantum mechanics, I do not think that it is complete or consistent enough to qualify for that description -- though it is definitely a distinct mathematical approach. Nevertheless, it illustrates the approach of a great physicist, one who admittedly was very impatient with philosophical issues and who got a charge out of how odd it all was:\nI'm rather delighted that we must resort to such peculiar rules and strange reasoning in order to understand Nature, and I enjoy telling people about it. [p.78]\nOf course, Feynman admits that we don't \"understand Nature.\" On the page before the quote given he frankly says, \"...the way we have to describe Nature is generally incomprehensible to us\" [p.77]. And at the very beginning he warns the reader/auditor of his presentation, \"You're not going to be able to understand it\" [p.9]. We can easily say about this that we understand some things and don't understand others, which is the normal situation in science. With Feynman, however, we get the picture that the stuff we don't understand he has stopped trying to understand:\nI have pointed out these things because the more you see how strangely Nature behaves, the harder it is to make a model that explains how even the simplest phenomena actually work. So theoretical physics has given up on that. [p.82, boldface added]\nIs it normal in science for someone to say that a major branch of science, even the queen of the sciences, has \"given up on\" a major scientific question? When theory and research reach a dead end, certainly, nothing more can be done for the time being, which can certainly be the case with quantum mechanics; but Feynman seems unusually complacent about this. If you reach a dead end, there may be nothing more to do, but you are ready to leap back at it with the slightest hint of a new approach. As a \"curious character,\" Feynman is someone we would expect to be ever ready and eager for that hint.\nThe truth, I think, is that Feynman seems relatively complacent about this because it involves more of a philosophical issue, more of a metaphysical problem, than he is comfortable with or interested in. He likes what he does, and what he does is physics. You don't need the metaphysics to do the physics, and so Feynman does not feel much loss. And, being a bit of an iconoclast, he delights in the strangeness of it all. On the other hand, Feynman is not some kind of positivist or non-cognitivist. If we don't understand how Nature works, this is not because science is some kind of autistic, masturbatory exercise -- something that we just make up, something that is a mere human convention. If our theories about Nature are strange, it is because Nature is strange. Feynman was also pleased, to be sure, with quantum electrodynamics because of its predictive success (cf. the discussion of the observed and calculated magnetic moment of the electron, pp.6-7), which is what really distinguishes him from the \"theorists\" who don't believe that there is any real evidence for any scientific theory, except the forms of social control that impose theories on the mystified and oppressed (betraying the Marxist origin of this kind of stuff).\nWhat is the most striking in Feynman's version of quantum mechanics is his impatience with the wave-particle duality :\nFor many years after Newton, partial reflection by two surfaces was happily explained by a theory of waves, but when experiments were made with very weak light hitting photomultipliers, the wave theory collapsed: \u00a0as the light got dimmer and dimmer, the photomultipliers kept making full-sized clicks -- there were just fewer of them. Light behaved as particles. [pp.23-24, boldface added]\nThis is the key to Feynman's views: \u00a0he likes particles and is not interested in waves. This puts him more in the metaphysical camp of Einstein and the older realists and out of step with the developments detailed above which try and preserve the determinism of the wave function. He definitely doesn't like duality:\nYou had to know which experiment you were analyzing in order to tell if light was waves or particles. This state of confusion was called the \"wave-particle duality\" of light, and it was jokingly said by someone that light was waves on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; it was particles on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and on Sundays, we think about it! It is the purpose of these lectures to tell you how this puzzle was finally \"resolved.\" [p.23, note]\nThe puzzle, however, was not \"resolved,\" which may be why Feynman here carefully puts that word in \"scare\" quotes. We get a fuller statement here:\n...the wave theory cannot explain how the detector makes equally loud clicks as the light gets dimmer. Quantum electrodynamics \"resolves\" this wave-particle duality by saying that light is made of particles (as Newton originally thought), but the price of this great advancement of science is a retreat by physics to the position of being able to calculate only the probability that a photon will hit a detector, without offering a good model of how it actually happens. [p.37]\nIt is worse than that, since Feynman himself must say that the light goes everywhere at once, follows all possible paths, which is something a single finite particle can't do, regardless of the probability of where it may be found by a detector (cf. p.46, about diffraction gratings). So the wave-particle duality is not so easily \"resolved.\" Indeed, Feynman himself later describes rather well how the wave-particle duality works:\nNature has got it cooked up so we'll never be able to figure out how She does it: \u00a0if we put instruments in to find out which way the light goes, we can find out, all right, but the wonderful interference effects disappear. But if we don't have instruments that can tell which way the light goes, the interference effects come back! Very strange, indeed! [p.81]\nWith this, we don't need the \"Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\" rule. If we know where the particle is, then clearly it can't be everywhere, and the effects that depend on it being everywhere (interference, diffraction), disappear. If we don't know where the particle is, then all the effects explicable by wave mechanics appear. When the cat is away, the mice will play.\nBut Feynman also retreats occasionally from his flat \"light is made of particles\" assertion:\nIn fact, both objects [i.e. electrons and photons] behave somewhat like waves, and somewhat like particles. In order to save ourselves from inventing new words such as \"wavicles,\" we have chosen to call these objects \"particles.\" [p.85]\nSo now they aren't really particles, we have just \"chosen\" to call them that, just to avoid irritating neologisms. This is rather different from the \"the wave theory collapsed\" stage of the account. But are we really dealing with something like \"wavicles\"? No, because these things actually don't behave \"somewhat like waves, and somewhat like particles\" -- they behave entirely like waves in some situations, and entirely like particles in others. And what is the difference? As Feynman understands quite well himself, we get particles with localizing detectors, waves without.\nGiven his preference for particles, what Feynman does is create a mathematical means of duplicating the effects of wave mechanics. His system is called \"summing over histories.\" The \"histories\" are all the possible tracks that a particle can take, like a photon reflecting off of a surface. The Classical rule is that light follows the shortest path, and that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Most possible paths violate both these rules. What Feynman does is that each possible path is represented by a vector. The length of the vector can be the square root of the probability of the particle going that way, but for reflections (in Chapter 2), Feynman makes the arrows of \"arbitrary standard length\" (p.41). What is important is the direction of the arrow, and that is determined by a little \"stopwatch,\" which runs, with the arrow rotating as the hand of the watch, as the particle travels. The direction of the arrow when the watch stops gives us what we need to work with. The vectors of a number of possible paths are then put end to end (\"summed\"). It turns out that vectors for lengthy and improbable paths point in many different directions and result in little net length when put end to end. When we look at the area representing the least distance and the least time, confirming to the classical rules, the vectors point in more or less the same direction; and when they are put end to end add up to a substantial vector, whose square is the overall probability of the particle taking that path. What we get is therefore more or less the Classical result.\nI do not mean that to be a comprehensive explanation, just enough to give us a picture here. Anyone wanting more detail should consult QED itself. The key element is the \"stopwatch,\" which gives us the direction of the vector, which makes it possible that the vectors are going to add up to something or cancel each other out. But this is a very unusual stopwatch. It does not measure time. Feynman says, \"the stopwatch hand turns around faster when it times a blue photon compared to a red photon\" [p.47]. What is it that is \"faster\" about blue light than red light? Not the velocity, not the rate of time itself (no Relativistic effect here), just the frequency. The rate of the \"stopwatch\" is determined by the frequency of the photon.\nBut particles do not have frequencies. Waves do. Feynman's stopwatch corresponds, not to time, like ordinary watches, but to the phase of a wave function. The summing of the vectors reproduces the interference effects of waves.\nThus Feynman is able to smuggle characteristics of waves into a theory that is supposed to be about particles. There seems little pretence here that the \"stopwatch\" represents anything the particle is actualy doing, as a particle. It is simply a mathematical device that gets us good results, and its very abstraction and dissociation obscures its correspondence to the natural characteristics and behavior of waves. Feynman, again, seems to rather enjoy the peculiarity of it. As he says elsewhere:\n...adding arrows for all the ways an event can happen -- there is no need for an uncertainty principle! [p.56]\nBut the uncertainty principle is not eliminated by the little arrows. Not only does it remain uncertain where particles are when they are behaving like waves, but it remains impossible that they should be any one place in particular to do what they do. Feynman's enthusiasm mistakes a mathematical abstraction for a substantive conclusion -- a precise and excellent example of the Sin of Galileo . But Feynman knows better than this. He knows that successful mathematics in a successful theory does not mean that we understand what is going on. But he gets carried away, and it is always a temptation to explain what is not understood as something that cannot and need not be understood. We see that in the following passage:\nI am not going to explain how the photons actually \"decide\" whether to bounce back to go through; that is not known. (Probably the question has no meaning.) [p.24]\nNot only does it have meaning but there is even an answer: \u00a0the photons both bounce back and go through, just as Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat is both dead and alive. They can do that as waves. They can't do that as particles (unless we use an indefinite number of particles, even in single particle experiments, as Feynman does). Which is the problem. What the photon must \"decide\" is where it is going to be when the wave function collapses. This is the crux of quantum indeterminacy, and Feynman simply doesn't want to deal with it.\nBut it is a problem larger than quantum mechanics. It is a problem of the metaphysics of possibility and probability, which no physicist or metaphysician (or physician) has done a very good job of dealing with. When we have just rolled three or four \"boxcars\" in a row (i.e. 12 on the dice), how do the dice then \"know\" that it is time to even out the statistical average by avoiding boxcars for a while in the future? Of course, the dice can't \"know\" because the earlier rolls of the dice have no physical effect on the later ones. But we have similar situations with sub-atomic particles. How do atoms of Uranium \"know\" that enough other atoms have decayed to account for the statistical half-life of the isotope, and that they need to wait, perhaps for millennia, to decay? Again, it looks like they can't \"know,\" but the individual events just happen to conform to the statistical average. The standard response of the mathematician to give up at that point (or say that it is a question that \"has no meaning\") is now troubled by the results of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Paradox, discussed above . Distant particles, whose properties have some indeterminate quantum correlation, \"know\" instantaneously what happens to the other particles, if this implies determinate states. This happens without \"hidden variables,\" i.e. without determinate but unknown properties of the particles. What it means is that the wave function is a physical connection and that its collapse is instantaneous, violating Special Relativity. If we apply this to dice throwing, it could mean that the dice do \"know,\" without any Classical physical connection, what has happened in the past.\nRichard Feynman, of course, has no intention, and really no interest, in getting into such territory. His statement that the question of how particles \"decide\" where to go probably \"has no meaning\" is an afterthought in which fragments of philosophical theory bob like flotsam in the flood. What it would get Feynman, as a theory, is that Nature is incomprehensible because it cannot be understood, i.e. there is no meaning for understanding to get. If true, this would certainly justify his phlegmatic disinterest -- \"theoretical physics has given up on that.\" But Feynman really expresses it more as a wishful thought, or as a decision, than as a real conclusion. It is a limit that he is willing to accept, because what interests him is the mathematical technique that is productive of the predictive results. That is the real stuff, and the philosophical questions, the metaphysics, are less important -- as, in physics, they actually are less important.\nFeynman's quantum mechanics in the end benefits from the abstraction that is possible in scientific theories. Not all questions need to be answered, understood, or even addressed to have a successful theory with dramatic results. It is therefore no disqualification to Feynman's greatness that he didn't resolve the basic philosophical problems of quantum mechanics. Certainly nobody else has. What is of interest is his theory as an example of one direction in which we can go with particles alone, avoiding wave mechanics, even though, in the end, characteristics of wave mechanics (the \"stopwatch\") must be attached, rather extraneously, to the particles. This is revealing -- namely that the physical waves in fact cannot be dispensed with, as Feynman himself occasionally seems aware, as when he says that his \"particles,\" hitherto the vindication of Newton, are actually \"somewhat\" like waves.\n"}, {"score": 2435.0596, "uuid": "4c15f6fb-2081-528e-9450-1e1594a2c886", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1208wb-59-20891", "target_hostname": "brannenworks.com", "target_uri": "http://brannenworks.com/oldether.html", "page_rank": 1.2114063e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Ether, Relativity, Gauges <em>and</em> <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>", "snippet": "What&#x27;s also significant <em>is</em> that you can change <em>the</em> intervening momenta (that <em>is</em>, <em>the</em> momentum in <em>the</em> positions <em>between</em> x1 <em>and</em> x2), <em>and</em> provided you change it by an amount that integrates out to 2\u03c0, there <em>is</em> no way to detect <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> at <em>the</em> end points.", "explanation": null, "document": "Ether, Relativity, Gauges and Quantum Mechanics\nCarl Brannen, August 22, 2003 -\nAbstract\nA modern version of ether is shown to be compatible with special relativity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics.

Ether and Einstein\nThe concept of a \"luminiferous ether\", (that there must be a firmament that carries the vibrations of light, and there must therefore also be a preferred frame of reference) has been largely ignored in physics since Einstein so beautifully explained the Michaelson-Morley light speed measurements in his 1905 paper on Special Relativity. So in a paper that postulates the existence of an ether, I should begin with a critique of the reasoning that first suggested that ether not exist.\nEinstein's reasoning was based on two postulates:\n(1a) The laws of nature are the same in all inertial frames of reference.\n(1b) The speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.\nBased on these principles, Einstein shows that Galilean relativity is inadequate. This we all agree with. But even the assumption of postulate (1b), as a perfect fact of nature, does not in itself disprove the absence of a luminiferous ether. Instead, it shows is that if there is a preferred inertial frame of reference attached to the ether, an experiment in that frame will measure the speed of light as c. Throughout this paper I will assume \"inertial\" when talking of frames, unless otherwise noted, and by \"preferred\", I mean the rest frame which is connected to the ether and so is unique subject to an arbitrary rotation (but not to a boost).\nEinstein's special relativity paper shows that time is relative. More precisely, what he shows is that the measurement of the passage of time is dependent on the movement of the clock that measures it. This is less than showing that there is no absolute time. What it shows is that there is a relation between movement and the perceived passage of time. If there is a preferred frame of reference, then the passage of time in that frame would be a logical choice for absolute time, at least in the \"Special\" theory. All other frames would experience the same absolute time, but a slower perception of time.\nModern text books teaching the theory of Special Relativity give a series of arguments showing why ether was not acceptable, but these arguments do not apply to all varieties of ether, as will be shown later. They typically cover (a) Galilean ether, (b) a version where matter drags frames around, and (c) a version where light travels at different speeds depending on the velocity of the source. But not all models for ether are subject to the same deficiencies as these three. In the next section of this paper, I will present a version of ether that is compatible with both special and general relativity.\nThe logical argument for the existence of ether was the belief that waves require a medium in order to be transmitted. That is, there must be something that is affected, in order to have a wave. This is a common observation of our physical world, and it was natural to extend it to the subject of light. But the simple versions of ether that the 19th century physicists tested were inadequate.\nA world of Galilean ether would be a tough world to live in. This is a fact that was probably not appreciated in the 19th century. But if the speed of light depended on the absolute velocity of the frame it was measured in, our modern technological apparatus would be subject to small effects that would have complicated periodicity due to the motion of the earth. What's worse, life itself, with its strong dependency on finely tuned molecular interactions, would be very difficult to produce in a world with Galilean ether. And an ether where the velocity of waves depends on the velocity of their source is a difficult and complicated theory, as is one where the ether is dragged around by matter.\n19th century physicists should have known that the Galilean ether was impossible. Some crystal forms, for example, should have shown growth dependencies on the time of day, or the time of year, that they were crystalized. As the magnitude of the ether wind changed with the millenia, there should have been differences in the crystal habitats of the minerals that were laid down. They had no such observational evidence of ether, but still they expected that the ether was out there.\nThe absence of evidence for ether, combined with the extensive search for it, suggests that the logic behind the existence of the ether was stronger than the modern physics mind realizes. It was only with great difficulty that physics was weaned off of ether, and the separation was effected only by the repeated failures of its predictions. Alone among modern physics theories, the ether was supported without any experimental evidence at all, but instead on the basis of its compelling logic alone. Consequently, a version of ether that supports relativity needs to be seriously considered. Such an ether would presumably have received strong support 100 years ago, and if it is compatible with experimental observations between then and now, it should be as seriously considered now.\nIt is at least logically consistent to arbitrarily add ether, with an implied preferred frame of reference, to Special Relativity (or General Relativity, as will be shown in a section 2), as Einstein did not prove that no such frame existed. What he showed instead, was that given his postulates, there was no apparent need for such a reference frame. Adding an additional postulate, to the effect that a preferred frame of reference exists, gives a slight change to the interpretation of some of Einstein's results, but no changes to the mathematics or its predictions. One change is that the preferred frame of reference provides a consistent time ordering of spacelike separated events. Another is that the Lorentz rotations are interpreted not as mixing space and time, but instead as indicating the subjective rate of passage of time (i.e. proper time) in a moving reference frame. This means that boosts will no longer mix space and time, but instead will simply alter the relationship between absolute time, and the measurements of clocks.\nSo this paper is written with an additional postulate to Einstein's, one that implies the existence of a preferred frame of reference, but rather than make that postulate alone, I will instead postulate the reasoning behind the original belief that ether should exist:\n(2) There is only one true description of nature.\nThis is not to be interpreted in the sense of coordinate transformations, or in terms of translational and rotational invariances, but instead in the sense of geometrical content. For example, a description that uses polar coordinates is as true as one that uses Cartesian coordinates. But an explanation of electricity and magnetism that uses a potential that results in the same predictions when the potential has a constant added to it, cannot be true description of nature. The postulate implies that if nature has a potential, then that potential has a value. Our inability to define that potential is an indication that our understanding of the potential is incomplete, not that we live in more than one physical reality.\nAs an example of the use of the above postulate, consider the success of gauge field theories. The vector potential for E&M in quantum mechanics is not defined in terms of particular values, but instead a wide range of possible potentials are equivalent. The various potentials are connected by \"gauge transformations\", which redefine the vector potential in geometrically non trivial ways. According to the above postulate, only one of these gauges can be \"true\". The others must therefore either be accidents of our choice of coordinates, or possibly be created by a force that imitates the symmetry.\nNote that our inability to guess the true gauge does not prevent us from making deductions based on the assumption of its existence. Indeed, we choose any gauge that appeals to us, quantize the others that we didn't choose (and are therefore assumed to be forces mediated by the exchange of particles), and when we make calculations for things we can observe, the results will turn out to not depend on our choice of gauge. Under the above postulate, the success of this program does not prove that there is no true choice of gauge, but instead shows that nature is so good at imitating the gauge symmetry that we cannot distinguish between situations of nature connected by that symmetry, and so cannot (at least at the present time) know when we have chosen the true gauge, and therefore don't need to know what it is. But it was the existence of a true gauge that allowed us to deduce the forces that we quantized.\nOne might ask, \"if nature is so good at hiding her details from us, why should we care?\" The first answer to note that no amount of experimental evidence can prove that a symmetry truly is exact. We are very finite creatures, so we should be aware of what to look for that would indicate that a symmetry of nature that we assumed was perfect, was, in fact, only approximate. The second answer is to note that at the present time, the assumption that the observed (and therefore at least approximately accurate) symmetries of nature are perfectly accurate has led us to an understanding of quantum mechanics and relativity that is not only difficult to reconcile with each other, but is impossible to reconcile with our own experience as physical creatures. This has resulted in bizarre notions as to what the nature of the universe is.\nArguably the worst example of nature showing two apparently equally true faces, at least apparently, is in the concept of \"duality\" in quantum mechanics. It's said that quantum objects (which I will call particles from here on) are both particles and waves. But the particle form occurs only after the wave form is \"collapsed\", so these two forms cannot coexist at the same time. Instead, the wave form is what describes an experiment before it is run, while the particle form describes the result of the experiment after it is complete.\nThis division of labor between the particle and wave descriptions of matter and energy suggests that time must pass, from the future to the past, for a wave to be collapsed to a particle. But the equations of physics do not describe this collapse in detail. Instead, quantum mechanics associates the wave function amplitude with a probability of a given particle position (or other measurement). Without a true global time, quantum mechanics shows violations of causality. Bringing back the ether solves this problem, though it does leave locality broken, if not in the passage of information, then in some sort of influence. More will be discussed on this later, along with Bohmian mechanics, an alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nThe fact that it is the passage of time that collapses wave functions, along with the obvious observation that the passage of space has no effect on wave functions, suggests that the mixing of space and time by relativity is not nature's truth, but is instead a result of an ether with a symmetry that imitates the mixing of space and time by altering clock rates.\n2. An Ether Compatible with Relativity\nIn any given rest frame, all light travels at the same speed. This is compatible with our usual understanding of waves, in that when we want to model waves, and to make them as simple as possible, this is exactly what we assume; that the speed of a wave does not depend on its wavelength. The 19th century physicists, following Maxwell, noticed this simplicity in light's behavior, and assumed that light was simply another one of the many physical waves following such a law, and so began the search for Galilean ether.\nBut it is not in the motion of light that the world is complicated. Instead the complexity is in the motion of the clocks that measure distances and the speed of light, and in the relationships between relative rest frame velocity and measurements of distances and times. Thus it is not light itself that is complicated, but instead the motion of the massive bodies that are used to measure light. In any one given rest frame, and in particular in the preferred rest frame of the ether, light is very simple.\nSo if we assume a preferred rest frame, the motion of light in it is natural and exactly as expected. Instead it is the motion of massive objects that must be bizarre and unexpected. Where the searchers for the ether ensured their failure was in searching only for the \"luminiferous\" ether, rather than a more general ether whose waves define the motion of both energy and matter.\nMinkowski space itself makes a poor choice for the ether because it intrinsically mixes space and time. That is, time is not treated as a special coordinate distinct from the spatial dimensions, but instead, at least locally, is indistinguishable from them. But the metric that defines Minkowski space is very important to the observed motion of matter, so it's a good place to start in a search for an ether compatible to relativity:\n(3) ds2 = dt2 \u0096 (dx2 + dy2 + dz2).\nIf time is going to be held distinct from space, we need to bring dt to one side of the equation:\n(4) dt2 = ds2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2\nThe above metric defines how much absolute time has passed given that the object has changed its position by dx, dy, and dz, and has experienced a passage of its own proper time by ds. An ether that exhibits this metric will naturally exhibit the relationships between proper time and absolute time that special relativity predicts (and therefore also Lorentz contractions, see Appendix A), but there is the small problem of how to interpret ds as a dimension of the ether.\nEinstein's equations mix space and time, the above metric mixes space and proper time. This seems to make no sense, as different objects have different proper time. But make the s dimension cyclic, with radius R, and if R is small enough, we will get an ether that appears to large ungainly creatures such as ourselves as the standard R3 that we all perceive.\nIn several ways, this is a simplification of the metric defined by Einstein. Instead of a Minkowski space, this is locally a simple Euclidian R4 space, and is globally a standard differentiable manifold, R3xS1. And since ds is defined for the movement of all objects, no extraneous degrees of freedom have been introduced.\nAnother simplification is that in this topology, all objects, massive or massless, travel at the speed of light. The old ether, the one that was rejected by experiments 100 years ago, would have had difficulty supporting the movement of matter waves, given that matter travels at various speeds. But this ether greatly simplifies that problem by instead assuming an ether where all objects (i.e. matter waves) travel at the same speed. The additional dimension is an extra degree of freedom, but the restriction of speeds to that of light removes one degree of freedom, and leaves the equations of motion unchanged from classical special relativity.\nTo convert an event in this topology over to an event as defined in special relativity, simply ignore the s component. The remaining four components (one being the absolute time), provide the four vector for the event (in the reference frame of the supposed ether). But converting an event the other way is subject to a slight problem, what to choose as the s component.\nIn working practical problems in classical special relativity, it will be found sufficient to define the arbitrary s component as zero. This may not be an obviously successful tactic, and since the reader may also have difficulty appreciating the fact that this topology gives the same results as special relativity, I've included sample calculations for time dilation and Lorentz contraction in Appendix A, showing them to be identical between the two topologies.\nThe arbitrariness of the s component should not be surprising given that the uncertainty principle shows that defining the position of an object to perfect accuracy will result in its momentum being completely uncertain.\nThat matter, or at least electrons, always travel at the speed of light is not a concept first introduced by this paper. The idea was a feature of the zitterbewegung theory of Schroedinger in 1930. A good modern paper along this line is \"The Zitterbewegung Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics\" by David Hestenes, Found. Physics, Vol. 20, No. 10, (1990) 1213-1232. The zitterbewegung idea is that stationary electrons move at the speed of light in circles just large enough to provide the spin angular momentum of the electron. The difference between the Zitterbewegung concept and this topology is that the Zitterbewegung helices are assumed to be in the usual 3 space dimensions.\nThe generalization of this topology to General Relativity follows the example of Special Relativity. We need to get the metric into a form where all the curvature is in the space coordinates:\n(5) ds2 = dt2 - gijdxidxj.\nThe above metric gives coordinates that are called a \"synchronous coordinate system\" or a \"Gaussian normal coordinate system\". How to set up such a coordinate system for an arbitrary spacetime manifold is shown in exercise 27.2 in the classic text \"Gravitation\" by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler (1971), page 717. The existence of such a coordinate system is similar to the choice of gauge in gauge field theories.\nWhen one performs the above program on the standard Schwarzchild metric the resulting geodesics all eventually terminate by falling into the black hole's event horizon. The natural ether interpretation is that gravitation is caused by matter's general tendency to destroy ether. A black hole is then a region where ether is being destroyed faster than the speed of light would allow light waves to escape the destruction. We sometimes see a similar effect in rivers; when the current is faster than the wave velocity, waves cannot propagate upstream. Note that the frame dragging effects of rotating black holes show that matter's interaction with ether is not a simple scalar destruction.\nSince it is clear that matter has a distorting effect on the ether, one wonders whether it would also modify the radius of the hidden dimension. If presence of matter increased the dimension this would give an attractive force that would be felt by massive objects but presumably ignored by massless ones. A decrease in the dimension would cause a repulsive effect. But neither this, nor the details of the frame dragging from the previous paragraph will be further discussed in this paper, which instead assumes a flat ether, except in section 6 where the MOND effect is calculated.\nMotion in the hidden dimension s implies the experience of proper time. Therefore this topology will be called the \"proper time topology\".\n3. Klein Gordon and Dirac Equations\nIn some ways, the Klein Gordon equation seems to be the only wave equation in particle physics, in that the components of the Dirac and the Maxwell equations also satisfy the Klein Gordon equation. Where the Maxwell and Dirac equations differ from the Klein Gordon equation is in the number of field components, and in how those components interact. Maxwell's equations have already been derived as a consequence of a hidden dimension. This is known as the Kaluza-Klein derivation, and need not be repeated here.\nThe assumption of this topology is that all particles travel at light speed, and have zero mass, therefore the natural wave equation to postulate is the massless Klein Gordon equation, with, of course, the extra space dimension s:\n(6) \u22022/\u2202t2 \u03a8 = c2[ \u22022/\u2202x2 + \u22022/\u2202y2 + \u22022/\u2202z2 + \u22022/\u2202s2 + V(x,y,z,s) ] \u03a8(x,y,z,s,t).\nTaking a Fourier decomposition of \u03a8 in the s dimension, and keeping only the lowest order terms cos(s/R) and sin(s/R), turns the \u22022/\u2202s2 term into a mass term, if m = 1/R, giving the standard Klein Gordon equation in the usual 3 dimensions:\n(7) \u22022/\u2202t2 \u03a8 = c2[ \u22022/\u2202x2 + \u22022/\u2202y2 + \u22022/\u2202z2 + V(x,y,z,s) - m2 ] \u03a8(x,y,z,s,t).\nThe usual matrix form of the Dirac equation is sufficiently complicated that playing with it was my evening entertainment for several years. The articles by David Hestenes are easily the most illuminating on the subject, but unfortunately these papers require an understanding of \"Geometric Algebra\". An \"algebra\" is collection of \"numbers\" or \"points\" that can be manipulated with certain rules and operations. A good introduction to Geometric Algebra, and how to use it to derive Schroedinger's and Pauli's equations from the Dirac equation is Spacetime Physics with Geometric Algebra , David Hestenes, Am. J. Phys, 71 (6), June 2003, especially section VII. The algebraic rules have the flavor of exterior calculus, with the notation a little less revealing, and therefore more confusing, but most importantly it is much more inclusive.\nI'm sure that most of the readers of this article have failed to click on and read the above link, and that's too bad, but perhaps I will give a few more reasons to go back and click on it, and to at least read it through once. The \"spacetime splits\" that Hestenes talks about are equivalent to my assumptions of specific ethers, though these splits are limited to flat Minkowski space, a limitation that I expect the author to soon repair. I should note that Hestenes is not tainted with any connection to me or the theory of this paper, though I have found his work particularly illuminating.\nIn my own words, what Hestenes shows, in the above paper and in a few others, is that Schroedinger's and Pauli's wave equations are derived directly from the Dirac equation, and that Schroedinger's equation is that of a particle in an eigenstate of spin, unperturbed by any spin interactions. The \u03b3\u03bc matrices in Dirac's equation are reinterpreted as defining a set of orthonormal coordinate axes in Minkowski space.\nThe reinterpretation shows that a spinor should be thought of as one half of a proper Lorentz rotation. That is, it is usual to imagine a Lorentz rotation as a 4x4 matrix, but this wastes a lot of coordinate information because of redundant information. His algebra breaks a Dirac wave function into the product of the square root of a probability density, a phase factor, and a \"rotor\". A rotor is an object that defines a Lorentz rotation. The phase factor is the traditional cause of interference in quantum mechanics, and is not explained in Hestenes papers. In section 5, I will return to this subject.\nIn equation (192) of the above reference, Hestenes writes the Dirac equation in \"coordinate free\" form. The equation explicitly assumes a time like vector \u03b30, and a bivector i = \u03b32\u03b31, where \u03b31 and \u03b32 are perpendicular to \u03b30, but it does not use any coordinates as defined by these vectors. I guess this is \"coordinate free\", but it does require the assumption of selected coordinate axes, and therefore is quite compatible with an ether requirement. He shows that the equation is Lorentz invariant, in that the results do not depend on the choice of coordinate axes. The situation is reminiscent of gauge field theories, in that geometrically distinct conditions result in the same physical observations, but despite this symmetry, a choice of gauge must be made. Note that the equations of general relativity, on the other hand, in addition to being coordinate free, are also axis free. This suggests that other than splitting off the time coordinate, we should not try to gauge general relativity as it could be a true description of nature. This assumption will be made for the remainder of this paper.\nNote that to use a rotor to perform a Lorentz rotation on an object requires that the rotor be used twice. This explains why the probability density shows up as the square of the quantum wave function better than any other explanation I've seen. Now go, read the above link at least once, and don't come back until you're done. You'll thank Hestenes (and maybe me too) for it.\nYou may have noted that section VIII of the above Hestenes paper includes a short introduction to Bohmian mechanics. This paper takes a slightly different interpretation than Bohmian mechanics, in that the wave and particle parts of the complete description of a quantum object are here assumed to be true only at different \"real\" times. That is, if the experiment is to be run at 3:00PM, then at 2:45PM a \"true\" description of the particle's prospective tracks is given by the wave function, while at 3:15PM, a \"true\" description of that same 3:00PM event, will now be given by the actual particle track. Thus the two conflicting descriptions of the same event are both true, but only at different moments in time. It's not that nature is dual, instead that with the passage of time, the true nature of the event changes from a prospective wave to a retrospective particle.\nBecause of this interpretation of time, this paper disagrees with Bohmian mechanics over the question of \"wave function collapse\". Instead, this paper agrees with the Copenhagen interpretation, where a wave function collapses to the result of a measurement. But instead of looking for a mysterious \"measurer\", I look for the simple passage of time. And the time that must progress is proper time. This was the original motivation for exploring the proper time topology, an effort that is documented on the web in this link: Searching for a fundamental reality in physics\nThis paper's concept of the passage of proper time and wave function collapse indicates that our universe truly cannot be described in the way that classical mechanics implicitly assumes. Classical mechanics uses the fact that there is a situation, and that situation changes with time. But even with the assumption of an ether, and therefore a global time coordinate, the observed facts of quantum mechanics prevents the universe from reasonably being described by a situation that evolves from moment to moment. As an example, consider the astronomical case of galactic lensing. A distant galaxy acts as a magnifying lens, showing an even more distant galaxy. In this situation, one can set up an experiment where a photon is arranged to interfere with itself despite the passage of billions of years of space, and billions of years of time. That the photon has not been collapsed, and so is capable of interfering with itself over such a magnificently huge two-slit experiment, is an indication that the wave function collapse is tied to the passage of proper time, not that of the global time. If, for example, another photon had been simultaneously emitted in an entangled state, it would not be possible for a polarity measurement of the first photon to complete before billions of years of global time had gone by.\nExperiments showing that uncollapsed quantum waves can be arranged at significant distances in space and time are, under the assumptions of this paper, assumed to result from the particles having been accelerated to such high speeds that they experience little of the passage of proper time. Mother nature's demonstrations of the same effect, but with light, are more impressive.\nWith the picture of wave functions as the true description of future experiments, and particle tracks as the true description of past experiments, one must consider the action of the passage of proper time that changes one to the other. Physics does not deal with this action much. There is quite a lot of literature on the \"Quantum Zeno Effect\". An example of this effect would be a radioactive particle that emits a gamma ray with some half life. Half lives imply that the probability of the particle decaying must follow an exponential curve. But quantum mechanics shows that the particle, just after being \"observed\", has a smaller probability of decaying. The mathematics follows from the fact that wave functions are square roots of probability densities, and therefore always show up squared. The probability of a very early decay ends up squared, and therefore smaller than an exponential decay would indicate. By the way, I figure that the mathematics behind the MOND effect is similar, as will be discussed in section 6.\nThis action of the passage of time, along with the assumption that true descriptions of nature exist, suggests that there must be a topological relation between a description of a quantum object before and after the passage of time. This assumption can be made even in the absence of an equation relating the two descriptions. Since there are many different ways of describing a particle or a wave, the requirement that they be topologically related reduces the number of descriptions that we need to consider. Also note that with this interpretation of quantum mechanics, the action of wave function collapse is, in some ways, analogous to the reverse of the action of quantization. This allows these two seemingly unconnected processes to be justified with respect to each other. But quantization, and also \"second\" quantization, deserve another paper because this one is already more than long enough.\nIt's pretty clear that we can describe a particle position with a scalar field, providing we allow a delta function in the field. But Hestenes' description of the Dirac equation indicates that a Lorentz rotation vector should also be included. For this reason, it's more natural to describe the particle track by a Lorentz vector field, where most of the vectors are zero. The above link \"Searching for a Fundamental Reality\", includes an intuitive justification for the choice of a velocity vector field based on a classical analysis of Schroedinger's equation, but there is no question that Hestenes' more general and elegant analysis is to be preferred. (Now are you finally going to go back and read that paper?)\nBut there is one part of Hestenes' analysis that is lacking, and that is a derivation of the quantum interference effects. Having only learned the rudiments of the geometric algebra a few days ago, I will refrain from deriving the results in the Dirac equation, and instead return to the derivation of interference effects in Schroedinger's equation in section 5. But first, the next section covers some interesting and useful self interference effects in the proper time topology.\n4. Interference Properties\nIn the interest of fulfilling the principle of simplicity, as well as in recognition of the fact that all types of matter and energy require only a single Plank's constant, I will make the assumption that there is only one fundamental subparticle that makes up all of matter and energy. This is not so radical as it looks. All of both matter and radiation uses the same Plank's constant. And the zitterbewegung model of the electron requires that they travel in tightly helices. Maybe those helices are tightly bound states. That is the assumption of the rest of this paper, but this is more for the convenience of not having to keep track of the variety.\nIf the electron has substructure, our intuition would suggest that the constituent particles should be lighter than the electron, and therefore observable in the lab, an observation that has not been seen. But our intuition is honed on bound states where the binding energy is very small. Even in those states the combined masses of the constituents of a bound state is greater than the mass of the bound state itself, as Einstein's relation between mass and energy shows. This loss of mass is undetectable at chemical energy levels, but can be detected at nuclear energy levels. At the level of nuclear subparticles, such as the quark, the missing mass eliminated by the bound state is so large that quarks are permanently bound.\nRenormalization causes the rest mass of particles that have very strong charges to be very high. Since the posited subparticle is to be massless, this means that it must be characterized with a frequency which is very high. In this scheme, there is only one very strong fundamental force in nature. That force binds subparticles with an extremely high fundamental force. The Strong, electroweak, and perhaps the gravitational force are then the remanants of that fundamental force, after most of its field is cancelled in bound states. After renormalization, this makes the more deeply bound states appear to be lighter.\nEven if we do not know how the fundamental subparticles form bound states that define standard particles, we can make some deductions based on interference effects in the proper time topology. These effects are due to the requirement that the wave states for the subparticles must be single valued around the s dimension.\nSo let W(x, y, z, s, t) be a plane wave travelling at speed c, and representing this postulated fundamental subparticle. To model a massless particle travelling in an arbitrary 4-dimensional direction, define a wave vector k and frequency \u03c9 with |k| = k, and \u03c9 = k c:\n(8) k = (kx, ky, kz, ks),\n(9) \u03a8(x, y, z, s, t) = exp(i (k \u2022 r - \u03c9 t) ).\nNote that in this theory, \u03c9 is a fundamental constant of nature. That is, if the particle is to experience 4 dimensions of travel, its movement in the s dimension must be similar to its movement in the usual 3 dimensions. Thus its frequency \u03c9 cannot depend on its speed in the usual 3 dimensions. And since this is the fundamental particle, its frequency is fundamental.\nTo be single valued the wave must match itself in the s dimension. This is similar to the requirements for bound solutions to a central force problem, but in this case we have the unfamiliar consequence that the spectrum of free space solutions is not continuous. Instead, the spectrum is discrete, with the wave vector's s wave number defined by an integer number:\n(10) \u03a8(x, y, z, s, t) = \u03a8(x, y, z, s + 2 \u03c0 R, t)\n=> ks = n / R.\nThis implies that the time dilation ratio is quantized:\n(11) Rtd = ks / k = n c / R\u03c9.\nAnd that the speed in real space is also quantized:\n(12) vn = c \u221a (1 - (nc / R \u03c9)2).\nThe number of different possible speeds is no longer infinite as in special relativity, but instead is finite:\n(13) Ns = [\u03c9 L / (2 c \u03c0)].\nIn order for this theory to be realistic, Ns must be very large, so in the remainder of this article, it is so assumed. Since there are only a finite number of different speeds, there must be a maximum speed, and this maximum is attainable:\n(14) Vmax = c \u221a(1 - (c/R\u03c9)2) ~= c - c(c/R\u03c9)2.\nThere is also a minimum attainable speed, which may be zero, or may be larger, depending on the exact values of \u03c9, c, and R. But the minimum attainable speed will be bounded above by:\n(15) vmin < c \u221a( 2c/R\u03c9).\nThe above equation (15) gives the quantization of speeds for speeds near zero. That is, low speeds are quantized approximately according to:\n(16) vslow = n \u221a( 2c3/R\u03c9) + vmin.\nSince the topology has only a finite number of possible momenta, there is no need to pick an arbitrary momentum cutoff, or to cancel infinities due to ultraviolet catastrophes. Also, the zero point vacuum energy is finite, another property that a fundamental theory of nature should satisfy. The source of the divergence in standard physics are integrals over all possible momenta, these become finite sums in the proper time topology:\n(17) (2\u03c0)-3 \u222b \u222b \u222b F(p) d3p\n=> (2\u03c0)-2 \u222b \u222b \u2211 F(p) sin(\u03b8p) d\u03b8p d\u03c6p\nSince the s dimension is so small, and the Lorentz symmetry so good, none of the above effects is going to be easy to measure. So other than justifying doubtful regularization procedures, we haven't done anything useful here. But the quantization of velocities does suggest a justification for the fact that quantum mechanics involves probabilities. Perhaps chance enters into the process when a particle finds itself induced by forces (or the distortion of space) to travel at velocities that are incompatible with its momentum or energy. It must then choose another velocity that is legal, and it does so randomly, or perhaps by exchanging a very small energy particle of some sort.\nUnder this assumption, the fact that particles stay in stationary states despite the induced randomness is due to the fact that particle interference (in the wave form) extends across time. By \"across time\", I mean that according to the Feynmann prescription, the interference is calculated by summing the entire path of the quantum object. If it were instead the case that the inteference only applied at the point where the quantum object existed as a particle, and so was choosing which random path to follow, then the path could be described with a classical description where the system state changes with global time.\n5. Interference Effects and Quantum Mechanics\nThe previous section covered self interference effects in waves due to the cyclic nature of the proper time topology. Because the fundamental frequency \u03c9 is so high, the self interference effects are extremely difficult to directly detect. But interference effects between two waves, or between a single wave and itself (as in the 2-slit experiment), will result in much lower \"beat\" frequencies, and these effects are easily within the reach of physics today. This section explores these interference effects and shows that they are equivalent to quantum mechanical interference effects.\nClassically, one of the oddest features of quantum theory, is the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle states that two fermions may not occupy the same state. This is a generalization, by fourier transform, of the more basic concept that two identical fermions cannot occupy the same position at the same time. As stated, this is a very general constraint on nature. A less restrictive principle, but with the same end effect, is to require that fermion waves interfere with each other in such a way as to cause the joint probability of their being found at the same point to be zero. In this form, the Pauli exclusion principle can therefore be derived from the interference effects between two Dirac waves with the same spinor state. Since Hestenes, in the above cited paper, has shown that Schroedinger's equation describes this limiting case of the Dirac equation, I will choose Schroedinger's waves to analyze the interference effects of quantum mechanics. In some future paper, after I've studied the Geometric Algebra for a few more weeks, I'll try to update this calculation to use the full Dirac theory.\nSchroedinger's wave equation is a fundamentally complex equation, and according to Messiah [ Quantum Mechanics , first English edition (note: the link is to a later edition which I do not have) (John Wiley ~1961), pages 222-224, Volume I], the natural way to show the correspondence between this equation and classical mechanics is to write \u03a8 = A exp(i S/\nh\n). This is similar to what Hestenes does in his decomposition of the Dirac equation, but, due to familiarity, I will follow Messiah's notation. This is in the beginning of the section entitled \"Classical Limit of the Schroedinger's Equation\". Making this substitution, seperating into real and imaginary parts, and multiplying by 2A gives two equations, one for \u2202S/\u2202t [refer equation (VI.17) in Messiah], the other for \u2202A/\u2202t [refer (VI.19)]:\n(18a) \u2202S/\u2202t + grad2 (S) /(2 m) + V = (\nh\n2 / 2m) (\u0394 A) / A,\n(18b) m \u2202(A2)/\u2202t + div(A2 grad S) = 0.\nEquation (18b) is simply the continuity equation for the probablity density A2. It can be interpreted in a purely classical manner. Messiah interprets S to be a potential that generates a velocity field v for that probability density (where J is the usual probability current density) [refer (VI.21)]:\n(19) v = J/A2 = grad(S) / m.\nMessiah then shows that (with\nh\n= 0) the velocity field follows the law of motion for a classical fluid under the influence of the given potential. But if he had not taken the classical limit, the conclusion that S was a potential for a velocity field would have still been valid, as there is no\nh\nin the probability continuity equation (18b). This is compatible with the assumption, from the requirement that there be continuous topological connection between a particle track and its wave function, that the wave function should therefore be defined in terms of a velocity vector field. This is clearly the non relativistic version of Hestenes' factorization of the Dirac wave function into a product of parts, one of which is a Lorentz rotation.\nSince the probability density acts like a classical fluid, as opposed to a gas, it need have only a single velocity defined at each point. This is not what a statistical ensemble of (non interacting) particles with various positions and velocities would give. Such a collection would be a gas, rather than a fluid. Instead, the \"particles\" strongly interact, and they interact in such a way as to allow only a single velocity at each point in space. This is compatible with the requirement that the wave function truly be a wave, rather than an ensemble of possible trajectories. It is also a hint as to the nature of quantization.\nS only shows up with a gradient, except for the term indicating how it changes with time. It is therefore possible to take the gradient of that equation (18a), and then make a change of variables to replace grad S with m v:\n(20) m \u2202v/\u2202t + grad(v2 / 2m) + grad V = (\nh\n2 / 2m) grad(\u0394 (A) / A).\nAs an aside, the above equation suggests a generalization of Schroedinger's wave equation that may be useful in writing out an explicit wave function collapse equation. After both the wave equation and the particle track are described by velocity fields, there is still a very fundamental difference between them, and that is the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. The uncertainty relation does not hold for the particle track. It's a natural inclination to try and put a wave function into Schroedinger's wave equation that does not satisfy Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, just to see what Schroedinger's equation indicates that its evolution is, but one quickly discovers that this is impossible. Any wave function always must satisfy the uncertainty relation. But equation (20), is no longer bound by this restriction. While equation (20) does evolve solutions of Schroedinger's wave equation the same as Schroedinger's equation does, it also evolves velocity fields that do not satisfy Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. This suggests that (20) may be a starting point for an equation that, relates the collapsed wave functions to the uncollapsed wave functions.\nIntereference effects in quantum mechanics show up in the joint wave functions, which are joint probability densities. To analyze the quantum effects, as opposed to classical effects, it's necessary to define joint probability densities for both cases, and to compare the two interferences. It's frequently stated that classical mechanics does not allow for identical particles, but this observation does not apply to a wave theory. Even in classical mechanics, waves is waves, and they cannot be distinguished. But different particles can be distinguished, and quantum mechanics gives the joint probability density of distinguishable particles the same as classical mechanics does.\nThe quantum mechanical fundamental description for a single particle consists of its wave function, whose informational content includes a probability density and a velocity potential. The corresponding description for two particles is a joint probability density, and a joint velocity potential. The joint probability density is a function on R3 x R3, as it has to provide a density value for the two particles. The two position coordinates will be called x1 and x2. To be specific, let P(x1, x2) d3x1 d3x2 be the probability that the the first particle is found within d3x1 of position x1, and the second particle within d3x2 of position x2.\nI've already made the more sensitive wince, by refering to \"first\" and \"second\" particles just inches from having previously assumed that they are identical. Because of this defacto enumeration of the particles, most of our calculated probability density values will be 1/2 (for n particles, 1/n! ) the literal value, (but they'll be correct when x1 = x2). The reason physicists use this way of counting is that it makes the wave functions easier to normalize and calculate with. That is, if our space only had two points, a and b, we will have P(a,a) + P(a,b) + P(b,a) + P(b,b) = 1.\nWe'll compare the four cases using notation common to the quantum case. So let P1(x) and P2(x) be the probability densities (i.e. P = A2), and S1(x) and S2(x) be the velocity potentials for the corresponding quantum particles. Classical particles are described likewise, except that there is no velocity potential.\nIf the particles are distinguishable, the combined probability density is just the product of the densities. This is true for both classical mechanics and quantum mechanics:\n(21) Pdist(x1, x2) = P1(x1) P2(x2)\nIf the particles are identical, but are classical, we have pretty much the same thing, but since the particles are identical, we have to take this fact into account. Note that the factor of 2 is from our splitting the density for x1 \u2260 x2 into to two parts; the factor which may have caused some wincing:\n(22) Pclass(x1, x2) = (P1(x1) P2(x2) + P1(x2) P2(x1)) / 2.\nThe formulas for identical fermions and bosons are more complicated as they also depend on A. In these equations, the \u00b1 indicates bosons (+) or fermions (-):\n(23) Pquant(x1, x2) = (P1(x1) P2(x2) + P1(x2) P2(x1)) / 2\n\u00b1 [P1(x1) P1(x2) P2(x1) P2(x2) ]1/2 cos [ ( S1(x1) - S1(x2) ) - ( S2(x1) - S2(x2) ) ].\nNote that S1 or S2 could have a constant added to it with no change in the result. This is a global symmetry of S. But there is also a local symmetry in that local changes to S by multiples of 2\u03c0 result in no change in the joint probability density. These observations also apply to the joint velocity potential, Squant(x1, x2). Also note that if P1 and P2 share no support, then the quantum mechanical formula is identical to the classical formula.\nThe fact that the joint wave function does not depend, even locally, on changes in S by 2\u03c0 suggests that S should not be considered to be a real function. Instead, it's natural range should be S1, a hint at a hidden dimension.\nSince we are assuming that the fundamental nature of a quantum field should be a velocity field, we need to convert equation (23) into a form that depends on v instead of S. This requires integrating v to get S, which can be done along arbitrary paths. Parameterizing the path integrals by \u03b7 gives:\n(24) Pquant(x1, x2) = (P1(x1) P2(x2) + P1(x2) P2(x1)) / 2\n\u00b1 [P1(x1) P1(x2) P2(x1) P2(x2) ]1/2 cos [ \u222b12m (v1 - v2)/\nh\n\u2022 d\u03b7 ].\nWhen one calculates the interference between two real waves, one expects to get a result that is a product of real waves. For example:\n(25) cos( A ) + cos( B ) = 2 cos((A + B)/2) cos((A - B)/2).\nThe above equation has the usual interference term that we expect. There are two sinusoidal waves in the product. The first one, cos((A + B)/2), is an average of the interfering waves, while the second one, cos((A - B)/2), is a difference. In equation (24), by contrast, only the difference term arises, the other does not. And the two cosines on the left hand side of equation (25) do not appear at all in the uninterfered probability densities. This suggests, along the line of the zitterbewegung theory, that the missing terms are due to their having such high frequencies that they are not detectable at our own energy levels. If Schroedinger's wave equation averages out these high frequencies, only the low difference frequency appears.\nWhat's really odd about this interference is that it is completely cyclic in\nh\n. That is, if you are considering points that are at a distance \u0394x, an addition to the momentum mv1 of\nh\n/\u0394x results in the same inteference. What's also significant is that you can change the intervening momenta (that is, the momentum in the positions between x1 and x2), and provided you change it by an amount that integrates out to 2\u03c0, there is no way to detect the difference at the end points.\nOf course it's an accepted fact that angular momentum is quantized. But the cosine factor in equation (24) suggests that there is a milder form of a sort of quantization for momentum itself. That is, that momentum integrated over a distance interferes with itself according to multiples of\nh\n. If it were not for the proper time topology, this would be a rather bizarre feature to have to explain.\nAccordingly, let W1 and W2 be two waves in the Proper Time topology, and let's compute their interference patterns. As before, assume that the two waves use the same \u03c9, but have different wave vectors, so let their corresponding wave vectors be k1 and k2. Assuming equal magnitudes for the waves represented as cosines then the interference is:\n(26) W1(k1 \u2022 x \u0096 \u03c9 t) + W2(k2 \u2022 x \u0096 \u03c9 t)\n~= cos(k1 \u2022 x \u0096 \u03c9 t) + cos(k2 \u2022 x \u0096 \u03c9 t)\n= cos((k1+k2)/2 \u2022 x - \u03c9t) cos((k1-k2)/2 \u2022 x).\nThe (k1+k2)/2 term is of the same form as the original W waves, and approximately of the same length (and therefore momentum), while the (k1-k2)/2 term is a lower frequency interference term. Since the wave functions correspond to particles with velocity c, we can convert k1 and k2 to velocity format using the relation v = c k/k = c2k/\u03c9. The resulting interference, given in terms of velocity, is:\n(27) cos((v1 - v2) \u03c9/2c2 \u2022 x).\nThe above term gives the inteference between two plane waves. For more general waves, the above is integrated along a suitable path, and the general interference term is therefore:\n(28) cos(\u222b12 (v1 - v2) \u03c9/2c2 \u2022 d\u03b7).\nComparing term (28) to equation (24) shows that interference between real waves in Proper Time topology will be equivalent (at least in the sinusoidal parts) to interference between complex waves in Schroedinger's equation providing:\n(29) \u03c9/2c2 = m/\nh\n.\nMy guess is that when this calculation is redone with the Dirac equation and geometric algebra, the equivalence will trivially extend to the amplitude portions of (24) and (28) as well, but that calculation will await my further exploration of the geometric algebra. Consistent with the Proper Time topology, the above equation corresponds to the frequency of a particle travelling at speed c, but there is now an extra factor of two. This factor comes from the conversion between quantum and classical interference. Quantum interference is defined as a straight subtraction, but classical interference takes the difference and divides by two.\nAt the present time, the frequencies implied by the above equation are too high to be observed. But beat frequencies are much lower, so it is in the interference interactions that the Proper Time topology shows itself as quantum mechanical interference.\n5. Experimental Support and MOND\nAn argument can be made that the quantization of velocity (16), along with a characteristic particle frequency \u03c9 imply that very small accelerations will be modified under the proper time topology. The idea is that velocities are quantized by a constraint that a (non relativistic) fundamental particle will encounter at a rate of approximately \u03c9. If the acceleration is so small that its influence over a time 1/\u03c9 will be less than the minimum quantum of velocity, then the effect on the particle's motion is unclear. One would expect that the effect of random perturbations to the particle velocity would cancel out, and the particle would receive an average acceleration corresponding to the classical prediction. But anyone who has dropped a quarter in a pin ball machine knows that a particle, when it encounters a constraint that restricts its motion, will travel so as to minimize its potential energy rather than kinetic. Were this not so, a pin ball game would last considerably longer.\nThe same principle suggests that a particle in a very weak potential, when faced with a quantized velocity, will choose the velocity that corresponds to a dive into the potential rather than the velocity that corresponds to a jump out of the potential. This could result in a substantial increase in the effective strength of very weak potentials.\nJust such an effect has been observed in the galactic rotation measurements. Larger galaxies have their motions analyzed in a newtonian approximation. The calculated accelerations are exceedingly small, the observed accelerations are also low, but much higher than predicted by calculating the potential due to the matter visible in the galaxy.\nMost physicists assume that the higher observed accelerations are due to a form of missing \"dark\" matter, as only matter which radiates, and therefore is visible, is easily toted up by earth-bound astronomers when computing the gravity well of a galaxy. But an alternative explanation for the effect has been published by Mordehai Milgrom, under the name \"MOND\" or Modified Newtonian Dynamics. The original paper is Mordehai Milgrom \u0093A modification of the Newtonian dyanamics as a possible alternative to the hidden mass hypothesis\u0094, Astrophysics. J. 270:365-370 (1983), a more recent article is titled MOND - A Pedagogical Review - M. Milgrom and a search of the internet for the terms \"MOND\" and \"Milgrom\" will provide plenty of hits. MOND assumes a characteristic acceleration that modifies weak gravitational fields so as to make them stronger. The characteristic acceleration in MOND is about 1x10-10m/sec2.\nThis paper makes the assumption that gravitation is a strictly geometric effect, rather than a force mediated by the exchange of particles such as gravitons. Under this assumption, gravity is not a force, but is a direct geometric consequence of the ether. Even quantizing in a flat proper time topology is difficult, but a curved topology, even as a perturbation, is very difficult and confusing. Rather than attempting such a program, it is much easier to assume a solution of the equations in the curved coordinates, and then to see what kind of potential is required to cancel the effect of the curved solution. This ensures that the problem is calculated in true coordinates, but without our actually having to solve the problem. Instead, we look for the amount of potential required to cause an acceleration that would cancel the apparent acceleration caused by the combination of curved coordinates and ether flow.\nSince the coordinates are assumed attached to the ether, the unperturbed Hamiltonian will correspond to a particle subject to the ether. Not only is the ether curved, but in terms of the way we usually look at the world, the ether is \"moving\". For example, if the earth were stationary in an infinite empty ether sea (so we ignore the sun, stars etc.) then from our vantage point on the earth's surface ether would be constantly streaming down into the earth. This corresponds to the fact that when we throw small objects up, they come back down. If we want to make a calculation in ether stable coordinates, (or, more accurately, in assumed ether stable coordinates as in other varieties of gauge theories) we cannot use the constantly accelerating coordinates that are so natural for us surface bound creatures. Instead we must make a gauge choice that is at least theoretically compatible with a possible ether.\nWe know how fast the ether is \"moving\", that is, moving with respect to the accelerating coordinates that we prefer to use for galaxies, newspaper delivery routes, and the like. Einstein's equations give this rate, it is simply the gravitational acceleration of local frames of reference. As is usual with gauge effects, the approximate Lorentz symmetry eliminates our need to know the velocity of the ether, and the effect of the ether will turn out to be independent of the ether motion. The following calculation appears to be independent of an assumption of the ether, but this is not quite true, because the unperturbed Hamiltonian is implicitly assumed to be true to the ether. The absence of an explicit need to gauge the ether is due to my explicitly cancelling the ether out of the calculation by the way that the perturbation is set up.\nIn order to simplify the calculation, it also helps to ensure that only two of the velocity quantized wave functions need to be used. That is, the particle will be forced to travel at only one of two possible speeds. To do this, we have to make sure that the total velocity change is small, and the easiest way to do this is with a perturbation that only lasts a short time. In addition, I will only deal with one dimension as is suitable for very flat, but still flowing, ether. A generalization for the missing dimensions is obvious.\nI will follow the notation of Morrison, Estle, and Lane's Quantum States of Atoms, Molecules, and Solids , Prentice-Hall, 1976, pages 124-140, as this is the book I keep around (26 years) for perturbation calculations, but any undergraduate book on quantum mechanics should cover time dependent perturbation theory. So let H(0) be the unperturbed Hamiltonian, and let the perturbation be a short pulse of length \u03c4 with an acceleration \u03bb in the positive x direction as follows:\n(30) H(1)(x, t)\n= { -m\u03bbx; if 0 < t < \u03c4,\n= { 0 if \u03c4 < t.\nClassically, the above acceleration will increase the velocity (as compared to the unperturbed Hamiltonian), by \u03bb\u03c4. In order to use perturbation theory on this problem, I need to have not only that \u03bb be small, but also that \u03c4 be sufficiently small that the classical change in velocity is less than the quantization of velocity as imlied by equation (16). That is, I require:\n(31) \u03bb \u03c4 << \u221a(2 c3/R\u03c9).\nAssume that before the perturbation, the particle is in an eigenstate |\u03a8k(x, t)> of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, with its momentum in the positive x direction. After the perturbation, the particle will be in a mixture of the |\u03a8k> and |\u03a8k+1> states. The resulting state will not be an eigenstate, but we can compute the average momentum and see what effect the perturbation had. Write the state at time t in terms of a superposition of these states as follows:\n(32) \u03a8(x, t) = \u03b1k(t) \u03a8k(x, t) + \u03b1k+1(t) \u03a8k+1(x, t)\nIf Newtonian mechanics applies, the change in momentum is m \u03bb, so the mixture will satisfy:\n(33) < p(\u03c4) >Newton = pk + m \u03bb \u03c4.\nPerturbation theory gives the following approximations for the coefficients for the two momentum eigenstates that we are considering:\n(34a) \u03b1k(\u03c4) =~ 1 - i \u222b0\u03c4 < \u03a8k(x) | H(1) | \u03a8k(x) > dt /\nh\n(34b) \u03b1k+1(\u03c4) =~ - i \u222b0\u03c4 exp(-i(\u03c9k - \u03c9k+1)t) < \u03a8k+1(x) | H(1) | \u03a8k(x) > dt /\nh\n.\nFor sufficiently small \u03c4 the exponential in (34b) will become unity. This allows the time integrals to be performed giving, after substituing in equation (30):\n(35a) \u03b1k(\u03c4) =~ 1 + i < \u03a8k(x) | m \u03bb \u03c4 x | \u03a8k(x) > /\nh\n= 1 + i m \u03bb \u03c4 < x > /\nh\n(35b) \u03b1k+1(\u03c4) =~ i m \u03bb \u03c4 < \u03a8k+1(x) | x | \u03a8k(x) > /\nh\n.\nBy a change of coordinates, we can zero the (unperturbed) average position in (35a). This shows that to first order, as expected, only the coefficient (35b) is non zero. But (35b) can be used to compute the change to (35a) so as to make that coefficent compatible when computing the average momentum of the perturbed state. The squared magnitudes of the two coefficents must add up to one. Consequently, the average momentum in the final perturbed state is:\n(36) < p(\u03c4) > = (1 - |\u03b1k+1(\u03c4)|2)pk + |\u03b1k+1(\u03c4)|2pk+1\n= pk + |\u03b1k+1(\u03c4)|2 (pk+1 - pk).\nIt's not immediately obvious how to compute the factor < \u03a8k+1(x) | x | \u03a8k(x) > , but it is clear that for non relativistic particles this will approximately be a constant, and that it will be proportional to R. Accordingly, substituting \u03baR for this factor, equation (36) gives the momentum at time \u03c4 as:\n(37) < p(\u03c4) > = pk + m2 \u03bb2 \u03c42 \u03ba2 R2 (pk+1 - pk) /\nh\n2.\nComparing equation (37) with equation (33), it's clear that there is something odd going on here. Equation (33) is linear in \u03bb, but equation (37) is bilinear. It appears that the quantum state takes a little while to accelerate, but keeps on accelerating. Of course this perturbation eventually fails, so the acceleration does not continue gaining strength.\nEventually the particle will be accelerated up to the next quantum velocity and the squared acceleration will cease. If we had a good solution to the equations, we could then compute the change in velocity, divide it by the time required to get to that next quantum velocity, and we would have the average acceleration. It would be nice if that result would match the classical equation. But in the light of the difficulty of solving these equations, we can model the effect by assuming that that the \u03b1 coefficients will vary in time in a sinusoidal manner. That is, assume:\n(38a) |\u03b1(\u03c4)| = cos(t/T),\nand select T to match the perturbation solution (37). In this case, we get T =\nh\n; / (m \u03bb \u03ba R ) so the approximate solution for the momentum as a function of time is:\n(39) < p(t) > = cos2(t m \u03bb \u03ba R /\nh\n; ) pk + sin2(t m \u03bb \u03ba R /\nh\n; ) pk+1.\nAccording to our approximation, the time required to get to pk+1 is T \u03c0/2, so therefore the acceleration, averaged over the step in velocity, is the ratio, which can be simplified with equation (16) and (29) to get:\n(40) < a >quantum = (pk+1 - pk) / (m T \u03c0/2) = m \u03bb \u221a( \u03ba2 R \u03c9 / 2 c).\nOne hopes that the various approximations and the constant \u03ba cancel inside the square root. Assuming this, equation (40) shows that the quantum acceleration averages out to the classical acceleration.\nThis would be the end of the story, except that this equation is for particles with s motion, and who therefore suffer the passage of time. According to the theory of this paper, these particles must eventually suffer wave function collapse. If the potential is so flat that wave function collapse occurs much faster than the particle can make it to the next velocity quantization, then the particle will be artificially kept in the previous velocity state, as will be shown next.\nTo put this into the Copenhagen interpretation, if the particle momentum is \"measured\" frequently enough, the transitions between velocity eigenstates will be suppressed. This will have the effect of decreasing the acceleration felt by the particle. Since this calculation is being made in the limit of very flat potentials, this effect cannot be avoided, unless one assumes that particles never get their wave functions collapsed.\nIt is my belief that wave function collapse is a continuous function of time. But I don't have an equation for it, so to model the effect of wave function collapse, I will instead assume a periodic Copenhagen type collapse, where the wave function is reduced with a probability according to the square of the wave function.\nAccordingly, returning to equation (37), and assuming wave function collapses occur every \u03c40 seconds, we get that the average acceleration over this period is, again using (16) and (29):\n(41) < a >collapse = m2 \u03bb2 \u03c40 \u03ba2 R2 (pk+1 - pk) / (\nh\n= \u03bb2 \u221a( \u03c402 \u03ba4 \u03c93 R3 / 8 c5)\n= \u03bb2 / a\u03c40,\nwhere a\u03c40 has the units of acceleration. It gives a characteristic rate of acceleration where quantum effects of wave function collapse become noticeable in the proper time topology. This effect is independent of the proper time topology in that any system with quantized velocities, and with periodic wave function collapse, will exhibit the same behavior.\nTo connect this calculation to MOND, consider the case of a spaceship which is attempting to maintain a \"stationary\" (i.e. not orbiting) position far away from a massive galaxy. To do this, it must apply a force in opposition to gravity, that is, it must accelerate away from the center of the galaxy. If it fails to do so, it will slowly be dragged down into the gravity pit. How much force is required to maintain themselves against gravity?\nUse ether coordinates. Since these coordinates are (slowly) being sucked up by the galaxy, the spaceship will have to constantly accelerate itself against these coordinates. In order to remain where they are, they will have to produce a constant acceleration. Suppose that they hook up a very weak engine and produce the force m \u03bb, where m is their spaceship mass. According to the above calculation, if \u03bb is sufficiently small, the effect of wave function collapse will reduce the actual acceleration that they receive from their thrust. Not knowing of this effect, they will perceive their problem as an unexpectedly strong gravitational field. When they get their engine running fast enough to keep themselves stationary, they will record their apparent acceleration, \u03bb, as the local gradient in the gravitational field. This value will be different from the number predicted by Newton according to:\n(42) \u03bb = \u221a(a\u03c40 aNewton).\nThe above is the MOND equation for small gravitational accelerations.\nBut the implications of equation (42) run deeper than just the slowly accelerated rocket. Because the laws of physics are highly Lorentz invariant, the same supplemented gravitational acceleration (or more precisely, reduced acceleration against a very weak gravitational field) will be felt by all other observers, even those travelling at the speed of light. If we could correctly quantize the proper time topology, with wave function collapse, in a slightly curved space, the resulting particle tracks would act as if the gravitational force were increased according to (42). The topology itself tells me nothing about the calculation, but the result of the calculation is not in doubt. The effective gravitational force will have to be supplemented, otherwise the behavior of the thought experiment spaceship will appear to local observers, who fall with the ether, to be even more anomalous than the MOND effect itself. That is, such a free falling local observer would note a violation in conservation of momentum.\nThis effect where a repeated measurement of a system causes unexpected changes to the dynamics is also present in the \"Quantum Zeno Effect\". In both that case and this, it is important that there be a discrete set of eigenvalues. With the MOND calculation, the eigenvalues are for velocity, while in the QZE calculations, the eigenvalues are for energy. A good simple introduction to the QZE that will illustrate the similarities to the above calculation is in this thesis paper:\n\"This is a result of the measurement feedback onto the system, and this effect must be taken into account in any experiment seeking to perform frequent observations of any sort of weak signal.\" Quantum measurement theory and the quantum Zeno effect , Michael J Gagen, 2nd March 1985\n7. Afterword\nThe calculation of the previous section reminds me of a thought experiment that many smart people who have been well trained in relativity nevertheless get wrong: If a man standing on the earth's surface has two watches, and throws one vertically up into the air and then catches it, which of the two watches will have been slowed by time dilation? Most people will say the thrown watch is slowed, as it is the one that \"had its velocity changed and went on a journey, just like the travelling twin\", but in fact the held watch is the slow one. This can be verified by integrating out the Schwarzchild metric, which you might do if you are a graduate student studying for your preliminary exams, but that the held watch is the one that is accelerated, while the thrown watch is the one that travels along a geodesic, is easily verified by comparing the situation to the equivalent one where the man with the watches is travelling inside a space ship that is accelerating at one g. In this case, without the confusing presence of the earth's apparently immobile surface, the thrown watch is easily seen to be travelling on a geodesic, and therefore suffering a maximum experience of time between the two events \"throw the watch\", and \"catch the watch\".\nSince the above thought experiment is one of my favorites, it's somewhat surprising that I had such difficulty realizing that the perturbation calculation above is an equivalent situation. I made the calculation months ago but assumed that there was a mistake as the indication seemed to be that small accelerations are squared in quantum mechanics, and therefore small gravitational accelerations should be similarly reduced in strength. Since the MOND effect is an increase in strength, I concluded that this was a bug in the calculation. I hope you enjoyed reading this almost as much as I enjoyed writing it.\nCarl Brannen\nSeptember 16, 2003\n[A] Appendix A: Special Relativity computations in the Proper Time topology\nFor those who have difficulty seeing how it is that the Proper Time topology, which explicitly possesses a preferred frame of reference, could be equivalent to special relativity, which makes the assumption that no such frame exists, this appendix provides detailed calculations for time dilation and length contraction both in special relativity and in Proper Time topology.\n[A.1] Time dilation\nProblem: A spaceship travels 3 light years away form earth, at a speed of 0.3 c, and then returns at the same speed. What is the proper time experienced on the Earth during the voyage, and what is the proper time experienced on the spaceship?\nSpecial Relativity Solution: The voyage requires 3/0.6 = 5 years each way for a total of 10 years. This is the proper time experienced on the Earth. The spaceship experiences a time dilation of \u221a(1 \u0096 0.62) = 0.8, so the proper time experienced on the spaceship is 10 x 0.8 = 8 years.\nProper Time Solution: The spaceship starts at the point (x, y, z, s) = (0, 0, 0, 0). Align the x axis with the direction of travel. The velocity of the spaceship on the outgoing voyage is therefore given by the vector (0.6, 0, 0, 0.8). The 0.8 value is required to make the speed of the spaceship work out in total be 1. The spaceship\u0092s position as a function of the global time t is therefore:\n(0, 0, 0, 0) + (0.6, 0, 0, 0.8) t1\nSetting this equal to (3, 0, 0, s1) gives t1, the global coordinate time for the arrival of the spaceship at its destination, and t1 is therefore 5 years. Note that the value of s1 is unspecified, as the total length of the hidden dimension is negligible as compared to the many light years of travel. Since the proper time component of the velocity of the spaceship is 0.8, the total elapsed proper time on the outgoing voyage of the spaceship is therefore 0.8 x 5 = 4 years. Similarly, the return trip uses a velocity of (-0.6, 0, 0, 0.8) and results in a coordinate time passage of 5 years and a proper time for the spaceship of another 4 years. The result is, of course, identical to the Special Relativity result.\n[A.2] Lorentz Contraction\nA rod flies lengthwise through a laboratory with a speed of 12/13 c. The lab measures the length of the rod as 6 meters. How long is the rod measured in a coordinate system moving with the rod?\nSpecial Relativity Solution: The Lorentz contraction factor is 1/\u221a(1 \u0096 (12/13)2) = 13/5, so the proper length of the rod is 6m x 13/5 = 15.6 meters.\nSince the Proper Time topology does have a preferred coordinate system, the question is not as clear as it is in special relativity. But in any given coordinate system, the constancy of the speed of light provides a technique for measuring length. Accordingly, the rod can be measured in its own frame of reference by calculating the time required for light to travel the length of the rod. Since proper time is a property of individual particles, rather than dimensional objects such as rods, the length of the rod will have to be measured by computing the time required for the light to travel down the rod, be reflected at the end, and then travel back to the point of origin on the rod. The proper time experienced by the end point of the rod during this flight will indicate (when multiplied by c = 1) twice the length of the rod.\nSo let the rod begin at position (0, 0, 0, 0) through (6m, 0, 0, 0), and set the velocity vector for the rod to be (12/13, 0, 0, 5/13) so that it moves in the +x direction. The light signal starts at (0, 0, 0, 0) and proceeds with a velocity vector of (1, 0, 0, 0) until it meets with the other end of the bar at time t1. The light direction is then reversed, and it travels with velocity (-1, 0, 0, 0) until it meets up with the trailing end of the bar at time t2. The length of the bar, in the reference frame of the bar, is then 1/2 the proper time experienced by the trailing end of the bar from 0 to t2. The equations for t1 and t2 are therefore:\n(0, 0, 0, 0) + (1, 0, 0, 0) t1 == (6, 0, 0, 0) + (12/13, 0, 0, 5/13) t1,\n(1, 0, 0, 0) t1 + (-1, 0, 0, 0)( t2 - t1) == (0, 0, 0, 0) + (12/13, 0, 0, 5/13) t2.\nSince our real world does not distinguish between the hidden \u0093proper time\u0094 coordinate, the equalities need only be established for the first three coordinates.\nThe solution is t1 = 13 x 6 meters, and t2 = 2028/25 meters. The proper time experienced on the trailing edge of the rod is, by time dilation, 5/13 of t2, which gives 156/5. Half of this is the proper length of the bar, which is the same as the value given by special relativity. Therefore, both theories show the Lorentz contraction of the bar to be the same.\n"}, {"score": 2434.691, "uuid": "295fcd47-a523-50f9-8e67-d6d161119a10", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1609wb-31-21062", "target_hostname": "hans.wyrdweb.eu", "target_uri": "http://hans.wyrdweb.eu/tag/quantum-mechanics/", "page_rank": 1.3219873e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "<em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em> \u00ab CONSTABLE RESEARCH B.V.", "snippet": "Pauli was a brilliant scientist, highly involved in <em>the</em> creation of <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>.

Life for our ancient forefathers was a mixture of wonder and fear.\nThe interesting point to notice is that the human body has not changed since the old days. The things that have changed are our environment and our language.\nWe see objects our ancestors could not see and therefore we talk about concepts our ancestors were not aware of.\nAlthough our concepts have changed the way we think has not changed.\nThinking is a bodily process. Our muscles talk and our brain processes a huge amount of data.\nCurrent science is able to look into the living body to observe the process of thinking. Scientists think that thinking has a lot to do with seeing . A picture paints a thousand words when the objects (nouns) and the relations (verbs) between the objects are named.\nOur ancient ancestors saw other ancestors, animals, rivers, mountains, trees, plants, stars, the sun and the moon. Nature was all around them and Nature was the source of their reasoning.\nWhen you look at nature for a long time you come aware of all kinds of patterns. The Sun rises and disappears every day. The Moon shows itself in the same stages. The plants and the animals act according to these patterns. Observing Nature during day and night generates a theory of Nature and because Nature is cyclic the ancient theory of nature was a cyclic theory.\nOur ancestors observed short and long term cycles with their eyes and created a theory of everything just like the current scientists are trying to do.\nThe human has not changed and his ability to define and verify a theory has not changed also.\nIn our time we have developed highly advanced instruments to probe in the big and the small structures of Nature. We are able to look at the beginning of the Universe and we are able to look at the very small structures of Matter.\nJust like our ancient ancestors we use the data of our new eyes, the instruments, to formulate a theory. The big question is if our theory looks a lot different from the theory of our ancestors.\nThe images our eyes detect are interpreted by the rest of our body. Sometimes we look with our Imagination (Daydreaming, Fantasy). Sometimes we look with our Emotions. We love or dislike what we see.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes we look with our Expectation and see what we want to see\u00a0 (Verification) or don\u2019t want to see (Falsification). The objective instruments of science project our subjective theory, our belief-system,\u00a0upon our reality.\nMany people would say that we have advanced in our knowledge of our reality. They believe history is a progressive process. It always moves up because we are learning all the time.\nOur ancestors would say that history is a cyclic process. It moves Up and Down. Civilizations rise and disappear. History repeats itself all the time.\nThe proof of their theory is visible everywhere we go but we ignore the evidence. We, the Western people, believe our civilization will stay for ever because our supreme technology is able to solve every problem we will encounter.\nThe ancient people used different symbols, concepts and names to describe what they observed. We, the Western people, don\u2019t spend much time to understand their theory because our theory of history proves that it is a waste of time to look back and learn from their experience and their comparable thinking process.\nThe most advanced theory of Physics is called String Theory . It was based on the so called Beta Function of Euler which describes the behavior of the string of a violin. The people that started the quest for the ultimate theory of physics highly believed in the harmony of the spheres, a concept promoted by the ancient scientist Pythagoras. Pythagoras was educated at the university of Heliopolis in Egypt.\nInteresting enough the most promising variant of String Theory is called Loop Theory . It supposes that strings make close loops around flat surfaces called Branes . Just like our ancestors the creators of String Theory strongly believe in the concept of the closed cycle and there is a reason for this.\nThe simple reason is that you have to close our Universe somewhere. Our Universe is very big but there is a horizon, an end of the Universe, which is expanding into the nothing.\nThe smallest particles we can imagine also have a boundary and this boundary is closing the particle. Closing a system needs something that is closed in itself, a circle, a cycle or every other concept that returns in itself.\nOne of the most important ancient concepts of closure is the Ouroboros . It represents a snake that is eating itself. If you imagine the eating snake you will see that this snake compresses itself into a point and finally disappears into the nothing.\nThe modern mathematical term for the ultimate vanishing point is a Singularity , a hole in space and time, sometimes called a black hole.\nA black hole is really the entrance to the singularity. It attracts matter in our space while the white hole ejects matter in a different space. The Ouroboros disappears but comes back in another world and starts to expand again. Modern theory supposes that our Universe has expanded out of the Singularity and will move back into this singularity, just like the concept of the Ouroboros is showing.\nThe ancient concepts are not of our days but they describe the same theory in a completely different way because the old scientists where using Nature as the Source of their concepts.\nIf the old scientists came with a comparable theory using different terms the big question is how they did it. They could not use the Large Hadron Collider to observe the small and the Hubble Telescope to observe the big. Their only instrument was the eye.\nAs Above, So Below\nThe ancient scientists used the rule \u201cAs Above, So Below\u201d to make things easy for them.\nIf the old scientists would be asked to explain this statement in our terminology they would certainly make use of the concept of recursion. Recursion shows itself in the Russian dolls that contain dolls that contain dolls. The ancient scientist believed that the same rules repeat on every level of the Universe.\nThey also believed that every system is closed in itself. The Big Structures are connected to the Small Structures.\nThe point of positive Infinity is connected to the point of negative Infinity. The Up, the Down, Forwards and Backwards move around in a pattern called the Moebius Ring (the Symbol of Inifinity). In higher dimensional space this pattern transforms into the Klein Bottle , the basic structure behind Alchemy .\nIf you understand one level you understand every level.\nIn 1982, Beno\u00eet B. Mandelbrot formulated the same theory in his book The Fractal Geometry of Nature. In this book he coined the term \u201cfractal\u201d to name his recursive structures. At this moment many important physicists are convinced we live in a fractal universe .\nThe theory of the fractal universe implies that when you observe carefully with the human eye on our level of existence you are able to formulate a theory about every level of the Universe.\nThe old scientists went a little bit further and stated that our Inner Universe is also an expression of the Outer Universe (\u201cAs Within, So Without\u201d). They united physics and psychology in one Theory of Everything.\nCarl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) was a follower of the famous Sigmund Freud until he met Wolfgang Ernst Pauli (1900-1951). Wolfgang Pauli was a genius and devoted much of his time to Physics. In 1945 he received the Nobel Price for Physics. At that time Albert Einstein called him his intellectual successor.\nWolfgang Pauli started to visit Carl Jung around 1930. At that time his life was in a terrible mess and Jung started to analyze his dreams just like Sigmund Freud had told him to do.\nThe Dream of the World Clock\nJung detected many ancient themes in the dreams of Pauli. One of the most famous dreams of Pauli is the dream of \u201c the World Clock \u201c. This dream is a modern version of the dream of Ezekiel and the Tetramorph .\nThe dreams of Pauli were highly related to the hermetic alchemists of the Renaissance (John Dee, Robert Fludd, Paracelcus).\u00a0 The alchemists based their theories on the Ancient Egyptian Knowledge of Heliopolis.\nPauli and Jung started a life long collaboration to explore the bridge between the Inner World of Psychology and the Outer World of Physics.\nJung was also highly interested in what was called the Pauli Effect. Wolfgang Pauli\u2019s life was full of strange and meaningful occurrences of Telekinesis. Objects in the surroundings of Pauli started to lift without any physical explanation.\nFinally Jung and Pauli were convinced that the Dream World, the Unconsciousness, was the primal source of inspiration. They also believed that this highly unknown part of the inner world of the human being was able to affect the outer world by producing meaningful signs. The telekinetic effects of Pauli were created by his own Unconsciousness.\nThey even believed that the force behind human creativity, Spirit, created and sustained the outside material world of our senses.\nPauli was one of the creators of a weird theory called Quantum Mechanics. The predictions of this theory were verified with the instruments of science and proved to be right all the time. The theory was weird because it detected a strange duality in physical reality. Light showed itself as a particle and a wave at the same time.\nMale (White) and Female (Black) with the Black and White Hole\nTo explain this duality scientists moved far back in history and adopted the ancient Yin/Yang-concept as an explanation. This concept describes a constant cyclic movement of the Universe between two opposites, called Female and Male. When the two opposites are combined they are voided into Nothing. The three parts, Male, Female and the Void were called the Trinity.\nThe scientists of Quantum Mechanics proved that it was possible to influence this duality by the human mind of the observer when the two complementary parts of the mind unite and are voided. This happens when the human meditates or moves into trance.\nIn the meditative or trance state the brain resonates and entangels, becomes One, with the Electro-Magnetic Waves of Mother Earth, the Shumann Resonance , and the Waves of Life of the Universe.\nIn the strange terminology of Quantum Mechanics this state is called a Quantum Superposition and the union of the waves is called Quantum Entanglement . Quantum Entanglement moves with a speed much higher than the Speed of Light.\nSometimes the fragmented Tones of the Universe unite into one Symphony when the Strings of the many Violins are in Tune. Pythagoras, trained in ancient Heliopolis, explained the same thing a long time ago.\nTo explain Quantum Mechanics the scientists had to assume that our Universe is not the only Universe that is in existence. To solve the paradoxes they created the concept of the Parallel Universes. The only bridge between these universes is the Hole in Time/Space, the Singularity, which was there before the Duality came into existence.\nThe Symbol of the Heart\nThe old scientists agreed on the number of seven parallel Universes. They are a combination of two Trinities, the upside Triangle of the Spirit and the downside Triangle of the Material World.\nThey\u00a0called these Universes Heavens and Hells with our Universe, the Universe of the Heart , \u00a0in the Middle.\nThey believed that the Shaman could travel between these universes in Space and Time with the help of his Light Body .\nThey also believed that the Human Soul, the Light Body, travels these universes in between the time of reincarnation.\nIn our Western World the Great Spirit of Creation is something many people consider a very old fashioned concept. The funny thing is that at this moment the new scientists introduce the same concepts the ancient scientists were using but with a different name. The modern Material Universe and the old fashioned Spiritual Universe are merging. The only thing we don\u2019t want to accept is that the source of our creation could be a conscious being.\nThe discussion about Human Consciousness is a very complex discussion. The main reason is that scientists don\u2019t agree about the concept itself.\nConsciousness is often confused with Intelligence. Intelligence is the ability to be creative, to find simple solutions for complex problems. Consciousness is the ability to be aware of your own actions.\u00a0We need our Consciousness to learn from our mistakes. We need our Intelligence to create new solutions to make new mistakes to start learning again.\nThe Celtic Cross with the Four Forces and the Center, The Void, in the Middle.\nMost people believe that Humans are the only organisms on earth that are Intelligent and Conscious. They accept the possibility that somewhere in our huge universe a comparable situation exist where extraterrestrials live. This possibility increases with the day because our highly advanced instruments are now able to detect comparable planets orbiting comparable suns in the galaxy.\nThe big problem is still the speed of light. According to the relativity theory of Einstein this speed is the maximum speed to travel space. Our possible companions in the universe are so far away that will be impossible to communicate with them.\nOur advanced science is solving this problem too. At this moment scientists believe that the singularity now called a wormhole could make it possible to shorten the distance in space. If they are right space/time-travel will be soon a fact of life.\nSome people believe animals are Intelligent and Conscious. They feel that their cat or dog or horse looks and acts a lot like the human being. Because of this believe they treat their pets just like human beings.\nScientists are already able to construct artificial humans and pets. \u00a0They are convinced it will not take a long time to produce artificial human beings that are not distinguishable from the normal human being.\nScientists are desperately trying to define a difference between a conscious and intelligent\u00a0machine and a conscious and intelligent human being and they are not succeeding at all. Soon they have to admit that their experiments with artificial life show that consciousness and intelligence are\u00a0the properties of a fractal system.\nThe Game of Life is played on the Square\nThe old scientists already believed that our universe is a highly intelligent conscious fractal machine put in motion by a creator to experience all the possibilities of his own potential. The creation machine, the Matrix , gave the creator the opportunity to experience itself, to become fully conscious.\nWe, the Humans, are an enfolding of the Creator into a deeper level of existence. We are not created by his image we are in his image. If we look deep in the mirror of ourselves we are able to see the creator.\nThe old scientists even believed they had broken the code of the software of the creation machine and therefore could become an immortal being, the creator of a new parallel universe, themselves.\nConsciousness is created when the self encounters the self by a short or a long feed-back loop.\nIf this is true the Cycles are there to become aware of the machine and to break the code of the software of the machine to become a fully creative entity. When the self encounters and accepts the mirror of the self they merge into the nothing, the state of the Universe before the singularity came into existence.\nThe Mystery\nThe ancient scientists did not believe that the state of the Nothing was not existent. They believed that the primal state of creation was pure potential. It was a highly fluctuating state called the zero-point-field by our scientists and the Mystery by the old scientists. The zero-point-field generates everything that is possible.\nIt produces mysteries, things we cannot imagine, because we as parts of the enfolding are unable to imagine every thing that could exist. Our bodily pattern recognizer, the Brain, is not capable of doing this. Imagining every thing would turn our brain into a state of pure madness.\nMadness and sickness is a state of the body ancient and modern humans have experienced through history. This state has many names in our current highly specialized society. The old scientists believed that Spirit was able to help people to become sane and healthy again.\nThey believed in independent conscious beings with a positive and a negative attitude. The Trinity and its many enfoldings on different levels (Archangels, Angels) could be asked to erase the negative powers to let the love of the Spirit heal the body and the soul.\nThe Four Humors, the Four Forces of the Inner World\nThe ancient scientists named the force that heals the Force of Life. They believed in four other forces called the Four Elements (Air, Fire, Earth and Water) with the Force of Life, the Void, in the Center.\nThe first two Forces, Male and Female, are part of the first Trinity, the Spiritual World. Male and not-Male are voided in the Void. They are opposites just like expanding space, Gravity (Fire, Heaven) and not-expanding, compressing, space, the Strong Nuclear Force (Earth). Its main job is to hold together the subatomic particles of the kernel of the Atom. In the beginning God, the Void, created the Heavens and the Earth.\nOn the second level of Enfolding of the Trinity, the Material World, four combinations of Male and Female are possible. Two of them (Male/Male = Male, Gravity, Female/Female = Female, the Strong Force), are part of the Spiritual World and repeat their existence in the Material World.\nThe two other forces, the Electro Magnetic Force (\u201cLet there be light\u201d) of Life and the Weak Force (Radioactive Decay, Darkness) of Death are a mixture of both Male and Female and are therefore oscillating forces. They are compressing and expanding and therefore look like waves (Water and Air). These forces are also voided in the Void which shows that the potential of the Void, the Force of Life, is available at every level of existence.\nThe ancient system of Physics was a highly logical, mathematical system just like our current theory of Physics is. It contained just two concepts expansion (Female) and compression (Male) and showed that the spiraling vortex of creation was a repeating combination of the Expansion of just two simple dynamic concepts that were in a balance all the time. They knew that in the end everything would be Compressed to return to the Mysteriouss creator, the Void, the State of Infinite Potential.\nSri Yantra, the Machine that generates the Matrix\nThe ancient scientists used the terminology of Nature to explain their theory to the masses. They also used highly abstract geometric theories to calculate the movements of the levels of the fractal universe. These theories were only available for the initiates of their secret societies.\nThe main reason was that they were afraid of misuse of the power of their knowledge. Science was not only related to the game of invention but it was also a state of mind. Ethics, Physics, Art and Religion were expressions of the same fractal structure of the Universe, that originated out of the Love, the Attraction of the Void,\u00a0\u00a0the First Creator, for his own Mirrors.\nThe force that heals is still there and science is again on the verge of the rediscovery of ancient practises. The weird science of Quantum Mechanics proved the power of the mind and the force of life returned when the Mystery of the Void was transformed into the zero-point-field.\nThe power of the mind explains the placebo-effect feared by scientists who want to cure the body with chemical structures that exist on a very low level of the enfolding of the fractal universe. The pharmaceutical industry is using conscious entities (chemical forces) with little power while the powerful forces of the Archangels are still there.\nThe believe of the scientists in the healing power of nature itself has disappeared. They wanted to beat Nature with brains that are part of Nature itself. They wanted to beat their selves instead of uniting the male and female parts of their brains to become whole again.\nThis blog is a chapter of a new book I am writing together with Steven Strong about the ancient knowledge of the Aboriginals. According to their stories one part of humanity decided a long time ago to stay close to nature.\nThe Trickster in the Dream of the World Clock\nIn the dreamstate they saw the consequences of the steady increase of dominance of technology when the humans would start with agriculture. They believed Nature would take care of them when they lived according to the Dreaming. I think they were right.\nThe move from hunter/gatherer to farmer produced the advanced civilizations of the World. Everyone of these civilizations did not survive the strange behaviors of Mother Nature, the Trickster , also called the Demiurg , represented by the Raven in the World Clock of Pauli.\nI also think they forgot one thing. They forgot that the Cycles of the Wheel of Fortune of the Matrix we live in are a Machine that moves Back and Forth. It move far away from the Void into the Darkness to return back into the Light of the Mysterie.\nThe ancient scientists could calculate the short and long cycles of history and predicted a new Golden Age. They incorporated the predictions in their stories, buildings and artifacts. They knew that their scientific ancestors would try to explain their weird theories.\nThey knew that one day ancient science and modern science would converge because the cycles predicted that.\nThey knew that independent minds would return in every step of the cycle to repeat the same story again and again with different words and different concepts. They knew that history repeats itself all the time.\nThe only thing that is left for us is to take the consequences of our current understanding of our Universe.\nDo we want to fight Nature with our technology until Nature fights back to create a new balance or do we want to return to the old knowledge of the Aboriginals and start again to cooperate with our Mother Earth.\nThe choice is yours.\n"}, {"score": 2428.672, "uuid": "1c7e0cc5-cd77-5e7b-85ec-503852564a8e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1116wb-79-19308", "target_hostname": "scripturalphysics.org", "target_uri": "http://scripturalphysics.org/qm/qmconcpt.htm", "page_rank": 1.2794193e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Intuitive Concepts in <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>", "snippet": "Also, remember <em>what</em> I said in my opening comments, that &quot;<em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> bridge&quot; <em>between</em> our accessible world <em>and</em> <em>the</em> <em>quantum</em> world. <em>Quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em> <em>is</em> not <em>the</em> <em>quantum</em> world itself.", "explanation": null, "document": "Scriptural Physics Home Page\nPurpose And Scope Of This Article\nThe purpose of this article is to foster the development of intuitive concepts in atomic physics so that knowledge in this field will become more accessible and understandable to a larger group of people than is currently the case.\u00a0 The term, \"atomic physics\" will include quantum mechanics, but will not be limited to just this one particular field or its particular method of exposition. Conceptual problems in physics manifest themselves mostly at the extremes of the very small, very large, very slow, or very fast. They are just as apparent in astronomy and astrophysics, for example, as they are in quantum mechanics.\nPhysicist\u00a0 P. C. W. Davies notes that \"Quantum mechanics is one of those subjects that usually comes right in the end, even though it can seem horribly obscure when only half-learned.\" Indeed, your first encounter with a book on quantum mechanics will probably leave you with the impression that it is an arcane, abstract, almost impenetrable topic. This particular science is filled with mathematical \"maps of hell\" written in strange notation seemingly incomprehensible to all but sorcerers or geniuses. The concepts you will encounter are also disorienting, namely things like\u00a0 matter waves, probability amplitudes, non-locality, negative energy, tunneling, various paradoxes, clumsy, inelegant fudge factors, inexplicable constants, \"principles\" of indeterminacy and uncertainty, intrinsic spin, ridiculous models of the atom, quantum jumping, and so forth. And, as though all these problems were not enough,\u00a0they raise \"fundamental philosophical questions about the nature of reality.\"\nInstead of quantum mechanics becoming clear \"in the end\" as Davies notes, it would be very desirable to make it clear \"from the beginning.\" I hope that this goal can be achieved by giving a synopsis of the perplexing factual issues, some suggestions about crucially important intuitive concepts, and in finding an introductory \"middle ground\" \u00a0for the mathematics. I hope this will\u00a0 make early encounters with this topic a bit less abrasive for everyone interested in this topic.\nI am not a physicist. Nor do I have the time or resources or background to pursue a full exposition of this important topic. I can only offer some suggestions about how conceptual problems in quantum mechanics could be resolved. It is my hope that others will build on these insights, and share their findings just as I am attempting to do. I regret that I do not have the time to write an actual article on this topic; the presentation here uses the \"under construction format\" and is therefore a bit disjointed. Nevertheless, I hope it will be of some value to the diligent and patient reader. And I hope readers will share their insights with me. My prime reason for publishing this \"stuff\" is so I can learn more myself. (And you will probably see my particular personality type in what I write: http://typelogic.com/intj.html , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(role_variant ) ; http://typelogic.com/istj.html )\nNear the beginning of the twentieth century, scientists were confronted with many factual mysteries pertaining to microphysical phenomena. The classical, or Newtonian, mechanics was completely inadequate to deal with these mysteries, and so a new type of mechanics was invented: quantum mechanics. If you love good mysteries, you will find these to be among the best that the physical universe has to offer. I rate them as best in cleverness and best in ultimate importance. Despite their superficial simplicity, they have not been solved, not even by the most brilliant minds using the best equipment available to science. Quantum mechanics gives us \"recipes\" to get useful numerical answers, but despite 75 years of research, there is STILL no generally accepted explanation for the mysteries described below. The human mind will not rest until they are solved. Can you solve them?\nWhat is Quantum Mechanics?\nQuantum mechanics is \"The modern theory of matter, of electromagnetic radiation, and of the interaction between matter and radiation; it differs from classical physics, which it generalizes and supersedes, mainly in the realm of atomic and subatomic phenomena.\" (McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, 5th ed.)\n__________\n\"\"Quantum mechanics\" is the description of the behavior of matter and light in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen. . . . Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to, and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone\u0097both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to. . . . We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience.\" (The Feynman Lectures on Physics, R. P. Feynman, R. B. Leighton, M. Sands, 1965 (Addison-Wesley ), Vol 3, p. 1-1 under \"Atomic Mechanics\")\n__________\n\"In the short period of 1925 to 1928, Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Born, Dirac and many others laid the foundations of what is one of the greatest theories of all time, the theory of quantum mechanics. In generality and in range of application, it is unsurpassed. It has been so successful that one cannot discuss atomic and nuclear matters without some understanding of this basic theory.\n\"Because the predictions of quantum mechanics agree with so many different types of accurate, careful, repeated experiments,\u0097the last court of appeal for all theories\u0097this theory is almost certain to become a permanent part of man's equipment for understanding and analyzing a large and very important part of nature. However its conceptual foundations or philosophy may change in the future, it has already, in a thousand ways proved its utility and power.\" (Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Chalmers W. Sherwin, 1959, (Holt, Rinehart and Winston ),\u00a0 pages 6,7)\n__________\n\"Why is it so hard to learn? Students find quantum mechanics tough going for two reasons, one conceptual, the other technical. Familiar concepts like speed, size, acceleration, momentum and energy take on weird features, or even become meaningless. Intuition gained from daily experience is of no help, or can even be misleading. The student must learn to think about mechanical concepts in a completely different way. Some of the conceptual issues are still a matter of dispute among physicists and have raised fundamental philosophical questions about the nature of reality and the role of the observer in the physical universe. . . . On the technical side, the mathematical description of quantum processes is rather abstract, and not very obviously related to the subject of its description. Physical quantities are represented by mathematical objects with unusual properties. Some of the mathematics is also often new to the student and learning it can be an additional burden\" (Quantum Mechanics, P. C. W. Davies, 1984, (Chapman and Hall), pages ix, x)\n__________\n\"Quantum mechanics provides a good example of the new ideas. It requires the states of a dynamical system and the dynamical variables to be interconnected in quite strange ways that are unintelligible from the classical standpoint. . . . The justification for the whole scheme depends, apart from internal consistency, on the agreement of the final result with experiment. (The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, P.A.M. Dirac, 4th ed., (1958), p. 15)\n__________\nNewtonian mechanics, also known as classical mechanics,\u00a0is the mechanics used to describe the behavior of familiar, ordinary objects like cars, levers, gears, the forces on ships in the sea, the stresses in bridges and buildings, the trajectories of cannon balls, etc. Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of extremely tiny discrete objects like atoms and photons (light). Quantum electrodynamics is the modern extension of quantum mechanics to include the realms of electricity, magnetism, and light. In quantum mechanics, the discrete or \"quantized\" nature of matter and energy is prominent. In continuum mechanics (classical field theory) this discrete nature is unimportant.\nQuantization is actually a fairly ordinary concept. The real heart of quantum mechanics is revealed by a phenomenon called \"interference\". It is, in physicist Feynman's words \"the only mystery\". It is \"impossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way.\" It also points to one of the most fascinating things you will learn in the study of quantum mechanics:\u00a0 the Universe seems strangely \"overbuilt.\" It uses fantastic, seemingly unimaginable machinery, to create ordinary appearances.\nThe Basis for\u00a0 Intuitive Concepts\n\"Intuitive\", as used here, is intended to mean \"credibly constructed, logically and conceptually clear\". If you have a well-educated intuition, it might even mean \"self-evident\", but most readers won't find the ideas presented here to be that obvious. I would also like to think that mathematics qualifies as natural and intuitive. Unfortunately, most people regard math as arcane and abstract.\u00a0 So for now, I have kept the math to a minimum in this presentation.\nTwo realizations are necessary to see a path to intuitive concepts in quantum mechanics:\n1. All physical phenomena and physical entities in the physical universe can be described in terms of pure space/time or time/space ratios. The ratios may have active (i.e., progressing) components in time, space, or both. They can be active in one, two, or three dimensions. The ratios may be inherently linear or rotational. Ratios may enter into relationships with other ratios.\n2. The commonly used space-time reference system is incapable of fully depicting\u00a0the true, ultimate character of these ratios.\nMy view here is somewhat like that of the Copenhagen Interpretation: \"Quantum theory is not a representation, much less a description, of quantum reality, but a representation of the relationship between our familiar reality and the quon\u0092s utterly inhuman realm.\" (Quantum Reality, Nick Herbert, 1985, p 144) In other words, quantum mechanics is the bridge between our accessible world and a strange inaccessible world. It is simply a pragmatic way of coping with the limitations of the reference system.\nThe first step in developing\u00a0 intuitive concepts in quantum mechanics or physics in general, is to realize how the commonly used reference system misleads our intuition:\nSpace and time must always be treated as a ratio. But our reference system treats space and time as though they are independent and unrelated.\nSpace is viewed like a container or background, \"in\" which events occur. Physical phenomena, however, especially that in quantum physics, may involve only 1 spatial unit. There is no \"inside\" to this space. Nor are there positions or trajectories, at least not in the way we commonly think about them. All activity at one spatial unit must be temporal.\nTime is similarly viewed as a setting by which the occurrence of events can be ordered. But time is actually three-dimensional, and our contact with it through the reference system is one-dimensional. Strict notions of causality and determinism (\"A comes before B and causes C\") break down. The temporal relationships of the phenomena are reduced to mere probability amplitudes in the context of the reference system.\nFor large scale phenomena, a position in coordinate time maps into the spatial system in a random manner. Phenomena that are extremely isotropic and homogeneous like cosmic rays, and cosmic background radiation, represent temporal phenomena (or temporal structures) as seen from a spatial reference system.\nBecause a particle has two types of position (one in coordinate space and another in coordinate time), there are also two types of \"mechanics\" to describe its motion. Spatial motion (s/t) is described by Newtonian mechanics in terms of paths, trajectories, and forces. A particle's temporal motion component, however, has no path or trajectory as seen from a spatial reference system. A path in three-dimensional time simply cannot be described directly with spatial terminology. Instead, its description requires \"non-path\" mathematical tools like the expression for total energy and potentials as found in the Hamiltonian . Changes in location, rather than the locations themselves, can also be described, and this leads to differential equations like Schr\u00f6dinger's wave equation. Temporal locations are \"non-local\" in the spatial system (the temporal origin is anywhere/everywhere because it is a \"when\" description, not a \"where\" description. It just \"doesn't care\" about spatial locations.) This requires mathematical tools that have \"infinite reach\" like Schr\u00f6dinger's wave equation, Heisenberg's infinite matrices, and Feynman's method of \"sum over all possible paths\". These characteristics also lead naturally into the concepts of superposition of multiple states, probability amplitudes, and of \"reality\" being intertwined with the measurement system, rather than existing in an independent way. The type of mechanics that addresses these temporal aspects is called \"Quantum Mechanics\".\nThe two kinds of locality offer a conceptual framework for single photon interference in a two-slit appartus. The spatial version of the photon goes through one or the other slit. But the temporal version is delocalized (is anywhere/everywhere from the spatial standpoint) and \"encounters\" both slits. The effects combine in a way that results in what is called \"single photon interference\". (see discussion below )\nIntrinsic temporal motion (t/s) may be attached to a spatial object. The most obvious example is gravitation. Again, such a motion has no path in space. It simply does not know or care about spatial direction. Hence, the motion is non-directional in a spatial reference system. It can be described as a spherically distributed motion, or as an inverse square force that causes such motion. Such motions are described with \"field equations\" like Maxwell's instead of force equations like Newton's.\nPhenomena that seem to be connected, but not in or through space (\"non-locality\" ), have their connections in coordinate time which simply cannot be seen in a spatial reference system. The EPR paradox is a good example of this. Two correlated photons can remain in the same temporal location even though their spatial locations become widely separated. They are \"together\" in one sense and \"apart\" in the other.\nThe maximum speed that the spatial reference system can portray as a change of position in space, is, c, the speed of light. The space/time (or time/space) phenomena itself is not affected by reference system limitations and can display enormous energies, enormous redshifts, and other characteristics that are incomprehensible in the context of such a reference system. Speeds in space are always less than c, and speeds in time are always greater than c.\n(I have written much more about space/time characteristics in Advanced Stellar Propulsion Systems .)\nPhysicists themselves hope for a theory that is simpler than the mess we have today, and even believe such a thing is possible:\n\"We have come to the conclusion that what are usually called the advanced parts of quantum mechanics are, in fact, quite simple. The mathematics that is involved is particularly simple, involving simple algebraic operations and no differential equations or at most only very simple ones. The only problem is that we must jump the gap of no longer being able to describe the behavior in detail of particles in space.\" \u0097The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Feynman, Leighton, Sands, (1965) Vol. 3, p. 3-1\n\"All physical theories . . . ought to lend themselves to so simple a description that even a child could understand them.\" \u0097Albert Einstein\n\"However, if we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist.\"\u00a0 \u0097A Brief History of Time, Steven Hawking, 10th ed. (1998) p. 191\n\"The beauty of physics lies in the extent to which seemingly complex and unrelated phenomena can be explained and correlated through a high level of abstraction by a set of laws which are usually amazing in their simplicity. In the history of this abstraction, no triumph has been more spectacular than electromagnetic theory.\" \u0097Principles of Electrodynamics, Melvin Schwartz, 1987, p. 105\n\"Richard Feynman was able, in his PhD thesis, to reformulate quantum mechanics into a single, complete system of mechanics that includes all of classical mechanics as well. Feynman's mechanics, based on the Lagrangian, is all you need to explain all of mechanics, from the motions of the stars to the motions of electrons. For obvious reasons, this is often known as the path integral formalism of quantum theory. . . . It is actually much easier, in terms of the mathematics, to work with the Lagrangian than with the alternative Hamiltonian approach (which, through a historical accident, is the way most people are introduced to mechanics); John Wheeler, who was Feynman's PhD supervisor, says that his thesis, presented in 1942, marked the moment 'when quantum theory became simpler than classical theory'. If only teachers of physics in schools had the sense to teach mechanics from the beginning using the Lagrangian formalism, students could learn both classical and quantum mechanics at once, using equations that are easier to manipulate. One of the main reasons why quantum mechanics often seems difficult when students do encounter it is that they have to unlearn all the old stuff first.\" (Q is for Quantum:\u00a0 An Encyclopedia of particle physics, John R. Gribbin, 1998, p.202-203)\u00a0 See also\nhttp://www.eftaylor.com/pub/CallToAction.pdf , http://www.eftaylor.com/software/ActionApplets/LeastAction.html , http://www.eftaylor.com/pub/ForceEnergyPredictMotion.pdf , http://www.eftaylor.com/leastaction.html , http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~phys16/Textbook/ch5.pdf\nIn spite of this wish, things have only gotten worse. The public can now watch the development of String Theory, with its multiple universes and eleven dimensions, on public television. This is certainly another theory that is headed off into the weeds. At the other extreme we have the \"Saturday evening theoreticians\" who come up with their own theories that have obvious flaws. Ask any university professor and he will tell you that there are thousands of them (and that he gets emails from all of them). What I am hoping for is a fresh start, one that begins with a sound premise, uses sound methodology, and produces clear \"ideas\" that will lead into the development of a complete theory.\nNow let's consider some of the factual and conceptual problems physicists have had to wrestle with.\nCounterintuitive Quantum Mysteries\nThomas Young's classical double slit experiment of 1801 provided unambiguous and convincing evidence that light has a wave nature. He used an apparatus like the one represented in the diagram below:\nIf light consisted of particles traveling in straight lines, one would not expect the maximum light intensity to appear directly behind the \"shadow\" of the central blockage between the two slits. And if light were particles, there would be no periodic waviness of the intensity of\u00a0 the pattern on the screen. If light were particles, another slit should mean more light. And where more light is expected, there should be more light, not darkness. However, all these problems are resolved if light is behaving as a wave.\nThis was one of those historical experiments that every student of physics is practically required to perform. In college physics we would smoke up a microscope slide and create two slits in the smoke film by placing two razor blades together and lightly scoring a double line in the smoke film. Then we would hold the slide up to our eye and look through it at a bare-filament bulb (or even a distant street lamp) . The (multicolored) diffraction/interference pattern could easily be seen. A more modern version of this experiment uses an ordinary classroom pointing laser. The laser is shined on the double slit and the light projects onto a white card or paper behind it. The diffraction/interference pattern can be clearly seen on the paper (do not look at the laser beam directly).\nThe math was simple too. We could calculate the interference pattern intensity with little more than simple trigonometric relations.\nSo what is the big mystery? It is simply this: The light source can be dimmed down to the point where there is, on the average, only one photon traversing the apparatus at a time. Yet the diffraction/interference pattern still appears. In fact, in 1909, G. I. Taylor performed a similar experiment by photographing a diffraction pattern of a needle (instead of a double slit). He used an extremely feeble light source. A 2000 hour time exposure allowed the diffraction pattern to manifest itself on a photographic plate. The pattern was every bit as distinct as that obtained from a short exposure with a bright light source.\nSimilar experiments have been repeated many times. Short exposures with feeble sources result in photographs that have a very grainy, seemingly random pattern of exposed spots. Somewhat longer exposures are also very grainy, but also reveal that a pattern is beginning to emerge. Much longer exposures with the same dim source finally show a full, distinct diffraction pattern. Light is acting like a particle (definite position and energy) when it hits the photographic plate, yet acts like a wave (spread out in space) when passing through both slits and creating the diffraction pattern. It acts like a particle when sent one-at-a-time through the apparatus, but the pattern on the photographic plate shows a pattern characteristic of a wave.\nTo further confuse matters, similar experiments were performed with electrons and neutrons. We commonly regard these as particles (possessing a definite position, trajectory, momentum, etc.). Yet they too produced an interference pattern. Such patterns are characteristic of waves, not particles. \u00a0 How can waves act like particles, and particles act like waves? And like the experiments with light, the interference pattern will appear even if only one electron or neutron at a time is traversing the apparatus.\nClever experimenters have tried to determine which slit the photon or electron goes through. Suppose electrons are sent into a similar apparatus and we have a little light secretly waiting behind one of the two slits (like a traffic cop with a radar gun). As the electron flies by, a little flash of light will be reflected, and we will know which of the two slits the electron actually went through. When we actually try to do this (not exactly in this way), nature seems to get very devious. The interference pattern simply disappears and goes back to the single slit pattern (it knows the traffic cop is watching!). All sorts of clever schemes have been tried, and all end up with the same result. If the detector can somehow distinguish between the particle paths, even in principle, then there is no interference pattern!\nThese results are so counterintuitive no one would believe this actually happens unless the experimental evidence were as overwhelming as it is.\nThis diffraction/interference from one-at-a-time photons is commonplace and occurs in all sorts of optical systems, from complex to the simplest, whether we notice it or not. Consider the following illustrations:\nThe modern explanation of this paradox\u0097the wave/particle duality\u0097is that\u00a0 both light and particles have\nBOTH\na wave nature and a particle nature. The wave amplitude, and specifically the square of the wave amplitude, represents the probability density that a photon (or electron) will appear in some position on the photographic plate. It is as though the photons are being directed by an abstract mathematical wave as they fly through the apparatus. The wave is like an invisible traffic cop who splits oncoming traffic, car by car,\u00a0into a bunch of different directions, according to a definite pattern.\u00a0 The cars do not interact among themselves and no particular car knows where the other cars are going.\nPhysicist Dirac has a discussion of the interferometer problem in his book The Principles of Quantum Mechanics:\n\"Suppose we have a beam of light which is passed through some kind of interferometer, that it gets split up into two components and the two components are subsequently made to interfere. We may . . . take an incident beam consisting of only a single photon and inquire what will happen to it as it goes through the apparatus. This will present to us the difficulty of the conflict between the wave and corpuscular theories of light in an acute form.\"\nHe then describes the difficulties, presents some aspects of the theory of superposition of wave functions and emphasizes how the photon situation differs from that in classical mechanics. Then he notes the necessity of applying the probability principle to one photon at a time:\n\"Sometime before the discovery of quantum mechanics people realized that the connexion between light waves and photons must be of a statistical character. What they did not clearly realize, however, was that the wave function gives information about the probability of one photon being in a particular place and not the probable number of photons in that place. The importance of that distinction can be made clear in the following way. Suppose we have a beam of light consisting of a large number of photons split up into two components of equal intensity [think of the interferometer illustration here]. On the assumption that the intensity of a beam is connected with the probable number of photons in it, we should have half the total number of photons going into each component. If the two components are now made to interfere, we should require a photon in one component to be able to interfere with one in the other. Sometimes these two photons would have to annihilate one another and other times they would have to produce four photons. This would contradict the conservation of energy. The new theory, which connects the wave function with probabilities for one photon, gets over the difficulty by making each photon go partly into each of the two components.\u00a0 Each photon then interferes only with itself. Interference between two different photons never occurs.\" (The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, P.A.M.Dirac, 4th ed., 1958, pages 7-9)\nIn other words, this type of interference is not an en masse phenomena, like the interference of water waves that can be observed in a ripple tank. The photon in the interferometer ends up in one optical\u00a0 leg or the other, and is somehow directed to the photographic plate in just such a special way that will contribute to the build-up of a precise interference pattern, even though it may be the only photon in the apparatus during that instant of time.\nUnderstanding Dirac's concern about the conservation of energy is also crucial. Two ordinary waves, like water waves, can \"cancel\" each other if they are 180 degrees out of phase. In a ripple tank you can see two sets of waves approaching each other and you can note the spot where they would have the 180 degree phase difference. At that precise spot, the valley of one wave is filled in by the peak of the other wave, and the water surface ends up at normal height. The phenomena is well known and is called \"destructive interference.\" It finds practical application in the electronic devices that emit \"antinoise\" to make work areas quieter and in antireflection coatings on camera lenses.\nLikewise, two photon waves can \"cancel\"\u00a0 if they are 180 degrees out of phase. But people who think about this, soon find a problem with the concept. Each photon has a discrete amount of energy. \u00a0 If two photons were to interfere destructively, what happens to their energy? It cannot just disappear. Mathematically they cancel, but what happens physically? The Conservation of Energy principle is inviolate. The energy still has to go some place. Like two bullets, the two photons cannot just vanish, not even for an instant. So in quantum mechanics the wave is interpreted to denote the probability that a single photon will appear in a certain place. In quantum technobabble it is called \"the expectation value of an observable.\" This \"gets over the difficulty\", to use Dirac's own words, of the Conservation of Energy problems that would otherwise be created by both constructive and destructive interference.\nThis interpretation has a lot of factual support and has been used very successfully to predict the outcome of all sorts of extremely varied phenomena. But while it is a good description of what nature does, it leaves us utterly mystified about the how.\u00a0 How would a single photon, or electron, know where to hit the photographic plate or detector? Surely it does not compute its own wave function. Surely it does not say\u00a0 \"Let's see, I am going towards a photographic plate in an interferometer, and 60% of us are supposed to end up here, 35% there, and the other 5% next to that.\" Surely it does not know how many photons have already arrived in any particular spot. If you were the Designer and Maker, how could you build something that automatically, and by its very nature, acted this way so easily and reliably? (Job 38:19-24)\n__________\nThe mystery gets even deeper when one discovers that the quantum type of interference\u00a0is also possible temporally, not just spatially. Note what physicist Mark P. Silverman has to say on this topic:\n\"The potential for quantum interference exists whenever a particle can propagate from its source to the detector by alternative spatial pathways under experimental conditions such that the exact pathway taken cannot be known. The archetypal example is the Young's two-slit experiment in which the particle, when probed, passes through one slit or the other. Unprobed, the resulting particle distribution is explicable only in terms of probability amplitudes that seemingly propagate through both slits. There is a direct temporal analogue to the two-slit experiment in which the linearly superposed amplitudes represent\u0097not alternative spatial pathways\u0097but rather the evolution of alternative indistinguishable events in time. . . .\nThe phenomenon of quantum beats . . . is intrinsic to each atom and not a cooperative interaction between atoms. In other words, the spontaneous emission from single atoms is not modulated, but registers at the detector as one quantum of light at a time; the pattern of beats (measured at one location in real time or, equivalently, at different spatial locations along an accelerated atomic beam) can nevertheless be built up by the decay of many such single atoms. This is again the old \"mystery\" of quantum interference translated to the time domain: How can independently excited, randomly decaying, noninteracting atoms produce a pattern of photon arrivals that oscillates in time? Note that the synchronization required for the beats to survive ensemble averaging does not imply that emitting atoms communicate with or influence one another. Rather, an apt analogy, if there be any, would be that of a large number of independent clocks all separately wound and set to the same time by the clockmaker.\"\u00a0 (See More Than One Mystery : Explorations in Quantum Interference, Mark P. Silverman, 1995, p. 100 to 102, ISBN 0-387-94376-5)\nIn Young's experiment the interference pattern is most easily seen on a screen placed behind the two slits. The pattern of fringes is stable and varies with spatial position, but not with time. Of course, \u00a0it is also possible to map out the interference pattern by spatially moving one little photon detector\u00a0back and forth behind the two slits, and then plotting the detected intensity versus spatial position on a graph.\u00a0 This might be done, for example, when a screen or photographic plate cannot be used. The graph shows the existence of an interference pattern, much like what is seen on the photographic plate.\u00a0 In the experiment described above by Silverman, the detector remains in one spatial location, and the intensity of photon arrival varies over time,\u00a0 instead of over spatial position. When the intensity is plotted versus time, a graph showing similar interference effects is produced. Roughly speaking, the light seems to be winking on and off with the passage of time. The specific experimental conditions imposed require this to be a temporal manifestation of an interference effect. At the single photon level, this is just as mysterious and counterintuitive as that for Young's double slit experiment.\nSome Thoughts about Intrinsic Spin\nSpace/time ratios do not necessarily progress only as a change of position in coordinate space or as a change of position in coordinate time. They can also progress as a change of direction. The ratio is thus \"doing something\" even though it is not \"going\u00a0 somewhere.\" This type of activity\u00a0 will be called \"intrinsic spin\" and is essentially the same thing as what physicists mean by the term. It is not the the spin \"of\" something. It is a space/time ratio that manifests itself mathematically as a rotation. Spin can be a space/time ratio or a time/space ratio, and may involve multiple dimensions of either space or time. Such ratios are inherently in motion (or are motion), yet because this motion is a change of direction, and not of position, atoms can form stable positional relationships with other atoms. This allows for the existence of molecules and atomic aggregates in general (material \"things\").\nIn the current vernacular spin is \"the intrinsic angular momentum of an elementary particle or nucleus, which exists even when the particle is at rest, as distinguished from orbital angular momentum\" (McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, 5th\u00a0 ed., \"spin\") In my personal concept of the atom, there are no electrons orbiting the nucleus, and the nucleus is actually the atom itself. Consequently, whatever concepts and mathematics are currently attached to \"orbital angular momentum\" must find some alternative interpretation.\nIf you are having some trouble picturing \"intrinsic spin,\" rest assured you are not alone. It is a problem for physicists too:\n\"Although one can try to picture the spin of an electron as analogous to the diurnal rotation of the Earth about its axis, this is not really satisfactory. High-energy scattering experiments probing the internal structure of the electron indicate (in contrast to the proton and neutron) that the electron is a \u0091point\u0092 particle composed of no more fundamental subunits to within an experimental limit of about 10-16 cm. [10\n-\n8\nAngstrom] If one models the electron as a spinning charged sphere of radius equal to the so-called classical electron radius . . . the resulting linear velocity of a point on the \u0091equator\u0092 of the electron surface .\u00a0.\u00a0. exceeds the velocity of light by a factor of over 170. If a smaller radius is adopted, then the violation of relativity is even greater. No classical model of electron structure, in fact, has proved adequate. It seems therefore, that spin must simply be accepted, and not structurally interpreted.\" (And Yet It Moves: Strange Systems and Subtle Questions in Physics, Mark P Silverman, 1993, p. 216-217)\n\"Evidently it is necessary to rotate a particle with intrinsic spin twice, i.e. through 4p, before its original physical state is restored. This weird double-valued aspect of intrinsic spin sets it apart from ordinary angular momentum (and intuition). It cautions us not to attach too literal a meaning to the word spin. The classical image of a body rotating about an axis is totally inadequate to describe the peculiar geometrical properties of intrinsic spin. The nature of the spin of a particle such as an electron has no direct counterpart in the macroscopic world of our experience.\" (Quantum Mechanics, P. C. W. Davies, 1984, p. 83)\n\". . . the rotation of a spin-\u00bd particle through 360\u00b0 . . . changes the sign of its spin state . . . . There appears to be a general requirement that actions which for spin-1 particles restore original states completely (such as 360\u00b0 rotations and particle interchanges), must be applied twice to recover the initial state of a spin-\u00bd system.\"\u00a0 (Quanta: a handbook of concepts, P.W. Atkins, 2nd ed., p. 268)\n\"In an introductory treatment of quantum mechanics it is very difficult to give a really adequate account of electron spin . . . . the idea of spin is intimately associated with the concept of rotation, and yet we do not succeed in demonstrating the connection between spin and ordinary angular momentum. . . . [certain spin phenomena] are clearly demonstrated in one-dimensional systems where ordinary angular momentum cannot even be defined. Since some of the important features due to spin appear without any reference to ordinary angular momentum, the \"intrinsic angular momentum\" asociated with spin must be regarded as only one of the several aspects demonstrated by the matter waves of the Dirac theory.\" (Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Chalmers W. Sherwin, 1959, p. 279)\nThere are apparently two types of intrinsic spin. I refer to them as one-dimensional and two-dimensional spins:\nA one-dimensional (2p) spin can be visualized as a disk.\u00a0 The angular displacement required for one rotation can be computed by the common formula: S=rq. Solving for q gives q = S/r and so one rotation is 2pr/r or simply 2p radians.\nA two-dimensional (4p) spin can be visualized as a sphere. \"The unit used for measuring a solid angle is the steradian. Since the area of a sphere of unit radius equals 4p , the total solid angle about a point is 4p steradians\" (Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia, 3rd ed., under \"angle\") Hence, one complete revolution in the two-dimensional sense represents the surface area of a sphere instead of twice the arc length of a circle. The solid angle for one revolution is: q = 4pr2/r2 which reduces to 4p steradians.\nThe 4p spin is the counter intuitive one that seems to have \"to go around twice to get back where it started.\" But this would be the case if you visualized the 4p spin like the stacked disks in a combination lock where you have to turn the knob backwards twice, to get the disks back into their original position. An alternative interpretation is that this\nis\ntwo-dimensional spin which can be decomposed into\nTWO\none-dimensional spins that are orthogonal.\nPerhaps one of my illustrations from Cartoomb\u0099 # 7 can make this easier to visualize:\nThe photon and the (uncharged) electron\u00a0 appear to have the 2p spin. Trying to measure their diameter may be an exercise in futility. Other simple particles like the neutron appear to use the 4p spin system. The periodicity of the Periodic Table suggests that atoms in their simplest forms (no isomers, isotopes, ionization, etc) are composed of three orthogonal spin systems:\u00a0 two 4p spins and one 2p spin. If you insist on trying to picture this, it would probably be something like a football (American type) with an end-over-end spin imposed on it ( a \"bounced football\"). All this applies to what we currently call the \"nucleus\" because, as I have said before,\u00a0 my version of the atom does not have any electron shells.\nI can just hear some of my readers saying, \"So you think the atom is made up of these perpendicular spinning sphere things. How can spheres be perpendicular?\" Perhaps some clarifications are in order lest the concepts soon become mangled beyond all recognition.\nFirstly, I mean \"orthogonal\" in the general sense of \"independent\", not in its more restricted geometric sense of \"perpendicular\". The atom can be represented by a set of numbers, say {a,b,c}, where each of these numbers represents a rotational magnitude (a frequency) and where two of the numbers, say a and b, each represent a separate rotation of the 4p type and the remaining one represents a rotation of the 2p type. Each make their own special contribution. If one were missing, the characteristics it contributes cannot be made up by those that remain (in other words, entire rows (or columns) of the Periodic Table would disappear).\nSecondly, it is best to think of the 4p rotation as\nONE\nrotation, not two. It is\nONE\nrotation of the two-dimensional type. This may seem like a strange concept, but actually most of my readers have encountered a very similar concept in highschool algebra: complex numbers. A complex number is just\nONE\nnumber that is comprised of an ordered pair of two real numbers. The two components are kept separate by the device of multiplying one of them by \u00d6-1 (usually denoted by the letter i in mathematical literature and j in electrical engineering literature, where i is conventionally used to denote an element of electric current). \u00a0 A complex number is often written out as z = x + iy. We say it consists of\u00a0 a real component (x) and an imaginary component (iy). We visualize the real numbers as members of a number line. Complex numbers are visualized as members of a number plane (called the \"z-plane\" or \"complex plane\" or \"Gaussian plane\").\nIt is important to understand that the x and y components of a complex number are independent (orthogonal). For this reason, they are plotted on axes that are perpendicular and only cross at zero. Sometimes readers confuse this use of x and y with the other x and y that were used in highschool algebra to map functions. In that case x was the independent variable, and y was the dependent variable.\u00a0 My readers probably remember doing many of those y = f(x) graphs. The function, f(x) maps a value, x, from one real number line onto another real number line which contains the value y. If you were to do a similar thing with complex functions, say w = f(z), you would need a complex plane to represent z, and (usually) another complex plane to represent w (because if w is a function of a complex variable it could also be a complex number itself).\nThe uses and properties of complex numbers are fascinating topics, especially in calculus. And you will make use of complex numbers if you study quantum mechanics (see Some Complex Fun below for some teasers about complex numbers). But for now the only essential point is to be able to think of a complex number as ONE number. If you \"look under the hood,\" you will find two components; you could say that it is ONE two-dimensional number. But conceptually, it is easier to visualize it as one (special) number.\nSimilarly the\u00a0 4p spin is just\nONE\nspin of the two-dimensional type.\nThe dimensional effects of spin are probably most readily manifested in polarization experiments. Light, which has the 2p spin system (one-dimensional), cannot pass through two crossed polarizers that are in series, but does go through if the polarizers have the same orientation:\nA beams of atoms, which have the 4p spin system (two-dimensional), can also be polarized. Atoms, however, behave quite differently than light when sent through crossed polarizers in series:\nSee also:\nThe Feynman Lectures on Physics, Feymen, Leighton, and Sands, 1965, Vol 3, lecture 5 and\nThe Structure and Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, R.I.G. Hughes, 1989, \"The Stern-Gerlach Experiment\", p. 1-8.\nThe idea that \"two-dimensional motion\" can be just\nONE\nmotion is a lot easier to visualize if the motion is linear, instead of rotational. And again you already have seen examples, although you probably never thought of them in this way. Next time you watch TV, try to visualize what is happening to the points of light on the display when the camera zooms in on a scene. The points of the scene all start moving outward and away from each other, as though they were on the surface of a (huge) expanding balloon. This happens simultaneously in the vertical and horizontal dimensions. Note that this motion is just\nONE\nmotion of the two-dimensional linear type (I personally have a lot of difficulty trying to think of it as two separate vertical and horizontal motions). This could be called \"scalar motion\"\u0097motion that has no direction. It is simply an \"outward\" or \"away\" type of motion, and can be described with one number like +1. The expansion of the Universe is a similar scalar motion, except that it is\nONE\nmotion of the three-dimensional linear type. It is also regarded as centerless.\nUsing Microsoft Windows on a computer suggests another analogy. To enlarge a viewing window you can use the familiar click-and-drag operation on an edge. This will enlarge one dimension of the Window at a time. You can also click-and-drag on a corner and enlarge two dimensions (height and width) all at once. In other words you can enlarge a Window by using two, one-dimensional motions (drags), or one, two-dimensional motion to produce the same effect. Note that there are four corners and therefore (more generally) four ways to apply the motion. This reasoning can be extended to enlarging a cube by using three, one-dimensional motions or one, three-dimensional motion. But note that the cube has eight corners and eight ways of applying the motion to produce the same effect. (The numeric magnitudes are important when figuring out how the effects of intrinsic spin\u00a0 present themselves to a spatial reference system.)\nThe intrinsic spin of the atom opposes the general expansion of the Universe and results in a phenomena that we call gravitation. It is likewise a scalar motion, but in this case it is a motion that is \"towards\" (i.e., decreasing spatial separation) rather than \"away\". Unfortunately, in the case of two objects, like iron balls, we tend to view gravitation as two separate motions, the motion of\u00a0 A towards B, and the motion of B towards A. But in reality, it is\nONE\nmotion. An \"antigravity\" device acting on A will decrease the motion of A towards B, but it will also instantaneously decrease the motion of B towards A. There would be no propagation effect because there is only\nONE\nmotion that is affected.\nThe inverse square forces, commonly known as electric, magnetic, and gravitational forces, all have different underlying scalar dimensions when treated as motions. Electric appears to be one-dimensional, magnetic is two-dimensional, and gravitational is three-dimensional, or at least has a three-dimensional distribution. A factor of c (the speed of light) would be expected to appear when relating one type to another.\u00a0 The relationship between\u00a0 electric and magnetic field intensity, for example, would be\u00a0expected to be E = c B, which is in fact the case. There should be another relation like, E= c2m which relates the strength of an electric field to that of a gravitational field. However, the only thing that appears on the scene is E= mc2 which expresses a relationship between energy and mass. It is not clear whether this dilemma results from a poorly framed question, or is a result of the mess of problems and inconsistencies in gravitational and electromagnetic theory. (see table for another instance of the c factor)\nEffects of Spin\nSpin is at the very foundation of certain features of quantum mechanics.\u00a0 It offers us a conceptual basis for the de Broglie wavelength, the all-important interference effects, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and a poorly understood effect I will call \"localization\".\u00a0 Crucial to the understanding of these properties is the idea that spin does not exist independently, but is intimately interrelated to translational motion.\u00a0 The (charged) electron has been the most studied in this respect:\n\"The fact that \"spin effects\" appear in plane waves implies that one should not regard \"spin\" as an independent kinematical property of the electron, but rather as an essential aspect of its translational motion.\" \u0097Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Chalmers W. Sherwin, 1959, p. 300\nMore recent studies of the Dirac electron theory by physicist David Hestenes have led to similar conclusions:\n\"The Dirac equation has a hidden geometric structure that is made manifest by reformulating it in terms of a real spacetime algebra. This reveals an essential connection between spin and complex numbers with profound implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Among other things, it suggests that to achieve a complete interpretation of quantum mechanics, spin should be identified with an intrinsic zitterbewegung.\"\n. . .\n\"A related mystery that has long puzzled me is why Dirac theory is almost universally ignored in studies on the interpretation of quantum mechanics, despite the fact that the Dirac equation is widely recognized as the most fundamental equation in quantum mechanics. . . . I hope to convince you that Dirac theory provides us with insights, or hints at least, that are crucial to understanding quantum mechanics and perhaps to modifying and extending it. Specifically, I claim that an analysis of Dirac theory supports the following propositions:\n(P1) Complex numbers are inseparably related to spin in Dirac theory. Hence spin is essential to the interpretation of quantum mechanics even in Schroedinger theory.\n(P2) Bilinear observables are geometric consequences of rotational kinematics, so they are as natural in classical mechanics as in quantum mechanics\n(P3) Electron spin and phase are inseparable kinematic properties of electron motion (zitterbewegung).\"\nLater, in a section about spin and Zitterbewegung (\"jittering motion\"), he offers this comment:\n\"At last we are ready to grapple with the most profound insight and the deepest mystery in the real Dirac theory: The inseparable connection between quantum mechanical phase and spin! This flies in the face of conventional wisdom that phase is an essential feature of quantum mechanics, while spin is a mere detail that can often be ignored. We have seen that it is a rigorous feature of real Dirac theory, though it remains hidden in the matrix formulation.\"\u00a0 (Annales de la Fondation Louis de Broglie, Volume 28 no 3-4, 2003, \"Mysteries and Insights of Dirac Theory\", David Hestenes, 2003; all italics are his; see also\n"}, {"score": 2425.5679, "uuid": "45884d75-7fa3-5547-843d-4fb4ca75d54d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0005wb-53-10208", "target_hostname": "onphilosophy.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://onphilosophy.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/free-will-and-quantum-physics/", "page_rank": 1.3310456e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Free Will <em>And</em> <em>Quantum</em> <em>Physics</em> \u00ab On Philosophy", "snippet": "<em>The</em> first <em>is</em> philosophically irrelevant because it <em>is</em> a purely scientific matter concerning <em>what</em> <em>the</em> best mathematical model for describing observed events <em>is</em>.

The first is philosophically irrelevant because it is a purely scientific matter concerning what the best mathematical model for describing observed events is. So it is the second that I care about.

There are many definitions of free will. Some, including myself, take free will to be essentially the power of self-determination or self-causation. In other words, you are free if you are the primary cause of your own actions. This fits nicely with a physicalist view of the world, since in it you are identified with your brain, and it is obvious that your brain could be considered a primary cause of your actions. Such a view is a compatibilist view, because it entails that the question of whether we have free will is independent of whether the universe is deterministic.\nDespite my inclinations that is not the definition of free will that I will be using here. Compatibilism in many ways is the antithesis of the determinism-indeterminism debate because it denies any significance to it. To really engage in that debate we need to make free will part of the stakes. So what is free will in the context of this debate? Many characterize it as \u201cthe ability to do otherwise\u201d, but obviously that definition doesn\u2019t say much since it could just as well be used to describe the self-determination view of free will. What is meant by this definition is that to be free one must have the ability to make a meaningful choice which is not fully determined by the preceding physical facts. In other words, one must have the ability to be an uncaused cause (interestingly giving people a property that was classically reserved for the divine).\nObviously in a Newtonian world-view there is no room for such a thing. Every event is caused and completely determined by preceding events. Which means that either the choices of individuals are determined in this way, making them un-free, or their choices are somehow made outside the physical world and cannot have any causal import. Either way free will is an impossibility. Quantum physics changes the Newtonian picture of the world. In it there appears to be room for randomness. Moreover it appears that this randomness is somehow connected to people, because observers are credited with collapsing the wave-function, which is what gives rise to it. And some take this to make room for the exercise of free will.\nThe first objection that could be raised against this leap in logic is that this is simply one interpretation of quantum mechanics. And it is a very problematic one. Most interpretations that try to overcome its problems either get rid of the collapse of the wave-function or get rid of the observer\u2019s role in that collapse. But let\u2019s be a charitable as we can and stick with this interpretation of quantum mechanics. Even so it still doesn\u2019t give the supporter of free will what they want. It opens the door for the possibility of events that aren\u2019t fully determined by preceding events, and that is part of what is required for free-will, but it doesn\u2019t leave room for a meaningful choice to be behind it, which is the other part. Perhaps I should elaborate. In quantum mechanics it is certainly true that the collapse of the wave-function happens in a way that is not completely determined by preceding events. But the collapse is also completely random. The fact that the collapse is random means that we do not have any control over it, because that would be the opposite of random. In other words this randomness is not a place where choice can have an effect. But perhaps the observer\u2019s role in sparking collapse is where their choice enters into the picture. Alas, this cannot be the case either: observers don\u2019t have a choice about whether they cause the wave-function to collapse, they always cause it to collapse.\nIn summary: quantum mechanics refutes the first of the two claims \u201cdeterminism\u201d might be a label for, as described in the first paragraph. Namely it may, under certain interpretations, be incompatible with certain ways of mathematically modeling the universe. But it has no bearing on the second claim, namely the denial of effective uncaused choices. In fact I would go so far as to say that it is impossible for any scientific theory to lend credibility to the existence of free will, so defined. Because every theory in physics will model the world using laws. And the laws of physics will make predictions about events. Those predictions will be precise, in which case the events are completely determined, or they will be statistical, in which case the actual course of events will be random and independent of human choice. Either way there is no room for uncaused causes within the course of events described by such laws; an uncaused cause is necessarily outside of any such laws.\nEverything I have said so far has been a negative claim; I have been arguing that an appeal to physics, even quantum physics, cannot justify this sort of free will. But in the process of doing so I have been playing that game which I despise so much, namely pretending that scientific findings have some bearing on this issue. I have been pretending they have some bearing to show that, even under all the assumptions made by the advocates of this sort of free will, even assuming it was Newtonian physics that was the biggest obstacle to this sort of free will (which it isn\u2019t, since, again, philosophy is independent from scientific theories), it still cannot be justified by appeals to quantum physics. Now I am going to stop playing that game \u2013 I\u2019m going to stop being a bad role model \u2013 and describe how this sort of free will can be argued for and against independently of scientific theories.\nThe question of free will is really one of how we choose understand the choices that we make and that others make, not the forces behind them (how we choose to constitute them). The forces behind them are irrelevant from a philosophical perspective. Because even if we live in a deterministic universe it doesn\u2019t make any difference to us. I don\u2019t know all the relevant physical facts about previous states of the universe \u2013 in fact I can\u2019t know them \u2013 and thus I will never be in a position to be able to predict with complete accuracy the choices of other people. In other words, as far as I am able to know there will never be any contradiction in taking myself and others to have free will of the \u201cuncaused cause\u201d sort, even if such a thing is physically impossible. But neither does this mean that I must take them to have free will of this sort. Philosophically we have a choice, we are faced with the question: \u201cwhat is the best way to conceive of the ability of ourselves and others to make choices?\u201d\nThe \u201cuncaused cause\u201d conception of free will emphasizes the randomness and unpredictability of people\u2019s choices. It emphasizes their \u201cradical freedom\u201d, their ability to make choices that go against everything that they have previously done and said. In contrast the \u201cself-determination\u201d conception emphasizes the connection between our free choices and responsibility. It emphasizes that when our choices are free that we have to own up to them. I can see both conceptions of free choice as being philosophically interesting. So described the \u201cuncaused cause\u201d conception of free will would fit nicely with a theory that was trying to encourage people to make radical choices and to fully exercise their freedom. Using this conception of free will is one way to emphasize to people that they are free to make a break with their past, their past choices, and their past conception of themselves. The \u201cself-determination\u201d conception of free will can be used to good effect in a theory where we are trying to motivate certain kinds of behavior on the basis of someone\u2019s desire to see themselves as free. Kant\u2019s ethics, specifically the Groundwork, is a good example of this. From the conception of ourselves as free agents we are supposed to concede that we are autonomous, and thus self-determining, and that the only way to be autonomous is to govern ourselves with reason.\nObviously it\u2019s not my intention to develop theories based on either of these two conceptions of free will, or the many unnamed alternatives, here. The point is merely to demonstrate that it is possible to have a lively philosophical discussion about them without having to appeal to science. In fact I think that we are far better off without dragging science into it. Because as I have framed this possible debate it is one that is going to involve philosophical systems, as we evaluate different conceptions of human choice and free will based on how they are philosophically useful. I think that this is much more interesting than deriving philosophical consequences from something that is itself unphilosophical, but maybe that\u2019s just me.\nLike this:\n"}, {"score": 2424.2795, "uuid": "8dc917c6-78d2-57c5-8f76-8aa1c3023d2d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0402wb-83-28900", "target_hostname": "onphilosophy.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "https://onphilosophy.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/free-will-and-quantum-physics/", "page_rank": 1.2337328e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Free Will <em>And</em> <em>Quantum</em> <em>Physics</em> \u00ab On Philosophy", "snippet": "<em>The</em> first <em>is</em> philosophically irrelevant because it <em>is</em> a purely scientific matter concerning <em>what</em> <em>the</em> best mathematical model for describing observed events <em>is</em>.

According to Feyerabend it is ``not a single idea but a mixed bag of interesting conjectures, dogmatic declarations, and philosophical absurdities.'' In order to set myself a limit I will not discuss all absurdities. Thus, I will ignore as an active factor in quantum measurement the `(human) observer as far as transcending his role as an experimenter setting up the measurement arrangement used to perform a measurement, or reading the data obtained by his measuring instruments' ( compare ). Even so, contributions to the `Copenhagen interpretation' by the `founding fathers of quantum mechanics' are not mutually compatible in all respects. In particular, Bohr and Heisenberg, who may be seen as the parents of the Copenhagen interpretation, might seem to be as different as the father is from the mother, the father being responsible for the philosophical genes and the mother for the physical ones. Heisenberg once said that Bohr was primarily a philosopher, not a physicist. With respect to Heisenberg the converse statement seems justified. Indeed, ` Bohr's cautious attitude with respect to ontological assertions' testifies to a considerably more careful philosophical attitude than `Heisenberg's flight into philosophical vagueness by relying on the Aristotelian notions of potentiality and actuality ' in order to arrive at an `ontological account of quantum measurement'.\nBetween `instrumentalism/empiricism'and `scientific realism'\nIn view of Feyerabend's remark it will be no surprise that it is impossible to give an unambiguous definition of what the `Copenhagen interpretation' is. A list of properties the `Copenhagen interpretation' in my view can best be characterized by is given here (column to the left) . Nevertheless there are ambiguities. Thus, whereas the `Copenhagen interpretation' has started out from an ` instrumentalist/empiricist point of view', has the state vector gradually obtained a more ` realist meaning', be it in a probabilistic sense. It is a matter of taste whether this `realism' is considered to be consistent with a `Copenhagen understanding', since this development may rather have been stimulated by the rising influence of `scientific realism' at the expense of `instrumentalist/empiricist influences' ( compare ). During a long time there has been a practice of maintaining the `idea of completeness of quantum mechanics' by considering the `state vector to be a (complete) description of an individual object '. This is amalgamating `Copenhagen instrumentalist/empiricist' and `scientific realist' ideas.\nIt is possible to draw the dividing line between `Copenhagen' and `non-Copenhagen' interpretations where the objectivistic-realist tendencies of `scientific realism' threaten to be extended to measurement. This is how I will implement this terminological issue ( compare ).\nHeisenberg versus Bohr: physics versus philosophy\nHeisenberg's main concern was with the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, dealing with it in a pragmatic physicist's `no nonsense' way, which, notwithstanding its `professed empiricism ', is probably best understood as entertaining a realist individual-particle interpretation endorsing ontological probability .\nOn the contrary, Bohr's interest was directed more towards the issue of `what we can know about microscopic reality', avoiding as much as possible `ontological statements' in dealing with the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, and even denying an ontological meaning to the wave function. This would seem to place Heisenberg and Bohr at opposite extremes of the ` ontic versus epistemic dichotomy of interpretations of quantum mechanics', thus explaining their intense disagreements on the meaning of the uncertainty principle (interpreted by Heisenberg as a `result of a physical disturbance of the object by a measurement', whereas for Bohr it was a restriction on the ` latitudes observables are defined with within the context of a measurement').\nThat Bohr and Heisenberg, notwithstanding differences, have been accepted by the scientific community as parents of a common interpretation may indicate that these differences were not experienced as particularly telling (compare my qualification of the `ontic versus epistemic' dichotomy as potentially misleading ). Indeed, it is hard to believe that the physicist Bohr would not have wanted to deal with `physical reality itself' rather than just with `knowledge': with respect to `quantum mechanical observables' (referred to by Bohr as `physical quantities') his attitude may be seen as a classically realist one -be it `modified in a contextualistic sense'-, the natural interpretation of classical mechanics being a realist one. Nor is Heisenberg's `reference to measurement' free of `epistemological implications', the latter being connected with Heisenberg's professed empiricism .\nBohr's reluctance to make `ontological statements regarding microscopic reality itself' earned him Einstein's characterization of `Talmudic philosopher'.\nBohr, Heisenberg, and `interpretations'\nBohr and Heisenberg cannot easily be understood using the present-day definitions of `interpretation of the quantum mechanical formalism' (like the realist -either objectivistic or contextualistic- and empiricist interpretations). On the other hand, it may be useful to try to apply these concepts also here. For instance, Bohr's warning against Jordan's assertion that `measurement results are created during measurement' would be futile in the `empiricist interpretation'. On the other hand, Jordan's assertion is in an ontologically-realist way corroborating Bohr's epistemological way of thinking about quantum mechanical observables (having had important implications with respect to the nonlocality issue arising from the latter's discussion with Einstein).\nWe should not forget that the quantum mechanical formalism was being developed together with its interpretation. `Classical mechanics' was the starting point for both Bohr and Heisenberg 14 . Thus, `physical quantities', in microphysics to be represented by Hermitian operators, were thought to behave classically after having been amplified to the `macroscopic dimensions necessary to render them directly accessible to human observation'. For Bohr this implied that `what we can tell about a physical quantity of a microscopic object' should be expressed in the language of classical mechanics ( compare ), and does not directly refer to a `microscopic world existing independent of the measurement arrangement'. For Heisenberg it meant that by the measurement an `ontic potentiality' was turned into an `actuality', the microscopic object being assumed after the measurement to actually have the property it prior to the measurement only had potentially. The similarity of Heisenberg's view with Jordan's one 17 may explain the occasional grave disagreements between Heisenberg and Bohr.\nEssential role of measurement\nThe new insight, common to Bohr and Heisenberg, that `measurement plays an essential role in assessing the meaning of quantum mechanics' has been sufficiently important to overlook their differences, and to unite them into one single Copenhagen interpretation, of which the essential role of measurement is the main characteristic. Notwithstanding Bohr's cautiousness, inducing him to avoid as much as possible ontological assertions, most physicists have interpreted quantum mechanical observables in Heisenberg's more ontological sense, thus subscribing to ontological indeterminism of measurement . Bohr's influence is felt if the Copenhagen interpretation is thought to entertain a contextualistic-realist interpretation of quantum mechanical observables, and an instrumentalist interpretation with respect to the wave function or state vector.\n`Copenhagen interpretation' versus `empiricist interpretation'\nIt should be recalled that, notwithstanding Heisenberg's empiricism , the `Copenhagen interpretation' is very different from the empiricist interpretation . Thus, the `Copenhagen interpretation' does not transcend the `classical idea of empiricism' in which the role of a `measuring instrument as a means to transmit information from the microscopic object to the human observer' is not (or, at least, not sufficiently) taken into account. Indeed, when reading the Copenhagen literature on quantum measurement the reader is plagued by the irritating feeling that a measuring instrument is there `just to disturb the microscopic object' (Heisenberg), or even 'just to define the measured observable' (Bohr).\nIn the `empiricist interpretation' the role of `measurement' in an unambiguous way is `to obtain information on the microscopic object by means of interaction between microscopic object and measuring instrument, transmitting information from the first to the second' ( compare ).\nThe `Copenhagen interpretation' and `experiment'\nIn assessing the importance of the Copenhagen interpretation it is not unimportant to realize that this interpretation is largely based on the experiments being performed during the time of its inception. These were mainly scattering experiments like the Compton-Simon and Stern-Gerlach experiments in which the measurement result was established by ascertaining the direction in which a particle or a photon had been scattered. Therefore Heisenberg's phenomenon could be identified with the `position of the microscopic object, actualized by the measurement' rather than by the `position of the pointer of a measuring instrument' (as is the case in the empiricist interpretation ).\nNowadays more sophisticated experiments are being performed not allowing a simple analysis like the one sufficient for such scattering experiments. In particular it is necessary to consider the `interaction between microscopic object and measuring instrument' to be able to draw conclusions about the object by reading the final position of a pointer of the instrument. Unfortunately, as a consequence of the `contextualistic-realist interpretation of observables' the role of the measuring instrument is only partly implemented in the Copenhagen interpretation.\nNegative and positive features of the `Copenhagen interpretation'\nIn the following analysis of the Copenhagen interpretation a number of its weak points will be discussed (compare the list of negative features presented here ), often stemming from too rashly accepting certain features observed in thought-provoking measurements like the Compton-Simon and the Stern-Gerlach ones as generally valid, or even as being normative for all measurements within the microscopic domain.\nNevertheless, the Copenhagen interpretation must be honoured for its insight that measurement plays an ineradicable role in assessing the meaning of quantum mechanics (compare the list of positive features presented here ). This positive feature seems to me to be of such a fundamental importance that it is worthwhile to try to update the Copenhagen interpretation so as to yield a consistent view circumventing its negative features, and to be able to also cope with the more sophisticated `present-day quantum mechanical measurements not readily describable by the standard formalism of quantum mechanics ' ( compare ).\nThe quantum postulate\nAccording to Bohr 45 each quantum phenomenon (representing a `quantum mechanical measurement event' like a `flash on a scintillation screen' or a `track in a Wilson chamber') possesses a feature of `individuality' or `wholeness', in the sense that allegedly no distinction can be drawn between `microscopic object' and `measuring instrument': object and measuring instrument are thought to constitute an `indivisible whole'. This is the quantum postulate. It marks the essential difference between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics, in the latter theory `measurement' being assumed not to play any essential role, whereas in quantum mechanics physical quantities are thought to be well-defined `only within the context of a measurement of that quantity' ( compare ).\nThe `dependence on the measurement arrangement' going with the `quantum postulate' is at the basis of the Copenhagen interpretation. It is applied (although in a rather ambiguous way ) by Bohr in his answer to the EPR challenge of the `completeness of quantum mechanics', juxtaposing `Bohr's contextualistic-realist interpretation of quantum mechanical observables' to `Einstein's objectivistic-realist one'.\nRemarks on the quantum postulate:\nThe `quantum postulate' has its physical basis in the idea of `unavoidable interaction between object and measuring instrument, disturbing the object when a quantum mechanical measurement is performed'. The non-vanishing of the \"quantum of (inter)action\" (Planck's constant h) allegedly makes it impossible either to neglect this interaction or to compensate for it. According to the `Copenhagen interpretation', due to the non-vanishing of h measurement is inducing a fundamental indeterminism or acausality , thus allegedly making unanalyzable the process of `obtaining knowledge by means of measurement'.\nDue to the essential role played by the measurement interaction the `Copenhagen interpretation' is sometimes referred to as an `interactional interpretation'. In my view the insight that the measurement interaction plays an essential role in the process of obtaining knowledge on a microscopic object is the most important aspect of the `Copenhagen interpretation' (although it is questionable whether this judgment should be extended to the Copenhagen thesis of the unanalyzability of the quantum phenomenon ).\nThe `quantum postulate' is at the basis of many features characterizing the `Copenhagen interpretation', such as ontological indeterminism during measurement , completeness in the restricted sense , correspondence , and complementarity .\nIt should be noted that, notwithstanding the empiricist terminology, in the `Copenhagen interpretation' a `quantum phenomenon' is not understood in the sense of the empiricist interpretation . A `flash on a scintillation screen' or a `track in a Wilson chamber' is not interpreted as a `property of the measuring instrument' (viz. a `chain of water drops, the formation of which being induced by ionization of water molecules triggered by a passing charged microscopic object'), but as a `property of the microscopic object made macroscopically observable by the measurement arrangement'. By Bohr quantum mechanical observables are interpreted in the contextualistic-realist sense corresponding to the latter interpretation.\nCriticisms and appraisal of the `quantum postulate'\nAmbiguity of the notion of `quantum phenomenon'\nThe `quantum phenomenon' is a rather vague and intuitive notion, being given different meanings by different adherents of the `Copenhagen interpretation'. Identifying a `quantum phenomenon' with the `coming into being of a measurement result' these differences are reflected by the differences between Bohr and Heisenberg, observed by them with respect to the notion of `quantum mechanical measurement result am'.\nMoreover, with Bohr the notion of `quantum phenomenon' has been subject to a certain evolution during the development of the `Copenhagen interpretation'. As a consequence of the idea that the nonvanishing value of Planck's constant h should be responsible for quantum jumps during a measurement , `discontinuity' 45 was initially assumed by Bohr to be a determining feature. However, `discontinuity' is absent in his later formulations, being replaced by individuality , representing a generalization of the notion of a `classical particle', in which the influence of the measurement interaction during measurement is acknowledged as an important factor. Accompanying Bohr's growing awareness of the contextual meaning of quantum mechanics while developing his complementarity principle , the emphasis has changed from an `unspecified influence of measurement' to an `influence as occurring in a specified measurement arrangement'. 46\nCriticisms of `unanalyzability of the quantum phenomenon'\nInfluence of the classical paradigm\nThe idea of `discontinuity' has been responsible for the idea that a quantum mechanical measurement is accompanied by an irreducibly indeterministic disturbance of the microscopic object, and that therefore the `quantum phenomenon' is an `unanalyzable whole' not allowing a clear distinction between microscopic object and measuring instrument (compare e.g. a track in a Wilson chamber ). It is remarkable that Bohr, notwithstanding this lack of distinction, has chosen to interpret the `quantum phenomenon' as a `property of the microscopic object' rather than as a `property of the measuring instrument'.\nProbably Bohr's classical way of thinking prevented him from going all the way towards the empiricist interpretation (in which a `quantum phenomenon' corresponds to a final pointer position, obviously being a `macroscopically observable event allowing for the classical account that according to Bohr was necessary'), but instead sending him into the direction of a ` realist interpretation of quantum mechanical observables, be it modified in a contextualistic sense'.\nBohr's `unanalyzability of the quantum phenomenon' is largely a consequence of ignoring the pre-measurement phase which is allowing a ` quantum mechanical analysis of quantum measurement' in which `microscopic object' and `measuring instrument' are duly distinguished. It seems that the `classical paradigm' stood in the way of a (quantum mechanical) analysis that later on would be helpful in obtaining a better understanding of the role of measurement in quantum mechanics.\nEinstein's challenge of the `unanalyzability of the quantum phenomenon'\nNote that in his challenge of the Copenhagen completeness thesis the `quantum phenomenon' was construed by Einstein `differently from the quantum postulate' (in particular by trying to circumvent the `influence of measurement'), viz. in the sense of the ` objectivistic-realist interpretation of quantum mechanical observables' satisfying the possessed values principle . The (alleged) unanalyzability of the quantum phenomenon has been criticized by Einstein to the extent of qualifying the Copenhagen interpretation as a ``tranquilizing philosophy''. By accepting `indeterminism (or, more appropriately , acausality) of measurement', and by consequently relinquishing any possibility of ` explaining measurement results obtained in a measurement', Bohr, according to Einstein, too hastily accepted `completeness of quantum mechanics'.\nUnfortunately, like Bohr's approach also Einstein's challenge did not transcend the `classical paradigm', thus precluding the analysis from going any deeper than the `wholeness bestowed on the quantum mechanical description by its reliance on Planck's constant'. A deeper-going analysis had to await developments based on a quantum mechanical theory of measurement, allowing a `quantum mechanical description of the interaction of object and measuring instrument', or even based on subquantum or hidden variables theories allowing contemplation of possibilities to reduce `quantum mechanical wholeness' to `subquantum properties of object and measuring instrument'.\nIt is fortunate that, notwithstanding the limited scope of Einstein's challenge, it yet did have some effect, viz. it induced Bohr to stress the contextuality of his `quantum phenomenon' (by pointing at an ambiguity of Einstein's `element of physical reality'). By this development the ideas of `discontinuity' and `irreducible indeterminism' have lost much of the importance they initially had ( compare ).\nReliance of the `Copenhagen interpretation' on the notion of `measurement'\nNowadays an often-heard criticism of the `Copenhagen interpretation' is its reliance on the notion of `measurement' induced by the `quantum postulate'. This criticism has gained momentum after the breakdown of logical positivism/empiricism had decreased the importance attributed to the `phenomena' as opposed to `microscopic reality itself' (this criticism actually goes back to Einstein's idea that a physical theory should describe an `objective observer-independent reality'). Such a criticism is challenging the notion of `quantum phenomenon in which the disturbing influence of the measurement is thought to be so essential that a certain inseparability or wholeness of the system object+measuring instrument had to be assumed'. At the basis of this criticism are the ideas\ni) that an observer-independent 9 microscopic reality exists;\nii) that an objective description of this microscopic reality is possible;\niii) that quantum mechanics itself can provide such an objective description.\nI do not share this criticism. In my view awareness of the `crucial role measurement plays in microscopic physics' is an asset of the `Copenhagen interpretation' rather than a weakness. Within the microscopic domain no information can be obtained without interaction with measuring instruments that are sensitive to the microscopic information , and capable of amplifying it to macroscopically observable dimensions. The `Copenhagen interpretation' should be recognized as having been the first to emphasize the crucial importance of this feature of microscopic physics, and to subsume it under the physics and philosophy of that domain.\nIn my view (which is based on an empiricist interpretation of physical theories) a `quantum mechanical description of microscopic reality' may be analogous to a `(phenomenological) description of a billiard ball by the classical theory of rigid bodies', suggesting a `wholeness of the billiard ball' comparable to the wholeness attributed by Bohr to a `quantum phenomenon'. `Unanalyzability of a quantum phenomenon by quantum mechanics' may be compared with `unanalyzability of the rigidity of a billiard ball if one is restricting oneself to the classical theory of rigid bodies'. Then an analysis of rigidity simply is impossible, not so much because the phenomenon would be unanalyzable in an ontological sense (for instance, because it would have no parts), but as a consequence of `insufficient resources provided by the theory of rigid bodies'. Analogously, `quantum phenomena' probably will resist complete analysis as long as Planck's constant h is an axiomatically defined term of quantum mechanics, and no physical explanation has been found for its value ( compare ).\nThe `quantum phenomenon' in the `EPR experiment'\nAccording to Bohr the EPR experiment can be understood in terms of the `quantum phenomenon' in a way completely analogous to any other quantum measurement. This unhappy analogy marks the birth of the nonlocality conundrum , the `quantum phenomenon' allegedly comprising both particle 1 and 2. It is unfortunate that the discussion between Bohr and Einstein has been restricted to EPR experiments , thus tending to emphasize `wholeness' rather than `separation' (as might obtain in `correlation measurements of the EPR-Bell type' in which two different `quantum phenomena' are to be observed -viz. Alice 's one and Bob's one- which should be considered as `separate' rather than `constituting a single whole', the experiment determining the `correlation between these separate phenomena').\nEven in the `EPR experiment' it is possible to distinguish between two different events; however, in that case Bob's event is a `preparation event' rather than a `measurement event' ( compare ), the former not easily to be equated with a `phenomenon', and hence being subject to the `Copenhagen fear of the metaphysical' ( also ).\nBy considering EPR-Bell measurements it would have been evident that, in order to test experimentally any prediction on particle 2 it would be necessary to perform a measurement on that very particle, giving rise to its own measurement arrangement, and generating its own `quantum phenomenon' by probing the `preparation event at Bob's position'.\nIt is even not impossible that Bohr had in mind something like this, as might be guessed from a famous quotation 47 in his `answer to the EPR challenge'. However, he refrained from any explicit reference to `Bob's measurement arrangement', thus summoning Einstein's conclusion of `nonlocality' (which could be ignored by Bohr on the basis of his epistemological attitude , but which was taken seriously by `more ontology-minded physicists' like Bell ).\nBohr versus Einstein on the `quantum postulate'\nSummarizing, we must come to the conclusion that on the subject of the `quantum postulate' neither Bohr nor Einstein was completely right, nor was each of them completely wrong. Moreover, if it is duly taken into account which of the ideas of each of the adversaries should be abandoned in the face of new insights, and which ones should be kept, then by hindsight we can say that their controversy over the `quantum postulate' and the related completeness thesis has been a fruitful one (rather than the metaphysical exchange it has often been considered to be) because it directed the attention to the role of measurement in studying microscopic objects.\nOn the other hand, it seems to me that neither Bohr nor Einstein was prepared to sufficiently transcend classical thinking to give the `quantum phenomenon' its proper position as a `property of the measuring instrument' rather than as a `property of the microscopic object'. Both kept thinking in terms of a realist interpretation of quantum mechanics (either contextualistic or objectivistic), neither of them contemplated the possibility of an empiricist interpretation . However, Bohr's awareness of the `fundamental role measurement plays in microscopic physics' may earn him the alleged victory over Einstein that has been unjustifiedly attributed to him on the basis of an alleged `aversion of metaphysics'.\nThe Copenhagen completeness thesis\nThe idea of `completeness of quantum mechanics' is probably the best known characteristic of the `Copenhagen interpretation', although in my view it is not the most important one ( compare ).\nThe discussion on the `(in)completeness of quantum mechanics' is obscured by the fact that two different notions of `(in)completeness' are at stake which are not sufficiently distinguished. These issues are:\ni) (in)completeness in the restricted sense , related to the `quantum postulate', being a strictly quantum mechanical notion, referring to `measurements within the domain of application of quantum mechanics';\nii) (in)completeness in the wider sense , related to the possibility or impossibility of \"hidden variables\" implying the possibility of going `beyond quantum mechanics'.\nCompleteness in the restricted sense\nThe Copenhagen thesis that `quantum mechanics is a complete theory', originating with Bohr and Heisenberg, refers to the somewhat tautological idea that quantum mechanics is describing `all possible information to be obtained by means of quantum mechanical measurements (being subject to the quantum postulate)'. This will be referred to as completeness in the restricted sense since its validity is restricted to the domain of application of quantum mechanics. It actually is a rather negative notion, its applicability being related to the ` impossibility of simultaneously determining sharp values of the quantum mechanical position and momentum observables' (which impossibility actually was a main reason for invoking the `quantum postulate'). `Completeness' should here be taken in the sense of `not completable in the sense of obtaining more information than contained in the probability distributions of the position and momentum observables (satisfying the Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality for these observables)'. It, in particular, does not refer to the question of the possibility of reconstructing the state vector from the probability distributions obtained by measuring a `quorum' of quantum mechanical (standard) observables', even though quantum mechanics actually is complete in this latter sense (cf. quantum tomography ).\nAccording to Bohr `completeness of quantum mechanics (in the restricted sense)' should be seen as a rational generalization of the `completeness of classical mechanics', where simultaneous knowledge of position (q) and momentum (p) completely determines the state (q,p). `Completeness of quantum mechanics in the restricted sense' refers to the impossibility of surpassing limitations set by the `Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality' on the joint information to be obtained about an `individual object' from measurements of the quantum mechanical position and momentum observables.\nThe `Copenhagen completeness thesis' has considerably contributed to a custom of interpreting the state vector as a description of an individual particle (object), or -if ensembles are considered at all- to the idea of a von Neumann ensemble in which particles described by identical state vectors are thought to be identical (or identically prepared) even if measurements of the same observable on such particles would yield different values. In the Copenhagen interpretation criticisms of von Neumann's interpretation are circumvented\ni) by the possibility to ignore a possible nonuniqueness of the representation of the density operator \u03c1A (as in the EPR problem) by invoking contextuality (symbolized by the index A), to the effect that only the representation corresponding to the actually measured observable A is thought to have physical relevance;\nii) by restricting attention to strong von Neumann projection (at the expense of weak von Neumann projection ) 65 by ignoring `all possible measurement results not actually realized in an individual measurement', thus leaving undiscussed the problem `that by the measurement an individual particle (represented by a pure state) is transformed into an inhomogeneous ensemble' (compare figure 3 ).\nThe Copenhagen idea of `completeness in the restricted sense' is the epistemological counterpart of the ontological assumption of irreducibility of quantum probability .\nThe \"real\" properties of a microscopic object are supposed not to be the values of observables (or physical quantities) like position and momentum, but the probabilities pm should rather be considered as such. The idea of `completeness in the restricted sense' signifies that the quantum mechanical formalism cannot be completed by specifying for each microscopic object a value the observable possessed prior to measurement.\nNote that the ` reasons for irreducibility of quantum probability' were not convincing to Einstein , who pursued a statistical interpretation of the Born rule instead of the Copenhagen `probabilistic interpretation'. Indeed, strictly speaking, the general rejection of Einstein's ideas by the majority of the physics community was far from justified at the time of the Bohr-Einstein controversy on the `(in)completeness of quantum mechanics'. Only much later formal proofs have been given, based on the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics ( compare ), demonstrating the impossibility of `incompleteness of quantum mechanics in the restricted sense'.\nCompleteness in the wider sense\nThe Copenhagen thesis that `quantum mechanics is a complete theory' is often interpreted in the sense of completeness in the wider sense, signifying the `impossibility of any subquantum or hidden variables theory'. Under the influence of ` logical positivist/empiricist abhorrence of metaphysics' `completeness in the wider sense' has become one of the main characteristics of the `Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics', which in Jordan 's ontological sense can be characterized as anti-realist . By hindsight, this interpretation is even less justified than the assumption of `completeness in the restricted sense' since the main reasons to reject `subquantum theories' (viz. i) the logical positivist/empiricist philosophy, ii) von Neumann's 1932 \"proof\" of the impossibility of hidden variables) have turned out to be obsolete as a consequence of insurmountable problems of logical positivism/empiricism , and of Bell's 1960 refutation of von Neumann's \"proof\" , respectively.\nBoth Bohr and Heisenberg contemplated the possibility that quantum mechanics could break down in new domains of experience. For instance, Heisenberg admits the possibility of the existence of trajectories of electrons (although he denies their physical relevance on the basis of their `unobservability within the quantum mechanical domain'). However, Bohr saw the `quantum phenomenon' (in particular as it is manifesting itself within complementarity ) as a model of the interplay between an observer and the observed object, having a `general significance transcending quantum physics'.\nCriticisms of the `Copenhagen completeness thesis'\nFailure to distinguish completeness in the wider sense from completeness in the restricted sense\nFailure to draw a distinction between completeness in the `wider' and `restricted' senses has been a major source of confusion. This holds true not only for the `Copenhagen interpretation itself', but also for Einstein's challenge of the `Copenhagen completeness thesis', in which challenge the `quantum mechanical observables themselves' are `conceived as hidden variables', thus assuming quantum mechanics to be a `very restricted kind of hidden variables theory '. However, it seems to be more appropriate to consider Einstein's approach as an `interpretation of quantum mechanics' (viz. an objectivistic-realist one) rather than a `hidden variables (subquantum) theory', and to see his EPR challenge of the `Copenhagen completeness thesis' as an attempt to refute `completeness in the restricted sense' rather than `completeness in the wider sense'.\nFailure to draw the distinction has had a large influence on the way Bohr's alleged \"victory\" over Einstein in the (in)completeness debate has been appreciated as a triumph of logical positivism , allegedly refuting all metaphysics by excluding `any subquantum theory'. However, arguments against the existence of Einstein's `restricted kind of hidden variables' based on peculiarities of the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics like the Kochen-Specker theorem 0 , demonstrating the impossibility of `quantum mechanical elements of physical reality'. They do not prove the non-existence of `elements of physical reality of subquantumtheories', that are not necessarily subject to the quantum mechanical peculiarities ( compare ).\nWhereas it may be justified to consider `incompleteness in the restricted sense' as falsified (no `simultaneously possessed sharp values' being attributable to the quantum mechanical `position' and `momentum' observables), is the possibility of `incompleteness in the wider sense' still wide open. Indeed, `completeness of quantum mechanics in the restricted sense' may be compatible with `incompleteness of quantum mechanics in the wider sense'. This is particularly evident in the `empiricist interpretation' of the quantum mechanical formalism, in which a clear distinction can be drawn between the `phenomena described by quantum mechanics' and the reality behind the phenomena, to be described by subquantum theories . If de Broglie's idea 0 is correct that a microscopic object is accompanied by a wave (as seems to be required by interference phenomena ), then this leaves room for the assumption that de Broglie's wave should not be equated with the quantum mechanical wave function (or with another solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation as is supposed by de Broglie), but could correspond to an `element of a subquantum theory'.\nMetaphysical character of `Copenhagen completeness'\nThe main weakness of the Copenhagen individual-particle interpretation , associating the quantum mechanical wave function or state vector with an individual object, is that it transcends present-day experimental data by assuming that the quantum mechanical wave function has replaced de Broglie's wave. It is by now evident that the wave function describes an ensemble . It is beyond observation whether perhaps it `also describes an individual element of an ensemble'. It, hence, turns out that the `Copenhagen completeness thesis' is no less metaphysical than is Einstein's idea of the existence of `elements of physical reality'. Even though Einstein's challenge of the `Copenhagen completeness thesis' was not carried out in a proper way ( compare ) is it evident that Einstein was correct when supposing that quantum mechanics is about `ensembles' rather than about an `individual particle'. Even if the `vacuum fluctuations of quantum field theory' would describe certain empirical aspects of `de Broglie's wavelike phenomenon', would the `quantum field theoretical description' still refer to an ensemble rather than to an individual object.\nThe main reason for the `Copenhagen completeness thesis' is the `quantum postulate', and not the `logical positivist' idea (based on the notion of a von Neumann ensemble ) that an ensemble interpretation would not be opportune (because properties distinguishing `different individual objects described by identical state vectors' would not be experimentally verifiable). On the contrary, it could be retorted that by not duly distinguishing `completeness of quantum mechanics in the restricted sense' from `completeness of quantum mechanics in the wider sense' progress of science has been hampered because it implied a belief in the universal validity of quantum mechanics, thus discouraging attempts to experimentally probe the limits of the domain of application of quantum mechanics.\nThis also induces the question of whether `measurement disturbance as involved in the quantum phenomenon' is a `fundamental characteristic of all measurement in the microscopic domain', or whether it is just an `artefact of the kind of measurements that are within the domain of quantum mechanics'. If `completeness' is taken in the `restricted sense', then the `Copenhagen interpretation' does not exclude the latter possibility, implying that future experimentation may require theories different from quantum mechanics (i.e. subquantum theories ), capable of more fully analyzing (in terms of `subquantum properties') the measurement procedure than is possible using quantum mechanics. If the `quantum postulate' is applicable only to `quantum mechanical measurements', then it is possible that `Einstein's objective elements of physical reality' may exist, but that they are not probed by measurements that are subjected to the`physical restrictions singling out the domain of application of quantum mechanics' (analogous to the way the `atomic constitution of a billiard ball' is not probed by measurements that do not surpass the accuracy sufficient for probing the `classical theory of rigid bodies').\nThe correspondence principles\nDifferent forms of the `correspondence principle'\nWe should distinguish four different notions of `correspondence', belonging to different phases in the development of quantum physics, three of which being characteristic of the historical development of the `Copenhagen interpretation'. The fourth is presented here as a tribute to that interpretation.\ni) correspondence in the Old quantum theory 0 , which is a (heuristic) `methodological principle of theory development', applied during the developing stages of quantum physics preceding the conception of `quantum mechanics' (i.e before 1925) 38 ; it implies that in dealing with quantized systems classical relations are preserved as much as possible, satisfaction of the principle being seen as an indication of a successful development of the `quantum theory' as a ``rational generalization of the classical theories'';\nii) weak form of the correspondence principle , implying the expectation that if (fully developed) quantum mechanics is applied to larger and larger objects the quantum mechanical description finally will coincide with that of classical mechanics; it coincides with the belief that classical mechanics is the `classical limit of quantum mechanics (often simulated by taking the limit h \u2192 0)'; in most textbooks of quantum mechanics this is the only form of the `correspondence principle' that is referred to;\niii) strong form of the correspondence principle 4 , dealing with a characterization of the notion of a `quantum mechanical observable', to the effect that\na) a `measurement of a quantum mechanical observable' is supposed to establish a correspondence between that `quantum mechanical observable' and a `classical quantity';\nb) a `quantum mechanical observable' is exclusively defined (i.e. given empirical content) `within the context of the measurement serving to measure that observable'; thus, it does not make sense to talk about the position of a microscopic object if this quantity is not actually measured (this is the epistemological counterpart of Jordan 's ontological assertion);\nc) the definition of an observable may be less than perfect, the observable possibly being defined up to a certain latitude depending on the measurement arrangement;\nthis is the form of the correspondence principle Bohr finally arrived at, applied by him in a number of thought experiments and in his discussion with Einstein on the `completeness of quantum mechanics'.\nA common feature of these three forms of `correspondence' is their reliance on the connection between the microscopic world (requiring a new theory for its description) and the macroscopic world (described by classical mechanics). For this reason the relation between quantum and classical mechanics has played an important role ever since quantum mechanics had been conceived. In particular, the `classical limit of quantum mechanics' has been playing an important role in form ii), which even today is widely considered as the generic form of the `correspondence principle'.\nIt should be noted, however, that the importance of this aspect of the `correspondence principle' has been overestimated. As a methodological principle the `relation of quantum mechanics with reality' should be considered to be more important than its correspondence with `classical mechanics'. Indeed, form iii) already shows some awareness of this by stressing the importance of the `correspondence between quantum mechanics and the physical measurement arrangement' even though sticking to the `requirement of a correspondence with classical mechanics'. In Bohr's correspondence philosophy a gradual change can be observed in which the emphasis is switching from the `relation with classical mechanics' to the `relation with the measurement arrangement'.\ni) Correspondence in the Old quantum theory:\nThe development of the Bohr model of the atom 0 is an early example of the application of `correspondence' arguments. It is found that frequencies of electromagnetic transitions between highly excited Rydberg states 0 calculated on the basis of Bohr's `quantum conditions' coincide with values found classically.\nNote, however, that for acceptance of `Bohr's model of the atom' as a useful tool for studying atomic spectra its `agreement with experimental data like the Balmer series' has been much more important than the above-mentioned correspondence, even though for less excited states these experimental data were in disagreement with classical theory.\nNote that the `correspondence approach in the Old quantum theory' has given rise to the Bohr-Kramers-Slater (BKS) theory 0 which turned out to be in disagreement with experiment, and therefore was a blind alley in the development of quantum physics.\nOn the other hand, `correspondence' has played an important role in Kramers's attempts at calculating the intensities of transitions between states of the Bohr atom 36 . Also has Heisenberg's collaboration with Kramers on the basis of the `correspondence' approach had a considerable influence on the former's ability to guess the `matrix approach' finally yielding `quantum mechanics'. In this sense `quantum theory on the basis of correspondence' may be seen as a useful step in the `development of quantum mechanics'.\nii) Weak form of the correspondence principle:\nThe weak form of the correspondence principle should be distinguished from `correspondence in the Old quantum theory' because the `classical limit of quantum mechanics' is a property of `quantum mechanics', and, hence, could not have had any relevance as long as that theory was not yet sufficiently developed.\nA relation with the `classical limit of quantum mechanics' is induced by the measurement process necessarily amplifying microscopic information to the macroscopic domain, hence summoning an account of measurement in terms of classical concepts (at least on the macroscopic side of the Heisenberg cut ). Therefore the existence could be assumed of a `correspondence between quantum mechanical observables and classical quantities' in the sense that in the limit h \u2192 0 quantum mechanical observable A reduces to a (corresponding) classical quantity\nA(q,p). Inversely, starting from the classical quantity it was sometimes possible to guess which quantum mechanical observable should be taken as its counterpart (so-called quantization procedure ). In doing so the assumption, often attributed to Dirac, that in this limit the commutator of two observables A and B reduces to the Poisson bracket 0 of the corresponding classical quantities,\n\u2212i [ A, B] \u2212 \u2192 {A(q,p), B(q,p)},\nis not an implausible one (compare the example of position and momentum observables given here ). Hence, as a heuristic tool for developing the theory of quantum mechanics the `weak correspondence principle' has been rather fruitful. Note, however, that as a result of its non-uniqueness this quantization procedure cannot be conceived as a `derivation of quantum mechanics'.\nThe existence of a correspondence of this kind is also suggested, for instance, by Ehrenfest's theorem 0 as well as by the practical applicability of a (semi-)classical description to certain objects (like the `electromagnetic field'). However, it turns out to be rather unfruitful to demand a general existence of such a limit, the general structure of the `set of quantum mechanical observables' being fundamentally different from the structure of the `set of classical quantities'. The `classical limit' may be valid as `applicability of a (semi-)classical description in special cases', it does not make sense as a general requirement: for instance, the quantum mechanical `spin observable' does not have a classical limit. For these reasons as a methodological principle the `weak form of the correspondence principle' has drawbacks similar to those of `correspondence in the Old quantum theory'.\nIt should also be noted that a comparison of `quantum mechanics' and `classical mechanics' as suggested by the `Ehrenfest theorem' is obsolete since the state vector does not refer to an `individual particle' but to an ensemble . This implies that the `classical limit', too, should refer to an ensemble. Hence, if there is a `classical limit' at all, then not `classical mechanics' but `classical statistical mechanics' should be that limit.\niii) Strong form of the correspondence principle :\nThe Copenhagen `correspondence principle' has Bohr as its main architect, who in the revolutionary times he lived in, was forced to rebuild the `correspondence house' several times, the `strong form' being one of his masterpieces of architecture. During the years quantum theory was being developed Bohr's concern was with the strange properties of its quantities. Note that while contemplating microscopic physics Bohr always had in mind a classical ontology ( ``There is no quantum world'' ). `Classical mechanics' was Bohr's reference as long as quantum mechanics was not yet a fully developed theory, and even longer than that. Bohr usually talked about `physical quantities' rather than `observables' 68 (the quantum mechanical wave function being interpreted by him in an instrumentalist way). As a result his discussions remained in terms of `classical quantities', assumed to have the same ontological status as in `classical physics', be it restricted by `quantum conditions'. In the `strong correspondence principle' these restrictions are thought to be `imposed by the presence of the measuring instrument'. According to Bohr a `physical quantity' can be well-defined by its `correspondence with a classical quantity' only within the context of the measurement arrangement set up to measure that quantity. Implementing this into the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics this gives rise to application of the contextualistic-realist interpretation at least to `quantum mechanical observables'. It seems reasonable to attribute to attribute such an interpretation to Bohr notwithstanding his cautious attitude with respect to ontological assertions.\nCompared to earlier versions the notion of `correspondence' changed in several ways. Thus, `strong correspondence'\n\u03b1) does not rely on the `classical limit of quantum mechanics' since it is not required that on the macroscopic side of the Heisenberg cut there is a quantum mechanical description next to the classical one (even though it is widely, though unnecessarily, being assumed that such a description is possible, its classical limit allegedly yielding the classical description required by Bohr);\n\u03b2) is stressing the `importance of the experimental arrangement' in establishing the physical meaning of a `quantum mechanical observable', thus transcending the ( alleged ) `objectivity of classical quantities' by pointing to the ` contextuality of the notion of a quantum mechanical observable'; this has become a hallmark of the Copenhagen interpretation;\n\u03b3) is pointing to the difference between `quantum mechanics' and `classical mechanics' rather than to their similarity, the difference being established by the notion of ` incompatibility of quantum mechanical observables'.\nRemarks on `strong correspondence':\nBy the quantization conditions of `strong correspondence' a relation is established between a `quantum mechanical observable' and the `measurement arrangement used for its measurement'. Such a relation could only be conceived on the basis of the insight that observables may be defined differently if measurement arrangements are different, as is, for instance, the case of incompatible standard observables that are defined by mutually exclusive measurement arrangements (note that this example explains why `strong correspondence' is often presented as a part of `complementarity', compare footnote 4 ).\nDue to its apparent operationalism 0 the `strong correspondence principle' has been one reason (next to Heisenberg's self-professed empiricism ) to qualify the Copenhagen interpretation as a logical positivist/empiricist philosophy. However, this certainly does not apply to Bohr. It must have been Bohr's classical way of thinking about `physical quantities/observables' which induced him to deny that he would endorse logical positivism/empiricism. Even when talking about a quantum phenomenon Bohr had in mind an `object having classically-realist properties'. This implies that with Bohr, like in classical mechanics, a physical quantity (observable) of a microscopic object should be considered as a `property of that object', the `restriction on the possibility of simultaneous definition of incompatible quantities', involved in complementarity , thought to be the main difference between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics.\nWith Bohr observables are not interpreted in an empiricist sense, but rather in a realist one, be it in a `contextual sense, determined by the measurement arrangement'. This is particularly evident from Bohr's neglect of the difference between the measurement arrangements of EPR and EPR-Bell experiments , in the EPR experiment pointer readings being available only for one of the particles of an EPR pair. Physical quantities of microscopic objects are not defined in terms of the `directly observable quantities of measuring instruments' but are thought to have an existence of their own. In discussions of the `thought experiments' ample use was made of classical properties like `classical momentum conservation' and `classical wave diffraction', being thought to contextually define properties of the microscopic object, without bothering too much about whether the process under consideration is on the directly observational side of the Heisenberg cut or not.\nThe importance of the development of the notion of `correspondence' from `weak correspondence' to `strong correspondence' can hardly be overestimated since it shifted the attention from a methodology associated with the `classical limit' (having limited applicability) to a methodological principle being generally valid for arbitrary `quantum mechanical states' and `quantum mechanical observables' (both standard and generalized ones), liable to be operationally 39 implemented by devising suitable preparation and measurement procedures (yielding as measurement results the quantum mechanical probabilities pm of standard and generalized observables).\nHowever, an important step had still to be made, in which the relation between a `quantum mechanical observable' and its `measurement arrangement' is implemented into the mathematical formalism. This step will lead to a fourth phase in the development of the `correspondence principle', presented here .\nLatitude of definition of an observable (physical quantity)\nWith Bohr the definition of an observable (physical quantity) A need not be a sharp one (represented by a number), but may have a certain latitude \u03b4A (e.g. represented by an interval between two marks on a ruler) 89 . According to Bohr it in general does not make sense to think about an observable (physical quantity) as being more accurately defined than through such an interval; hence not: `the particle has a sharp although unknown position Q somewhere within the interval \u03b4Q', but: `the notion of position Q is itself unsharply defined'. The notion of `latitude' fits into the individual-particle interpretation since it is meant to represent a property of an individual microscopic object.\nEven though standard deviations \u0394A (as used in the Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality ) are properties of ensembles (viz. of distributions of sharp measurement results am), they have in discussions of the `thought experiments' often been assumed to represent latitudes \u03b4A (see e.g. Publ. 52 , section 4.5). In a probabilistic interpretation this does not seem to be an unnatural thing to do. Yet, by merging different notions into a single concept it is easily overlooked that `Bohr's latitudes \u03b4A' and `standard deviations \u0394A' may play very different roles in quantum mechanics: for instance, the distance between two marks on a ruler has nothing to do with the statistical spreading of measurement results. Such differences become evident within the empiricist interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nThe confusion as a result of not sufficiently distinguishing `latitudes \u03b4A' and `standard deviations \u0394A' has given rise to a criticism of the notion of complementarity , to be illustrated here (for a more extensive discussion, see Publ. 48 ).\nA `latitude' may be completely defined by the `calibration of the measuring instrument', and therefore may be a property of the measuring instrument rather than of the microscopic object. As follows from Bohr's reference to `definition of an observable', its meaning is epistemological with respect to the microscopic object ( compare ).\nStrictly speaking Bohr's notion of `latitude' need not be related to irreducible indeterminism , even though its origin is with the quantum postulate . `Latitude' is also referred to as `uncertainty', which notion, however, contrary to Bohr's intention, is often interpreted as `uncertainty about the sharp value allegedly possessed by the observable'. It is also often referred to as `indeterminacy' or `indeterminateness', which is confusing as a consequence of its suggestion of ontological indeterminism .\nCriticisms and appraisal of `strong correspondence'\nReliance of `strong correspondence' on `classical mechanics'\nAlthough, by no longer relying on the `classical limit of quantum mechanics', the `strong form of the correspondence principle' differs from its weak form, it still relies on `classical mechanics' by stressing the macroscopic character of a ` quantum phenomenon representing a measurement result of an observable'. For Bohr this was an essential aspect of `measurement within the microscopic domain' because `classical language' was thought to be necessary for `unambiguous communication between observers'.\nThis being acknowledged, at the same time it may be put into question whether the `correspondence between a quantum phenomenon and the human experimenter/observer' is really the crucial factor in determining the physical meaning of a `quantum mechanical observable', the human experimenter/observer being screened off from the microscopic world by the macroscopic interfaces of his instruments, and, hence, being dispensable .\nBy stressing in the notion of `correspondence' the essential role of the `measurement arrangement' rather than that of the `human experimenter/observer' Bohr changed the attention from the `relation between the microscopic object and the human observer' to the `relation between the microscopic object and the measuring instrument', thus taking a step into the direction of the empiricist interpretation in which the observer does not play an explicit role, and the measurement process is supposed to be an ordinary physical process , to be described by quantum mechanics.\nHowever, at that time this latter insight seems to have been `one bridge too far'. Probably due to a preoccupation with the `role of classical mechanics', nourished by the applicability of (parts of) that theory to the measurements available at that time (mainly limited to scattering experiments allowing unexpected applicability 0 of the `classical law of conservation of momentum' also within quantum physics), it could be thought that the measurement interaction might be treated classically.\nMoreover, the `strong correspondence principle' seemed itself to frustrate a quantum mechanical treatment of measurement, because a requirement of an `actual presence of a measurement arrangement for each of the multitudinous microscopic constituents of a macroscopic measuring instrument' would prevent an adequate operation of that instrument.\nHowever, we now believe that these arguments are not valid because we are convinced that `quantum measurement is an essentially microscopic process, at least in the pre-measurement phase to be described by quantum mechanics', it being determined during that very phase `which observable is measured by the measuring instrument' (compare the quantum mechanical characterization of a POVM given here ).\nFailure of `Bohr's thesis of classical description of measurement', inherent in the `strong correspondence principle', is the main cause of the present obsoleteness of the `Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics'. A quantum mechanical treatment of `measurement within the quantum domain' has turned out to be indispensable both from a physical point of view as well as from a philosophical one. `Correspondence with classical quantities' is not required, and sometimes even impossible (e.g. spin).\nNowadays, as a result of the widespread idea (probably having a classical source, too) that quantum mechanics should yield an objective description of nature, the contextuality going with issue b) of the strong form of correspondence is often not sufficiently appreciated. I think that Bohr was justified in stressing the `influence of measurement' in defining quantum mechanical quantities, because simply `all our knowledge on microscopic reality is mediated by measuring instruments processing information so as to make it fit to be observed on a macroscopic scale'. In agreement with his cautious attitude it was not unreasonable for Bohr to consider quantum mechanics as a description of a contextual reality, co-determined by the measurement arrangement actually present. Unfortunately, Bohr did not sufficiently appreciate the `dynamical role of measuring instruments, being evident from the quantum mechanical description of pre-measurement '.\n`Strong correspondence' without `reliance on classical mechanics'\nIt is important to note here that Heisenberg's approach does not rely on `classical mechanics'. In agreement with his more mathematical attitude he soon applied quantum mechanics to the measurement process, for the scattering experiments of his days arriving at the notion of measurement as formalized by von Neumann . However, although Heisenberg and von Neumann did not share Bohr's preoccupation with classical mechanics , by substituting the `quantum mechanical wave function' for the `phase space point of classical mechanics' they yet retained within their `interpretation of quantum mechanics' the ` realism of the usual interpretation of classical mechanics' (be it in the sense of a realist individual-particle interpretation endorsing ontological probability ).\nIn agreement with Feyerabend's observation , Heisenberg and von Neumann, even though already in an early stage revolting against Bohr's authority, are yet considered (co-)founders of the `Copenhagen interpretation', their mathematical/physical approach not being felt as opposing Bohr's philosophical/physical one ( compare ): a `realist individual-particle interpretation' in which a microscopic particle was viewed upon as a `wave packet flying around in space' just seemed to be \"equally physical\" as a `classical object' (even though the wave packet had to be interpreted as a probability wave). Contextuality of the definition of a standard observable could be taken into account both mathematically and physically by assuming that the measurement arrangement actually present would dictate which mathematical representation `has actual physical reality within the context of a measurement'. Thus, in an `interference experiment' the object would (in a realist interpretation) \"be a wave\", or (in Bohr's instrumentalist interpretation) \"manifest itself as a wave\"; in a `which-way experiment' it would \"be a particle\" c.q. \"manifest itself as such\".\nDuring a long time the idea of an `individual microscopic object' as a `wave packet flying around in space' could be upheld due to experimental inability to observe `detection of an individual object'. Only when it became possible to do so it became evident that the quantum mechanical wave function does not describe an individual object, but an ensemble . Unfortunately, even today this has not sufficiently been taken up by textbooks of quantum mechanics, thus perpetuating the influence of classical thinking within the domain of quantum mechanics.\nBeing `more quantum mechanical', the Heisenberg/von Neumann approach of quantum measurement might seem to be superior to Bohr's classical one. This is not necessarily true, though. As a matter of fact, reliance on von Neumann projection tended to ignore what is really going on in a quantum measurement 40 . In particular, `von Neumann projection' does not refer to the measuring instrument as playing any dynamical role in establishing a value of the measured observable. When reading the Copenhagen literature one gets the impression that the measuring instrument is there in the first place to `disturb observables incompatible with the measured one' rather than to `determine the value of the measured observable'. Thus, in measurements like the Stern-Gerlach one it is seldom noted that a measurement is completed only when it is ascertained `which of the outgoing beams the particle is in' (which is realized, for instance, by placing detectors in the beams, one of these to be triggered by the particle, thus realizing a `final pointer position').\nIn general, however, in the Copenhagen interpretation there is no reference to a process establishing the transition between initial and final states of a pointer of the measuring instrument. Instead, quantum mechanical measurement result am is associated with a transition to the final state |am> of the microscopic object. This characterizes the Copenhagen interpretation as a realist interpretation , be it of a contextualistic blend (a contextuality which, however, under the influence of the classical paradigm has disappeared from most textbooks of quantum mechanics in favour of a presentation in terms of an objectivistic-realist interpretation).\niv) Empiricist form of the correspondence principle\nTaking into account these criticisms of the `strong correspondence principle' it is straightforward to arrive at the ` empiricist interpretation of quantum mechanics' by dropping the requirement of `correspondence with classical mechanics', and by reinforcing Bohr's requirement of `correspondence with the measurement arrangement' so as to take into account in a dynamical way the `interaction between microscopic object and measuring instrument' (thus actually changing `correspondence with a measurement arrangement' into `correspondence with a measurement procedure').\nSuch a form of `correspondence' might be referred to as an empiricist form of the correspondence principle, being part of the `neo-Copenhagen interpretation' developed in Publ. 52 and Publ. 53 (compare the sketch of this interpretation given here ).\nIt should be noted that we have reached here a crucial point in the development of the notion of `correspondence', viz. a transition from a notion of `correspondence between theories' (viz. `quantum mechanics' and `classical mechanics') to `correspondence between theory (i.c. quantum mechanics) and reality'. The latter notion is in agreement with the notion of `interpretation' as used here 43 as well as with the notion of `correspondence' as applied in the so-called ` correspondence rules 0 attributing physical meaning to theoretical terms of a physical theory'. In a way the development towards `empiricist correspondence' completes the development of Bohr's thinking about `correspondence' referred to here .\nIt should also be stressed that in the `empiricist form of the correspondence principle' the `measurement arrangement' is no longer specified by its macroscopic parts (as Bohr used to do), but it is realized that the correspondence between a `quantum mechanical observable' and its `measurement arrangement' is determined by the microscopic phase of the measurement (on the microscopic side of the Heisenberg cut ), that is, by the pre-measurement , and that the macroscopic phase, although important by making the measurement result empirically accessible, does not contribute to the essence of the correspondence. Consequently, `empiricist correspondence' is determined by the `quantum mechanical treatment of the interaction between microscopic object and measuring instrument', which, notwithstanding Bohr's objection, has turned out not only to be possible but to be even necessary.\nIn particular, the correspondence of measurement arrangements of generalized observables with their POVMs does not seem to be liable to `formulation in classical terms'. In the `empiricist form of the correspondence principle' Bohr's `reliance on classical mechanics', still being observed in `strong correspondence', has been abandoned.\nStrictly speaking the `empiricist form of the correspondence principle' does not belong to the `Copenhagen interpretation'. It is part of a `neo-Copenhagen interpretation' developed in Publ. 52 and Publ. 53 , a sketch of which is given here .\nComplementarity\n`Complementarity of preparation' versus 'complementarity of measurement'\nThe notion of `complementarity' deals with the `incompatibility of standard observables', preventing such observables from being simultaneously or jointly measured in an ideal way (i.e. yielding a sharp and unambiguous value for each of them). Like the notion of `correspondence' also the notion of `complementarity' has changed in the course of time. Neither was it exactly the same for different authors.\nIn all forms `complementarity' is a direct consequence of the `strong correspondence principle', combined with `mutual exclusiveness of measurement arrangements corresponding to incompatible standard observables ', frustrating the possibility of simultaneously obtaining sharp values (i.e. with non-zero latitudes /uncertainties) of incompatible observables.\nIn the standard formalism of quantum mechanics `complementarity' is usually represented by the Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality\n\u0394 A\u0394 B \u2265 \u00bd|<[ A, B] \u2212>|,\nequating standard deviation \u0394A with Bohr's latitude \u03b4A.\nHowever, this identification must be seen as a consequence of an unhappy coincidence of the `mathematical derivation of the Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality' and the `physical attempts to come to grips with quantum measurement by studying thought experiments '. It caused even the best physicists to jump to the conclusion that the former could only be the mathematical expression of the latter.\nOnly as late as 1970 doubts were raised on this issue in an important paper by Ballentine 57 , stressing that the `standard deviations figuring in the Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality' only depend on the initial state (i.e. the state obtaining before the measurement) of the microscopic object, and do not in any way depend on the `properties of the measurement which they purportedly should represent'. It was realized only recently (cf. Publ. 52 ) that an explanation of the shortsightedness leading to the view of `the Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality as a property of joint measurement of incompatible observables' may be found in the circumstance that the `standard formalism of quantum mechanics' is not capable of yielding a satisfactory description of `thought experiments' like the double-slit experiment , but that rather the generalized formalism is necessary for that purpose. By restricting oneself to the `standard formalism' it was overlooked that the notion of `complementarity' actually consists of two parts, viz.\ni) complementarity of preparation (expressed, for instance, by the Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality, which is derived from the `standard formalism'),\nii)complementarity of measurement (to be expressed, for instance, by the Martens inequality , which is derived from the `generalized formalism').\nAs a consequence of the confusion stemming from a general ignorance of this distinction it was possible that in his answer to EPR Bohr could convince the majority of physicists that Einstein's idea of `incompleteness of quantum mechanics' (based on an assumption of `complementarity of preparation') would be unacceptable because it would be in disagreement with Bohr's idea of `complementarity of measurement'.\nBohr's notion of `complementarity'\nBohr's form of `complementarity', too, has its origin in his ` preoccupation with classical mechanics when considering the issues of completeness of quantum mechanics and correspondence '. When dealing with `incompatibility of quantum mechanical observables' Bohr stressed the `restricted applicability of classical mechanics', but at the same time he tried to save as much as possible the ideas of classical mechanics deemed necessary by him to describe `measurement phenomena'. From this point of view it seemed plausible to assume that the standard quantum mechanical observables of position (Q) and momentum (P) would take over the roles of classical position (q) and momentum (p). However, since Q and P are incompatible observables there should be differences.\nBohr's notion of `complementarity' consists of two ingredients:\ni) The `uncertainty principle' 52\nThe Copenhagen `uncertainty principle' has its origin in the incompatibility of position and momentum observables, and the ensuing impossibility of assigning to a microscopic object `simultaneous sharp values of position and momentum (i.e. having both latitudes of definition \u03b4Q and \u03b4P equal to zero)'. By studying so-called thought experiments Bohr found that the latitudes satisfy a relation of the type\n\u03b4 Q \u03b4 P \u2265 ch,\nh Planck's constant, and c some positive constant depending on the specific problem. Such an inequality is referred to as an uncertainty relation.\nUsually the Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality (with A = Q and B = P) is considered to be an implementation of the `uncertainty principle' into the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. However, this is subject to strong doubts ( compare ).\nii) Incompatible pictures supplementing each other 54\nEven though position Q and momentum P are incompatible and hence not measurable simultaneously, the combined information from separate measurements of these observables might be thought to yield a complete characterization of `what can be known about the state 44 of a microscopic object'. In this sense `complementarity' was seen by Bohr as a `rational generalization of the classical ideal of determinism', according to which the pair (q,p) is yielding a complete description of the state of a classical point particle. Within the atomic domain `determinism' (often referred to as `causality') was deemed to be necessarily replaced by `complementarity', thus providing room for `quantum mechanical indeterminism'. Note that this restricts `complementarity' to canonically conjugate observables satisfying `canonical commutation relations' of the type [Q, P]\u2212 = iI, having a `weak correspondence relation' with a classical Poisson bracket.\nRemarks on Bohr's notion of `complementarity'\n`Complementarity' and `completeness'\nAlthough initially for Bohr issue ii) may have been the most important one, it was soon realized that there cannot be any `completeness' in the sense that the `quantum mechanical state' (described by the wave function or state vector) would be completely determined by the probability distributions of position and momentum. 48\nA `dwindling influence of the classical paradigm ' has probably been the cause that issue ii) is usually not considered to be a constituent of the notion of `complementarity' any more, the `uncertainty principle' alone being considered as expressing its meaning. As a consequence the notion of `complementarity' has obtained a wider significance, no longer being restricted to ` canonically conjugate (maximally incompatible) observables (for which sharp knowledge of one is implying maximal uncertainty of the other)'. In the notion of `complementarity' the requirement of `maximality of the uncertainty' has been relinquished so as to consider as `complementary' any pair of observables that satisfy a nontrivial uncertainty relation (for which the constant c in its righthand side is greater than zero). This actually makes `complementary' any pair of standard observables corresponding to incompatible Hermitian operators.\n`Particle-wave duality' and `particle-wave complementarity'\nDuring the early stages of the development of quantum mechanics the idea has been developed (de Broglie) that a microscopic object has both particle-like and wave-like properties ( particle-wave duality 0 ). It seemed that the object (sometimes called a wavicle) can manifest itself either as a particle or as a wave.\nDuring some time this `particle-wave duality' has been considered paradigmatic for the notion of `complementarity'. Particle and wave pictures of the microscopic object were considered as mutually exclusive, but also as mutually completing each other ( compare ). In the context of a `position measurement' position Q was thought to be well-defined, allowing a particle picture of the quantum mechanical object (in which, however, the particle's momentum is completely undefined). Analogously, in a `momentum measurement' momentum P was thought to be well-defined. Then the corresponding wave function should be a plane wave. Hence, in the context of a momentum measurement the microscopic object would allegedly have to be pictured as a wave.\nThis application of `particle-wave duality' is referred to as `particle-wave complementarity'. Since `complementarity' is associated with `mutual exclusiveness of measurement arrangements', it was generally believed that in a `double-slit experiment' the interference pattern would be erased as soon as it is attempted to determine through which slit the particle or photon has passed. It was thought that in interference experiments (testing the wave character of the object) the particle picture would be inapplicable.\nCritique of `particle-wave complementarity'\nHowever, it was soon realized that `particle-wave duality' is not a sound application of `complementarity', since in an interference experiment both particle and wave aspects can be observed. Thus, whereas the interference pattern is described by the wave function, and hence is a consequence of the `wave aspect of quantum mechanics', is the `particle aspect' obvious within the same experiment when it is observed (see for instance Akira Tonomura, Double-slit experiment with single electrons, Video clip 1 ) how the interference pattern is built up by localized impacts on a screen. Experimental evidence is consistent with an ` ensemble interpretation of the quantum mechanical wave function', the localized impacts suggesting a `particle-like character of the individual objects' in `interference measurements' as well as in `which-way measurements'.\nUnfortunately, over the years `particle-wave complementarity' has been folk wisdom (even with Bohr), thus obscuring the inapplicability of the `Copenhagen individual-particle interpretation of the wave function'.\nThe idea of `wave-particle complementarity' has been able to come into being, and survive during such a long time, as a result of a restriction of experimental and theoretical attention to the standard formalism of quantum mechanics , being able to describe only measurements of standard observables like Q and P, interpreted as `which-way' and `interference' measurements, respectively (a `which-way measurement' being associated with `particle-like behaviour').\nHowever, this latter stereotyped idea cannot be maintained in the face of recently performed generalized measurements that can be interpreted as `joint nonideal measurements of interference and path observables' (e.g. Publ. 27 ), yielding information on both standard observables (be it, in agreement with the Martens inequality , subjected to a restriction of complementarity quite different from `particle-wave complementarity'). It is found that the pure `interference measurement' and `which-path measurement' are just two extremes of a whole sequence of `intermediate measurements' connecting the extremes by changing a parameter governing the measurement arrangement. Taking into account the `intermediate measurements' makes obsolete the polar view as endorsed in the idea of `particle-wave complementarity'. In particular, there is no experimental evidence of the validity of the often-heard assertion that interference would be completely wiped out as soon as an attempt is made at determining which way the particle is going (although the generalized treatment is revealing a more moderate influence of changing the parameter, entailing a continuous change of the probabilities pm when the measurement arrangement is gradually changed from one extreme to the other).\nHeisenberg's notion of `complementarity'\nHeisenberg's disturbance theory of measurement\nAccording to Heisenberg the meaning of `complementarity' is that measurements of incompatible observables like position Q and momentum P are mutually disturbing, to the effect that in a measurement `determining Q with uncertainty \u0394Q' momentum is `determined with uncertainty \u0394P', the standard deviations satisfying the same `uncertainty relation' as do Bohr's latitudes.\nLike in Bohr's notion of `complementarity' also `Heisenberg disturbance' is a consequence of `mutual exclusiveness of measurement arrangements', causing measurement results of incompatible standard observables to be influenced by the measurement arrangement that is actually present. Heisenberg's disturbance theory of measurement is mathematically implemented by von Neumann's projection postulate , prescribing a way the quantum mechanical state is influenced by a measurement. According to this convention a sharp measurement of Q (having \u0394Q = 0) must be accompanied by maximal uncertainty with respect to momentum (\u0394P = \u221e), and vice versa. 72\nMore generally, the standard deviations \u0394Q and \u0394P are often considered to be mathematical representations of Bohr's latitudes \u03b4Q and \u03b4P, both quantities possibly being finite. This identification of standard deviations and latitudes has been promoted by the idea that there must be a a close relation between the `uncertainty principle' and the Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality .\nAlthough `Heisenberg's disturbance theory of measurement' has turned out to be a realistic feature of `quantum measurement' ( compare ) is the above-mentioned relation subject to strong doubts ( compare ), and therefore is not assumed here.\nDifferences between Bohr and Heisenberg regarding the `uncertainty principle'\nA crucial difference between Bohr and Heisenberg is that Bohr's approach is epistemological ( compare ), whereas Heisenberg's is ontological/physical, `measurement disturbance' allegedly yielding a physical explanation of the indeterminacy expressed by Bohr's latitudes.\nWith Bohr the `uncertainty principle' refers to an `unanalyzed measurement phenomenon' representing the knowledge conveyed by a measurement, no distinction being made between different phases of that measurement. A `measurement result' is attributed to the `unanalyzed measurement phenomenon'.\nWith Heisenberg different phases of the measurement are distinguished. Consistent with `strong von Neumann projection' a measurement result is assumed to refer to the final state of the microscopic object. `Mutual exclusiveness of measurement arrangements' is manifest as a consequence of the impossibility that the final object state simultaneously be an eigenvector of both Q and P. This is in agreement with Heisenberg's contention that the `uncertainty relation' does not refer to the past (i.e. the initial state) but to the future (i.e. the final state).\nAlthough Heisenberg's approach is an improvement with respect to Bohr's one, it is, as a result of its `reliance on von Neumann's projection postulate' hardly more realistic than is Bohr's. A fundamental criticism of Heisenberg's approach of quantum measurement is given here .\nCritique of `Heisenberg's disturbance theory of measurement'\nHeisenberg's disturbance theory of measurement is based on the restrictive view of measurement symbolized in figure 3 , in which a measurement is tantamount to a `preparation of a final state of the microscopic object'. For such measurements Heisenberg's `preparative measurement disturbance' merges with the determinative notion of `disturbance of information on the initial state of the object, obtained by measurement'. In more general measurements preparative (predictive) aspects should be carefully distinguished from determinative (retrodictive) ones, thus giving rise to two different kinds of complementarity, one for `preparation', and one for `simultaneous measurement of incompatible observables' (see Publ. 48 ).\nRestriction to the `standard formalism' (according to which simultaneous measurement of incompatible observables is not even possible) has caused quite a bit of confusion with respect to the latter interpretation of `complementarity'. However, on the basis of the generalized formalism `Heisenberg disturbance' can be given an unambiguous determinative (retrodictive) meaning without having to rely on the special kind op `preparation of the microscopic object' symbolized in figure 3 (compare the Martens inequality ). The impossibility of a `simultaneous sharp definition of incompatible standard observables' can be interpreted as a `limitation on the simultaneous measurability of such observables' in a much more general way than envisaged by Heisenberg.\nAs noted by Ballentine 57 , as far as the `preparative feature of Heisenberg's disturbance theory of measurement' is related to `complementarity', it is `complementarity of preparation of the final state of the microscopic object' rather than `complementarity of observables measured in the initial state'. Here the same criticism applies as advanced with respect to `strong von Neumann projection': in general there is no reason to believe that the final state of the microscopic object is related to the measurement result that is obtained. As is clearly exhibited by the empiricist interpretation it is not the `final state of the microscopic object' that is relevant for the success of a measurement procedure, but it is the `final state of the pointer of the measuring instrument'. The microscopic object may be disturbed in any way consistent with the properties of the pre-measurement. Only in very special measurement procedures is it possible to interpret a `preparation of the microscopic object in a final state' as a `preparation of the pointer of a measuring instrument in a final pointer state' ( compare ).\nThis conclusion has important consequences for the interpretation of the Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality .\nCritique of `complementarity'\nThe identification of Bohr's `latitude \u03b4A', figuring in the strong correspondence principle , with the `standard deviation \u0394A of the Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality ' has been a considerable source of confusion.\nFirst, a latitude may correspond to a parameter of the measurement arrangement like, e.g. the slit width in a double-slit experiment. This parameter is independent of the properties of the incoming wave packet, which in a determinative approach is the interesting quantity. Instead, the parameter determines the standard deviations of the lateral position observable in the outgoing state |\u03c8m> of each slit (cf. figure 3 ), thus playing a preparative rather than a determinative role ( compare ).\nSecond, contrary to the idea of a latitude \u03b4A, in a standard deviation \u0394A every individual object is yielding a sharp measurement result.\nThird, the `Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality' is not in any obvious way related to the simultaneous measurement of the observables that are involved. On the contrary, the inequality can be tested by separate measurements of the observables (i.e. performed on different individual objects of an ensemble).\nIt is also important to note once again that Heisenberg and Bohr differed considerably in their understanding of the meaning of the `uncertainty relation'. Whereas with Bohr these are valid `within the context of the measurement (i.e. during the measurement)', with Heisenberg they are `referring to the future (i.e. after the measurement)'.\nBoth Bohr and Heisenberg differ from the textbook understanding in which the `Heisenberg-Kennard-Robertson inequality' is taken in the initial state, thus referring to the past (i.e. the state valid immediately before the measurement). In figure 12 the main differences are given between Bohr, Heisenberg and Ballentine 57 with respect to the way `measures of uncertainty/indeterminacy' are used (\u03b4A = latitude, \u0394A = standard deviation, determined either in the initial or final state of the measurement).\nfigure 12\n"}, {"score": 2402.5427, "uuid": "b60740e6-b1a3-5666-9e68-d0f05b3daf9e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0510wb-99-17444", "target_hostname": "www.illc.uva.nl", "target_uri": "http://www.illc.uva.nl/~seop/entries/qm-relational/", "page_rank": 1.1870865e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "Relational <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em> (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)", "snippet": "<em>The</em> <em>difference</em> derives from a very general interpretational <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> Everettian accounts <em>and</em> <em>the</em> relational point of view.

Introduction\nQuantum theory is our current general theory of physical motion. The theory is the core component of the momentous change that our understanding of the physical world has undergone during the first decades of the 20th century. It is one of the most successful scientific theories ever: it is supported by vast and unquestionable empirical and technological effectiveness and is today virtually unchallenged. But the interpretation of what the theory actually tells us about the physical world raises a lively debate, which has continued with alternating fortunes, from the early days of the theory in the late twenties, to nowadays. The relational interpretations are a number of reflections by different authors, which were independently developed, but converge in indicating an interpretation of the physical content of the theory. The core idea is to read the theory as a theoretical account of the way distinct physical systems affect each other when they interact (and not of the way physical systems \"are\"), and the idea that this account exhausts all that can be said about the physical world. The physical world is thus seen as a net of interacting components, where there is no meaning to the state of an isolated system. A physical system (or, more precisely, its contingent state) is reduced to the net of relations it entertains with the surrounding systems, and the physical structure of the world is identified as this net of relationships.\nThe possibility that the physical content of an empirically successful physical theory could be debated should not surprise: examples abound in the history of science. For instance, the great scientific revolution was fueled by the grand debate on whether the effectiveness of the Copernican system could be taken as an indication that the Earth was not in fact at the center of the universe. In more recent times, Einstein's celebrated first major theoretical success, special relativity, consisted to a large extent just in understanding the physical meaning (simultaneity is relative) of an already existing effective mathematical formalism (the Lorentz transformations). In these cases, as in the case of quantum mechanics, a very strictly empiricist position could have circumvented the problem altogether, by reducing the content of the theory to a list of predicted numbers. But perhaps science can offer us more than such a list; and certainly science needs more than such a list to find its ways.\nThe difficulty in the interpretation of quantum mechanics derives from the fact that the theory was first constructed for describing microscopic systems (atoms, electrons, photons) and the way these interact with macroscopic apparatuses built to measure their properties. Such interactions are denoted as \"measurements\". The theory consists in a mathematical formalism, which allows probabilities of alternative outcomes of such measurements to be calculated. If used just for this purpose, the theory raises no difficulty. But we expect the macroscopic apparatuses themselves \u2014 in fact, any physical system in the world \u2014 to obey quantum theory, and this seems to raise contradictions in the theory.\n1.1 The Problem\nIn classical mechanics, a system S is described by a certain number of physical variables. For instance, an electron is described by its position and its spin (intrinsic angular momentum). These variables change with time and represent the contingent properties of the system. We say that their values determine, at every moment, the \"state\" of the system. A measurement of a system's variable is an interaction between the system S and an external system O, whose effect on O, depends on the actual value q of the variable (of S) which is measured. The characteristic feature of quantum mechanics is that it does not allow us to assume that all variables of the system have determined values at every moment (this irrespectively of whether or not we know such values). It was Werner Heisenberg who first realized the need to free ourselves from the belief that, say, an electron has a well determined position at every time. When it is not interacting with an external system that can detect its position, the electron can be \"spread out\" over different positions. In the jargon of the theory, one says that the electron is in a \"quantum superposition\" of two (or many) different positions. It follows that the state of the system cannot be captured by giving the value of its variables. Instead, quantum theory introduces a new notion of \"state\" of a system, which is different from a list of values of its variables. Such a new notion of state was developed in the work of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in the form of the \"wave function\" of the system, usually denoted by \u03a8. Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac gave a general abstract formulation of the notion of quantum state, in terms of a vector \u03a8 moving in an abstract vector space. The time evolution of the state \u03a8 is deterministic and is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. From the knowledge of the state \u03a8, one can compute the probability of the different measurement outcomes q. That is, the probability of the different ways in which the system S can affect a system O in an interaction with it. The theory then prescribes that at every such \u2018measurement\u2019, one must update the value of \u03a8, to take into account which of the different outcomes has happened. This sudden change of the state \u03a8 depends on the specific outcome of the measurement and is therefore probabilistic. It is called the \"collapse of the wave function\".\nThe problem of the interpretation of quantum mechanics takes then different forms, depending on the relative ontological weight we choose to assign to the wave function \u03a8 or, respectively, to the sequence of the measurement outcomes q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026. If we take \u03a8 as the \"real\" entity which fully represents the actual state of affairs of the world, we encounter a number of difficulties. First, we have to understand how \u03a8 can change suddenly in the course of a measurement: if we describe the evolution of two interacting quantum systems in terms of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, no collapse happens. Furthermore, the collapse, seen as a physical process, seems to depend on arbitrary choices in our description and shows a disturbing amount of nonlocality. But even if we can circumvent the collapse problem, the more serious difficulty of this point of view is that it appears to be impossible to understand how specific observed values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 can emerge from the same \u03a8. A better alternative is to take the observed values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 as the actual elements of reality, and view \u03a8 just as a bookkeeping device, determined by the actual values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 that happened in past. From this perspective, the real events of the world are the \"realization\" (the \"coming to reality\", the \"actualization\") of the values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 in the course of the interaction between physical systems. This actualization of a variable q in the course of an interaction can be denoted as the quantum event q. An exemple of a quantum event is the detection of an electron in a certain position. The position variable of the electron assumes a determined value in the course of the interaction between the electron and an external system and the quantum event is the \"manifestation\" of the electron in a certain position. Quantum events have an intrinsically discrete (\"quantized\") granular structure.\nThe difficulty of this second option is that if we take the quantum nature of all physical systems into account, the statement that a certain specific event q \"has happened\" (or, equivalently that a certain variable has or has not taken the value q) can be true and not-true at the same time. To clarify this key point, consider the case in which a system S interacts with another system (an apparatus) O, and exhibits a value q of one of its variables. Assume that the system O obeys the laws of quantum theory as well, and use the quantum theory of the combined system formed by O and S in order to predict the way this combined system can later interact with a third system O\u2032. Then quantum mechanics forbids us to assume that q has happened. Indeed, as far as its later behavior is concerned, the combined system S+O may very well be in a quantum superposition of alternative possible values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026. This \"second observer\" situation captures the core conceptual difficulty of the interpretation of quantum mechanics: reconciling the possibility of quantum superposition with the fact that the observed world is characterized by uniquely determined events q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026. More precisely, it shows that we cannot disentangle the two: according to the theory an observed quantity (q) can be at the same time determined and not determined. An event may have happened and at the same time may not have happened.\n2. Relational view of quantum states\nThe way out from this dilemma suggested by the relational interpretations is that the quantum events, and thus the values of the variables of a physical system S, namely the q's, are relational. That is, they do not express properties of the system S alone, but rather refer to the relation between two systems.\nThe best developed of these interpretations is relational quantum mechanics (Rovelli 1996, 1997). For a detailed and critical account of this view of quantum theory, see (van Fraassen 2008) and (Bitbol 2007). The central tenet of relational quantum mechanics is that there is no meaning in saying that a certain quantum event has happened or that a variable of the system S has taken the value q: rather, there is meaning in saying that the event q has happened or the variable has taken the value q for O, or with respect to O. The apparent contradiction between the two statements that a variable has or hasn't a value is resolved by indexing the statements with the different systems with which the system in question interacts. If I observe an electron at a certain position, I cannot conclude that the electron is there: I can only conclude that the electron as seen by me is there. Quantum events only happen in interactions between systems, and the fact that a quantum event has happened is only true with respect to the systems involved in the interaction. The unique account of the state of the world of the classical theory is thus fractured into a multiplicity of accounts, one for each possible \"observing\" physical system. In the words of (Rovelli 1996): \"Quantum mechanics is a theory about the physical description of physical systems relative to other systems, and this is a complete description of the world\".\nThis relativisation of actuality is viable thanks to a remarkable property of the formalism of quantum mechanics. John von Neumann was the first to notice that the formalism of the theory treats the measured system (S ) and the measuring system (O) differently, but the theory is surprisingly flexible on the choice of where to put the boundary between the two. Different choices give different accounts of the state of the world (for instance, the collapse of the wave function happens at different times); but this does not affect the predictions on the final observations. Von Neumann only described a rather special situation, but this flexibility reflects a general structural property of quantum theory, which guarantees the consistency among all the distinct \"accounts of the world\" of the different observing systems. The manner in which this consistency is realized, however, is subtle.\nWhat appears with respect to O as a measurement of the variable q (with a specific outcome), appears with respect to O\u2032 simply as the establishing of a correlation between S and O (without any specific outcome). As far as the observer O is concerned, a quantum event has happened and a property q of a system S has taken a certain value. As far as the second observer O\u2032 is concerned, the only relevant element of reality is that a correlation is established between S and O. This correlation will manifest itself only in any further observation that O\u2032 would perform on the S+O system. Up to the time in which it physically interacts with S+O, the system O\u2032 has no access to the actual outcomes of the measurements performed by O on S . This actual outcome is real only with respect to O (Rovelli 1996, pp. 1650-52). Consider for instance a two-state system O (say, a light-emitting diode, or l.e.d., which can be on or off) interacting with a two-state system S (say, the spin of an electron, which can be up or down). Assume the interaction is such that if the spin is up (down) the l.e.d. goes on (off). To start with, the electron can be in a superposition of its two states. In the account of the state of the electron that we can associate with the l.e.d., a quantum event happens in the interaction, the wave function of the electron collapses to one of two states, and the l.e.d. is then either on or off. But we can also consider the l.e.d./electron composite system as a quantum system and study the interactions of this composite system with another system O\u2032. In the account associated to O\u2032, there is no event and no collapse at the time of the interaction, and the composite system is still in the superposition of the two states [spin up/l.e.d. on] and [spin down/l.e.d. off] after the interaction. It is necessary to assume this superposition because it accounts for measurable interference effects between the two states: if quantum mechanics is correct, these interference effects are truly observable by O\u2032. So, we have two discordant accounts of the same events. Can the two discord accounts be compared and does the comparison lead to contradiction? They can be compared, because the information on the first account is stored in the state of the l.e.d. and O\u2032 has access to this information. Therefore O and O\u2032 can compare their accounts of the state of the world.\nHowever, the comparison does not lead to contradiction because the comparison is itself a physical process that must be understood in the context of quantum mechanics. Indeed, O\u2032 can physically interact with the electron and then with the l.e.d. (or, equivalently, the other way around). If, for instance, he finds the spin of the electron up, quantum mechanics predicts that he will then consistently find the l.e.d. on (because in the first measurement the state of the composite system collapses on its [spin up/l.e.d. on] component). That is, the multiplicity of accounts leads to no contradiction precisely because the comparison between different accounts can only be a physical quantum interaction. This internal self-consistency of the quantum formalism is general, and it is perhaps its most remarkable aspect. This self consistency is taken in relational quantum mechanics as a strong indication of the relational nature of the world.\nIn fact, one may conjecture that this peculiar consistency between the observations of different observers is the missing ingredient for a reconstruction theorem of the Hilbert space formalism of quantum theory. Such a reconstruction theorem is still unavailable: On the basis of reasonable physical assumptions, one is able to derive the structure of an orthomodular lattice containing subsets that form Boolean algebras, which \"almost\", but not quite, implies the existence of a Hilbert space and its projectors' algebra (see the entry Quantum Logic and Quantum Probability.) Perhaps an appropriate algebraic formulation of the condition of consistency between subsystems could provide the missing hypothesis to complete the reconstruction theorem.\nBas van Fraassen has given an extensive critical discussion of this interpretation; he has also suggested an improvement, in the form of an additional postulate weakly relating the description of the same system given by different observers (van Fraassen 2008). Michel Bitbol has analyzed the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics from a Kantian perspective, substituting functional reference frames for physical (or naturalized) observers (Bitbol 2007).\n3. Correlations\nThe conceptual relevance of correlations in quantum mechanics, \u2014 a central aspect of relational quantum mechanics \u2014 is emphasized by David Mermin, who analyses the statistical features of correlation (Mermin 1998), and arrives at views close to the relational ones. Mermin points out that a theorem on correlations in Hilbert space quantum mechanics is relevant to the problem of what exactly quantum theory tells us about the physical world. Consider a quantum system S with internal parts s, s\u2032,\u2026, that may be considered as subsystems of S , and define the correlations among subsystems as the expectation values of products of subsystems' observables. It can be proved that, for any resolution of S into subsystems, the subsystems' correlations determine uniquely the state of S. According to Mermin, this theorem highlights two major lessons that quantum mechanics teaches us: first, the relevant physics of S is entirely contained in the correlations both among the s, s\u2032,\u2026, themselves (internal correlations) and among the s\u2032,\u2026, and other systems (external correlations); second, correlations may be ascribed physical reality whereas, according to well-known \u2018no-go\u2019 theorems, the quantities that are the terms of the correlations cannot (Mermin 1998).\n4. Self-reference and self-measurement\nFrom a relational point of view, the properties of a system exists only in reference to another system. What about the properties of a system with respect to itself? Can a system measure itself? Is there any meaning of the correlations of a system with itself? Implicit in the relational point of view is the intuition that a complete self-measurement is impossible. It is this impossibility that forces all properties to be referred to another system. The issue of the self-measurement has been analyzed in details in two remarkable works, from very different perspectives, but with similar conclusions, by Marisa Dalla Chiara and by Thomas Breuer.\n4.1 Logical aspect of the measurement problem\nMarisa Dalla Chiara (1977) has addressed the logical aspect of the measurement problem. She observes that the problem of self-measurement in quantum mechanics is strictly related to the self-reference problem, which has an old tradition in logic. From a logical point of view the measurement problem of quantum mechanics can be described as a characteristic question of \"semantical closure\" of a theory. To what extent can quantum mechanics apply consistently to the objects and the concepts in terms of which its metatheory is expressed? Dalla Chiara shows that the duality in the description of state evolution, encoded in the ordinary (i.e. von Neumann's) approach to the measurement problem, can be given a purely logical interpretation: \"If the apparatus observer O is an object of the theory, then O cannot realize the reduction of the wave function. This is possible only to another O\u2032, which is \u2018external\u2019 with respect to the universe of the theory. In other words, any apparatus, as a particular physical system, can be an object of the theory. Nevertheless, any apparatus which realizes the reduction of the wave function is necessarily only a metatheoretical object \" (Dalla Chiara 1977, p. 340). This observation is remarkably consistent with the way in which the state vector reduction is justified within the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics. When the system S+O is considered from the point of view of O\u2032, the measurement can be seen as an interaction whose dynamics is fully unitary, whereas by the point of view of O the measurement breaks the unitarity of the evolution of S. The unitary evolution does not break down through mysterious physical jumps, due to unknown effects, but simply because O is not giving a full dynamical description of the interaction. O cannot have a full description of the interaction of S with himself (O), because his information is correlation information and there is no meaning in being correlated with oneself. If we include the observer into the system, then the evolution is still unitary, but we are now dealing with the description of a different observer.\n4.2 Impossibility of complete self-measurement\nAs is well known, from a purely logical point of view self-reference properties in formal systems impose limitations on the descriptive power of the systems themselves. Thomas Breuer has shown that, from a physical point of view, this feature is expressed by the existence of limitations in the universal validity of physical theories, no matter whether classical or quantum (Breuer 1995). Breuer studies the possibility for an apparatus O to measure its own state. More precisely, of measuring the state of a system containing an apparatus O. He defines a map from the space of all sets of states of the apparatus to the space of all sets of states of the system. Such a map assigns to every set of apparatus states the set of system states that is compatible with the information that \u2014 after the measurement interaction \u2014 the apparatus is in one of these states. Under reasonable assumptions on this map, Breuer is able to prove a theorem stating that no such map can exist that can distinguish all the states of the system. An apparatus O cannot distinguish all the states of a system S containing O. This conclusion holds irrespective of the classical or quantum nature of the systems involved, but in the quantum context it implies that no quantum mechanical apparatus can measure all the quantum correlations between itself and an external system. These correlations are only measurable by a second external apparatus, observing both the system and the first apparatus.\n5.1 Quantum reference systems\nA relational view of quantum mechanics has been proposed also by Gyula Bene (1997). Bene argues that quantum states are relative in the sense that they express a relation between a system to be described and a different system, containing the former as a subsystem and acting for it as a quantum reference system (here the system is contained in the reference system, while in Breuer's work the system contains the apparatus). Consider again a measuring system (O) that has become entangled with a measured system (S ) during a measurement. Once again, the difficulty of quantum theory is that there is an apparent contradiction between the fact that the quantity q of the system assumes an observed value in the measurement, while the composite S+O system still has to be considered in a superposition state, if we want to properly predict the outcome of measurements on the S+O system. This apparent contradiction is resolved by Bene by relativizing the state not to an observer, as in the relational quantum mechanics sketched in Section 2, but rather to a relevant composite system. That is: there is a state of the system S relative to S alone, and a state of the system S relative to the S+O composite system. (Similarly, there is a state of the system O relative to itself alone, and a state of the system O relative to the S+O ensemble.) The ensemble with respect to which the state is defined is called by Bene the quantum reference system . The state of a system with respect to a given quantum reference system correctly predicts the probability distributions of any measurement on the entire reference system. This dependence of the states of quantum systems from different quantum systems that act as reference systems is viewed as a fundamental property that holds no matter whether a system is observed or not.\n5.2 Sigma algebra of interactive properties\nSimilar views have been expressed by Simon Kochen in unpublished but rather well-known notes (Kochen, 1979, preprint). In Kochen's words: \"The basic change in the classical framework which we advocate lies in dropping the assumption of the absoluteness of physical properties of interacting systems\u2026 Thus quantum mechanical properties acquire an interactive or relational character.\" Kochen uses a \u03c3-algebra formalism. Each quantum system has an associated Hilbert space. The properties of the system are established by its interaction with other quantum systems, and these properties are represented by the corresponding projection operators on the Hilbert space. These projectors are elements of a Boolean \u03c3-algebra, determined by the physics of the interaction between the two systems. Suppose a quantum system S can interact with quantum systems Q, Q\u2032,\u2026. In each case, S will acquire an interaction \u03c3-algebra of properties \u03c3(Q), \u03c3(Q\u2032) since the interaction between S and Q may be finer grained than the interaction between S and Q\u2032. Thus, interaction \u03c3-algebras may have non-trivial intersections. The family of all Boolean \u03c3-algebras forms a category, with the sets of the projectors of each \u03c3-algebra as objects. In Kochen's words: \"Just as the state of a composite system does not determine states of its components, conversely, the states of the\u2026 correlated systems do not determine the state of the composite system [\u2026] We thus resolve the measurement problem by cutting the Gordian knot tying the states of component systems uniquely to the state of the combined system.\" This is very similar in spirit to the Bene approach and to Rovelli's relational quantum mechanics, but the precise technical relation between the formalisms utilized in these approaches has not yet been analysed in full detail.\nFurther approaches at least formally related to Kochen's have been proposed by Healey (1989), who also emphasises an interactive aspect of his approach, and by Dieks (1989). See also the entry on \u2019Modal Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics\u2019.\n5.3 Quantum theory of the universe\nRelational views on quantum theory have been defended also by Lee Smolin (1995) and by Louis Crane (1995) in a cosmological context. If one is interested in the quantum theory of the entire universe, then, by definition, an external observer is not available. Breuer's theorem shows then that a quantum state of the universe, containing all correlations between all subsystems, expresses information that is not available, not even in principle, to any observer. In order to write a meaningful quantum state, argue Crane and Smolin, we have to divide the universe in two components and consider the relative quantum state predicting the outcomes of the observations that one component can make on the other.\n5.4 Relation with Everett's relative-state interpretation\nRelational ideas underlie also the interpretations of quantum theory inspired by the work of Everett. Everett\u2019 original work (Everett 1975) relies on the notion of \"relative state\" and has a marked relational tone (see quantum mechanics: Everett's relative-state formulation of ). In the context of Everettian accounts, a state may be taken as relative either (more commonly) to a \"world\", or \"branch\", or (sometimes) to the state of another system (see for instance Saunders 1996, 1998). While the first variant (relationalism with respect to branches) is far from the relational views described here, the second variant (relationalism with respect to the state of a system) is closer.\nHowever, it is different to say that something is relative to a system or that something is relative to a state of a system. Consider for instance the situation described in the example of Section 5: According to the relational interpretation, after the first measurement the quantity q has a given value and only one for O, while in Everettian terms the quantity q has a value for one state of O and a different value for another state of O, and the two are equally real. In Everett, there is an ontological multiplicity of realities, which is absent in the relational point of view, where physisical quantities are uniquely determined, once two systems are given.\nThe difference derives from a very general interpretational difference between Everettian accounts and the relational point of view. Everett (at least in its widespread version) takes the state \u03a8 as the basis of the ontology of quantum theory. The overall state \u03a8 includes different possible branches and different possible outcomes. On the other hand, the relational interpretation takes the quantum events q, that is, the actualizations of values of physical quantities, as the basic elements of reality (see Section 1.1 above) and such q's are assumed to be univocal. The relational view avoids the traditional difficulties in taking the q's as univocal simply by noticing that a q does not refer to a system, but rather to a pair of systems.\nFor a comparison between the relational interpretation and other current interpretations of quantum mechanics, see Rovelli 1996.\n6. Some consequences of the relational point of view\nA number of open conceptual issues in quantum mechanics appear in a different light when seen in the context of a relational interpretation of the theory. In particular, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations have a substantially different interpretation within the perspective of the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics. Laudisa (2001) has argued that the non-locality implied by the conventional EPR argument turns out to be frame-dependent, and this result supports the \"peaceful coexistence\" of quantum mechanics and special relativity. More radically, Rovelli and Smerlak (2006) argue that these correlations do not entail any form of \"non-locality\", when viewed in the context of this interpretation, essentially because there is a quantum event relative to an observer that happens at a spacelike separation from this observer. The abandonment of strict Einstein realism implied by the relational stance permits to reconcile quantum mechanics, completeness and locality.\nAlso, the relational interpretation allows one to give a precise definition of the time (or, better, the probability distribution of the time) at which a measurement happens, in terms of the probability distribution of the correlation between system and apparatus, as measurable by a third observer (Rovelli 1998).\nFinally, it has been suggested in (Rovelli 1997) that the relationalism at the core of quantum theory pointed out by the relational interpretations might be connected with the spatiotemporal relationalism that characterizes general relativity. Quantum mechanical relationalism is the observation that there are no absolute properties: properties of a system S are relative to another system O with which S is interacting. General relativistic relationalism is the well known observation that there is no absolute localization in spacetime: localization of an object S in spacetime is only relative to the gravitational field, or to any other object O, to which S is contiguous. There is a connection between the two, since interaction between S and O implies contiguity and contiguity between S and O can only be checked via some quantum interaction. However, because of the difficulty of developing a consistent and conceptually transparent theory of quantum gravity, so far this suggestion has not been developed beyond the stage of a simple intuition.\n7. Conclusion\nRelational interpretations of quantum mechanics propose a solution to the interpretational difficulties of quantum theory based on the idea of weakening the notions of the state of a system, event, and the idea that a system, at a certain time, may just have a certain property. The world is described as an ensemble of events (\"the electron is the point x\") which happen only relatively to a given observer. Accordingly, the state and the properties of a system are relative to another system only. There is a wide diversity in style, emphasis, and language in the authors that we have mentioned. Indeed, most of the works mentioned have developed independently from each other. But it is rather clear that there is a common idea underlying all these approaches, and the convergence is remarkable.\nWerner Heisenberg first recognized that the electron does not have a well defined position when it is not interacting. Relational interpretations push this intuition further, by stating that, even when interacting, the position of the electron is only determined in relation to a certain observer, or to a certain quantum reference system, or similar.\nIn physics, the move of deepening our insight into the physical world by relativizing notions previously used as absolute has been applied repeatedly and very successfully. Here are a few examples. The notion of the velocity of an object has been recognized as meaningless, unless it is indexed with a reference body with respect to which the object is moving. With special relativity, simultaneity of two distant events has been recognized as meaningless, unless referred to a specific state of motion of something. (This something is usually denoted as \"the observer\" without, of course, any implication that the observer is human or has any other peculiar property besides having a state of motion. Similarly, the \"observer system\" O in quantum mechanics need not to be human or have any other property beside the possibility of interacting with the \"observed\" system S.) With general relativity, the position in space and time of an object has been recognized as meaningless, unless it is referred to the gravitational field, or to some other dynamical physical entity. The move proposed by the relational interpretations of quantum mechanics has strong analogies with these, but is, in a sense, a longer jump, since all physical events and the entirety of the contingent properties of any physical system are taken to be meaningful only as relative to a second physical system. The claim of the relational interpretations is that this is not an arbitrary move. Rather, it is a conclusion which is difficult to escape, following from the observation \u2014 explained above in the example of the \"second observer\" \u2014 that a variable (of a system S) can have a well determined value q for one observer (O) and at the same time fail to have a determined value for another observer (O\u2032).\nThis way of thinking the world has certainly heavy philosophical implications. The claim of the relational interpretations is that it is nature itself that is forcing us to this way of thinking. If we want to understand nature, our task is not to frame nature into our philosophical prejudices, but rather to learn how to adjust our philosophical prejudices to what we learn from nature.\nBene, G., 1992, \"Quantum reference systems: a new framework for quantum mechanics\", Physica, A242: 529-560.\nBreuer, T., 1993, \"The impossibility of accurate state self-measurements\", Philosophy of Science, 62: 197-214.\nCrane, L., 1993, \"Clock and Category: Is Quantum Gravity Algebraic?\", Journal of Mathematical Physics, 36: 6180-6193.\nDalla Chiara, M.L., 1977, \"Logical self-reference, set theoretical paradoxes and the measurement problem in quantum mechanics\", Journal of Philosophical Logic, 6: 331-347.\nEverett H., 1957, \"\u2018Relative State\u2019 Formulation of Quantum Mechanics,\" Reviews of Modern Physics, 29: 454-462.\nDieks, D., 1989, \"Resolution of the Measurement Problem through Decoherence of the Quantum State\", Physics letters, A142: 439-446.\nHealey, R., 1989, The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics: An Interactive Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\nKochen, S., 1979, \"The interpretation of quantum mechanics\", Princeton: Princeton University Preprint.\nLaudisa, F., 2001, \"The EPR Argument in a Relational Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics\", Foundations of Physics Letters, 14: 119-132.\nMermin, N.D., 1998, \"What is quantum mechanics trying to tell us?\", American Journal of Physics, 66: 753-767.\nRovelli, C., 1996, \"Relational quantum mechanics\", International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 35: 1637-1678.\nRovelli, C., 1997, \"Half way through the woods\", in J.

Introduction\nQuantum theory is our current general theory of physical motion. The theory is the core component of the momentous change that our understanding of the physical world has undergone during the first decades of the 20th century. It is one of the most successful scientific theories ever: it is supported by vast and unquestionable empirical and technological effectiveness and is today virtually unchallenged. But the interpretation of what the theory actually tells us about the physical world raises a lively debate, which has continued with alternating fortunes, from the early days of the theory in the late twenties, to nowadays. The relational interpretations are a number of reflections by different authors, which were independently developed, but converge in indicating an interpretation of the physical content of the theory. The core idea is to read the theory as a theoretical account of the way distinct physical systems affect each other when they interact (and not of the way physical systems \"are\"), and the idea that this account exhausts all that can be said about the physical world. The physical world is thus seen as a net of interacting components, where there is no meaning to the state of an isolated system. A physical system (or, more precisely, its contingent state) is reduced to the net of relations it entertains with the surrounding systems, and the physical structure of the world is identified as this net of relationships.\nThe possibility that the physical content of an empirically successful physical theory could be debated should not surprise: examples abound in the history of science. For instance, the great scientific revolution was fueled by the grand debate on whether the effectiveness of the Copernican system could be taken as an indication that the Earth was not in fact at the center of the universe. In more recent times, Einstein's celebrated first major theoretical success, special relativity, consisted to a large extent just in understanding the physical meaning (simultaneity is relative) of an already existing effective mathematical formalism (the Lorentz transformations). In these cases, as in the case of quantum mechanics, a very strictly empiricist position could have circumvented the problem altogether, by reducing the content of the theory to a list of predicted numbers. But perhaps science can offer us more than such a list; and certainly science needs more than such a list to find its ways.\nThe difficulty in the interpretation of quantum mechanics derives from the fact that the theory was first constructed for describing microscopic systems (atoms, electrons, photons) and the way these interact with macroscopic apparatuses built to measure their properties. Such interactions are denoted as \"measurements\". The theory consists in a mathematical formalism, which allows probabilities of alternative outcomes of such measurements to be calculated. If used just for this purpose, the theory raises no difficulty. But we expect the macroscopic apparatuses themselves \u2014 in fact, any physical system in the world \u2014 to obey quantum theory, and this seems to raise contradictions in the theory.\n1.1 The Problem\nIn classical mechanics, a system S is described by a certain number of physical variables. For instance, an electron is described by its position and its spin (intrinsic angular momentum). These variables change with time and represent the contingent properties of the system. We say that their values determine, at every moment, the \"state\" of the system. A measurement of a system's variable is an interaction between the system S and an external system O, whose effect on O, depends on the actual value q of the variable (of S) which is measured. The characteristic feature of quantum mechanics is that it does not allow us to assume that all variables of the system have determined values at every moment (this irrespectively of whether or not we know such values). It was Werner Heisenberg who first realized the need to free ourselves from the belief that, say, an electron has a well determined position at every time. When it is not interacting with an external system that can detect its position, the electron can be \"spread out\" over different positions. In the jargon of the theory, one says that the electron is in a \"quantum superposition\" of two (or many) different positions. It follows that the state of the system cannot be captured by giving the value of its variables. Instead, quantum theory introduces a new notion of \"state\" of a system, which is different from a list of values of its variables. Such a new notion of state was developed in the work of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in the form of the \"wave function\" of the system, usually denoted by \u03a8. Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac gave a general abstract formulation of the notion of quantum state, in terms of a vector \u03a8 moving in an abstract vector space. The time evolution of the state \u03a8 is deterministic and is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. From the knowledge of the state \u03a8, one can compute the probability of the different measurement outcomes q. That is, the probability of the different ways in which the system S can affect a system O in an interaction with it. The theory then prescribes that at every such \u2018measurement\u2019, one must update the value of \u03a8, to take into account which of the different outcomes has happened. This sudden change of the state \u03a8 depends on the specific outcome of the measurement and is therefore probabilistic. It is called the \"collapse of the wave function\".\nThe problem of the interpretation of quantum mechanics takes then different forms, depending on the relative ontological weight we choose to assign to the wave function \u03a8 or, respectively, to the sequence of the measurement outcomes q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026. If we take \u03a8 as the \"real\" entity which fully represents the actual state of affairs of the world, we encounter a number of difficulties. First, we have to understand how \u03a8 can change suddenly in the course of a measurement: if we describe the evolution of two interacting quantum systems in terms of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, no collapse happens. Furthermore, the collapse, seen as a physical process, seems to depend on arbitrary choices in our description and shows a disturbing amount of nonlocality. But even if we can circumvent the collapse problem, the more serious difficulty of this point of view is that it appears to be impossible to understand how specific observed values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 can emerge from the same \u03a8. A better alternative is to take the observed values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 as the actual elements of reality, and view \u03a8 just as a bookkeeping device, determined by the actual values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 that happened in past. From this perspective, the real events of the world are the \"realization\" (the \"coming to reality\", the \"actualization\") of the values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 in the course of the interaction between physical systems. This actualization of a variable q in the course of an interaction can be denoted as the quantum event q. An exemple of a quantum event is the detection of an electron in a certain position. The position variable of the electron assumes a determined value in the course of the interaction between the electron and an external system and the quantum event is the \"manifestation\" of the electron in a certain position. Quantum events have an intrinsically discrete (\"quantized\") granular structure.\nThe difficulty of this second option is that if we take the quantum nature of all physical systems into account, the statement that a certain specific event q \"has happened\" (or, equivalently that a certain variable has or has not taken the value q) can be true and not-true at the same time. To clarify this key point, consider the case in which a system S interacts with another system (an apparatus) O, and exhibits a value q of one of its variables. Assume that the system O obeys the laws of quantum theory as well, and use the quantum theory of the combined system formed by O and S in order to predict the way this combined system can later interact with a third system O\u2032. Then quantum mechanics forbids us to assume that q has happened. Indeed, as far as its later behavior is concerned, the combined system S+O may very well be in a quantum superposition of alternative possible values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026. This \"second observer\" situation captures the core conceptual difficulty of the interpretation of quantum mechanics: reconciling the possibility of quantum superposition with the fact that the observed world is characterized by uniquely determined events q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026. More precisely, it shows that we cannot disentangle the two: according to the theory an observed quantity (q) can be at the same time determined and not determined. An event may have happened and at the same time may not have happened.\n2. Relational view of quantum states\nThe way out from this dilemma suggested by the relational interpretations is that the quantum events, and thus the values of the variables of a physical system S, namely the q's, are relational. That is, they do not express properties of the system S alone, but rather refer to the relation between two systems.\nThe best developed of these interpretations is relational quantum mechanics (Rovelli 1996, 1997). For a detailed and critical account of this view of quantum theory, see (van Fraassen 2008) and (Bitbol 2007). The central tenet of relational quantum mechanics is that there is no meaning in saying that a certain quantum event has happened or that a variable of the system S has taken the value q: rather, there is meaning in saying that the event q has happened or the variable has taken the value q for O, or with respect to O. The apparent contradiction between the two statements that a variable has or hasn't a value is resolved by indexing the statements with the different systems with which the system in question interacts. If I observe an electron at a certain position, I cannot conclude that the electron is there: I can only conclude that the electron as seen by me is there. Quantum events only happen in interactions between systems, and the fact that a quantum event has happened is only true with respect to the systems involved in the interaction. The unique account of the state of the world of the classical theory is thus fractured into a multiplicity of accounts, one for each possible \"observing\" physical system. In the words of (Rovelli 1996): \"Quantum mechanics is a theory about the physical description of physical systems relative to other systems, and this is a complete description of the world\".\nThis relativisation of actuality is viable thanks to a remarkable property of the formalism of quantum mechanics. John von Neumann was the first to notice that the formalism of the theory treats the measured system (S ) and the measuring system (O) differently, but the theory is surprisingly flexible on the choice of where to put the boundary between the two. Different choices give different accounts of the state of the world (for instance, the collapse of the wave function happens at different times); but this does not affect the predictions on the final observations. Von Neumann only described a rather special situation, but this flexibility reflects a general structural property of quantum theory, which guarantees the consistency among all the distinct \"accounts of the world\" of the different observing systems. The manner in which this consistency is realized, however, is subtle.\nWhat appears with respect to O as a measurement of the variable q (with a specific outcome), appears with respect to O\u2032 simply as the establishing of a correlation between S and O (without any specific outcome). As far as the observer O is concerned, a quantum event has happened and a property q of a system S has taken a certain value. As far as the second observer O\u2032 is concerned, the only relevant element of reality is that a correlation is established between S and O. This correlation will manifest itself only in any further observation that O\u2032 would perform on the S+O system. Up to the time in which it physically interacts with S+O, the system O\u2032 has no access to the actual outcomes of the measurements performed by O on S . This actual outcome is real only with respect to O (Rovelli 1996, pp. 1650-52). Consider for instance a two-state system O (say, a light-emitting diode, or l.e.d., which can be on or off) interacting with a two-state system S (say, the spin of an electron, which can be up or down). Assume the interaction is such that if the spin is up (down) the l.e.d. goes on (off). To start with, the electron can be in a superposition of its two states. In the account of the state of the electron that we can associate with the l.e.d., a quantum event happens in the interaction, the wave function of the electron collapses to one of two states, and the l.e.d. is then either on or off. But we can also consider the l.e.d./electron composite system as a quantum system and study the interactions of this composite system with another system O\u2032. In the account associated to O\u2032, there is no event and no collapse at the time of the interaction, and the composite system is still in the superposition of the two states [spin up/l.e.d. on] and [spin down/l.e.d. off] after the interaction. It is necessary to assume this superposition because it accounts for measurable interference effects between the two states: if quantum mechanics is correct, these interference effects are truly observable by O\u2032. So, we have two discordant accounts of the same events. Can the two discord accounts be compared and does the comparison lead to contradiction? They can be compared, because the information on the first account is stored in the state of the l.e.d. and O\u2032 has access to this information. Therefore O and O\u2032 can compare their accounts of the state of the world.\nHowever, the comparison does not lead to contradiction because the comparison is itself a physical process that must be understood in the context of quantum mechanics. Indeed, O\u2032 can physically interact with the electron and then with the l.e.d. (or, equivalently, the other way around). If, for instance, he finds the spin of the electron up, quantum mechanics predicts that he will then consistently find the l.e.d. on (because in the first measurement the state of the composite system collapses on its [spin up/l.e.d. on] component). That is, the multiplicity of accounts leads to no contradiction precisely because the comparison between different accounts can only be a physical quantum interaction. This internal self-consistency of the quantum formalism is general, and it is perhaps its most remarkable aspect. This self consistency is taken in relational quantum mechanics as a strong indication of the relational nature of the world.\nIn fact, one may conjecture that this peculiar consistency between the observations of different observers is the missing ingredient for a reconstruction theorem of the Hilbert space formalism of quantum theory. Such a reconstruction theorem is still unavailable: On the basis of reasonable physical assumptions, one is able to derive the structure of an orthomodular lattice containing subsets that form Boolean algebras, which \"almost\", but not quite, implies the existence of a Hilbert space and its projectors' algebra (see the entry Quantum Logic and Quantum Probability.) Perhaps an appropriate algebraic formulation of the condition of consistency between subsystems could provide the missing hypothesis to complete the reconstruction theorem.\nBas van Fraassen has given an extensive critical discussion of this interpretation; he has also suggested an improvement, in the form of an additional postulate weakly relating the description of the same system given by different observers (van Fraassen 2008). Michel Bitbol has analyzed the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics from a Kantian perspective, substituting functional reference frames for physical (or naturalized) observers (Bitbol 2007).\n3. Correlations\nThe conceptual relevance of correlations in quantum mechanics, \u2014 a central aspect of relational quantum mechanics \u2014 is emphasized by David Mermin, who analyses the statistical features of correlation (Mermin 1998), and arrives at views close to the relational ones. Mermin points out that a theorem on correlations in Hilbert space quantum mechanics is relevant to the problem of what exactly quantum theory tells us about the physical world. Consider a quantum system S with internal parts s, s\u2032,\u2026, that may be considered as subsystems of S , and define the correlations among subsystems as the expectation values of products of subsystems' observables. It can be proved that, for any resolution of S into subsystems, the subsystems' correlations determine uniquely the state of S. According to Mermin, this theorem highlights two major lessons that quantum mechanics teaches us: first, the relevant physics of S is entirely contained in the correlations both among the s, s\u2032,\u2026, themselves (internal correlations) and among the s\u2032,\u2026, and other systems (external correlations); second, correlations may be ascribed physical reality whereas, according to well-known \u2018no-go\u2019 theorems, the quantities that are the terms of the correlations cannot (Mermin 1998).\n4. Self-reference and self-measurement\nFrom a relational point of view, the properties of a system exists only in reference to another system. What about the properties of a system with respect to itself? Can a system measure itself? Is there any meaning of the correlations of a system with itself? Implicit in the relational point of view is the intuition that a complete self-measurement is impossible. It is this impossibility that forces all properties to be referred to another system. The issue of the self-measurement has been analyzed in details in two remarkable works, from very different perspectives, but with similar conclusions, by Marisa Dalla Chiara and by Thomas Breuer.\n4.1 Logical aspect of the measurement problem\nMarisa Dalla Chiara (1977) has addressed the logical aspect of the measurement problem. She observes that the problem of self-measurement in quantum mechanics is strictly related to the self-reference problem, which has an old tradition in logic. From a logical point of view the measurement problem of quantum mechanics can be described as a characteristic question of \"semantical closure\" of a theory. To what extent can quantum mechanics apply consistently to the objects and the concepts in terms of which its metatheory is expressed? Dalla Chiara shows that the duality in the description of state evolution, encoded in the ordinary (i.e. von Neumann's) approach to the measurement problem, can be given a purely logical interpretation: \"If the apparatus observer O is an object of the theory, then O cannot realize the reduction of the wave function. This is possible only to another O\u2032, which is \u2018external\u2019 with respect to the universe of the theory. In other words, any apparatus, as a particular physical system, can be an object of the theory. Nevertheless, any apparatus which realizes the reduction of the wave function is necessarily only a metatheoretical object \" (Dalla Chiara 1977, p. 340). This observation is remarkably consistent with the way in which the state vector reduction is justified within the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics. When the system S+O is considered from the point of view of O\u2032, the measurement can be seen as an interaction whose dynamics is fully unitary, whereas by the point of view of O the measurement breaks the unitarity of the evolution of S. The unitary evolution does not break down through mysterious physical jumps, due to unknown effects, but simply because O is not giving a full dynamical description of the interaction. O cannot have a full description of the interaction of S with himself (O), because his information is correlation information and there is no meaning in being correlated with oneself. If we include the observer into the system, then the evolution is still unitary, but we are now dealing with the description of a different observer.\n4.2 Impossibility of complete self-measurement\nAs is well known, from a purely logical point of view self-reference properties in formal systems impose limitations on the descriptive power of the systems themselves. Thomas Breuer has shown that, from a physical point of view, this feature is expressed by the existence of limitations in the universal validity of physical theories, no matter whether classical or quantum (Breuer 1995). Breuer studies the possibility for an apparatus O to measure its own state. More precisely, of measuring the state of a system containing an apparatus O. He defines a map from the space of all sets of states of the apparatus to the space of all sets of states of the system. Such a map assigns to every set of apparatus states the set of system states that is compatible with the information that \u2014 after the measurement interaction \u2014 the apparatus is in one of these states. Under reasonable assumptions on this map, Breuer is able to prove a theorem stating that no such map can exist that can distinguish all the states of the system. An apparatus O cannot distinguish all the states of a system S containing O. This conclusion holds irrespective of the classical or quantum nature of the systems involved, but in the quantum context it implies that no quantum mechanical apparatus can measure all the quantum correlations between itself and an external system. These correlations are only measurable by a second external apparatus, observing both the system and the first apparatus.\n5.1 Quantum reference systems\nA relational view of quantum mechanics has been proposed also by Gyula Bene (1997). Bene argues that quantum states are relative in the sense that they express a relation between a system to be described and a different system, containing the former as a subsystem and acting for it as a quantum reference system (here the system is contained in the reference system, while in Breuer's work the system contains the apparatus). Consider again a measuring system (O) that has become entangled with a measured system (S ) during a measurement. Once again, the difficulty of quantum theory is that there is an apparent contradiction between the fact that the quantity q of the system assumes an observed value in the measurement, while the composite S+O system still has to be considered in a superposition state, if we want to properly predict the outcome of measurements on the S+O system. This apparent contradiction is resolved by Bene by relativizing the state not to an observer, as in the relational quantum mechanics sketched in Section 2, but rather to a relevant composite system. That is: there is a state of the system S relative to S alone, and a state of the system S relative to the S+O composite system. (Similarly, there is a state of the system O relative to itself alone, and a state of the system O relative to the S+O ensemble.) The ensemble with respect to which the state is defined is called by Bene the quantum reference system . The state of a system with respect to a given quantum reference system correctly predicts the probability distributions of any measurement on the entire reference system. This dependence of the states of quantum systems from different quantum systems that act as reference systems is viewed as a fundamental property that holds no matter whether a system is observed or not.\n5.2 Sigma algebra of interactive properties\nSimilar views have been expressed by Simon Kochen in unpublished but rather well-known notes (Kochen, 1979, preprint). In Kochen's words: \"The basic change in the classical framework which we advocate lies in dropping the assumption of the absoluteness of physical properties of interacting systems\u2026 Thus quantum mechanical properties acquire an interactive or relational character.\" Kochen uses a \u03c3-algebra formalism. Each quantum system has an associated Hilbert space. The properties of the system are established by its interaction with other quantum systems, and these properties are represented by the corresponding projection operators on the Hilbert space. These projectors are elements of a Boolean \u03c3-algebra, determined by the physics of the interaction between the two systems. Suppose a quantum system S can interact with quantum systems Q, Q\u2032,\u2026. In each case, S will acquire an interaction \u03c3-algebra of properties \u03c3(Q), \u03c3(Q\u2032) since the interaction between S and Q may be finer grained than the interaction between S and Q\u2032. Thus, interaction \u03c3-algebras may have non-trivial intersections. The family of all Boolean \u03c3-algebras forms a category, with the sets of the projectors of each \u03c3-algebra as objects. In Kochen's words: \"Just as the state of a composite system does not determine states of its components, conversely, the states of the\u2026 correlated systems do not determine the state of the composite system [\u2026] We thus resolve the measurement problem by cutting the Gordian knot tying the states of component systems uniquely to the state of the combined system.\" This is very similar in spirit to the Bene approach and to Rovelli's relational quantum mechanics, but the precise technical relation between the formalisms utilized in these approaches has not yet been analysed in full detail.\nFurther approaches at least formally related to Kochen's have been proposed by Healey (1989), who also emphasises an interactive aspect of his approach, and by Dieks (1989). See also the entry on \u2019Modal Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics\u2019.\n5.3 Quantum theory of the universe\nRelational views on quantum theory have been defended also by Lee Smolin (1995) and by Louis Crane (1995) in a cosmological context. If one is interested in the quantum theory of the entire universe, then, by definition, an external observer is not available. Breuer's theorem shows then that a quantum state of the universe, containing all correlations between all subsystems, expresses information that is not available, not even in principle, to any observer. In order to write a meaningful quantum state, argue Crane and Smolin, we have to divide the universe in two components and consider the relative quantum state predicting the outcomes of the observations that one component can make on the other.\n5.4 Relation with Everett's relative-state interpretation\nRelational ideas underlie also the interpretations of quantum theory inspired by the work of Everett. Everett\u2019 original work (Everett 1975) relies on the notion of \"relative state\" and has a marked relational tone (see quantum mechanics: Everett's relative-state formulation of ). In the context of Everettian accounts, a state may be taken as relative either (more commonly) to a \"world\", or \"branch\", or (sometimes) to the state of another system (see for instance Saunders 1996, 1998). While the first variant (relationalism with respect to branches) is far from the relational views described here, the second variant (relationalism with respect to the state of a system) is closer.\nHowever, it is different to say that something is relative to a system or that something is relative to a state of a system. Consider for instance the situation described in the example of Section 5: According to the relational interpretation, after the first measurement the quantity q has a given value and only one for O, while in Everettian terms the quantity q has a value for one state of O and a different value for another state of O, and the two are equally real. In Everett, there is an ontological multiplicity of realities, which is absent in the relational point of view, where physisical quantities are uniquely determined, once two systems are given.\nThe difference derives from a very general interpretational difference between Everettian accounts and the relational point of view. Everett (at least in its widespread version) takes the state \u03a8 as the basis of the ontology of quantum theory. The overall state \u03a8 includes different possible branches and different possible outcomes. On the other hand, the relational interpretation takes the quantum events q, that is, the actualizations of values of physical quantities, as the basic elements of reality (see Section 1.1 above) and such q's are assumed to be univocal. The relational view avoids the traditional difficulties in taking the q's as univocal simply by noticing that a q does not refer to a system, but rather to a pair of systems.\nFor a comparison between the relational interpretation and other current interpretations of quantum mechanics, see Rovelli 1996.\n6. Some consequences of the relational point of view\nA number of open conceptual issues in quantum mechanics appear in a different light when seen in the context of a relational interpretation of the theory. In particular, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations have a substantially different interpretation within the perspective of the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics. Laudisa (2001) has argued that the non-locality implied by the conventional EPR argument turns out to be frame-dependent, and this result supports the \"peaceful coexistence\" of quantum mechanics and special relativity. More radically, Rovelli and Smerlak (2006) argue that these correlations do not entail any form of \"non-locality\", when viewed in the context of this interpretation, essentially because there is a quantum event relative to an observer that happens at a spacelike separation from this observer. The abandonment of strict Einstein realism implied by the relational stance permits to reconcile quantum mechanics, completeness and locality.\nAlso, the relational interpretation allows one to give a precise definition of the time (or, better, the probability distribution of the time) at which a measurement happens, in terms of the probability distribution of the correlation between system and apparatus, as measurable by a third observer (Rovelli 1998).\nFinally, it has been suggested in (Rovelli 1997) that the relationalism at the core of quantum theory pointed out by the relational interpretations might be connected with the spatiotemporal relationalism that characterizes general relativity. Quantum mechanical relationalism is the observation that there are no absolute properties: properties of a system S are relative to another system O with which S is interacting. General relativistic relationalism is the well known observation that there is no absolute localization in spacetime: localization of an object S in spacetime is only relative to the gravitational field, or to any other object O, to which S is contiguous. There is a connection between the two, since interaction between S and O implies contiguity and contiguity between S and O can only be checked via some quantum interaction. However, because of the difficulty of developing a consistent and conceptually transparent theory of quantum gravity, so far this suggestion has not been developed beyond the stage of a simple intuition.\n7. Conclusion\nRelational interpretations of quantum mechanics propose a solution to the interpretational difficulties of quantum theory based on the idea of weakening the notions of the state of a system, event, and the idea that a system, at a certain time, may just have a certain property. The world is described as an ensemble of events (\"the electron is the point x\") which happen only relatively to a given observer. Accordingly, the state and the properties of a system are relative to another system only. There is a wide diversity in style, emphasis, and language in the authors that we have mentioned. Indeed, most of the works mentioned have developed independently from each other. But it is rather clear that there is a common idea underlying all these approaches, and the convergence is remarkable.\nWerner Heisenberg first recognized that the electron does not have a well defined position when it is not interacting. Relational interpretations push this intuition further, by stating that, even when interacting, the position of the electron is only determined in relation to a certain observer, or to a certain quantum reference system, or similar.\nIn physics, the move of deepening our insight into the physical world by relativizing notions previously used as absolute has been applied repeatedly and very successfully. Here are a few examples. The notion of the velocity of an object has been recognized as meaningless, unless it is indexed with a reference body with respect to which the object is moving. With special relativity, simultaneity of two distant events has been recognized as meaningless, unless referred to a specific state of motion of something. (This something is usually denoted as \"the observer\" without, of course, any implication that the observer is human or has any other peculiar property besides having a state of motion. Similarly, the \"observer system\" O in quantum mechanics need not to be human or have any other property beside the possibility of interacting with the \"observed\" system S.) With general relativity, the position in space and time of an object has been recognized as meaningless, unless it is referred to the gravitational field, or to some other dynamical physical entity. The move proposed by the relational interpretations of quantum mechanics has strong analogies with these, but is, in a sense, a longer jump, since all physical events and the entirety of the contingent properties of any physical system are taken to be meaningful only as relative to a second physical system. The claim of the relational interpretations is that this is not an arbitrary move. Rather, it is a conclusion which is difficult to escape, following from the observation \u2014 explained above in the example of the \"second observer\" \u2014 that a variable (of a system S) can have a well determined value q for one observer (O) and at the same time fail to have a determined value for another observer (O\u2032).\nThis way of thinking the world has certainly heavy philosophical implications. The claim of the relational interpretations is that it is nature itself that is forcing us to this way of thinking. If we want to understand nature, our task is not to frame nature into our philosophical prejudices, but rather to learn how to adjust our philosophical prejudices to what we learn from nature.\nBene, G., 1992, \"Quantum reference systems: a new framework for quantum mechanics\", Physica, A242: 529-560.\nBreuer, T., 1993, \"The impossibility of accurate state self-measurements\", Philosophy of Science, 62: 197-214.\nCrane, L., 1993, \"Clock and Category: Is Quantum Gravity Algebraic?\", Journal of Mathematical Physics, 36: 6180-6193.\nDalla Chiara, M.L., 1977, \"Logical self-reference, set theoretical paradoxes and the measurement problem in quantum mechanics\", Journal of Philosophical Logic, 6: 331-347.\nEverett H., 1957, \"\u2018Relative State\u2019 Formulation of Quantum Mechanics,\" Reviews of Modern Physics, 29: 454-462.\nDieks, D., 1989, \"Resolution of the Measurement Problem through Decoherence of the Quantum State\", Physics letters, A142: 439-446.\nHealey, R., 1989, The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics: An Interactive Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\nKochen, S., 1979, \"The interpretation of quantum mechanics\", Princeton: Princeton University Preprint.\nLaudisa, F., 2001, \"The EPR Argument in a Relational Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics\", Foundations of Physics Letters, 14: 119-132.\nMermin, N.D., 1998, \"What is quantum mechanics trying to tell us?\", American Journal of Physics, 66: 753-767.\nRovelli, C., 1996, \"Relational quantum mechanics\", International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 35: 1637-1678.\nRovelli, C., 1997, \"Half way through the woods\", in J.

Introduction\nQuantum theory is our current general theory of physical motion. The theory is the core component of the momentous change that our understanding of the physical world has undergone during the first decades of the 20th century. It is one of the most successful scientific theories ever: it is supported by vast and unquestionable empirical and technological effectiveness and is today virtually unchallenged. But the interpretation of what the theory actually tells us about the physical world raises a lively debate, which has continued with alternating fortunes, from the early days of the theory in the late twenties, to nowadays. The relational interpretations are a number of reflections by different authors, which were independently developed, but converge in indicating an interpretation of the physical content of the theory. The core idea is to read the theory as a theoretical account of the way distinct physical systems affect each other when they interact (and not of the way physical systems \"are\"), and the idea that this account exhausts all that can be said about the physical world. The physical world is thus seen as a net of interacting components, where there is no meaning to the state of an isolated system. A physical system (or, more precisely, its contingent state) is reduced to the net of relations it entertains with the surrounding systems, and the physical structure of the world is identified as this net of relationships.\nThe possibility that the physical content of an empirically successful physical theory could be debated should not surprise: examples abound in the history of science. For instance, the great scientific revolution was fueled by the grand debate on whether the effectiveness of the Copernican system could be taken as an indication that the Earth was not in fact at the center of the universe. In more recent times, Einstein's celebrated first major theoretical success, special relativity, consisted to a large extent just in understanding the physical meaning (simultaneity is relative) of an already existing effective mathematical formalism (the Lorentz transformations). In these cases, as in the case of quantum mechanics, a very strictly empiricist position could have circumvented the problem altogether, by reducing the content of the theory to a list of predicted numbers. But perhaps science can offer us more than such a list; and certainly science needs more than such a list to find its ways.\nThe difficulty in the interpretation of quantum mechanics derives from the fact that the theory was first constructed for describing microscopic systems (atoms, electrons, photons) and the way these interact with macroscopic apparatuses built to measure their properties. Such interactions are denoted as \"measurements\". The theory consists in a mathematical formalism, which allows probabilities of alternative outcomes of such measurements to be calculated. If used just for this purpose, the theory raises no difficulty. But we expect the macroscopic apparatuses themselves \u2014 in fact, any physical system in the world \u2014 to obey quantum theory, and this seems to raise contradictions in the theory.\n1.1 The Problem\nIn classical mechanics, a system S is described by a certain number of physical variables. For instance, an electron is described by its position and its spin (intrinsic angular momentum). These variables change with time and represent the contingent properties of the system. We say that their values determine, at every moment, the \"state\" of the system. A measurement of a system's variable is an interaction between the system S and an external system O, whose effect on O, depends on the actual value q of the variable (of S) which is measured. The characteristic feature of quantum mechanics is that it does not allow us to assume that all variables of the system have determined values at every moment (this irrespectively of whether or not we know such values). It was Werner Heisenberg who first realized the need to free ourselves from the belief that, say, an electron has a well determined position at every time. When it is not interacting with an external system that can detect its position, the electron can be \"spread out\" over different positions. In the jargon of the theory, one says that the electron is in a \"quantum superposition\" of two (or many) different positions. It follows that the state of the system cannot be captured by giving the value of its variables. Instead, quantum theory introduces a new notion of \"state\" of a system, which is different from a list of values of its variables. Such a new notion of state was developed in the work of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in the form of the \"wave function\" of the system, usually denoted by \u03a8. Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac gave a general abstract formulation of the notion of quantum state, in terms of a vector \u03a8 moving in an abstract vector space. The time evolution of the state \u03a8 is deterministic and is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. From the knowledge of the state \u03a8, one can compute the probability of the different measurement outcomes q. That is, the probability of the different ways in which the system S can affect a system O in an interaction with it. The theory then prescribes that at every such \u2018measurement\u2019, one must update the value of \u03a8, to take into account which of the different outcomes has happened. This sudden change of the state \u03a8 depends on the specific outcome of the measurement and is therefore probabilistic. It is called the \"collapse of the wave function\".\nThe problem of the interpretation of quantum mechanics takes then different forms, depending on the relative ontological weight we choose to assign to the wave function \u03a8 or, respectively, to the sequence of the measurement outcomes q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026. If we take \u03a8 as the \"real\" entity which fully represents the actual state of affairs of the world, we encounter a number of difficulties. First, we have to understand how \u03a8 can change suddenly in the course of a measurement: if we describe the evolution of two interacting quantum systems in terms of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, no collapse happens. Furthermore, the collapse, seen as a physical process, seems to depend on arbitrary choices in our description and shows a disturbing amount of nonlocality. But even if we can circumvent the collapse problem, the more serious difficulty of this point of view is that it appears to be impossible to understand how specific observed values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 can emerge from the same \u03a8. A better alternative is to take the observed values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 as the actual elements of reality, and view \u03a8 just as a bookkeeping device, determined by the actual values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 that happened in past. From this perspective, the real events of the world are the \"realization\" (the \"coming to reality\", the \"actualization\") of the values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 in the course of the interaction between physical systems. This actualization of a variable q in the course of an interaction can be denoted as the quantum event q. An exemple of a quantum event is the detection of an electron in a certain position. The position variable of the electron assumes a determined value in the course of the interaction between the electron and an external system and the quantum event is the \"manifestation\" of the electron in a certain position. Quantum events have an intrinsically discrete (\"quantized\") granular structure.\nThe difficulty of this second option is that if we take the quantum nature of all physical systems into account, the statement that a certain specific event q \"has happened\" (or, equivalently that a certain variable has or has not taken the value q) can be true and not-true at the same time. To clarify this key point, consider the case in which a system S interacts with another system (an apparatus) O, and exhibits a value q of one of its variables. Assume that the system O obeys the laws of quantum theory as well, and use the quantum theory of the combined system formed by O and S in order to predict the way this combined system can later interact with a third system O\u2032. Then quantum mechanics forbids us to assume that q has happened. Indeed, as far as its later behavior is concerned, the combined system S+O may very well be in a quantum superposition of alternative possible values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026. This \"second observer\" situation captures the core conceptual difficulty of the interpretation of quantum mechanics: reconciling the possibility of quantum superposition with the fact that the observed world is characterized by uniquely determined events q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026. More precisely, it shows that we cannot disentangle the two: according to the theory an observed quantity (q) can be at the same time determined and not determined. An event may have happened and at the same time may not have happened.\n2. Relational view of quantum states\nThe way out from this dilemma suggested by the relational interpretations is that the quantum events, and thus the values of the variables of a physical system S, namely the q's, are relational. That is, they do not express properties of the system S alone, but rather refer to the relation between two systems.\nThe best developed of these interpretations is relational quantum mechanics (Rovelli 1996, 1997). For a detailed and critical account of this view of quantum theory, see (van Fraassen 2008) and (Bitbol 2007). The central tenet of relational quantum mechanics is that there is no meaning in saying that a certain quantum event has happened or that a variable of the system S has taken the value q: rather, there is meaning in saying that the event q has happened or the variable has taken the value q for O, or with respect to O. The apparent contradiction between the two statements that a variable has or hasn't a value is resolved by indexing the statements with the different systems with which the system in question interacts. If I observe an electron at a certain position, I cannot conclude that the electron is there: I can only conclude that the electron as seen by me is there. Quantum events only happen in interactions between systems, and the fact that a quantum event has happened is only true with respect to the systems involved in the interaction. The unique account of the state of the world of the classical theory is thus fractured into a multiplicity of accounts, one for each possible \"observing\" physical system. In the words of (Rovelli 1996): \"Quantum mechanics is a theory about the physical description of physical systems relative to other systems, and this is a complete description of the world\".\nThis relativisation of actuality is viable thanks to a remarkable property of the formalism of quantum mechanics. John von Neumann was the first to notice that the formalism of the theory treats the measured system (S ) and the measuring system (O) differently, but the theory is surprisingly flexible on the choice of where to put the boundary between the two. Different choices give different accounts of the state of the world (for instance, the collapse of the wave function happens at different times); but this does not affect the predictions on the final observations. Von Neumann only described a rather special situation, but this flexibility reflects a general structural property of quantum theory, which guarantees the consistency among all the distinct \"accounts of the world\" of the different observing systems. The manner in which this consistency is realized, however, is subtle.\nWhat appears with respect to O as a measurement of the variable q (with a specific outcome), appears with respect to O\u2032 simply as the establishing of a correlation between S and O (without any specific outcome). As far as the observer O is concerned, a quantum event has happened and a property q of a system S has taken a certain value. As far as the second observer O\u2032 is concerned, the only relevant element of reality is that a correlation is established between S and O. This correlation will manifest itself only in any further observation that O\u2032 would perform on the S+O system. Up to the time in which it physically interacts with S+O, the system O\u2032 has no access to the actual outcomes of the measurements performed by O on S . This actual outcome is real only with respect to O (Rovelli 1996, pp. 1650-52). Consider for instance a two-state system O (say, a light-emitting diode, or l.e.d., which can be on or off) interacting with a two-state system S (say, the spin of an electron, which can be up or down). Assume the interaction is such that if the spin is up (down) the l.e.d. goes on (off). To start with, the electron can be in a superposition of its two states. In the account of the state of the electron that we can associate with the l.e.d., a quantum event happens in the interaction, the wave function of the electron collapses to one of two states, and the l.e.d. is then either on or off. But we can also consider the l.e.d./electron composite system as a quantum system and study the interactions of this composite system with another system O\u2032. In the account associated to O\u2032, there is no event and no collapse at the time of the interaction, and the composite system is still in the superposition of the two states [spin up/l.e.d. on] and [spin down/l.e.d. off] after the interaction. It is necessary to assume this superposition because it accounts for measurable interference effects between the two states: if quantum mechanics is correct, these interference effects are truly observable by O\u2032. So, we have two discordant accounts of the same events. Can the two discord accounts be compared and does the comparison lead to contradiction? They can be compared, because the information on the first account is stored in the state of the l.e.d. and O\u2032 has access to this information. Therefore O and O\u2032 can compare their accounts of the state of the world.\nHowever, the comparison does not lead to contradiction because the comparison is itself a physical process that must be understood in the context of quantum mechanics. Indeed, O\u2032 can physically interact with the electron and then with the l.e.d. (or, equivalently, the other way around). If, for instance, he finds the spin of the electron up, quantum mechanics predicts that he will then consistently find the l.e.d. on (because in the first measurement the state of the composite system collapses on its [spin up/l.e.d. on] component). That is, the multiplicity of accounts leads to no contradiction precisely because the comparison between different accounts can only be a physical quantum interaction. This internal self-consistency of the quantum formalism is general, and it is perhaps its most remarkable aspect. This self consistency is taken in relational quantum mechanics as a strong indication of the relational nature of the world.\nIn fact, one may conjecture that this peculiar consistency between the observations of different observers is the missing ingredient for a reconstruction theorem of the Hilbert space formalism of quantum theory. Such a reconstruction theorem is still unavailable: On the basis of reasonable physical assumptions, one is able to derive the structure of an orthomodular lattice containing subsets that form Boolean algebras, which \"almost\", but not quite, implies the existence of a Hilbert space and its projectors' algebra (see the entry Quantum Logic and Quantum Probability.) Perhaps an appropriate algebraic formulation of the condition of consistency between subsystems could provide the missing hypothesis to complete the reconstruction theorem.\nBas van Fraassen has given an extensive critical discussion of this interpretation; he has also suggested an improvement, in the form of an additional postulate weakly relating the description of the same system given by different observers (van Fraassen 2008). Michel Bitbol has analyzed the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics from a Kantian perspective, substituting functional reference frames for physical (or naturalized) observers (Bitbol 2007).\n3. Correlations\nThe conceptual relevance of correlations in quantum mechanics, \u2014 a central aspect of relational quantum mechanics \u2014 is emphasized by David Mermin, who analyses the statistical features of correlation (Mermin 1998), and arrives at views close to the relational ones. Mermin points out that a theorem on correlations in Hilbert space quantum mechanics is relevant to the problem of what exactly quantum theory tells us about the physical world. Consider a quantum system S with internal parts s, s\u2032,\u2026, that may be considered as subsystems of S , and define the correlations among subsystems as the expectation values of products of subsystems' observables. It can be proved that, for any resolution of S into subsystems, the subsystems' correlations determine uniquely the state of S. According to Mermin, this theorem highlights two major lessons that quantum mechanics teaches us: first, the relevant physics of S is entirely contained in the correlations both among the s, s\u2032,\u2026, themselves (internal correlations) and among the s\u2032,\u2026, and other systems (external correlations); second, correlations may be ascribed physical reality whereas, according to well-known \u2018no-go\u2019 theorems, the quantities that are the terms of the correlations cannot (Mermin 1998).\n4. Self-reference and self-measurement\nFrom a relational point of view, the properties of a system exists only in reference to another system. What about the properties of a system with respect to itself? Can a system measure itself? Is there any meaning of the correlations of a system with itself? Implicit in the relational point of view is the intuition that a complete self-measurement is impossible. It is this impossibility that forces all properties to be referred to another system. The issue of the self-measurement has been analyzed in details in two remarkable works, from very different perspectives, but with similar conclusions, by Marisa Dalla Chiara and by Thomas Breuer.\n4.1 Logical aspect of the measurement problem\nMarisa Dalla Chiara (1977) has addressed the logical aspect of the measurement problem. She observes that the problem of self-measurement in quantum mechanics is strictly related to the self-reference problem, which has an old tradition in logic. From a logical point of view the measurement problem of quantum mechanics can be described as a characteristic question of \"semantical closure\" of a theory. To what extent can quantum mechanics apply consistently to the objects and the concepts in terms of which its metatheory is expressed? Dalla Chiara shows that the duality in the description of state evolution, encoded in the ordinary (i.e. von Neumann's) approach to the measurement problem, can be given a purely logical interpretation: \"If the apparatus observer O is an object of the theory, then O cannot realize the reduction of the wave function. This is possible only to another O\u2032, which is \u2018external\u2019 with respect to the universe of the theory. In other words, any apparatus, as a particular physical system, can be an object of the theory. Nevertheless, any apparatus which realizes the reduction of the wave function is necessarily only a metatheoretical object \" (Dalla Chiara 1977, p. 340). This observation is remarkably consistent with the way in which the state vector reduction is justified within the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics. When the system S+O is considered from the point of view of O\u2032, the measurement can be seen as an interaction whose dynamics is fully unitary, whereas by the point of view of O the measurement breaks the unitarity of the evolution of S. The unitary evolution does not break down through mysterious physical jumps, due to unknown effects, but simply because O is not giving a full dynamical description of the interaction. O cannot have a full description of the interaction of S with himself (O), because his information is correlation information and there is no meaning in being correlated with oneself. If we include the observer into the system, then the evolution is still unitary, but we are now dealing with the description of a different observer.\n4.2 Impossibility of complete self-measurement\nAs is well known, from a purely logical point of view self-reference properties in formal systems impose limitations on the descriptive power of the systems themselves. Thomas Breuer has shown that, from a physical point of view, this feature is expressed by the existence of limitations in the universal validity of physical theories, no matter whether classical or quantum (Breuer 1995). Breuer studies the possibility for an apparatus O to measure its own state. More precisely, of measuring the state of a system containing an apparatus O. He defines a map from the space of all sets of states of the apparatus to the space of all sets of states of the system. Such a map assigns to every set of apparatus states the set of system states that is compatible with the information that \u2014 after the measurement interaction \u2014 the apparatus is in one of these states. Under reasonable assumptions on this map, Breuer is able to prove a theorem stating that no such map can exist that can distinguish all the states of the system. An apparatus O cannot distinguish all the states of a system S containing O. This conclusion holds irrespective of the classical or quantum nature of the systems involved, but in the quantum context it implies that no quantum mechanical apparatus can measure all the quantum correlations between itself and an external system. These correlations are only measurable by a second external apparatus, observing both the system and the first apparatus.\n5.1 Quantum reference systems\nA relational view of quantum mechanics has been proposed also by Gyula Bene (1997). Bene argues that quantum states are relative in the sense that they express a relation between a system to be described and a different system, containing the former as a subsystem and acting for it as a quantum reference system (here the system is contained in the reference system, while in Breuer's work the system contains the apparatus). Consider again a measuring system (O) that has become entangled with a measured system (S ) during a measurement. Once again, the difficulty of quantum theory is that there is an apparent contradiction between the fact that the quantity q of the system assumes an observed value in the measurement, while the composite S+O system still has to be considered in a superposition state, if we want to properly predict the outcome of measurements on the S+O system. This apparent contradiction is resolved by Bene by relativizing the state not to an observer, as in the relational quantum mechanics sketched in Section 2, but rather to a relevant composite system. That is: there is a state of the system S relative to S alone, and a state of the system S relative to the S+O composite system. (Similarly, there is a state of the system O relative to itself alone, and a state of the system O relative to the S+O ensemble.) The ensemble with respect to which the state is defined is called by Bene the quantum reference system . The state of a system with respect to a given quantum reference system correctly predicts the probability distributions of any measurement on the entire reference system. This dependence of the states of quantum systems from different quantum systems that act as reference systems is viewed as a fundamental property that holds no matter whether a system is observed or not.\n5.2 Sigma algebra of interactive properties\nSimilar views have been expressed by Simon Kochen in unpublished but rather well-known notes (Kochen, 1979, preprint). In Kochen's words: \"The basic change in the classical framework which we advocate lies in dropping the assumption of the absoluteness of physical properties of interacting systems\u2026 Thus quantum mechanical properties acquire an interactive or relational character.\" Kochen uses a \u03c3-algebra formalism. Each quantum system has an associated Hilbert space. The properties of the system are established by its interaction with other quantum systems, and these properties are represented by the corresponding projection operators on the Hilbert space. These projectors are elements of a Boolean \u03c3-algebra, determined by the physics of the interaction between the two systems. Suppose a quantum system S can interact with quantum systems Q, Q\u2032,\u2026. In each case, S will acquire an interaction \u03c3-algebra of properties \u03c3(Q), \u03c3(Q\u2032) since the interaction between S and Q may be finer grained than the interaction between S and Q\u2032. Thus, interaction \u03c3-algebras may have non-trivial intersections. The family of all Boolean \u03c3-algebras forms a category, with the sets of the projectors of each \u03c3-algebra as objects. In Kochen's words: \"Just as the state of a composite system does not determine states of its components, conversely, the states of the\u2026 correlated systems do not determine the state of the composite system [\u2026] We thus resolve the measurement problem by cutting the Gordian knot tying the states of component systems uniquely to the state of the combined system.\" This is very similar in spirit to the Bene approach and to Rovelli's relational quantum mechanics, but the precise technical relation between the formalisms utilized in these approaches has not yet been analysed in full detail.\nFurther approaches at least formally related to Kochen's have been proposed by Healey (1989), who also emphasises an interactive aspect of his approach, and by Dieks (1989). See also the entry on \u2019Modal Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics\u2019.\n5.3 Quantum theory of the universe\nRelational views on quantum theory have been defended also by Lee Smolin (1995) and by Louis Crane (1995) in a cosmological context. If one is interested in the quantum theory of the entire universe, then, by definition, an external observer is not available. Breuer's theorem shows then that a quantum state of the universe, containing all correlations between all subsystems, expresses information that is not available, not even in principle, to any observer. In order to write a meaningful quantum state, argue Crane and Smolin, we have to divide the universe in two components and consider the relative quantum state predicting the outcomes of the observations that one component can make on the other.\n5.4 Relation with Everett's relative-state interpretation\nRelational ideas underlie also the interpretations of quantum theory inspired by the work of Everett. Everett\u2019 original work (Everett 1975) relies on the notion of \"relative state\" and has a marked relational tone (see quantum mechanics: Everett's relative-state formulation of ). In the context of Everettian accounts, a state may be taken as relative either (more commonly) to a \"world\", or \"branch\", or (sometimes) to the state of another system (see for instance Saunders 1996, 1998). While the first variant (relationalism with respect to branches) is far from the relational views described here, the second variant (relationalism with respect to the state of a system) is closer.\nHowever, it is different to say that something is relative to a system or that something is relative to a state of a system. Consider for instance the situation described in the example of Section 5: According to the relational interpretation, after the first measurement the quantity q has a given value and only one for O, while in Everettian terms the quantity q has a value for one state of O and a different value for another state of O, and the two are equally real. In Everett, there is an ontological multiplicity of realities, which is absent in the relational point of view, where physisical quantities are uniquely determined, once two systems are given.\nThe difference derives from a very general interpretational difference between Everettian accounts and the relational point of view. Everett (at least in its widespread version) takes the state \u03a8 as the basis of the ontology of quantum theory. The overall state \u03a8 includes different possible branches and different possible outcomes. On the other hand, the relational interpretation takes the quantum events q, that is, the actualizations of values of physical quantities, as the basic elements of reality (see Section 1.1 above) and such q's are assumed to be univocal. The relational view avoids the traditional difficulties in taking the q's as univocal simply by noticing that a q does not refer to a system, but rather to a pair of systems.\nFor a comparison between the relational interpretation and other current interpretations of quantum mechanics, see Rovelli 1996.\n6. Some consequences of the relational point of view\nA number of open conceptual issues in quantum mechanics appear in a different light when seen in the context of a relational interpretation of the theory. In particular, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations have a substantially different interpretation within the perspective of the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics. Laudisa (2001) has argued that the non-locality implied by the conventional EPR argument turns out to be frame-dependent, and this result supports the \"peaceful coexistence\" of quantum mechanics and special relativity. More radically, Rovelli and Smerlak (2006) argue that these correlations do not entail any form of \"non-locality\", when viewed in the context of this interpretation, essentially because there is a quantum event relative to an observer that happens at a spacelike separation from this observer. The abandonment of strict Einstein realism implied by the relational stance permits to reconcile quantum mechanics, completeness and locality.\nAlso, the relational interpretation allows one to give a precise definition of the time (or, better, the probability distribution of the time) at which a measurement happens, in terms of the probability distribution of the correlation between system and apparatus, as measurable by a third observer (Rovelli 1998).\nFinally, it has been suggested in (Rovelli 1997) that the relationalism at the core of quantum theory pointed out by the relational interpretations might be connected with the spatiotemporal relationalism that characterizes general relativity. Quantum mechanical relationalism is the observation that there are no absolute properties: properties of a system S are relative to another system O with which S is interacting. General relativistic relationalism is the well known observation that there is no absolute localization in spacetime: localization of an object S in spacetime is only relative to the gravitational field, or to any other object O, to which S is contiguous. There is a connection between the two, since interaction between S and O implies contiguity and contiguity between S and O can only be checked via some quantum interaction. However, because of the difficulty of developing a consistent and conceptually transparent theory of quantum gravity, so far this suggestion has not been developed beyond the stage of a simple intuition.\n7. Conclusion\nRelational interpretations of quantum mechanics propose a solution to the interpretational difficulties of quantum theory based on the idea of weakening the notions of the state of a system, event, and the idea that a system, at a certain time, may just have a certain property. The world is described as an ensemble of events (\"the electron is the point x\") which happen only relatively to a given observer. Accordingly, the state and the properties of a system are relative to another system only. There is a wide diversity in style, emphasis, and language in the authors that we have mentioned. Indeed, most of the works mentioned have developed independently from each other. But it is rather clear that there is a common idea underlying all these approaches, and the convergence is remarkable.\nWerner Heisenberg first recognized that the electron does not have a well defined position when it is not interacting. Relational interpretations push this intuition further, by stating that, even when interacting, the position of the electron is only determined in relation to a certain observer, or to a certain quantum reference system, or similar.\nIn physics, the move of deepening our insight into the physical world by relativizing notions previously used as absolute has been applied repeatedly and very successfully. Here are a few examples. The notion of the velocity of an object has been recognized as meaningless, unless it is indexed with a reference body with respect to which the object is moving. With special relativity, simultaneity of two distant events has been recognized as meaningless, unless referred to a specific state of motion of something. (This something is usually denoted as \"the observer\" without, of course, any implication that the observer is human or has any other peculiar property besides having a state of motion. Similarly, the \"observer system\" O in quantum mechanics need not to be human or have any other property beside the possibility of interacting with the \"observed\" system S.) With general relativity, the position in space and time of an object has been recognized as meaningless, unless it is referred to the gravitational field, or to some other dynamical physical entity. The move proposed by the relational interpretations of quantum mechanics has strong analogies with these, but is, in a sense, a longer jump, since all physical events and the entirety of the contingent properties of any physical system are taken to be meaningful only as relative to a second physical system. The claim of the relational interpretations is that this is not an arbitrary move. Rather, it is a conclusion which is difficult to escape, following from the observation \u2014 explained above in the example of the \"second observer\" \u2014 that a variable (of a system S) can have a well determined value q for one observer (O) and at the same time fail to have a determined value for another observer (O\u2032).\nThis way of thinking the world has certainly heavy philosophical implications. The claim of the relational interpretations is that it is nature itself that is forcing us to this way of thinking.

Introduction\nQuantum theory is our current general theory of physical motion. The theory is the core component of the momentous change that our understanding of the physical world has undergone during the first decades of the 20th century. It is one of the most successful scientific theories ever: it is supported by vast and unquestionable empirical and technological effectiveness and is today virtually unchallenged. But the interpretation of what the theory actually tells us about the physical world raises a lively debate, which has continued with alternating fortunes, from the early days of the theory in the late twenties, to nowadays. The relational interpretations are a number of reflections by different authors, which were independently developed, but converge in indicating an interpretation of the physical content of the theory. The core idea is to read the theory as a theoretical account of the way distinct physical systems affect each other when they interact (and not of the way physical systems \"are\"), and the idea that this account exhausts all that can be said about the physical world. The physical world is thus seen as a net of interacting components, where there is no meaning to the state of an isolated system. A physical system (or, more precisely, its contingent state) is reduced to the net of relations it entertains with the surrounding systems, and the physical structure of the world is identified as this net of relationships.\nThe possibility that the physical content of an empirically successful physical theory could be debated should not surprise: examples abound in the history of science. For instance, the great scientific revolution was fueled by the grand debate on whether the effectiveness of the Copernican system could be taken as an indication that the Earth was not in fact at the center of the universe. In more recent times, Einstein's celebrated first major theoretical success, special relativity, consisted to a large extent just in understanding the physical meaning (simultaneity is relative) of an already existing effective mathematical formalism (the Lorentz transformations). In these cases, as in the case of quantum mechanics, a very strictly empiricist position could have circumvented the problem altogether, by reducing the content of the theory to a list of predicted numbers. But perhaps science can offer us more than such a list; and certainly science needs more than such a list to find its ways.\nThe difficulty in the interpretation of quantum mechanics derives from the fact that the theory was first constructed for describing microscopic systems (atoms, electrons, photons) and the way these interact with macroscopic apparatuses built to measure their properties. Such interactions are denoted as \"measurements\". The theory consists in a mathematical formalism, which allows probabilities of alternative outcomes of such measurements to be calculated. If used just for this purpose, the theory raises no difficulty. But we expect the macroscopic apparatuses themselves \u2014 in fact, any physical system in the world \u2014 to obey quantum theory, and this seems to raise contradictions in the theory.\n1.1 The Problem\nIn classical mechanics, a system S is described by a certain number of physical variables. For instance, an electron is described by its position and its spin (intrinsic angular momentum). These variables change with time and represent the contingent properties of the system. We say that their values determine, at every moment, the \"state\" of the system. A measurement of a system's variable is an interaction between the system S and an external system O, whose effect on O, depends on the actual value q of the variable (of S) which is measured. The characteristic feature of quantum mechanics is that it does not allow us to assume that all variables of the system have determined values at every moment (this irrespectively of whether or not we know such values). It was Werner Heisenberg who first realized the need to free ourselves from the belief that, say, an electron has a well determined position at every time. When it is not interacting with an external system that can detect its position, the electron can be \"spread out\" over different positions. In the jargon of the theory, one says that the electron is in a \"quantum superposition\" of two (or many) different positions. It follows that the state of the system cannot be captured by giving the value of its variables. Instead, quantum theory introduces a new notion of \"state\" of a system, which is different from a list of values of its variables. Such a new notion of state was developed in the work of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in the form of the \"wave function\" of the system, usually denoted by \u03a8. Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac gave a general abstract formulation of the notion of quantum state, in terms of a vector \u03a8 moving in an abstract vector space. The time evolution of the state \u03a8 is deterministic and is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. From the knowledge of the state \u03a8, one can compute the probability of the different measurement outcomes q. That is, the probability of the different ways in which the system S can affect a system O in an interaction with it. The theory then prescribes that at every such \u2018measurement\u2019, one must update the value of \u03a8, to take into account which of the different outcomes has happened. This sudden change of the state \u03a8 depends on the specific outcome of the measurement and is therefore probabilistic. It is called the \"collapse of the wave function\".\nThe problem of the interpretation of quantum mechanics takes then different forms, depending on the relative ontological weight we choose to assign to the wave function \u03a8 or, respectively, to the sequence of the measurement outcomes q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026. If we take \u03a8 as the \"real\" entity which fully represents the actual state of affairs of the world, we encounter a number of difficulties. First, we have to understand how \u03a8 can change suddenly in the course of a measurement: if we describe the evolution of two interacting quantum systems in terms of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, no collapse happens. Furthermore, the collapse, seen as a physical process, seems to depend on arbitrary choices in our description and shows a disturbing amount of nonlocality. But even if we can circumvent the collapse problem, the more serious difficulty of this point of view is that it appears to be impossible to understand how specific observed values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 can emerge from the same \u03a8. A better alternative is to take the observed values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 as the actual elements of reality, and view \u03a8 just as a bookkeeping device, determined by the actual values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 that happened in past. From this perspective, the real events of the world are the \"realization\" (the \"coming to reality\", the \"actualization\") of the values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026 in the course of the interaction between physical systems. This actualization of a variable q in the course of an interaction can be denoted as the quantum event q. An exemple of a quantum event is the detection of an electron in a certain position. The position variable of the electron assumes a determined value in the course of the interaction between the electron and an external system and the quantum event is the \"manifestation\" of the electron in a certain position. Quantum events have an intrinsically discrete (\"quantized\") granular structure.\nThe difficulty of this second option is that if we take the quantum nature of all physical systems into account, the statement that a certain specific event q \"has happened\" (or, equivalently that a certain variable has or has not taken the value q) can be true and not-true at the same time. To clarify this key point, consider the case in which a system S interacts with another system (an apparatus) O, and exhibits a value q of one of its variables. Assume that the system O obeys the laws of quantum theory as well, and use the quantum theory of the combined system formed by O and S in order to predict the way this combined system can later interact with a third system O\u2032. Then quantum mechanics forbids us to assume that q has happened. Indeed, as far as its later behavior is concerned, the combined system S+O may very well be in a quantum superposition of alternative possible values q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026. This \"second observer\" situation captures the core conceptual difficulty of the interpretation of quantum mechanics: reconciling the possibility of quantum superposition with the fact that the observed world is characterized by uniquely determined events q, q\u2032, q\u2033, \u2026. More precisely, it shows that we cannot disentangle the two: according to the theory an observed quantity (q) can be at the same time determined and not determined. An event may have happened and at the same time may not have happened.\n2. Relational view of quantum states\nThe way out from this dilemma suggested by the relational interpretations is that the quantum events, and thus the values of the variables of a physical system S, namely the q's, are relational. That is, they do not express properties of the system S alone, but rather refer to the relation between two systems.\nThe best developed of these interpretations is relational quantum mechanics (Rovelli 1996, 1997). For a detailed and critical account of this view of quantum theory, see (van Fraassen 2008) and (Bitbol 2007). The central tenet of relational quantum mechanics is that there is no meaning in saying that a certain quantum event has happened or that a variable of the system S has taken the value q: rather, there is meaning in saying that the event q has happened or the variable has taken the value q for O, or with respect to O. The apparent contradiction between the two statements that a variable has or hasn't a value is resolved by indexing the statements with the different systems with which the system in question interacts. If I observe an electron at a certain position, I cannot conclude that the electron is there: I can only conclude that the electron as seen by me is there. Quantum events only happen in interactions between systems, and the fact that a quantum event has happened is only true with respect to the systems involved in the interaction. The unique account of the state of the world of the classical theory is thus fractured into a multiplicity of accounts, one for each possible \"observing\" physical system. In the words of (Rovelli 1996): \"Quantum mechanics is a theory about the physical description of physical systems relative to other systems, and this is a complete description of the world\".\nThis relativisation of actuality is viable thanks to a remarkable property of the formalism of quantum mechanics. John von Neumann was the first to notice that the formalism of the theory treats the measured system (S ) and the measuring system (O) differently, but the theory is surprisingly flexible on the choice of where to put the boundary between the two. Different choices give different accounts of the state of the world (for instance, the collapse of the wave function happens at different times); but this does not affect the predictions on the final observations. Von Neumann only described a rather special situation, but this flexibility reflects a general structural property of quantum theory, which guarantees the consistency among all the distinct \"accounts of the world\" of the different observing systems. The manner in which this consistency is realized, however, is subtle.\nWhat appears with respect to O as a measurement of the variable q (with a specific outcome), appears with respect to O\u2032 simply as the establishing of a correlation between S and O (without any specific outcome). As far as the observer O is concerned, a quantum event has happened and a property q of a system S has taken a certain value. As far as the second observer O\u2032 is concerned, the only relevant element of reality is that a correlation is established between S and O. This correlation will manifest itself only in any further observation that O\u2032 would perform on the S+O system. Up to the time in which it physically interacts with S+O, the system O\u2032 has no access to the actual outcomes of the measurements performed by O on S . This actual outcome is real only with respect to O (Rovelli 1996, pp. 1650-52). Consider for instance a two-state system O (say, a light-emitting diode, or l.e.d., which can be on or off) interacting with a two-state system S (say, the spin of an electron, which can be up or down). Assume the interaction is such that if the spin is up (down) the l.e.d. goes on (off). To start with, the electron can be in a superposition of its two states. In the account of the state of the electron that we can associate with the l.e.d., a quantum event happens in the interaction, the wave function of the electron collapses to one of two states, and the l.e.d. is then either on or off. But we can also consider the l.e.d./electron composite system as a quantum system and study the interactions of this composite system with another system O\u2032. In the account associated to O\u2032, there is no event and no collapse at the time of the interaction, and the composite system is still in the superposition of the two states [spin up/l.e.d. on] and [spin down/l.e.d. off] after the interaction. It is necessary to assume this superposition because it accounts for measurable interference effects between the two states: if quantum mechanics is correct, these interference effects are truly observable by O\u2032. So, we have two discordant accounts of the same events. Can the two discord accounts be compared and does the comparison lead to contradiction? They can be compared, because the information on the first account is stored in the state of the l.e.d. and O\u2032 has access to this information. Therefore O and O\u2032 can compare their accounts of the state of the world.\nHowever, the comparison does not lead to contradiction because the comparison is itself a physical process that must be understood in the context of quantum mechanics. Indeed, O\u2032 can physically interact with the electron and then with the l.e.d. (or, equivalently, the other way around). If, for instance, he finds the spin of the electron up, quantum mechanics predicts that he will then consistently find the l.e.d. on (because in the first measurement the state of the composite system collapses on its [spin up/l.e.d. on] component). That is, the multiplicity of accounts leads to no contradiction precisely because the comparison between different accounts can only be a physical quantum interaction. This internal self-consistency of the quantum formalism is general, and it is perhaps its most remarkable aspect. This self consistency is taken in relational quantum mechanics as a strong indication of the relational nature of the world.\nIn fact, one may conjecture that this peculiar consistency between the observations of different observers is the missing ingredient for a reconstruction theorem of the Hilbert space formalism of quantum theory. Such a reconstruction theorem is still unavailable: On the basis of reasonable physical assumptions, one is able to derive the structure of an orthomodular lattice containing subsets that form Boolean algebras, which \"almost\", but not quite, implies the existence of a Hilbert space and its projectors' algebra (see the entry Quantum Logic and Quantum Probability.) Perhaps an appropriate algebraic formulation of the condition of consistency between subsystems could provide the missing hypothesis to complete the reconstruction theorem.\nBas van Fraassen has given an extensive critical discussion of this interpretation; he has also suggested an improvement, in the form of an additional postulate weakly relating the description of the same system given by different observers (van Fraassen 2008). Michel Bitbol has analyzed the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics from a Kantian perspective, substituting functional reference frames for physical (or naturalized) observers (Bitbol 2007).\n3. Correlations\nThe conceptual relevance of correlations in quantum mechanics, \u2014 a central aspect of relational quantum mechanics \u2014 is emphasized by David Mermin, who analyses the statistical features of correlation (Mermin 1998), and arrives at views close to the relational ones. Mermin points out that a theorem on correlations in Hilbert space quantum mechanics is relevant to the problem of what exactly quantum theory tells us about the physical world. Consider a quantum system S with internal parts s, s\u2032,\u2026, that may be considered as subsystems of S , and define the correlations among subsystems as the expectation values of products of subsystems' observables. It can be proved that, for any resolution of S into subsystems, the subsystems' correlations determine uniquely the state of S. According to Mermin, this theorem highlights two major lessons that quantum mechanics teaches us: first, the relevant physics of S is entirely contained in the correlations both among the s, s\u2032,\u2026, themselves (internal correlations) and among the s\u2032,\u2026, and other systems (external correlations); second, correlations may be ascribed physical reality whereas, according to well-known \u2018no-go\u2019 theorems, the quantities that are the terms of the correlations cannot (Mermin 1998).\n4. Self-reference and self-measurement\nFrom a relational point of view, the properties of a system exists only in reference to another system. What about the properties of a system with respect to itself? Can a system measure itself? Is there any meaning of the correlations of a system with itself? Implicit in the relational point of view is the intuition that a complete self-measurement is impossible. It is this impossibility that forces all properties to be referred to another system. The issue of the self-measurement has been analyzed in details in two remarkable works, from very different perspectives, but with similar conclusions, by Marisa Dalla Chiara and by Thomas Breuer.\n4.1 Logical aspect of the measurement problem\nMarisa Dalla Chiara (1977) has addressed the logical aspect of the measurement problem. She observes that the problem of self-measurement in quantum mechanics is strictly related to the self-reference problem, which has an old tradition in logic. From a logical point of view the measurement problem of quantum mechanics can be described as a characteristic question of \"semantical closure\" of a theory. To what extent can quantum mechanics apply consistently to the objects and the concepts in terms of which its metatheory is expressed? Dalla Chiara shows that the duality in the description of state evolution, encoded in the ordinary (i.e. von Neumann's) approach to the measurement problem, can be given a purely logical interpretation: \"If the apparatus observer O is an object of the theory, then O cannot realize the reduction of the wave function. This is possible only to another O\u2032, which is \u2018external\u2019 with respect to the universe of the theory. In other words, any apparatus, as a particular physical system, can be an object of the theory. Nevertheless, any apparatus which realizes the reduction of the wave function is necessarily only a metatheoretical object \" (Dalla Chiara 1977, p. 340). This observation is remarkably consistent with the way in which the state vector reduction is justified within the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics. When the system S+O is considered from the point of view of O\u2032, the measurement can be seen as an interaction whose dynamics is fully unitary, whereas by the point of view of O the measurement breaks the unitarity of the evolution of S. The unitary evolution does not break down through mysterious physical jumps, due to unknown effects, but simply because O is not giving a full dynamical description of the interaction. O cannot have a full description of the interaction of S with himself (O), because his information is correlation information and there is no meaning in being correlated with oneself. If we include the observer into the system, then the evolution is still unitary, but we are now dealing with the description of a different observer.\n4.2 Impossibility of complete self-measurement\nAs is well known, from a purely logical point of view self-reference properties in formal systems impose limitations on the descriptive power of the systems themselves. Thomas Breuer has shown that, from a physical point of view, this feature is expressed by the existence of limitations in the universal validity of physical theories, no matter whether classical or quantum (Breuer 1995). Breuer studies the possibility for an apparatus O to measure its own state. More precisely, of measuring the state of a system containing an apparatus O. He defines a map from the space of all sets of states of the apparatus to the space of all sets of states of the system. Such a map assigns to every set of apparatus states the set of system states that is compatible with the information that \u2014 after the measurement interaction \u2014 the apparatus is in one of these states. Under reasonable assumptions on this map, Breuer is able to prove a theorem stating that no such map can exist that can distinguish all the states of the system. An apparatus O cannot distinguish all the states of a system S containing O. This conclusion holds irrespective of the classical or quantum nature of the systems involved, but in the quantum context it implies that no quantum mechanical apparatus can measure all the quantum correlations between itself and an external system. These correlations are only measurable by a second external apparatus, observing both the system and the first apparatus.\n5.1 Quantum reference systems\nA relational view of quantum mechanics has been proposed also by Gyula Bene (1997). Bene argues that quantum states are relative in the sense that they express a relation between a system to be described and a different system, containing the former as a subsystem and acting for it as a quantum reference system (here the system is contained in the reference system, while in Breuer's work the system contains the apparatus). Consider again a measuring system (O) that has become entangled with a measured system (S ) during a measurement. Once again, the difficulty of quantum theory is that there is an apparent contradiction between the fact that the quantity q of the system assumes an observed value in the measurement, while the composite S+O system still has to be considered in a superposition state, if we want to properly predict the outcome of measurements on the S+O system. This apparent contradiction is resolved by Bene by relativizing the state not to an observer, as in the relational quantum mechanics sketched in Section 2, but rather to a relevant composite system. That is: there is a state of the system S relative to S alone, and a state of the system S relative to the S+O composite system. (Similarly, there is a state of the system O relative to itself alone, and a state of the system O relative to the S+O ensemble.) The ensemble with respect to which the state is defined is called by Bene the quantum reference system . The state of a system with respect to a given quantum reference system correctly predicts the probability distributions of any measurement on the entire reference system. This dependence of the states of quantum systems from different quantum systems that act as reference systems is viewed as a fundamental property that holds no matter whether a system is observed or not.\n5.2 Sigma algebra of interactive properties\nSimilar views have been expressed by Simon Kochen in unpublished but rather well-known notes (Kochen, 1979, preprint). In Kochen's words: \"The basic change in the classical framework which we advocate lies in dropping the assumption of the absoluteness of physical properties of interacting systems\u2026 Thus quantum mechanical properties acquire an interactive or relational character.\" Kochen uses a \u03c3-algebra formalism. Each quantum system has an associated Hilbert space. The properties of the system are established by its interaction with other quantum systems, and these properties are represented by the corresponding projection operators on the Hilbert space. These projectors are elements of a Boolean \u03c3-algebra, determined by the physics of the interaction between the two systems. Suppose a quantum system S can interact with quantum systems Q, Q\u2032,\u2026. In each case, S will acquire an interaction \u03c3-algebra of properties \u03c3(Q), \u03c3(Q\u2032) since the interaction between S and Q may be finer grained than the interaction between S and Q\u2032. Thus, interaction \u03c3-algebras may have non-trivial intersections. The family of all Boolean \u03c3-algebras forms a category, with the sets of the projectors of each \u03c3-algebra as objects. In Kochen's words: \"Just as the state of a composite system does not determine states of its components, conversely, the states of the\u2026 correlated systems do not determine the state of the composite system [\u2026] We thus resolve the measurement problem by cutting the Gordian knot tying the states of component systems uniquely to the state of the combined system.\" This is very similar in spirit to the Bene approach and to Rovelli's relational quantum mechanics, but the precise technical relation between the formalisms utilized in these approaches has not yet been analysed in full detail.\nFurther approaches at least formally related to Kochen's have been proposed by Healey (1989), who also emphasises an interactive aspect of his approach, and by Dieks (1989). See also the entry on \u2019Modal Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics\u2019.\n5.3 Quantum theory of the universe\nRelational views on quantum theory have been defended also by Lee Smolin (1995) and by Louis Crane (1995) in a cosmological context. If one is interested in the quantum theory of the entire universe, then, by definition, an external observer is not available. Breuer's theorem shows then that a quantum state of the universe, containing all correlations between all subsystems, expresses information that is not available, not even in principle, to any observer. In order to write a meaningful quantum state, argue Crane and Smolin, we have to divide the universe in two components and consider the relative quantum state predicting the outcomes of the observations that one component can make on the other.\n5.4 Relation with Everett's relative-state interpretation\nRelational ideas underlie also the interpretations of quantum theory inspired by the work of Everett. Everett\u2019 original work (Everett 1975) relies on the notion of \"relative state\" and has a marked relational tone (see quantum mechanics: Everett's relative-state formulation of ). In the context of Everettian accounts, a state may be taken as relative either (more commonly) to a \"world\", or \"branch\", or (sometimes) to the state of another system (see for instance Saunders 1996, 1998). While the first variant (relationalism with respect to branches) is far from the relational views described here, the second variant (relationalism with respect to the state of a system) is closer.\nHowever, it is different to say that something is relative to a system or that something is relative to a state of a system. Consider for instance the situation described in the example of Section 5: According to the relational interpretation, after the first measurement the quantity q has a given value and only one for O, while in Everettian terms the quantity q has a value for one state of O and a different value for another state of O, and the two are equally real. In Everett, there is an ontological multiplicity of realities, which is absent in the relational point of view, where physisical quantities are uniquely determined, once two systems are given.\nThe difference derives from a very general interpretational difference between Everettian accounts and the relational point of view. Everett (at least in its widespread version) takes the state \u03a8 as the basis of the ontology of quantum theory. The overall state \u03a8 includes different possible branches and different possible outcomes. On the other hand, the relational interpretation takes the quantum events q, that is, the actualizations of values of physical quantities, as the basic elements of reality (see Section 1.1 above) and such q's are assumed to be univocal. The relational view avoids the traditional difficulties in taking the q's as univocal simply by noticing that a q does not refer to a system, but rather to a pair of systems.\nFor a comparison between the relational interpretation and other current interpretations of quantum mechanics, see Rovelli 1996.\n6. Some consequences of the relational point of view\nA number of open conceptual issues in quantum mechanics appear in a different light when seen in the context of a relational interpretation of the theory. In particular, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations have a substantially different interpretation within the perspective of the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics. Laudisa (2001) has argued that the non-locality implied by the conventional EPR argument turns out to be frame-dependent, and this result supports the \"peaceful coexistence\" of quantum mechanics and special relativity. More radically, Rovelli and Smerlak (2006) argue that these correlations do not entail any form of \"non-locality\", when viewed in the context of this interpretation, essentially because there is a quantum event relative to an observer that happens at a spacelike separation from this observer. The abandonment of strict Einstein realism implied by the relational stance permits to reconcile quantum mechanics, completeness and locality.\nAlso, the relational interpretation allows one to give a precise definition of the time (or, better, the probability distribution of the time) at which a measurement happens, in terms of the probability distribution of the correlation between system and apparatus, as measurable by a third observer (Rovelli 1998).\nFinally, it has been suggested in (Rovelli 1997) that the relationalism at the core of quantum theory pointed out by the relational interpretations might be connected with the spatiotemporal relationalism that characterizes general relativity. Quantum mechanical relationalism is the observation that there are no absolute properties: properties of a system S are relative to another system O with which S is interacting. General relativistic relationalism is the well known observation that there is no absolute localization in spacetime: localization of an object S in spacetime is only relative to the gravitational field, or to any other object O, to which S is contiguous. There is a connection between the two, since interaction between S and O implies contiguity and contiguity between S and O can only be checked via some quantum interaction. However, because of the difficulty of developing a consistent and conceptually transparent theory of quantum gravity, so far this suggestion has not been developed beyond the stage of a simple intuition.\n7. Conclusion\nRelational interpretations of quantum mechanics propose a solution to the interpretational difficulties of quantum theory based on the idea of weakening the notions of the state of a system, event, and the idea that a system, at a certain time, may just have a certain property. The world is described as an ensemble of events (\"the electron is the point x\") which happen only relatively to a given observer. Accordingly, the state and the properties of a system are relative to another system only. There is a wide diversity in style, emphasis, and language in the authors that we have mentioned. Indeed, most of the works mentioned have developed independently from each other. But it is rather clear that there is a common idea underlying all these approaches, and the convergence is remarkable.\nWerner Heisenberg first recognized that the electron does not have a well defined position when it is not interacting. Relational interpretations push this intuition further, by stating that, even when interacting, the position of the electron is only determined in relation to a certain observer, or to a certain quantum reference system, or similar.\nIn physics, the move of deepening our insight into the physical world by relativizing notions previously used as absolute has been applied repeatedly and very successfully. Here are a few examples. The notion of the velocity of an object has been recognized as meaningless, unless it is indexed with a reference body with respect to which the object is moving. With special relativity, simultaneity of two distant events has been recognized as meaningless, unless referred to a specific state of motion of something. (This something is usually denoted as \"the observer\" without, of course, any implication that the observer is human or has any other peculiar property besides having a state of motion. Similarly, the \"observer system\" O in quantum mechanics need not to be human or have any other property beside the possibility of interacting with the \"observed\" system S.) With general relativity, the position in space and time of an object has been recognized as meaningless, unless it is referred to the gravitational field, or to some other dynamical physical entity. The move proposed by the relational interpretations of quantum mechanics has strong analogies with these, but is, in a sense, a longer jump, since all physical events and the entirety of the contingent properties of any physical system are taken to be meaningful only as relative to a second physical system. The claim of the relational interpretations is that this is not an arbitrary move. Rather, it is a conclusion which is difficult to escape, following from the observation \u2014 explained above in the example of the \"second observer\" \u2014 that a variable (of a system S) can have a well determined value q for one observer (O) and at the same time fail to have a determined value for another observer (O\u2032).\nThis way of thinking the world has certainly heavy philosophical implications. The claim of the relational interpretations is that it is nature itself that is forcing us to this way of thinking. If we want to understand nature, our task is not to frame nature into our philosophical prejudices, but rather to learn how to adjust our philosophical prejudices to what we learn from nature.\nBene, G., 1992, \"Quantum reference systems: a new framework for quantum mechanics\", Physica, A242: 529-560.\nBreuer, T., 1993, \"The impossibility of accurate state self-measurements\", Philosophy of Science, 62: 197-214.\nCrane, L., 1993, \"Clock and Category: Is Quantum Gravity Algebraic?\", Journal of Mathematical Physics, 36: 6180-6193.\nDalla Chiara, M.L., 1977, \"Logical self-reference, set theoretical paradoxes and the measurement problem in quantum mechanics\", Journal of Philosophical Logic, 6: 331-347.\nEverett H., 1957, \"\u2018Relative State\u2019 Formulation of Quantum Mechanics,\" Reviews of Modern Physics, 29: 454-462.\nDieks, D., 1989, \"Resolution of the Measurement Problem through Decoherence of the Quantum State\", Physics letters, A142: 439-446.\nHealey, R., 1989, The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics: An Interactive Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\nKochen, S., 1979, \"The interpretation of quantum mechanics\", Princeton: Princeton University Preprint.\nLaudisa, F., 2001, \"The EPR Argument in a Relational Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics\", Foundations of Physics Letters, 14: 119-132.\nMermin, N.D., 1998, \"What is quantum mechanics trying to tell us?\", American Journal of Physics, 66: 753-767.\nRovelli, C., 1996, \"Relational quantum mechanics\", International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 35: 1637-1678.\nRovelli, C., 1997, \"Half way through the woods\", in J.

Einstein's relativity,\n which is partly compatibible with quantum mechanics but is an independent idea,\n does indeed claim that the intuitions of this cultural group are wrong in some\nrespects. But I doubt that many physicists would call this intuition a\n _linguistic_ construct, even if they knew any linguistics. Einsteinian time\n differs insignificantly from Newtonian time in situations where no relative\n motions are close to the speed of light. Since all human cultures have evolved\n in environments where this is the case, I think the physicist's view would be\n that the Newtonian intuition of time is an objective description of fact,\n within the domain of typical human experience. If one tribe lived in a desert\n and another in a marsh, would one ascribe the differences in their perceptions\n of climate to linguistic factors? And in this case, all human tribes live in\n low-velocity environments.

On the other hand, the classical theory of electrodynamics, which was based on Maxwell's equations stated that light consisted of waves . Waves and particles are completely exclusive concepts in classical physics. However, one can design experiments in which both properties can be demonstrated.\nThe slit is large compared to the wavelength of the light we will not be able to differentiate between the particle and the wave picture, since in both cases we predict a broad area to be illuminated on the screen opposing the slit (perhaps with some fuzzy border where the shadow of the slit edges appears).\nIf we make the slit small enough to be comparable to the wavelength of the light (of the order of 1/2 to 1 micron), we will be able to distinguish between the wave and particle picture. The experiment clearly shows an interference pattern on the screen, which is predicted from the wave picture. The particle picture would predict just a narrow illuminated region on the screen which is not observed.\nThe Double Slit Experiment:\nAnother way to demonstrate the wave nature of light is the double slit experiment . There, two narrow slits are placed next to each other with a distance of the order of the wavelength of the light. The particle picture would predict just two narrow beams of light passing through the slits and illuminating two narrow strips on the screen, while the wave picture predicts an interference pattern with a main maximum in the center (between the slits) and several higher order maxima to either side. The experiment proofs the wave picture to be correct.\nThese interference experiments proof that light consists of electromagnetic waves! What else is there to proof? Particles and waves are mutually exclusive, or are they?\nThe Photoelectric Effect :\nAs we have seen in the previous chapter, the photoelectric effect proofs that light consists of photons. Can we now set up a single experiment that proofs at the same time that light is both particles and waves?\nThe way to do this is to use the photoelectric effect to detect the light particles as they arrive at the screen. Instead of a screen we will set up an array of little photomultiplier cells (photodiodes can also be used) which we can read out electronically. They will count the number of detected photons, and tell us where and at which time a photon is registered. The number of photons registered at a given spot can then be used to calculate the intensity of the light at that particular spot on the screen. We can then recreate the single slit experiment with single photon detection . In order to measure one single photon at a time we have to turn down the intensity of our light source to such a level that only one photon is on its way through the slit at any given time. The numbers of photons registered in each channel of the array reflects exactly the distribution of the intensity we expect from the interference experiment using waves. Yet we can detect and count each individual light particle separately.\nWe have thus set up an experiment that proofs at the same time that light consists of particles (because we can count them individually) and of waves (since the intensity distribution at the detector array reflects the interference pattern). When we pass just one photon through the slit at a time we find that in some mysterious way the photon interferes with itself and changes its direction of flight. While it is impossible to predict where exactly it will hit the detector array, one can say that its probability is high to hit at the maxima of the interference pattern.\nThe Davisson-Germer Experiment :\nSince light comes in the form of waves and particles at the same time, could it be possible that material particles (like electrons, protons, etc.) may also have a wavelike nature at the same time? De Broglie, a French physicist predicted this in his famous hypothesis, and related the wavelength of the material particle to its linear momentum, p, by:\nProof of this relation was obtained in 1926 by the Davisson-Germer experiment . It is a type of interference experiment. If one wants to perform an interference experiment with electrons this would not be possible with a mechanical set-up. The slit-width would have to be too narrow to be able to manufacture since according to de Broglie's relation the electronic wavelength is of the order of a few Angstroms (even for slow electrons). The solution was to use a single crystal (Davisson and Germer used a Ni crystal) and use the periodic Coulomb potential the crystal lattice presents for the electron to do the interference experiment. In the actual set-up an electron beam was collimated onto the surface of the Ni crystal and the reflected electrons measured by a detector at a variable angle with respect to the incoming electron beam. While most of the electrons were scattered back at theta=0 (main maximum) a higher order maximum was obtained at a certain angle theta which proofed the existence of an interference pattern predicted from the wavelike nature of the electrons.\nThe Wavefunction:\nDue to the particle-wave duality we are now faced with the problem how to correctly set up a theory that describes the motion of a light or material particle. Classical mechanics would not help since its equations of motions are exclusively valid for particles. Classical electrodynamics is exclusively valid for waves. A new concept had to be born, and was formulated by Schr&oumldinger in his wave equation.\nThe microscopic particle was described by a so-called wavefunction. The significance of the wavefunction is that its absolute square described the probability function to find the particle at any given location in space. Schr&oumldinger's equation is an equation of motion for the wavefunction.\nOne important feature of the wavefunction is that it can be superimposed with itself and with other wavefunctions the same way that electromagnetic waves can interfere with each other. This allows for the single photon to interfere with itself, but also allows for a single electron to split itself up in a linear combination of wavefunctions.\nThe interference of waves can be illustrated in a number of simple graphs: When two waves of different wavelength interfere they will produce a wave with a new wavelength which is just the average of the two old wavelengths, and an envelope with the difference wavelength. An acoustic example would be the beating that one can hear when two instruments produce sounds of slightly different frequencies. In trying to tune in to a given standard frequency the musician will listen to the beating of the two sounds and tune his instrument such that the beating periods get longer and longer until they vanish in the case of perfect consonance.\nIn the case of multiple frequencies superimposed on each other the resulting pattern yields a (periodic) main maximum with lower amplitudes before and after it.\nThis can be extended to very many different frequencies , combining together to form a so-called wave packet . The wave packet can be viewed as a model for creating a particle out of waves (although there are some serious theoretical shortcomings, and this picture may not be carried through completely). A particle with high kinetic energy would then be represented by a linear combination of waves with high frequency and thus show a low width of its associated wave packet, while a low energy particle would have a relatively broad width due to the dominant contribution of low frequency waves.\n"}, {"score": 2383.4434, "uuid": "a561219a-90d3-53d2-a814-0efb0cfbf6c7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0011wb-02-18737", "target_hostname": "physics.about.com", "target_uri": "http://physics.about.com/b/2010/04/01/the-abuse-of-quantum-physics-and-the-possibility-of-quantum-consciousness.htm", "page_rank": 1.1846643e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>The</em> Abuse of <em>Quantum</em> <em>Physics</em>, <em>and</em> <em>the</em> Possibility of <em>Quantum</em> Consciousness", "snippet": "I believe that, though Think <em>and</em> Grow Rich discusses \u201c<em>The</em> Secret,\u201d it never actually identifies <em>what</em> <em>the</em> secret <em>is</em>, <em>and</em> I don\u2019t recall if it actually tries to invoke any <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em> as support of this (of course, <em>quantum</em> <em>physics</em> wasn\u2019t as well known to <em>the</em> general public at <em>the</em> time it was written", "explanation": null, "document": "Twitter\nI have a confession to make. I recently read The Secret (well, actually, I listened to it on CD) and I liked it, a lot. I found it motivational, empowering, and actually useful. I'm similarly fond of the work of people such as Wayne Dyer and Deepak Chopra. In fact, I'm pretty much a fan of the whole self-help, self-empowerment, and positive psychology movement.\nHowever, this doesn't mean that any of these people know a bit of what they're talking about when they get into the realm of quantum physics. Usually it is far from it ...\nSo how can I like them?\nWell, I suppose it goes back to a difference discussed by Lee Smolin in The Trouble with Physics, between an \"effective theory\" and a \"fundamental theory.\" An effective theory, though it may be useful, doesn't necessarily describe the actual behavior of reality the way a fundamental theory does.\nTake the motivational film (or book) The Secret. For those who aren't familiar with The Secret, it basically puts forward the idea of a \"Law of Attraction\" which draws to you the things that you think about really hard. By thinking hard about things, and being determined that you will get them, they are mystically drawn to you, according to this \"Law of Attraction.\"\nNow, as an effective theory, I think this is perfectly fine. Why? Because consider the alternative - you don't want something very much, and you don't think about it that much, let alone take any active steps toward bringing it into your life. What's the likelihood that you're going to get that thing? Pretty much nil, is my experience.\nSo while the statement \"The things I think about come into my life\" may not always be true, the opposite statement \"The things I don't think about don't come into my life\" is a lot more likely to be true. (Especially when the \"things\" are material, such as money, because very few people become accidental millionaires.)\nTherefore, with all things being equal, I consider it useful to be positive, to focus a lot of attention on what I want, and to act in a manner that is consistent with the idea that I will eventually get them. Because doing the opposite does, I think, reduce your chance of getting the things you want. And there's ample evidence to suggest that this sort of thinking does help keep you stress free, healthy, and in better relationships.\nBut the writers of The Secret go further than this, describing this not just as a good effective theory, but as the single most fundamental law of the universe ... and then they try to cite quantum physics (and other physics ideas) to support this claim. And that's where I run into problems, because they usually do so badly ... even when bringing in people with actual physics degrees to support the idea.\nConsider a recent ABC Nightline Face-Off between spiritualists Deepak Chopra and Jean Houston against professional skeptics Michael Shermer and Sam Harris. In this discussion, Chopra continually refers back to concepts such as the fact that all matter is energy and quantum non-locality as proof of some of his claims, even though he doesn't seem to grasp that when physicists use these terms, they mean them in very specific ways. (The Secret makes similar statements.) Note that Chopra is not claiming that the common physics interpretation is incorrect or incomplete ... he seems to genuinely believe that the physicists in the audience will agree when he says all things in the universe are interconnected and that a conscious observer is necessary.\nWell, physicists don't agree on that. Don't get me wrong - some active, working, professional physicists do believe in these things. But it is not the mainstream belief. Most physicists believe that these fundamental quantum mechanical concepts break down on their own above a certain point, which Chopra seems to be completely unaware of. (The majority consensus among physicists is a principle called decoherence, where the quantum behaviors collapse when a system reaches a certain level of complexity ... so quantum principles just don't apply to systems larger than an atom or so.)\nThis sort of vague discussion, where the lines between science and spirituality, the physical world and the inner realm of consciousness, gets even more muddied when you wade into the thick waters surrounding the concept of \"quantum consciousness.\" This is the idea that the mental processes of consciousness cannot be explained by normal information processing science. Instead, consciousness may actually be the product of information processed by quantum information theory , and mimic the operation of quantum computers .\nTwo intriguing discussions of this subject are being carried out across the blogosphere - one on the Huffington Post by information theorist Ervin Laszlo and the other on NPR's 13.7 by biologist Stuart Kauffman. These discussions are much more precise, without quite the level of \"woo-woo\" that Deepak Chopra goes into.\nOne key thing to keep in mind, though, is that even professional physicists get into trouble when they try to take the solid concepts of the laboratory and discuss them in language that can be misconstrued by others. Consider the recent statement from physicist Michio Kaku that the Large Hadron Collider is soon going to be \" unraveling Genesis Chapter 1 Verse 1 \" ... no, it'll be just as raveled after the experiment as it is now.\nSince quantum consciousness is still such an early subject, everyone who talks about the subject is stepping a bit outside of their areas of certainty ... so it, too, will likely remain quite muddled as well. As Sam Harris points out when Chopra brings up Roger Penrose (one of the originators of the idea of quantum consciousness), the idea has more detractors than could fill the hall they're speaking in.\nRelated Articles:\nDigitalJournal - ABC Nightline Face-Off, \"Does God Have a Future\"\u00a0Pt 1: Deepak Chopra says \"It's Time to Upgrade Science\"\nDigitalJournal - ABC Nightline Face-Off, \"Does God Have a Future\"\u00a0Pt 2: The \"Scheme\" of Religion\nDigitalJournal - ABC Nightline Face-Off, \"Does God Have a Future\"\u00a0Pt 3: Deepak Resents Credentials Questions\nDigitalJournal - ABC Nightline Face-Off, \"Does God Have a Future\"\u00a0Pt 4: Stop Using \"Fuzzy Words\"\nDigitalJournal - ABC Nightline Face-Off , \"Does God Have a Future\" Pt 5: The Story is Changing\nDigitalJournal - ABC Nightline Face-Off, \"Does God Have a Future\"\u00a0Pt 6: Science Can Explain Life\nDigitalJournal - ABC Nightline Face-Off, \"Does God Have a Future\"\u00a0Pt 7: Sam Harris and Deepak Chopra on God's Existence\nDigitalJournal - ABC Nightline Face-Off, \"Does God Have a Future\"\u00a0Pt 8: Spirituality is Not Going Away\n"}, {"score": 2380.0752, "uuid": "fd1cfd40-6a70-5374-b0a2-268e15971013", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1716wb-35-26403", "target_hostname": "utubersity.com", "target_uri": "http://utubersity.com/?page_id=750", "page_rank": 1.1951234e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "NPTEL- Introduction to <em>Quantum</em> <em>Physics</em> | Utubersity.com", "snippet": "<em>The</em> Periodic Table: Its Story <em>and</em> Its Significance.

Quantum mechanics departs from classical mechanics primarily at the quantum realm of atomic and subatomic length scales. QM provides a mathematical description of much of the dual particle-like and wave-like behavior and interactions of energy and matter.\nIn advanced topics of quantum mechanics, some of these behaviors are macroscopic and only emerge at extreme (i.e., very low or very high) energies or temperatures. The name quantum mechanics derives from the observation that some physical quantities can change only in discrete amounts (Latin quanta), and not in a continuous (cf. analog) way. For example, the angular momentum of an electron bound to an atom or molecule is quantized.[1] In the context of quantum mechanics, the wave\u2013particle duality of energy and matter and the uncertainty principle provide a unified view of the behavior of photons, electrons, and other atomic-scale objects.\nThe mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are abstract. A mathematical function called the wavefunction provides information about the probability amplitude of position, momentum, and other physical properties of a particle. Mathematical manipulations of the wavefunction usually involve the bra-ket notation, which requires an understanding of complex numbers and linear functionals. The wavefunction treats the object as a quantum harmonic oscillator, and the mathematics is akin to that describing acoustic resonance. Many of the results of quantum mechanics are not easily visualized in terms of classical mechanics - for instance, the ground state in a quantum mechanical model is a non-zero energy state that is the lowest permitted energy state of a system, as opposed a more \"traditional\" system that is thought of as simply being at rest, with zero kinetic energy. Instead of a traditional static, unchanging zero state, quantum mechanics allows for far more dynamic, chaotic possibilities, according to John Wheeler.\nThe earliest versions of quantum mechanics were formulated in the first decade of the 20th century. At around the same time, the atomic theory and the corpuscular theory of light (as updated by Einstein) first came to be widely accepted as scientific fact; these latter theories can be viewed as quantum theories of matter and electromagnetic radiation, respectively. Early quantum theory was significantly reformulated in the mid-1920s by Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Wolfgang Pauli and their collaborators, and the Copenhagen interpretation of Niels Bohr became widely accepted. By 1930, quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by the work of Paul Dirac and John von Neumann, with a greater emphasis placed on measurement in quantum mechanics, the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality, and philosophical speculation about the role of the observer. Quantum mechanics has since branched out into almost every aspect of 20th century physics and other disciplines, such as quantum chemistry, quantum electronics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. Much 19th century physics has been re-evaluated as the \"classical limit\" of quantum mechanics, and its more advanced developments in terms of quantum field theory, string theory, and speculative quantum gravity theories.\nContents\n3 Mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics\n4 Interactions with other scientific theories\n4.1 Quantum mechanics and classical physics\n4.2 Relativity and quantum mechanics\n4.3 Attempts at a unified field theory\n5 Philosophical implications\n7.4 Particle in a box\n7.5 Finite potential well\nHistory\nMain article: History of quantum mechanics\nThe history of quantum mechanics dates back to the 1838 discovery of cathode rays by Michael Faraday. This was followed by the 1859 statement of the black body radiation problem by Gustav Kirchhoff, the 1877 suggestion by Ludwig Boltzmann that the energy states of a physical system can be discrete, and the 1900 quantum hypothesis of Max Planck.[2] Planck's hypothesis that energy is radiated and absorbed in discrete \"quanta\" (or \"energy elements\") precisely matched the observed patterns of blackbody radiation. According to Planck, each energy element E is proportional to its frequency \u03bd:\nwhere h is Planck's constant. Planck (cautiously) insisted that this was simply an aspect of the processes of absorption and emission of radiation and had nothing to do with the physical reality of the radiation itself.[3] However, in 1905 Albert Einstein interpreted Planck's quantum hypothesis realistically and used it to explain the photoelectric effect, in which shining light on certain materials can eject electrons from the material.\nThe 1927 Solvay Conference in Brussels.\nThe foundations of quantum mechanics were established during the first half of the 20th century by Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, Louis de Broglie, Albert Einstein, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Max Born, John von Neumann, Paul Dirac, Wolfgang Pauli, David Hilbert, and others. In the mid-1920s, developments in quantum mechanics led to its becoming the standard formulation for atomic physics. In the summer of 1925, Bohr and Heisenberg published results that closed the \"Old Quantum Theory\". Out of deference to their particle-like behavior in certain processes and measurements, light quanta came to be called photons (1926). From Einstein's simple postulation was born a flurry of debating, theorizing, and testing. Thus the entire field of quantum physics emerged, leading to its wider acceptance at the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927.\nThe other exemplar that led to quantum mechanics was the study of electromagnetic waves, such as visible light. When it was found in 1900 by Max Planck that the energy of waves could be described as consisting of small packets or \"quanta\", Albert Einstein further developed this idea to show that an electromagnetic wave such as light could be described as a particle (later called the photon) with a discrete quantum of energy that was dependent on its frequency.[4] This led to a theory of unity between subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves, called wave\u2013particle duality, in which particles and waves were neither one nor the other, but had certain properties of both.\nWhile quantum mechanics traditionally described the world of the very small, it is also needed to explain certain recently investigated macroscopic systems such as superconductors and superfluids.\nThe word quantum derives from the Latin, meaning \"how great\" or \"how much\".[5] In quantum mechanics, it refers to a discrete unit that quantum theory assigns to certain physical quantities, such as the energy of an atom at rest (see Figure 1). The discovery that particles are discrete packets of energy with wave-like properties led to the branch of physics dealing with atomic and sub-atomic systems which is today called quantum mechanics. It is the underlying mathematical framework of many fields of physics and chemistry, including condensed matter physics, solid-state physics, atomic physics, molecular physics, computational physics, computational chemistry, quantum chemistry, particle physics, nuclear chemistry, and nuclear physics.[6] Some fundamental aspects of the theory are still actively studied[7]\nQuantum mechanics is essential to understanding the behavior of systems at atomic length scales and smaller. For example, if classical mechanics truly governed the workings of an atom, electrons would rapidly travel toward, and collide with, the nucleus, making stable atoms impossible. However, in the natural world electrons normally remain in an uncertain, non-deterministic, \"smeared\", probabilistic wave\u2013particle wavefunction orbital path around (or through) the nucleus, defying classical electromagnetism.[8]\nQuantum mechanics was initially developed to provide a better explanation of the atom, especially the differences in the spectra of light emitted by different isotopes of the same element. The quantum theory of the atom was developed as an explanation for the electron remaining in its orbit, which could not be explained by Newton's laws of motion and Maxwell's laws of (classical) electromagnetism.\nBroadly speaking, quantum mechanics incorporates four classes of phenomena for which classical physics cannot account:\nThe quantization of certain physical properties\nWave\u2013particle duality\nMain article: Mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics\nSee also: Quantum logic\nIn the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics developed by Paul Dirac[9] and John von Neumann,[10] the possible states of a quantum mechanical system are represented by unit vectors (called \"state vectors\"). Formally, these reside in a complex separable Hilbert space - variously called the \"state space\" or the \"associated Hilbert space\" of the system - that is well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the projective space of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system - for example, the state space for position and momentum states is the space of square-integrable functions, while the state space for the spin of a single proton is just the product of two complex planes. Each observable is represented by a maximally Hermitian (precisely: by a self-adjoint) linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. If the operator's spectrum is discrete, the observable can only attain those discrete eigenvalues.\nIn the formalism of quantum mechanics, the state of a system at a given time is described by a complex wave function, also referred to as state vector in a complex vector space.[11] This abstract mathematical object allows for the calculation of probabilities of outcomes of concrete experiments. For example, it allows one to compute the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus at a particular time. Contrary to classical mechanics, one can never make simultaneous predictions of conjugate variables, such as position and momentum, with accuracy. For instance, electrons may be considered (to a certain probability) to be located somewhere within a given region of space, but with their exact positions unknown. Contours of constant probability, often referred to as \"clouds\", may be drawn around the nucleus of an atom to conceptualize where the electron might be located with the most probability. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle quantifies the inability to precisely locate the particle given its conjugate momentum.[12]\nAccording to one interpretation, as the result of a measurement the wave function containing the probability information for a system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator representing the observable\u00a0\u2014 which explains the choice of Hermitian operators, for which all the eigenvalues are real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is represented by the statement that the operators corresponding to certain observables do not commute.\nThe probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement. This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand. It was the central topic in the famous Bohr-Einstein debates, in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of thought experiments. In the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a \"measurement\" has been extensively studied. Newer interpretations of quantum mechanics have been formulated that do away with the concept of \"wavefunction collapse\" (see, for example, the relative state interpretation). The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wavefunctions become entangled, so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity. For details, see the article on measurement in quantum mechanics.[13]\nGenerally, quantum mechanics does not assign definite values. Instead, it makes a prediction using a probability distribution; that is, it describes the probability of obtaining the possible outcomes from measuring an observable. Often these results are skewed by many causes, such as dense probability clouds. Probability clouds are approximate, but better than the Bohr model, whereby electron location is given by a probability function, the wave function eigenvalue, such that the probability is the squared modulus of the complex amplitude, or quantum state nuclear attraction.[14][15] Naturally, these probabilities will depend on the quantum state at the \"instant\" of the measurement. Hence, uncertainty is involved in the value. There are, however, certain states that are associated with a definite value of a particular observable. These are known as eigenstates of the observable (\"eigen\" can be translated from German as meaning \"inherent\" or \"characteristic\").[16]\nIn the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of everything (every observable) as being in an eigenstate. Everything appears to have a definite position, a definite momentum, a definite energy, and a definite time of occurrence. However, quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values of a particle's position and momentum (since they are conjugate pairs) or its energy and time (since they too are conjugate pairs); rather, it only provides a range of probabilities of where that particle might be given its momentum and momentum probability. Therefore, it is helpful to use different words to describe states having uncertain values and states having definite values (eigenstates). Usually, a system will not be in an eigenstate of the observable (particle) we are interested in. However, if one measures the observable, the wavefunction will instantaneously be an eigenstate (or \"generalized\" eigenstate) of that observable. This process is known as wavefunction collapse, a controversial and much-debated process[17] that involves expanding the system under study to include the measurement device. If one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement, one will be able to compute the probability of the wavefunction collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates. For example, the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wavefunction that is a wave packet centered around some mean position x0 (neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum). When one measures the position of the particle, it is impossible to predict with certainty the result.[13] It is probable, but not certain, that it will be near x0, where the amplitude of the wave function is large. After the measurement is performed, having obtained some result x, the wave function collapses into a position eigenstate centered at x.[18]\nThe time evolution of a quantum state is described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, in which the Hamiltonian (the operator corresponding to the total energy of the system) generates the time evolution. The time evolution of wave functions is deterministic in the sense that - given a wavefunction at an initial time - it makes a definite prediction of what the wavefunction will be at any later time.[19]\nDuring a measurement, on the other hand, the change of the initial wavefunction into another, later wavefunction is not deterministic, it is unpredictable (i.e. random). A time-evolution simulation can be seen here.[20][21]\nWave functions change as time progresses. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes how wavefunctions change in time, playing a role similar to Newton's second law in classical mechanics. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation, applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle, predicts that the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity (like a classical particle with no forces acting on it). However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more uncertain with time. This also has the effect of turning a position eigenstate (which can be thought of as an infinitely sharp wave packet) into a broadened wave packet that no longer represents a (definite, certain) position eigenstate.[22]\nFig. 1: Probability densities corresponding to the wavefunctions of an electron in a hydrogen atom possessing definite energy levels (increasing from the top of the image to the bottom: n = 1, 2, 3, ...) and angular momenta (increasing across from left to right: s, p, d, ...). Brighter areas correspond to higher probability density in a position measurement. Wavefunctions like these are directly comparable to Chladni's figures of acoustic modes of vibration in classical physics, and are indeed modes of oscillation as well, possessing a sharp energy and, thus, a definite frequency. The angular momentum and energy are quantized, and take only discrete values like those shown (as is the case for resonant frequencies in acoustics)\nSome wave functions produce probability distributions that are constant, or independent of time - such as when in a stationary state of constant energy, time vanishes in the absolute square of the wave function. Many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such \"static\" wave functions. For example, a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus, whereas in quantum mechanics it is described by a static, spherically symmetric wavefunction surrounding the nucleus (Fig. 1) (note, however, that only the lowest angular momentum states, labeled s, are spherically symmetric).[23]\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation acts on the entire probability amplitude, not merely its absolute value. Whereas the absolute value of the probability amplitude encodes information about probabilities, its phase encodes information about the interference between quantum states. This gives rise to the \"wave-like\" behavior of quantum states. As it turns out, analytic solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation are only available for a very small number of relatively simple model Hamiltonians, of which the quantum harmonic oscillator, the particle in a box, the hydrogen molecular ion, and the hydrogen atom are the most important representatives. Even the helium atom - which contains just one more electron than does the hydrogen atom - has defied all attempts at a fully analytic treatment.\nThere exist several techniques for generating approximate solutions, however. In the important method known as perturbation theory, one uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to generate a result for a more complicated model that is related to the simpler model by (for one example) the addition of a weak potential energy. Another method is the \"semi-classical equation of motion\" approach, which applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces only weak (small) deviations from classical behavior. These deviations can then be computed based on the classical motion. This approach is particularly important in the field of quantum chaos.\nMathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics\nThere are numerous mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics. One of the oldest and most commonly used formulations is the \"transformation theory\" proposed by the late Cambridge theoretical physicist Paul Dirac, which unifies and generalizes the two earliest formulations of quantum mechanics - matrix mechanics (invented by Werner Heisenberg)[24] and wave mechanics (invented by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger).[25]\nEspecially since Werner Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932 for the creation of quantum mechanics, the role of Max Born in the development of QM has become somewhat confused and overlooked. A 2005 biography of Born details his role as the creator of the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. This fact was recognized in a paper that Heisenberg himself published in 1940 honoring Max Planck.[26] and In the matrix formulation, the instantaneous state of a quantum system encodes the probabilities of its measurable properties, or \"observables\". Examples of observables include energy, position, momentum, and angular momentum. Observables can be either continuous (e.g., the position of a particle) or discrete (e.g., the energy of an electron bound to a hydrogen atom).[27] An alternative formulation of quantum mechanics is Feynman's path integral formulation, in which a quantum-mechanical amplitude is considered as a sum over all possible histories between the initial and final states. This is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the action principle in classical mechanics.\nInteractions with other scientific theories\nThe rules of quantum mechanics are fundamental. They assert that the state space of a system is a Hilbert space, and that observables of that system are Hermitian operators acting on that space - although they do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators. These can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system. An important guide for making these choices is the correspondence principle, which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical mechanics when a system moves to higher energies or - equivalently - larger quantum numbers, i.e. whereas a single particle exhibits a degree of randomness, in systems incorporating millions of particles averaging takes over and, at the high energy limit, the statistical probability of random behaviour approaches zero. In other words, classical mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large systems. This \"high energy\" limit is known as the classical or correspondence limit. One can even start from an established classical model of a particular system, then attempt to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit.\nUnsolved problems in physics\nIn the correspondence limit of quantum mechanics: Is there a preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics? How does the quantum description of reality, which includes elements such as the \"superposition of states\" and \"wavefunction collapse\", give rise to the reality we perceive?\nWhen quantum mechanics was originally formulated, it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was non-relativistic classical mechanics. For instance, the well-known model of the quantum harmonic oscillator uses an explicitly non-relativistic expression for the kinetic energy of the oscillator, and is thus a quantum version of the classical harmonic oscillator.\nEarly attempts to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved the replacement of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a covariant equation such as the Klein-Gordon equation or the Dirac equation. While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles. A fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of quantum field theory, which applies quantization to a field (rather than a fixed set of particles). The first complete quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics, provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction. The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems. A simpler approach, one that has been employed since the inception of quantum mechanics, is to treat charged particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical electromagnetic field. For example, the elementary quantum model of the hydrogen atom describes the electric field of the hydrogen atom using a classical\nCoulomb potential. This \"semi-classical\" approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role, such as in the emission of photonss by charged particles.\nQuantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons. The weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak theory), by the physicists Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg. These three men shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for this work.[28]\nIt has proven difficult to construct quantum models of gravity, the remaining fundamental force. Semi-classical approximations are workable, and have led to predictions such as Hawking radiation. However, the formulation of a complete theory of quantum gravity is hindered by apparent incompatibilities between general relativity (the most accurate theory of gravity currently known) and some of the fundamental assumptions of quantum theory. The resolution of these incompatibilities is an area of active research, and theories such as string theory are among the possible candidates for a future theory of quantum gravity.\nClassical mechanics has also been extended into the complex domain, with complex classical mechanics exhibiting behaviors similar to quantum mechanics.[29]\nQuantum mechanics and classical physics\nPredictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy. According to the correspondence principle between classical and quantum mechanics, all objects obey the laws of quantum mechanics, and classical mechanics is just an approximation for large systems of objects (or a statistical quantum mechanics of a large collection of particles). The laws of classical mechanics thus follow from the laws of quantum mechanics as a statistical average at the limit of large systems or large quantum numbers.[30] However, chaotic systems do not have good quantum numbers, and quantum chaos studies the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions in these systems.\nQuantum coherence is an essential difference between classical and quantum theories, and is illustrated by the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. Quantum interference involves adding together probability amplitudes, whereas classical \"waves\" infer that there is an adding together of intensities. For microscopic bodies, the extension of the system is much smaller than the coherence length, which gives rise to long-range entanglement and other nonlocal phenomena that are characteristic of quantum systems.[31] Quantum coherence is not typically evident at macroscopic scales - although an exception to this rule can occur at extremely low temperatures (i.e. approaching absolute zero), when quantum behavior can manifest itself on more macroscopic scales (see macroscopic quantum phenomena, Bose-Einstein condensate, and Quantum machine). This is in accordance with the following observations:\nMany macroscopic properties of a classical system are a direct consequence of the quantum behavior of its parts. For example, the stability of bulk matter (which consists of atoms and molecules which would quickly collapse under electric forces alone), the rigidity of solids, and the mechanical, thermal, chemical, optical and magnetic properties of matter are all results of the interaction of electric charges under the rules of quantum mechanics.[32]\nWhile the seemingly \"exotic\" behavior of matter posited by quantum mechanics and relativity theory become more apparent when dealing with particles of extremely small size or velocities approaching the speed of light, the laws of classical Newtonian physics remain accurate in predicting the behavior of the vast majority of \"large\" objects (on the order of the size of large molecules or bigger) at velocities much smaller than the velocity of light.[33]\nRelativity and quantum mechanics\nMain articles: Quantum gravity and Theory of everything\nEven with the defining postulates of both Einstein's theory of general relativity and quantum theory being indisputably supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence and while they do not directly contradict each other theoretically (at least with regard to their primary claims), they have proven extremely difficult to being incorporated within one consistent, cohesive model.[34]\nEinstein himself is well known for rejecting some of the claims of quantum mechanics. While clearly contributing to the field, he did not accept many of the more \"philosophical consequences and interpretations\" of quantum mechanics, such as the lack of deterministic causality. He is famously quoted as saying, in response to this aspect, \"My God does not play with dice\". He also had difficulty with the assertion that a single subatomic particle can occupy numerous areas of space at one time. However, he was also the first to notice some of the apparently exotic consequences of entanglement, and used them to formulate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox in the hope of showing that quantum mechanics had unacceptable implications. This was 1935, but in 1964 it was shown by John Bell (see Bell inequality) that - although Einstein was correct in identifying seemingly paradoxical implications of quantum mechanical nonlocality - these implications could be experimentally tested. Alain Aspect's initial experiments in 1982, and many subsequent experiments since, have definitively verified quantum entanglement.\nAccording to the paper of J. Bell and the Copenhagen interpretation - the common interpretation of quantum mechanics by physicists since 1927 - and contrary to Einstein's ideas, quantum mechanics was not, at the same time:\na \"realistic\" theory\nand\na local theory.\nThe Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox shows in any case that there exist experiments by which one can measure the state of one particle and instantaneously change the state of its entangled partner - although the two particles can be an arbitrary distance apart. However, this effect does not violate causality, since no transfer of information happens. Quantum entanglement forms the basis of quantum cryptography, which is used in high-security commercial applications in banking and government.\nGravity is negligible in many areas of particle physics, so that unification between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not an urgent issue in those particular applications. However, the lack of a correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in cosmology and the search by physicists for an elegant \"Theory of Everything\" (TOE). Consequently, resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th and 21st century physics. Many prominent physicists, including Stephen Hawking, have labored for many years in the attempt to discover a theory underlying everything. This TOE would combine not only the different models of subatomic physics, but also derive the four fundamental forces of nature - the strong force, electromagnetism, the weak force, and gravity - from a single force or phenomenon. While Stephen Hawking was initially a believer in the Theory of Everything, after considering G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem, he has concluded that one is not obtainable, and has stated so publicly in his lecture \"G\u00f6del and the End of Physics\" (2002).[35] One of the leading authorities continuing the search for a coherent TOE is Edward Witten, a theoretical physicist who formulated the groundbreaking M-theory, which is an attempt at describing the supersymmetrical based string theory. M-theory posits that our apparent 4-dimensional spacetime is, in reality, actually an 11-dimensional spacetime containing 10 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension, although 7 of the spatial dimensions are - at lower energies - completely \"compactified\" (or infinitely curved) and not readily amenable to measurement or probing.\nAttempts at a unified field theory\nMain article: Grand unified theory\nThe quest to unify the fundamental forces through quantum mechanics is still ongoing. Quantum electrodynamics (or \"quantum electromagnetism\"), which is currently (in the perturbative regime at least) the most accurately tested physical theory,[36][unreliable source](blog) has been successfully merged with the weak nuclear force into the electroweak force and work is currently being done to merge the electroweak and strong force into the electrostrong force. Current predictions state that at around 1014 GeV the three aforementioned forces are fused into a single unified field,[37] Beyond this \"grand unification,\" it is speculated that it may be possible to merge gravity with the other three gauge symmetries, expected to occur at roughly 1019 GeV. However\u00a0\u2014 and while special relativity is parsimoniously incorporated into quantum electrodynamics\u00a0\u2014 the expanded general relativity, currently the best theory describing the gravitation force, has not been fully incorporated into quantum theory.\nPhilosophical implications\nMain article: Interpretations of quantum mechanics\nSince its inception, the many counter-intuitive aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debates and many interpretations. Even fundamental issues, such as Max Born's basic rules concerning probability amplitudes and probability distributions took decades to be appreciated by society and many leading scientists. Indeed, the renown physicist Richard Feynman once said, \"I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.\"[38]\nThe Copenhagen interpretation - due largely to the Danish theoretical physicist Niels Bohr - remains the quantum mechanical formalism that is currently most widely accepted amongst physicists, some 75 years after its enunciation. According to this interpretation, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but instead must be considered a final renunciation of the classical idea of \"causality\". It is also believed therein that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the complementarity nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations.\nAlbert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, disliked this loss of determinism in measurement. Einstein held that there should be a local hidden variable theory underlying quantum mechanics and, consequently, that the present theory was incomplete. He produced a series of objections to the theory, the most famous of which has become known as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. John Bell showed that this \"EPR\" paradox led to experimentally testable differences between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories. Experiments have been performed confirming the accuracy of quantum mechanics, thereby demonstrating that the physical world cannot be described by any local realistic theory.[39] The Bohr-Einstein debates provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an epistemological point of view.\nThe Everett many-worlds interpretation, formulated in 1956, holds that all the possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes.[40] This is not accomplished by introducing some \"new axiom\" to quantum mechanics, but on the contrary, by removing the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet. All of the possible consistent states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus (including the observer) are present in a real physical - not just formally mathematical, as in other interpretations - quantum superposition. Such a superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an entangled state. While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we can observe only the universe (i.e., the consistent state contribution to the aforementioned superposition) that we, as observers, inhabit. Everett's interpretation is perfectly consistent with John Bell's experiments and makes them intuitively understandable. However, according to the theory of quantum decoherence, these \"parallel universes\" will never be accessible to us. The inaccessibility can be understood as follows: once a measurement is done, the measured system becomes entangled with both the physicist who measured it and a huge number of other particles, some of which are photons flying away at the speed of light towards the other end of the universe. In order to prove that the wave function did not collapse, one would have to bring all these particles back and measure them again, together with the system that was originally measured. Not only is this completely impractical, but even if one could theoretically do this, it would destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place (to include the physicist's memory).[citation needed]\nApplications\nQuantum mechanics had enormous[41] success in explaining many of the features of our world. The individual behaviors of the subatomic particles that make up all forms of matter (elections, protons, neutrons, photons, and others) can often only be satisfactorily described using quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics has strongly influenced string theories, candidates for a Theory of Everything (see reductionism), and the multiverse hypotheses.\nQuantum mechanics is also critically important for understanding how individual atoms combine covalently to form molecules. The application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is known as quantum chemistry. Relativistic quantum mechanics can, in principle, mathematically describe most of chemistry. Quantum mechanics can also provide quantitative insight into ionic and covalent bonding processes by explicitly showing which molecules are energetically favorable to which others, and the magnitudes of the energies involved.[42] Furthermore, most of the calculations performed in modern computational chemistry rely on quantum mechanics.[43]\nA working mechanism of a resonant tunneling diode device, based on the phenomenon of quantum tunneling through potential barriers\nA great deal of modern technological inventions operate at a scale where quantum effects are significant. Examples include the laser, the transistor (and thus the microchip), the electron microscope, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study of semiconductors led to the invention of the diode and the transistor, which are indispensable parts of modern electronics systems and devices.\nResearchers are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating quantum states. Efforts are being made to more fully develop quantum cryptography, which will theoretically allow guaranteed secure transmission of information. A more distant goal is the development of quantum computers, which are expected to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical computers. Another active research topic is quantum teleportation, which deals with techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances.\nQuantum tunneling is vital to the operation of many devices - even in the simple light switch, as otherwise the electrons in the electric current could not penetrate the potential barrier made up of a layer of oxide. Flash memory chips found in USB drives use quantum tunneling to erase their memory cells.\nWhile quantum mechanics primarily applies to the atomic regimes of matter and energy, some systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects on a large scale - superfluidity, the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near absolute zero, is one well-known example. Quantum theory also provides accurate descriptions for many previously unexplained phenomena, such as black body radiation and the stability of the orbitals of electrons in atoms. It has also given insight into the workings of many different biological systems, including smell receptors and protein structures.[44] Recent work on photosynthesis has provided evidence that quantum correlations play an essential role in this basic fundamental process of the plant kingdom.[45] Even so, classical physics can often provide good approximations to results otherwise obtained by quantum physics, typically in circumstances with large numbers of particles or large quantum numbers.\nExamples\nFree particle\nFor example, consider a free particle. In quantum mechanics, there is wave-particle duality, so the properties of the particle can be described as the properties of a wave. Therefore, its quantum state can be represented as a wave of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a wave function. The position and momentum of the particle are observables. The Uncertainty Principle states that both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be measured with complete precision simultaneously. However, one can measure the position (alone) of a moving free particle, creating an eigenstate of position with a wavefunction that is very large (a Dirac delta) at a particular position x, and zero everywhere else. If one performs a position measurement on such a wavefunction, the resultant x will be obtained with 100% probability (i.e., with full certainty, or complete precision). This is called an eigenstate of position - or, stated in mathematical terms, a generalized position eigenstate (eigendistribution). If the particle is in an eigenstate of position, then its momentum is completely unknown. On the other hand, if the particle is in an eigenstate of momentum, then its position is completely unknown.[46] In an eigenstate of momentum having a plane wave form, it can be shown that the wavelength is equal to h/p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the eigenstate.[47]\n3D confined electron wave functions for each eigenstate in a Quantum Dot. Here, rectangular and triangular-shaped quantum dots are shown. Energy states in rectangular dots are more \u2018s-type\u2019 and \u2018p-type\u2019. However, in a triangular dot, the wave functions are mixed due to confinement symmetry.\nStep potential\nMain article: Solution of Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a step potential\nScattering at a finite potential step of height V 0, shown in green. The amplitudes and direction of left- and right-moving waves are indicated. Yellow is the incident wave, blue are reflected and transmitted waves, red does not occur.

In contrast to classical mechanics, incident particles with energies higher than the size of the potential step are still partially reflected.\nRectangular potential barrier\nMain article: Rectangular potential barrier\nThis is a model for the quantum tunneling effect, which has important applications to modern devices such as flash memory and the scanning tunneling microscope.\nParticle in a box\n1-dimensional potential energy box (or infinite potential well)\nMain article: Particle in a box\nThe particle in a one-dimensional potential energy box is the most simple example where restraints lead to the quantization of energy levels. The box is defined as having zero potential energy everywhere inside a certain region, and infinite potential energy everywhere outside' that region. For the one-dimensional case in the\ndirection, the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written as:[48]\nWriting the differential operator\nthe previous equation can be seen to be evocative of the classic kinetic energy analogue\nwith\nas the energy for the state\n, whioch in this case coincides with the kinetic energy of the particle.\nThe general solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the particle in a box are:\nor, from Euler's formula,\nThe presence of the walls of the box determines the values of C, D, and k. At each wall (x = 0 and x = L), \u03c8 = 0. Thus when x = 0,\nand so D = 0. When x = L,\nC cannot be zero, since this would conflict with the Born interpretation. Therefore, sin kL = 0, and so it must be that kL is an integer multiple of \u03c0. And additionally,\nThe quantization of energy levels follows from this constraint on k, since\nFinite potential well\nMain article: Finite potential well\nThis is generalization of the infinite potential well problem to potential wells of finite depth.\nHarmonic oscillator\nMain article: Quantum harmonic oscillator\nSome trajectories of a harmonic oscillator (i.e. a ball attached to a spring) in classical mechanics (A-B) and quantum mechanics (C-H). In quantum mechanics, the position of the ball is represented by a wave (called the wavefunction), with the real part shown in blue and the imaginary part shown in red. Some of the trajectories (such as C,D,E,and F) are standing waves (or \"stationary states\"). Each standing-wave frequency is proportional to a possible energy level of the oscillator. This \"energy quantization\" does not occur in classical physics, where the oscillator can have any energy.\nAs in the classical case, the potential for the quantum harmonic oscillator is given by:\nThis problem can be solved either by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation directly, which is not trivial, or by using the more elegant \"ladder method\", first proposed by Paul Dirac. The eigenstates are given by:\nwhere Hn are the Hermite polynomials:\nand the corresponding energy levels are\n.\nThis is another example which illustrates the quantization of energy for bound states.\nNotes\n^ The angular momentum of an unbound electron, in contrast, is not quantized.\n^ J.

(I agree that many worlds isn't considered proven, though it has some strong and interesting advocates, e.g. Sean Carroll.) I think Eliezer has far too much invested in his status as a Rational Man to believe what you say.

Can you then extrapolate to figure out when it will happen? No. The barriers are technological, social, and political, and the effort and resources required are so great that the technological ones may be the least important. Will we ever colonize other planets? I don't know, but I'm sure the responses from the top experts now would be a lot less optimistic now than they were right after the moon landings.\nI think that: so it is with AI. I can imagine, perhaps even expect, a failure state where society changes once again to one where the life of each generation is indistinguishable from the previous. I also imagine that the technological barriers are much greater than AI proponents believe. (For example, perhaps we find that a single neuron is itself so complex that it can't be reliably simulated by a supercomputer, and that those details themselves are crucial to intelligence.)\nAnyway, regardless of what happens, to say that it is \"obvious\" it will happen in the not-so-distant future is simply arrogant.\nthemightypuck wrote on 08/16/2009 \u00a0at\u00a0 01:39 PM\nRe: Percontations: Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Mechanics\nAgree completely.\nOtto Kerner wrote on 08/16/2009 \u00a0at\u00a0 02:07 PM\nMany Worlds?\nCan someone explain this \"many worlds\" thing to me? What does it explain? What do we do with it? An explanation, as I see it, is an analogy which relates a posited underlying reality to my observerd experiences. In other words, it relates noumenon to phenomenon. My experience is completely unanimous and unambiguous that I exist in one world at a time. Eliezer argues for an underlying reality in which I exist in many worlds simultaneously. Where is the analogy which relates the one to the other?\nI noticed that, although he may have one, Eliezer does not provide a refutation for Aaronson's argument that what \"many worlds\" loses is science itself. Eliezer instead counters that the Copenhagen interpretation loses naturalism, and more specifically the idea that everything is made out of atoms and other such physical building blocks. The idea that a scientific observation produces one result seems to me much more fundamental than the idea of naturalism, so, forced to choose between then, I would much rather lose naturalism.\nAnd I don't understand Eliezer's argument that \"whatever the right theory is, it has to be a many-worlds theory.\" Per Aaronson, we don't have a halfway decent theory.

He comes across as arrogant, self-righteous and dismissive of dissenting opinion. He would be a nightmare as a teacher or colleague, which probably explains why he works alone on his computer, is an auto-didact and has apparently never had a job in an ordinary work environment (i.e., with f2f interaction with other human beings).\nA lot of really bright people are like that.\nBut most aren't.\nbjkeefe wrote on 08/16/2009 \u00a0at\u00a0 03:34 PM\nRe: Percontations: Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Mechanics\nQuoting themightypuck: Agree completely.\nI see it like you and Jeff, too -- I don't mind Eliezer's affect at all.

In any case, all the science junkies are most likely grateful for the unexpected topic today.\nAlthough I appreciate Eliezer's intelligence, knowledge and enthusiasm, I still find his rigidity exasperating. Scott kept reiterating his overall agreement with the manyworlds idea as the best current interpretation for some of the quantum physics implications while keeping a margin of uncertainty for a view of reality which is very counterintuitive and poses other conceptual problems.

I understand that one needs to hold certain principles (or theories, or hypothesis) as true, at least temporarily, in order to study or develop ways of testing them or expanding them. But, at the same time, one has to be able to step back and have a critical, skeptical view in order to avoid dogmatism. Eliezer doesn't seem to be able to do that.

I don't know whether there is any other agenda behind Scott's expressed ideas during this diavlog. I took what he said at face value. From that perspective, I tend to agree more with his way of maintaining a critical, skeptical view and not take theory for granted. But, what is most important is to understand which position is more likely to advance science. Perhaps the right answer is that a little bit of both is needed: enough certainty to build a theory, and enough uncertainty to keep searching.\nI also would like to see Eliezer discuss other topics to see if there is a difference. However, he has quite consistently shown the same kind of attitude in other diavlogs. I think it is his personality, maturity and cognitive style. Some of that may change over time.

Eliezer instead counters that the Copenhagen interpretation loses naturalism, and more specifically the idea that everything is made out of atoms and other such physical building blocks. The idea that a scientific observation produces one result seems to me much more fundamental than the idea of naturalism, so, forced to choose between then, I would much rather lose naturalism.\nPhilosophy is driving this.

However, the Bohm picture is equally insane. I think it has not been developed as far as the others.\nActually I believe the MWI and the Bohm Interpretation are the only two interpretations put forward so far that offer a realist picture (i.e. assume an objective reality). Hence I think its a 50-50 toss-up between these two, and I'm actually starting to lean Bohm's way.\nThe 'pilot wave' idea was initally put foward by Schrodinger, and then developed futher by Bohm. My take on it is that reality is stratified into three levels, each ontologically real. The top-level has the wave function, a real field, which never collapses - all possible states 'exist', but only in an abstract mathematical sense. The next level has something called the 'qauntum potential', analogous to momentum in classical physics. And the bottom level has the concrete objects we know and love (the particles). The top-levels are 'pliot waves' guiding the particles on the bottom level.\nThis an ontologically very clean picture, as well as being satisfyingly simple. But it seems it would require us to give up reductionism, since both the particle and wave levels are regarded by Bohm as being 'equally real', and\nMikeDrew wrote on 08/18/2009 \u00a0at\u00a0 06:07 AM\nRe: Percontations: Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Mechanics\nQuoting Freddie: I think Eliezer is a really bright guy who sometimes has trouble expressing himself in a way that is respectful to contrary opinion.

Structures on Hilbert Space\nI remarked above that in the same way that all the information we have about the relations between locations in a city is embodied in the spatial relations between the points on a map which represent them, all of the information that we have about the internal relations among (and between) states and quantities in quantum mechanics is embodied in the mathematical relations among the vectors and operators which represent them.[ 10 ] From a mathematical point of view, what really distinguishes quantum mechanics from its classical predecessors is that states and quantities have a richer structure; they form families with a more interesting network of relations among their members.\nAll of the physically consequential features of the behaviors of quantum mechanical systems are consequences of mathematical properties of those relations, and the most important of them are easily summarized:\n(P1) Any way of adding vectors in a Hilbert space or multiplying them by scalars will yield a vector that is also in the space. In the case that the vector is normalized, it will, from (3.1), represent a possible state of the system, and in the event that it is the sum of a pair of eigenvectors of an observable B with distinct eigenvalues, it will not itself be an eigenvector of B, but will be associated, from (3.4b), with a set of probabilities for showing one or another result in B-measurements.\n(P2) For any Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space, there are others, on the same space, with which it doesn't share a full set of eigenvectors; indeed, it is easy to show that there are other such operators with which it has no eigenvectors in common.\nIf we make a couple of additional interpretive assumptions, we can say more. Assume, for instance, that\n(4.1) Every Hermitian operator on the Hilbert space associated with a system represents a distinct observable, and (hence) every normalized vector, a distinct state, and\n(4.2) A system has a value for observable A if, and only if, the vector representing its state is an eigenstate of the A-operator. The value it has, in such a case, is just the eigenvalue associated with that eigenstate.[ 11 ]\nIt follows from (P2), by (3.1), that no quantum mechanical state is an eigenstate of all observables (and indeed that there are observables which have no eigenstates in common), and so, by (3.2), that no quantum mechanical system ever has simultaneous values for all of the quantities pertaining to it (and indeed that there are pairs of quantities to which no state assigns simultaneous values).\nThere are Hermitian operators on the tensor product H1\u2297H2 of a pair of Hilbert spaces H1 and H2 ... In the event that H1 and H2 are the state spaces of systems S1 and S2, H1\u2297H2 is the state-space of the complex system (S1+S2). It follows from this by (4.1) that there are observables pertaining to (S1+S2) whose values are not determined by the values of observables pertaining to the two individually.\nThese are all straightforward consequences of taking vectors and operators in Hilbert space to represent, respectively, states and observables, and applying Born's Rule (and later (4.1) and (4.2)), to give empirical meaning to state assignments. That much is perfectly well understood; the real difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics lies in coming to grips with their implications \u2014 physical, metaphysical, and epistemological.\nThere is one remaining fact about the mathematical structure of the theory that anyone trying to come to an understanding about what it says about the world has to grapple with. It is not a property of Hilbert spaces, this time, but of the dynamics, the rules that describe the trajectories that systems follow through the space. From a physical point of view, it is far more worrisome than anything that has preceded. For, it does much more than present difficulties to someone trying to provide an interpretation of the theory, it seems to point either to a logical inconsistency in the theory's foundations.\nSuppose that we have a system S and a device S* which measures an observable A on S with values {a1, a2, a3...}. Then there is some state of S* (the \u2018ground state\u2019), and some observable B with values {b1, b2, b3...} pertaining to S* (its \u2018pointer observable\u2019, so called because it is whatever plays the role of the pointer on a dial on the front of a schematic measuring instrument in registering the result of the experiment), which are such that, if S* is started in its ground state and interacts in an appropriate way with S, and if the value of A immediately before the interaction is a1, then B's value immediately thereafter is b1. If, however, A's value immediately before the interaction is a2, then B's value afterwards is b2; if the value of A immediately before the interaction is a3, then B's value immediately after is b3, and so on. That is just what it means to say that S* measures A. So, if we represent the joint, partial state of S and S* (just the part of it which specifies the value of [A on S & B on S*], the observable whose values correspond to joint assignments of values to the measured observable on S and the pointer observable on S*) by the vector |A=ai>s|B=b i>s*, and let \"\u2192\" stand in for the dynamical description of the interaction between the two, to say that S* is a measuring instrument for A is to say that the dynamical laws entail that,\n|A= a 1> s|B=ground state> s* \u2192 |A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s*\n|A=a2>s|B=ground state>s* \u2192 |A=a2>s|B=b2> s*\n|A=a3>s|B=ground state>s* \u2192 |A=a3>s|B=b3> s*\nand so on.[ 12 ]\nIntuitively, S* is a measuring instrument for an observable A just in case there is some observable feature of S* (it doesn't matter what, just something whose values can be ascertained by looking at the device), which is correlated with the A-values of systems fed into it in such a way that we can read those values off of S*'s observable state after the interaction. In philosophical parlance, S* is a measuring instrument for A just in case there is some observable feature of S* which tracks or indicates the A-values of systems with which it interacts in an appropriate way.\nNow, it follows from (3.1), above, that there are states of S (too many to count) which are not eigenstates of A, and if we consider what Schr\u00f6dinger's equation tells us about the joint evolution of S and S* when S is started out in one of these, we find that the state of the pair after interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of [A on S & B on S*]. It doesn't matter what observable on S is being measured, and it doesn't matter what particular superposition S starts out in; when it is fed into a measuring instrument for that observable, if the interaction is correctly described by Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, it follows just from the linearity of the U in that equation, the operator that effects the transformation from the earlier to the later state of the pair, that the joint state of S and the apparatus after the interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of this observable on the joint system.\nSuppose, for example, that we start S* in its ground state, and S in the state\n1/\u221a2|A= a 1> s| + 1/\u221a2|A= a 2> s\nIt is a consequence of the rules for obtaining the state-space of the composite system that the combined state of the pair is\n1/\u221a2|A=a1>s|B=ground state>s* + 1/\u221a2|A=a2>s|B=ground state>s*\nand it follows from the fact that S* is a measuring instrument for A, and the linearity of U that their combined state after interaction, is\n1/\u221a2|A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s* + 1/\u221a2|A= a 2> s|B= b 2> s*\nThis, however, is inconsistent with the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2, for the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2 (and if there are any such contexts, this is one) entails that the state of the pair after interaction is either\n|A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s*\nor\n|A=a2>s|B=b2> s*\nIndeed, it entails that there is a precise probability of 1/2 that it will end up in the former, and a probability of 1/2 that it will end up in the latter.\nWe can try to restore logical consistency by giving up the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2 (or, what amounts to the same thing, by denying that there are any such contexts), but then we have the problem of consistency with experience. For it was no mere blunder that that rule was included in the theory; we know what a system looks like when it is in an eigenstate of a given observable, and we know from looking that the measuring apparatus after measurement is in an eigenstate of the pointer observable. And so we know from the outset that if a theory tells us something else about the post-measurement states of measuring apparatuses, whatever that something else is, it is wrong.\nThat, in a nutshell, is the Measurement Problem in quantum mechanics; any interpretation of the theory, any detailed story about what the world is like according to quantum mechanics, and in particular those bits of the world in which measurements are going on, has to grapple with it.\nLoose Ends\nMixed states are weighted sums of pure states, and they can be used to represent the states of ensembles whose components are in different pure states, or states of individual systems about which we have only partial knowledge. In the first case, the weight attached to a given pure state reflects the size of the component of the ensemble which is in that state (and hence the objective probability that an arbitrary member of the ensemble is); in the second case, they reflect the epistemic probability that the system in question to which the state is assigned is in that state.\nIf we don't want to lose the distinction between pure and mixed states, we need a way of representing the weighted sum of a set of pure states (equivalently, of the probability functions associated with them) that is different from adding the (suitably weighted) vectors that represent them, and that means that we need either an alternative way of representing mixed states, or a uniform way of representing both pure and mixed states that preserves the distinction between them. There is a kind of operator in Hilbert spaces, called a density operator, that serves well in the latter capacity, and it turns out not to be hard to restate everything that has been said about state vectors in terms of density operators. So, even though it is common to speak as though pure states are represented by vectors, the official rule is that states \u2013 pure and mixed, alike - are represented in quantum mechanics by density operators.\nAlthough mixed states can, as I said, be used to represent our ignorance of the states of systems that are actually in one or another pure state, and although this has seemed to many to be an adequate way of interpreting mixtures in classical contexts, there are serious obstacles to applying it generally to quantum mechanical mixtures. These are left for detailed discussion in the other entries on quantum mechanics in the Encyclopedia.\nEverything that has been said about observables, strictly speaking, applies only to the case in which the values of the observable form a discrete set; the mathematical niceties that are needed to generalize it to the case of continuous observables are complicated, and raise problems of a more technical nature. These, too, are best left for detailed discussion.\nThis should be all the initial preparation one needs to approach the philosophical discussion of quantum mechanics, but it is only a first step. The more one learns about the relationships among and between vectors and operators in Hilbert space, about how the spaces of simple systems relate to those of complex ones, and about the equation which describes how state-vectors move through the space, the better will be one's appreciation of both the nature and the difficulty of the problems associated with the theory. The funny backwards thing about quantum mechanics, the thing that makes it endlessly absorbing to a philosopher, is that the more one learns, the harder the problems get.\nBibliography\nQuantum Mechanics Textbooks\nThere are a great many textbooks available for studying quantum mechanics. Here are a few especially important ones with some notes to guide choices among them. It is good to work with two or three texts when learning QM. No text is perfect and differences in approach can illuminate the subject from different angles.\nBallentine, L., 1998, Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Approach, Singapore: World Scientific Publishing Company.\nThis book is not recommended for beginners, and not recommended as a textbook. It is recommended once one has some technical background to deepen understanding of the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics.\nBasdevant, J.L., and J. Dalibard, 2005, Quantum Mechanics, Berlin: Springer.\nThis is a brief, but elegant introduction. There aren't a great many problems, but detailed solutions are provided for those that are included. The book comes with a CD-ROM that is very helpful for visualization.\nCohen-Tannoudji, C., 2006, Quantum Mechanics, New York: Wiley-Interscience.\nThis is a comprehensive, encyclopedic text. It's not the best to learn from, but is a good reference book.\nGasiorowicz, S., 1995, Quantum Physics (3rd edition), New York: Wiley.\nThis is a decent text, relatively well-written.\nGriffiths, D., 1995, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (2nd edition), Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.\nThis is a standard undergraduate text for a first course in QM, and I would recommend it as a starting point for beginners. It is concise and very easy to read. There is an emphasis on conceptual development. Unfortunately, there are no worked examples in the book, and the answers to the problems are available only to instructors. It is easy to find and has recently been updated.\nLiboff, R., 1998, Introductory Quantum Mechanics (4th edition), San Francisco: Addison-Wesley.\nThis is a nicely designed book, relatively well-written. It is a good starting point for beginners, but not at comprehensive as Shankar.\nMerzbacher, E., 1997, Quantum Mechanics (3rd edition), New York: Wiley.\nThis is a standard graduate text in the US, not recommended for beginners, but quite good at an advanced level.\nSakurai, J.J., 1993, Modern Quantum Mechanics (revised edition), Reading, MA: Addison Wesley.\nThis is generally used as a graduate text. It is well-written and there is emphasis on experimental phenomena and important questions like Bell's Inequality. The material is introduced at a higher level than Griffiths and Shankar, with lots of mathematics. There is a wealth of problems, but unfortunately few solutions are provided, making it most useful in a classroom setting or in conjunction with a book that contains worked examples and derivations.\nSchwinger, J., 2003, Quantum Mechanics (corrected edition), Berlin: Springer.\nThis book is extremely mathematical in emphasis. There is less emphasis on conceptual development, and it is best used after one has acquired a conceptual understanding of QM and wants to see the mathematical development. The approach is very revealing. It is a difficult text, in part because some of the formalism is abstract and unconventional, but it is well worth the effort to comprehend. The problems throughout are excellent, but again unfortunately, solutions are not included in the text.\nShankar, R., 1994, Principles of Quantum Mechanics (2nd edition), Berlin: Springer.\nThis book is highly recommended as a starting point. It starts from ground zero, developing the mathematical tools needed to understand quantum mechanics. It is well written, and friendlier than Griffiths for students who are learning the subject on their own. QM is not introduced until page 115. \u2028The introductory chapter on linear algebra is very good. At 676 pages, it is comprehensive. It covers Feynman path integrals more thoroughly than other books, and contains solved problems. If you buy one book on QM, this is a good choice.\nZettili, N., 2009, Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications, Chichester: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nThis is a very good book as well. It covers theory and problem solving in an integrated way. It is easy to follow and full of problems and solutions that are related to the experimental basis of the theory.\nUseful General Texts in Mathematics and Physics\nWhether studying quantum mechanics on one\u2019s own, or in a classroom setting, it is useful to have these books on hand as accompaniments. Even a seasoned teacher will find himself from time to time reaching for them:\nBenenson, W., J. Harris, H. Stoecker, , and H. Lutz, 2006, Handbook of Physics (2nd edition), Berlin: Springer.\nBronshtein, I.N., and K.A. Semendyayev, 2007, Handbook of Mathematics (5th edition), Berlin: Springer.\nHalliday, D., R. Resnick, and J. Walker, 2008, Fundamentals of Physics (8th edition), Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.\nHalmos, P., 1957, Introduction to Hilbert Space (2nd edition), Providence: AMS Chelsea Publishing.\nBooks on Philosophy of QM\nHere are some general texts to introduce you to the philosophy of QM.

It doesn't matter what observable on S is being measured, and it doesn't matter what particular superposition S starts out in; when it is fed into a measuring instrument for that observable, if the interaction is correctly described by Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, it follows just from the linearity of the U in that equation, the operator that effects the transformation from the earlier to the later state of the pair, that the joint state of S and the apparatus after the interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of this observable on the joint system.\nSuppose, for example, that we start S* in its ground state, and S in the state\n1/\u221a2|A= a 1> s| + 1/\u221a2|A= a 2> s\nIt is a consequence of the rules for obtaining the state-space of the composite system that the combined state of the pair is\n1/\u221a2|A=a1>s|B=ground state>s* + 1/\u221a2|A=a2>s|B=ground state>s*\nand it follows from the fact that S* is a measuring instrument for A, and the linearity of U that their combined state after interaction, is\n1/\u221a2|A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s* + 1/\u221a2|A= a 2> s|B= b 2> s*\nThis, however, is inconsistent with the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2, for the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2 (and if there are any such contexts, this is one) entails that the state of the pair after interaction is either\n|A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s*\nor\n|A=a2>s|B=b2> s*\nIndeed, it entails that there is a precise probability of 1/2 that it will end up in the former, and a probability of 1/2 that it will end up in the latter.\nWe can try to restore logical consistency by giving up the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2 (or, what amounts to the same thing, by denying that there are any such contexts), but then we have the problem of consistency with experience. For it was no mere blunder that that rule was included in the theory; we know what a system looks like when it is in an eigenstate of a given observable, and we know from looking that the measuring apparatus after measurement is in an eigenstate of the pointer observable. And so we know from the outset that if a theory tells us something else about the post-measurement states of measuring apparatuses, whatever that something else is, it is wrong.\nThat, in a nutshell, is the Measurement Problem in quantum mechanics; any interpretation of the theory, any detailed story about what the world is like according to quantum mechanics, and in particular those bits of the world in which measurements are going on, has to grapple with it.\nLoose Ends\nMixed states are weighted sums of pure states, and they can be used to represent the states of ensembles whose components are in different pure states, or states of individual systems about which we have only partial knowledge. In the first case, the weight attached to a given pure state reflects the size of the component of the ensemble which is in that state (and hence the objective probability that an arbitrary member of the ensemble is); in the second case, they reflect the epistemic probability that the system in question to which the state is assigned is in that state.\nIf we don't want to lose the distinction between pure and mixed states, we need a way of representing the weighted sum of a set of pure states (equivalently, of the probability functions associated with them) that is different from adding the (suitably weighted) vectors that represent them, and that means that we need either an alternative way of representing mixed states, or a uniform way of representing both pure and mixed states that preserves the distinction between them. There is a kind of operator in Hilbert spaces, called a density operator, that serves well in the latter capacity, and it turns out not to be hard to restate everything that has been said about state vectors in terms of density operators. So, even though it is common to speak as though pure states are represented by vectors, the official rule is that states \u2013 pure and mixed, alike - are represented in quantum mechanics by density operators.\nAlthough mixed states can, as I said, be used to represent our ignorance of the states of systems that are actually in one or another pure state, and although this has seemed to many to be an adequate way of interpreting mixtures in classical contexts, there are serious obstacles to applying it generally to quantum mechanical mixtures. These are left for detailed discussion in the other entries on quantum mechanics in the Encyclopedia.\nEverything that has been said about observables, strictly speaking, applies only to the case in which the values of the observable form a discrete set; the mathematical niceties that are needed to generalize it to the case of continuous observables are complicated, and raise problems of a more technical nature. These, too, are best left for detailed discussion.\nThis should be all the initial preparation one needs to approach the philosophical discussion of quantum mechanics, but it is only a first step. The more one learns about the relationships among and between vectors and operators in Hilbert space, about how the spaces of simple systems relate to those of complex ones, and about the equation which describes how state-vectors move through the space, the better will be one's appreciation of both the nature and the difficulty of the problems associated with the theory. The funny backwards thing about quantum mechanics, the thing that makes it endlessly absorbing to a philosopher, is that the more one learns, the harder the problems get.\nBibliography\nQuantum Mechanics Textbooks\nThere are a great many textbooks available for studying quantum mechanics. Here are a few especially important ones with some notes to guide choices among them. It is good to work with two or three texts when learning QM. No text is perfect and differences in approach can illuminate the subject from different angles.\nBallentine, L., 1998, Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Approach, Singapore: World Scientific Publishing Company.\nThis book is not recommended for beginners, and not recommended as a textbook. It is recommended once one has some technical background to deepen understanding of the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics.\nBasdevant, J.L., and J. Dalibard, 2005, Quantum Mechanics, Berlin: Springer.\nThis is a brief, but elegant introduction. There aren't a great many problems, but detailed solutions are provided for those that are included. The book comes with a CD-ROM that is very helpful for visualization.\nCohen-Tannoudji, C., 2006, Quantum Mechanics, New York: Wiley-Interscience.\nThis is a comprehensive, encyclopedic text. It's not the best to learn from, but is a good reference book.\nGasiorowicz, S., 1995, Quantum Physics (3rd edition), New York: Wiley.\nThis is a decent text, relatively well-written.\nGriffiths, D., 1995, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (2nd edition), Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.\nThis is a standard undergraduate text for a first course in QM, and I would recommend it as a starting point for beginners. It is concise and very easy to read. There is an emphasis on conceptual development. Unfortunately, there are no worked examples in the book, and the answers to the problems are available only to instructors. It is easy to find and has recently been updated.\nLiboff, R., 1998, Introductory Quantum Mechanics (4th edition), San Francisco: Addison-Wesley.\nThis is a nicely designed book, relatively well-written. It is a good starting point for beginners, but not at comprehensive as Shankar.\nMerzbacher, E., 1997, Quantum Mechanics (3rd edition), New York: Wiley.\nThis is a standard graduate text in the US, not recommended for beginners, but quite good at an advanced level.\nSakurai, J.J., 1993, Modern Quantum Mechanics (revised edition), Reading, MA: Addison Wesley.\nThis is generally used as a graduate text. It is well-written and there is emphasis on experimental phenomena and important questions like Bell's Inequality. The material is introduced at a higher level than Griffiths and Shankar, with lots of mathematics. There is a wealth of problems, but unfortunately few solutions are provided, making it most useful in a classroom setting or in conjunction with a book that contains worked examples and derivations.\nSchwinger, J., 2003, Quantum Mechanics (corrected edition), Berlin: Springer.\nThis book is extremely mathematical in emphasis. There is less emphasis on conceptual development, and it is best used after one has acquired a conceptual understanding of QM and wants to see the mathematical development. The approach is very revealing. It is a difficult text, in part because some of the formalism is abstract and unconventional, but it is well worth the effort to comprehend. The problems throughout are excellent, but again unfortunately, solutions are not included in the text.\nShankar, R., 1994, Principles of Quantum Mechanics (2nd edition), Berlin: Springer.\nThis book is highly recommended as a starting point. It starts from ground zero, developing the mathematical tools needed to understand quantum mechanics. It is well written, and friendlier than Griffiths for students who are learning the subject on their own. QM is not introduced until page 115. \u2028The introductory chapter on linear algebra is very good. At 676 pages, it is comprehensive. It covers Feynman path integrals more thoroughly than other books, and contains solved problems. If you buy one book on QM, this is a good choice.\nZettili, N., 2009, Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications, Chichester: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nThis is a very good book as well. It covers theory and problem solving in an integrated way. It is easy to follow and full of problems and solutions that are related to the experimental basis of the theory.\nUseful General Texts in Mathematics and Physics\nWhether studying quantum mechanics on one\u2019s own, or in a classroom setting, it is useful to have these books on hand as accompaniments.

This is known as the Collapse Postulate. Which particular B-eigenstate it collapses into is a matter of probability, and the probabilities are given by a rule known as Born's Rule:\nprob( b i) = |<A|B=b i>| 2.\nThere are two important points to note about these two kinds of contexts:\nThe distinction between contexts of type 1 and 2 remains to be made out in quantum mechanical terms; nobody has managed to say in a completely satisfactory way, in the terms provided by the theory, which contexts are measurement contexts, and\nEven if the distinction is made out, it is an open interpretive question whether there are contexts of type 2; i.e., it is an open interpretive question whether there are any contexts in which systems are governed by a dynamical rule other than Schr\u00f6dinger's equation.\n4. Structures on Hilbert Space\nI remarked above that in the same way that all the information we have about the relations between locations in a city is embodied in the spatial relations between the points on a map which represent them, all of the information that we have about the internal relations among (and between) states and quantities in quantum mechanics is embodied in the mathematical relations among the vectors and operators which represent them.[ 10 ] From a mathematical point of view, what really distinguishes quantum mechanics from its classical predecessors is that states and quantities have a richer structure; they form families with a more interesting network of relations among their members.\nAll of the physically consequential features of the behaviors of quantum mechanical systems are consequences of mathematical properties of those relations, and the most important of them are easily summarized:\n(P1) Any way of adding vectors in a Hilbert space or multiplying them by scalars will yield a vector that is also in the space. In the case that the vector is normalized, it will, from (3.1), represent a possible state of the system, and in the event that it is the sum of a pair of eigenvectors of an observable B with distinct eigenvalues, it will not itself be an eigenvector of B, but will be associated, from (3.4b), with a set of probabilities for showing one or another result in B-measurements.\n(P2) For any Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space, there are others, on the same space, with which it doesn't share a full set of eigenvectors; indeed, it is easy to show that there are other such operators with which it has no eigenvectors in common.\nIf we make a couple of additional interpretive assumptions, we can say more. Assume, for instance, that\n(4.1) Every Hermitian operator on the Hilbert space associated with a system represents a distinct observable, and (hence) every normalized vector, a distinct state, and\n(4.2) A system has a value for observable A if, and only if, the vector representing its state is an eigenstate of the A-operator. The value it has, in such a case, is just the eigenvalue associated with that eigenstate.[ 11 ]\nIt follows from (P2), by (3.1), that no quantum mechanical state is an eigenstate of all observables (and indeed that there are observables which have no eigenstates in common), and so, by (3.2), that no quantum mechanical system ever has simultaneous values for all of the quantities pertaining to it (and indeed that there are pairs of quantities to which no state assigns simultaneous values).\nThere are Hermitian operators on the tensor product H1\u2297H2 of a pair of Hilbert spaces H1 and H2 ... In the event that H1 and H2 are the state spaces of systems S1 and S2, H1\u2297H2 is the state-space of the complex system (S1+S2). It follows from this by (4.1) that there are observables pertaining to (S1+S2) whose values are not determined by the values of observables pertaining to the two individually.\nThese are all straightforward consequences of taking vectors and operators in Hilbert space to represent, respectively, states and observables, and applying Born's Rule (and later (4.1) and (4.2)), to give empirical meaning to state assignments. That much is perfectly well understood; the real difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics lies in coming to grips with their implications \u2014 physical, metaphysical, and epistemological.\nThere is one remaining fact about the mathematical structure of the theory that anyone trying to come to an understanding about what it says about the world has to grapple with. It is not a property of Hilbert spaces, this time, but of the dynamics, the rules that describe the trajectories that systems follow through the space. From a physical point of view, it is far more worrisome than anything that has preceded. For, it does much more than present difficulties to someone trying to provide an interpretation of the theory, it seems to point either to a logical inconsistency in the theory's foundations.\nSuppose that we have a system S and a device S* which measures an observable A on S with values {a1, a2, a3...}. Then there is some state of S* (the \u2018ground state\u2019), and some observable B with values {b1, b2, b3...} pertaining to S* (its \u2018pointer observable\u2019, so called because it is whatever plays the role of the pointer on a dial on the front of a schematic measuring instrument in registering the result of the experiment), which are such that, if S* is started in its ground state and interacts in an appropriate way with S, and if the value of A immediately before the interaction is a1, then B's value immediately thereafter is b1. If, however, A's value immediately before the interaction is a2, then B's value afterwards is b2; if the value of A immediately before the interaction is a3, then B's value immediately after is b3, and so on. That is just what it means to say that S* measures A. So, if we represent the joint, partial state of S and S* (just the part of it which specifies the value of [A on S & B on S*], the observable whose values correspond to joint assignments of values to the measured observable on S and the pointer observable on S*) by the vector |A=ai>s|B=b i>s*, and let \"\u2192\" stand in for the dynamical description of the interaction between the two, to say that S* is a measuring instrument for A is to say that the dynamical laws entail that,\n|A= a 1> s|B=ground state> s* \u2192 |A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s*\n|A=a2>s|B=ground state>s* \u2192 |A=a2>s|B=b2> s*\n|A=a3>s|B=ground state>s* \u2192 |A=a3>s|B=b3> s*\nand so on.[ 12 ]\nIntuitively, S* is a measuring instrument for an observable A just in case there is some observable feature of S* (it doesn't matter what, just something whose values can be ascertained by looking at the device), which is correlated with the A-values of systems fed into it in such a way that we can read those values off of S*'s observable state after the interaction. In philosophical parlance, S* is a measuring instrument for A just in case there is some observable feature of S* which tracks or indicates the A-values of systems with which it interacts in an appropriate way.\nNow, it follows from (3.1), above, that there are states of S (too many to count) which are not eigenstates of A, and if we consider what Schr\u00f6dinger's equation tells us about the joint evolution of S and S* when S is started out in one of these, we find that the state of the pair after interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of [A on S & B on S*].

This is known as the Collapse Postulate. Which particular B-eigenstate it collapses into is a matter of probability, and the probabilities are given by a rule known as Born's Rule:\nprob( b i) = |<A|B=b i>| 2.\nThere are two important points to note about these two kinds of contexts:\nThe distinction between contexts of type 1 and 2 remains to be made out in quantum mechanical terms; nobody has managed to say in a completely satisfactory way, in the terms provided by the theory, which contexts are measurement contexts, and\nEven if the distinction is made out, it is an open interpretive question whether there are contexts of type 2; i.e., it is an open interpretive question whether there are any contexts in which systems are governed by a dynamical rule other than Schr\u00f6dinger's equation.\n4. Structures on Hilbert Space\nI remarked above that in the same way that all the information we have about the relations between locations in a city is embodied in the spatial relations between the points on a map which represent them, all of the information that we have about the internal relations among (and between) states and quantities in quantum mechanics is embodied in the mathematical relations among the vectors and operators which represent them.[ 10 ] From a mathematical point of view, what really distinguishes quantum mechanics from its classical predecessors is that states and quantities have a richer structure; they form families with a more interesting network of relations among their members.\nAll of the physically consequential features of the behaviors of quantum mechanical systems are consequences of mathematical properties of those relations, and the most important of them are easily summarized:\n(P1) Any way of adding vectors in a Hilbert space or multiplying them by scalars will yield a vector that is also in the space. In the case that the vector is normalized, it will, from (3.1), represent a possible state of the system, and in the event that it is the sum of a pair of eigenvectors of an observable B with distinct eigenvalues, it will not itself be an eigenvector of B, but will be associated, from (3.4b), with a set of probabilities for showing one or another result in B-measurements.\n(P2) For any Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space, there are others, on the same space, with which it doesn't share a full set of eigenvectors; indeed, it is easy to show that there are other such operators with which it has no eigenvectors in common.\nIf we make a couple of additional interpretive assumptions, we can say more. Assume, for instance, that\n(4.1) Every Hermitian operator on the Hilbert space associated with a system represents a distinct observable, and (hence) every normalized vector, a distinct state, and\n(4.2) A system has a value for observable A if, and only if, the vector representing its state is an eigenstate of the A-operator. The value it has, in such a case, is just the eigenvalue associated with that eigenstate.[ 11 ]\nIt follows from (P2), by (3.1), that no quantum mechanical state is an eigenstate of all observables (and indeed that there are observables which have no eigenstates in common), and so, by (3.2), that no quantum mechanical system ever has simultaneous values for all of the quantities pertaining to it (and indeed that there are pairs of quantities to which no state assigns simultaneous values).\nThere are Hermitian operators on the tensor product H1\u2297H2 of a pair of Hilbert spaces H1 and H2 ... In the event that H1 and H2 are the state spaces of systems S1 and S2, H1\u2297H2 is the state-space of the complex system (S1+S2). It follows from this by (4.1) that there are observables pertaining to (S1+S2) whose values are not determined by the values of observables pertaining to the two individually.\nThese are all straightforward consequences of taking vectors and operators in Hilbert space to represent, respectively, states and observables, and applying Born's Rule (and later (4.1) and (4.2)), to give empirical meaning to state assignments. That much is perfectly well understood; the real difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics lies in coming to grips with their implications \u2014 physical, metaphysical, and epistemological.\nThere is one remaining fact about the mathematical structure of the theory that anyone trying to come to an understanding about what it says about the world has to grapple with. It is not a property of Hilbert spaces, this time, but of the dynamics, the rules that describe the trajectories that systems follow through the space. From a physical point of view, it is far more worrisome than anything that has preceded. For, it does much more than present difficulties to someone trying to provide an interpretation of the theory, it seems to point either to a logical inconsistency in the theory's foundations.\nSuppose that we have a system S and a device S* which measures an observable A on S with values {a1, a2, a3...}. Then there is some state of S* (the \u2018ground state\u2019), and some observable B with values {b1, b2, b3...} pertaining to S* (its \u2018pointer observable\u2019, so called because it is whatever plays the role of the pointer on a dial on the front of a schematic measuring instrument in registering the result of the experiment), which are such that, if S* is started in its ground state and interacts in an appropriate way with S, and if the value of A immediately before the interaction is a1, then B's value immediately thereafter is b1. If, however, A's value immediately before the interaction is a2, then B's value afterwards is b2; if the value of A immediately before the interaction is a3, then B's value immediately after is b3, and so on. That is just what it means to say that S* measures A. So, if we represent the joint, partial state of S and S* (just the part of it which specifies the value of [A on S & B on S*], the observable whose values correspond to joint assignments of values to the measured observable on S and the pointer observable on S*) by the vector |A=ai>s|B=b i>s*, and let \"\u2192\" stand in for the dynamical description of the interaction between the two, to say that S* is a measuring instrument for A is to say that the dynamical laws entail that,\n|A= a 1> s|B=ground state> s* \u2192 |A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s*\n|A=a2>s|B=ground state>s* \u2192 |A=a2>s|B=b2> s*\n|A=a3>s|B=ground state>s* \u2192 |A=a3>s|B=b3> s*\nand so on.[ 12 ]\nIntuitively, S* is a measuring instrument for an observable A just in case there is some observable feature of S* (it doesn't matter what, just something whose values can be ascertained by looking at the device), which is correlated with the A-values of systems fed into it in such a way that we can read those values off of S*'s observable state after the interaction. In philosophical parlance, S* is a measuring instrument for A just in case there is some observable feature of S* which tracks or indicates the A-values of systems with which it interacts in an appropriate way.\nNow, it follows from (3.1), above, that there are states of S (too many to count) which are not eigenstates of A, and if we consider what Schr\u00f6dinger's equation tells us about the joint evolution of S and S* when S is started out in one of these, we find that the state of the pair after interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of [A on S & B on S*]. It doesn't matter what observable on S is being measured, and it doesn't matter what particular superposition S starts out in; when it is fed into a measuring instrument for that observable, if the interaction is correctly described by Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, it follows just from the linearity of the U in that equation, the operator that effects the transformation from the earlier to the later state of the pair, that the joint state of S and the apparatus after the interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of this observable on the joint system.\nSuppose, for example, that we start S* in its ground state, and S in the state\n1/\u221a2|A= a 1> s| + 1/\u221a2|A= a 2> s\nIt is a consequence of the rules for obtaining the state-space of the composite system that the combined state of the pair is\n1/\u221a2|A=a1>s|B=ground state>s* + 1/\u221a2|A=a2>s|B=ground state>s*\nand it follows from the fact that S* is a measuring instrument for A, and the linearity of U that their combined state after interaction, is\n1/\u221a2|A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s* + 1/\u221a2|A= a 2> s|B= b 2> s*\nThis, however, is inconsistent with the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2, for the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2 (and if there are any such contexts, this is one) entails that the state of the pair after interaction is either\n|A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s*\nor\n|A=a2>s|B=b2> s*\nIndeed, it entails that there is a precise probability of 1/2 that it will end up in the former, and a probability of 1/2 that it will end up in the latter.\nWe can try to restore logical consistency by giving up the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2 (or, what amounts to the same thing, by denying that there are any such contexts), but then we have the problem of consistency with experience. For it was no mere blunder that that rule was included in the theory; we know what a system looks like when it is in an eigenstate of a given observable, and we know from looking that the measuring apparatus after measurement is in an eigenstate of the pointer observable. And so we know from the outset that if a theory tells us something else about the post-measurement states of measuring apparatuses, whatever that something else is, it is wrong.\nThat, in a nutshell, is the Measurement Problem in quantum mechanics; any interpretation of the theory, any detailed story about what the world is like according to quantum mechanics, and in particular those bits of the world in which measurements are going on, has to grapple with it.\nLoose Ends\nMixed states are weighted sums of pure states, and they can be used to represent the states of ensembles whose components are in different pure states, or states of individual systems about which we have only partial knowledge. In the first case, the weight attached to a given pure state reflects the size of the component of the ensemble which is in that state (and hence the objective probability that an arbitrary member of the ensemble is); in the second case, they reflect the epistemic probability that the system in question to which the state is assigned is in that state.\nIf we don't want to lose the distinction between pure and mixed states, we need a way of representing the weighted sum of a set of pure states (equivalently, of the probability functions associated with them) that is different from adding the (suitably weighted) vectors that represent them, and that means that we need either an alternative way of representing mixed states, or a uniform way of representing both pure and mixed states that preserves the distinction between them. There is a kind of operator in Hilbert spaces, called a density operator, that serves well in the latter capacity, and it turns out not to be hard to restate everything that has been said about state vectors in terms of density operators. So, even though it is common to speak as though pure states are represented by vectors, the official rule is that states \u2013 pure and mixed, alike - are represented in quantum mechanics by density operators.\nAlthough mixed states can, as I said, be used to represent our ignorance of the states of systems that are actually in one or another pure state, and although this has seemed to many to be an adequate way of interpreting mixtures in classical contexts, there are serious obstacles to applying it generally to quantum mechanical mixtures. These are left for detailed discussion in the other entries on quantum mechanics in the Encyclopedia.\nEverything that has been said about observables, strictly speaking, applies only to the case in which the values of the observable form a discrete set; the mathematical niceties that are needed to generalize it to the case of continuous observables are complicated, and raise problems of a more technical nature. These, too, are best left for detailed discussion.\nThis should be all the initial preparation one needs to approach the philosophical discussion of quantum mechanics, but it is only a first step. The more one learns about the relationships among and between vectors and operators in Hilbert space, about how the spaces of simple systems relate to those of complex ones, and about the equation which describes how state-vectors move through the space, the better will be one's appreciation of both the nature and the difficulty of the problems associated with the theory. The funny backwards thing about quantum mechanics, the thing that makes it endlessly absorbing to a philosopher, is that the more one learns, the harder the problems get.\nBibliography\nQuantum Mechanics Textbooks\nThere are a great many textbooks available for studying quantum mechanics. Here are a few especially important ones with some notes to guide choices among them. It is good to work with two or three texts when learning QM.

So, if we represent the joint, partial state of S and S* (just the part of it which specifies the value of [A on S & B on S*], the observable whose values correspond to joint assignments of values to the measured observable on S and the pointer observable on S*) by the vector |A=ai>s|B=b i>s*, and let \"\u2192\" stand in for the dynamical description of the interaction between the two, to say that S* is a measuring instrument for A is to say that the dynamical laws entail that,\n|A= a 1> s|B=ground state> s* \u2192 |A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s*\n|A=a2>s|B=ground state>s* \u2192 |A=a2>s|B=b2> s*\n|A=a3>s|B=ground state>s* \u2192 |A=a3>s|B=b3> s*\nand so on.[ 12 ]\nIntuitively, S* is a measuring instrument for an observable A just in case there is some observable feature of S* (it doesn't matter what, just something whose values can be ascertained by looking at the device), which is correlated with the A-values of systems fed into it in such a way that we can read those values off of S*'s observable state after the interaction. In philosophical parlance, S* is a measuring instrument for A just in case there is some observable feature of S* which tracks or indicates the A-values of systems with which it interacts in an appropriate way.\nNow, it follows from (3.1), above, that there are states of S (too many to count) which are not eigenstates of A, and if we consider what Schr\u00f6dinger's equation tells us about the joint evolution of S and S* when S is started out in one of these, we find that the state of the pair after interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of [A on S & B on S*]. It doesn't matter what observable on S is being measured, and it doesn't matter what particular superposition S starts out in; when it is fed into a measuring instrument for that observable, if the interaction is correctly described by Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, it follows just from the linearity of the U in that equation, the operator that effects the transformation from the earlier to the later state of the pair, that the joint state of S and the apparatus after the interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of this observable on the joint system.\nSuppose, for example, that we start S* in its ground state, and S in the state\n1/\u221a2|A= a 1> s| + 1/\u221a2|A= a 2> s\nIt is a consequence of the rules for obtaining the state-space of the composite system that the combined state of the pair is\n1/\u221a2|A=a1>s|B=ground state>s* + 1/\u221a2|A=a2>s|B=ground state>s*\nand it follows from the fact that S* is a measuring instrument for A, and the linearity of U that their combined state after interaction, is\n1/\u221a2|A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s* + 1/\u221a2|A= a 2> s|B= b 2> s*\nThis, however, is inconsistent with the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2, for the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2 (and if there are any such contexts, this is one) entails that the state of the pair after interaction is either\n|A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s*\nor\n|A=a2>s|B=b2> s*\nIndeed, it entails that there is a precise probability of 1/2 that it will end up in the former, and a probability of 1/2 that it will end up in the latter.\nWe can try to restore logical consistency by giving up the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2 (or, what amounts to the same thing, by denying that there are any such contexts), but then we have the problem of consistency with experience. For it was no mere blunder that that rule was included in the theory; we know what a system looks like when it is in an eigenstate of a given observable, and we know from looking that the measuring apparatus after measurement is in an eigenstate of the pointer observable. And so we know from the outset that if a theory tells us something else about the post-measurement states of measuring apparatuses, whatever that something else is, it is wrong.\nThat, in a nutshell, is the Measurement Problem in quantum mechanics; any interpretation of the theory, any detailed story about what the world is like according to quantum mechanics, and in particular those bits of the world in which measurements are going on, has to grapple with it.\nLoose Ends\nMixed states are weighted sums of pure states, and they can be used to represent the states of ensembles whose components are in different pure states, or states of individual systems about which we have only partial knowledge. In the first case, the weight attached to a given pure state reflects the size of the component of the ensemble which is in that state (and hence the objective probability that an arbitrary member of the ensemble is); in the second case, they reflect the epistemic probability that the system in question to which the state is assigned is in that state.\nIf we don't want to lose the distinction between pure and mixed states, we need a way of representing the weighted sum of a set of pure states (equivalently, of the probability functions associated with them) that is different from adding the (suitably weighted) vectors that represent them, and that means that we need either an alternative way of representing mixed states, or a uniform way of representing both pure and mixed states that preserves the distinction between them. There is a kind of operator in Hilbert spaces, called a density operator, that serves well in the latter capacity, and it turns out not to be hard to restate everything that has been said about state vectors in terms of density operators. So, even though it is common to speak as though pure states are represented by vectors, the official rule is that states \u2013 pure and mixed, alike - are represented in quantum mechanics by density operators.\nAlthough mixed states can, as I said, be used to represent our ignorance of the states of systems that are actually in one or another pure state, and although this has seemed to many to be an adequate way of interpreting mixtures in classical contexts, there are serious obstacles to applying it generally to quantum mechanical mixtures. These are left for detailed discussion in the other entries on quantum mechanics in the Encyclopedia.\nEverything that has been said about observables, strictly speaking, applies only to the case in which the values of the observable form a discrete set; the mathematical niceties that are needed to generalize it to the case of continuous observables are complicated, and raise problems of a more technical nature. These, too, are best left for detailed discussion.\nThis should be all the initial preparation one needs to approach the philosophical discussion of quantum mechanics, but it is only a first step. The more one learns about the relationships among and between vectors and operators in Hilbert space, about how the spaces of simple systems relate to those of complex ones, and about the equation which describes how state-vectors move through the space, the better will be one's appreciation of both the nature and the difficulty of the problems associated with the theory. The funny backwards thing about quantum mechanics, the thing that makes it endlessly absorbing to a philosopher, is that the more one learns, the harder the problems get.\nBibliography\nQuantum Mechanics Textbooks\nThere are a great many textbooks available for studying quantum mechanics.

This is known as the Collapse Postulate. Which particular B-eigenstate it collapses into is a matter of probability, and the probabilities are given by a rule known as Born's Rule:\nprob( b i) = |<A|B=b i>| 2.\nThere are two important points to note about these two kinds of contexts:\nThe distinction between contexts of type 1 and 2 remains to be made out in quantum mechanical terms; nobody has managed to say in a completely satisfactory way, in the terms provided by the theory, which contexts are measurement contexts, and\nEven if the distinction is made out, it is an open interpretive question whether there are contexts of type 2; i.e., it is an open interpretive question whether there are any contexts in which systems are governed by a dynamical rule other than Schr\u00f6dinger's equation.\n4. Structures on Hilbert Space\nI remarked above that in the same way that all the information we have about the relations between locations in a city is embodied in the spatial relations between the points on a map which represent them, all of the information that we have about the internal relations among (and between) states and quantities in quantum mechanics is embodied in the mathematical relations among the vectors and operators which represent them.[ 10 ] From a mathematical point of view, what really distinguishes quantum mechanics from its classical predecessors is that states and quantities have a richer structure; they form families with a more interesting network of relations among their members.\nAll of the physically consequential features of the behaviors of quantum mechanical systems are consequences of mathematical properties of those relations, and the most important of them are easily summarized:\n(P1) Any way of adding vectors in a Hilbert space or multiplying them by scalars will yield a vector that is also in the space. In the case that the vector is normalized, it will, from (3.1), represent a possible state of the system, and in the event that it is the sum of a pair of eigenvectors of an observable B with distinct eigenvalues, it will not itself be an eigenvector of B, but will be associated, from (3.4b), with a set of probabilities for showing one or another result in B-measurements.\n(P2) For any Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space, there are others, on the same space, with which it doesn't share a full set of eigenvectors; indeed, it is easy to show that there are other such operators with which it has no eigenvectors in common.\nIf we make a couple of additional interpretive assumptions, we can say more. Assume, for instance, that\n(4.1) Every Hermitian operator on the Hilbert space associated with a system represents a distinct observable, and (hence) every normalized vector, a distinct state, and\n(4.2) A system has a value for observable A if, and only if, the vector representing its state is an eigenstate of the A-operator. The value it has, in such a case, is just the eigenvalue associated with that eigenstate.[ 11 ]\nIt follows from (P2), by (3.1), that no quantum mechanical state is an eigenstate of all observables (and indeed that there are observables which have no eigenstates in common), and so, by (3.2), that no quantum mechanical system ever has simultaneous values for all of the quantities pertaining to it (and indeed that there are pairs of quantities to which no state assigns simultaneous values).\nThere are Hermitian operators on the tensor product H1\u2297H2 of a pair of Hilbert spaces H1 and H2 ... In the event that H1 and H2 are the state spaces of systems S1 and S2, H1\u2297H2 is the state-space of the complex system (S1+S2). It follows from this by (4.1) that there are observables pertaining to (S1+S2) whose values are not determined by the values of observables pertaining to the two individually.\nThese are all straightforward consequences of taking vectors and operators in Hilbert space to represent, respectively, states and observables, and applying Born's Rule (and later (4.1) and (4.2)), to give empirical meaning to state assignments. That much is perfectly well understood; the real difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics lies in coming to grips with their implications \u2014 physical, metaphysical, and epistemological.\nThere is one remaining fact about the mathematical structure of the theory that anyone trying to come to an understanding about what it says about the world has to grapple with. It is not a property of Hilbert spaces, this time, but of the dynamics, the rules that describe the trajectories that systems follow through the space. From a physical point of view, it is far more worrisome than anything that has preceded. For, it does much more than present difficulties to someone trying to provide an interpretation of the theory, it seems to point either to a logical inconsistency in the theory's foundations.\nSuppose that we have a system S and a device S* which measures an observable A on S with values {a1, a2, a3...}. Then there is some state of S* (the \u2018ground state\u2019), and some observable B with values {b1, b2, b3...} pertaining to S* (its \u2018pointer observable\u2019, so called because it is whatever plays the role of the pointer on a dial on the front of a schematic measuring instrument in registering the result of the experiment), which are such that, if S* is started in its ground state and interacts in an appropriate way with S, and if the value of A immediately before the interaction is a1, then B's value immediately thereafter is b1. If, however, A's value immediately before the interaction is a2, then B's value afterwards is b2; if the value of A immediately before the interaction is a3, then B's value immediately after is b3, and so on. That is just what it means to say that S* measures A. So, if we represent the joint, partial state of S and S* (just the part of it which specifies the value of [A on S & B on S*], the observable whose values correspond to joint assignments of values to the measured observable on S and the pointer observable on S*) by the vector |A=ai>s|B=b i>s*, and let \"\u2192\" stand in for the dynamical description of the interaction between the two, to say that S* is a measuring instrument for A is to say that the dynamical laws entail that,\n|A= a 1> s|B=ground state> s* \u2192 |A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s*\n|A=a2>s|B=ground state>s* \u2192 |A=a2>s|B=b2> s*\n|A=a3>s|B=ground state>s* \u2192 |A=a3>s|B=b3> s*\nand so on.[ 12 ]\nIntuitively, S* is a measuring instrument for an observable A just in case there is some observable feature of S* (it doesn't matter what, just something whose values can be ascertained by looking at the device), which is correlated with the A-values of systems fed into it in such a way that we can read those values off of S*'s observable state after the interaction. In philosophical parlance, S* is a measuring instrument for A just in case there is some observable feature of S* which tracks or indicates the A-values of systems with which it interacts in an appropriate way.\nNow, it follows from (3.1), above, that there are states of S (too many to count) which are not eigenstates of A, and if we consider what Schr\u00f6dinger's equation tells us about the joint evolution of S and S* when S is started out in one of these, we find that the state of the pair after interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of [A on S & B on S*]. It doesn't matter what observable on S is being measured, and it doesn't matter what particular superposition S starts out in; when it is fed into a measuring instrument for that observable, if the interaction is correctly described by Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, it follows just from the linearity of the U in that equation, the operator that effects the transformation from the earlier to the later state of the pair, that the joint state of S and the apparatus after the interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of this observable on the joint system.\nSuppose, for example, that we start S* in its ground state, and S in the state\n1/\u221a2|A= a 1> s| + 1/\u221a2|A= a 2> s\nIt is a consequence of the rules for obtaining the state-space of the composite system that the combined state of the pair is\n1/\u221a2|A=a1>s|B=ground state>s* + 1/\u221a2|A=a2>s|B=ground state>s*\nand it follows from the fact that S* is a measuring instrument for A, and the linearity of U that their combined state after interaction, is\n1/\u221a2|A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s* + 1/\u221a2|A= a 2> s|B= b 2> s*\nThis, however, is inconsistent with the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2, for the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2 (and if there are any such contexts, this is one) entails that the state of the pair after interaction is either\n|A= a 1> s|B= b 1> s*\nor\n|A=a2>s|B=b2> s*\nIndeed, it entails that there is a precise probability of 1/2 that it will end up in the former, and a probability of 1/2 that it will end up in the latter.\nWe can try to restore logical consistency by giving up the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2 (or, what amounts to the same thing, by denying that there are any such contexts), but then we have the problem of consistency with experience.

Understanding its unusual properties - such as superposition and entanglement - has been an important topic of research since the theory's development early last century.

Anticipated future quantum technologies include quantum communication, which offers perfectly secure communication; quantum metrology, which allows more precise measurements than could ever be achieved without quantum mechanics; quantum lithography, which could enable fabrication of devices with features much smaller than the wavelength of light; and quantum computing, which promises exponentially faster computation for particular tasks.\nPhotons make excellent quantum bits or qubits (two level quantum systems) since they are well isolated from the environment and their quantum mechanical state can be easily manipulated.

According to the EPR proposal this is achieved by making use of a system of two correlated particles (1 and 2) that are far apart after having interacted during preparation by a source 23 . Their initial state is an entangled state . A measurement procedure is considered in which only particle 1 is interacting with a measuring instrument (see figure 8). It is assumed that the state vector of the two-particle system is such that the positions of particles 1 and 2 are strictly correlated. Then, from a measurement of particle 1's position (Q1) the value of particle 2's position (Q2) can be inferred.\nSince the position of particle 2 can be predicted with certainty, and can be determined without interaction with particle 2, it is assumed to be an element of physical reality, that is, a property the object objectively possesses, independent of any measurement. Such an `element of physical reality' is yielding an explanation by determinism of the `experimentally obtained value of a quantum mechanical observable' (in the sense that the object is supposed to already possess that value before the measurement, compare the possessed values principle ).\nThe state of the two-particle system is chosen such that not only the positions of the particles but also their momenta are strictly correlated. By measuring the momentum (P1) of particle 1 it is therefore possible to determine the momentum (P2) of particle 2 without interacting with the latter particle. Therefore also momentum is assumed to be an `element of physical reality' of particle 2.\nSince particle 2 cannot \"know\" which observable of particle 1 has been chosen to be measured, position and momentum must simultaneously be objective properties of particle 2.\nEPR conclude that, since within the quantum mechanical formalism there does not exist any mathematical entity that can represent a state having sharp values of the two incompatible observables position and momentum (of particle 2), quantum mechanics must be incomplete.\nRemarks on the EPR reasoning:\nNote that the notion of an `element of physical reality' as used in the EPR paper (viz. as an `objectively possessed value of a quantum mechanical observable') is potentially applicable only in the objectivistic-realist interpretation of quantum mechanics, since in the contextualistic-realist and empiricist interpretations measurement results are thought to be possibly (co-)determined by the interaction with the measuring instrument; in the empiricist interpretation a measurement result for particle 2 does not even exist because there is no measuring instrument corresponding to that observable (compare the distinction between EPR and EPR-Bell experiments). Bohr's attempt at a refutation of the EPR challenge, as contained in Bohr's answer to EPR , hinges on the possibility of a contextualistic-realist interpretation of quantum mechanical observables, in which the possessed values principle is circumvented as a consequence of the ` contextual meaning of a quantum mechanical measurement result'.\nSince position and momentum have continuous spectra they pose mathematical problems that are not essential but are didactically undesirable ( compare ), the problem is usually discussed in terms of Bohm's formulation using spin observables 5 , for both particles the observables Q and P being replaced by Sz and Sx, respectively. As the entangled state then is taken the singlet state\n|\u03a8(S = 0)>\n|S1z = + >|S2z = \u2212 > \u2212 |S1z = \u2212> |S2z = + > =\n|S1x = + >|S2x = \u2212 > \u2212 |S1x = \u2212 >|S2x = + >,\nbeing entangled both with respect to the Sz and the Sx observables of the two particles.\nMore generally, the gist of the EPR problem is represented by a two-particle state described by a state vector that is entangled in two different representations:\n|\u03a8> = \u2211 m c m|a 1m>|a 2m> = \u2211 n d n|b 1n>|b 2n>,\nin which |a1m> and |a2m> are eigenvectors of observables A1 and A2, respectively (and analogously for |b1n> and |b2n> with respect to observables B1 and B2). The essential point is the strict correlations between on one hand values of A1 and A2, and on the other hand between B1 and B2, Ai and Bi being incompatible for i = 1,2.\nBohr's answer to EPR\nBohr's answer to EPR is based on the `Copenhagen interpretation', viz. the strong correspondence principle (stating that physical quantities are only defined within the context of the measurement serving to measure it), the quantum postulate (emphasizing a certain `wholeness' of a quantum phenomenon ), and complementarity . According to Bohr in the EPR experiment the phenomenon must include the measurement arrangement for particle 1, even if the measurement is only regarding particle 2. Since measurement arrangements for position and momentum of particle 1 are mutually exclusive (due to the incompatibility of these observables) they cannot be simultaneously measured. Hence, the strictly correlated observables (position and momentum of particle 2) cannot be `simultaneously defined'. As Bohr puts it: there is an essential ambiguity in the definition of the EPR elements of physical reality (of position and momentum of particle 2), because these are defined within different experimental contexts.\nCritique of Bohr's answer to EPR\nAccording to Bohr 66 in analyzing the EPR experiment no essential difference is met from the usual way the notion of `complementarity' is applied to quantum measurements like the double-slit experiment. However, since this judgment is based on the `(semi-)objective existence of the strict correlations between measurement results of the two particles of the EPR pair' criticized here , this judgment does not seem warranted. Indeed, the circumstance of `strict correlation' is alien to the \"simple examples\" previously discussed by Bohr. It plays a crucial role in the EPR reasoning, and it is overlooked by Bohr that it can only be consistently applied to EPR-Bell experiments (in which for each EPR pair both measurement results are available). Probably Bohr's oversight in this matter is caused by his ` classical way of thinking about quantum mechanical observables', inducing him to extend `classical objectivity' to quantum mechanical quantities.\nAccording to Jammer the EPR problem has forced Bohr to change his interpretation from an interactional to a relational one. Not only the interaction between the microscopic object and the measuring instrument (for particle 1) is thought to be instrumental in defining the `element of physical reality' of particle 2, but also the correlation of the quantities of the two particles. Thus,\nrelation = interaction + correlation,\nonce again illustrating the difference with Bohr's earlier emphasis on `interaction of microscopic object and measuring instrument'.\nThe nonlocality conundrum\nIt was realized by Einstein that this relationalism was introducing a feature of nonlocality into the Copenhagen interpretation: the measuring instrument for particle 1 is contributing to the definition of the `element of physical reality' of particle 2 evidently in a nonlocal way. This so-called EPR nonlocality was unacceptable to Einstein, who referred to it as \"spooky action-at-a-distance.\" Its ontological status has been much debated, giving rise to paradoxical ideas awarding it the status of a `conundrum'.\nAn alternative to Bohr's correspondence reasoning, based on a consideration of states rather than observables, but also yielding `EPR nonlocality', makes use of the ` individual-particle aspect of the Copenhagen interpretation'. An individual-particle interpretation of the EPR experiment requires that, since the position observable Q1 of particle 1 is well-defined as soon as Q1 has been measured (compare figure 8 ), the state vector of particle 2 must change discontinuously to the corresponding eigenvector (this, of course, can only be approximately so in case of a continuous spectrum). This discontinuous change (often interpreted as strong von Neumann projection , cf. Publ. 16 and Publ. 57 ) must have been brought about in a nonlocal way by the measurement of particle 1, since it would happen simultaneously with a measurement event taking place far away.\nIt was Einstein's conviction that the EPR experiment can be understood in a local way if the state vector is not considered a description of an individual object but of an ensemble . Then the discontinuous change of the particle 2 state vector can be understood as a selection of a subensemble, which does not seem to imply any real influence on particle 2 by the measurement of particle 1 (however, compare ).\n`Bohr's answer to EPR' is not consistent with his `correspondence principle (strong form)'\nIt has seldom been noticed that Bohr's answer, being based on the strong form of his correspondence principle , is actually inconsistent (see Publ. 16 ). It assumes that the correlation between the positions of particles 1 and 2 (as well as the correlation between their momenta) is well-defined independent of whether this correlation is measured or not. However, these correlations are described by quantum mechanical observables (Q1Q2 and P1P2, respectively), and, according to the `strong correspondence principle', should be defined only within the contexts of measurements of these observables. Hence, Bohr's answer can only be consistently applied within an experimental context in which a measurement is performed on both particles. A consistent rebuttal of the EPR challenge by Bohr would have denied the definability, within the proposed EPR experiment, of the `correlations employed by EPR to prove the incompleteness of quantum mechanics'. That Bohr did not do so presumably is a consequence of his realist interpretation of quantum mechanical observables , the only difference with Einstein being that Bohr's `realist interpretation' was not an objectivistic but a contextualistic one.\nBohr actually accepted the EPR measurement arrangement as a joint measurement of an observable of particle 1 and the correlated observable of particle 2. This acceptance probably is a consequence of the Copenhagen confusion of preparation and measurement .\nBohr's acceptance of the EPR proposal as a measurement of a particle 2 observable (for instance, Q2, if Q1 is measured) also brings him in conflict with complementarity : it would enable a simultaneous measurement of Q2 and P2; indeed, since Q1 and P2 are compatible, it is possible to measure these observables without any mutual disturbance (see figure 9).\nfigure 9\nThen, if the Q1 measurement would be interpreted as a Q2 measurement, it would be possible to obtain in this way sharp values for both position and momentum of one and the same individual particle 2.\nFundamental difference between EPR and EPR-Bell experiments\nThe fundamental difference between the experiments of figures 8 and 9 marks the difference between the original EPR experiment and `EPR-Bell experiments (Alice measuring Q1 while Bob is measuring P2) intended to test the Bell inequality '. The fundamental difference of the two experimental arrangements (in EPR-Bell experiments measurements are performed on both particles) makes the habit of referring to EPR-Bell experiments as `EPR experiments' very undesirable. In particular, application of von Neumann's projection postulate in EPR-Bell experiments (to the effect that the state change of particle 2 would satisfy this postulate on the basis of a measurement performed on particle 1) is impossible because particle 2 would also be subjected to the `interaction with its own measuring instrument'.\nOn the other hand, it is easy to see that in both EPR and EPR-Bell experiments `von Neumann projection' is applicable to EPR experiments as a preparation principle of particle 2, conditional on the measurement result obtained for particle 1. Thus, applying the theory of conditional preparation to an EPR experiment in which observable A1 is measured in the entangled state |\u03c8> = \u2211m cm|a1m>|a2m>, we obtain as the final state of the pre-measurement the state\n|\u03a8 f> = \u2211 m c m |\u03c8 1m>|a 2m> |\u03b8 m>,\n|\u03b8m> pointer states. The states of particle 2 remain unchanged because this particle is not influenced by the measuring instrument.\nBy considering the possibility of joint measurements of the pointer observable and arbitrary observables of particles 1 and 2 it follows that the conditionally prepared state (conditional on measurement result m) is the state |\u03c81m>|a2m>, reducing to |a2m> if particle 1 is ignored. Evidently, this result coincides with the one obtained by an intuitive application of von Neumann projection to particle 2. Note, however, that this obtains only because the latter particle is not interacting with a measuring instrument (if it were, the state of particle 2 would be influenced just like particle 1's state was changed).\nNote also that for more general initial states |\u03c8> = \u2211mn cmn|a1m>|a2n> we in the same way find as the conditionally prepared state \u2211n cmn|a2n> (up to normalization), which generalizes von Neumann projection, the latter states for different values of m not even needing to be orthogonal.\nThe general `lack of distinction between EPR and EPR-Bell experiments' is a consequence of a `realist interpretation', in which no distinction is made between a measurement result as a `reading of a pointer position of a measuring instrument' and a `property of the microscopic object'. In an `empiricist interpretation' an EPR experiment simply does not yield a measurement result for particle 2. Indeed, the EPR \"paradox\" is an important reason to prefer an `empiricist interpretation' over a realist one ( compare ), even though, maybe, a consistent application of Bohr's strong correspondence principle (in which a correlation is well-defined only within a measurement of that correlation) would also allow a local contextualistic-realist interpretation in which an observable of particle i (i= 1,2) is (co-)determined by the local context of the measuring instrument of that same particle i ( compare ).\nEinstein's reaction to Bohr's answer\nAccording to Einstein the `nonlocality' inherent in Bohr's relationalism is a consequence of the latter's assumption of completeness . This would imply a trade-off of `completeness' and `locality', in the sense that, since\ncompleteness \u2192 nonlocality,\nit would logically follow that\nlocality \u2192 incompleteness.\nBoth choices (either `completeness' or `locality') are possible to the exclusion of the other one. Whereas Bohr's choice was `completeness', was Einstein's choice `locality'. It seems that, whereas Einstein was aware of the possibility that either choice could be made (although he preferred 'locality'), it seems that for Bohr only the choice of `completeness' was open ( compare ).\nCritique of Einstein's reaction\nIt should be noted that here `completeness' means completeness in the restricted sense , associated with `contextuality due to the interaction of object and measuring instrument'. Hence, in the EPR discussion `incompleteness' is associated in the first place with objectivity (i.e. noncontextuality) rather than with an ensemble interpretation of the state vector (although for Einstein the `ensemble interpretation' was crucial). Actually, the `Bohr-Einstein discussion on the interpretation of quantum mechanics' was not about whether a realist interpretation of quantum mechanics is possible (both having in mind a classically-realist notion of `physical quantity'), but rather whether a `realist interpretation of quantum mechanical observables' (assumed by both) can be objectivistic ( i.e. independent of the `observer including his measuring instrument', Einstein) or should be contextualistic (Bohr).\nAlthough in the EPR problem Einstein did not transcend the `quantum mechanical formalism', his paradigm may have been incompleteness in the wider sense , his conviction being that `the \u03c8-function is not to be understood as the description of an individual object but rather of an ensemble of such objects', each individual object being characterized by an `element of physical reality'. This has widely been interpreted as implying that the EPR discussion was about the possibility of hidden variables (rather than about the contextuality implied by the correspondence principle ).\nIt is questionable whether so many physicists, raised in the classical tradition of an `objective description of physical reality', would have chosen Bohr's side if Einstein would have stressed the `objectivity versus contextuality' antagonism rather than the issue of whether the state vector describes an individual particle or an ensemble ( compare ). As a result of the confusion between `completeness in the wider sense' and `completeness in the restricted sense' Einstein's opposition was widely interpreted as `yielding to the lure of metaphysics' as implied by the assumption of `incompleteness in the wider sense'.\nPossibility of `additional assumptions (loopholes)'\nIt is important to note that the logical reasoning employed in Einstein's reaction to Bohr's answer , viz.\n(a \u2192 b) \u2192 (not b \u2192 not a),\nis valid only if there are no additional features contributing to the realization of b. If there is such an additional feature c, then we have\n((a and c) \u2192 b) \u2192 (not b \u2192 (not a or not c)),\nand the conclusion `not a' cannot be drawn.\nIn the EPR discussion an additional assumption exists, viz. the assumption of a ` realist interpretation of quantum mechanical observables'. Both Bohr and Einstein agreed on that ( compare ). Hence, instead of `completeness \u2192 nonlocality', we have\ncompleteness and realist interpretation \u2192 nonlocality\nIt is logically possible that the assumption of locality does not entail `incompleteness' but rather the impossibility of a `realist interpretation of quantum mechanical observables'.\nActually, Einstein's expectation that an assumption of `incompleteness of quantum mechanics' is sufficient to save `locality' in an objectivistic-realist interpretation, does not come true. It is not possible to consider conditional preparation of particle 2 in the EPR experiment as a mere selection of a subensemble, particles 2 having values of quantum mechanical observables already before the particle 1 measurement is carried out ( as assumed by EPR ). The reason for this is the invalidity of the possessed values principle . The failure of this principle entails the impossibility of a simultaneous existence of all possible EPR elements of physical reality . In this respect Bohr's allegation of `ambiguity of the EPR element of physical reality' was completely justified: since it is impossible to assume that all particle 2 observables had their values already before the measurement, a realist interpretation of quantum mechanical observables in the EPR experiment is virtually forced into a nonlocal contextualism in which the measurement of a particle 1 observable influences the reality of particle 2 in such a way that the correlated observable can obtain a certain value.\nNevertheless, Bohr's reasoning is not cogent since there is an alternative to Bohr's `contextualistic-realist interpretation', viz. the assumption that this interpretation is not applicable to the EPR experiment because in that experiment no measurement is carried out on particle 2, and hence, contrary to Bohr's assumption, observables of that particle are not well-defined ( compare ). Due to the `fundamental difference between EPR and EPR-Bell experiments', causing the experimental contexts of these experiments to be fundamentally different ( compare ), `nonlocal contextuality' is not at all enforced in an `empiricist interpretation': only the local contexts of the particles need to be taken into account.\n` EPR nonlocality ' and experiment\nContrary to a widespread belief nonlocality has not been experimentally demonstrated. On the contrary, measurements like the bi-local ones performed by Aspect et al. exhibit quantum mechanical locality in the sense that in correlation measurements like the one of figure 9 the measurement results of one observable (Q1, say) are independent of which observable of particle 2 is measured jointly (e.g. P2). This is sometimes called `parameter independence'; it is consistent with `compatibility of the observables measured jointly' (c.q. the principle of local commutativity of `local quantum field theory').\nOf course, in case of `parameter independence' there may be `outcome dependence', to the effect that the individual outcome of the measurement on particle 1 depends on the individual outcome of the measurement on particle 2 (and vice versa). `Outcome dependence' could have different causes. It could be a consequence of\ni) a nonlocal interaction, instantaneously influencing one particle if a measurement is performed on the other one;\nii) a previous interaction of the particles, by which the two-particle object has been prepared in a correlated state of the two particles.\nFrom a physical point of view the explanation of `correlation of the measurement results by means of a nonlocal interaction' is extremely implausible. The reason for this implausibility is the experimental corroboration of `parameter independence', implying that the marginals of the joint probability distribution of a joint measurement are independent of whatever happens to the other particle. This means that, if the individual objects of a pair would interact nonlocally, then the effects of this interaction would cancel on the statistical level, so as to become unobservable to any quantum mechanical measurement. This is sometimes referred to as a `peaceful coexistence' (of `individual nonlocality' and `statistical locality'). Although such a `peaceful coexistence' is logically possible, it is highly improbable. It could only be understood on the basis of a kind of cosmic conspiracy, washing out any experimental trace of `nonlocality on the individual level', so as to make it consistent with `locality on the statistical level of the quantum mechanical ensemble'. `Individual nonlocality' is reminiscent of the 19th century world aether, also perfectly hiding itself to any attempt at approaching it in an operational way. Since there is no empirical evidence supporting `individual nonlocality' (not even by the Aspect measurements!), it seems preferable to deal with it in the same way Einstein dealt with the world aether.\nRemarks on `EPR nonlocality'\nOrigin of `EPR nonlocality'\nThe ultimate source of the idea of `EPR nonlocality' is Bohr's application of his notion of quantum phenomenon to the EPR experiment, often associated with the the idea of entanglement .\nA form of `nonlocality' is also implied by a ` realist individual-particle interpretation of the quantum mechanical formalism', in which it is assumed that in the original EPR experiment of figure 8 an individual measurement on particle 1 instantaneously influences particle 2 so as to cause strong von Neumann projection of its state. According to Einstein the latter `nonlocality problem' can be solved by abandoning the individual-particle interpretation (to be associated with `completeness of quantum mechanics') in favour of a `(realist) ensemble interpretation' (representing `incompleteness of quantum mechanics'), `strong von Neumann projection' representing a transition to a subensemble ( compare ).\nDubious role of the `possessed values principle'\nProblems with respect to the `possessed values principle' cast strong doubts on Einstein's `ensemble solution' of the `EPR nonlocality' problem: 70 it is not possible to attribute in an objective sense, independent of any measurement, to each individual particle 2 a well-defined value of both Q2 and P2. Bohr was right when observing that `the ensemble Einstein needs for his reasoning' does not seem to exist (by Bohr this is cast in terms of ambiguity of the definition of the EPR `element of physical reality').\nThis need not imply, however, that Bohr's `contextuality solution' (entailing `EPR nonlocality') is the compulsory alternative. Bohr and Einstein shared a realist interpretation of quantum mechanical observables, the only difference being whether a particle possesses a value of an observable objectively (Einstein), or only contextually (Bohr). According to Bohr the mutual exclusiveness of the measurement arrangements of incompatible observables of particle 1 would prevent simultaneous attribution of values to incompatible observables of particle 2. Bohr's solution implies that the `possessed values principle' is circumvented, however, at the expense of introducing `nonlocality'.\nIt seems to me that the solutions of Einstein and Bohr, being equally metaphysical, are equally unacceptable: neither Einstein's `element of physical reality' nor Bohr's `nonlocality' has directly observable consequences.\nThere is a third possibility, viz. an empiricist interpretation , in which a particle cannot simultaneously possess values of incompatible observables because it cannot possess values of quantum mechanical observables at all (since observables refer to the `measuring instrument' rather than to the `microscopic object'). A value of an observable of particle 2 is well-defined only if a `measuring instrument for measuring that observable' is actually present (like in the experiment of figure 9 ). In the `empiricist interpretation' it is necessary to draw a clear distinction between `EPR experiments' and EPR-Bell experiments , in `EPR experiments' quantum mechanical observables of particle 2 being undefined because it is a `preparation' rather than a `measurement' of that particle.\nIt should be noted that, since in the EPR experiment of figure 8 we do not have a measurement of particle 2 but a preparation, there is no objection to a von Neumann projection as such, since it can be interpreted as a conditional preparation (compare Publ. 57 ; this, of course, is strictly true only for observables having discrete spectra). Because of the strict correlation in the initial two-particle state, and due to the fact that the state of particle 2 is not influenced by the measurement on particle 1, von Neumann projection even turns out to be applicable to EPR as if it were a first kind measurement of the particle 2 observable. This, incidentally, may have contributed to the interpretation of the `EPR experiment' as a `measurement of particle 2', making Bohr unjustifiedly think that it was allowed to apply his quantum postulate also to that particle.\nNote that a confusion of `preparation' and `measurement', as observed here, is impossible in an empiricist interpretation , because in that interpretation a quantum mechanical observable is a representation of a `measuring instrument/procedure'. In the EPR proposal of figure 8 no measuring instrument for particle 2 is present. If a `measurement result' corresponds to a `final pointer position of a measuring instrument', then that measurement result cannot have been present before the measurement, and the EPR element of physical reality cannot be represented by a `quantum mechanical measurement result'.\nIn the `empiricist interpretation' the transition from the initial (correlated, entangled) state to the final (conditional) one is not a `(realist) change of the state of an individual particle', nor a `transition to a (realist) description of a subensemble', but it is just a transition to a different preparation procedure, viz. a procedure of conditional preparation , in which particles 2 are selected on the basis of the measurement results for particle 1. In order to be able to execute a conditional preparation of particle 2 by means of selection on the basis of the particle 1 measurement result, this latter result must be known to the selector. Hence, no `nonlocality problem in the Bohr/Einstein sense' can arise in an `empiricist interpretation', contrary to what is the case in a `realist individual-particle interpretation' ( compare ) or even in a `realist ensemble interpretation' ( compare ). This is an important reason to prefer an `empiricist interpretation'. If such an interpretation is entertained from the outset, then the EPR proposal does not suggest any `nonlocality'.\nRole of `strict correlations' in the `EPR experiment'\nIn the EPR proposal use is made of a special state vector warranting strict correlations (if measured) between Q1 and Q2, and between P1 and P2, respectively. Such strict correlations are unexpected if each of the particles would behave, independently of the other one, according to the irreducible indeterminism implicit in Jordan's assertion . This poses to the `Copenhagen interpretation' a `problem of explanation', addressed in the `EPR challenge'.\nTwo possible explanations of `strict correlations'\nIgnoring \"mystical\" solutions like the one presented by Zukav in his book The dancing Wu Li masters 0 (exploiting the idea of a certain `cosmic harmony', necessary to be able to understand strict correlations in EPR-Bell experiments if Jordan's assertion would be applicable), two different \"physical\" explanations of `strict correlations' use to be contemplated:\ni) the possessed values principle , to the effect that `strict correlation' is a result of its already having been created in the `process of emission of the EPR particle pair' (the individual measurement results being supposed to be created already at that stage), correlation being preserved while the particles fly apart and the observables are finally measured in faithful measurements (Einstein's explanation by determinism );\nii) nonlocal influences, strict correlation being assumed `not to have been there beforehand', but to come into being by means of strong von Neumann projection , the measurement of particle 1 in a nonlocal way realizing the value of the (correlated) observable of particle 2 (compare e.g. Publ. 57 ). This is the Copenhagen interpretation's `explanation by nonlocal influencing'.\nBoth solutions have their drawbacks. Thus, as we know now, the `possessed values principle' cannot be maintained (also here ). So, Einstein's explanation does not work properly. For the majority of physicists this may have been reason enough to reject ( yet too hastily ) Einstein's proposal, and accept the Copenhagen solution.\nHowever, also the Copenhagen solution is not very attractive. Thus, by Einstein the Copenhagen interpretation's `explanation by nonlocal influencing' is disqualified as ``spooky action at a distance.'' `Nonlocal influence on the (experimentally relevant) relative frequencies of measurement results' being unobservable, `EPR nonlocality' is as metaphysical as were in Copenhagen eyes Einstein's `elements of physical reality'.\nNote that at the time of the EPR discussion `no convincing reason to make a choice between the two (metaphysical) alternatives' was available (the Kochen-Specker theorem having been derived much later). The only `reason for the general rejection of Einstein's explanation at the time of the EPR discussion' I can think of is the large influence of logical positivism/empiricism , combined with the fact that the aspect of `nonlocality' remained relatively unnoticed for a long time (the latter becoming fashionable only as a result of Bell's work ).\nThings changed as a result of the Kochen-Specker theorem, which theorem implies that Einstein's idea of `quantum mechanical measurement results as elements of physical reality' cannot be maintained. Taking this into account a simplistic application of classical logic to the dichotomy of `determinism versus nonlocality' might seem to result in a conclusion of `EPR nonlocality'.\nNevertheless, there are physicists who, as a result of the wide acceptance of this latter conclusion by the physics community, have a bad conscience, and who look for loopholes 0 to escape from it. Such a loophole may be found in the form of an additional assumption , not explicitly mentioned but nevertheless liable to yield an alternative explanation of experimental results. A well-known loophole is the `efficiency loophole', taking into account the `inefficiency of detection processes'. However, as a result of a general belief in `nonlocality' such loopholes are often considered to be tiny, and it is generally expected that they will all be closed some day to leave `nonlocality' as the only explanation.\nIn my view this expectation is unwarranted, however, an ` explanation by determinism of strict correlations' not at all having been demonstrated to be impossible. Admittedly, in view of the Kochen-Specker theorem it is evident that such an explanation cannot be given by quantum mechanics. But perhaps we should not ask such explanations from quantum mechanics, because this theory presumably is unable to yield it, analogous to the inability of the `classical theory of rigid bodies' to explain -rather than describe- the `rigidity of a billiard ball' ( compare ). Perhaps Einstein's `elements of physical reality' are really there to explain measurement results by determinism (as well as the `strict correlations' they may exhibit), be it that these `elements' may not be described by quantum mechanics but by some subquantum theory ( compare ). Like an `atomic theory of the solid state' is able to explain the `rigidity of a billiard ball', might `strict correlations' have to find their explanation within a subquantum mechanical theory through the existence of `subquantum elements of physical reality'.\nCriticism of the assumption of `nonlocality'\n`Nonlocality' versus `incompatibility'\nIt should be realized that `nonlocality' entered the (in)completeness discussion only through the back door. The `(in)completeness discussion' is about the crucial difference between classical and quantum mechanics, statistical applications of classical mechanics being considered to yield incomplete descriptions of reality. The Copenhagen claim was that, as a result of the incompatibility of observables Q and P, in this respect quantum mechanics is fundamentally different from classical mechanics. Hence, `incompatibility of observables' is the crucial issue, distinguishing `(possibly incomplete) classical mechanics' from `(allegedly complete) quantum mechanics'.\nHow `nonlocality' replaced `incompatibility'\nIn order to challenge the Copenhagen claim of `completeness of quantum mechanics' Einstein had to deal with the question of `whether well-defined values can be simultaneously attributed to incompatible observables'. In trying to do so he was hampered by the `impossibility of simultaneously measuring incompatible observables' (compare complementarity ).\nTo circumvent this problem Einstein and co-workers considered the EPR experiment , allegedly `performing a measurement of an observable of particle 2 without interacting with it' by `measuring a compatible observable of a distant particle 1'. It was reasoned that `incompleteness of quantum mechanics' follows from the possibility of in this way `simultaneously attributing to particle 2 well-defined values of the incompatible observables Q2 and P2'. By thus relying on an ( alleged ) simultaneous measurement of distant particles `nonlocality' entered the scene.\nIt should be remembered, however, that the `nonlocality issue' is strongly dependent on which interpretation of quantum mechanics is adopted (for instance, in an `ensemble interpretation' no nonlocality follows from the EPR experiment). It seems to me that the `nonlocality issue' has distracted attention away from the problem that is really at the basis of the EPR problem, viz. incompatibility of observables. By comparing `incompatible observables' in an indirect way by means of their correlations with a `compatible observable' EPR have complicated the issue to such an extent that confusion could arise with respect to the importance of the correlation between `compatible observables' as compared to the `correlation between incompatible observables'.\nReturn to metaphysics?\nThe widely held belief in `nonlocality', based on the EPR problem as well as on later developments related with EPR-Bell experiments (in particular, those connected with the Bell inequality ), demonstrates a remarkable change with respect to the `physicist's fear of metaphysics' as compared with the ` logical positivist/empiricist one rejecting Einstein's elements of physical reality'. Experimental results being consistent with `locality of the phenomena as expressed by a general experimental satisfaction of the quantum mechanical principle of local commutativity (implying that in EPR and EPR-Bell experiments the statistical measurement results obtained for particle 1 are independent of what happens to particle 2, and vice versa) do not suggest any nonlocality. Nevertheless, nonlocality is widely thought to be there, although there is no experimental evidence for it 71 . It seems that the combined influence of Bohr, Bohm and Bell has been sufficiently strong to outweigh Einstein's opposition against `nonlocality'. It seems to me, however, that this may have rather a sociological origin than a physical one. Although by itself nowadays `taking seriously subquantum reality' is as legitimate as `taking seriously the atomic constitution of a billiard ball', does this not imply that such an endeavour is not restricted by methodological rules. Abiding as long as possible with successful general ideas like the idea of `relativistic locality/causality' seems to be one of these rules, in particular when there is a reasonable alternative (viz. `incompatibility') for giving up an elusive `nonlocality'.\nGeneralized observables and EPR-Bell experiments\nInsight into the problem of `nonlocality versus incompatibility' is gained by considering generalized EPR-Bell experiments in which the two jointly measured observables both correspond to joint nonideal measurements of incompatible standard observables . Such measurements can be used to analyze `(violation of) the Bell inequality ' by the Aspect measurements.\nFrom this analysis it becomes evident that `violation' can be interpreted as a consequence of `local mutual disturbance of the measurement results in a joint (nonideal) measurement of incompatible standard observables of the same particle' rather than as being caused by a `nonlocal disturbance of one particle due to a measurement of a (compatible) observable of the other particle ( compare )'.\nIt is important to note that in the `EPR experiment' of figure 8 no (local) disturbance of particle 2 by any measuring instrument was allowed. By setting up a measuring instrument for particle 2 the very condition for applying the EPR reasoning has been forfeited. But also Bohr's reasoning becomes obsolete because that instrument can create `its own measurement context' ( compare ). The important we can learn from analyzing EPR and EPR-Bell experiments is that Einstein's idea of `quantum mechanics as a description of an objective microscopic reality is not feasible. The domain of quantum mechanics is delimited by the impossibility to ignore the essential influence `measurement itself' is exerting on the results obtained.\nIf it comes to judging the contest between Einstein and Bohr on the `(in)completeness issue of quantum mechanics, it turns out that with respect to the `influence of measurement' Bohr's insight is unsurpassed. On the other hand, by not sufficiently distinguishing between EPR and EPR-Bell experiments Bohr has contributed to the `nonlocality conundrum' already for such a long time unnecessarily burdening the discussions on the foundations of quantum mechanics.\n"}], [{"score": 2343.396, "uuid": "1cadf893-a21a-5902-a718-7b5328dfde5d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0604wb-94-16901", "target_hostname": "www.mth.kcl.ac.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.mth.kcl.ac.uk/%7Estreater/GS.html", "page_rank": 1.1717903e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Geometro-stochastic <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em>; general relativity. <em>quantum</em> field", "snippet": "In his book on geometro-stochastic <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em>, Prugovecki argues forcefully for a new approach to fundamental <em>physics</em>.

He quotes extensively from the masters, and also from lesser people, and has a wonderful list of references. Along the way, he offers criticism of present theories and existing trends. To make the case for his new theory, he is obliged to say something about the other theories used by particle physicists: his theory is not is accordance with what Haag calls \"Einstein causality\", and Einstein is one of Prugovecki's heroes. I shall not explain, even if I could, what GS theory is; for that, buy his books! Rather, I shall try to answer his remarks about local quantum field theory and Haag's algebraic programme.\nPrugovecki argues that local commutativity \"has no physically truly meaningful relationship to the question of Einstein causality any more than... in classical relativistic theory. Indeed, in classical special relativistic theory, the commutativity of all observables is trivially satisfied\". Here, Prugovecki has put his finger on the difference between the two concepts that Haag calls \"Einstein causality\" and \"primitive causality\". I believe that Prugovecki has confused the two. According to Haag, local commutativity is needed so that a measurement of of an observable localised in a space-time region O, and the consequent reduction of the state, causes no instantaneous influence in a region O' space-like to O. In the famous paper, R. Haag and D. Kastler, \"An algebraic approach to quantum field theory\", Jour. Mathematical Phys., 5, 848-861, 1964, the authors outline a proposal as to how a local measurement can be achieved mathematically. We measure A in the region O by applying a completely positive stochastic map, denoted T(A), to the algebra of all observables, with the properties that on the local algebra in O, the dual T*(A) of T(A) agrees with the conventional result of a measurement on the vector-states; that is, it gives the reduction of the wave-packet, into the mixed state consisting of eigenvectors of A, weighted with their transition probability from the initial state. On any observable B located space-like to the space-time region involved in measuring A, T(A) has no effect: T(A)B=B. It follows that the measurement of A has no effect on the states observed in the region where B is localised. Later work showed that local commutativity, namely the condition [A,B]=0, is a necessary ingredient for the general existence of such T(A). Notice that if the observer in O not only triggered the measuring apparatus for A, but also read the result of the measurement, then the reduced state on the algebra in O would become conditioned, and only the eigenprojection with the observed eigen value would remain in the state at O. This knowledge is not available to the observer at B, so the state on the algebra at O' is still unaffected by the measurement. If O communicated the result to O' by a signal, then this information would change the state at O', and it would collapse; this can't happen if they are space-like separated. To keep track of which state is assigned by whom, we must introduce information sets and treat the problem as in game theory; the algebras generated by the indicator functions of the information sets could be called \"information algebras\". This can be generalised to non-abelian algebras in the theory of quantum games. This is suggested in my book .\nWhy did Haag call this \"Einstein causality\"? I surmise that the term is short for \"Einstein-Podolski-Rosen causality\". In their EPR paper, Einstein, Rosen and Podolski suggest a thought experiment, which, they argued, showed that quantum mechanics is not \"complete\". Part of their argument assumes that any measurement of one observable, such as A above, will also reduce the quantum state of an observer looking at B. They were forced to this conclusion, because mixed states (that is, statistical mixtures represented by density matrices) were excluded, following Einstein's dictum, \"God does not play dice\". Thus arose a misconception, wherein the \"influence\" of a measurement was alleged to travel faster than light. Thus, in \"The Emperor's New Mind\", R. Penrose asserts that the experimental set-up used in O, namely, which observable is being measured, but not the result of the experiment, is instantaneously transmitted to O'. This is not what quantum theory says. The simple non-relativistic model of two particles of spin 1/2, uses a four dimensional Hilbert space H, the tensor product of two copies of spin-1/2 spaces; the EPR state is an entangled pure state on the algebra of all observables, but is a fully mixed state (2 \u00d7 2 density matrix, equal to 1/2 of the unit matrix) when viewed by the observer of A, and also when viewed by the observer of B; and the spin observables of one particle commute with those of the other. This commutativity allows the direct construction of the map T(A) for any spin observable A of the first particle, and having the above property of not changing the state of the second. The requirement that the effect of an observation in quantum mechanics does not travel faster than light can (arguably) be said to have originated in EPR, and so might deserve the name \"Einstein causality\".\nThe other concept, primitive causality, originated in the even earlier paper, that of R. Haag and B. Schroer (\"The postulates of quantum field theory\", Journ. Mathematical, Phys., 3, 248-256, 1962). It postulates that the observables localised in a region O generate the observables in the double cone causally defined by O. This is the quantum version of the concept of \"domain of dependence\" which holds for classical fields obeying hyperbolic partial differential equations; it requires (in classical physics) that non-linear terms be local, and that the order of the equation be finite. Then the characteristics of the equation define the \"light cone\" used to define the domain of dependence (and the range of influence). It is clear that Prugovecki would have preferred this idea, rather than local commutativity, to have been called \"Einstein causality\"; primitive causality does not involve any measurement; it is designed to imply that nothing can move outside the range of influence, and in particular, for the relativistic wave equations, nothing can move faster than light. Although Einstein can be said to have stimulated ideas related to this classical concept, he did not say anything about it in the quantum context, unlike his input into EPR.\nReturning to GS, Prugovecki introduces a fundamental length (the Planck length), and abandons local commutativity. He says \"Contemporary experimental high-energy technology...is still far from being able to probe energies and distances of \"Planckian\" orders of magnitude...Hence the choice between conventional models and their GS counterparts is not one that could be made...on the basis of experiment alone.\" This bold statement is a hostage to fortune; experimentallists are very clever people, and might be able to devise an experiment to detect the violation of \"Einstein\" causality, inherent in GS. One only needs to recall Salam's model, in which the proton was assumed to be unstable, with a life-time of 1031 years. Salam presented this model at the Rutherford Lab., on the occasion of Dr. Stafford's 25 th Christmas conference. Salam said in his talk that this hypothesis had no experimental consequences: no-one was going to be able to watch a proton for that long. Nevertheless, at Kamiokande, people watched 1034 protons for 10 years, and none decayed; so the lifetime had to be revised upwards by four orders of magnitude, and it no longer served any purpose in Salam's model.\nCloser to the question, is local commutativity exact, or is it violated at Planck lengths? is a very recent observation in astronomy. A supernova, which exploded maybe 4 milliard years ago, was observed; the photons of the various colours all arrived at the same time, within the time-span of the explosion. I would have expected this, since all photons travel at the same speed. However, the BBC report on the story said that \"physicists\" expected them to arrive at different times, because \"they\" believe that photons of different colour travel at different speeds. Who are these physicists? The story starts with the work of Amelino-Camilia [\"Relativity in space-times with short-distance structure governed by an observer-independent (Planckian) length-scale\", Intern. J. Modern Phys., D11, 35-, 2002; available at the archive, gr-qc/0012051]. This analysis suggested that Einstein's relation between the mass, energy and momentum of a particle (the dispersion relation) might be changed. The theory was called \"double relativity\", because not only is the speed c the same in all inertial frames, but also Planck's length is the same: it is the unique length that does not suffer from the Lorentz contraction. Various models were constructed, in one of which a massless particle might have a speed greater than c, depending ever so slightly on its colour; then c is the speed of photons in the limit of long wave-length. This was taken up by J. Magueijo, whose book, \"Faster Than the Speed of Light: The Story of a Scientific Speculation\" (Perseus, 2003; in the UK: Heinemann) was fortuitously published at the same time as both the BBC report, and an article in the New Scientist on double relativity. The author was confident that there would be no way to test the theory for several years, until a new facility in astronomy is finished; measuring the speed of light in the lab is not accurate enough. Nevertheless, the theory was refuted in quick time, the same week in which the book appeared, by the astronomical event mentioned.\nPrugovecki makes a valid criticism of Haag's local quantum physics, which postulates that to any open set of space-time there is associated an algebra of observables; more, the operators assigned space-like separated regions are postulated to commute. Prugovecki points out that to probe small distances needs high energy, and that this cannot be made available by a small piece of apparatus lying in the region in question. It had been long understood that the operators assigned to an open set O of space-time were to represent the observables that could be measured by a piece of apparatus, switched on for a small interval of time, with the spatial extent of the apparatus lying in the space part of O during the time-interval needed for the measurement. This raison d'etre for Haag's theory has been advocated by Borchers. However, looking at a typical CERN measuring device one sees that to probe very small distances needs enormous bits of hardware. Thus, Prugovecki argues, Haag needs classical and non-relativistic concepts to give experimental meaning to localisation in small regions. In particular, the apparatus we use certainly interfers with the environment outside the causal domain of influence generated by the local observable being looked at. He concludes that local commutativity of space-like observables might not be valid for distances of the size of the Planck length.\nIn answer, we must admit that we cannot be sure that an observable assigned to a small region O can be observed from inside O. For example, who can say that we can measure the electric field, smeared with a test-function with support inside a region of space-time the size of a Planck volume, with a piece of apparatus smaller than the earth? We must provisionally weaken Haag's postulates. We could then understand that an observable A assigned to O can be observed by a large apparatus, but which still occupies a finite volume of space-time. Since the measurement cannot interfere with any other, B say, made at a large enough distance, we must then postulate that the commutator [A,B] vanishes for all B located far enough away. In GS, such commutators, albeit very small, are not zero. Prugovecki claims that no experiment in the forseeable future will be able to detect this violation of (Haag's) Einstein causality, or to show that it does not happen. Perhaps a clever astronomer will be able to show this to be too pessimistic.\nGo to my HOME PAGE for links to my research, co-authors and other friends.\n\u00a9 by Ray Streater, 24/02/2003.\n"}, {"score": 2343.1594, "uuid": "f8cf7a15-5a16-59d4-a3e9-518fd81083d6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1307wb-15-03098", "target_hostname": "networkologies.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "https://networkologies.wordpress.com/2009/11/28/mediology-at-the-quantum-scale-quantum-physics-and-object-oriented-onticology/", "page_rank": 1.1745173e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "Mediology at <em>the</em> <em>Quantum</em> Scale: <em>Quantum</em> <em>Physics</em> <em>and</em> Object-Oriented Onticology", "snippet": "For it <em>is</em> via objects that <em>the</em> world <em>is</em> medium to itself. 6 Responses to \u201cMediology at <em>the</em> <em>Quantum</em> Scale: <em>Quantum</em> <em>Physics</em> <em>and</em> Object-Oriented Onticology\u201d Christopher Vitale, over at <em>the</em> new blog Networkologies, has a nice post up discussing OOO <em>and</em> <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em>, referring to some of my early claims", "explanation": null, "document": "Online Home of Christopher Vitale, Assistant Professor, Media and Critical/Visual Studies, Pratt Institute.\nMediology at the Quantum Scale: Quantum Physics and Object-Oriented\u00a0Onticology\ncrossposted at Orbis Mediologicus\nIn several recent posts I\u2019ve mentioned quantum issues, and the manner in which they relate to mediological and networkological concerns, in passing. But quantum physics is a body of knowledge much used and abused by those who like to speculate about the constitution of matter. And so, I\u2019d like to put a little meat on the bones of these quantum references.\nBefore doing so, however, its worth reviewing what the stakes are to mediological/networkological analysis (and for more on these approaches, please see What is Mediology? or Networkologies \u2013 A Manifesto ). In a recent post called World As Medium, I argued, following Whitehead, that the world is a medium to itself, in that self-differing substance gives rise to a multiplicity of positions for its own self-experiencing. The \u2018distance\u2019 between these points are what Whitehead calls \u2018extension\u2019, and space, time, and spacetime are differing forms of abstraction thereof. Extension is then that which creates separate positions within experience, it is that which makes all positions upon the world non-identical.\nQuantum particles, however, seem largely exempt at small scales from the separations within extension \u2013 at least when they are in a pure, undisturbed state, one called coherence by most physicists. That is, until they decohere, quantum phenomena do not exist localized in space and time the way we normally think of large, or \u2018macroscopic\u2019 entities, as existing. One of the descriptions used to describe this state is that of smearing \u2013 coherent quantum phenomena are smeared over areas of time and space. This is why, for example, electrons are often depicted as clouds, in that it is only when these clouds interact with something else that they take up specific positions in space and time. Until that point, they float, are smeared, etc. \u2013 take your pick of metaphor, the point is, they aren\u2019t anything near what we consider normal for objects we encounter in daily life.\ntwo depictions of electron clouds within an atom.\nThis distinction also gives body to the famous \u2018wave-particle\u2019 duality that high-schoolers are taught about the realm of the quantum. That is, when localized in spacetime, quantum phenomena behave as particles (as described by Heisenberg\u2019s matrix-mechanical model), but at other times, like waves (as described by Schroedinger\u2019s wave-mechanical model). Whether or not the quantum phenomena are smeared or localized depends on the extent to which they interact with each other. Large macroscopic entities, like dogs or chairs, of course, are made up of so many entities that it is impossible for quantum particles to remain in isolation, so they are continually hauled into the \u2018actual\u2019 world. Only under conditions of extreme isolation, or in the incredibly brief moments (if we can even call them that!) between encounters with each other do quantum phenomena delocalize. This is precisely why we don\u2019t encounter things violating the constraints of spacetime on a more continual basis. Of course, under more extreme conditions, such as incredibly high gravity or incredibly high speed, the threshold level for these violations increases, such at ever larger objects can begin to violate the general laws of space and time, for it is precisely under these extreme conditions that, as many have said, space and time begin to \u2018break down.\u2019 Of course, for quantum phenomena, space and time are only part of the story.\nWhether or not the \u2018cloud\u2019 states of quantum particles denote probability or smearing, of course, is grounds for debate, depending on whether your approach to these issues is fundamentally oriented in an ontological (ie: Heisenberg, Bohm) or epistemological (Bohr) bent. For Bohr it is only that which is observed that is real, and thus, only the particulate nature of quantum phenomena can be said to truly \u2018exist\u2019 \u2013 the rest is only speculation (and Schroedinger\u2019s equations, despite their use, are nothing but tools for prediction, rather than descriptions of some sort of ultimate reality). For Heisenberg and others, quantum \u2018potential\u2019 is in fact a very \u2018real\u2019 thing, a \u2018virtual\u2019 present and between the \u2018actual\u2019 of quantum events. [For an excellent analysis of the physics at work here from a Whiteheadian perspective, see Michael Epperson's excellent Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead].\nThese positions in physics, between the epistemological skepticists and the ontological optimists, so to speak, roughly correspond to opposing viewpoints in philosophy. That is, in philosophy, we could roughly divide these two groups into the Kantian/epistemologists, and the Spinozist-Hegelian/ontologists, or use any other set of related distinctions between those who aim to limit thought to only that which can be seen, and those which feel that one of the primary functions of thought is its own self-exceeding. These debates are highly relevant to contemporary philosophy, particularly in its most recent manifestation as Speculative Realism. Such approaches generally reject the Kantian divide, particularly its anchoring within the subject of psychology and language, and attempt to reintroduce the metaphysical questions which were previously banished by Kantianism and its more post-structuralist re-incarnations. In particular I find Graham Harman\u2019s object-oriented philosophy and Levi Bryant\u2019s approach of onticology to be of enormous import in contemporary discussions over the notion of what precisely constitutes an object. And it is here where the concerns of contemporary philosophy and the realm of the quantum coincide.\nIn order to go beyond mere invocations of the quantum, its worth going into some detail about precisely how it is that quantum phenomena exceed space and time, so let\u2019s examine two particular quantum experiments famed in their ability to confound common sense \u2013 the EPR experiment, first proposed by Einstein and two lesser known colleagues (Podolsky and Rosen), and the more recent advent of quantum eraser experiments. While both of these began as thought experiments, both were eventually realized in laboratories, but sometimes much later than their initial theoretical formulations.\nIncluded below are notes I prepared recently for my students to explain these two experiments in basic terms. Please keep in mind, though, that there are many ways to \u2018realize\u2019 these experiments, and I\u2019m only giving the simplest realizations of these experiments to explain. Also, please keep in mind, I\u2019m a theorist, not a physicist, so while I hope to have presented these with technical accuracy, my larger concern is with the big-picture implications thereof:\n1. THE EPR EXPERIMENT:\na. THE SETUP: A gun shoots a particle at a splitter which splits the particle into two parts. One part goes towards an observer on the right, the other to an observer on the left, with great distance between the observers, the gun, and the splitter. Each subsequent particle can be observed in one of two ways \u2013 according to spin along its horizontal axis, or spin on its vertical axis. If you measure its verticle spin, you can get an answer of up or down. If you measure its horizontal spin, you can get an answer of left or right. Because the two particles come from one split source, if there is an up spin on one, the spin on the other must be down; likewise, if there is a right spin on one, there must be a left split on the other. But there is a catch. You cannot measure both spins at the same time, you have to do one first, then the other. And the observers are too far apart to tell each other whether they look at vertical or horizontal first.\nepr experiment\nb. THE EXPERIMENT: The observer on the left always goes first, and decides at the last minute to observe either vertical or horizontal spin first, then the other. At a time five minutes later, the observer on the right makes the same random choice, and observers either vertical or horizontal. Both write down their results, and after many trials, the two experimenters compare results. When they compare results, they notice some strange things. When the observer on the left, who always goes first, looks at vertical first and gets an \u2018up\u2019 spin, the observer on right always gets a \u2018down\u2019 spin, no matter if vertical is looked at first or second. But when horizontal is checked, the data only matches half the time, there is a random 50-50 split. That is, whichever axis is checked first (by the first observer) always matches that on the other side, while whichever is checked second (by the first observer) always goes random. That is, the first observation always matches, the second one is always random.\nc. THE PARADOX: Ok, so if there\u2019s a large distance between the two particles, farther apart than can be covered by light in the time between the readings, how do the two particles coordinate? Do they have walkie talkies? It seems like they are communicating, but if so, they have to be doing so faster than the speed of light, or jumping through some sort of wormhole or other dimension in space. Or, the quantum particles are reading our minds. Or time works backwards as well as forwards for quantum particles. Or all of the above.\nd. HOW TIME \u2018REVERSAL\u2019 FIXES THINGS: If time can \u2018work backwards (more on this in our quantum eraser discussion)\u2019, there\u2019s no issue. Go in reverse. You start off with two particles with the two different observers. They start off comparing notes. Their notes come out coordinated. After that, they shoot particles backwards into a gun. Because they are already coordinated, the particles combine nicely, and go back into the gun. Luckily, the only particles they start out with are already coordinated, but that\u2019s because they check first. Everything works out, no paradox. Thus, if time is going to be \u2018causally consistent\u2019 backwards as well as forward, only the right particles are chosen when the experiment goes backwards. This means that the experiment going forwards is ensured to work as well.\n2. THE QUANTUM ERASER EXPERIMENT:\na. PREFACE \u2013 REVIEW OF THE DOUBLE-SLIT: There are many ways to set up a quantum eraser experiment, but what I\u2019ve got below is my attempt to give you the simplest setup. The quantum eraser experiment is version of the double-slit experiment with an extra few twists. Remember in the standard double-slit experiment, you first have a single slit, which reduces a set of photons to a single stream, and after this there is a double slit, followed by a plate of photo-sensitive film. We can\u2019t be sure which slit the photons go through, and we see interference/ripple patterns on the plate of film. Because only a single file of electrons can make it through the first slit, however, the only reason why this would happen is that each photon must go through \u2018both\u2019 slits, and interfere \u2018with itself\u2019.\ndouble-slit experiment.\nb. NOW, THE TWIST \u2013 DETECTORS: But what if we put detectors before the plate with the double slits? If you do this, the detectors will tell us which slit a given photon goes through. After we send a bunch of photons through the experiment with this new setup, we don\u2019t see the ripple pattern on the film anymore. Rather, we just see two piles of blips on the plate, one in front of each slit. That is, because the detectors tell us that the photons go through one slit or the other, they can\u2019t be in two places at once, \u2018interfering\u2019 with themselves. The detectors modify what the photons do, and its like the photons seem to \u2018know\u2019 we are watching them. Really, through, by detecting the photons before the slits, we modify them, forcing them to choose one slit or the other, so they can\u2019t go in both. That\u2019s why now there\u2019s only two piles of blips on the film, instead of ripples. Its also why scientists say that quantum particles can be in more than one place at a time.\nc. NOW, THE SECOND TWIST \u2013 ERASERS: We can take this all to the next level, to see just how much photons \u2018anticipate\u2019 what we\u2019re doing, as if they can also \u2018read our minds\u2019 or \u2018see into the future\u2019. Let\u2019s put covers on top of the detectors, and a device which can erase the data in the detectors after they are recorded. That way, if we record the data, but then decide to erase it, if photons react differently when we erase the data and when we don\u2019t, then either 1) they can read our minds, 2) they can \u2018see\u2019 into the future, 3) they go backwards and forwards in time \u2018at the same time\u2019, that is, their time (or at least their sense of cause-and-effect\u2019 is bi-directional, or doesn\u2019t \u2018flow\u2019 in one direction. But why do we have to send multiple photons through the experiment for it to work?\nquantum eraser experiment\nd. WHY WE NEED A BUNCH: Well, if we send only ONE photon through the device, it doesn\u2019t tell us much. That\u2019s because tiny quantum particles don\u2019t always go where they\u2019re supposed to (remember quantum probability and the uncertainty principle!), and so you have to send many photons through any version of this experiment to get a pattern, either the ripple pattern or the two-pile pattern. Any single photon could belong to either pattern, only a bunch will tell us which pattern we really have. But how do we make sure that WE aren\u2019t influencing the experiment? That is, what if we have already made up our mind, in one way or another, before the experiment, as to whether or not we\u2019re going to erase the data or not, even if we don\u2019t tell anyone? If we can find a way to get the human aspect out of the experiment, we can make sure that photons don\u2019t \u2018read our minds\u2019, but rather, that their time is bi-directional. And that\u2019s what this experiment really aims to show.\ne. THE FINAL TWIST \u2013 RANDOMIZER: Here\u2019s how we do it. Let\u2019s put a randomizer in. Half the time, it erases the data in the detectors so that when we take the cover off, there\u2019s no data there. The other half the time, we find out whether or not the photon went up or down. So what happens when we do this? As we send a stream of photons through the experiment, we see an odd result. We don\u2019t get a ripple pattern, or a two-pile pattern. We get a pattern between the two \u2013 a new result. Which means that half the time the photon interferes with itself, the other half it doesn\u2019t, and the reason why can only be one thing \u2013 the erasing. But what does this mean?\nf. THE RESULTS: When we erase the detector data, after it is recorded, it means the photon interfered with itself. When we don\u2019t erase the data, the photon only went through one slit, producing the two-pile pattern. Now, of course, because we used a randomizer, we know that the photon didn\u2019t read our mind \u2013 because we didn\u2019t decide after the fact to erase, a computer randomizer did, so this rules out any weird theories that we used psychic \u2018influence\u2019 to alter the experiment (and yes, some have proposed this, so its important to rule it out!). So, what then DOES it mean? Photons \u2018act\u2019 as if they can \u2018see\u2019 into the future. But we know that photons don\u2019t actually \u2018know\u2019 or \u2018see\u2019 anything, that\u2019s just a way we talk about things to make it easier to understand.\ng. WHAT IT MEANS FOR US: What does it mean, then, really? That photons, and quantum particles like them, do not exist in a time that \u2018flows\u2019 in only one direction. Time for quantum particles is bi-directional, it flows from past to future and future to past. This isn\u2019t to say that the particle goes backwards in time (though some particles do this as well!), but rather that the relationship of cause-and-effect has to work in both directions. This is what the eraser experiment shows us. This is why something which happens afterwards (erasing or not erasing the data in the detectors) effects something that happens earlier (whether the photon contributes to the ripple or two-pile pattern).\nh. QUANTUM CAUSALITY: But ok, what\u2019s the difference between the particle going back in time, and its relationship of cause-and-effect being bi-directional? When a particle goes back in time, its like watching a film in reverse. It does everything backwards \u2013 and this includes its spin, so if it normally spins up, it now will spin down. And there are particles that do this \u2013 or rather, there\u2019s no difference in quantum theory between particles doing some things backwards from each other, and going backwards in time. That is, we can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re opposites or time traveling, and ultimately, it doesn\u2019t make much difference. But what we saw in the quantum eraser experiment is that the relationship of cause-and-effect is bi-directional. This is something different. In our regular world, the relationship of cause-and-effect goes in only one direction. That is, if you put a flame to a candle it will start to burn, but if you reassemble all the parts of the burnt candle, you won\u2019t necessarily get fire as the result. In the quantum world, the only things that happen are those that can go backwards as well without paradox. Or, in simpler terms, if something can\u2019t go in both directions, quantum particles won\u2019t do it. Why is this?\ni. BEYOND SPACETIME: But why? Much of this brings us back to the difference between particle-time and wave-time. When particles interact with other particles, they are \u2018observed\u2019 and change. They become \u2018real\u2019 so to speak, and can\u2019t be in more than one place at a time. But when they are acting like waves, between observations, they can be in more than one place at a time (as we saw with the double slit experiment). But here\u2019s what the quantum eraser suggests. When quantum particles aren\u2019t being \u2018observed\u2019 or \u2018interacting\u2019 with other particles or things, not only can they be in more than one place at a time, but more than one time as well. This is why sometimes scientists argue that quantum particles are \u2018smeared\u2019 across an area of space and time (spacetime). Its impossible to fully say where they are, or what time they are in, because it is like they are in many spacetimes at once. Time doesn\u2019t flow for them, which is why cause and effect has to work in more than one direction. For us large, non-quantum things, however, time flows, and so, things only have to work one-way. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve given up the quantum freedom to be in multiple places and times at at \u2018time\u2019 . . .\nWhat\u2019s the ramifications of these experiments, particularly for mediology, networkology, and object-oriented/onticological approaches to speculative realism? These experiments cast light on what it means to be an object in spacetime precisely by showing us what it might mean for an object to be beyond these constraints. They show us precisely how it is that by interacting with itself, self-differing substance mediates itself via extension in spacetime. They separate out quite distinctly what it would mean to go backwards in time versus for being outside of time, and how temporal flow and causality are two very different things.\nAll of this sheds further light on what precisely it means for something to be an object. The simplest form of object is the quantum event, which is as such because it is localized in spacetime, of which, in relation to other quantum events, it is co-constitutive. It is here that we see why it is possible to consider time and space as networks, networks of quantum events zipping in and out of spacetime. Larger objects are, of course, networks of quantum events. And as some theorists, such as Julian Barbour have argued, all macro-objects are in fact continually recreated by the flickering of the quantum events of which they are composed jostling amongst each other, continually coaxing each other into localization in spacetime. That is, each quantum event mediates those with which it interacts. Spacetime is the form this mediation takes on a larger, macroscale.\nAs many theorists have argued, time only flows because of the disequilibria of entropy in the universe we know, a residue of the big-bang. As we see for quantum phenomena, however, time only flows in this direction for those in the macroscopic world. Thus, there are in some senses two universes, the temporal and temporally smeared, spatial and spatially smeared, and the universe we know it is continually jumping between these states (even as both are changing due to the supra/temporal evolution of the universe as a whole, what Whitehead calls the \u2018creative advance\u2019 of the universe). That said, both of these states are extended, only differently. For in fact, quantum phenomena can only violate spacetime localization within the very strict confines between interacting with each other. And this is why there is talk of smearing. It is not that spacetime is abolished, only that is smeared inbetween events. The difference between smearing and true atemporal or aspatial existence, however, begins to break down as we approach extreme states, such as we see in blackholes, in which extension itself begins to collapse on itself.\na feynman diagram of a quantum event. notice there are no arrows on the lines to indicate the direction of the flow of time.\nOf course, there is something which violates the separations in the world that we know as space and time on a regular basis. And that is mind. Thought is able to unite differences across space and time differences. When we see something green, green can describe leaves on a tree that are spatially separated, or the same leaf in different moments in time. Mind is, like the quantum, able to collapse space and time, in a manner which is analogous to quantum smearing. Furthermore, as Whitehead has argued, all quantum events, because they are \u2018uncertain\u2019 to outside observers, have a degree of \u2018privacy\u2019 to them \u2013 that is, they cannot be predicted, there is what seems, at least to the outside observer, to be a fundamental randomness, at work here. Whether this is the result of indirect influence of the apprehension of the larger context by a quantum event, or simply a result of limitations of our knowledge, remains the sort of epistemological/ontological distinction we mentioned at the start of this post. But either way, it seems that there is something at least \u2018internal\u2019 to each of the most basic objects in the world. That is, there is something \u2018like\u2019 mind at work in the most basic objects in existence, something which apprehends the world around it, processes it, and reacts/decides in relation thereto. Even with other human minds, we have little other proof that they exist than this sort of behavior.\na feynman network\nThe result is that quantum mechanics does seem to endorse a quasi-Leibnizian view of the world. There is a windowless \u2018monad\u2019 or interior privacy within each basic quantum event, one which seems to resonate with the larger world, but which does not touch it directly. What does touch the world directly is, rather, the physical object that corresponds to such a monad (what many commentators on Leibniz have referred to as a monad\u2019s \u2018body\u2019, to which it is connected by what Leibniz calls the \u2018viniculum\u2019). While Leibniz argued that matter is infinitely divisible, and quantum theory postulates smallest parts (quanta) to the universe, even this seems to recently confirm Leibniz more and more. For as we build machines that can test the limits of quantum phenomenon at higher and higher energies, matter appears increasingly divisible. That is, the size of the quanta in question get smaller. Thus, we now know that many of what we once considered ultimate particles, such as protons, are in fact composed of quarks, and these very quarks, when cut apart, turn into \u2018jets\u2019 that reform into whole quarks \u2013 like earthworms, they split and regenerate. Whether or not all matter can be divided infinitely is something we\u2019ve yet to truly tell. But for us, it can at least be considered functionally infinitely divisible. And the large majority of the other Leibnizian intuitions about the physical world hold as well.\nEither way, all matter can thus be said, in a sense, to possess something like mind or proto-mind, depending on how you define mind. And from such a perspective it becomes much less problematic to wonder how it is that matter \u2018emerges\u2019 seemingly spontaneously from mind (and it is this issue which I address at length in my forthcoming manuscript The Networked Mind). That is, there\u2019s something like the potentiality for what we call mind (and perhaps other types of mind as well), all the way down to the very bedrock of what we know as matter, namely, the quantum event.\nWhat then of mind? It is perhaps an echo at a higher level, or an actualization of a virtuality present within all matter. And it is fundamental to what any notion of object today might mean. And in this sense, the emergence of what Levi Bryant calls an objecticle from its field can be seen in the emergence of a quantum event from its field \u2013 and into spacetime. For it is via objects that the world is medium to itself.\nLike this:\nBe the first to like this post.\n~ by chris on November 28, 2009.\nTags: leibniz , mediology , networkology , object-oriented philosophy , speculative realism , whitehead\n6 Responses to \u201cMediology at the Quantum Scale: Quantum Physics and Object-Oriented\u00a0Onticology\u201d\n[...] last couple of weeks.

But quantum physics is a body of knowledge much used and abused by those who like to speculate about the constitution of matter. And so, I\u2019d like to put a little meat on the bones of these quantum references.\nBefore doing so, however, its worth reviewing what the stakes are to mediological/networkological analysis (and for more on these approaches, please see What is Mediology? or Networkologies \u2013 A Manifesto ). In a recent post called World As Medium, I argued, following Whitehead, that the world is a medium to itself, in that self-differing substance gives rise to a multiplicity of positions for its own self-experiencing. The \u2018distance\u2019 between these points are what Whitehead calls \u2018extension\u2019, and space, time, and spacetime are differing forms of abstraction thereof. Extension is then that which creates separate positions within experience, it is that which makes all positions upon the world non-identical.\nQuantum particles, however, seem largely exempt at small scales from the separations within extension \u2013 at least when they are in a pure, undisturbed state, one called coherence by most physicists. That is, until they decohere, quantum phenomena do not exist localized in space and time the way we normally think of large, or \u2018macroscopic\u2019 entities, as existing. One of the descriptions used to describe this state is that of smearing \u2013 coherent quantum phenomena are smeared over areas of time and space. This is why, for example, electrons are often depicted as clouds, in that it is only when these clouds interact with something else that they take up specific positions in space and time. Until that point, they float, are smeared, etc. \u2013 take your pick of metaphor, the point is, they aren\u2019t anything near what we consider normal for objects we encounter in daily life.\ntwo depictions of electron clouds within an atom.\nThis distinction also gives body to the famous \u2018wave-particle\u2019 duality that high-schoolers are taught about the realm of the quantum. That is, when localized in spacetime, quantum phenomena behave as particles (as described by Heisenberg\u2019s matrix-mechanical model), but at other times, like waves (as described by Schroedinger\u2019s wave-mechanical model). Whether or not the quantum phenomena are smeared or localized depends on the extent to which they interact with each other. Large macroscopic entities, like dogs or chairs, of course, are made up of so many entities that it is impossible for quantum particles to remain in isolation, so they are continually hauled into the \u2018actual\u2019 world. Only under conditions of extreme isolation, or in the incredibly brief moments (if we can even call them that!) between encounters with each other do quantum phenomena delocalize. This is precisely why we don\u2019t encounter things violating the constraints of spacetime on a more continual basis. Of course, under more extreme conditions, such as incredibly high gravity or incredibly high speed, the threshold level for these violations increases, such at ever larger objects can begin to violate the general laws of space and time, for it is precisely under these extreme conditions that, as many have said, space and time begin to \u2018break down.\u2019 Of course, for quantum phenomena, space and time are only part of the story.\nWhether or not the \u2018cloud\u2019 states of quantum particles denote probability or smearing, of course, is grounds for debate, depending on whether your approach to these issues is fundamentally oriented in an ontological (ie: Heisenberg, Bohm) or epistemological (Bohr) bent. For Bohr it is only that which is observed that is real, and thus, only the particulate nature of quantum phenomena can be said to truly \u2018exist\u2019 \u2013 the rest is only speculation (and Schroedinger\u2019s equations, despite their use, are nothing but tools for prediction, rather than descriptions of some sort of ultimate reality). For Heisenberg and others, quantum \u2018potential\u2019 is in fact a very \u2018real\u2019 thing, a \u2018virtual\u2019 present and between the \u2018actual\u2019 of quantum events. [For an excellent analysis of the physics at work here from a Whiteheadian perspective, see Michael Epperson's excellent Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead].\nThese positions in physics, between the epistemological skepticists and the ontological optimists, so to speak, roughly correspond to opposing viewpoints in philosophy. That is, in philosophy, we could roughly divide these two groups into the Kantian/epistemologists, and the Spinozist-Hegelian/ontologists, or use any other set of related distinctions between those who aim to limit thought to only that which can be seen, and those which feel that one of the primary functions of thought is its own self-exceeding. These debates are highly relevant to contemporary philosophy, particularly in its most recent manifestation as Speculative Realism. Such approaches generally reject the Kantian divide, particularly its anchoring within the subject of psychology and language, and attempt to reintroduce the metaphysical questions which were previously banished by Kantianism and its more post-structuralist re-incarnations. In particular I find Graham Harman\u2019s object-oriented philosophy and Levi Bryant\u2019s approach of onticology to be of enormous import in contemporary discussions over the notion of what precisely constitutes an object. And it is here where the concerns of contemporary philosophy and the realm of the quantum coincide.\nIn order to go beyond mere invocations of the quantum, its worth going into some detail about precisely how it is that quantum phenomena exceed space and time, so let\u2019s examine two particular quantum experiments famed in their ability to confound common sense \u2013 the EPR experiment, first proposed by Einstein and two lesser known colleagues (Podolsky and Rosen), and the more recent advent of quantum eraser experiments. While both of these began as thought experiments, both were eventually realized in laboratories, but sometimes much later than their initial theoretical formulations.\nIncluded below are notes I prepared recently for my students to explain these two experiments in basic terms. Please keep in mind, though, that there are many ways to \u2018realize\u2019 these experiments, and I\u2019m only giving the simplest realizations of these experiments to explain. Also, please keep in mind, I\u2019m a theorist, not a physicist, so while I hope to have presented these with technical accuracy, my larger concern is with the big-picture implications thereof:\n1. THE EPR EXPERIMENT:\na. THE SETUP: A gun shoots a particle at a splitter which splits the particle into two parts. One part goes towards an observer on the right, the other to an observer on the left, with great distance between the observers, the gun, and the splitter. Each subsequent particle can be observed in one of two ways \u2013 according to spin along its horizontal axis, or spin on its vertical axis. If you measure its verticle spin, you can get an answer of up or down. If you measure its horizontal spin, you can get an answer of left or right. Because the two particles come from one split source, if there is an up spin on one, the spin on the other must be down; likewise, if there is a right spin on one, there must be a left split on the other. But there is a catch. You cannot measure both spins at the same time, you have to do one first, then the other. And the observers are too far apart to tell each other whether they look at vertical or horizontal first.\nepr experiment\nb. THE EXPERIMENT: The observer on the left always goes first, and decides at the last minute to observe either vertical or horizontal spin first, then the other. At a time five minutes later, the observer on the right makes the same random choice, and observers either vertical or horizontal. Both write down their results, and after many trials, the two experimenters compare results. When they compare results, they notice some strange things. When the observer on the left, who always goes first, looks at vertical first and gets an \u2018up\u2019 spin, the observer on right always gets a \u2018down\u2019 spin, no matter if vertical is looked at first or second. But when horizontal is checked, the data only matches half the time, there is a random 50-50 split. That is, whichever axis is checked first (by the first observer) always matches that on the other side, while whichever is checked second (by the first observer) always goes random. That is, the first observation always matches, the second one is always random.\nc. THE PARADOX: Ok, so if there\u2019s a large distance between the two particles, farther apart than can be covered by light in the time between the readings, how do the two particles coordinate? Do they have walkie talkies? It seems like they are communicating, but if so, they have to be doing so faster than the speed of light, or jumping through some sort of wormhole or other dimension in space. Or, the quantum particles are reading our minds. Or time works backwards as well as forwards for quantum particles. Or all of the above.\nd. HOW TIME \u2018REVERSAL\u2019 FIXES THINGS: If time can \u2018work backwards (more on this in our quantum eraser discussion)\u2019, there\u2019s no issue. Go in reverse. You start off with two particles with the two different observers. They start off comparing notes. Their notes come out coordinated. After that, they shoot particles backwards into a gun. Because they are already coordinated, the particles combine nicely, and go back into the gun. Luckily, the only particles they start out with are already coordinated, but that\u2019s because they check first. Everything works out, no paradox. Thus, if time is going to be \u2018causally consistent\u2019 backwards as well as forward, only the right particles are chosen when the experiment goes backwards. This means that the experiment going forwards is ensured to work as well.\n2. THE QUANTUM ERASER EXPERIMENT:\na. PREFACE \u2013 REVIEW OF THE DOUBLE-SLIT: There are many ways to set up a quantum eraser experiment, but what I\u2019ve got below is my attempt to give you the simplest setup. The quantum eraser experiment is version of the double-slit experiment with an extra few twists. Remember in the standard double-slit experiment, you first have a single slit, which reduces a set of photons to a single stream, and after this there is a double slit, followed by a plate of photo-sensitive film. We can\u2019t be sure which slit the photons go through, and we see interference/ripple patterns on the plate of film. Because only a single file of electrons can make it through the first slit, however, the only reason why this would happen is that each photon must go through \u2018both\u2019 slits, and interfere \u2018with itself\u2019.\ndouble-slit experiment.\nb. NOW, THE TWIST \u2013 DETECTORS: But what if we put detectors before the plate with the double slits? If you do this, the detectors will tell us which slit a given photon goes through. After we send a bunch of photons through the experiment with this new setup, we don\u2019t see the ripple pattern on the film anymore. Rather, we just see two piles of blips on the plate, one in front of each slit. That is, because the detectors tell us that the photons go through one slit or the other, they can\u2019t be in two places at once, \u2018interfering\u2019 with themselves. The detectors modify what the photons do, and its like the photons seem to \u2018know\u2019 we are watching them. Really, through, by detecting the photons before the slits, we modify them, forcing them to choose one slit or the other, so they can\u2019t go in both. That\u2019s why now there\u2019s only two piles of blips on the film, instead of ripples. Its also why scientists say that quantum particles can be in more than one place at a time.\nc. NOW, THE SECOND TWIST \u2013 ERASERS: We can take this all to the next level, to see just how much photons \u2018anticipate\u2019 what we\u2019re doing, as if they can also \u2018read our minds\u2019 or \u2018see into the future\u2019. Let\u2019s put covers on top of the detectors, and a device which can erase the data in the detectors after they are recorded. That way, if we record the data, but then decide to erase it, if photons react differently when we erase the data and when we don\u2019t, then either 1) they can read our minds, 2) they can \u2018see\u2019 into the future, 3) they go backwards and forwards in time \u2018at the same time\u2019, that is, their time (or at least their sense of cause-and-effect\u2019 is bi-directional, or doesn\u2019t \u2018flow\u2019 in one direction. But why do we have to send multiple photons through the experiment for it to work?\nquantum eraser experiment\nd. WHY WE NEED A BUNCH: Well, if we send only ONE photon through the device, it doesn\u2019t tell us much. That\u2019s because tiny quantum particles don\u2019t always go where they\u2019re supposed to (remember quantum probability and the uncertainty principle!), and so you have to send many photons through any version of this experiment to get a pattern, either the ripple pattern or the two-pile pattern. Any single photon could belong to either pattern, only a bunch will tell us which pattern we really have. But how do we make sure that WE aren\u2019t influencing the experiment? That is, what if we have already made up our mind, in one way or another, before the experiment, as to whether or not we\u2019re going to erase the data or not, even if we don\u2019t tell anyone? If we can find a way to get the human aspect out of the experiment, we can make sure that photons don\u2019t \u2018read our minds\u2019, but rather, that their time is bi-directional. And that\u2019s what this experiment really aims to show.\ne. THE FINAL TWIST \u2013 RANDOMIZER: Here\u2019s how we do it. Let\u2019s put a randomizer in. Half the time, it erases the data in the detectors so that when we take the cover off, there\u2019s no data there. The other half the time, we find out whether or not the photon went up or down. So what happens when we do this? As we send a stream of photons through the experiment, we see an odd result. We don\u2019t get a ripple pattern, or a two-pile pattern. We get a pattern between the two \u2013 a new result. Which means that half the time the photon interferes with itself, the other half it doesn\u2019t, and the reason why can only be one thing \u2013 the erasing. But what does this mean?\nf. THE RESULTS: When we erase the detector data, after it is recorded, it means the photon interfered with itself. When we don\u2019t erase the data, the photon only went through one slit, producing the two-pile pattern. Now, of course, because we used a randomizer, we know that the photon didn\u2019t read our mind \u2013 because we didn\u2019t decide after the fact to erase, a computer randomizer did, so this rules out any weird theories that we used psychic \u2018influence\u2019 to alter the experiment (and yes, some have proposed this, so its important to rule it out!). So, what then DOES it mean? Photons \u2018act\u2019 as if they can \u2018see\u2019 into the future. But we know that photons don\u2019t actually \u2018know\u2019 or \u2018see\u2019 anything, that\u2019s just a way we talk about things to make it easier to understand.\ng. WHAT IT MEANS FOR US: What does it mean, then, really? That photons, and quantum particles like them, do not exist in a time that \u2018flows\u2019 in only one direction. Time for quantum particles is bi-directional, it flows from past to future and future to past. This isn\u2019t to say that the particle goes backwards in time (though some particles do this as well!), but rather that the relationship of cause-and-effect has to work in both directions. This is what the eraser experiment shows us. This is why something which happens afterwards (erasing or not erasing the data in the detectors) effects something that happens earlier (whether the photon contributes to the ripple or two-pile pattern).\nh. QUANTUM CAUSALITY: But ok, what\u2019s the difference between the particle going back in time, and its relationship of cause-and-effect being bi-directional? When a particle goes back in time, its like watching a film in reverse. It does everything backwards \u2013 and this includes its spin, so if it normally spins up, it now will spin down. And there are particles that do this \u2013 or rather, there\u2019s no difference in quantum theory between particles doing some things backwards from each other, and going backwards in time. That is, we can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re opposites or time traveling, and ultimately, it doesn\u2019t make much difference. But what we saw in the quantum eraser experiment is that the relationship of cause-and-effect is bi-directional. This is something different. In our regular world, the relationship of cause-and-effect goes in only one direction. That is, if you put a flame to a candle it will start to burn, but if you reassemble all the parts of the burnt candle, you won\u2019t necessarily get fire as the result. In the quantum world, the only things that happen are those that can go backwards as well without paradox. Or, in simpler terms, if something can\u2019t go in both directions, quantum particles won\u2019t do it. Why is this?\ni. BEYOND SPACETIME: But why? Much of this brings us back to the difference between particle-time and wave-time. When particles interact with other particles, they are \u2018observed\u2019 and change. They become \u2018real\u2019 so to speak, and can\u2019t be in more than one place at a time. But when they are acting like waves, between observations, they can be in more than one place at a time (as we saw with the double slit experiment). But here\u2019s what the quantum eraser suggests. When quantum particles aren\u2019t being \u2018observed\u2019 or \u2018interacting\u2019 with other particles or things, not only can they be in more than one place at a time, but more than one time as well. This is why sometimes scientists argue that quantum particles are \u2018smeared\u2019 across an area of space and time (spacetime). Its impossible to fully say where they are, or what time they are in, because it is like they are in many spacetimes at once. Time doesn\u2019t flow for them, which is why cause and effect has to work in more than one direction. For us large, non-quantum things, however, time flows, and so, things only have to work one-way. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve given up the quantum freedom to be in multiple places and times at at \u2018time\u2019 . . .\nWhat\u2019s the ramifications of these experiments, particularly for mediology, networkology, and object-oriented/onticological approaches to speculative realism? These experiments cast light on what it means to be an object in spacetime precisely by showing us what it might mean for an object to be beyond these constraints. They show us precisely how it is that by interacting with itself, self-differing substance mediates itself via extension in spacetime. They separate out quite distinctly what it would mean to go backwards in time versus for being outside of time, and how temporal flow and causality are two very different things.\nAll of this sheds further light on what precisely it means for something to be an object. The simplest form of object is the quantum event, which is as such because it is localized in spacetime, of which, in relation to other quantum events, it is co-constitutive. It is here that we see why it is possible to consider time and space as networks, networks of quantum events zipping in and out of spacetime. Larger objects are, of course, networks of quantum events. And as some theorists, such as Julian Barbour have argued, all macro-objects are in fact continually recreated by the flickering of the quantum events of which they are composed jostling amongst each other, continually coaxing each other into localization in spacetime. That is, each quantum event mediates those with which it interacts. Spacetime is the form this mediation takes on a larger, macroscale.\nAs many theorists have argued, time only flows because of the disequilibria of entropy in the universe we know, a residue of the big-bang. As we see for quantum phenomena, however, time only flows in this direction for those in the macroscopic world. Thus, there are in some senses two universes, the temporal and temporally smeared, spatial and spatially smeared, and the universe we know it is continually jumping between these states (even as both are changing due to the supra/temporal evolution of the universe as a whole, what Whitehead calls the \u2018creative advance\u2019 of the universe). That said, both of these states are extended, only differently. For in fact, quantum phenomena can only violate spacetime localization within the very strict confines between interacting with each other. And this is why there is talk of smearing. It is not that spacetime is abolished, only that is smeared inbetween events. The difference between smearing and true atemporal or aspatial existence, however, begins to break down as we approach extreme states, such as we see in blackholes, in which extension itself begins to collapse on itself.\na feynman diagram of a quantum event. notice there are no arrows on the lines to indicate the direction of the flow of time.\nOf course, there is something which violates the separations in the world that we know as space and time on a regular basis. And that is mind. Thought is able to unite differences across space and time differences. When we see something green, green can describe leaves on a tree that are spatially separated, or the same leaf in different moments in time. Mind is, like the quantum, able to collapse space and time, in a manner which is analogous to quantum smearing. Furthermore, as Whitehead has argued, all quantum events, because they are \u2018uncertain\u2019 to outside observers, have a degree of \u2018privacy\u2019 to them \u2013 that is, they cannot be predicted, there is what seems, at least to the outside observer, to be a fundamental randomness, at work here. Whether this is the result of indirect influence of the apprehension of the larger context by a quantum event, or simply a result of limitations of our knowledge, remains the sort of epistemological/ontological distinction we mentioned at the start of this post. But either way, it seems that there is something at least \u2018internal\u2019 to each of the most basic objects in the world. That is, there is something \u2018like\u2019 mind at work in the most basic objects in existence, something which apprehends the world around it, processes it, and reacts/decides in relation thereto. Even with other human minds, we have little other proof that they exist than this sort of behavior.\na feynman network\nThe result is that quantum mechanics does seem to endorse a quasi-Leibnizian view of the world. There is a windowless \u2018monad\u2019 or interior privacy within each basic quantum event, one which seems to resonate with the larger world, but which does not touch it directly. What does touch the world directly is, rather, the physical object that corresponds to such a monad (what many commentators on Leibniz have referred to as a monad\u2019s \u2018body\u2019, to which it is connected by what Leibniz calls the \u2018viniculum\u2019). While Leibniz argued that matter is infinitely divisible, and quantum theory postulates smallest parts (quanta) to the universe, even this seems to recently confirm Leibniz more and more. For as we build machines that can test the limits of quantum phenomenon at higher and higher energies, matter appears increasingly divisible. That is, the size of the quanta in question get smaller. Thus, we now know that many of what we once considered ultimate particles, such as protons, are in fact composed of quarks, and these very quarks, when cut apart, turn into \u2018jets\u2019 that reform into whole quarks \u2013 like earthworms, they split and regenerate. Whether or not all matter can be divided infinitely is something we\u2019ve yet to truly tell. But for us, it can at least be considered functionally infinitely divisible. And the large majority of the other Leibnizian intuitions about the physical world hold as well.\nEither way, all matter can thus be said, in a sense, to possess something like mind or proto-mind, depending on how you define mind. And from such a perspective it becomes much less problematic to wonder how it is that matter \u2018emerges\u2019 seemingly spontaneously from mind (and it is this issue which I address at length in my forthcoming manuscript The Networked Mind). That is, there\u2019s something like the potentiality for what we call mind (and perhaps other types of mind as well), all the way down to the very bedrock of what we know as matter, namely, the quantum event.\nWhat then of mind? It is perhaps an echo at a higher level, or an actualization of a virtuality present within all matter. And it is fundamental to what any notion of object today might mean. And in this sense, the emergence of what Levi Bryant calls an objecticle from its field can be seen in the emergence of a quantum event from its field \u2013 and into spacetime. For it is via objects that the world is medium to itself.\nLike this:\nBe the first to like this post.\n~ by chris on November 28, 2009.\nTags: leibniz , mediology , networkology , object-oriented philosophy , speculative realism , whitehead\n6 Responses to \u201cMediology at the Quantum Scale: Quantum Physics and Object-Oriented\u00a0Onticology\u201d\n[...] last couple of weeks.

Among these, quantum mechanics is unique because of its profoundly radical quality. Quantum mechanics forced physicists to reshape their ideas of reality, to rethink the nature of things at the deepest level, and to revise their concepts of position and speed, as well as their notions of cause and effect.\nAlthough quantum mechanics was created to describe an abstract atomic world far removed from daily experience, its impact on our daily lives could hardly be greater. The spectacular advances in chemistry, biology, and medicine\u0097and in essentially every other science\u0097could not have occurred without the tools that quantum mechanics made possible. Without quantum mechanics there would be no global economy to speak of, because the electronics revolution that brought us the computer age is a child of quantum mechanics. So is the photonics revolution that brought us the Information Age. The creation of quantum physics has transformed our world, bringing with it all the benefits\u0097and the risks\u0097of a scientific revolution.\nUnlike general relativity , which grew out of a brilliant insight into the connection between gravity and geometry, or the deciphering of DNA, which unveiled a new world of biology, quantum mechanics did not spring from a single step. Rather, it was created in one of those rare concentrations of genius that occur from time to time in history. For 20 years after their introduction, quantum ideas were so confused that there was little basis for progress; then a small group of physicists created quantum mechanics in three tumultuous years. These scientists were troubled by what they were doing, and in some cases distressed by what they had done. The unique situation of this crucial yet elusive theory is perhaps best summarized by the following observation: Quantum theory is the most precisely tested and most successful theory in the history of science. Nevertheless, not only was quantum mechanics deeply disturbing to its founders, today\u009775 years after the theory was essentially cast in its current form\u0097some of the luminaries of science remain dissatisfied with its foundations and its interpretation, even as they acknowledge its stunning power.\nThis year marks the 100th anniversary of Max Planck's creation of the quantum concept. In his seminal paper on thermal radiation, Planck hypothesized that the total energy of a vibrating system cannot be changed continuously. Instead, the energy must jump from one value to another in discrete steps, or quanta, of energy. The idea of energy quanta was so radical that Planck let it lay fallow. Then Albert Einstein , in his wonder year of 1905, recognized the implications of quantization for light. Even then the concept was so bizarre that there was little basis for progress. Twenty more years and a fresh generation of physicists were required to create modern quantum theory.\nTo understand the revolutionary impact of quantum physics one need only look at pre-quantum physics. From 1890 to 1900 physics journals were filled with papers on atomic spectra and essentially every other measurable property of matter, such as viscosity, elasticity, electrical and thermal conductivity, coefficients of expansion, indices of refraction, and thermo-elastic coefficients. Spurred by the energy of the Victorian work ethic and the development of ever more ingenious experimental methods, knowledge accumulated at a prodigious rate.\nWhat is most striking to the contemporary eye, however, is that the compendious descriptions of the properties of matter were essentially empirical. Thousands of pages of spectral data listed precise values for the wavelengths of the elements, but nobody knew why spectral lines occurred, much less what information they conveyed. Thermal and electrical conductivities were interpreted by suggestive models that fitted roughly half the facts. There were numerous empirical laws but they were not satisfying. For instance, the Dulong-Petit law established a simple relation between specific heat and the atomic weight of a material. Much of the time it worked; sometimes it didn't. The masses of equal volumes of gas were, for the most part, in the ratios of integers. The Periodic Table , which provided a key organizing principle for the flourishing science of chemistry, had absolutely no theoretical basis.\nAmong the greatest achievements of the revolution is this: Quantum mechanics has provided a quantitative theory of matter. We now understand essentially every detail of atomic structure\u0097the Periodic Table has a simple and natural explanation, and the vast arrays of spectral data fit into an elegant theoretical framework. Quantum theory permits the quantitative understanding of molecules, of solids and liquids, and of conductors and semiconductors. It explains bizarre phenomena such as superconductivity and superfluidity, and exotic forms of matter such as the stuff of neutron stars and Bose-Einstein condensates , in which all the atoms in a gas behave like a single superatom. Quantum mechanics provides essential tools for all the sciences and for every advanced technology.\nQuantum physics actually encompasses two entities. The first is the theory of matter at the atomic level: quantum mechanics. It is quantum mechanics that allows us to understand and manipulate the material world. The second is the quantum theory of fields. Quantum field theory plays a totally different role in science, to which we shall return later.\nQuantum Mechanics\nThe clue that triggered the quantum revolution came not from studies of matter but from a problem in radiation. The specific challenge was to understand the spectrum of light emitted by hot bodies: blackbody radiation . The phenomenon is familiar to anyone who has stared at a fire. Hot matter glows, and the hotter it becomes the brighter it glows. The spectrum of the light is broad, with a peak that shifts from red to yellow and finally to blue (although we cannot see that) as the temperature is raised.\nIt should have been possible to understand the shape of the spectrum by combining concepts from thermodynamics and electromagnetic theory, but all attempts failed. However, by assuming that the energies of the vibrating electrons that radiate the light are quantized, Planck obtained an expression that agreed beautifully with experiment. But as he recognized all too well, the theory was physically absurd, \"an act of desperation,\" as he later described it.\nPlanck applied his quantum hypothesis to the energy of the vibrators in the walls of a radiating body. Quantum physics might have ended there if in 1905 a novice\u0097Einstein\u0097had not reluctantly concluded that if a vibrator's energy is quantized, then the energy of the electromagnetic field that it radiates\u0097light\u0097must also be quantized. Einstein thus imbued light with particle-like behavior, notwithstanding James Clerk Maxwell's theory, and over a century of definitive experiments testified to light's wave nature. Experiments on the photoelectric effect in the following decade revealed that when light is absorbed its energy actually arrives in discrete bundles, as if carried by a particle. The dual nature of light\u0097particle-like or wavelike depending on what one looks for\u0097was the first example of a vexing theme that would recur throughout quantum physics. The duality constituted a theoretical conundrum for the next 20 years.\nThe first step toward quantum theory had been precipitated by a dilemma about radiation. The second step was precipitated by a dilemma about matter. It was known that atoms contain positively and negatively charged particles. But oppositely charged particles attract. According to electromagnetic theory, therefore, they should spiral into each other, radiating light in a broad spectrum until they collapse.\nOnce again, the door to progress was opened by a novice: Niels Bohr . In 1913 Bohr proposed a radical hypothesis: Electrons in an atom exist only in certain stationary states, including a ground state. Electrons change their energy by \"jumping\" between the stationary states, emitting light whose wavelength depends on the energy difference. By combining known laws with bizarre assumptions about quantum behavior, Bohr swept away the problem of atomic stability. Bohr's theory was full of contradictions, but it provided a quantitative description of the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. He recognized both the success and the shortcomings of his model. With uncanny foresight, he rallied physicists to create a new physics. His vision was eventually fulfilled, although it took 12 years and a new generation of young physicists.\nAt first, attempts to advance Bohr's quantum ideas\u0097the so-called old quantum theory\u0097suffered one defeat after another. Then a series of developments totally changed the course of thinking. In 1923 Louis de Broglie , in his Ph.D. thesis, proposed that the particle behavior of light should have its counterpart in the wave behavior of particles. He associated a wavelength with the momentum of a particle: The higher the momentum, the shorter the wavelength. The idea was intriguing, but no one knew what a particle's wave nature might signify or how it related to atomic structure. Nevertheless, de Broglie's hypothesis was an important precursor for events soon to take place.\nIn the summer of 1924, there was yet another precursor. Satyendra N. Bose proposed a totally new way to explain the Planck radiation law. He treated light as if it were a gas of massless particles (now called photons) that do not obey the classical laws of Boltzmann statistics but behave according to a new type of statistics based on particles' indistinguishable nature. Einstein immediately applied Bose's reasoning to a real gas of massive particles and obtained a new law\u0097to become known as the Bose-Einstein distribution\u0097for how energy is shared by the particles in a gas. Under normal circumstances, however, the new and old theories predicted the same behavior for atoms in a gas. Einstein took no further interest, and the result lay undeveloped for more than a decade. Still, its key idea, the indistinguishability of particles, was about to become critically important.\nSuddenly, a tumultuous series of events occurred, culminating in a scientific revolution. In the three-year period from January 1925 to January 1928:\n\u0095 Wolfgang Pauli proposed the exclusion principle, providing a theoretical basis for the Periodic Table.\n\u0095 Werner Heisenberg , with Max Born and Pascual Jordan , discovered matrix mechanics, the first version of quantum mechanics. The historical goal of understanding electron motion within atoms was abandoned in favor of a systematic method for organizing observable spectral lines.\n\u0095 Erwin Schrdinger invented wave mechanics, a second form of quantum mechanics in which the state of a system is described by a wave function, the solution to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. Matrix mechanics and wave mechanics, apparently incompatible, were shown to be equivalent.\n\u0095 Electrons were shown to obey a new type of statistical law, Fermi-Dirac statistics. It was recognized that all particles obey either Fermi-Dirac statistics or Bose-Einstein statistics, and that the two classes have fundamentally different properties.\n\u0095 Heisenberg enunciated the Uncertainty Principle.\n\u0095 Paul A.M. Dirac developed a relativistic wave equation for the electron that explained electron spin and predicted antimatter.\n\u0095 Dirac laid the foundations of quantum field theory by providing a quantum description of the electromagnetic field.\n\u0095 Bohr announced the complementarity principle, a philosophical principle that helped to resolve apparent paradoxes of quantum theory, particularly wave-particle duality.\nThe principal players in the creation of quantum theory were young. In 1925 Pauli was 25 years old, Heisenberg and Enrico Fermi were 24, and Dirac and Jordan were 23. Schr\u00f6dinger, at age 36, was a late bloomer. Born and Bohr were older still, and it is significant that their contributions were largely interpretative. The profoundly radical nature of the intellectual achievement is revealed by Einstein's reaction. Having invented some of the key concepts that led to quantum theory, Einstein rejected it. His paper on Bose-Einstein statistics was his last contribution to quantum physics and his last significant contribution to physics.\nThat a new generation of physicists was needed to create quantum mechanics is hardly surprising. Lord Kelvin described why in a letter to Bohr congratulating him on his 1913 paper on hydrogen. He said that there was much truth in Bohr's paper, but he would never understand it himself. Kelvin recognized that radically new physics would need to come from unfettered minds.\nIn 1928 the revolution was finished and the foundations of quantum mechanics were essentially complete. The frenetic pace with which it occurred is revealed by an anecdote recounted by the late Abraham Pais in Inward Bound. In 1925 the concept of electron spin had been proposed by Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck. Bohr was deeply skeptical. In December he traveled to Leiden, The Netherlands, to attend the jubilee of Hendrik A. Lorentz's doctorate. Pauli met the train at Hamburg, Germany, to find out Bohr's opinion about the possibility of electron spin. Bohr said the proposal was \"very, very interesting,\" his well-known put-down phrase. Later at Leiden, Einstein and Paul Ehrenfest met Bohr's train, also to discuss spin. There, Bohr explained his objection, but Einstein showed a way around it and converted Bohr into a supporter. On his return journey, Bohr met with yet more discussants. When the train passed through G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, Heisenberg and Jordan were waiting at the station to ask his opinion. And at the Berlin station, Pauli was waiting, having traveled especially from Hamburg. Bohr told them all that the discovery of electron spin was a great advance.\nThe creation of quantum mechanics triggered a scientific gold rush. Among the early achievements were these: Heisenberg laid the foundations for atomic structure theory by obtaining an approximate solution to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation for the helium atom in 1927, and general techniques for calculating the structures of atoms were created soon after by John Slater, Douglas Rayner Hartree, and Vladimir Fock. The structure of the hydrogen molecule was solved by Fritz London and Walter Heitler; Linus Pauling built on their results to found theoretical chemistry. Arnold Sommerfeld and Pauli laid the foundations of the theory of electrons in metals, and Felix Bloch created band structure theory. Heisenberg explained the origin of ferromagnetism. The enigma of the random nature of radioactive decay by alpha particle emission was explained in 1928 by George Gamow, who showed that it occurs by quantum-mechanical tunneling. In the following years Hans Bethe laid the foundations for nuclear physics and explained the energy source of stars. With these developments, atomic, molecular, solid state, and nuclear physics entered the modern age.\nControversy and Confusion\nAlongside these advances, however, fierce debates were taking place on the interpretation and validity of quantum mechanics. Foremost among the protagonists were Bohr and Heisenberg, who embraced the new theory, and Einstein and Schr\u00f6dinger, who were dissatisfied. To appreciate the reasons for such turmoil, one needs to understand some of the key features of quantum theory, which we summarize here. (For simplicity, we describe the Schr\u00f6dinger version of quantum mechanics, sometimes called wave mechanics.)\nFundamental description: the wave function. The behavior of a system is described by Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. The solutions to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation are known as wave functions. The complete knowledge of a system is described by its wave function, and from the wave function one can calculate the possible values of every observable quantity. The probability of finding an electron in a given volume of space is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the wave function. Consequently, the location of the particle is \"spread out\" over the volume of the wave function. The momentum of a particle depends on the slope of the wave function: The greater the slope, the higher the momentum. Because the slope varies from place to place, momentum is also \"spread out.\" The need to abandon a classical picture in which position and velocity can be determined with arbitrary accuracy, in favor of a blurred picture of probabilities, is at the heart of quantum mechanics.\nMeasurements made on identical systems that are identically prepared will not yield identical results. Rather, the results will be scattered over a range described by the wave function. Consequently, the concept of an electron having a particular location and a particular momentum loses its foundation. The Uncertainty Principle quantifies this: To locate a particle precisely, the wave function must be sharply peaked (that is, not spread out). However, a sharp peak requires a steep slope, and so the spread in momentum will be great. Conversely, if the momentum has a small spread, the slope of the wave function must be small, which means that it must spread out over a large volume, thereby portraying the particle's location less exactly.\nWaves can interfere. Their heights add or subtract depending on their relative phase. Where the amplitudes are in phase, they add; where they are out of phase, they subtract. If a wave can follow several paths from source to receiver, as a light wave undergoing two-slit interference, then the illumination will generally display interference fringes. Particles obeying a wave equation will do likewise, as in electron diffraction. The analogy seems reasonable until one inquires about the nature of the wave. A wave is generally thought of as a disturbance in a medium. In quantum mechanics there is no medium, and in a sense there is no wave, as the wave function is fundamentally a statement of our knowledge of a system.\nSymmetry and identity. A helium atom consists of a nucleus surrounded by two electrons. The wave function of helium describes the position of each electron. However, there is no way of distinguishing which electron is which. Consequently, if the electrons are switched the system must look the same, which is to say the probability of finding the electrons in given positions is unchanged. Because the probability depends on the square of the magnitude of the wave function, the wave function for the system with the interchanged particles must be related to the original wave function in one of two ways: Either it is identical to the original wave function, or its sign is simply reversed; i.e., it is multiplied by a factor of -1. Which one is it?\nOne of the astonishing discoveries in quantum mechanics is that for electrons the wave function always changes sign. The consequences are dramatic, for if two electrons are in the same quantum state, then the wave function has to be its negative opposite. Consequently, the wave function must vanish. Thus, the probability of finding two electrons in the same state is zero. This is the Pauli exclusion principle. All particles with half-integer spin, including electrons, behave this way and are called fermions. For particles with integer spin, including photons, the wave function does not change sign. Such particles are called bosons. Electrons in an atom arrange themselves in shells because they are fermions, but light from a laser emerges in a single superintense beam\u0097essentially a single quantum state\u0097because light is composed of bosons. Recently, atoms in a gas have been cooled to the quantum regime where they form a Bose-Einstein condensate, in which the system can emit a superintense matter beam\u0097forming an atom laser.\nThese ideas apply only to identical particles, because if different particles are interchanged, the wave function will certainly be different. Consequently, particles behave like fermions or like bosons only if they are totally identical. The absolute identity of like particles is among the most mysterious aspects of quantum mechanics. Among the achievements of quantum field theory is that it can explain this mystery.\nWhat does it mean? Questions such as what a wave function \"really is\" and what is meant by \"making a measurement\" were intensely debated in the early years. By 1930, however, a more or less standard interpretation of quantum mechanics had been developed by Bohr and his colleagues, the so-called Copenhagen Interpretation . The key elements are the probabilistic description of matter and events, and reconciliation of the wavelike and particle-like natures of things through Bohr's principle of complementarity. Einstein never accepted quantum theory; he and Bohr debated its principles until Einstein's death in 1955.\nA central issue in the debates on quantum mechanics was whether the wave function contains all possible information about a system, or if there might be underlying factors\u0097hidden variables\u0097that determine the outcome of a particular measurement. In the mid-1960s John S. Bell showed that if hidden variables existed, experimentally observed probabilities would have to fall below certain limits, dubbed \"Bell's inequalities.\" Experiments were carried out by a number of groups, which found that the inequalities were violated. Their collective data came down decisively against the possibility of hidden variables. For most scientists, this resolved any doubt about the validity of quantum mechanics.\nNevertheless, the nature of quantum theory continues to attract attention because of the fascination with what is sometimes described as \"quantum weirdness.\" The weird properties of quantum systems arise from what is known as entanglement. Briefly, a quantum system, such as an atom, can exist in any one of a number of stationary states but also in a superposition\u0097or sum\u0097of such states. If one measures some property such as the energy of an atom in a superposition state, in general the result is sometimes one value, sometimes another. So far, nothing is weird.\nIt is also possible, however, to construct a two-atom system in an entangled state in which the properties of both atoms are shared with each other. If the atoms are separated, information about one is shared, or entangled, in the state of the other. The behavior is unexplainable except in the language of quantum mechanics. The effects are so surprising that they are the focus of study by a small but active theoretical and experimental community. The issues are not limited to questions of principle, as entanglement can be useful. Entangled states have already been employed in quantum communication systems, and entanglement underlies all proposals for quantum computation.\nThe Second Revolution\nDuring the frenetic years in the mid-1920s when quantum mechanics was being invented, another revolution was under way. The foundations were being laid for the second branch of quantum physics\u0097quantum field theory. Unlike quantum mechanics, which was created in a short flurry of activity and emerged essentially complete, quantum field theory has a tortuous history that continues today. In spite of the difficulties, the predictions of quantum field theory are the most precise in all of physics, and quantum field theory constitutes a paradigm for some of the most crucial areas of theoretical inquiry.\nThe problem that motivated quantum field theory was the question of how an atom radiates light as its electrons \"jump\" from excited states to the ground state. Einstein proposed such a process, called spontaneous emission, in 1916, but he had no way to calculate its rate. Solving the problem required developing a fully relativistic quantum theory of electromagnetic fields; a quantum theory of light. Quantum mechanics is the theory of matter. Quantum field theory, as its name suggests, is the theory of fields, not only electromagnetic fields but other fields that were subsequently discovered.\nIn 1925 Born, Heisenberg, and Jordan published some initial ideas for a theory of light, but the seminal steps were taken by Dirac\u0097a young and essentially unknown physicist working in isolation\u0097who presented his field theory in 1926. The theory was full of pitfalls: formidable calculational complexity, predictions of infinite quantities, and apparent violations of the correspondence principle.\nIn the late 1940s a new approach to the quantum theory of fields, QED (for quantum electrodynamics), was developed by Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. They sidestepped the infinities by a procedure, called renormalization, which essentially subtracts infinite quantities so as to leave finite results. Because there is no exact solution to the complicated equations of the theory, an approximate answer is presented as a series of terms that become more and more difficult to calculate. Although the terms become successively smaller, at some point they should start to grow, indicating the breakdown of the approximation. In spite of these perils, QED ranks among the most brilliant successes in the history of physics. Its prediction of the interaction strength between an electron and a magnetic field has been experimentally confirmed to a precision of two parts in 1,000,000,000,000.\nNotwithstanding its fantastic successes, QED harbors enigmas. The view of empty space\u0097the vacuum\u0097that the theory provides initially seems preposterous. It turns out that empty space is not really empty. Rather, it is filled with small, fluctuating electromagnetic fields. These vacuum fluctuations are essential for explaining spontaneous emission. Furthermore, they produce small but measurable shifts in the energies of atoms and certain properties of particles such as the electron. Strange as they seem, these effects have been confirmed by some of the most precise experiments ever carried out.\nAt the low energies of the world around us, quantum mechanics is fantastically accurate. But at high energies where relativistic effects come into play, a more general approach is needed. Quantum field theory was invented to reconcile quantum mechanics with special relativity. The towering role that quantum field theory plays in physics arises from the answers it provides to some of the most profound questions about the nature of matter. Quantum field theory explains why there are two fundamental classes of particles\u0097fermions and bosons\u0097and how their properties are related to their intrinsic spin. It describes how particles\u0097not only photons, but electrons and positrons (antielectrons)\u0097are created and annihilated. It explains the mysterious nature of identity in quantum mechanics\u0097how identical particles are absolutely identical because they are created by the same underlying field. QED describes not only the electron but the class of particles called leptons that includes the muon, the tau meson, and their antiparticles.\nBecause QED is a theory for leptons, however, it cannot describe more complex particles called hadrons. These include protons, neutrons, and a wealth of mesons. For hadrons, a new theory had to be invented, a generalization of QED called quantum chromodynamics, or QCD . Analogies abound between QED and QCD. Electrons are the constituents of atoms; quarks are the constituents of hadrons. In QED the force between charged particles is mediated by the photon; in QCD the force between quarks is mediated by the gluon. In spite of the parallels, there is a crucial difference between QED and QCD. Unlike leptons and photons, quarks and gluons are forever confined within the hadron. They cannot be liberated and studied in isolation.\nQED and QCD are the cornerstones for a grand synthesis known as the Standard Model. The Standard Model has successfully accounted for every particle experiment carried out to date. However, for many physicists the Standard Model is inadequate, because data on the masses, charges, and other properties of the fundamental particles need to be found from experiments. An ideal theory would predict all of these.\nToday, the quest to understand the ultimate nature of matter is the focus of an intense scientific study that is reminiscent of the frenzied and miraculous days in which quantum mechanics was created, and whose outcome may be even more far-reaching. The effort is inextricably bound to the quest for a quantum description of gravity. The procedure for quantizing the electromagnetic field that worked so brilliantly in QED has failed to work for gravity, in spite of a half-century of effort. The problem is critical, for if general relativity and quantum mechanics are both correct, then they must ultimately provide a consistent description for the same events. There is no contradiction in the normal world around us, because gravity is so fantastically weak compared to the electrical forces in atoms that quantum effects are negligible and a classical description works beautifully. But for a system such as a black hole where gravity is incredibly strong, we have no reliable way to predict quantum behavior.\nOne century ago our understanding of the physical world was empirical. Quantum physics gave us a theory of matter and fields, and that knowledge transformed our world. Looking to the next century, quantum mechanics will continue to provide fundamental concepts and essential tools for all the sciences. We can make such a prediction confidently because for the world around us quantum physics provides an exact and complete theory. However, physics today has this in common with physics in 1900: It remains ultimately empirical\u0097we cannot fully predict the properties of the elementary constituents of matter, we must measure them.\nPerhaps string theory \u0097a generalization of quantum field theory that eliminates all infinities by replacing point-like objects such as the electron with extended objects\u0097or some theory only now being conceived, will solve the riddle. Whatever the outcome, the dream of ultimate understanding will continue to be a driving force for new knowledge, as it has been since the dawn of science. One century from now, the consequences of pursuing that dream will belie our imagination.\nDaniel Kleppner is Lester Wolf Professor of Physics and Acting Director of the Research Laboratory of Electronics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

While both have led to a deeper understanding of our world, quantum physics stands alone in its profound weirdness \u2013 the ability to accurately predict totally counter-intuitive aspects of the physical world. From the simple indisputable oddity of the double slit experiment to the philosophical implications of Schrodinger\u2019s cat , it becomes clear that we still understand very little of the actual mechanics of our world.\nWhen explanations are lacking, the mystical is often brought up to fill the void. This has degenerated today into complete pop-psychology crap such as The Secret or What the Bleep Do We Know, but the role that human consciousness plays as an \u201cobserver\u201d, if any, was considered very early by the founders of these theories. These arguments brought forth by some of the finest thinkers of our time echo to this day.\nNiels Bohr\nWinner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922, employed by the Manhattan Project, and father of the Bohr model familiar to every high school student, Niels Bohr was first accused by Einstein of introducing \u201cmystic\u201d elements in his explanation of quantum physics \u2013 mystic elements which in Einstein\u2019s view had no place in science.\nThis was part of the famous Bohr-Einstein debates , and was perhaps not a fair criticism. Bohr appeared to not worry excessively about the \u201creality\u201d underpinning the equations of quantum theory, and was simply more concerned about the equations of quantum theory rather than their implications. He rejected the hypothesis that the wave function collapse requires a conscious observer, insisting that \u201cIt still makes no difference whether the observer is a man, an animal, or a piece of apparatus\u201d.\nHis view is perhaps best summarized in the following quote recalled by Heisenberg:\nThis argument looks highly convincing at first sight. We can admittedly find nothing in physics or chemistry that has even a remote bearing on consciousness. Yet all of us know that there is such a thing as consciousness, simply because we have it ourselves. Hence consciousness must be part of nature, or, more generally, of reality, which means that, quite apart from the laws of physics and chemistry, as laid down in quantum theory, we must also consider laws of quite a different kind. But even here I do not really know whether we need greater freedom than we already enjoy thanks to the concept of complementarity.\nIn short, if the numbers work out, don\u2019t worry too much.\nWolfgang Pauli\nBut some did worry. Pauli was a skeptic\u2019s skeptic \u2013 a man so dedicated to rationality it led him down a strange path. In 1927 the Solvay Conference was busy reaching consensus that Bohr\u2019s approach was the best way to regard quantum physics (the Cophenhagen Interpretation), but Pauli was equally confident in a different interpretation. He tried to trace out just what part of consciousness it is that seems to prevent an in-depth, rational understanding. Deeply influenced by Schopenhauer\u2019s The World as Will and Representation , Pauli appropriated his concept of a will \u201cwhich breaks through space and time\u201d.\nHe viewed that the acquisition of knowledge in mathematics or quantum physics \u201cgives rise, however, to a situation transcending natural science\u201d that can even acquire a \u201creligious function\u201d in human experience. This is not a belief in the religions of old, but as Pauli states \u201cI do not believe in the possible future of mysticism in the old form. However, I do believe that the natural sciences will out of themselves bring forth a counter pole in their adherents, which connects to the old mystic elements.\u201d\nPerhaps the most interesting viewpoint on Pauli was that of Heisenberg, who viewed Pauli\u2019s paradigm as even more rational than Bohr\u2019s equation-focused approach because only he acknowledged that the scientific evidence pointed to something pre-rational or \u2018mystical\u2019. Pauli claimed that consciousness was presented philosophically by mystics and studied scientifically by psychologists. With the advent of quantum mechanics, physicists should then be able to unify both approaches. Unfortunately, we continue to wait.\nAlbert Einstein\nEinstein was a scientific superstar, with fame not equalled to this day. One day, a quote was making the round in British newspapers that Einstein subscribed to the theory that \u201cthe outer world is a derivative of consciousness\u201d. His response was swift and critical.\nNo physicist believes that. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be a physicist. Neither do [Eddington and Jeans]. . . . These men are genuine scientists and their literary formulations must not be taken as expressive of their scientific convictions. Why should anybody go to the trouble of gazing at the stars if he did not believe that the stars were really there?\nEinstein\u2019s opposition to Bohr\u2019s view or more \u201cmystical\u201d approaches is often cast as the great divide between the philisophies of idealism and those philosophies based on realism. Pauli often referred to Einstein\u2019s \u201cphilosophical prejudice\u201d assuming that reality is independent of any mind. In fact, his approach and objections were far more subtle. His major concern was the incredibly subjective aspect of consciousness introducing an unmeasurable \u201cgeist\u201d, and this clash with the precise and well defined philosophical principles of physics such as locality or determinism.\nThis led to Einstein\u2019s famous attempt at \u201cbreaking\u201d quantum physics, the EPR paradox . At first a thought experiment which appeared to demonstrate quantum physics violating the seemingly well established principle of locality , later experiments showed that quantum physics instead proved locality false.\nViolations of locality and determinism seemed to bother Einstein greatly, and this can be seen in his famous quote objecting to the randomness involved in wave function collapse under Bohr\u2019s interpretation, that \u201cGod does not play dice\u201d.\nBohr, summing up the debate perfectly, replied \u201cEinstein, stop telling God what to do with his dice.\u201d\nJohn von Neumann\nThe \u201clast of the great mathematicians\u201d, von Neumann solved one of the great problems of quantum theory. While the theory itself was established and experimentally verified, it lacked a \u201cdeep\u201d mathematical understanding based on an axiomatic approach. He treated the world as a Hilbert space , an infinite dimensional structure.\nWhile classical mechanics approached the world as a collection of points with six different characteristics (position and momentum along the x, y, and z axis), von Neumann\u2019s approach considers a quantum system as a point in infinite dimensional space, corresponding to the infinite amount of possible outcomes. This led to very interesting implications in terms of \u201cmeasurement\u201d. While the \u201cmeasurement\u201d of a classical system simply involved finding one or more of those six values, the \u201cmeasurement\u201d of a quantum system involved mathematical operators acting on an infinite amount of values to produce a finite measurement.\nThe interesting conclusion arises when we consider the \u201creal\u201d interpretation of these mathematical operators. While we may say that an scientific instrument has caused wave function collapse, we run into the problem that no physical system (and a scientific instrument is a physical system completely described by quantum mechanics) can cause wave function collapse. We can describe the entire ensemble perfectly as a Hilbert space. But we do not experience this Hilbert space \u2013 we measure and experience only finite values.\nThe conclusion von Neumann reached is that consciousness, whatever it is, appears to be the only thing in physics that can ultimately cause this collapse or observation. This does not mean that consciousness is \u201crequired\u201d for the universe to work, but that wave function collapse appears to be caused by consciousness and we observe only a tiny slice. We are therefore an \u201cabstract ego\u201d acting as a measurement device on the infinite values of true reality.\nToday\nToday, the argument has largely died down, a combination of practicality and lack of any suitably shocking experimental results. The majority of physicists today take the approach of \u201cit works\u201d, namely that quantum physics produces accurate predictions of the real world and that the mathematical formalism is just that \u2013 a mathematical formalism that produces accurate results.\nIt may not reflect the true reality of the world (whatever it is), but it is suitably accurate to any level of precision that we are physically able to obtain. One may stay awake at night wondering \u201cwhy\u201d, but one will not get much work done with this approach. Perhaps more clarity lies in the future, but in the meantime \u2013 we will have to tolerate crap that tells us we can \u201cwill\u201d our way to riches with quantum mechanics (and coincidentally make the authors rather rich, will indeed) instead of a rational approach dedicated to the pursuit of truth.\n"}, {"score": 2329.9043, "uuid": "c53f8d26-1a77-5f85-a68f-af2adcdfbb17", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0809wb-10-16226", "target_hostname": "linas.org", "target_uri": "http://linas.org/theory/quantum.html", "page_rank": 1.3875898e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>The</em> Origin of Time, <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>, <em>and</em> Free Will", "snippet": "<em>The</em> Origin of Time, <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>, <em>and</em> Free Will Abstract: A metaphysical exploration of <em>the</em> origin <em>and</em> nature of Time, <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em> <em>and</em> other issues.", "explanation": null, "document": "The Origin of Time, Quantum Mechanics, and Free Will\nAbstract: A metaphysical exploration of the origin and nature of Time, Quantum Mechanics and other issues. The goal of this exploration is to provide some alternative viewpoints to many of the popular interpretations and dogmatic beliefs that surround these topics, such as the notion of the Quantum Multiverse, or the interplay between pre-determination and free-choice. The hypothetical scenarios described herein attempt to be anchored in principles from basic physics, dressed up with hand-waving and imagination. One particular (heretical) hypothesis is advocated: Quantum mechanics (and time itself) is a side-effect, an outcome of physics at Planck scales, rather than inherent in it.\nThis is not a religious tract, nor is it physics, nor is it philosophy. It is meant to be no less and no more than a rational discourse on some of conundrums at the outer limits of our known physical understanding today. Since its arguably B.S.; lets just call it metaphysics and be over with it. The intent is, however, serious. The exploration here is meant to be part of a puzzle piece, along with a parallel exploration of freewill and the existence of Platonic realms, and a critique of Heidegger . Some of this might be experimentally tested? And maybe we can even associate some mathematical equations with these ideas, giving them at least a little bit of traction.\nPre-Determination - NOT!\nSir Isaac Newton presented (ref?) the philosophical concept that all events in the universe are pre-determined or pre-destined. This concept is anchored in the Newtonian idea that the motions of bodies are given by differential equations, and that differential equations can be solved, and that therefore the future can not only be known and predicted, but is in fact inevitable and inescapable. As long as motion is governed by fixed, immutable equations, so then is our life on earth pre-destined, and we run through our lives as cogs and gears in a mechanical clockwork, inevitably doing what these equations of motion force us to do. We have no free will, and the past, present, and future is just an apparition. (See the Gestalt of Determinism )\nBunk. Of course this isn't right, and with the exception of a few brave individuals, (e.g. Julian Barbour ) nobody but nobody actually believes that this is the case. We have a too-strong anthropocentric experience to accept this view: we all know what the past is, we all sense that we live in the present, and we all seem to agree that much of the future, or at least, the truly important parts, are unpredictable. Curiously though, in this popular view, it is never pointed out that in fact, the past fits the above description to a tee. The past is so perfectly \"predictable\" that, in fact, we don't even use that word: we \"remember\" the past, we don't \"predict\" it. The past is immutable and unchangeable: there is nothing that we can do to change the past. That is, the past is exactly like those immutable, unalterable equations of motion: predestined and inescapable. So it seems that the past is exactly like this Newtonian world-view: its just that something funny happens in the present, somehow making the future unknowable.\nOne might think of the past as a block of ice forming, as the liquid present freezes onto it. The present, the 'here and now', is like a wave of crystallization, like Kurt Vonegut's Ice-9, freezing, propagating through space-time, segregating what was from what might be. This might make for nice literary allusions, but doesn't fit with the Newtonian view. Differential equations know of no past, present, or future: they don't distinguish between these, and this is precisely where the metaphysical problem originates. Ordinary, 'classical' mechanics states that the future is just like the past, and this seems to be inescapable, even as we all know intuitively that this is not so.\nTwo modern developments in Physics seem to offer avenues of escape from the conundrum of pre-determination. The first, Quantum Mechanics, introduces a certain amount of randomness that provides the wiggle-room needed to make the future unpredictable, and offer at least a glimmer for free will. Unfortunately, Quantum is saddled with a number of messy interpretational problems that leave an unsatisfying taste in the mouths of anyone who cares to seriously try them. The second, Chaos Theory, doesn't offer immediate escape from classical dynamics, but does show us how a whole lot of unpredictable things can happen in a short amount of time.\nQuantum Multiverse - NOT!\nThe most popular interpretation of quantum mechanics these days is the Quantum Multiverse. A popularized version of the Many-Worlds Hypothesis, it asserts that there are zillions of parallel universes being created every instant, through acts of quantum measurement. According to the popular press, this is the hypothesis that real physicists like the best.\nThe need for such an interpretation is due to some curious puzzles that arise in discussions of quantum measurement. We review some of these below, and after that, we dive in.\nQuantum Measurement\nLets review some popular quantum conundrums:\nSchreodinger's Cat Paradox\nMott, Heisenberg, 1929: alpha particles with spherical wave functions leave straight tracks in cloud chambers (alternately, consider a detector consisting of several plates at various distances and covering a 4pi solid angle. The non-detection of a decay at a closer plate has caused the wave function to 'collapse' at least partly, avoiding that plate, and eventually being detected on a more distant plate. Clearly, the language used to describe this makes 'wave function collapse' sound even more disconcerting than it is. The Mott/Heisenberg straight-track observation is a special case of this, where the wave function collapse has occurred on some microscopic scale, by ionizing an atom, as opposed to being delayed for macroscopic time periods.)\nEPR; and specifically, the decay of a singlet to a pair of spin-1/2 particles. Bell's Theorm.\nQuantum interference over macroscopic scales: e.g. proton interferometer\nClauser Horne Shimoney etal\nLets review the popularly discussed quantum measurement proposals. All of these proposals seem to be lacking in that none provide any sort of detailed description of the mechanics of wave function collapse. They attempt to resolve the meta-physical paradoxes without proposing the physics.\nMany Worlds, aka 'Quantum Multiverse'. The 'universe splits in two' every time a measurement is made. Since measurements apparently happen all the time, there's a googleplex of parallel universes. Without a more detailed proposal as to what the process is, and what sort of experimental predication it can make, its just more metaphysics. Popular among freer thinkers.\nThe 'brain/mind' causes quantum measurements to occur. This is one extreme response to the Schroedinger Cat Paradox: The wave function doesn't collapse until the experimenter looks the instruments. I don't think any mainstream thinkers take this seriously. There are too many ways to poke holes into this.\nMany-body/Thermodynamic Interaction Hypothesis. This is probably what most mainstream physicists think is the 'correct' answer, mostly because they haven't really thought about it. The wave function collapse occurs when the wave function interacts with a many-body, chaotic, thermodynamic system. Indeed, there is a huge grain of fact to this: wave functions really don't collapse until they interact with a whole bunch of atoms. There's a multitude of ways of supporting this position through experimental and theoretical arguments. Unfortunately, it has an Achilles heel: it fails to actually resolve any paradoxes. For example, consider the following: a spin-0 singlet state that decays into two very energetic spin-1/2 particles. We've arranged the fast decay products to pass through space-like separated stern-Gerlach magnets before hitting cloud chambers at each end. Think about it: you'll see why the mantra of 'thermodynamic interaction' won't work. (The singlet decays into a pair of EPR correlated particles; we know their spins point in opposite directions (yada yada Bell's Theorm yada yada). As they pass through the Stern-Gerlach magnets, the trajectories are deflected up or down. Then, finally, the 'measurement': the interaction between many bodies in the cloud chamber that collapses the wave packets. To maintain correlation between the measurements, the final collapse can't just happen when the wave function interacts with the gas in the cloud chamber. What happens in one cloud chamber is intimately connected to what happened in the other. Measurements seem to violate locality.)\nThere are various ways of dressing up this hypothesis in high-falutin' language. For example: during interactions with multiple bodies, certain paths that may have at one point contributed to the Feynmann path integral in fact bump into analytic 'cuts', and stop contributing in a phase-coherent fashion to the path integral, thereby causing a collapse of the wave function. These cuts in the analytic plane don't exist in two-body interactions, but absolutely litter the phase space when the N in N-body is large enough. In other words, for N sufficiently larger than two, most phases follow chaotic paths, and the phase relationships are no longer coherent, but become incoherent, thereby marking the wave function collapse. (For example, consider the chaotic regime of the forced harmonic oscillator). This view of wave function collapse seems at first to be very appealing, precisely because it can be dressed up with all sorts of flowery appeals to chaos and the like. But, as we mentioned, it founders because it is ultimately a local theory, and fails to explain EPR correlations.\nNegative-energy influences travel backwards in time, thereby 'correcting' the initial state. This hypothesis states that when a measurement occurs, some influence travels backwards in time, and modifies what happened 'back then', to bring it into a state consistent with the measurement. There's a certain amount of beauty to this hand-waving argument. Time symmetry makes anti-particles look like particles traveling backwards in time, and all solutions to the Dirac equation (with a non-zero momentum) have a negative energy component. This hypothesis, when coupled to the 'thermodynamic' hypothesis, actually seems capable of resolving the EPR correlation issues. The measurements work out because some influence travels backwards in time, alters the original state, and sets things aright. To put it another way: we know that when we make predictions about future experiments with Bell's theorem, we know that the wave must be in this and that state. We know that when we analyze experiments performed in the past, they are consistent with Bell's theorem. The one thing we can't verify is that the experiments aren't somehow \"rearranging\" themselves in the \"past\", with unexpected wave-function \"collapses\" that harmonize the results. Unfortunately, this hypothesis seems to get almost no serious discussion, and is therefore quite vague as to specific mechanisms and details.\nLooking for Cracks in Quantum Theory\nWhere might we search for chinks in the armor? QED and the second quantization underlying it is the most accurate physical theory known to man. How might it be wrong? The symmetries underlying it (and the more stunning symmetries in the Standard Model and QCD) are quite beautiful. They're experimentally unarguable, so we take them as truth. The other major ingredient to this theory is second quantization. For every point in space-time, second quantization states that we must take an integral over all field values. The algebra of second quantization is a marvelous tool for working between Lagrangians/Actions and propagators/vertices. This algebra is vital for tying QED calculations into a coherent conceptual whole. However, the experimental evidence for second quantization is much slimmer. We know that we need to sum over many states, otherwise, it wouldn't be quantum-mechanical. For the algebra to work cleanly and nicely, its easiest to sum over all states. When presented in textbooks, the integration is always done as if each point in space-time was independent, and scant attention is paid to the measure. For example, it is claimed that discontinuous Feynmann paths can't contribute to the path integral, because the action would be infinite, thus damping out the exponential. Whether the measure of the discontinuous paths mightn't also be large isn't considered. This kind of a hand-waving argument completely ignores a variety of known mathematical monstrosities, such as the Farey number mapping, which is a smooth, monotonically increasing function whose derivatives are zero at all rational numbers! Yuck! After examining a few of these monsters, the hand-waving about the contribution of paths to second quantization becomes weak.\nWe could attack the path integral from a second direction. For example, in thermodynamic problems, one averages over an avogadro's number of states, which, for all practical purposes, we can take as 'infinite'. This is because experimental evidence provides close support for the taking of thermodynamic averages. We also know that thermodynamics breaks down when dealing with dozens or hundreds of atoms, because by then, the averages no longer accurately approximate the situation. Unfortunately, we have few similar experimental explorations on the contributions of the path integral to second quantization. We know that it must be correct for the most part, because otherwise quantum mechanics in general wouldn't work. The Casimir effect, studies of dielectrics, and surface tension physics provide some experimental tests of second quantization, but the linkage is not precise. (In the Casimir effect, one sums over all standing waves trapped between a pair of metal plates. Or, at least, one sums up to a frequency at which the plates become transparent to EM waves. This summation is a kind of a path integral. The experiments work, and the summation is quite sensitive to the cutoff frequency/regulator. In certain geometries, the summations lead to infinities that need to be regulated or dealt with, much like the free-field QED theory. What's different is that in the Casimir effect or in surface-tension or dielectric calculations, the infinities are 'real' in the sense that they really do depend on the cutoff frequency, and different materials with different cutoffs can be measured in the lab. But there is still a big leap from these experiments to the path integral.\nPlanck Scale Spacetime Foams\nOK, now we leap off the deep end. We can't attack super-string theories and the like because their geometrical principles are quite beautiful, quite believable, and rather unassailable. For example, if the first GUT doesn't work, there's always another, and if you can pull a fine-tuning trick from up your d-brane'd sleeve, that's better. So instead, we mount the attack based on the a naive, geometrical interpretation of the Feynmann path integral and the process of second quantization. Lets just dive in.\nAbstract: By assuming that Planck-scale spacetime resembles a 'foam', it is deduced, by means of hand-waving, that most quantum phenomena are best understood as interactions classical geodesics on this foam. Furthermore, it is argued that the arrow of time, as something distinct from 3D space, and having a fixed past and unknowable future, is a side-effect of the reconciliation of anomalies in this foam.\nLets assume that spacetime, at Planck scales (10e-40), resembles a foam of worm-holes. Lets imagine geodesics on this foam. Now, lets imagine that these geodesics interacted like billiard balls, i.e. had point interactions with each other. This clearly leads to grandfather paradoxes throughout the foam: a future billiard ball could emerge from a wormhole in the past, and prevent itself from going into the very wormhole it emerged from.\nHypothesis: The space-time foam tries to organize or equilibrate itself so that such grandfather-paradoxes between billiard geodesics do not occur. Hypothesis: this act of organizing or equilibrating propagates through the foam as a 'wavefront', a 3D slab of a surface traveling along a fourth dimension. This thin 3D slab is what we call 'right now'; what lies behind this slab is 'the past', and what lies ahead is 'the future'.\nNow let us pause to notice that this simple model does a decent job of 'explaining' second quantization. How does it do this?\nFirst, note that the act of second quantization consists of writing a sum, a 'Feynmann Path Integral' over all possible paths, weighted by the exponent of the action. The action defines the classical path; as any given path deviates from the classical path, it is weighted away. With only the slightest of handwaving, it should be obvious that if we imagine geodesics on a space-time foam, that these could well be taken to be the 'paths' that contribute to the path integral. Now, a purist might start arguing about the Hausdorff Measure of geodesics on a foam, as compared to the 'uniformly distributed' Jacobian of a path integral, but I will only shoot back that any such argument is already on tenuous mathematical footing. The set of geodesics on a foam should probably form a complete enough set to work just fine as the domain over which a path integral is taken. (Although not usually studied by physicists, there are deep fundamental problems with integrals of stochastic differential equations, which are well know to 'quants' working in the financial industries. These difficulties have been overcome for simple arbitrage and options pricing formulas but continue to plague more complex financial models. With some handwaving, its clear that many of these problems apply to path integrals as well, especially when one considers the question of whether the 'paths' contributing to the integral are differentiable or even continuous.)\nNext, note that the 'accidental' resemblance of various diffusion and stat-mech equations to various quantum equations is no longer so 'accidental': the statistical properties and distributions of geodesics on a foam should indeed have the same qualitative properties as Brownian motion in a hard-ball gas.\nThus, we've just hand-waved our way over a giant part of quantum mechanics. To be more precise, we will need to also cover why it is that Planck's constant is used in these path integrals, and how nothing in this handwaving contradicts the infinitely more rigorous theories of superstrings. Indeed, while we're handwaving, we should point out that talking of geodesics on a spacetime foam might be a lot like talking about the hydrogen atom is if it were a planetary system whose orbits are constrained to have integer-wavelength circumference. We know that Bohr Action-Angle formalisms gave over to solutions of the Schroedinger wave equation for the Hydrogen atom; in a similar way, we might think that this talk of geodesics is a mental place-holder for something that ultimately phrases itself quite differently.\nMethods of Attack\nHow can we make headway through this mess? A space-time foam of wormholes is tough. It seems almost blindingly difficult to proceed with a mathematical analysis. Yet we try anyway on another web page .\nQuantum Measurement\nNote that the probabilities of quantum wave functions are re-interpreted as the possible future geometrical arrangements of the Planck-scale foam. Some arrangements are very likely, some are very unlikely. There are no hidden variables here: all one can talk about is possible future arrangements based on a knowledge of the current/past history. (Question to be answered: if the past is not known, who does this affect the prediction? i.e. how would we envision a (non-relativistic) electron propagating in free space? What is happening to this 'wave' as this Planck-scale foam 'freezes' along? Generically, how does one derive the idea of a propagater from the foam? There are similarities to diffusion eqn, but how can one get more specific?)\nNext, let us imagine what this world of geodesics implies for quantum measurement. There is a strong sense of non-locality that is induced by this foam. Imagine the classic spin-EPR experiment, where a singlet decays into a pair of spin-1/2 particles, whose spins are then measured, and found to be correlated. This is where, I think, my handwaving reaches a crux, and all the best stuff falls out. Here goes (this is a bit rocky):\nImagine that the spin-1/2 state is described by a collection of geodesics propagating on this foam. As this data propagates through the foam, a pair of measurements are made, and the data from these measurements are brought back together to roughly the same point in spacetime, where the experimenter can compare them and verify that e.g. Bell's theorem, has not been violated. Hypothesis: the geodesics in the space-time foam can only be made self-consistent in the backwards light cone. In particular, the geodesics from one measurement cannot be reconciled with those from the other until that have both entered into a common backwards light cone (i.e. the measurements have been brought together). When these paths are brought back together, the outcome 'freezes', i.e. become a part of the 'past'. This act of coming together defines not only the arrow of time, but defines time itself (or rather, distinguishes time from space).\nThe Past is Manifest Destiny. (Newtonian ...) The claim is that this is no accident. The creation of the past is what happens when geodesics are reconciled on a space-time foam.\nCosmological Inflation\nNote that inflation (a la big-bang inflation) seems to add an important ingredient to the above scenario. Without inflation, the wave of ice-9 freezing would have engulfed the entire universe in short order. With inflation, large space-like separations are introduced between all parts of the universe, thus requiring far, far more 'passage of time' to patch those parts back together into the frozen past.\nDraft BS\nHand-waving for quantum numbers and 'elementary particles'. Quantum numbers find expression in being certain twisted configurations of geodesics. That is, elementary particles, such as the electron or neutrino, might just be topologically stable arrangements of the Planck-scale space-time foam: solitons of some sort. In other words, they might be analogous to the 'particles' seen in solid-state physics: bosonic 'phonons', or fermionic crystalline dislocations/defects. Particle masses would then presumably be functions of the number of handles, or some other topological integer. Anti-particles would presumably be some reversed topological knots that, when brought near a particle, can be slipped to untie the knots. I don't know enough of topology to argue that the Pauli exclusion principle may be topological in nature: some (anti-)symmetrical exchange of handles between two configurations.\nThe topological interpretation avoids the silly questions such as 'why do all electrons look alike'? They all look alike because they are all represented by the same set of self-consistent twists in the space-time foam. Asking 'why do all electrons look alike' is tantamount to asking 'why are all instances of the number two alike?' Or maybe better yet: 'why do all single-point dislocations of a lattice look alike?' Physical particles are configurations of an underlying relativistic 'ether'.\nThe above considerations would seem to dictate a program of topological research. However, this alone doesn't seem sufficient to resolve the issue of the arrow of time, or of the second law of thermodynamics. Topological arrangements would seem to be time-symmetric. Its too static in itself. If we are to view the past as 'fixed', and the future as 'indeterminate', then we need a language of topology where the past is fixed, the present is a mad scramble to arrange a topology so that it is consistent with everything that came in the past.\nI know of no topology that acts like this. There is no study that asks and answers the question: 'how do I tie the knot right here, so that the strands 'back there' don't have to be rearranged'. Topological stability in crystal lattice dislocations is independent of time, and are arrangements in 3D space. Instead, we need to ponder the evolution of topological entities as they are brought 'close' to each other in space.\nThe other problem is that we still have no insight into what free-will might be all about. Clearly, free-will is a phenomenon of the present: I have no free-will in the past, nor in the future. At best, I can try to control what I am doing 'right now'. Topological arguments seem to be deterministic, however fanciful they may get. It seems to me that any theory of the flow of time is somehow incomplete until it also somehow addresses the question of free-will.\nRe-emphasize that no matter how silly all of this sounds, it does indeed avoid both 'many-worlds' and the 'Schroedinger cat paradox' and all that baggage. No doubt, for some philosophers, 'many worlds' or quantum-indeterminate brain cells sound like more fun, but I think that my handwaving is less looney than the alternatives.\nThere are two ways of dealing with Clauser Horne Shimony etal correlations. One way is to view this as a bizarre kind of interferometric experiment, where macroscopic indeterminism exists until the results of both space-time measurements are brought to the same general area of space-time. i.e. the cat is both dead and alive until the experimenter brings both measurements together to discover that correlations exist. But this violates our macroscopic intuition about locality.\nAnother possibility is that upon wave function collapse in one location, an influence travels 'backwards in time', along one arm of the experiment, and thence forwards along the other, precipitating a change there. What is the form of this influence? Why, precisely that which can carry no information: a gauge-like rotation of the phase of the wave function. For space-like separated measurements, this communication via backwards-traveling geodesics helps keep each side in perfect correlation with the other, so that any interaction with a macroscopic, stochastic tank of particles that is the measuring instrument is 'simultaneously' echoed in the other arm.\nMight it be possible to test this hypothesis experimentally, by placing two devices at space-like separations, blasting correlated particles into both of them, and then looking to see if they've achieved thermodynamic equilibrium? For, if the hypothesis is correct, then faster-than-light signalling is disallowed, but thermodynamic interaction is not. This might be experimentally testable.\nHowever, this is tricky, and has a (fatal?) flaw: we can still do faster-than-light signalling. Lets say that experimenter at location A measures the temperature of a container that is getting getting correlated photons being shot into it. Experimenter at location B can put one of two containers in the path of the photons: a hot tank, and a cold tank. If quantum correlations could act to bring the two containers into thermodynamic equilibrium, then experimenter A would see the temperature rise, or drop, over time. With sufficient space-like separation, this could be used to perform faster-than-light signalling.\n(Equally disturbing is to think of the situation in terms of entropy.)\nPoint out some obvious similarities between closed geodesics and (super-) strings. Note that if the spacetime foam has to wiggle around to close up inconsistent (grandfather-paradoxish) geodesics, that this could well resemble vibrations of strings. Add the weasel words to state that we may not be talking about four dimensions here. Maybe add some super-symmetric handwaving.\nSay something about the future. How the future is sort-of predictable, in the sense that I can predict the path of a baseball, although I cannot predict that the baseball stadium will not be suddenly wiped out by a meteorite or other unexpected event. It is this essence: the merging of all events into the past light cone, that distinguishes the future from the past. Emphasize that quantum uncertainty is a sum over all states is really what this is all about: the uncertain future can only be expressed over all possible quantum states precisely because the precise arrangement of the spacetime foam won't be known until it becomes the past. Emphasize also the oxymoron: the arrangement of the past affects the future.\nExplore how things like chaos theory have implications for the predictability of the future, and in particular, how positive-Lyapunov exponent spacetime foams.\nExplore things like 'Hausdorff measure', Serpinski carpets, etc. are relevant to the conversation. Explore to see how classical chaos manifesting itself at the Planck scale may explain certain quantum phenomena. I dunno, this is pretty far out there.\nGlossary\nArrow of Time\nWe experience time to go forward, even though virtually all equations used in physics don't make a distinction between time moving forward, and time moving backwards. If the equations don't seem to care, then why does time move forward? This is the conundrum of the \"Arrow of Time\".\nButterfly Effect\nA popular term in chaos theory. Best understood through and old litany: For want of a nail the shoe was lost, for want of a shoe the horse was lost, for want of a horse the rider was lost, for want of a rider, the message was lost, for want of a message the battle was lost, all for want of a nail. It is a statement that small differences in initial conditions can lead to drastically different final outcomes. See also 'Positive Lyapunov Exponent'.\nEPR (Einstein Podolsky Rosen) Paradox\nA famous paper where a conundrum of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is explored ...\nFeynmann Path Integral\nWhen one places oneself outside the context of time ...\nGrandfather Paradox\nIf you had a time machine, could you go back and kill your own grandfather while he was just a child? And if you had, where would that leave you?

In particular, we can deduce that that the past is different than the future, because, well, that is just how we all experience time.\nInflation\n"}, {"score": 2329.2654, "uuid": "0523146d-380b-50fb-b0e1-6c4531e2da6c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1111wb-43-17909", "target_hostname": "www.cosmolearning.com", "target_uri": "http://www.cosmolearning.com/topics/1-quantum-gravity/", "page_rank": 1.2609342e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "<em>Quantum</em> Gravity | CosmoLearning <em>Physics</em>", "snippet": "Thus <em>the</em> philosopher&#x27;s task, if indeed she has one, <em>is</em> different from <em>what</em> it <em>is</em> when dealing with a more-or-less settled body of theory such as classical Newtonian <em>mechanics</em>, general relativity, or <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Topics: Quantum Mechanics - 1.

Introduction\nDutch artist M.C. Escher's elegant pictorial paradoxes are prized by many, not least by philosophers, physicists, and mathematicians. Some of his work, for example Ascending and Descending, relies on optical illusion to depict what is actually an impossible situation. Other works are paradoxical in the broad sense, but not impossible: Relativity depicts a coherent arrangement of objects, albeit an arrangement in which the force of gravity operates in an unfamiliar fashion. (See the Other Internet Resources section below for images.) Quantum gravity itself may be like this: an unfamiliar yet coherent arrangement of familiar elements. Or it may be like Ascending and Descending, an impossible construction which looks sensible in its local details but does not fit together into a coherent whole.\n\u2018Quantum gravity\u2019 primarily refers to an area of research, rather than a particular theory of quantum gravity. Several approaches exist, none of them entirely successful to date. Thus the philosopher's task, if indeed she has one, is different from what it is when dealing with a more-or-less settled body of theory such as classical Newtonian mechanics, general relativity, or quantum mechanics. In such cases, one typically proceeds by assuming the validity of the theory or theoretical framework and drawing the ontological and perhaps epistemological consequences of the theory, trying to understand what it is that the theory is telling us about the nature of space, time, matter, causation, and so on. Theories of quantum gravity, on the other hand, are bedeviled by a host of technical and conceptual problems, questions, and issues which make them unsuited to this approach. However, philosophers who have a taste for a broader and more open-ended form of inquiry will find much to think about.\n2. Gravity Meets Quantum Theory\nThe difficulties in reconciling quantum theory and gravity into some form of quantum gravity come from the prima facie incompatibility of general relativity, Einstein's relativistic theory of gravitation, with quantum field theory, the framework for the description of the other three forces (electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear interactions). Whence the incompatibility? General relativity is described by Einstein's equations, which amount to constraints on the curvature of spacetime (the Einstein tensor on the left-hand side) due to the presence of mass and other forms of energy, such as electromagnetic radiation (the stress-energy-momentum tensor on the right-hand side). (See John Baez's webpages in Other Internet Resources for an excellent introduction.) In doing so, they manage to encompass traditional, Newtonian gravitational phenomena such as the mutual attraction of two or more massive objects, while also predicting new phenomena such as the bending of light by these objects (which has been observed) and the existence of gravitational radiation (which has to date only been indirectly observed via the decrease in the period of binary pulsars). (For the latter observation, see the 1993 Physics Nobel Prize presentation speech by Carl Nordling .)\nIn general relativity, mass and energy are treated in a purely classical manner, where \u2018classical\u2019 means that physical quantities such as the strengths and directions of various fields and the positions and velocities of particles have definite values. These quantities are represented by tensor fields, sets of (real) numbers associated with each spacetime point. For example, the stress, energy, and momentum Tab(x,t) of the electromagnetic field at some point (x,t), are functions of the three components Ei, Ej, Ek, Bi, Bj, Bk of the electric and magnetic fields E and B at that point. These quantities in turn determine, via Einstein's equations, an aspect of the \u2018curvature\u2019 of spacetime, a set of numbers Gab(x,t) which is in turn a function of the spacetime metric. The metric gab(x,t) is a set of numbers associated with each point which gives the distance to neighboring points. At the end of the day, a model of the world according to general relativity consists of a spacetime manifold with a metric, the curvature of which is constrained by the stress-energy-momentum of the matter distribution. All physical quantities \u2014 the value of the x-component of the electric field at some point, the scalar curvature of spacetime at some point \u2014 have definite values, given by real (as opposed to complex or imaginary) numbers. Thus general relativity is a classical theory in the sense given above.\nThe problem is that our fundamental theories of matter and energy, the theories describing the interactions of various particles via the electromagnetic force and the strong and weak nuclear forces, are all quantum theories. In quantum theories, these physical quantities do not in general have definite values. For example, in quantum mechanics, the position of an electron may be specified with arbitrarily high accuracy only at the cost of a loss of specificity in the description of its momentum, hence its velocity. At the same time, in the quantum theory of the electromagnetic field known as quantum electrodynamics (QED), the electric and magnetic fields associated with the electron suffer an associated uncertainty. In general, physical quantities are described by a quantum state which gives a probability distribution over many different values, and increased specificity (narrowing of the distribution) of one property (e.g., position, electric field) gives rise to decreased specificity of its canonically conjugate property (e.g., momentum, magnetic field). This is an expression of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.\nOn the surface, the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum theory might seem rather trivial. Why not just follow the model of QED and quantize the gravitational field, similar to the way in which the electromagnetic field was quantized? Just as we associate a quantum state of the electromagnetic field with the quantum state of electrically charged matter, we should, one might think, similarly just associate a quantum state of the gravitational field with the quantum state of both charged and uncharged matter. This is more or less the path that has been taken, but it encounters extraordinary difficulties. Some physicists consider these to be technical difficulties, having to do with the non-renormalizability of the gravitational interaction and the consequent failure of the perturbative methods which have proven effective in ordinary quantum field theories. However, these technical problems are closely related to a set of daunting conceptual difficulties, of interest to both physicists and philosophers.\nThe conceptual difficulties basically follow from the nature of the gravitational interaction, in particular the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass, which allows one to represent gravity as a property of spacetime itself, rather than as a field propagating in a (passive) spacetime background. When one attempts to quantize gravity, one is subjecting some of the properties of spacetime to quantum fluctuations. But ordinary quantum theory presupposes a well-defined classical background against which to define these fluctuations (Weinstein, 2001a, b), and so one runs into trouble not only in giving a mathematical characterization of the quantization procedure (how to take into account these fluctuations in the effective spacetime structure?) but also in giving a conceptual and physical account of the theory that results, should one succeed. We will look in more detail at how these conceptual problems arise in two different research programs below. But first, we will talk a bit about some general methodological issues which haunt the field.\n3. Methodology\nResearch in quantum gravity has a rather peculiar flavor, owing to both the technical and conceptual difficulty of the field and the remoteness from experiment. Thus conventional notions of the relation between theory and experiment have a tenuous foothold, at best.\n3.1 Theory\nAs remarked in the introduction, there is no single, generally agreed-upon body of theory in quantum gravity. The majority of the physicists working in the field work on string theory, an ambitious program which aims at providing a unified theory of all interactions. A non-negligible minority work on what is now called loop quantum gravity, the goal of which is simply to provide a quantum theory of the gravitational interaction. There is also significant work in other areas. [Good recent reviews of the theoretical landscape include Carlip 2001 and Smolin 2001 (Other Internet Resources section below), 2003.] But there is no real consensus, for two reasons.\nThe first reason is that it is extremely difficult to make any concrete predictions in these theories. String theory, in particular, is plagued by a lack of predictions because of the tremendous number of distinct ground or vacuum states in the theory, with an absence of guiding principles for singling out the physically significant ones. Though the string community prides itself on the dearth of free parameters in the theory (in contrast to the nineteen or so free parameters found in the standard model of particle physics), the problem arguably resurfaces in the huge number of vacua associated with different compactifications of the nine space dimensions to the three we observe. Attempts to explain why we live in the particular vacuum that we do have recently given rise to appeals to the infamous anthropic principle (Susskind, 2003), whereby the existence of humans is invoked to, in some sense, \u201cexplain\u201d the fact that we find ourselves in a particular world.\nLoop quantum gravity is less plagued by a lack of predictions, and indeed it is often claimed that the discreteness of area and volume are concrete predictions of the theory. Proponents of this approach argue that this makes the theory more susceptible to falsification, thus more scientific (in the sense of Popper; see the entry on Karl Popper) than string theory. However, it is still quite unclear, in practice and even in principle, how one might actually observe these quantities.\n3.2 Experiment\nThe second reason for the absence of consensus is that there are no experiments in quantum gravity, and little in the way of observations that might qualify as direct or indirect data or evidence. This stems in part from the lack of theoretical predictions, since it is difficult to design an observational test of a theory if one does not know where to look or what to look at. But it also stems from the fact that most theories of quantum gravity appear to predict departures from classical relativity only at energy scales on the order of 1019 GeV. (By way of comparison, the proton-proton collisions at Fermilab have an energy on the order of 103 GeV.) Whereas research in particle physics proceeds in large part by examining the data collected in large particle accelerators, accelerators which are able to smash particles together at sufficiently high energies to probe the properties of atomic nuclei, gravity is so weak that there is no way to do a comparable experiment that would reveal properties at the energy scales at which quantum gravitational effects are expected to be important.\nThough progress is being made in trying to at least draw observational consequences of loop quantum gravity, a theory of quantum gravity which arguably does make predictions (Amelino-Camelia, 2003, in the Other Internet Resources section below; D. Mattingly, 2005), it is remarkable that the most notable \u201ctest\u201d of quantum theories of gravity imposed by the community to date involves a phenomenon which has never been observed, the so-called Hawking radiation from black holes. Based on earlier work of Bekenstein (1973) and others, Hawking (1974) predicted that black holes would radiate energy, and would do so in proportion to their gravitational \u201ctemperature,\u201d which was in turn understood to be proportional to their mass, angular momentum, and charge. Associated with this temperature is an entropy (see the entry on the philosophy of statistical mechanics), and one would expect a theory of quantum gravity to allow one to calculate the entropy associated with a black hole of given mass, angular momentum, and charge, the entropy corresponding to the number of quantum states of the gravitational field having the same mass, charge, and angular momentum. (See Unruh (2001) and references therein.)\nIn their own ways, string theory and loop quantum gravity have both passed the test of predicting an entropy for black holes which accords with Hawking's calculation. String theory gets the number right for a not-particularly physically realistic subset of black holes called near-extremal black holes, while loop quantum gravity gets it right for generic black holes, but only up to an overall constant. If the Hawking effect is real, then this consonance could be counted as evidence in favor of either or both theories.\nIt should be noted, finally, that to date neither of the main research programs has been shown to give rise to the world we see at low energies. Indeed, it is a major challenge of loop quantum gravity to show that it has general relativity as a low-energy limit, and a major challenge of string theory to show that it has the standard model of particle physics plus general relativity as a low-energy limit.\nThe absence of relevant experiments in quantum gravity is a peculiarity which has drawn little attention to date from philosophers of science (an exception is Butterfield & Isham, 2001). However, it would seem to be fertile ground for philosophical analysis, in that it raises the interesting question of how a science should and does proceed in the absence of data.\n4. Theoretical Frameworks\n4.1 String Theory\nKnown variously as string theory, superstring theory, and M-theory, this program has its roots, indirectly, in the observation, dating back to at least the 1950s, that classical general relativity looks in many ways like the theory of a massless \u2018spin-two\u2019 field propagating on the flat Minkowski spacetime of special relativity. [See Rovelli 2001b (Other Internet Resources section below), and 2006 for a capsule history, and Greene 2000 for a popular account.] This observation led to early attempts to formulate a quantum theory of gravity by \u201cquantizing\u201d this spin-two theory. However, it turned out that the theory is not perturbatively renormalizable, meaning that there are ineliminable infinities. Attempts to modify the classical theory to eliminate this problem led to a different problem, non-unitarity, and so this general approach was moribund until the mid-1970s, when it was discovered that a theory of one-dimensional \u201cstrings\u201d developed around 1970 to account for the strong interaction, actually provided a framework for a unified theory which included gravity, because one of the modes of oscillation of the string corresponded to a massless spin-two particle (the \u2018graviton\u2019).\nThe original and still prominent idea behind string theory was to replace the point particles of ordinary quantum field theory (particles like photons, electrons, etc) with one-dimensional extended objects called strings. (See Weingard, 2001 and Witten, 2001 for overviews of the conceptual framework.) In the early development of the theory, it was recognized that construction of a consistent quantum theory of strings required that the strings \u201clive\u201d in a larger number of spatial dimensions than the observed three; eventually, most string theories came to be formulated in nine space dimensions and one time dimension. Strings can be open or closed, and have a characteristic tension and hence vibrational spectrum. The various modes of vibration correspond to various particles, one of which is the graviton. The resulting theories have the advantage of being perturbatively renormalizable, at least to second order. This means that perturbative calculations are at least mathematically tractable. Since perturbation theory is an almost indispensable tool for physicists, this is deemed a good thing.\nString theory has undergone several mini-revolutions over the last several years, one of which involved the discovery of various duality relations, mathematical transformations connecting, in this case, what appeared to be mathematically distinct string theories \u2014 type I, type IIA, type IIB, HE and HO \u2014 to one another and to eleven-dimensional supergravity (a particle theory). The discovery of these connections led to the conjecture that all of the string theories are really aspects of a single underlying theory, which was given the name \u2018M-theory\u2019 (though M-theory is also used more specifically to describe the unknown theory of which eleven-dimensional supergravity is the low energy limit). The rationale is that what looks like one theory at strong coupling (high energy description) looks like another theory at weak coupling (lower energy, more tractable description), and that if all the theories are related to one another, then they must all be aspects of some more fundamental theory. Though attempts have been made, there has been no successful formulation of this theory: its very existence, much less its nature, is still largely a matter of conjecture.\n4.2 Canonical and Loop Quantum Gravity\nWhereas string theory views the curved spacetime of general relativity as an effective modification of a flat (or other fixed) background geometry by a massless spin-two field, the canonical quantum gravity program treats the spacetime metric itself as a kind of field, and attempts to quantize it directly.\nTechnically, most work in this camp proceeds by writing down general relativity in so-called \u2018canonical\u2019 or \u2018Hamiltonian\u2019 form, since there is a more-or-less clearcut way to quantize theories once they are put in this form (Kuchar, 1993; Belot & Earman, 2001). In a canonical description, one chooses a particular set of configuration variables xi and canonically conjugate momentum variables pi which describe the state of a system at some time. Then, one obtains the time-evolution of these variables from the Hamiltonian H(xi,pi). Quantization proceeds by treating the configuration and momentum variables as operators on a quantum state space (a Hilbert space) obeying certain commutation relations analogous to the classical Poisson-bracket relations, which effectively encode the quantum fuzziness associated with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.\nAlthough advocates of the canonical approach often accuse string theorists of relying too heavily on classical background spacetime, the canonical approach does something which is arguably quite similar, in that one begins with a theory that conceives time-evolution in terms of evolving some data given on a spacelike surface, and then quantizing the theory. The problem is that if spacetime is quantized, this assumption does not make sense in anything but an approximate way. This issue in particular is decidedly neglected in both the physical and philosophical literature (but see Isham (1993)), and there is more that might be said.\n4.2.1 Geometric variables\nEarly attempts at quantizing general relativity by Dirac, Wheeler, DeWitt and others in the 1950s and 1960s worked with a seemingly natural choice for configuration variables, namely geometric variables gij corresponding to the various components of the \u2018three-metric\u2019 describing the intrinsic geometry of the given spatial slice of spacetime. One can think about arriving at this via an arbitrary slicing of a 4-dimensional \u201cblock\u201d universe by 3-dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces. The conjugate momenta \u03c0ij then effectively encode the time rate-of-change of the metric, which, from the 4-dimensional perspective, is directly related to the extrinsic curvature of the slice (meaning the curvature relative to the spacetime in which the slice is embedded). This approach is known as \u2018geometrodynamics\u2019.\nIn these geometric variables, as in any other canonical formulation of general relativity, one is faced with constraints, which encode the fact that the canonical variables cannot be specified independently. A familiar example of a constraint is Gauss's law from ordinary electromagnetism, which states that, in the absence of charges, \u2207\u00b7E(x) = 0 at every point x. It means that the three components of the electric field at every point must be chosen so as to satisfy this constraint, which in turn means that there are only two \u201ctrue\u201d degrees of freedom possessed by the electric field at any given point in space. (Specifying two components of the electric field at every point dictates the third component.)\nThe constraints in electromagnetism may be viewed as stemming from the U(1) gauge invariance of Maxwell's theory, while the constraints of general relativity stem from the diffeomorphism invariance of the theory. Diffeomorphism invariance means, informally, that one can take a solution of Einstein's equations and drag it (meaning the metric and the matter fields) around on the spacetime manifold and obtain a mathematically distinct but physically equivalent solution. The three \u2018supermomentum\u2019 constraints in the canonical theory reflect the freedom to drag the metric and matter fields around in various directions on a given three-dimensional spacelike hypersurface, while the \u2018super-Hamiltonian\u2019 constraint reflects the freedom to drag the fields in the \u201ctime\u201d direction, and so to the \u201cnext\u201d hypersurface. (Each constraint applies at each point of the given spacelike hypersurface, so that there are actually 4 \u00d7 \u221e3 constraints, four for each point.) In the classical (unquantized) canonical formulation of general relativity, the constraints do not pose any particular conceptual problems. One effectively chooses a background space and time (via a choice of the lapse and shift functions) \u201con the fly\u201d, and one can be confident that the spacetime that results is independent of the particular choice. Effectively, different choices of these functions give rise to different choices of background against which to evolve the foreground. However, the constraints pose a serious problem when one moves to quantum theory.\n4.2.2 Problem of time\nAll approaches to canonical quantum gravity face the so-called \u201cproblem of time\u201d in one form or another (Kuchar (1992) and Isham (1993) are excellent reviews). The problem stems from the fact that in preserving the diffeomorphism-invariance of general relativity \u2014 depriving the coordinates of the background manifold of any physical meaning \u2014 the \u201cslices\u201d of spacetime one is considering inevitably include time, just as they include space. In the canonical formulation, the diffeomorphism invariance is reflected in the constraints, and the inclusion of what would ordinarily be a \u2018time\u2019 variable in the data is reflected in the existence of the super-Hamiltonian constraint. The difficulties presented by this constraint constitute the problem of time.\nAttempts to quantize general relativity in the canonical framework proceed by turning the canonical variables into operators on an appropriate state space (e.g., the space of square-integrable functions over three-metrics), and dealing somehow with the constraints. When quantizing a theory with constraints, there are two possible approaches. The approach usually adopted in gauge theories is to deal with the constraints before quantization, so that only true degrees of freedom are promoted to operators when passing to the quantum theory. There are a variety of ways of doing this so-called \u2018gauge fixing\u2019, but they all involve removing the extra degrees of freedom by imposing some special conditions. In general relativity, fixing a gauge is tantamount to specifying a particular coordinate system with respect to which the \u201cphysical\u201d data is described (spatial coordinates) and with respect to which it evolves (time coordinate). This is difficult already at the classical level, since the utility and, moreover, the very tractability of any particular gauge generally depends on the properties of the solution to the equations, which of course is what one is trying to find in the first place. But in the quantum theory, one is faced with the additional concern that the resulting theory may well not be independent of the choice of gauge. This is closely related to the problem of identifying true, gauge-invariant observables in the classical theory (Torre 2005, in the Other Internet Resources section).\nThe preferred approach in canonical quantum gravity is to impose the constraints after quantizing. In this \u2018constraint quantization\u2019 approach, due to Dirac, one treats the constraints themselves as operators A, and demands that \u201cphysical\u201d states \u03c8 be those which are solutions to the resulting equations A \u03c8 = 0. The problem of time is associated with the super-Hamiltonian constraint. The super-Hamiltonian H is responsible for describing time-evolution in the classical theory, yet its counterpart in the constraint-quantized theory, H \u03c8 = 0, would prima facie seem to indicate that the true physical states of the system do not evolve at all. Trying to understand how, and in what sense, the quantum theory describes the time-evolution of something, be it states or observables, is the essence of the problem of time.\n4.2.3 Ashtekar, loop, and other variables\nIn geometrodynamics, all of the constraint equations are difficult to solve (though the super-Hamiltonian constraint, known as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, is especially difficult), even in the absence of particular boundary conditions. Lacking solutions, one does not have a grip on what the true, physical states of the theory are, and one cannot hope to make much in the way of predictions. The difficulties associated with geometric variables are addressed by the program initiated by Ashtekar and developed by his collaborators (for a review and further references see Rovelli 2001b (Other Internet Resources), 2001a, 2004). Ashtekar used a different set of variables, a complexified \u2018connection\u2019 (rather than a three-metric) and its canonical conjugate, which made it simpler to solve the constraints. The program underwent further refinements with the introduction of the loop transform, and further refinements still when it was understood that equivalence classes of loops could be identified with spin networks. (See Smolin (2001, 2004) for a popular introduction.)\n4.3 Other Approaches\nThere are many other approaches to quantum gravity as well. Some (e.g., Huggett 2001, W\u00fcthrich 2004 (Other Internet Resources section); J. Mattingly 2005) have argued that semiclassical gravity, a theory in which matter is quantized but spacetime is classical, is a viable alternative. Other approaches include twistor theory (currently enjoying a revival in conjunction with string theory), Bohmian approaches (Goldstein & Teufel, 2001), causal sets (see Sorkin 2003, in the Other Internet Resources section) in which the universe is described as a set of discrete events along with a stipulation of their causal relations, and other discrete approaches (see Loll, 1998). Also of interest are arguments to the effect that gravity itself may play a role in quantum state reduction (Christian, 2001; Penrose, 2001).\n5. Philosophical Issues\nQuantum gravity raises a number of difficult philosophical questions. To date, it is the ontological aspects of quantum gravity that have attracted the most interest from philosophers, and it is these we will discuss in the first three sections below. In the final section, though, we will briefly discuss the methodological and epistemological issues which arise.\nFirst, however, let us discuss the extent to which ontological questions are tied to a particular theoretical framework. In its current stage of development, string theory unfortunately provides little indication of the more fundamental nature of space, time, and matter. Despite the consideration of ever more exotic objects \u2014 strings, p-branes, D-branes, etc. \u2014 these objects are still understood as propagating in a background spacetime. Since string theory is supposed to describe the emergence of classical spacetime from some underlying quantum structure, these objects are not to be regarded as truly fundamental. Rather, their status in string theory is analogous to the status of particles in quantum field theory (Witten, 2001), which is to say that they are relevant descriptions of the fundamental physics only in situations in which there is a background spacetime with appropriate symmetries.\nThe duality relations between the various string theories suggest that they are all perturbative expansions of some more fundamental, non-perturbative theory known as \u2018M-theory\u2019 (Polchinski, 2002, see the Other Internet Resources section below). This, presumably, is the most fundamental level, and understanding the theoretical framework at that level is central to understanding the underlying ontology of the theory. \u2018Matrix theory\u2019 is an attempt to do just this, to provide a mathematical formulation of M-theory, but it remains highly speculative. Thus although string theory purports to be a fundamental theory, the ontological implications of the theory are still obscure.\nCanonical quantum gravity, in its loop formulation or otherwise, has to date been of greater interest to philosophers because it appears to confront fundamental questions in a way that string theory, at least in its perturbative guise, does not. Whereas perturbative string theory treats spacetime in an essentially classical way, canonical quantum gravity treats it as quantum-mechanical, at least to the extent of treating the geometric structure (as opposed to, say, the topological or differential structure) as quantum-mechanical.\n5.1 Time\nAs noted in Section 4.2.2 above, the treatment of time presents special difficulties in canonical quantum gravity. These difficulties are connected with the special role time plays in physics, and in quantum theory in particular. Physical laws are, in general, laws of motion, of change from one time to another. They represent change in the form of differential equations for the evolution of, as the case may be, classical or quantum states; the state represents the way the system is at some time, and the laws allow one to predict how it will be in the future (or retrodict how it was in the past).\nIt is not surprising, then, that a theory of quantum spacetime would have a problem of time, because there is no classical time against which to evolve the \u201cstate\u201d. The problem is not so much that the spacetime is dynamical; there is no problem of time in classical general relativity. Rather, the problem is roughly that in quantizing the structure of spacetime itself, the notion of a quantum state, representing the structure of spacetime at some instant, and the notion of the evolution of the state, do not get any traction, since there are no real \u201cinstants\u201d. (In some approaches to canonical gravity, one fixes a time before quantizing, and quantizes the spatial portions of the metric only. This approach is not without its problems, however; see Isham (1993) for discussion and further references.)\nOne can ask whether the problem of time arising from the canonical program tells us something deep and important about the nature of time. Julian Barbour (2001a,b), for one, thinks that it tells us that time is illusory (see also Earman (2002) in this connection). It is argued that the fact that quantum states do not evolve under the super-Hamiltonian means that there is no change. However, it can also be argued (Weinstein, 1999a,b) that the super-Hamiltonian itself should not be expected to generate time-evolution; rather, one or more \u201ctrue\u201d Hamiltonians should play this role. (See Butterfield & Isham (1999) and Rovelli (2006) for further discussion.)\n5.2 Ontology\nThe problem of time is closely connected with a general puzzle about the ontology associated with \u201cquantum spacetime\u201d. Quantum theory in general resists any straightforward ontological reading, and this goes double for quantum gravity. In quantum mechanics, one has particles, albeit with indefinite properties. In quantum field theory, one again has particles (at least in suitably symmetric spacetimes), but these are secondary to the fields, which again are things, albeit with indefinite properties. On the face of it, the only difference in quantum gravity is that spacetime itself becomes a kind of quantum field, and one would perhaps be inclined to say that the properties of spacetime become indefinite. But space and time traditionally play important roles in individuating objects and their properties\u2014in fact a field is in some sense a set of properties of spacetime points \u2014 and so the quantization of such raises real problems for ontology.\nIn the loop quantum gravity program, the area and volume operators have discrete spectra. Thus, like spins, they can only take certain values. This suggests (but does not imply) that space itself has a discrete nature, and perhaps time as well (depending on how one resolves the problem of time). This in turn suggests that space does not have the structure of a differential manifold, but rather that it only approximates such a manifold on large scales, or at low energies.\n5.3 Status of quantum theory\nWhether or not spacetime is discrete, the quantization of spacetime entails that our ordinary notion of the physical world, that of matter distributed in space and time, is at best an approximation. This in turn implies that ordinary quantum theory, in which one calculates probabilities for events to occur in a given world, is inadequate as a fundamental theory. As suggested in the Introduction, this may present us with a vicious circle. At the very least, one must almost certainly generalize the framework of quantum theory. This is an important driving force behind much of the effort in quantum cosmology to provide a well-defined version of the many-worlds or relative-state interpretations. Much work in this area has adopted the so-called \u2018decoherent histories\u2019 or \u2018consistent histories\u2019 formalism, whereby quantum theories are understood to make probabilistic predictions about entire (coarse-grained) \u2018histories\u2019. Almost all of this work to date construes histories to be histories of spatiotemporal events, and thus presupposes a background spacetime; however, the incorporation of a dynamical, quantized spacetime clearly drives much of the cosmology-inspired work in this area.\nMore generally, one might step outside the framework of canonical, loop quantum gravity, and ask why one should only quantize the metric. As pointed out by Isham (1994, 2002), it may well be that the extension of quantum theory to general relativity requires one to quantize, in some sense, not only the metric but also the underlying differential structure and topology. This is somewhat unnatural from the standpoint where one begins with classical, canonical general relativity and proceeds to \u201cquantize\u201d (since the topological structure, unlike the metric structure, is not represented by a classical variable). But one might well think that one should start with the more fundamental, quantum theory, and then investigate under which circumstances one gets something that looks like a classical spacetime.\n5.4 Methodology\nThe nature of the enterprise, in particular its seeming remoteness from experiment, gives rise to significant methodological and epistemological questions as well, focusing on the problem of how to construct or discover a scientific theory for phenomena which are so remote from observation. Are beauty and consistency either necessary or sufficient? The pronounced split between the string theory community and the loop quantum gravity community has nothing to do with empirical success or lack thereof, but much to do with factors which might normally play a role only on the periphery of the scientific enterprise. The history of the enterprise of quantum gravity might well be worth historico-philosophical scrutiny, much as the history of cosmology has been, cosmology having also been rather data-starved until recently. (See Kragh (1999) for an excellent account of the big-bang/steady-state controversy.)\n6. Conclusion\nIn the author's opinion, it is unlikely that a final theory of quantum gravity \u2014 if indeed there is one \u2014 will look much like any of the current candidate theories, be they string theory, canonical gravity, or other approaches. However, the philosophical and conceptual study of quantum gravity is useful insofar as it prompts one to consider questions which are surely raised by this almost quixotic undertaking, questions which will ultimately require some unknown combination of philosophical, physical, and mathematical insight to answer.\nBibliography\n* Baez, J., 2001, \u201cHigher-dimensional algebra and Planck scale physics,\u201d in Callender & Huggett, 177-195, [Preprint available online].\n* Barbour, J., 2001a, \u201cOn general covariance and best matching,\u201d in Callender & Huggett, 199-212.\n* -----, 2001b, The End of Time: The Next Revolution in Physics, Oxford University Press, Oxford.\n* Bekenstein, J., 1973, \u201cBlack holes and entropy\u201d, Physical Review D 7, 2333-2346.\n* Belot, G. and Earman, J., 2001, \u201cPre-Socratic quantum gravity,\u201d in Callender & Huggett, 213-255.\n* Brown, H. and Pooley, O., 2001, \u201cThe origin of the spacetime metric: Bell's \u2018Lorentzian pedagogy\u2019 and its significance in general relativity,\u201d in Callender & Huggett, 256-272, [Preprint available online].\n* Butterfield, J. and Isham, C., 1999, \u201cOn the emergence of time in quantum gravity\u201d in The Arguments of Time, ed. by J.

Within a few decades, electricity, radio and TV, not to mention lasers, fiber optics, plastics and computers, have all become an everyday facet of our lives. I take for granted that I can turn on a TV set in Hawaii and receive, almost instantaneously, a program that originated in Atlanta or New York. Only a short time ago exchanging information between New York and Hawaii required the same time it takes to send a spacecraft to Mars today. Except for power failures, few people in the developed world know what it was like for most of the human species every night, throughout 99 percent of our history, to face the blackness of space and its sea of stars alone without the reassuring lights of civilization. We live in a special time. Never before has such intense, radical technological change taken place. In this chapter we will see that there has been another radical change: Something very strange has happened to reality along the way.\n\"O amazement of things--even the least particle!\"\n- Walt Whitman\nOur story will begin here because it is the electron, and our knowledge of it, that has been responsible for so much of the technology that we take for granted today. Without the electron there would be no electricity, no electric lights, no TV and no radio. We would not have supermarket doors that open automatically or computers to play video games and do word processing and spreadsheets for business. But what exactly is an electron? In the early moments of the 20th century, scientists found themselves asking this very question. The discovery of radiation and the atom promised to open up a strange new world of knowledge, understanding and power.\nAt first physicists assumed that the atom was like a miniature solar system. At the center was a nucleus consisting of particles glued together somehow, and circling this nucleus were the swiftly moving electrons, like little particle planets. This model did not last long. Although we still use a version of this model today to have some visual handle on what the atom looks like, scientists discovered fairly quickly that mathematical calculations based on this model predicted that the electron would crash into the nucleus in an instant.\nPhysicists also discovered that electrons could be stripped from the atoms and made into beams of radiation. This was a great breakthrough, because scientists could manipulate these beams and being to deduce from the beams' behavior the nature of the electron itself. A similar channel of investigation was taking place in attempting to understand the nature of light. From this, another remarkable discovery was made: beams of electrons behave very much like beams of light!\nWe saw in our study of Relativity that the speed of light was considered a paradox at the turn of the century. By this time the nature of light was also highly controversial and something of a paradox. Under some conditions light seemed to behave as if it consisted of very small particles of matter (now called photons). Under othe conditions, however, light showed clear signs of being a wave of energy, a disturbance of a medium, the intensity of which could be measured. To understand how this is a problem, we must first clearly understand that a particle and a wave are very different phenomena.\nA particle is a piece of matter, like a baseball, that at any given time has a definite size, speed and location. It can only be in one place at a time. A baseball thrown in Hawaii cannot be in New York at the same time. Furthermore, we assume that we may discover in this marvelous universe some very strange objects, but regardless of how strange they are, if they are objects, then they will have a definite location at any given definite time. Any object such as a baseball cannot be in two places at the same time.\nA wave, on the other hand, is a very different kind of thing. In fact, it is appropriate not to refer to it as a thing at all, but rather as an event or phenomenon. Things by definition have a definite localized size at a given definite time. Waves do not. Imagine dropping a pebble into a still pond of water. At first there is a small splash, and then circular waves move away from the spot where we dropped the pebble. The wave spreads out; it does not stay in one place, but it can be in many places at the same time. Also, it is the medium of the water that transmits the energy of the dropped pebble. The wave is simply a disturbance of the medium. It does not have an existence of its own like the smile of the Cheshire cat in \"Alice in Wonderland\". Without the water in the pond, there would be no waves.\nOn the north shore of the island of Oahu in the State of Hawaii, every winter large waves pound the shoreline. These waves are caused by the seasonal winter storms migrating northeast of the state in the jet stream on their way to make life miserable for people in the Pacific Northwest and eventually much of the rest of the United States. The winds from the migrating storms cause a significant disturbance in the sea and a series of undulations or transmitted many miles until finally, reaching the reef on the north shore of Oahu, spectacular waves of 20 feet or higher break and push forward a mountain of water and foam toward the beach. On the cliffs overlooking Waimea Bay you can watch a gigantic half circle of water march relentlessly toward the beach and then simultaneously, across a quarter mile area, surge onto the beach. It is a spectacular sight. Tourists travel many thousands of miles to see it, and single-minded surfers wait in anticipation all year, hoping to be the first to ride the biggest wave on record and survive.\nIt would be a strange event indeed if one day, while watching wave after wave break, we saw one wave flow in its normal way toward the beach and then, just as the wave was about to touch the first fingers of vulnerable sand, the entire half circle of water collapsed instantly to a single unpredictable point on the beach and exploded! The wave would have turned into a massive particle located at one place, rather than spread out as waves normally are. Imagine wave after wave doing this, with the location of the collapse being unpredictable each time. Strange indeed this would be, but something like this is what electrons and photons seem to do!\nThought Experiments\n\"All of modern physics is governed by that magnificent and thoroughly confusing discipline called quantum mechanics... It has survived all tests and there is no reason to believe that there is any flaw in it... We all know how to use it and how to apply it to problems; and so we have learned to live with the fact that nobody can understand it.\"\n- Murray Gell-Mann\nThe science of the subatomic realm is called quantum physics or quantum mechanics. The word \"quantum\" refers to the fact that energy at the microscopic realm comes in packets, or quanta; energy is said to be \"discrete\" rather than continuous. The best way of understanding the implications of discrete motion is to understand the most famous phrase in this science, the \"quantum jump\". As we will soon see, this does not refer to a continuous, quick motion of an object, but rather a discontinuous, instantaneous movement from one place to another. In orders words, quantum objects seem to be able to move from place to place without being anywhere in between. They seem to \"pop\" in and out of existence.\nIn the following pages, we are going to retrace the same baffling steps that physicists have taken in the past 70 years. Their goal was simply to understand the nature of subatomic objects such as the electron and the photon. The result was a revolution in thought so radical that even Einstein could not accept it. But we will be using a method Einstein would have approved of, what are called \"thought experiments\". Instead of looking at the actual technical experiments (in most cases), we will imagine a series of composite pictures that remain true to the actual experimental findings. Technically, these are known as the Photoelectric effect, Compton effect, Young and Davisson-Germer diffraction wave experiments, Stern-Gerlach interferometer experiments, Bell's inequality theorem, and the Aspect experiments.\nImagine first a lead box impenetrable except for two microscopic slits on one side. On the inside of the box on the side opposite the slits is a photographic film. Imagine that on the outside facing the two slits we have a source of radiation, beams of electrons or light, and that we aim this radiation at the face of the box with the two slits. By looking at the kind of exposure that results on the photographic film, we can deduce what kind of radiation is penetrating the box. For instance, if the radiation consists of beams of particles, then only those particles that happen to be aligned with the two slits will pass through into the box , and the result should be a \"particle effect\". The photographic film should show a diffused piling up of little hits adjacent to the two slits.\nOn the other hand, if radiation is a wave, then a much different effect should result. We should see a \"wave effect\", roughly what we would see if we dropped two stones in the water at the same time. Two circular undulations would collide into each other and interfere with each other. In our example, a wave would split in two as it enters the two slits, and then the two new waves would begin to spread out again, eventually colliding with each other as in our pond example. This should cause an \"interference effect\", a wave picture, on the photographic film. Instead of a piling effect adjacent to the two slits, the radiation would spread throughout the length of the photographic film, producing alternating bands of exposure. Some of the wave crests would meet and accentuate each other, and some would meet the troughs of other waves and cancel each other. The exposed bands on the photographic film would be the result of the crests meeting.\nWhen similar experiments are done, the result is remarkable. The photographic film always shows an interference effect indicating a wave (see the figure part a). Unfortunately, the radiation produces this same effect in passing through a vacuum. How can a wave exist without a medium to disturb? Also, when we look closely at the exposure of the film, the exposed areas show piles of little hits, as if millions of particles hit the film, each blackening only a single grain of film in unpredictable locations (d). Remember that if radiation is a wave, then as it reaches the film, it should be spread out along the entire length of the film like a wave breaking in a beach. But how can it hit at only one unpredictable place? This is as ridiculous as the possibility of watching a wave move toward a beach and seeing the entire wave collapse at a single point on the beach!\nObviously, more experiments are necessary. Baffling results are common in science. So let's close one of the slits and see what happens. Perhaps the particles are so small that as they penetrate the slits they ricochet all over the interior of the chamber, bouncing off each other in a wild, unpredictable manner that eventually produces the illusion of an interference effect. After all, the electron is about 10,000 times smaller in mass than an average atom. Thus, in closing one of the slits, we would lessen this wild ricocheting, and a piling effect should result adjacent to the single slit. Sometimes, nature cooperates. If we alternate opening and closing each slit, then the result appears to be consistent with the particle hypothesis--a double-piling effect adjacent to each slit (b).\nBut wait. To be sure that we are dealing with a particle, let's return to our original setup with two slits open simultaneously. This time, however, we will lower the intensity of the radiation. In other words, another way to lessen the possibility of the ricocheting effect, and at the same time rule out the wave hypothesis is to filter the radiation to such a point that only a single \"measure\" of radiation passes through into the chamber at a time. If we assume that the radiation consists of particles, then if only a single particle is passing through at a time, it can go through only one slit or the other. If it is a particle, then it cannot be in two places at the same time and thus will not ricochet off of other particles or itself.\nConducting this experiment will take a long time for an exposure to develop because millions of particle hits will be required to make an exposure, and each particle has three choices: to penetrate the chamber through either of the two slits or be repulsed by the lead barrier. Nevertheless, we should eventually observer a particle effect--a double-piling effect of hits adjacent to the two slits, as in (b).\nAlas, nature fails to cooperate. The result is an interference effect, exactly as in (a) and (d)! Now we are really in trouble. Why should we get a wave effect with two slits open, even though the exposure is the result of two unpredictable hits, and a particle effect with only one slit open? With two slits open the radiation is acting as though it penetrates the chamber at two places simultaneously (then it interferes with itself), something only a wave can do. With one slit, however, the radiation is more localized, as we would expect from particles, which can only be in one place at a time.\nIt is easy for the beginner to lose sight of the philosophical significance of these results. Many of the great names of science, however, who were working at this baffling microscopic realm, also had a background in philosophy, and it was immediately apparent to them that there was something major at stake here. Since the time of the ancient Greeks and the fledgling beginnings of scientific exploration, we have assumed that we are dealing with one world, one consistent reality. That is, even though we expect the world to be baffling at times, with strange and new details of discoveries, we also expect that whatever these details are, they stay the same independent of our knowing. They are \"out there\" waiting for us to discover, and they are what they are regardless of our knowledge or ignorance.\nWe assume as Newton did that the world does not depend on us or how we choose to make our observations of it. We do not expect something to be a particle on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays and a wave on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays--especially when these phenomena are entirely different types of phenomena. What kind of a world would it be for us if dogs were dogs on Mondays but turned into cats on Tuesdays? It would surely make dealing with the world and taking care of pets very difficult.\nBecause this notion is so important, let's try one more example. What we want to know is, does the radiation pass through both open slits simultaneously or only through one? Consider then the following experimental arrangement: both slits open, one measure of radiation entering the chamber at a time, but with an added feature--a detection device inside the chamber that will reveal whether or not the radiation is passing through both slits as a wave or only one or the other of the slits as a particle would (c). Because the situation is almost identical to the case in which an interference effect was recorded (a), we would expect to see the detection device react as though a wave were surging through both opening simultaneously. On the other hand, if the radiation consists of particles, then only one instance of detection should be recorded at a time. Remarkably, the latter is the case--only one instance of detection is recorded at a time--and the photographic result is now consistent with the arrangement of only one slit or the other being open, as in (b)!!\nAs physicists in this century conducted further experiments with subatomic phenomena, they found that all subatomic phenomena display the same ambiguity, which has come to be known as wave-particle duality . This ambiguity was not easy to accept. One of the most fundamental principles of science seemed to be mocked by these results: the notion that we are dealing with, and can know the details of, the objective world. It is perhaps one of the greatest achievements of this century that in spite of this shock, a very successful mathematics was developed that not only allowed physicists to predict the results of the above experiments but also produced one of the greatest scientific and technological success stories in recorded history. In 1926 the physicist Erwin Schrodinger gave us the Schrodinger wave equation, and the science of physics has never been quite the same. The equation \"explains\" the preceding results but with a high \"price\" to be exacted from our own common-sense view of the world.\nAs we would expect from the name, the equation literally portrays the radiation as a wave, but a very strange wave. According to the equation, in our two-slits-open configuration as soon as the radiation leaves its preparation point, it begins to spread out in a strange multidimensional \"hyperspace\". As it encounters the slits it splits, as any real wave would, passing into the chamber and interfering with itself. Remember, this is one indivisible unit of radiation! As the radiation touches the photographic film, however, it regains its physical indivisibility by collapsing to a single unpredictable point! We can never predict at what point the radiation will be received, but we can always, with a remarkable consistency, predict the probability of where it will strike and the overall statistical pattern, not only for this particular arrangement but for all the others as well.\nFew physicists, however, accept this literal interpretation; most have been taught to think of the equation as a calculation device. The special mathematical function used is thought to represent only a \"probability function\"--that is, given initial conditions, the probability of finding a hit, or a pattern of hits, at a particular location. Thus, the only waves the exist are said to be \"probability waves\".\nBut wait. What happened to reality? What is a probability wave? What is an electron? What is a photon? Are these questions no longer meaningful? Let's look at one more example...\nIn the figure above, imagine a light source directed at a half-silvered mirror, a mirror covered with a very light reflective coating. Such a mirror functions as a beam-splitter, and if we assume that light consists of little particles called photons, then the physical properties of the half-silvered mirror should cause each photon to either pass through the mirror or be reflected at an angle. Thus, if we set up photon detectors at the appropriate angles, at points A and B, individual detections at A or B should result. With this experimental arrangement, the mathematics predicts that over a sufficient period of time 50 percent of the light will be received by A and 50 percent by B. Furthermore, if the intensity is lowered through filtering, such that only a single photon approaches the mirror at a time, then only a single whole photon should be detected at a time. Detections at A and B should never be recorded simultaneously.\nWhen such an experiment is actually conducted, it is a relatively simple matter to show that one whole unit of energy is detected at either A or B, confirming again that we are dealing with a single object, a little thing that can be at only one place at a time. If a photon is a particle, then it will pass through the mirror and be detected at A or be reflected and detected at B. However, the Schrodinger equation is a wave equation. Although we must be careful using such language, according to this equation, the half-silvered mirror splits a wave packet into two \"hyperspatial, virtual/real, probability\" waves.\nAt the exact moment that the energy reaches the detectors, some sort of strange decision is made, and the entire unit of energy is received at only one point, at either A or B! The wave packet collapses. If a whole unit is received at A, then the energy that was approaching B has jumped over to A. In addition, the equation predicts this will happen even if the two detectors are separated by many light-years, even if one detector is much closer to the half-silvered mirror than the other. The latter case implies that the energy approaches A and either jumps to A or the energy that was approaching A goes \"backward in time\" and collapses at B. The mathematics always works, but what it describes literally seems impossible. Like Alice in Wonderland, we cannot believe in impossible things...can we? So physicists explain that we must not think of the split wave packets as real, but only as a description of the probability of where photons will go.\nBut wait. Now comes the crucial question. Does the light really pass through both channels? Quantum jumping aside, we can at least test for the radiation passing through both channels. Consider the following arrangement (lower half of the figure). This time we will create an interferometer by placing totally reflecting mirrors at the points where detectors A and B were. Thus, if the light beam is really split by the half-silvered mirror, the totally reflecting mirrors will now reflect the split beams of light. If we aim these totally reflecting mirrors so that the beams will meet again, then we can take a picture of the waves interfering with each other, just as we did in the two-slit experiment. With this arrangement, interference fringes result similar to that found in the two-slit experiment. The interference effect can be produced by having one of the totally reflecting mirrors slightly farther away than the other, so that the light waves will arrive out of phase. The beams are recombined by another half-silvered mirror and transmitted to a chamber with a photographic plate.\nIf the intensity of the light is reduced to one photon at a time, then the interference effect can only be accounted for by assuming that the photon really splits into two wave packets and then recombines. In fact, if we pick up an ordinary playing card and block one of the paths, there is no interference picture. Instead, a diffused piling exposure is created, similar to the particle picture we received when only one slit was open. If the radiation is a wave, then we can understand the interference picture. If the radiation is a particle, then we can understand the fact that only one detector at a time receives one whole unit of energy. The result of one arrangement indicates that a wave of some kind is really passing through both channels simultaneously. The result of the other makes sense, if we assume that the radiation is passing through only one channel at a time. If the radiation is passing through both channels at the same time, why do the detectors not trigger simultaneously? How does the radiation passing through one channel get over to the other detector? How could this possibly happen if the detectors are far enough away that any transmission of a signal between them would require a speed greater than the speed of light? It's time for a little philosophy.\n\"We have sought for firm ground and found none. The deeper we penetrate, the more restless becomes the universe; all is rushing about and vibrating in a wild dance.\"\n- Max Born\nNature at the subatomic level apparently does not conform to normal logic. Either light is a particle or it is not a particle. Either light is a wave or it is not a wave. Either the light splits and goes through both channels or it does not. If it goes through both channels, then it should be detected in both channels. It is not detected in both channels, yet it does go through both channels. If it goes through both channels, why is only one unit of energy detected at one detector? How do two halves spatially separated become one whole unit instantaneously?\nThere is no logical inconsistency within the mathematics that explains the phenomena. In the particle effect case, the mathematics allows us to predict that approximately 50 percent of the time detector A will record a unit of energy and 50 percent of the time detector B will record a unit of energy. In the interferometer arrangement, the mathematics predicts an interference effect and even allows a straightforward calculation of the wave length of light by measuring the interference fringes. The problem is more in our reaction to the results of these experiments and the success of the mathematics. We want to know what kind of a \"thing\" is producing these results. What is going on out there that enables the mathematics to be successful? Our minds desire a complete understanding. What is real? What is the truth?\nThese questions reflect our natural tendency to want to go deeper, to find the basic, hidden causes of all things. Western civilization and its science since the ancient Greeks has assumed that the cosmos consists of one distinct, complete reality full of details. We have also assumed that the details, whatever they might be, can be known, and knowing these details does not affect what the details actually are independent of the knower. This is consistent with our common sense and what each of us experiences every day: a world undisturbed by human thoughts, wishes, and desires...full of things, spatially separated from each other, and interacting with each other through distinct recognizable forces. If someone has a tangerine tree in his yard, he might wish that it were an apple tree, but it will still be a tangerine tree. Similarly, we do not think of someone thinking cancer into existence or wishing it away. We think of the cancer being \"out there\", something beyond our mental control, like trees. We can cut down trees and operate on cancer, but they are distinct realities that we \"discover\" with our thinking, not something that we \"create\" with our thinking.\nSo it is natural for us to think of the electron as an independent thing. It shows signs of being a particle, so we begin to think of it as if it is really a particle independent of our observations of it. But it also shows signs of being a wave, and it cannot be both a wave and a particle at the same time, no more than a tree can be both a tangerine and apple tree at the same time.\nIn the 1920s, a few philosophically minded physicists, led by the Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Niels Bohr, realized that nature was trying to tell us something very important. Once again nature was using paradox to convey a fundamental error in the assumptions we were making and the way we were asking our questions. According to Bohr, and what is known as the Copenhagen Interpretation (so-called because much of the work was done in Copenhagen, Denmark), descriptions such as \"particle\", \"wave\", \"position\" and \"mass\" are human concepts. These concepts involving assumptions of space and time work for us at a normal macroscopic level and will always be indispensible for describing the results of our physical experiments. But nature is now making it clear to us that we have reached a barrier in our attempt to describe it in terms of human concepts derived from ordinary experience.\nWave-particle duality is nature's way of informing us that we have no right to impose our human concepts on the subatomic level. Just as Einstein had discovered that we have no right to impose our normal assumptions of space and time to all levels of reality, so quantum physics reveals that we have no right to impose our most basic thoughts about the nature of reality on the subatomic realm. The idea of an extended thing sitting in a three-dimensional space, waiting for us to discover it, is revealed as another human projection, a limited image of reality, more of an echo of the way our minds work than of reality itself. According to Bohr, nature reveals this to us by showing that we can have only complementary views of reality. If we set up an experimental arrangement to view subatomic phenomena as particles, then that is what we will observe. According to Heisenberg, another major contributor to the Copenhagen Interpretation, what we observe in our experiments is not nature itself but nature exposed to our methods of questioning nature. In short, an electron is not a thing until we observe it!\n\"First they told us the world was flat. Then they told us it was round. Now they are telling us it isn't even there!\"\n- Irving Oyle\nIronically, the main resistance to the Copenhagen Interpretation came from Albert Einstein and a few of his followers. Einstein objected very much to the idea that we had stumbled upon a barrier to knowing what is real. Philosophically, Einstein was a realist who believed that the goal of science was to conjecture boldly about the nature of reality from the details of our observations. He acknolwedged that as we continue to probe nature for her secrets, we would encounter more and more exotic features, most of which we could never directly observe because of the nature of our observational limitations. He believed, however, that the human mind could always fathom at least the most likely hypothesis about the nature of the reality causing the events we do observe. Thus, although Einstein introduced a revolutionary view of space and time, one that destroyed the classical or Newtonian conceptions of absolute space and time, he nevertheless remained a classical physicist faithful to the concept of reality. Descartes stated centuries earlier: \"There is nothing so far removed from us to be beyond our reach or so hidden that we cannot discover it.\"\nFor Einstein, nature was like a mysterious clock. We are limited to observing only the exterior features of this clock. We may never be able to see directly inside and know for ceratin how the clock works, but by observing and thinking about the movement of the hands long enough, the human mind will provide a likely answer to how the clock works. For Einstein, a clockwork for the universe exists and can be known. For Bohr, to assume that a clockwork exists independent of our observations is only another human philsophical bias, another example in a long line of assumptions that experience validates at a certain level, but that experience at another level now demonstrates cannot be considered \"the way things are\".\nIf an electron is not a thing until it is observed by some instrument, does this not imply that reality depends on our observations and hence, ultimately, the thoughts we use to frame the world? Does this not imply that reality is created by human thoughts? Metaphysical idealism is an old and widespread belief stating that the physical world as we experience it is basically an illusion; the perception of a world of material things separated in space is said to be only an appearance. Individual things exist only insofar as we have an idea of them. If there were no human observer or recording instrument of any kind in a forest, then a falling tree would make no sound. In fact, there would be no tree to fall and no forest. When I walk out of a room, I assume that the physical room and all its contents are still there. But according to the idealist, the room ceases to exist if no one is there to have a thought of the room.\nMost scientists have always viewed this metaphysics with disdain, as more of a symptom of despair of the sometimes harsh realities of the physical world, as primarily a religious view associated with those who find the physical universe threatening and who desire a more perfect but duller world. Does quantum physics validate the philosophy of idealism? How embarrassing for Western science if it does. Imagine that after thousands of years of struggling to know the details of the atom, Western science shipwrecks into a religious philosophy it thought it had left behind at a more primitive time!\nThus, Einstein viewed quantum physics as an incomplete theory: We simply do not know enough yet. Because we cannot produce a consistent picture of subatomic phenomena, we obviously do not know exactly what these things are yet or enough about the mysterious forces governing their motions and manifestations. \"God does not play dice with the universe\", according to Einstein. He has created one universe and does not choose to have it manifest itself as waves one moment and as particles at another for no reason.\nBohr and Einstein had several public debates over what was the proper interpretation of quantum physics. These were fascinating discussions between two intellectual giants, but little was resolved at the time. The vast majority of physicists heeded Bohr's advice that there was a pragmatic limitation inherent in our measuring devices. Physicists should be interested primarily in being able to predict experimental results and not in the question of what is real. They were persuaded that the question of what is real is primarily an unanswerable philosophical question. Physics must concern itself primarily with complex experimental arrangements and the derivation of the complex mathematical formuale needed to predict events. On the other hand, motivated by the goal of finding a hidden reality, physicists have also pursued Einstein's dream of a unified picture of reality, of seeking a theory that enables us to understand at a fundamental level the mysterious forces of nature.\nPhysics is still proceeding in two, perhaps complementary, perhaps schizophrenic, directions--one following Einstein's dream and the other developing a series of experiments to confirm Bohr's theory of complementarity. Using a particle approach and a model of subatomic objects consisting of different types of quarks, many physicists have become confident that they are approaching an understanding of the basic clockwork of the universe. These physicists believe that what appear at a certain level to be different forces in nature are actually different manifestations of a superforce, a force that existed for only a brief moment under the superhot, superenergetic conditions of the first microseconds of the universe.\nBecause of the present relatively mild conditions of the universe, this force is hidden from us, and because it is hidden we are left with the many paradoxical results of quantum appearances. Thus, throughout the world the race is on, with billions of dollars being spent, to set up the wild conditions that will, it is thought, finally coax nature into revealing her true self. And there are those who, like Paul Davies in his book \"Superforce\", have declared confidently, not unlike Helmholtz did for Newtonian physics, \"that for the first time in history we have within our grasp a complete scientific theory of the whole universe in which no physical object or system lies outside a small set of basic scientific principles\".\n\"Bell's theorem is easy to understand but hard to believe.\"\n-- Nick Herbert\nBut does nature have a \"true\" self? Following Bohr, experiments have been conducted that are consistent with the view that it does not, that in our relationshiop with the universe we can have only different pictures of the clockwork--actually, to be more precise, that a precise clockwork does not exist until we attempt to picture it! For many years, following the Bohr-Einstein debates it was thought that the issue between them must forever be relegated to the realm of inconclusive philosophical perspectives. No one knew of a conceivable experiment that could disconfirm either one. Bohr could argue that the present experimental data are most consistent with his theory of complementarity, but he could not prove that some day we would not discover some bizarre \"hidden\" reality that explained how an electron could manifest itself as a wave in one situation and a particle in another. Similarly, the followers of Einstein could argue that if we think, and search, long enough, someday we will find this hidden reality. No one though an experiment could be devised that would eliminate the possibility of a hidden reality.\nIn 1964 physicist John Bell discovered that it was theoretically possible to test whether or not quantum physics was a complete theory. By tinkering with the mathematics, he discovered that an experiment could be devised to confirm or disconfirm hidden processes, or \"variables\" as physicists refer to them.\nBefore we describe this discovery and its application in crucial experiments, let us review first why quantum measurements are so puzzling. The essence of all the puzzles, according to the physicist Henry Stapp, is \"How do energy and information get around so fast?\" In the interferometer experiment we can demonstrate that a wave is passing through both channels. But when we modify the experiment to detect the radiation in each channel, we detect only one whole unit of energy at a time per channel, implying not only that the radiation consists of particles, and therefore not waves, but also that the radiation is not in both channels.\nIn the particle detection experiment the Schrodinger equation describes a wave-splitting process with a \"probability\" wave in both channels and then an instantaneous collapse of a potential existence to one localized \"actual\" spot, to either detector A or B. The Copenhagen Interpretation deals with this puzzle by claiming it is inappropriate to think of radiation as some kind of real thing before we measure it. The radiation \"becomes\" something only after we measure it. It is always a particle after we measure it, even though some measurements suggest the particle has wavelike properties between measurements. Reality, specific attributes possessed by things, according to the Copenhagen Interpretation, can only be discussed in terms of an \"entire experimental arrangement\".\nAccording to Bohr, the problem of quantum measurement does not necessarily imply an idealist metaphysics. Concepts such as \"particle\" and \"wave\" are human concepts, and we have discovered that nature will not allow us to picture it consistently with these concepts. Insofar as we must always conduct our experiments through a human framework, with human concepts, there is an epistemological barrier that no future scientific discovery will change. For Bohr, the success of quantum theory represents a \"treasure chest\" of scientific and philosophical discoveries. The Copenhagen Interpretation should not be viewed as advocating a dogmatic end to reserach and discovery but rather a dramatic discovery that continues a trend first started by Copernicus and sustained most recently by the startling discoveries of Einstein: The universe is not required to conform to human concepts.\nIn a fundamental way Bell's discovery allowed physicists to test Bohr's claimed epistemological discovery. We could now see whether or not the subatomic realm had a true self independent of our measurements.\n\"The hope that new experiments will lead us back to objective events in time and space is about as well founded as the hope of discovering the end of the world in the unexplored regions of the Antarctic.\"\n-- Werner Heisenberg\nBecause the actual experiments and Bell's discovery are somewhat complex, let us try an analogy first. Suppose we have a large group of runners. Half of the runners are tall and half are short. Suppose that each of the short runners and each of the tall runners has a twin. Each of the twins will begin running at the same point, but in the opposite direction to a finish line that is the same distance from the original point of departure. Suppose also that each runner will run the course at the same speed, and that the spacing between the times when each runner leaves is such that no runner will be able to overtake the runner immediately preceding him. No tall runners will overtake short runners or vice versa.\nImagine then a continuous stream of runners leaving the original point and running in opposite directions. We might have something like this: Two short runners leave the starting point one after the other simultaneous with their respective twins, then two tall, then two short again, then one tall, and one short after that, then two tall, and so on. Suppose that the overall pattern is random. Suppose further that the contingencies of the course and physical training of each runner are such that many of the runners will not finish. Suppose also that each twin has a very strong desire to finish, such that any one twin will want to finish if and only if the other twin finishes.\nNow we are ready to carry out the implications of our thought experiment. In spite of the strong desire of each twin to finish if and only if the other does, our common sense would predict that finishing together is not likely. Suppose one of the short runners pulls a muscle just before the finish line. How likely would it be that the twin, running on an independent track, separated by a considerable distance, either knows this and decides to stop running or pulls a muscle and also does not finish? In other words, if we were to observe the runners finishing and established a mathematical correlation of completion, we would not expect it to be very high. Suppose that about 90 percent of the tall and short runners did not finish; it would not be likely that every time a short or tall runner finished or did not finish, the respective twin finished or did not finish as well. If we found the random result at one finish like to be T, T, S, T, S, S, T, S, we would not expect this result to be highly correlated or equal to the result at the other finish line. We would expect an inequality in the results.\nThere is one possibility, however, where the results could be highly correlated. Suppose each runner carried an electronic beeper, such that whenever a runner knew he could not finish, he would signal the twin not to finish. In other words, if the runners could communicate, a very high correlation could be established.\nSuppose though that we change our thought experiment a little. This time we will control, at one finish line, which runners finish and which ones do not. Suppose at a point immediately before one of the finish lines we set up a fork in the course, such that the short runners must take one path and the tall runners must take the other. Suppose further that we have control over an electronic switch that closes the path by throwing up a barrier for either the short or tall runners. By randomly changing the switch we can change which path is open and which type of runner finishes. It is important to be able to do this after the runners have already left. Otherwise the runners could know ahead of time what kind of course they must run and adjust their actions accordingly. Suppose that the barriers are so close to the finish line, and we are able to switch the barriers so rapidly, that there is no time for each twin to signal the other whether he is going to finish or not. Now clearly there could not possibly be a very high correlation. It would be a strange result, indeed, if even most of the time when a tall runner finished, his twin also finished, and most of the time when one did not, his twin did not, and likewise for the short runners.\nWe assume that the locla conditions at a barrier cannot instantaneously influence the local conditions at the other finish line. This locality assumption is an inherent part of our normal view of reality. We assume that the runners are independent individuals who will face independent conditions at independent places. What Bell showed is that if this assumption is correct and also applies to the subatomic realm, then the results we obtain in the subatomic realm with particles should reflect the same kind of inequality in correlation we expect to find in our macroscopic realm of short and tall runners.\nQuantum theory, on the other hand, predicts an entirely different situation for subatomic particles. Because it is incorrect to refer to subatomic particles as having any definite state with a definite place until a measurement takes place, an analogous runner's example to what happens in the subatomic realm would be the following: Our runners do not exist as definite runners until they are observed to finish, and a measurement at one finish line will instantaneously produce a correlated set of characteristics at the other finish line! From a quantum perspective, the locality assumption is denied; it is incorrect to think of our runners as real independent entities, in real independent places, experiencing real, local, independent circumstances. Instead, between the time we see them leave and finish, our runners are a \"superposition of states\" of existence. They are neither tall, nor short, nor fast nor slow, but all these potential states at once.\nIf quantum theory is true, then an analogous experiment in the subatomic realm should result in a significant violation of Bell's inequality deduction because it is incorrect to think of subatomic particles as independent things with definite properties until a measurement takes place. If experiments are devised where \"twin\" particles are created and fly off in opposite directions like our runners, then quantum theory predicts that there will be a high correlation of the particle states when they are measured at a quantum finish line because a measurement of one particle instantaneously collapses a wave function of potential states, a wave function that was created at the time of the twin particle creation.\n\"No elementary phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is a recorded phenomenon.\"\n- John Archibald Wheeler\nPerhaps because the locality assumption is so obvious, or perhaps because the technological tools were not sufficiently developed to conduct the proper experiments, or both, recognition of the significance of Bell's work was slow in coming. A decade after Bell published his work, intense discussion and experimental work finally began. The most recent experimental results, based on a design that physicists acknowledged ahead of time would be the crucial experiment, show decisively that in the subatomic realm Bell's inequality is violated and the predictions of quantum theory are correct. The results show that the measurement of a subatomic particle at one finish line instantaneously determines the state of its twin at another finish line, regardless of how far apart the two finish lines are.\nIn the realm of subatomic particles, our runners are replaced by mathematical objects with attributes such as \"charge\", \"spin\", \"velocity\" and \"momentum\". We naturally tend to think of these attributes in the same way we think of the attributes of our runners. Just as we think of each runner as a real, independent body with definite characteristics such as being short or tall, fast or slow, we are more comfortable thinking of a particle having a real location or a real spin. Quantum physics, however, seldom allows us to be comfortable. Consider quantum spin. What kind of real attribute requires a subatomic particle to turn around twice before it shows its original face?! Imagine looking at a position on the Earth from the Moon, say New York, and watching the Earth spin around twice before New York is visible again.\nAs bizarre as these quantum attributes are, quantum physicists have learned how to deal with them mathematically and even set up experiments that create twin particles with opposite spin. The most recent, and most conclusive, we will call the Aspect experiment (after the French physicist Alain Aspect, who was the leader of a team that conducted this crucial experiment. The results were published in an unassuming three-page paper \"Experimental Tests of Realistic Local Theories via Bell's Theorem\", Physics Review Letters, Aug 17, 1981). Using polarization, a property that can be thought of as similar to spin (\"polarized\" sunglasses only allow photons of light through with particular spin orientations, thus selectively lessening the intensity of light that passes through), physicists tested Bell's inequality prediction. Atoms were excited to produce twin photons of light that sped away with opposite polarization. Methods were developed to test the states of the photons at their respective finish lines. In many respects this experiment was analagous to our thought experiment with the barriers and the electronic switch.\nBell's inequality theorem was violated: The spins of particles at distant finish lines were highly correlated. Because there was an analagous switching device (activated by high-frequency waves at a rate of 100 million times per second...the finish lines were 10 meters apart), there was no possibility that a signal could be sent (at the speed of light) between the two devices for photons crossing the \"finish lines\" to communicate, thus enabling their spins to be correlated through conventional means (so they must have been correlated through some strange quantum effect). In summary, the result was as fantastic as our hypothetical, unlikely thought experiment concerning runners, that most of the time a tall runner finishes or does not finish, so does the twin, and the same is true for short runners. There is now little doubt that a violation of Bell's inequality is a fact of life. If there is a \"hidden reality\" with forces influencing the results of our paradoxical measurements, these forces must travel faster than the speed of light. They must be instantaneous.\nNote that the violation of Bell's inequality is a \"factual\" demonstration that at least one assumption of Einstein's realism must be false, what we referred to earlier as the locality assumption. To accept the totality of Einstein's realism, we must assume that the local conditions at one finish line could influence the local conditions at the other finish line only if the two locations are linked by a causal chain whose transmission of effects does not exceed the speed of light. In other words, if reality consists of separate objects, then one object cannot influence another object unless some sort of signal or influence travels from one object to the other during some amount of time. If the movement of one object \"instantaneously\" influences the movement of another object, then they are not really separate objects.\nRecall from Chapter 7 that some very strange results are possible if the speed of light can be exceeded. Our mother astronaut could return to Earth and be involved in a fatal automobile accident before her child was conceived and before leaving for her space voyage. Thus, for many reasons, a hidden force traveling faster than the speed of light is ruled out as a possible explanation for the puzzling results of quantum experiments. The Aspect experiment shows that we must reject the totality of Einstein's realism, but not necessarily all possible versions of realism. The entire universe at the subatomic level could be one object.\nThe results of the Aspect experiment and the violation of Bell's inequality are also consistent with the Copenhagen interpretation: Quantum objects should not be considered things until a measurement takes place. Unfortunately, the implications of this interpretation for the nature of reality are philosophically disturbing for most physicists when they bother to think about them. Thus, most physicists ignore the pragmatic aspect of the Copenhagen interpretation and ignore the reality question. The reality question is something for \"the philosophers\" to worry about. This response is often portrayed as a sophisticated, modern point of view: physics should not be concerned with futile philsophical questions, but keep to the business of predicting results and applying quantum mathematics to novel situations such as computer technology, fiber optics, chemistry, and even biology. By any standard this approach has been very successful. However, is this instrumentalist approach any different from the reaction of past scientists to Ptolemy's epicycles, Copernicus' circles around invisible points or Newton's gravity?\n\"No language which lends itself to visualizability can describe quantum jumps.\"\n- Max Born\nFor many, the reality question beckons still. The history of physics, and science in general, shows that the traditional pursuit of \"the way things really are\" is not just an ivory tower game. A quest for a deep understanding has been valuable not only for its own sake but for the purpose of maximum practical application as well. The history of science has demonstrated repeatedly that when we understand the way things are at an invisible level, we are better able to understand, control, and predict the visible world in which we live. Until quantum physics, the vast span of scientific endeavor had vindicated Einstein's simple vision: The better we have been able to understand the invisible mechanism of the cosmic clock, the better we have been able to understand the motions of its visible hands. We may not be able to see Kepler's ellipses or Newton's gravity in the starry night, but an understanding of these veiled realities has enabled us to embrace the night sky-to predict, to control, to see, to explore-in a manner undreamt of by the ancients so patiently and relentlessly watched this surface reality. Other examples abound: The understanding of the molecular and atomic constitution of matter has enabled us to deal with the surface experiences of heat, temperature and pressure; by understanding a deeper level of reality, we have been able to create objects that do not exist in nature, such as plastics; and now, by understanding the invisible structure of DNA, we are close to controlling the development of life itself, with many practical applications in agriculture and medicine.\nIs it over? The Copenhagen interpretation implies a strange kind of ignorance-call it quantum ignorance. According to Bohr, it is a mistake to search for a hidden, deeper mechanism that will explian the results of quantum measurements, because between measurements there is nothing there to know, that is, nothing there can be conceptualized in human terms. This is nature's way of educating us, of revealing its ultimate message: \"Picture me with your human pictures if you must, but do not take your pictures too seriously.\"\nFor those sympathetic with Einstein, there must be something more; the results of quantum experiments must be only an example of what can be called classical ignorance. There must be something there that we are \"disturbing\" when we interact with it in attempting to measure it. We are ignorant of why quantum events happen as they do only because we do not know all the forces acting on subatomic particles, just as we cannot predict each throw of the dice in a dice game, because there are too many minute factors involved and any attempt on our part to measure these minute factors in the act would disturb the results. In the case of dice there are other ways of demonstrating the existence of these factors, and thus we have every reason to believe that they are there, even if we cannot control them.\nBell's theorem and the consequent experiments do not rule out some kind of realism, that some kind of hidden force or reality is at work in the subatomic realm. The do demonstrate, however, that these forces, if they exist, must be very strange forces. Unlike any previously discovered forces, they must be capable of propagating instantaneously regardless of distance. If our finish lines for subatomic particles were billions of miles away, then the violation of inequality would be the same. If one of our finish lines were located in the vicinity of the star Betelgeuse, 540 light-years distant, and the other on Earth, then quantum physics predicts that there would be no difference in the results. The results of Bell's theorem and the Aspect experiment show not only that quantum theory is a complete theory but also that any interpretation of quantum physics must incorporate the fact of instantaneous action.\nNewtonianism implies that what is real does not depend on us, and reality is reducible to small independent particles of physical matter and empty space; thoughts, ideas, colors, emotions are all considered to be secondary realities, not real, but rather the result of the movement and interactions of particles. This view is seriously contradicted by the science of the 20th century, particularly by the Copenhagen interpretation. What is real does seem to depend on us and our method of questioning nature. As the physicist E. P. Wigner has claimed, a measurement cannot legitimately be said to have taken place until it is acknowledged by the conscious awareness of a human being. Far from being a secondary reality, consciousness has a much greater significance in quantum theory. We confront the world with the filters of our human thoughts about the world, and nature conforms to these thoughts to some extent. A reality becomes manifest based upon the thoughts behind one of our experiments. We do not measure reality as Newton and all classical physicists believed; we measure the \"relationship\" between reality and our thoughts.\nIn the quantum realm we cannot pin down a consistent reality, and nature teaches us in the process not to take our thoughts about reality too seriously, on the one hand, and to take them very seriously, on the other hand. We should not think of our human concepts of \"particle\" and \"wave\" as reflecting an independent reality, but we have been forced to recognize the creative power of human concepts. The mathematics of quantum theory pictures not a precise clock with definite parts but a strange indefinite cosmic substance capable of manifesting an infinite number of fleeting faces. Quantum theory pictures the particles that make up everything that we touch and feel not as little, hard, definite, independent things, but as a tangle of possibilities entangled with every other tangle of possibilities throughout the universe. As with the particles in the Aspect experiment, the particles in my body may be connected in some way with the particles of your body, and these in turn with particles in a distant sun, in a distant galaxy, billions of light-years away.\n\"All things will be in everything; nor is it possible for them to be apart, but all things have a portion of everything.\"\n- Anaxagoras\nThe results of relativity and quantum theory have sent physicists and philosophers of science scurrying in many different philosophical directions. Although most physicists have accepted the practical dictates of the Copenhagen interpreation, David Bohm, among others, has refused to abandon entirely the realism of Einstein, opting instead for a radical neorealism. For Bohm, the Aspect experiment does not disprove a \"hidden\" reality but only one that consists of separate things. A universe of \"undivided wholeness\" is consistent with all the experimental results. A real universe exists independent of our observations of it, but it is not like the room that I am in now: a bowl of space with apparently independent objects separated into different locations. \"Underneath\", so to speak, from a perspective of a multidimensional hyperspace or superspace, this appearance of separateness can be seen to melt like ink dots in water.\nMathematical equations that literally describe a hyperspace, a multi-dimensional space, which scientists often cryptically refer to as \"configuration\" or \"phase\" space, are common in the mathematics of modern physics. As we have noted, most physicists have been taught during their university educations to think of these as only mathematical devices because it makes no sense to use ordinary language or pictures in an attempt to ascribe a reality to such bizarre number juggling. Bohm, however, following the lead of Einstein, suggests that what works in our equations may point to an underlying reality.\nConsider the following analogy from Bohm's \"Wholeness and the Implicate Order\". Imagine a fishbowl with fish slowly swimming round and round, occasionally darting here and there, changing direction unpredictably. Imagine two TV cameras filming the activity of the fish from different points of view. Imagine finally that in another room a person is sitting watching two TV sets receiving the transmission from the two cameras. This person at first might think that he is watching two different fishbowls and fish movements, except that he would notice an amazing correlation in the movements of the two sets of fish. Every time one of the fish in one TV screen unpredictably changes direction by darting to the left or right, a fish on the other screen changes directions also. After watching this activity for a while, this person should be able to deduce that separate images are different perspectives of one reality. According to Bohm, this is what the long road of scientific endeavor, culminating in the experiments of quantum physics, has revealed to us: Our normal world of separate objects is but separate images of one underlying reality. We set up our three-dimensional experiments and then wonder how particles separated by light-years can be correlated, but from the standpoint of hyperspace the particles are right \"next\" to each other, so to speak; the two apparently spearated particles are the same particle, just as the two apparently separated fish are the same fish.\n\"The various particles have to be taken literally as projections of a higher-dimensional reality which cannot be accounted for in terms of any force of interaction between them.\"\n- David Bohm\nWe can get an idea of what existence in a higher dimension is like by comparing our three-dimensional existence with a hypothetical two-dimensional existence called Flat Land. Imagine a world that is flat like a piece of cardboard upon which flat, two-dimensional creatures live. Imagine that on this world there are flat, two-dimensional houses and flat, two-dimensional creatures that look like triangles, squares and circles. Because they are two-dimensional, these peculiar characters can go about their two-dimensional business by moving forward or backward and left or right, but \"up\" and \"down\" have no meaning in this world. Relative to this world, we would find that three-dimensional creatures like ourselves have supernatural powers. We could peer into their houses from above and watch what they are doing; we could cause strange events to happen at great distances simultaneously; we could cause correlated behavior in objects that seem separated to our flatlanders. We could even cause strange objects to appear out of nowhere.\nSuppose we picked up an ordinary salad fork from our three-dimensional world and poked it in and out of this two-dimensional world. A flatland creature observing this event from his two-dimensional world would see only four mysterious dots appear from nowhere, move around in a coordinated manner, and then vanish as mysteriously as they appeared. If we pikced up one of these two-dimensional creatures and pulled him up into our three-dimensional world, then he would have a mystical experience; he would experience a reality for which he has no language to describe. If we then placed him back onto his two-dimensional world, perhaps where a number of his friends are discussing his mysterious disappearance, he would appear to them to materialize out of nowhere. If he attempted to explain to his friends what he had experienced, then he would undoubtedly sound like a crazy fool.\nAccording to Bohm, our observations of electrons and other subatomic phenomena in our three-dimensional laboratories with three-dimensional equipment are not the result of an act of creation of consciousness, but rather an interfacing of a multidimensional reality with a three-dimensional one. Just as our flatlanders experienced mysterious, unpredictable events that were explainable from the point of view of another dimension, so the behavior of electrons and other subatomic phenomena are understandable from the point of view of an overlaying, but concealed, \"implicate\" hyperspace. Just as the actions of the four correlated dots produced by the three-dimensional fork are seen to be one reality, so our entire world of apparent separated particles that seem to make up separate objects is but a manifestation of one undivided hyperspatial whole.\nThe major virtue of such an interpretation of the mathematics and experimental results of quantum physics is that the realism of our normal three-dimensional world is preserved. When we walk out of a room, the room is still \"there\" in a sense. From a hyperspatial perspective, more than a three-dimensional room may be there, but the three-dimensional room is still there for any three-dimensional creature to see. We do not create the room from nothingness.\n\"By the act of observation we have selected a 'real' history out of the many realities, and once someone has seen a tree in our world it stays there even when nobody is looking at it.\"\n- John Gribbin\nThere is no logical necessity for believing in one universe any more than there is for believing that Earth is the center of existence. Another interpretation of quantum physics is known as the Many Worlds interpretation. This interpretation preserves Einstein's realism with a vengeance. In the 1950s Hugh Everett III, then a graduate student at Princeton University, decided to see what would happen if the mathematical equations of quantum physics were consistently taken literally. To see how this would work, let's return to our previous experiment.\nRecall the experiment attempting to prove that single particles of light pass through only one channel (Figure 2-a). Our result of detecting only one whole unit of energy at detector A or B was consistent with this interpretation. This interpretation was not, however, consistent with the outcome of the experiment with totally reflecting mirrors replacing detectors A and B. The Schrodinger equation depicts waves of some sort passing through both channels, and the experiment with totally reflecting mirrors demonstrates that light, as a wave that splits into two waves, is in both channels. According to the Many Worlds interpretation, there is a simple, but shocking, explanation for the final result. The Schrodinger equation depicts the radiation in both channels as real; the reason we only observe it at one detector or the other is because when a measurement is made, the world splits into two equally real worlds! When the radiation is detected at A, it has also been detected at B. We do not detect it at B because B is an event taking place in another world.\nAccording to this interpretation, all the possibilities delineated by the Schrodinger equation are real. In making an observation of a particular possibility, we are not collapsing a wave packet or creating a reality from a number of possibilities. Rather, like a road with many forks, we are choosing a world to travel on from many possible worlds. All the alternate worlds are paths in hyperspace; there are equally real, but we are forever cut off from them. In every observation we are choosing a branch of reality. If the Copenhagen interpretation implies that nothing is real independent of observation, then the Many Worlds interpretation implies that everything is real. We do not create a universe with an act of observation; we choose a universe that is already there as a possible path.\nIn the two-slit experiment, when an attempt is made to see if the photons are passing through both slits (Figure 1-c), we found the radiation passing through only one slit or the other. According to John Gribbin, in his book \"In Search of Schrodinger's Cat\", here is the proper interpretation of what the electron is doing:\nFaced with a choice at the quantum level, not only the particle itself but the entire universe splits into two versions. In one universe, the particle goes through [one hole], in the other it goes through [the other hole]. In each universe there is an observer who sees the particle go through just one hole. And forever afterward the two universes are completely separate and noninteracting, which is why there is no interference on the screen of the experiment.\nThis means, however, that just as there are many routes to the future, there are many versions of \"us\" that will follow these paths. Because every observation split the path we are on into alternate universes again and again, there are literally billions of alternate paths through hyperspace. These alternate worlds, however, are not parallel to us, as in so much science fiction, but like our three-dimensional view of two-dimensional Flat Land, there are at right angles. Somewhere in this hyperspace is a world where the South won the American Civil War [Harry Turtledove's alternate history \"The Guns of the South\" explores this possibility], a world where the Spanish Armada defeated the British, a world where John F. Kennedy was not assassinated, and a world where World War III has happened and the human species is extinct. You might take a rest here and contemplate the implications of this interpretation. While you are at it, also contemplate the fact that human beings can think such thoughts and that some physicists take this interpretation very seriously as the only way out of quantum paradoxes. There are no limits to our gestures of understanding with the universe.\n\"Physics, too, is only an interpretation of the universe, an arrangement of it (to suit us, if I may be so bold!), rather than a clarification.\"\n- Friedrich Nietzsche\nAs a paradigm for our time, some scientists have found it less shocking to carry out the implications of the Copenhagen interpretation than to believe that each moment we are splitting into 10 to the 100th equally real copies of ourselves. John Wheeler, a distinguished American physicst, has argued that we must abandon the basic tenet of traditional realism--that the universe is in some sense sitting out there for us to uncover. In its place, according to Wheeler, we must boldly embrace the concept of a \"participatory universe\". (However, Wheeler has been highly critical of those who would use this abandonment of realism as an excuse for believing in the occult or mysticism. See the next section.)\nAdherents of this view claim that all vestiges of traditional realism must be abandoned. There is no clocklike world in any sense sitting out there for our observational benefit alone. We do not observe \"the real world\"; we participate with reality by creating a reality for us. More precisely, we do not create reality; we select a concrete reality from out of an intermingled dance of intangible possibilities. (In the Many Worlds interpretation, all the possibilities are concrete.)\nThis concept is not as difficult to understand as it may seem. Wherever you are right now there are many hidden, potential manifestations of energy that all of us have come to take for granted int the 20th century. There are many potential channels of electromagnetic information. Although we cannot see them or feel them, there are many AM, FM and TV signals passing by us at any given moent. They are both here and not here. To make these signals of information manifest, to make them concrete, we must \"tune them in\"; we must have a device such as a radio or TV set to collapse the indefinite electromagnetic waves into concrete electronic digits of information. The human mind is like a radio receiver stuck on one channel. when we set up our three-dimensional laboratory equipment, when we peer into our high-tech telescopes and see galaxies millions of light years away, we participate with the infinite by manifesting one of its faces. It is not a mask; it is definitely there. But only when we observe it; just as radio music is music only when we tune it in.\nOur confrontation with the microcosmos has taught us this: The results of our experiments are due to our being on one channel, but the microcosmos is kind enough to reveal to us, through mathematics and observational paradoxes, that there are many other channels. It has taught us that when we go out on a crisp, clear night and peer through a pair of binoculars at the Andromeda galaxy and receive the light that in our normal mode of thinking is 2 million years old, we are instantly creating a 2-million-year-old past. The universe, in a sense, is here because we are here. But we should not get too uppity about this; the universe will do just fine without us. There is still a kind of a past even if I am not looking, just as there is potential music in my room, even if my radio is off.\nMysticism and the Convergence Thesis\n\"For if those who hold that there must be a physical basis for everything hold that these mystical views are nonsense, we may ask--What then is the physical basis of nonsense? ... In a world of ether and electrons we might perhaps encounter nonsense; we could not encounter damned nonsense.\"\n- Arthur Eddington\nOne more interpretation of quantum physics deserves some comment. It is a very controversial interpretation, in part because it has attracted a faddish and cultlike following, which claims that the results of modern science have validated a particular religious orientation. The possibility of such a development is one of the reasons scientists are often reluctant to communicate with the general public. An idea, however, cannot be responsible for its misuse by uncritical followers, and the misuse of an idea does not prove the idea false.\nFor purposes of identification let's refer to this final interpretation as the convergence thesis. Essentially, this view argues that our confrontation with the quantum has demonstrated that Western science, founded upon logic and philosophy of the ancient Greeks, has, after traveling a much different philosophical path, converged with the philosophy of the East, especially the mystical philosophies of Hinduism and Buddhism. This view was popularized in the 1970s by Fritjof Capra in \"The Tao of Physics\" and by Gary Zukav in \"The Dancing Wu Li Masters\". According to Capra, \"What Buddhists have realized through their mystical experience of nature has now been rediscovered through the experiments and mathematical theories of modern science.\" Zukov says, \"Hindu mythology is virtually a large scale porjection into the psychological realm of microscopic scientific discoveries.\"\nFor many thousands of years, it is argued, the mystics have had a cosmological and epistemological view of things that the Western world is just beginning to understand. Cosmologically, Western science has understood only recently that the universe is extremely old. In 1965 the temperature of the universe was measured for the first time, resulting in our present estimate of the age of the universe as 15 billion years old. In the ancient literature of the East one does not, of course, find such precise figures. Instead there are analogies such as the following. Imagine an immortal eagle flying over the Himalayas only once every 1,000 years; it carries a feather in its beak and each time it passes, it lightly brushes the tops of the gigantic mountain peaks. The amount of time it would take the eagle to completely erode the mighty Himalayas is said to be the age of the present manifestation of the universe. Such a conception of time, which predates modern science by thousands of years, is thought to be remarkable, especially when it is compared to the slow realization of Western science and religion to the possibility of a less humanlike time scale.\nEastern mysticism is also consistent with the results of quantum physics. The mystics have always rejected the idea of a hidden clocklike mechanism, sitting out there, independent of human observation. The number one truth is that reality does not consist of separate things, but is an indescribable, interconnected oneness. Each object of our normal experience is seen to be but a brief disturbance of a universal ocean of existence. Maya is the illusion that the phenomenal world of separate objects and people is the only reality. For the mystics this manifestation is real, but it is a fleeting reality; it is a mistake, although a natural one, to believe that maya represents a fundamental reality. Each person, each physical object, from the perspective of eternity is like a brief, disturbed drop of water from an unbounded ocean. The goal of enlightenment is to understand this--more precisely, to experience this: to see intuitively that the distinction between me and the universe is a false dichotomy. The distinction between consciousness and physical matter, between mind and body, is the result of an unenlightened perspective.\nEpistemologically, our so-called knowledge of the world is actually only a projection or creation of thoughts. Reality is ambiguous. It requires thoughts for distinctions to become manifest. We have seen that in the realm of the quantum, dynamic particle attributes such as \"spin\", \"location\", and \"velocity\" are best thought of as relational or phenomenal realities. It is a mistake to think of these properties as sitting out there; rather, they are the result of experimental arrangements and ultimately the thoughts of the experimenters. Quantum particles have a partial appearance of individuality, but experiments show that the true nature of the quantum lies beyond description in human terms. Our filters produce the manifestations we see, and the result is just incomplete enough to point to another kind of reality, an ambiguous reality of \"not this, not that\".\nFor the mystic, the paradoxes of quantum physics are just another symptom of humankind's attempt to describe what can only be experienced. We are like a man with a torch surrounded by darkness. The man wants to experience the darkness, but keeps running senselesslly at the darkness with his torch still in hand. He does not realize that he must drop the torch and plunge into the darkness. The proliferation of philosophical interpretations of quantum physics is a symptom of the shipwreck of a traditional Western way of understanding, of our inability to \"let go\" of our Western torch--our traditional logic and epistemology. It is also a symptom of our inability to let go of our egocentricity, our persistent attempt to define everything in purely human terms, as if we were somehow special and separate from the rest of the universe. Like a nervous, self-centered teenager at a party, concerned only with what others think of him or her, our entire field of vision and understanding is narrowly defined in terms of \"me\". Because of our fear of letting go, we are missing much that is right in front of us.\nAccording to this interpretation, the mathematics is complete just as it is. What the Schrodinger equation depicts for microscopic objects is also true for any macroscopic object. The universe is not full of separate objects, people and places. Rather, it is an unbounded field of entangled possibilities. Because of the level of our conscious awareness, we fail to realize that duality, ambiguity and interdependence are the rule rather than the exception. Mathematics may be one of the closest ways we can come to representing this in terms of a human language. All languages, however, are ultimately inadequate. Myths, stories, analogies, pictures, mathematical equations--all such symbol systems can just point to what can only be fully understood through a visionary experience.\nIn the episode entitled \"The Edge of Forever\" in the \"Cosmos\" television series, Carl Sagan visits India, and by way of introducing some of the bizarre ideas of modern physics, he acknowledges that of all the world's philosophies and religions those originating in India are remarkably consistent with contemporary scenarios of space, time and existence. However, adamantly skeptical of the knowledge value of a nonrational mystical intuition, he concludes that although these religious ideas are worthy of our deep respect, this is obviously a \"coincidence\". Using natural selection as a model, Sagan proposes that this consistency is \"no doubt an accident\" because given enough time and possible proposals, given enough creative responses to the great mystery of existence, some ideas will fit the truth just right.\nOther critics of the convergence thesis have not been as charitable. They argue that it is just plain silly to interpret an ancient belief system, founded upon certain psychological needs and within a historical context, in terms of any modern perspective. It is obvious, they argue, how the Hindu and Buddhist beliefs could soothe people living under extreme conditions. If our day-to-day reality is but a fleeting manifestation, then the vicious misfortune and meaningless suffering of this world are not real. For these critics, the methodology of psychological need as an origin of these ideas implies there is no connection. By revealing the obvious psychological motivation for a set of beliefs, it is argued, one can question the truth of these beliefs. To further suggest that there is any connection between these beliefs and the results of rigorous experimental science is ludicrous.\nBoth of these arguments are flawed. If the ideas of Hinduism and Buddhism are simply the result of a lot of guessing, and the serendipitous contingency of evolutionary processes the appropriate model, then shouldn't all the guessing that takes place over time be consistent with a macroscopic environment, not a microscopic environment with which a primitive people have no experience? And even if it is true that a belief system serves a set of psychological needs, does this prove the belief system false? Many scientists are also surely motivated for many reasons to hold the beliefs they do: a philosophical perspective, the need for certainty, or the need for security (be it a government grant or tenure at a prestigious university). That scientists have biases and motivations to believe what they do does not prove that what they finally believe is false.\nBoth of these arguments, however, do reveal a sobering point. The philosophical consistency between Hinduism and Buddhism and the results of modern science does not prove much by itself. Historically, we have seen many instances of a philosophy or a religious view being consistent with the science of a time, and a consequent rush to claim that the new science validates a relgion or a philosophy. For both Copernicus and Kepler, the heliocentric system of the planets was consistent with their Neoplatonism and the idea that the sun was the \"material domicile\" of God. Similarly, for Bruno the heliocentric system was consistent with a larger universe and a greater God. For Newton a universe based upon the laws of universal gravitation was consistent with a conception of God as a master craftsman, a creater of an almost perfect machine who left a few defects to give Himself something to do. For some of the initial supporters of Darwin, natural selection was interpreted as a vindication of a philosophy of inevitable progress based upon a capitalistic economic system.\nPerhaps the more pertinent question, applicable to all the interpretations of quantum physics, is not which offered paradigm is the truth, but which one will give us the most mileage? Which one, if followed as a guide, will be the most fruitful in stimulation the imagination of the next generation of scientists in devising new ideas, mathematical relationshiops, and experiments? In this reading we have not given much attention to the area of modern physics that recently has gotten the most notoriety. Most physicsts, concerned with the daily demands of obtaining research grants and Nobel Prizes, have simply filed such demonstrations away and continued with the Einsteinian quest, searching for more and more exotic particles, new \"things\" that will prove the supersymmetry theories, unifying all the known forces of nature and catapulting our understanding to the first microseconds of the universe and perhaps beyond.\nYet in spite of Nobel Prizes for the discovery of some of these new particles and public pronouncements that the end of the Einsteinian quest is near, one senses that all is not well with this approach. Physicists themselves complain that the proliferation of particles necessary to explain everything is too complex to be consistent with a simple universe. One senses many ad hoc approaches and a situation not unlike followers of Ptolemy adding epicycle after epicycle to make the data fit. Some experiments reveal serious anomalies. Particles that allegedly consist of a \"bag\" of quarks are not supposed to pass through each other, but in some cases, if the spins are just right, they do! One senses that nature is not yet ready to succumb completely to our lates gestures of understanding.\nEvery past success at understanding has produced new mysteries. Why should it be any different now? Perhaps the results of quantum physics discussed in this chapter are revealing to us a great discovery after all. This great partner we call the universe is not a static personality, but grows and is formed by us, as we are by it. There is every reason to believe that our romance will continue, that there are many mysteries left for a new generation of physicists. Although there have been many pretenders since the time of Kepler, no one has yet read the mind of God.\nConcept Summary\n\"I believe that certain erroneous developments in particle theory ... are caused by a misconception by some physicists that it is possible to avoid philsophical arguments altogether. Starting with poor philosophy, they pose the wrong questions. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that good physics has at times been spoiled by poor philosophy.\"\n- Werner Heisenberg\nOne of the major scientific questions of this century seems so simple. What are electrons, photons, and other subatomic objects that have made the amazing technological revolution of this century possible? After more than 70 years of asking this question, no consensus on an answer has been reached, and widely divergent views on the nature of reality and the role of science in dealing with reality have resulted. Experiments with subatomic phenomena show effects that are difficult to reconcile with our normal view of an objective world. Particles of matter are independent objects located in one place at a time. Waves can spread out and/or split and be in many places at the same time. All experiments with subatomic phenomena show wave-particle duality; rather than a definitive, objective world, reality seems to be ambiguous at the quantum level.\nAlthough a very successful mathematics was developed enabling physicsts to interact with, explore, and extend applications of subatomic reality, the interpretation of the mathematics is a philosophical muddle. One of the most influential interpretations of quantum physics was that of Niels Bohr and what has come to be called the Copenhagen Interpretation. According to this interpretation, the ambiguity and complementarity of quantum experimentation reveal a startlingly pragmatic, epistemological discovery: Our macroscopic experiments must be conducted from the point of view of a human conceptual reference frame, but nature at the quantum level need not, and apparently does not, conform to macroscopic concepts. Accordingly, what we measure in our quantum experiments are the results of our relationship with nature, not nature itself. Between moments of preparation and measurement of quantum events, there is nothing definitive to know, understand, or measure, because nature has revealed to us that there is nothing there that can be conceptualized in human terms. Subatomic phenomena such as photons and electrons become definitive objects only after measurements are made with macroscopic equipment.\nBecause Einstein was convinced that the goal of science is to reveal the clockwork mechanism of nature itself, not just the probabilistic results of our relationship or experimental tinkering with nature, he objected to this interpretation. Quantum theory could not be a complete theory. For Einstein there was an underlying reality that we did not understand yet; for Bohr, the goal of knowing an underlying, definitive reality was an antiquated philosophical relic of classical physics. For Einstein, the Copenhagen Interpretation implied defeatism at its best and classical idealism at its worst. For Bohr, many fruitful explorations still exist, relationships yet to be described and mathematical trails yet to be followed, but the search for a \"hidden\" reality will not be one of them.\nThe work of Bell and Aspect has resulted in a strong experimental confirmation that in the quantum realm it is wrong to think of quantum phenomena as independent hidden entities influenced by independent local circumstances. Like Newton confronting the problem of gravity, most physicists in the 20th century have been trained to adopt a pragmatic or instrumentalist stance to these results--science is supposed to describe the objective properties of experiments, not speculate on a hidden reality between measurements. But the compelling need for a philosophical understanding has produced numerous proposals.\nSome physicists have argued that the success of quantum theory shows that far from being a secondary quality, consciousness produces a definitive, relationship-reality from an ambiguous, featureless whole. David Bohm has suggested that an interpretation of radical neorealism is still possible, one that describes a multidimensional hyperspace of implicative wholeness \"behind\" the explicative or definitive reality of our common-sense world. Others have argued that a rigorous interpretation of the mathematics of quantum theory reveals that the divergent results of interactions with the quantum realm can be explained in terms of real, branching, or splitting universes.\nStill others have claimed that we must abandon traditional realism altogether. The world cannot be pictured as \"sitting out there\" for us to uncover; our \"participation\" with an intermingled dance of possibilities yields a concrete reality. Finally, some have claimed that quantum theory represents a convergence of Western and Eastern philsophies; modern science has uncovered the same indescribable, interconnected oneness discussed by mystics for centuries. For the mystic the result of quantum experiment is like a man with a torch surrounded by darkness. The man wants to experience the darkness, but keeps running senselessly at the darkness with his torch still in hand. Most scientists believe this is total nonsense.\nOne thing seems clear. There are plenty of mysteries left to stimulate the next generation of physicists.\nReturn to the Astronomical Teaching Archives page.\n"}, {"score": 2317.943, "uuid": "33c51455-2df2-54ae-933b-9e34dc1072c6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0011wb-60-17813", "target_hostname": "unfspb.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://unfspb.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/logical-positivism-and-the-copenhagen-interpretation/", "page_rank": 1.248872e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Logical Positivism <em>and</em> <em>the</em> Copenhagen Interpretation of <em>Quantum</em> <em>Mechanics</em>", "snippet": "<em>What</em> resulted was <em>what</em> <em>is</em> known today as <em>the</em> Copenhagen Interpretation of <em>quantum</em> <em>mechanics</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Logical Positivism and the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum\u00a0Mechanics\nJuly 12, 2011 by Aaron\nBefore continuing, I should offer the following caveat. What is to follow is a very rough draft of a paper I threw together. The paper was inspired by another I authored on a similar theme for a PoS class. The following neglects many details and instead provides for a rough outline of a larger, much closer analyzed and ambitious paper I suspect I will write in the near future. So, this post is but an approximation of what is to come. Nevertheless, if the post engenders discussion on any topics pertaining to quantum mechanics, scientific methodology, philosophy of science, verificationism, logical positivism, whatever, and attracts critical first assessments, then it will have served its purpose.\nLogical Positivism and the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics\n\u201cThe rise of quantum theory in the years 1900 to 1927 is surely one of the major advances in the history of science- perhaps even one of the greatest intellectual advances ever made by mankind\u201d (Hund 1974, p. 5). The mathematical formulation of modern quantum mechanics consists of a complete and logically consistent framework of mathematical deductions (see, for instance, von Neumann 1955). However, an ordered series of mathematical deductions, no matter how complete or logically consistent, is not a physical theory. In order to obtain the status of a physical theory, the mathematical formalism or, more precisely, the mathematical representations, must be assigned certain, specifiable experimental conditions so as to allow for the determination of measurement procedures which may aid in the confirmation and disconfirmation of hypotheses and in the identification of new and fruitful avenues of investigation. Of course, the experimental data produced by the measurement procedures necessitate interpretation, and that interpretation will run up through the mathematical structure resulting in our view of the theory and its overall implications for our system of the world.\nThe most popular interpretation of quantum mechanics among physicists today is the Copenhagen Interpretation [CI] (Tegmark 1998)1. The CI formed gradually in 1920s in Copenhagen, Denmark, through the work of Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, John von Neumann, and others (Cushing 1994; Heisenberg 1958; Jammer 1974). Contemporaneous to the development of the CI was the development of logical positivism, as represented by the Vienna and Berlin Circles2. Logical positivism, it has been commonly argued, is a philosophically dead programme (see, for instance, Passmore 1967, pp. 52 \u2013 57). However, as recent trends in post-Kuhnian philosophy of science indicate, logical positivism remains a profitable philosophical enterprise. One reason for holding to the continuing value of logical positivism is the influence verificationism had on the formulation of the CI. More precisely, Niels Bohr, the primary architect of the CI, was himself influenced by logical positivism, as seen in his response- discussed below- to Einstein\u2019s criticisms to the probabilistic nature of the CI. In the end, the success of the CI may be seen as a practical justification of a general and broad verificationist epistemology. Moreover, insofar as logical positivism rejects realism concerning scientific theories and the CI is an instrumentalist interpretation of quantum mechanics, an ancillary conclusion will be that some form of the scientific anti-realist view of instrumentalism remains a viable position on scientific theories.\nLogical Positivism\nTo speak of a single logical positivist programme is inaccurate. Logical positivism is a more or less loose collection of philosophical theses- some of which are incompatible- which have their genesis in the scientific inclinations of the Vienna Circle members (on this see Friedman 1999 and Uebel 2009). However, one may identify two broadly unifying themes within logical positivism: (1) a verificationist epistemology and (2) an instrumentalist stance toward scientific theories.\nThe naive definition of verificationism may be stated as follows: a statement is meaningful if and only if it is verifiable. First, as formulated, this definition is too simple and subject to a much too easy criticism: In order to verify or falsify a statement, it seems that one must already know what that statement means. Second, \u201cmeaningful\u201d and \u201cverifiable\u201d are ambiguous, and it is not at all clear in what sense the logical positivists intended to use the terms. Furthermore, even when the logical positivists avoid the simple criticism above by disambiguating \u201cmeaning\u201d and \u201cverification\u201d (see, for instance, Pap 1962, pp. 6 \u2013 37; Carnap 1936; Ayer 1946, Introduction to the 2nd edition; Dummett 1992, pp. 129 \u2013 156), further, more intractable difficulties remain (Hempel 1959, pp. 108 \u2013 129). While for our purposes we may forgo consideration of the problems of verificationism and their proposed solutions, it is prudent to state a more acceptable, albeit imprecise definition of verificationism: a sentence is meaningful if and only if it is truth-apt; a sentence is truth-apt if and only if it is verifiable; and a sentence is verifiable if and only if it is capable, in principle, of experiential test, whether via direct observation or through some indirect measurement procedure(s).\nIn other words, let us suppose the meaningfulness of a sentence is under consideration. Following William James, we must inquire \u2018\u2018what concrete differences will its being true [or false] make in any one\u2019s actual life? What experiences [may] be different from those which would obtain if the belief were false? How will the truth be realized? What, in short, is the truth\u2019s cash-value in experiential terms\u201d (James 1907, p. 200-201)? In other words, the desire is for broad, intersubjective observable criteria for the application and truth assessment of sentences. If a sentence fails to establish in the analysis intersubjective observable criteria- or bridging hypotheses which tie the sentence to observable criteria-, then the sentence is not truth-apt, and thus not meaningful.\nIn general, verificationsim led to the identification and rejection of so-called metaphysical statements. In particular, verificationism led to the dissolution of perennial philosophical problems such as the problem of the external world. Here logical positivists took two approaches. The first approach, which A.J. Ayer (1946) and early Rudolf Carnap (1959, pp. 60 \u2013 81) adopted, reduced talk of the reality of objects to talk of sense-data, from which physical objects are a logical construction. The other approach, which Otto Neurath (Cat 2009) and later Carnap adopted, is to reduce talk of the reality of objects to talk of physicalism, that is, that rather than sense-data, what we experience is physical objects. A bridge between these two approaches may be seen in Moritz Schlick (1959, pp. 82 \u2013 107), who reduced talk of \u201creality\u201d to talk of observation as such. That is, we may speak of objects as real if by \u201creal\u201d we mean \u201cobservable\u201d or, broadly, detectable in some measurement or observation procedure. In other words, we may simply translate \u201creal\u201d as \u201cobserved\u201d or \u201cobservable.\u201d Whichever approach one takes3, I think Schlick\u2019s position is basically correct: We may say that which is real is that which is observable, and conclude that talk of things-in-themselves or substances in which our experiences inhere, e.g., is entirely unnecessary. Nevertheless, for the positivists verificationism is the preeminent guide to scientific methodology- whether one construes to observe physical objects or sense-data- and determines the adoption of scientific theories. The adoption of a scientific theory, then, is not a matter of truth or the elucidation of fundamental reality, but rather a matter of instrumental utility. It is a matter of framing hypotheses which imply past observations and which predict future observations under specifiable conditions, which in turn serve to confirm or disconfirm these hypotheses. That is to say, one theory is better than another to the extent that it is more fruitful in suggesting empirical generalizations under which we may subsume an ever expanding spectrum of phenomena and in aiding in the formulation of further predictive hypotheses.\nThe Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics\nThe origin of quantum theory began with the inability of classical physics to account for the observed energy spectrum of black body radiation and the experimental data which confirmed the atomic theory of matter (Jammer 1966). Through the work of Max Planck and Albert Einstein in the early 1900s, it soon became productive to understand light as consisting of discrete packets of energy, photons, which in collision with electrons produced energy radiation (the observed light spectra of heated bodies). Subsequent experimental data revealed an ever more complex subatomic world. From 1913 with the publication of Niels Bohr\u2019s mathematical model of the hydrogen atom and improvements to it through the work of Arnold Sommerfeld and Werner Heisenberg and many others, including Paul Dirac, Max Born, Louis de Broglie, Erwin Schrodinger, and John von Neumann, to name only a few, the basic mathematical structure that we have today of quantum mechanics was formed (Fong 1962; Omnes 1999; Cushing 1994). The problem remained, however: How ought we to interpret the body of experimental data and mathematical formalisms?\nFrom October 24th to the 29th in 1927 the Fifth Solvay Congress took place. In attendance were the greatest names in physics at the time: Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Max Planck, Henry Lorentz, Wolfgang Pauli, Erwin Schrodinger, Niels Bohr, Max Born, and Werner Heisenberg (not a complete list). The official program of the Solvay Congress was \u201cElectrons and Photons,\u201d but the participants soon realized that this meeting would set the stage for a definitive discussion regarding the interpretation of the new quantum mechanics (Jammer 1974).\nThe debate (known as the Bohr-Einstein debate) that ensued consisted of two principal factions: the realists and the anti-realists, represented by Einstein and Bohr, respectively. Initially, as Max Jammer writes, \u201cBohr cherished the hope that the positivistic element in the complementarity interpretation would make Einstein change his mind\u201d (1974, p. 109). However, unbeknownst to Bohr and his colleagues, Einstein since turned away from his earlier Machian influences and adopted a more realist position (Frank 1947, p. 215). In fact, the realists were of the opinion that in principle Bohr and his colleagues were gravely mistaken and that a series of thought experiments would elucidate the mistake. The expectations for success on both sides were palpable.\n[More here to come.]\nAfter the conference, and after Einstein\u2019s criticisms were answered in detail by Bohr, much to Einstein\u2019s chagrin, Bohr\u2019s interpretation was deemed the most plausible in light of the experimental evidence (Cushing 1994). What resulted was what is known today as the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics. While to identify a single CI may in fact be a mistake4, one may identify three theses which form the central core of any CI (Heisenberg 1958; Cushing 1994; Hund 1974; Jammer 1974):\n(1) The wave function is a complete description of the wave/particle duality. That is, the wave function establishes completely the possible information available from which to predict quantum phenomena.\n(2) When a measurement procedure is conducted, the wave function collapses. That is, quantum particles are assigned classical values when (and only when) a measurement procedure is performed. For example, before a measurement is performed, a particle\u2019s position is indeterminate and is constrained by the statistical wave function within a given space. After a measurement is performed, the possibilities of the particle\u2019s position collapses and we may assign a definite value within specifiable, experimentally determined margins of error.\n(3) Indeterminacy. If one measures one value, then one cannot measure another value with any measurable degree of accuracy. That is, there exists an uncertainty relationship between classical values, such as position and velocity, in quantum mechanical systems.\nEPR and Bohr\u2019s Response\n(1) \u2013 (3) entail the violation of heretofore deeply established scientific principles of determinacy, which for many is unacceptable. For example, Einstein and his colleagues believed that nature operated according to deterministic processes, and if one could not predict an outcome with a measurable degree of accuracy, then it is because of a lack of knowledge, not because of the nature of the physical processes themselves. In order to emphasize the criticism, Einstein and fellow physicists, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, published a paper (hereafter EPR) wherein, through a detailed thought experiment, they sought to show either that measurements in one quantum system affect measurements in another or that the wave function is not complete, which is to say either (3) or (1), and by implication (2), above is incorrect.\nIn nuce, the argument in EPR is as follows. Einstein begins his thought experiment by assuming locality (the thesis that there is no action at a distance). He then assumes that system S1 at previous time t interacted with system S2. Einstein continues that via a measurement of S1 one may assign a state vector \u03f4 or \u0404 (but not both) to observables in S2 without physically interfering with S2. Therefore, S2 is either in the same physical state as S1 at t whether we assign \u03f4 or \u0404 to it or S2 is in a different state. If the latter, then the physical state of S2 at t is dependent upon the physical state of S1 at t. If the former, then since one can describe similar physical states with \u03f4 or \u0404, then \u03f4 or \u0404 cannot be a complete description of that physical state; that is, we must be able to assign other hidden values which discriminate between similar physical states. In either case, either the wave function which describes S1 and S2 is incomplete or locality is violated, which relativity entails is impossible (Einstein, et al., 1935, pp. 770 \u2013 780).\n[Expound upon locality / non-locality here.]\nBohr\u2019s response to EPR evinces his positivistic influences. In \u201cCan Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?\u201d (1935), Bohr argues that Einstein\u2019s assumption that S2 was in the same physical state at t- irrespective of whether it was assigned \u03f4 or \u0404- is meaningless. The ascription of a physical state may occur only within the context of the total experimental data. In Einstein\u2019s thought experiment the experimental context included data concerning S1 and S2, in which case measurements of S1 can affect S2, and vice versa. Moreover, Bohr\u2019s response to Einstein entails non-locality, which Einstein assumes is impossible. For Bohr, to speak of a physical state and state vectors which describe that state is meaningless outside of the measurement procedures used to assign state vectors to observables. However plausible Einstein\u2019s initial assumptions may at first blush appear, Einstein\u2019s argument begs the question in the assumption of locality and the existence of hidden variables. In fact, in 1964, Bohr\u2019s response was confirmed by the physicist John Bell in a series of experiments wherein he assumed a locality assumption similar to Einstein\u2019s and showed that such an assumption in fact restricts the probabilities for the measurement outcomes and that the experimentally confirmed probabilities of specified quantum physical systems violate Einstein\u2019s assumptions.\nLogical Positivism and Niels Bohr\nBohr\u2019s response to EPR (and his responses to Einstein\u2019s criticisms during the 1927 Solvay Congress) reveals an overt positivistic influence. Many scholars have discussed the influence of the logical positivists on Bohr\u2019s (and Heisenberg\u2019s) scientific understanding (see, for instance, Jammer 1974; Beller 1999; Cushing 1994, pp. 28, 29). However, other scholars have noted that Bohr\u2019s philosophical influences were rather more varied (see, for instance, Petersen 1968; Folse 1985; Jammer 1966, pp. 166 \u2013 180). An honest assessment of the relevant historical evidence, however, reveals multiple lines of philosophical influence. Nevertheless, enough evidence exists to warrant the conclusion that Bohr was rather heavily influenced by logical positivism, in particular verificationism.\nIn June 1936, from the 21st to the 26th, Bohr hosted the 2nd International Congress for the Unity of Science in Copenhagen at his honorary mansion in Carlsberg (Faye 2008). In attendance was Otto Neurath, C.G. Hempel, Karl Popper, Phillip Frank, Jorgen Jorgensen, the leading expositor of logical positivism in Denmark at the time, and other Danish scientists and philosophers who were sympathetic to the positivist program. Faye reports that Hans Reichenbach, Moritz Schlick, and Rudolf Carnap also expressed a desire to attend (indeed, a paper of Schlick\u2019s was read at the conference), but were for various reasons unable.\nBohr also had other interactions with logical positivists before the 1936 conference. Two years prior Jorgensen gave six lectures on epistemology, two of which Bohr attended. At the conference was Neurath, who would later write to Carnap (Faye 2008, p. 4):\n\u201cBohr. Idiosyncratic. An intense man. Came to two lectures and joined the discussion enthusiastically \u2026 Basic line: he does not want to be considered a metaphysician. And he is able to express himself relatively non-metaphysically, when he is careful. Yet obviously there lies a certain tendency in the selection of problems, insofar as the question of life, etc. is discussed, as well as in the stress on uncertainty. In addition, his printed remarks are full of crass metaphysics. But he possesses certain basic attitudes which agree with mine, e.g., that in science one cannot clear up everything at once, but that the individual scientific-logical actions have to pay a price, as it were. An idea of compensation, which with him naturally tends to be connected with the uncertainty relation. Obviously tries to come into agreement with us. But since his circle confirms him in his habit to express himself somewhat unclearly, one would have to be able to work on him for a long time, which he would be prepared to do.\u201d\nObviously, Neurath found much in common with Bohr. In fact, after the lectures Bohr handed Neurath a copy of his Atomic Theory and the Description of Nature along with a letter which apparently stated Bohr\u2019s agreement and common cause with the positivist program (Faye 2008). A striking fact further confirms logical positivism\u2019s influence on Bohr: Prior to 1935 Bohr apparently held that measurements of quantum states disturbed the particles under observation so as to prevent determining precisely state vectors. In other words, Bohr seems to have considered the particles to have had determinate variables before any observation was made of them (Faye 1991). In fact, Faye contends that this stance of Bohr\u2019s may have influenced Einstein\u2019s argument in EPR (Faye 2008, p. 7). Nevertheless, after 1935, and after various exchanges with positivists, Bohr seems to have changed his view on the matter. Perhaps the publication of EPR compelled Bohr to make his position more consistent with the experimental data so that he could respond to Einstein\u2019s criticisms. For in his reply to EPR Bohr was clear when he argued that one could talk meaningfully of a quantum particle only within specifiable measurement procedures. In other words, the measurement procedures determined the conditions under which one could apply values such as position, spin, velocity, etc., thus, in the absence of measurement procedures, in that one talks of hidden variables, one can only be construed as inserting metaphysical presuppositions. Otto Neurath was not the only member of the Vienna Circle with whom Bohr corresponded. In a letter dated January 9, 1936, regarding the Bohr-Einstein debate, Philipp Frank (then professor of physics and philosophy at the University of Prague) informed Bohr that he (Frank) understood Bohr to have expressed a verificationist view of quantum observables while Einstein expressed a realist view and inquired if this was correct. Bohr responded in a letter dated January 14, 1936: \u201cI am very glad to hear from your kind letter that you have given such care to the papers of Einstein and myself concerning the question of reality. I also think that you have caught the sense of my efforts very well\u201d (Faye 2008, p. 9).\nThus, given the evidence gleaned from Bohr\u2019s interactions with Jorgen Jorgensen and members from the Vienna Circle, his response to EPR and, previously, to Einstein at Solvay in 1927, one may conclude that verificationism played an important role in the formation of the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nConclusions\nWhile other philosophical programs besides logical positivism influenced Bohr, notably American pragmatism and the subjectivism of Kierkegaard (Jammer 1966, pp. 166 \u2013 172), verificationism played more than an important role in Bohr\u2019s scientific thinking. Bohr did not hold that quantum mechanics revealed the \u2018fundamental nature of reality\u2019. Rather, he held that quantum theory was a tool with which scientists could order and predict experimental results. For Bohr, then, a distinction between observable and unobservable is to be made. Classical descriptions are made with deterministic state vectors. That is, macroscopic objects (planets or billiard balls, e.g.) maintain deterministic positions and velocities relative to a frame of reference whether or not measurements are performed. In quantum theory, while classical descriptions are retained (see, for instance, Heisenberg 1958)- indeed, must be retained- determinacy is not. Contrary to Einstein (and many others), the CI rejects ascriptions of classical values to unobservables. This is not to say that the CI contends that what is not measured does not exist, to the contrary. To quote Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cke, a student of Niels Bohr: \u201cWhat is observed certainly exists; about what is not observed we are still free to make suitable assumptions. We use that freedom to avoid paradoxes\u201d (1985, p. 82).\n[Need much more here.]\nIn treating unobservables, as von Weizs\u00e4cke\u2019s quote implies, the CI need only ensure the avoidance of contradictory conclusions. For instance, consider the infamous Schrodinger\u2019s cat paradox. In the paradox, a cat is confined to a small metallic box in which lies a chamber containing a radioactive atom. If the atom decays, then a detector will sense the decay and release a poisonous gas which will have the effect of killing the cat. If, as the CI explicitly maintains, quantum actions are uncertain and the state function remains probabilistic on the wave function, then the cat is neither definitely alive nor definitely dead. This, of course, is paradoxical (thus the description of a paradox!) since if the cat were alive, then it would have always remained so, and likewise if the cat were dead, deterministically. That is, it seems that the statistical interpretation of the wave function entails that the cat is both alive and dead. The proponent of the CI need only respond, however, that the wave function represents a probabilistic distribution of all the possible states of a quantum event and our measurement of the event collapses it to a determinate valued. Hence, given the range of possibilities for the cat\u2019s life, it is approximately \u00bd probable that the cat is dead and \u00bd probable that the cat is alive, and when a measurement occurs (in this case, opening the box to look or the reading of the radioactive detector), we will observe either a live cat or a dead cat- never neither, never both.\nThe empirical success of modern quantum theory is unrivaled and the Copenhagen Interpretation has, since its initial formulation, remained widely accepted. Of course, mere popularity does not justify an interpretation. Instead, as the Bohr-Einstain debate and Bohr\u2019s responses (and later Bell\u2019s work) show, the CI satisfies the experimental data and mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics. Bohr\u2019s instrumentalism comports well with the instrumentalism of the logical positivists and the influences of the latter on the former are well-established, and, insofar as Bohr\u2019s instrumentalism shaped and formed the CI, one may conclude that the CI remains a more or less instrumentalist interpretation of quantum mechanics. While verificationism has generally been considered to be hopelessly problematic, insofar as particle physics is concerned, it remains valuable. Hence, insofar as verificationism remains vital to important parts of physics, philosophers of science should reconsider its importance within the philosophy of science in particular and epistemology in general.\n[Not happy with the conclusion; of course, it is a work in progress.]\nEndnotes\n1Although the popularity of the Copenhagen interpretation has declined in recent years with alternatives such as the many-worlds interpretation gaining notable adherents.\n2While the distinction between logical positivism and logical empiricism- as found in the Berlin Circle- is not without significance, for the purposes of this paper we may conflate the two.\n3With Neurath, I myself prefer physicalism.\n4Similar to logical positivism, the Copenhagen interpretation consists of a collection of types of interpretations which more or less agree on the essential points.\nReferences\nAyer, A.J.

There is a distinct place for skeptics in parapsychology and other fringe science areas. They improve methodology, catch fraud, and tighten up discipline. However, a skeptic who cannot conceive of evidence that would convince him of a paranormal claim has gone beyond skepticism. Let me draw a few arbitrary lines.\nPseudo Science - One believes what one wants to believe, and justifies it with a sprinkling of scientific sounding words words and some specious logic. Theory, observation, nor experiment are less important than wishful thinking. The world is full of mystery and crazy things.\nScience - One has experimental data or observed phenomena one can't explain, or one has a theory that needs to be tested by experiment or observation. One is dealing with the unknown. The world needs to be studied, is not fully explained.\nEngineering - One knows enough about how the world works to achieve practical results. The theory is taken from the scientists. One isn't doing experimentation as much as one is testing one's design or confirming performance of the implementation. The world is comfortable and known.\nDogma - One's theories are assumed to be perfect. New theory which conflicts with existing theory is arbitrarily rejected. New data which cannot be explained is assumed to be faked or resulting from bad observations. The world is full of kooks who are soft in the head.\nYes, I'm biased towards science and engineering. Yes, the lines are much grayer and fuzzier in the real world than the above would indicate. Still, may both the pseudo scientists and the skeptical dogmatics have joy of one another. A plague on both their houses.\nNovella's Quantum Confusion may be erring a bit towards the side of establishment dogma. It is a solid presentation of the more conservative views of quantum mechanics. His warnings about abuse of the theory by pseudo science are valid. Still, when one has experimental evidence of retrocausality, one has to account for the experimental results. Without evidence of retrocausality, Novella's invocation of Occam's Razor to favor Copenhagen Convention over Many Worlds is valid. When one has retrocausal experiments to account for, it is harder to dismiss the Many Worlds.\nThe options are 1) perform the experiment to prove or disprove the theory, 2) ignore the evidence, 3) come up with a better theory which explains the evidence with fewer really weird implications. Explaining retrocausality while avoiding really weird implications is really rough.\nBob Butler\nQuantum Mechanics is undoubtedly one of the most significant scientific achievements of the twentieth century. Its descriptions of the behavior of atoms and light have been substantiated in countless experiments for the past seventy years. It has elucidated diverse phenomena from the shining of stars to the order of the periodic table and it has spawned many of the technologies that we take for granted today, such as personal computers, lasers, superconductors, and nuclear power. The events that Quantum theory describes, however, are very counterintuitive and paradoxical when compared to everyday reality. Consider the following: experiments tell us that light is both a wave and a particle depending on what you are trying to detect, electrons can tunnel through barriers with no openings and signals can propagate through the universe instantly even over many light years.\nThe success of Quantum Mechanics (QM) and its apparent irrationalities have not been missed by believers of the paranormal, anxious for scientific justification of their beliefs. They have appropriated it to explain a host of psychic phenomena, including e.s.p., remote viewing, and the belief that human consciousness can control the content of reality. The fact that QM is bizarre, however, does not mean that it can be used to explain bizarre theories. Unusual behavior in the microworld does not necessarily translate into the macroworld; in fact there is no evidence to suggest that QM can be used as an explanation for paranormal phenomena.\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century physicists realized that classical physics could not explain the very small as well as it did the very large. Common objects of everyday experience, like baseballs and even planets, yielded exquisitely to the mathematics developed over the preceding centuries. Solar eclipses and planetary motion could be predicted centuries in the future or retrodicted centuries in the past. But the world of atoms remained extremely puzzling. Conventional theories made predictions that could not be reconciled with reality regardless of the experiment. One of the glaring anomalies predicted by classical physics was that atoms should not exist; electrons should quickly spiral into the nucleus collapsing the atom and preventing the existence of stars and galaxies, and therefore life. Another problem was the prediction of an \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" in which solids were predicted to emit infinite energy when heated. These effects were, of course, not observed so either classical physics had to be modified or a new theory was needed that would more closely mirror reality. Quantum Theory accomplished the latter by positing that atomic orbits and energy itself is quantized. Nature, it appeared, was not continuous with smoothly changing and infinitely variable energies and orbits but came in discrete, grainy chunks. An analogy can be made between energy existing in indivisible units, just like people in the population. There can't be two and one half people or four and nine tenths but only whole amounts, like three or four. The universe is quantized like people are quantized. This view of nature explained the bizarre predictions of classical physics and in the process changed our view of the world as well as its economies.\nWhile Quantum Mechanics was being fleshed out in the first quarter of this century, it soon became apparent that quantum weirdness and paradoxes were inescapable. Thomas Young's double slit experiment in the early 1800's had conclusively shown that light was composed of waves due to the interference patterns it produced, but Einstein's 1905 photoelectric effect demonstrated equally well that light was composed of particles. The only possible conclusion was that light was both, a \"wave-particle duality.\" Light has both particle and wavelike aspects that reveal themselves depending on the type of experiment conducted. If you look for particles, then light is a particle, if you look for waves, then light is a wave. Never can they both reveal themselves at the same time. These mutually exclusive properties of light and matter were later codified in Werner Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle in 1927. This law states that it is impossible to determine at the same time and with arbitrary accuracy pairs of physical properties dealing with space-time and energy. The classic example of these so called \"conjugate variables\" are position and momentum, although many more exist. The more accurately position is determined, the less accurately momentum can be determined. Both values can be resolved at the same time but not with a high degree of accuracy. If position is determined precisely then nothing can be known about momentum and vice versa. This is not due to the inadequacy of the instruments at our disposal nor is it because we haven't figured out a way to do it yet; it is a fundamental aspect of nature. In one stroke the uncertainty principle did away with Newtonian determinism and his clockwork universe in which everything can be predicted if extrapolations are made from the current positions and momenta of all particles. If these variables cannot even in principle be determined accurately at the quantum level, precisely predicting the future of a particle is forever beyond our grasp. For this reason long term weather prediction will never be possible because meteorologists cannot determine precisely the current state of the atmosphere. If human culture is in existence one million years and the pace of scientific advance has not slackened, the uncertainty principle will still be with us, fundamentally limiting what we can know about the universe.\nOne of the apparent paradoxes of QM, non-locality, has been used by quantum mystics to support their holistic view of the universe, that everything in the universe comprises one interconnected whole in which all parts communicate with each other at infinite speeds. Non-locality is the ostensible transfer of information at superluminal (faster than light) speeds, something that Einstein's theory of relativity, and countless experiments, tell us is impossible. This, they explain, is how psychics can instantly know things that happen on the other side of the country or the planet. Even physicists are not immune to mystical thinking. As Amit Goswami put it, \"...it is logical to conclude that psychic phenomenon, such as distant viewing and out-of-body experiences, are examples of the nonlocal operation of consciousness. ...Quantum mechanics undergirds such a theory by providing crucial support for the case of nonlocality of consciousness.\"\nAs an example of superluminal communication I will describe an experiment involving what is called quantum entanglement, in which pairs of particles are correlated even though they are separated from each other. Certain subatomic particles can produce pairs of photons when they decay. These photons race away from each other at the speed of light and have certain restrictions with regard to their properties. If the parent particle had zero angular momentum (rotational energy), the resulting two photon system must also have zero angular momentum, otherwise spin would have been created from nothing, violating the law of energy conservation. Therefore if photon one has spin up in the x-axis then photon two must have spin down in its' x-axis. In this sense the photons are entangled because the measurement of spin in one photon means that the other photon must have the opposite spin in the same axis of rotation. This might not seem too unusual but the predominant interpretation of QM, the Copenhagen interpretation, tells us that at the quantum level nothing is real unless you look at it (bounce radiation off it). Until then quantum systems exist only as a wave of probability, called a wave function, that collapses into reality during measurement and then disperses again when you're done looking at it. Another way to look at this is that the spin of the particle is a superposition (a mixture) of all possible spins (up and down in this case) and when an observation takes place one particular spin becomes real. The probability of each spin depends on its wave function. ( It is this inherent probabilistic nature of QM that bothered Einstein so greatly, causing him to remark \"God does not play dice.\") So what we have in this experiment are twin state photons both consisting of spin up and spin down at the same time. At the instant of measurement the wave function for the two photon system collapses, one photon becoming spin up and the other spin down. In order for each to have an opposite spin it appears that an instantaneous communication occurs between them, what Einstein called \"spooky action at a distance.\"\nThis non-local connection is what quantum mystics have latched onto offering it as scientific evidence that everything everywhere is intimately and instantly connected or holistic. Ostensibly this might seem to be a reasonable mechanism for telepathy, assuming that it even exists, but this belief stems from a misunderstanding. Quantum Mechanics does not imply that information can travel instantly, in fact superluminal information transfer has been proven impossible in any theory consistent with relativity or quantum mechanics. (Eberhard and Ross 1989) It has been shown that if a faster than light communication device were setup using non-locality, each isolated observer would only see a random fluctuation of signals, nothing comprehensible could be interpreted. Therefore, even if our brains could operate nonlocally they would not receive any usable information. The violation of locality only occurs within our macrosopic description of the quantum event. So even in the strange world of Quantum Mechanics psychics and mystics cannot find scientific sanctuary.\nIn the next issue of The Connecticut Skeptic, part II of this article will explore the paranormal claim that consciousness creates reality.\nReferences:\n1) Stenger, V.

Lett., 1989\nPART 2\nby Robert Novella\nThe Connecticut Skeptic Vol. 2 Issue 4(Fall '97) pg 14\nPart one of Quantum Confusion discussed the early development of quantum theory and how nonlocality (the ostensibly superluminal transfer of information) cannot be used to support paranormal phenomena such as e.s.p. In part two we will discuss the relationship between quantum mechanics and consciousness and how the theory has been misinterpreted to support the contention that consciousness creates reality.\nThe latter part of the twentieth century is seeing a resurgence of mystical thinking that seems out of place and anachronistic in our highly technological society. But science and technology are not completely shunned by these born again mystics. Scientific progress and technological innovation have produced unparalleled and undeniable advances that cannot be ignored even by the most anti-science luddites. Anyone that claims scientific backing for their wild theories garners a degree of respect and authority that nothing else can offer.\nThis is what quantum mystics have done when they claim that the most successful and well tested theories of the past one hundred years (quantum mechanics) supports their views of the universe. They contend that quantum mechanics (QM) legitimizes their ancient belief that human consciousness determines the content of reality. We are to believe that human thought, not matter and energy is the basic stuff of the universe. Scientific observations, however, do not support this radial claim. There is no compelling evidence or argument to support the belief that the physical universe is only an imaginary byproduct of the mind. This idea results from a misinterpretation of QM, a mistranslation from the mathematical to the philosophical.\nInterest in quantum mysticism can be traced back to 1975 with the publication of Fritjof Capra\u00eds The Tao of Physics. In it he contended that QM substantiated the traditional teachings of Eastern mystics: that human consciousness is inextricably linked to the universe forming an inseparable whole. The following quote is representative: \"Thoughts and emotions create physical processes...the world, including the experience of your body, is completely determined by how you learn to perceive it\" (Capra 1975). In the 90\u00eds, Deepak Chopra has written many best selling books with \"quantum\" in the title, including Quantum Healing: Exploring the Frontiers of Mind/Body Medicine and Ageless Body, Timeless Mind: The Quantum Alternative to Growing Old. In these books Chopra promulgates his brand of alternative medicine, quantum healing, in which the mind alone can heal all ills and afford us virtual immortality. Chopra echoes Capra in the following: \"The physical world, including our bodies, is a response of the observer. We create our bodies as we create the experience of our world\", \"Beliefs, thoughts, and emotions create the chemical reactions that uphold life in every cell\"(Chopra 1993).\nIf we believe these authors, twentieth century physics has revealed that the materialist and reductionist world views have been invalidated. Spiritualism and holism, we are to believe, are the new paradigms, exemplified by an incorporeal cosmic mind that is ultimately in control of reality.\nHow has quantum mechanics lead people to believe that the human mind is the final arbiter of reality? Part of the problem stems from the fact that the mathematics of quantum theory is being translated into words, a so called ontological interpretation. Just because a theory or equation can be expressed mathematically does not automatically imply that it is fully understood. There are many philosophical interpretations of QM, many of which show no difference in their empirical results and since they do not provide their own unique predictions they then can be considered equivalent. For every interpretation of QM that is used to support paranormal claims there is another that is no worse but does not offer ostensible support for paranormal claims.\nThe most oft abused interpretation of QM, the Copenhagen Interpretation, is also the mostly widely supported among physicists. One major tenet of this interpretation involves the collapse of the quantum wavefunction. This wavefunction is a mathematical description of a quantum system that describes all the possible states that system can be in. It is essentially a collection of probabilities that can be used, for example, to determine the probability that a particle will be found in a certain position. Before the measurement is made QM tells us that the particle is in all possible positions, what is called a superposition of states. When the particle is observed its position is then known with greater accuracy and the wavefunction is said to \"collapse\" into a definite state, the reality that we observe. Mystics view the wavefunction as a vibration of a universal aether that pervades the cosmos, as real as a sound or water wave. In their view the collapse occurs due to our thoughts or even the thoughts of an omnipresent cosmic consciousness of which we are all apart. In The Conscious Universe Menas Kafatos and Robert Nadeau unite the concept of the wavefunction and existence. \"One could then conclude that Being, in its physical analogue at least, had been \"revealed\" in the wavefunction...\" (Kafatos and Nadeau 1990,124) It is this wavefunction collapse brought about by a human mediated act of measurement or observation that has caused the confusion between quantum theory and consciousness. Since human consciousness ultimately makes the observation it must be intimately connected to the wavefunction and its collapse. This argument dissolves into sophistry, however, by the fact that the quantum wavefunction is not a physical tangible object that can be manipulated by a human mind. The Copenhagen Interpretation makes it clear that it is just a mathematical tool, an abstraction that does whatever the equations tell it to do. Physicist Henry Pierce Stapp of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory echoed fellow physicists with this quote: \"In the Copenhagen interpretation the notion of an absolute wavefunction representing the world itself is unequivocally rejected. The probabilities involved are the probabilities of specified responses in the measuring devices under specified conditions\"\nThe Many Worlds Interpretation of QM is yet another interpretation that has been misinterpreted to support paranormal beliefs. This view, developed by John Wheeler and Hugh Everett at Princeton, asserts that there is no wavefunction collapse. If a quantum system has ten different states into which it can change then the universe splits into 10 copies of itself each with a different outcome for that quantum event. For example, when a photon encounters a situation in which it can take one of many different paths, we get a new universe for each and every possible outcome. The universe then is like a bush that is constantly branching into new sub-universes every femtosecond. Once a branch occurs there is no way to go back to a previous branch nor get any information about it. Even this interpretation with its removal of the wavefunction has been used to \"prove\" that consciousness controls the universe. The human mind in this view is seen as a \"channel selector\" guiding the branching and sub-branching that an individual universe takes. This Many Worlds view, though intriguing, has not been met with overwhelming support by physicists. Many of them consider it highly implausible that the universe behaves the way it describes and feel that wavefunction collapse is much more reasonable. More damning is the fact that predictions for experimental outcomes do not vary from the orthodox Copenhagen Interpretation. When two theories can explain a phenomenon scientists defer to the principle of economy, or Occam's Razor, which states that the theory with the fewest assumptions is preferred. A collapsing wavefunction is much simpler than a universe that is forever splitting.\nThe Quantum Mechanical descriptions of the interactions between observers and observables have led some to conclude that human consciousness is responsible for the content of reality. Some experiments have features that appear to involve the superluminal transfer of information which is interpreted as evidence for an instantaneous holistic universe in which everything is one interconnected whole. (see part one of this article) Although various interpretations have been argued about for many years, the conventional formulation of Quantum Mechanics has been overwhelmingly supported by countless experiments none of which violate a view of the universe that is reductionist, discrete, non-local, and non-holistic with no fundamental role for human consciousness. Despite the fact that psi phenomena have no such experimental backing (or perhaps because of it) true believers have usurped Quantum Mechanics to support their belief system. Victor Stenger said it best: \"They use scientific argument not as a spade to probe for unknown answers to deep questions but as a brush to lay down a veneer of respectability over answers they have already determined.\" (Prometheus, 1995)\nReferences:\n1)Victor J.
